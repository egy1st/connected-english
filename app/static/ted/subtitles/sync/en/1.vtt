WEBVTT

00:00:15.487 --> 00:00:16.678
Thank you so much, Chris.

00:00:16.702 --> 00:00:20.652
And it's truly a great honor
to have the opportunity

00:00:20.676 --> 00:00:23.680
to come to this stage twice;
I'm extremely grateful.

00:00:23.704 --> 00:00:27.238
I have been blown away by this conference,

00:00:27.262 --> 00:00:32.930
and I want to thank all of you
for the many nice comments

00:00:32.954 --> 00:00:35.126
about what I had to say the other night.

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:38.025
And I say that sincerely,

00:00:38.049 --> 00:00:40.013
partly because (Mock sob)

00:00:40.037 --> 00:00:41.188
I need that.

00:00:41.212 --> 00:00:47.069
(Laughter)

00:00:47.093 --> 00:00:49.014
Put yourselves in my position.

00:00:49.038 --> 00:00:55.566
(Laughter)

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.147
I flew on Air Force Two for eight years.

00:00:58.171 --> 00:01:00.126
(Laughter)

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:03.514
Now I have to take off my shoes
or boots to get on an airplane!

00:01:03.538 --> 00:01:06.243
(Laughter)

00:01:06.267 --> 00:01:12.715
(Applause)

00:01:12.739 --> 00:01:14.462
I'll tell you one quick story

00:01:14.486 --> 00:01:17.605
to illustrate what
that's been like for me.

00:01:17.629 --> 00:01:19.150
(Laughter)

00:01:19.174 --> 00:01:21.594
It's a true story --
every bit of this is true.

00:01:22.308 --> 00:01:25.893
Soon after Tipper and I left the --
(Mock sob) White House --

00:01:25.917 --> 00:01:27.935
(Laughter)

00:01:27.959 --> 00:01:32.874
we were driving from our home
in Nashville to a little farm we have

00:01:32.898 --> 00:01:34.889
50 miles east of Nashville.

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:37.640
Driving ourselves.

00:01:37.664 --> 00:01:40.126
(Laughter)

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:42.867
I know it sounds like
a little thing to you, but --

00:01:42.891 --> 00:01:48.360
(Laughter)

00:01:48.384 --> 00:01:54.091
I looked in the rear-view mirror

00:01:54.115 --> 00:01:57.321
and all of a sudden it just hit me.

00:01:57.345 --> 00:01:58.981
There was no motorcade back there.

00:01:59.005 --> 00:02:01.659
(Laughter)

00:02:01.683 --> 00:02:03.676
You've heard of phantom limb pain?

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:08.512
(Laughter)

00:02:08.536 --> 00:02:12.752
This was a rented Ford Taurus.

00:02:12.776 --> 00:02:15.280
(Laughter)

00:02:15.304 --> 00:02:17.310
It was dinnertime,

00:02:17.334 --> 00:02:20.254
and we started looking for a place to eat.

00:02:20.738 --> 00:02:22.143
We were on I-40.

00:02:22.167 --> 00:02:25.364
We got to Exit 238, Lebanon, Tennessee.

00:02:25.388 --> 00:02:29.076
We got off the exit,
we found a Shoney's restaurant.

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:33.139
Low-cost family restaurant chain,
for those of you who don't know it.

00:02:34.027 --> 00:02:38.462
We went in and sat down at the booth,
and the waitress came over,

00:02:38.486 --> 00:02:40.472
made a big commotion over Tipper.

00:02:40.496 --> 00:02:42.959
(Laughter)

00:02:42.983 --> 00:02:46.403
She took our order, and then went
to the couple in the booth next to us,

00:02:46.427 --> 00:02:48.531
and she lowered her voice so much,

00:02:48.555 --> 00:02:51.556
I had to really strain to hear
what she was saying.

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:54.259
And she said "Yes, that's former
Vice President Al Gore

00:02:54.283 --> 00:02:56.126
and his wife, Tipper."

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:57.677
And the man said,

00:02:57.701 --> 00:02:59.893
"He's come down a long way, hasn't he?"

00:02:59.917 --> 00:03:04.825
(Laughter)

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:09.126
(Applause)

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:12.269
There's been kind
of a series of epiphanies.

00:03:12.293 --> 00:03:13.437
(Laughter)

00:03:13.461 --> 00:03:17.126
The very next day,
continuing the totally true story,

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:23.126
I got on a G-V to fly to Africa
to make a speech in Nigeria,

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:26.006
in the city of Lagos,
on the topic of energy.

00:03:26.451 --> 00:03:30.247
And I began the speech
by telling them the story

00:03:30.271 --> 00:03:32.984
of what had just happened
the day before in Nashville.

00:03:33.346 --> 00:03:36.652
And I told it pretty much the same way
I've just shared it with you:

00:03:36.676 --> 00:03:38.414
Tipper and I were driving ourselves,

00:03:38.438 --> 00:03:40.476
Shoney's, low-cost
family restaurant chain,

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:42.433
what the man said -- they laughed.

00:03:42.853 --> 00:03:46.436
I gave my speech, then went back
out to the airport to fly back home.

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:48.326
I fell asleep on the plane

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:50.888
until, during the middle
of the night, we landed

00:03:50.912 --> 00:03:53.126
on the Azores Islands for refueling.

00:03:53.514 --> 00:03:56.626
I woke up, they opened the door,
I went out to get some fresh air,

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:00.126
and I looked, and there was a man
running across the runway.

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:03.205
And he was waving a piece
of paper, and he was yelling,

00:04:03.229 --> 00:04:07.303
"Call Washington! Call Washington!"

00:04:08.131 --> 00:04:10.576
And I thought to myself,
in the middle of the night,

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:12.036
in the middle of the Atlantic,

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:14.280
what in the world could be
wrong in Washington?

00:04:14.304 --> 00:04:16.565
Then I remembered
it could be a bunch of things.

00:04:16.589 --> 00:04:22.126
(Laughter)

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:24.077
But what it turned out to be,

00:04:24.101 --> 00:04:27.412
was that my staff was extremely upset

00:04:27.436 --> 00:04:33.638
because one of the wire services
in Nigeria had already written a story

00:04:33.662 --> 00:04:35.082
about my speech,

00:04:35.106 --> 00:04:37.082
and it had already been printed in cities

00:04:37.106 --> 00:04:39.438
all across the United States of America.

00:04:39.462 --> 00:04:41.290
It was printed in Monterey, I checked.

00:04:41.314 --> 00:04:42.464
(Laughter)

00:04:42.703 --> 00:04:45.364
And the story began,

00:04:45.388 --> 00:04:49.681
"Former Vice President Al Gore
announced in Nigeria yesterday," quote:

00:04:49.705 --> 00:04:53.334
'My wife Tipper and I have opened
a low-cost family restaurant'" --

00:04:53.358 --> 00:04:55.000
(Laughter)

00:04:55.024 --> 00:04:56.372
"'named Shoney's,

00:04:56.396 --> 00:04:58.195
and we are running it ourselves.'"

00:04:58.219 --> 00:05:01.539
(Laughter)

00:05:01.563 --> 00:05:03.721
Before I could get back to U.S. soil,

00:05:03.745 --> 00:05:07.859
David Letterman and Jay Leno
had already started in on --

00:05:07.883 --> 00:05:11.126
one of them had me
in a big white chef's hat,

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:13.579
Tipper was saying,
"One more burger with fries!"

00:05:13.603 --> 00:05:14.650
(Laughter)

00:05:14.674 --> 00:05:15.956
Three days later,

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:18.719
I got a nice, long, handwritten letter

00:05:18.743 --> 00:05:22.164
from my friend and partner
and colleague Bill Clinton, saying,

00:05:22.188 --> 00:05:24.584
"Congratulations
on the new restaurant, Al!"

00:05:24.608 --> 00:05:31.281
(Laughter)

00:05:31.305 --> 00:05:34.442
We like to celebrate
each other's successes in life.

00:05:34.466 --> 00:05:39.863
(Laughter)

00:05:40.756 --> 00:05:43.303
I was going to talk
about information ecology.

00:05:43.327 --> 00:05:45.345
But I was thinking that,

00:05:45.369 --> 00:05:49.126
since I plan to make a lifelong habit
of coming back to TED,

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:51.843
that maybe I could talk
about that another time.

00:05:51.867 --> 00:05:53.267
(Applause)

00:05:53.291 --> 00:05:54.688
Chris Anderson: It's a deal!

00:05:54.712 --> 00:05:57.338
(Applause)

00:05:57.362 --> 00:06:01.880
Al Gore: I want to focus
on what many of you have said

00:06:01.904 --> 00:06:03.770
you would like me to elaborate on:

00:06:03.794 --> 00:06:07.611
What can you do about the climate crisis?

00:06:08.467 --> 00:06:11.806
I want to start with a couple of --

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:14.399
I'm going to show some new images,

00:06:14.423 --> 00:06:19.546
and I'm going to recapitulate
just four or five.

00:06:20.225 --> 00:06:21.797
Now, the slide show.

00:06:21.821 --> 00:06:25.126
I update the slide show
every time I give it.

00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:26.387
I add new images,

00:06:26.411 --> 00:06:29.316
because I learn more about it
every time I give it.

00:06:29.973 --> 00:06:31.924
It's like beach-combing, you know?

00:06:31.948 --> 00:06:35.126
Every time the tide comes in and out,
you find some more shells.

00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:41.133
Just in the last two days, we got
the new temperature records in January.

00:06:41.157 --> 00:06:44.167
This is just for
the United States of America.

00:06:44.191 --> 00:06:46.929
Historical average
for Januarys is 31 degrees;

00:06:46.953 --> 00:06:50.637
last month was 39.5 degrees.

00:06:51.082 --> 00:06:55.895
Now, I know that you wanted some more
bad news about the environment --

00:06:55.919 --> 00:06:57.087
I'm kidding.

00:06:57.554 --> 00:07:00.610
But these are the recapitulation slides,

00:07:00.634 --> 00:07:04.028
and then I'm going to go into new
material about what you can do.

00:07:04.052 --> 00:07:06.447
But I wanted to elaborate
on a couple of these.

00:07:06.471 --> 00:07:09.782
First of all, this is where
we're projected to go

00:07:09.806 --> 00:07:11.908
with the U.S. contribution
to global warming,

00:07:11.932 --> 00:07:13.716
under business as usual.

00:07:13.740 --> 00:07:19.126
Efficiency in end-use electricity
and end-use of all energy

00:07:19.150 --> 00:07:20.774
is the low-hanging fruit.

00:07:20.798 --> 00:07:25.302
Efficiency and conservation --
it's not a cost; it's a profit.

00:07:25.326 --> 00:07:28.003
The sign is wrong.

00:07:28.027 --> 00:07:30.170
It's not negative; it's positive.

00:07:30.194 --> 00:07:33.034
These are investments
that pay for themselves.

00:07:33.058 --> 00:07:36.929
But they are also very effective
in deflecting our path.

00:07:37.770 --> 00:07:41.765
Cars and trucks -- I talked
about that in the slideshow,

00:07:41.789 --> 00:07:44.281
but I want you to put it in perspective.

00:07:45.043 --> 00:07:49.640
It's an easy, visible target of concern --

00:07:49.664 --> 00:07:51.126
and it should be --

00:07:51.150 --> 00:07:55.829
but there is more global warming pollution
that comes from buildings

00:07:55.853 --> 00:07:57.575
than from cars and trucks.

00:07:58.150 --> 00:08:00.791
Cars and trucks are very significant,

00:08:00.815 --> 00:08:03.400
and we have the lowest
standards in the world.

00:08:03.424 --> 00:08:06.450
And so we should address that.
But it's part of the puzzle.

00:08:06.474 --> 00:08:11.835
Other transportation efficiency
is as important as cars and trucks.

00:08:11.859 --> 00:08:16.201
Renewables at the current levels
of technological efficiency

00:08:16.225 --> 00:08:17.972
can make this much difference.

00:08:17.996 --> 00:08:23.951
And with what Vinod, and John Doerr
and others, many of you here --

00:08:23.975 --> 00:08:26.542
there are a lot of people
directly involved in this --

00:08:26.566 --> 00:08:29.098
this wedge is going to grow
much more rapidly

00:08:29.122 --> 00:08:31.309
than the current projection shows it.

00:08:31.333 --> 00:08:37.073
Carbon Capture and Sequestration --
that's what CCS stands for --

00:08:37.097 --> 00:08:43.912
is likely to become the killer app
that will enable us

00:08:43.936 --> 00:08:50.347
to continue to use fossil fuels
in a way that is safe.

00:08:51.609 --> 00:08:52.945
Not quite there yet.

00:08:52.969 --> 00:08:56.135
OK. Now, what can you do?

00:08:58.645 --> 00:09:00.402
Reduce emissions in your home.

00:09:01.172 --> 00:09:05.370
Most of these expenditures
are also profitable.

00:09:06.157 --> 00:09:08.126
Insulation, better design.

00:09:08.150 --> 00:09:10.839
Buy green electricity where you can.

00:09:11.586 --> 00:09:15.396
I mentioned automobiles -- buy a hybrid.

00:09:15.420 --> 00:09:17.126
Use light rail.

00:09:17.655 --> 00:09:20.437
Figure out some of the other options
that are much better.

00:09:20.461 --> 00:09:21.626
It's important.

00:09:22.404 --> 00:09:24.123
Be a green consumer.

00:09:24.147 --> 00:09:27.126
You have choices with everything you buy,

00:09:27.150 --> 00:09:30.757
between things that have a harsh effect,

00:09:30.781 --> 00:09:36.281
or a much less harsh effect
on the global climate crisis.

00:09:37.020 --> 00:09:38.852
Consider this:

00:09:38.876 --> 00:09:42.128
Make a decision to live
a carbon-neutral life.

00:09:42.813 --> 00:09:45.247
Those of you who are good at branding,

00:09:45.271 --> 00:09:47.743
I'd love to get your advice and help

00:09:47.767 --> 00:09:53.845
on how to say this in a way
that connects with the most people.

00:09:53.869 --> 00:09:55.850
It is easier than you think.

00:09:55.874 --> 00:09:57.190
It really is.

00:09:59.373 --> 00:10:02.768
A lot of us in here
have made that decision,

00:10:02.792 --> 00:10:04.926
and it is really pretty easy.

00:10:04.950 --> 00:10:10.877
It means reduce
your carbon dioxide emissions

00:10:10.901 --> 00:10:13.597
with the full range
of choices that you make,

00:10:13.621 --> 00:10:17.746
and then purchase or acquire offsets

00:10:17.770 --> 00:10:20.887
for the remainder that you have not
completely reduced.

00:10:20.911 --> 00:10:27.401
And what it means is elaborated
at climatecrisis.net.

00:10:27.905 --> 00:10:30.770
There is a carbon calculator.

00:10:31.651 --> 00:10:35.126
Participant Productions convened --

00:10:35.150 --> 00:10:37.720
with my active involvement --

00:10:37.744 --> 00:10:40.561
the leading software writers in the world,

00:10:40.585 --> 00:10:43.888
on this arcane science
of carbon calculation,

00:10:43.912 --> 00:10:48.014
to construct a consumer-friendly
carbon calculator.

00:10:48.467 --> 00:10:54.676
You can very precisely calculate
what your CO2 emissions are,

00:10:54.700 --> 00:10:58.018
and then you will be given
options to reduce.

00:10:58.042 --> 00:11:01.239
And by the time the movie
comes out in May,

00:11:01.263 --> 00:11:03.126
this will be updated to 2.0,

00:11:03.150 --> 00:11:06.584
and we will have click-through
purchases of offsets.

00:11:07.150 --> 00:11:10.372
Next, consider making
your business carbon-neutral.

00:11:10.396 --> 00:11:12.004
Again, some of us have done that,

00:11:12.028 --> 00:11:14.034
and it's not as hard as you think.

00:11:15.346 --> 00:11:19.536
Integrate climate solutions
into all of your innovations,

00:11:19.560 --> 00:11:21.473
whether you are from the technology,

00:11:21.497 --> 00:11:25.126
or entertainment, or design
and architecture community.

00:11:25.150 --> 00:11:27.193
Invest sustainably.

00:11:27.217 --> 00:11:28.906
Majora mentioned this.

00:11:29.398 --> 00:11:36.190
Listen, if you have invested money
with managers who you compensate

00:11:36.214 --> 00:11:38.931
on the basis of their annual performance,

00:11:38.955 --> 00:11:43.867
don't ever again complain
about quarterly report CEO management.

00:11:44.957 --> 00:11:47.513
Over time, people do
what you pay them to do.

00:11:48.886 --> 00:11:53.579
And if they judge how much
they're going to get paid

00:11:53.603 --> 00:11:56.903
on your capital that they've invested,

00:11:56.927 --> 00:11:58.870
based on the short-term returns,

00:11:58.894 --> 00:12:01.210
you're going to get short-term decisions.

00:12:03.149 --> 00:12:04.762
A lot more to be said about that.

00:12:04.786 --> 00:12:06.532
Become a catalyst of change.

00:12:06.556 --> 00:12:10.191
Teach others, learn about it,
talk about it.

00:12:11.413 --> 00:12:14.818
The movie is a movie version
of the slideshow

00:12:14.842 --> 00:12:17.761
I gave two nights ago,
except it's a lot more entertaining.

00:12:18.844 --> 00:12:20.991
And it comes out in May.

00:12:21.587 --> 00:12:25.548
Many of you here have the opportunity
to ensure that a lot of people see it.

00:12:27.256 --> 00:12:30.859
Consider sending somebody to Nashville.

00:12:31.540 --> 00:12:32.695
Pick well.

00:12:33.531 --> 00:12:37.977
And I am personally going to train people
to give this slideshow --

00:12:38.001 --> 00:12:42.756
re-purposed, with some
of the personal stories obviously replaced

00:12:42.780 --> 00:12:44.850
with a generic approach,

00:12:44.874 --> 00:12:47.573
and it's not just the slides,
it's what they mean.

00:12:47.597 --> 00:12:49.198
And it's how they link together.

00:12:49.222 --> 00:12:53.809
And so I'm going to be conducting
a course this summer

00:12:53.833 --> 00:12:57.668
for a group of people that are
nominated by different folks

00:12:57.692 --> 00:12:59.921
to come and then give it en masse,

00:12:59.945 --> 00:13:02.126
in communities all across the country,

00:13:02.150 --> 00:13:06.815
and we're going to update the slideshow
for all of them every single week,

00:13:06.839 --> 00:13:09.870
to keep it right on the cutting edge.

00:13:09.894 --> 00:13:13.775
Working with Larry Lessig, it will be,
somewhere in that process,

00:13:13.799 --> 00:13:18.634
posted with tools
and limited-use copyrights,

00:13:18.658 --> 00:13:24.126
so that young people can remix it
and do it in their own way.

00:13:24.150 --> 00:13:27.296
(Applause)

00:13:27.320 --> 00:13:28.810
Where did anybody get the idea

00:13:28.834 --> 00:13:31.186
that you ought to stay
arm's length from politics?

00:13:31.210 --> 00:13:33.300
It doesn't mean
that if you're a Republican,

00:13:33.324 --> 00:13:35.648
that I'm trying to convince you
to be a Democrat.

00:13:36.085 --> 00:13:37.590
We need Republicans as well.

00:13:37.614 --> 00:13:39.623
This used to be a bipartisan issue,

00:13:39.647 --> 00:13:42.104
and I know that
in this group it really is.

00:13:42.128 --> 00:13:43.680
Become politically active.

00:13:43.704 --> 00:13:46.577
Make our democracy work the way
it's supposed to work.

00:13:46.903 --> 00:13:52.452
Support the idea of capping
carbon dioxide emissions --

00:13:52.476 --> 00:13:54.491
global warming pollution --
and trading it.

00:13:54.515 --> 00:13:59.126
Here's why: as long as the United States
is out of the world system,

00:13:59.150 --> 00:14:00.818
it's not a closed system.

00:14:00.842 --> 00:14:04.889
Once it becomes a closed system,
with U.S. participation,

00:14:04.913 --> 00:14:07.136
then everybody
who's on a board of directors --

00:14:07.160 --> 00:14:10.149
how many people here
serve on the board of directors

00:14:10.173 --> 00:14:11.427
of a corporation?

00:14:12.565 --> 00:14:13.991
Once it's a closed system,

00:14:14.015 --> 00:14:20.252
you will have legal liability
if you do not urge your CEO

00:14:20.276 --> 00:14:24.403
to get the maximum income from reducing
and trading the carbon emissions

00:14:24.427 --> 00:14:25.736
that can be avoided.

00:14:25.760 --> 00:14:28.425
The market will work
to solve this problem --

00:14:31.099 --> 00:14:33.316
if we can accomplish this.

00:14:34.584 --> 00:14:37.969
Help with the mass persuasion campaign
that will start this spring.

00:14:37.993 --> 00:14:40.501
We have to change the minds
of the American people.

00:14:40.525 --> 00:14:43.284
Because presently, the politicians
do not have permission

00:14:43.308 --> 00:14:45.227
to do what needs to be done.

00:14:45.505 --> 00:14:50.959
And in our modern country, the role
of logic and reason no longer includes

00:14:50.983 --> 00:14:53.937
mediating between wealth and power
the way it once did.

00:14:53.961 --> 00:14:59.521
It's now repetition of short, hot-button,
30-second, 28-second television ads.

00:14:59.545 --> 00:15:01.403
We have to buy a lot of those ads.

00:15:02.371 --> 00:15:06.681
Let's re-brand global warming,
as many of you have suggested.

00:15:06.705 --> 00:15:09.574
I like "climate crisis"
instead of "climate collapse,"

00:15:09.598 --> 00:15:11.925
but again, those of you
who are good at branding,

00:15:11.949 --> 00:15:13.354
I need your help on this.

00:15:13.918 --> 00:15:18.018
Somebody said the test
we're facing now, a scientist told me,

00:15:18.042 --> 00:15:21.126
is whether the combination
of an opposable thumb

00:15:21.150 --> 00:15:23.967
and a neocortex is a viable combination.

00:15:24.097 --> 00:15:25.596
(Laughter)

00:15:25.975 --> 00:15:27.532
That's really true.

00:15:30.310 --> 00:15:33.710
I said the other night,
and I'll repeat now:

00:15:33.734 --> 00:15:35.899
this is not a political issue.

00:15:35.923 --> 00:15:41.462
Again, the Republicans here --
this shouldn't be partisan.

00:15:41.486 --> 00:15:45.126
You have more influence
than some of us who are Democrats do.

00:15:45.571 --> 00:15:47.047
This is an opportunity.

00:15:47.071 --> 00:15:51.923
Not just this, but connected
to the ideas that are here,

00:15:51.947 --> 00:15:53.875
to bring more coherence to them.

00:15:54.645 --> 00:15:55.811
We are one.

00:15:56.215 --> 00:15:58.550
Thank you very much, I appreciate it.

00:15:58.574 --> 00:16:04.816
(Applause)
