00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:14.150
Do you ever feel completely overwhelmed

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:17.150
when you're faced with a complex problem?

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:20.150
Well, I hope to change that in less than three minutes.

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:22.150
So, I hope to convince you that complex

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:24.150
doesn't always equal complicated.

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.150
So for me, a well-crafted baguette, fresh out of the oven,

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.150
is complex,

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:31.150
but a curry onion green olive poppy cheese bread

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:34.150
is complicated.

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:37.150
I'm an ecologist, and I study complexity. I love complexity.

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:40.150
And I study that in the natural world, the interconnectedness of species.

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:42.150
So here's a food web,

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:44.150
or a map of feeding links between species

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:47.150
that live in Alpine Lakes in the mountains of California.

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:49.150
And this is what happens to that food web

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:51.150
when it's stocked with non-native fish that never lived there before.

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:53.150
All the grayed-out species disappear.

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:55.150
Some are actually on the brink of extinction.

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:58.150
And lakes with fish have more mosquitos, even though they eat them.

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:00.150
These effects were all unanticipated,

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:02.150
and yet we're discovering they're predictable.

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:04.150
So I want to share with you a couple key insights

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:06.150
about complexity we're learning from studying nature

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.150
that maybe are applicable to other problems.

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:12.150
First is the simple power of good visualization tools

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.150
to help untangle complexity

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:17.150
and just encourage you to ask questions you didn't think of before.

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:20.150
For example, you could plot the flow of carbon

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:23.150
through corporate supply chains in a corporate ecosystem,

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:25.150
or the interconnections of habitat patches

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:28.150
for endangered species in Yosemite National Park.

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:30.150
The next thing is that if you want to predict

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.150
the effect of one species on another,

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:34.150
if you focus only on that link,

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:36.150
and then you black box the rest,

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.150
it's actually less predictable

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:41.150
than if you step back, consider the entire system -- all the species, all the links --

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:43.150
and from that place,

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:45.150
hone in on the sphere of influence that matters most.

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:47.150
And we're discovering, with our research,

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:49.150
that's often very local to the node you care about

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:51.150
within one or two degrees.

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:53.150
So the more you step back, embrace complexity,

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:55.150
the better chance you have of finding simple answers,

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:58.150
and it's often different than the simple answer that you started with.

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:02.150
So let's switch gears and look at a really complex problem

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:05.150
courtesy of the U.S. government.

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:08.150
This is a diagram of the U.S. counterinsurgency strategy in Afghanistan.

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:11.150
It was front page of the New York Times a couple months ago.

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:13.150
Instantly ridiculed by the media

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:15.150
for being so crazy complicated.

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:17.150
And the stated goal was to increase popular support

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:19.150
for the Afghan government.

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:21.150
Clearly a complex problem,

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:23.150
but is it complicated?

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:25.150
Well, when I saw this in the front page of the Times,

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:27.150
I thought, "Great. Finally something I can relate to.

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:29.150
I can sink my teeth into this."

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:32.150
So let's do it. So here we go for the first time ever,

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:35.150
a world premiere view of this spaghetti diagram as an ordered network.

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:37.150
The circled node is the one we're trying to influence --

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:39.150
popular support for the government.

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:41.150
And so now we can look one degrees, two degrees,

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:43.150
three degrees away from that node

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:46.150
and eliminate three-quarters of the diagram outside that sphere of influence.

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:48.150
Within that sphere,

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:51.150
most of those nodes are not actionable, like the harshness of the terrain,

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:54.150
and a very small minority are actual military actions.

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:57.150
Most are non-violent and they fall into two broad categories:

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:01.150
active engagement with ethnic rivalries and religious beliefs

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:03.150
and fair, transparent economic development

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:05.150
and provisioning of services.

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:08.150
I don't know about this, but this is what I can decipher from this diagram

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:10.150
in 24 seconds.

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:12.150
When you see a diagram like this, I don't want you to be afraid.

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:15.150
I want you to be excited. I want you to be relieved.

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:17.150
Because simple answers may emerge.

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:19.150
We're discovering in nature that simplicity often lies

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:21.150
on the other side of complexity.

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:24.150
So for any problem, the more you can zoom out and embrace complexity,

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:26.150
the better chance you have of zooming in

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:28.150
on the simple details that matter most.

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:30.150
Thank you.

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:33.150
(Applause)
