00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:17.150
Thank you very much.

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:20.150
Now, I've got a story for you.

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:23.150
When I arrived off the plane,

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:26.150
after a very long journey from the West of England,

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:29.150
my computer, my beloved laptop,

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:32.150
had gone mad,

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:35.150
and had -- oh! -- a bit like that! --

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:38.150
and the display on it --

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:41.150
anyway, the whole thing had burst.

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:45.150
And I went to the IT guys here

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:49.150
and a gentleman mended my computer,

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:52.150
and then he said, "What are you doing here?"

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:55.150
and I said "I'm playing the cello and I'm doing a bit of singing,"

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:58.150
and he said, "Oh, I sort of play the cello as well."

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:01.150
And I said, "Do you really?"

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:03.150
Anyway, so you're in for a treat,

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:05.150
because he's fantastic, and his name's Mark.

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:08.150
(Applause)

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:13.150
I am also joined by my partner in crime, Thomas Dolby.

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:16.150
(Applause)

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:19.150
This song is called "Farther than the Sun."

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:51.150
(Music)

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:55.150
♫ Strung in the wind I called you ♫

00:01:55.150 --> 00:02:01.150
♫ but you did not hear ... ♫

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:08.150
♫ And you're a plant that needs poor soil ♫

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:11.150
♫ and I have treated you too well ♫

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:14.150
♫ to give up flowers ... ♫

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:17.150
♫ Oh, I have been too rich for you ... ♫

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:29.150
♫ Farther than the sun from me ♫

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:36.150
♫ Farther than I'd have you be ♫

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:41.150
♫ And I go north, I get so cold ♫

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:45.150
♫ My heart is lava under stone ♫

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:48.150
♫ You are not worthy ♫

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:51.150
♫ You are not worthy ... ♫

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:57.150
♫ With your calculating eyes ♫

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:00.150
♫ spinning figures ♫

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:03.150
♫ you cannot see me ♫

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:06.150
♫ You cannot see me ... ♫

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:12.150
♫ And if I tell myself enough ♫

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:15.150
♫ I'll believe it ♫

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:19.150
♫ You are not worthy ♫

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:29.150
♫ The sea, it freezes over ... ♫

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:35.150
♫ to trap the light ♫

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:42.150
♫ And I'm in love with being in love ♫

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:47.150
♫ and you were never quite the one ♫

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:50.150
♫ In Gerda's eyes ♫

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:53.150
♫ Fragments of what you've become ♫

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:16.150
♫ And all the moths that fly at night ♫

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:19.150
♫ believe electric light is bright ♫

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:22.150
♫ You are not worthy ♫

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:25.150
♫ You are not worthy ♫

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:31.150
♫ With your calculating eyes ♫

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:34.150
♫ Spinning figures ♫

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:40.150
♫ You cannot see me, no ♫

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:45.150
♫ And if I tell myself enough ♫

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:49.150
♫ I'll believe it ♫

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:52.150
♫ You are not worthy ♫

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:24.150
♫ Farther than the sun from me ♫

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:31.150
♫ Farther than I'd have you be ♫

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:37.150
♫ And I go north, I get so cold ♫

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:40.150
♫ My heart is lava under stone ♫

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:43.150
♫ You are not worthy ♫

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:46.150
♫ You are not worthy ♫

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:52.150
♫ With your calculating eyes ♫

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:55.150
♫ Spinning figures ♫

00:05:55.150 --> 00:06:01.150
♫ You cannot see me, no ... ♫

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:08.150
♫ And if I tell myself enough, I'll believe it ♫

00:07:27.150 --> 00:07:30.150
(Applause)

00:07:30.150 --> 00:07:33.150
Thank you very much.
