00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.150
We are now going through an amazing and unprecedented moment

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:17.150
where the power dynamics between men and women

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:20.150
are shifting very rapidly,

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:22.150
and in many of the places where it counts the most,

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:25.150
women are, in fact, taking control of everything.

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:27.150
In my mother's day, she didn't go to college.

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.150
Not a lot of women did.

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:32.150
And now, for every two men who get a college degree,

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:34.150
three women will do the same.

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:36.150
Women, for the first time this year,

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:38.150
became the majority of the American workforce.

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:41.150
And they're starting to dominate lots of professions --

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:43.150
doctors, lawyers,

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:45.150
bankers, accountants.

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:48.150
Over 50 percent of managers are women these days,

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:50.150
and in the 15 professions

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:52.150
projected to grow the most in the next decade,

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:54.150
all but two of them are dominated by women.

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:56.150
So the global economy is becoming a place

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:58.150
where women are more successful than men,

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:00.150
believe it or not,

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:02.150
and these economic changes

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:04.150
are starting to rapidly affect our culture --

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:06.150
what our romantic comedies look like,

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.150
what our marriages look like,

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:10.150
what our dating lives look like,

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:12.150
and our new set of superheroes.

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.150
For a long time, this is the image of American manhood that dominated --

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.150
tough, rugged,

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:19.150
in control of his own environment.

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:21.150
A few years ago, the Marlboro Man was retired

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.150
and replaced by this

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:25.150
much less impressive specimen,

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:27.150
who is a parody of American manhood,

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:30.150
and that's what we have in our commercials today.

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.150
The phrase "first-born son"

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:35.150
is so deeply ingrained in our consciousness

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:37.150
that this statistic alone shocked me.

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:39.150
In American fertility clinics,

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.150
75 percent of couples

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:43.150
are requesting girls and not boys.

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:45.150
And in places where you wouldn't think,

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:48.150
such as South Korea, India and China,

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:50.150
the very strict patriarchal societies

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:52.150
are starting to break down a little,

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:54.150
and families are no longer

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:57.150
strongly preferring first-born sons.

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:00.150
If you think about this, if you just open your eyes to this possibility

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:02.150
and start to connect the dots,

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:04.150
you can see the evidence everywhere.

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:06.150
You can see it in college graduation patterns,

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:08.150
in job projections,

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:10.150
in our marriage statistics,

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:13.150
you can see it in the Icelandic elections, which you'll hear about later,

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:16.150
and you can see it on South Korean surveys on son preference,

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:18.150
that something amazing and unprecedented

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:20.150
is happening with women.

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:23.150
Certainly this is not the first time that we've had great progress with women.

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:26.150
The '20s and the '60s also come to mind.

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:28.150
But the difference is that, back then,

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:31.150
it was driven by a very passionate feminist movement

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:33.150
that was trying to project its own desires,

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:35.150
whereas this time, it's not about passion,

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:37.150
and it's not about any kind of movement.

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:39.150
This is really just about the facts

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:41.150
of this economic moment that we live in.

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:43.150
The 200,000-year period

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:45.150
in which men have been top dog

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:48.150
is truly coming to an end, believe it or not,

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:51.150
and that's why I talk about the "end of men."

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:53.150
Now all you men out there,

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:56.150
this is not the moment where you tune out or throw some tomatoes,

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:58.150
because the point is that this

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:00.150
is happening to all of us.

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:03.150
I myself have a husband and a father

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:05.150
and two sons whom I dearly love.

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:07.150
And this is why I like to talk about this,

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:09.150
because if we don't acknowledge it,

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:11.150
then the transition will be pretty painful.

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:13.150
But if we do take account of it,

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:15.150
then I think it will go much more smoothly.

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:19.150
I first started thinking about this about a year and a half ago.

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:22.150
I was reading headlines about the recession just like anyone else,

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:24.150
and I started to notice a distinct pattern --

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:27.150
that the recession was affecting men

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:29.150
much more deeply than it was affecting women.

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:31.150
And I remembered back to about 10 years ago

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:34.150
when I read a book by Susan Faludi

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:37.150
called "Stiffed: The Betrayal of the American Man,"

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:40.150
in which she described how hard the recession had hit men,

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:42.150
and I started to think about

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:45.150
whether it had gotten worse this time around in this recession.

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:48.150
And I realized that two things were different this time around.

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:50.150
The first was that

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:52.150
these were no longer just temporary hits

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:54.150
that the recession was giving men --

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:56.150
that this was reflecting a deeper

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:58.150
underlying shift in our global economy.

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:00.150
And second, that the story was no longer

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:02.150
just about the crisis of men,

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:04.150
but it was also about what was happening to women.

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:06.150
And now look at this second set of slides.

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:09.150
These are headlines about what's been going on with women in the next few years.

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:12.150
These are things we never could have imagined a few years ago.

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:14.150
Women, a majority of the workplace.

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:17.150
And labor statistics: women take up most managerial jobs.

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:19.150
This second set of headlines --

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:22.150
you can see that families and marriages are starting to shift.

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:24.150
And look at that last headline --

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:26.150
young women earning more than young men.

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:29.150
That particular headline comes to me from a market research firm.

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:32.150
They were basically asked by one of their clients

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:35.150
who was going to buy houses in that neighborhood in the future.

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:37.150
And they expected that it would be young families,

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:39.150
or young men, just like it had always been.

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:41.150
But in fact, they found something very surprising.

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:43.150
It was young, single women

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:46.150
who were the major purchasers of houses in the neighborhood.

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:49.150
And so they decided, because they were intrigued by this finding,

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:51.150
to do a nationwide survey.

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:53.150
So they spread out all the census data,

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:56.150
and what they found, the guy described to me as a shocker,

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:59.150
which is that in 1,997

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:01.150
out of 2,000 communities,

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:03.150
women, young women,

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:05.150
were making more money than young men.

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:07.150
So here you have a generation of young women

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:09.150
who grow up thinking of themselves

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:11.150
as being more powerful earners

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:13.150
than the young men around them.

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:16.150
Now, I've just laid out the picture for you,

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:19.150
but I still haven't explained to you why this is happening.

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:21.150
And in a moment, I'm going to show you a graph,

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:23.150
and what you'll see on this graph --

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:25.150
it begins in 1973,

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:27.150
just before women start flooding the workforce,

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:30.150
and it brings us up to our current day.

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:32.150
And basically what you'll see

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:34.150
is what economists talk about

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:36.150
as the polarization of the economy.

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:38.150
Now what does that mean?

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:41.150
It means that the economy is dividing into high-skill, high-wage jobs

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:43.150
and low-skill, low-wage jobs --

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:46.150
and that the middle, the middle-skill jobs,

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:49.150
and the middle-earning jobs, are starting to drop out of the economy.

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:51.150
This has been going on for 40 years now.

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:53.150
But this process is affecting men

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:55.150
very differently than it's affecting women.

00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:58.150
You'll see the women in red, and you'll see the men in blue.

00:05:58.150 --> 00:06:01.150
You'll watch them both drop out of the middle class,

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:03.150
but see what happens to women and see what happens to men.

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:07.150
There we go.

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:10.150
So watch that. You see them both drop out of the middle class.

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:13.150
Watch what happens to the women. Watch what happens to the men.

00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:15.150
The men sort of stagnate there,

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:17.150
while the women zoom up in those high-skill jobs.

00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:19.150
So what's that about?

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:22.150
It looks like women got some power boost on a video game,

00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:25.150
or like they snuck in some secret serum into their birth-control pills

00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:27.150
that lets them shoot up high.

00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:29.150
But of course, it's not about that.

00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:32.150
What it's about is that the economy has changed a lot.

00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:34.150
We used to have a manufacturing economy,

00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:36.150
which was about building goods and products,

00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:39.150
and now we have a service economy

00:06:39.150 --> 00:06:41.150
and an information and creative economy.

00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:44.150
Those two economies require very different skills,

00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:46.150
and as it happens, women have been much better

00:06:46.150 --> 00:06:49.150
at acquiring the new set of skills than men have been.

00:06:49.150 --> 00:06:51.150
It used to be that you were

00:06:51.150 --> 00:06:53.150
a guy who went to high school

00:06:53.150 --> 00:06:55.150
who didn't have a college degree,

00:06:55.150 --> 00:06:57.150
but you had a specific set of skills,

00:06:57.150 --> 00:06:59.150
and with the help of a union,

00:06:59.150 --> 00:07:01.150
you could make yourself a pretty good middle-class life.

00:07:01.150 --> 00:07:03.150
But that really isn't true anymore.

00:07:03.150 --> 00:07:05.150
This new economy is pretty indifferent

00:07:05.150 --> 00:07:07.150
to size and strength,

00:07:07.150 --> 00:07:09.150
which is what's helped men along all these years.

00:07:09.150 --> 00:07:11.150
What the economy requires now

00:07:11.150 --> 00:07:13.150
is a whole different set of skills.

00:07:13.150 --> 00:07:15.150
You basically need intelligence,

00:07:15.150 --> 00:07:18.150
you need an ability to sit still and focus,

00:07:18.150 --> 00:07:20.150
to communicate openly,

00:07:20.150 --> 00:07:22.150
to be able to listen to people

00:07:22.150 --> 00:07:25.150
and to operate in a workplace that is much more fluid than it used to be,

00:07:25.150 --> 00:07:27.150
and those are things that women do extremely well,

00:07:27.150 --> 00:07:29.150
as we're seeing.

00:07:29.150 --> 00:07:31.150
If you look at management theory these days,

00:07:31.150 --> 00:07:33.150
it used to be that our ideal leader

00:07:33.150 --> 00:07:35.150
sounded something like General Patton, right?

00:07:35.150 --> 00:07:37.150
You would be issuing orders from above.

00:07:37.150 --> 00:07:39.150
You would be very hierarchical.

00:07:39.150 --> 00:07:41.150
You would tell everyone below you what to do.

00:07:41.150 --> 00:07:43.150
But that's not what an ideal leader is like now.

00:07:43.150 --> 00:07:45.150
If you read management books now,

00:07:45.150 --> 00:07:48.150
a leader is somebody who can foster creativity,

00:07:48.150 --> 00:07:51.150
who can get his -- get the employees -- see, I still say "his" --

00:07:51.150 --> 00:07:53.150
who can get the employees to talk to each other,

00:07:53.150 --> 00:07:56.150
who can basically build teams and get them to be creative.

00:07:56.150 --> 00:07:59.150
And those are all things that women do very well.

00:07:59.150 --> 00:08:02.150
And then on top of that, that's created a kind of cascading effect.

00:08:02.150 --> 00:08:04.150
Women enter the workplace at the top,

00:08:04.150 --> 00:08:06.150
and then at the working class,

00:08:06.150 --> 00:08:08.150
all the new jobs that are created

00:08:08.150 --> 00:08:11.150
are the kinds of jobs that wives used to do for free at home.

00:08:11.150 --> 00:08:13.150
So that's childcare,

00:08:13.150 --> 00:08:15.150
elder care and food preparation.

00:08:15.150 --> 00:08:17.150
So those are all the jobs that are growing,

00:08:17.150 --> 00:08:19.150
and those are jobs that women tend to do.

00:08:19.150 --> 00:08:21.150
Now one day it might be

00:08:21.150 --> 00:08:24.150
that mothers will hire an out-of-work,

00:08:24.150 --> 00:08:26.150
middle-aged, former steelworker guy

00:08:26.150 --> 00:08:28.150
to watch their children at home,

00:08:28.150 --> 00:08:31.150
and that would be good for the men, but that hasn't quite happened yet.

00:08:31.150 --> 00:08:34.150
To see what's going to happen, you can't just look at the workforce that is now,

00:08:34.150 --> 00:08:37.150
you have to look at our future workforce.

00:08:37.150 --> 00:08:40.150
And here the story is fairly simple.

00:08:40.150 --> 00:08:42.150
Women are getting college degrees

00:08:42.150 --> 00:08:44.150
at a faster rate than men.

00:08:44.150 --> 00:08:46.150
Why? This is a real mystery.

00:08:46.150 --> 00:08:49.150
People have asked men, why don't they just go back to college,

00:08:49.150 --> 00:08:51.150
to community college, say, and retool themselves,

00:08:51.150 --> 00:08:53.150
learn a new set of skills?

00:08:53.150 --> 00:08:56.150
Well it turns out that they're just very uncomfortable doing that.

00:08:56.150 --> 00:08:58.150
They're used to thinking of themselves as providers,

00:08:58.150 --> 00:09:00.150
and they can't seem to build the social networks

00:09:00.150 --> 00:09:02.150
that allow them to get through college.

00:09:02.150 --> 00:09:04.150
So for some reason

00:09:04.150 --> 00:09:06.150
men just don't end up going back to college.

00:09:06.150 --> 00:09:08.150
And what's even more disturbing

00:09:08.150 --> 00:09:10.150
is what's happening with younger boys.

00:09:10.150 --> 00:09:12.150
There's been about a decade of research

00:09:12.150 --> 00:09:14.150
about what people are calling the "boy crisis."

00:09:14.150 --> 00:09:16.150
Now the boy crisis is this idea

00:09:16.150 --> 00:09:19.150
that very young boys, for whatever reason,

00:09:19.150 --> 00:09:22.150
are doing worse in school than very young girls,

00:09:22.150 --> 00:09:24.150
and people have theories about that.

00:09:24.150 --> 00:09:26.150
Is it because we have an excessively verbal curriculum,

00:09:26.150 --> 00:09:28.150
and little girls are better at that than little boys?

00:09:28.150 --> 00:09:31.150
Or that we require kids to sit still too much,

00:09:31.150 --> 00:09:33.150
and so boys initially feel like failures?

00:09:33.150 --> 00:09:35.150
And some people say it's because,

00:09:35.150 --> 00:09:37.150
in 9th grade, boys start dropping out of school.

00:09:37.150 --> 00:09:40.150
Because I'm writing a book about all this, I'm still looking into it,

00:09:40.150 --> 00:09:42.150
so I don't have the answer.

00:09:42.150 --> 00:09:45.150
But in the mean time, I'm going to call on the worldwide education expert,

00:09:45.150 --> 00:09:47.150
who's my 10-year-old daughter, Noa,

00:09:47.150 --> 00:09:49.150
to talk to you about

00:09:49.150 --> 00:09:52.150
why the boys in her class do worse.

00:09:52.150 --> 00:09:54.150
(Video) Noa: The girls are obviously smarter.

00:09:54.150 --> 00:09:57.150
I mean they have much larger vocabulary.

00:09:57.150 --> 00:09:59.150
They learn much faster.

00:09:59.150 --> 00:10:01.150
They are more controlled.

00:10:01.150 --> 00:10:04.150
On the board today for losing recess tomorrow, only boys.

00:10:04.150 --> 00:10:06.150
Hanna Rosin: And why is that?

00:10:06.150 --> 00:10:08.150
Noa: Why? They were just not listening to the class

00:10:08.150 --> 00:10:10.150
while the girls sat there very nicely.

00:10:10.150 --> 00:10:12.150
HR: So there you go.

00:10:12.150 --> 00:10:14.150
This whole thesis really came home to me

00:10:14.150 --> 00:10:17.150
when I went to visit a college in Kansas City --

00:10:17.150 --> 00:10:19.150
working-class college.

00:10:19.150 --> 00:10:22.150
Certainly, when I was in college, I had certain expectations about my life --

00:10:22.150 --> 00:10:25.150
that my husband and I would both work,

00:10:25.150 --> 00:10:27.150
and that we would equally raise the children.

00:10:27.150 --> 00:10:29.150
But these college girls

00:10:29.150 --> 00:10:31.150
had a completely different view of their future.

00:10:31.150 --> 00:10:34.150
Basically, the way they said it to me is

00:10:34.150 --> 00:10:36.150
that they would be working 18 hours a day,

00:10:36.150 --> 00:10:38.150
that their husband would maybe have a job,

00:10:38.150 --> 00:10:41.150
but that mostly he would be at home taking care of the kiddies.

00:10:41.150 --> 00:10:43.150
And this was kind of a shocker to me.

00:10:43.150 --> 00:10:45.150
And then here's my favorite quote from one of the girls:

00:10:45.150 --> 00:10:48.150
"Men are the new ball and chain."

00:10:48.150 --> 00:10:51.150
(Laughter)

00:10:51.150 --> 00:10:53.150
Now you laugh,

00:10:53.150 --> 00:10:55.150
but that quote has kind of a sting to it, right?

00:10:55.150 --> 00:10:57.150
And I think the reason it has a sting

00:10:57.150 --> 00:10:59.150
is because thousands of years of history

00:10:59.150 --> 00:11:01.150
don't reverse themselves

00:11:01.150 --> 00:11:03.150
without a lot of pain,

00:11:03.150 --> 00:11:05.150
and that's why I talk about

00:11:05.150 --> 00:11:07.150
us all going through this together.

00:11:08.150 --> 00:11:10.150
The night after I talked to these college girls,

00:11:10.150 --> 00:11:12.150
I also went to a men's group in Kansas,

00:11:12.150 --> 00:11:15.150
and these were exactly the kind of victims of the manufacturing economy

00:11:15.150 --> 00:11:17.150
which I spoke to you about earlier.

00:11:17.150 --> 00:11:19.150
They were men who had been contractors,

00:11:19.150 --> 00:11:21.150
or they had been building houses

00:11:21.150 --> 00:11:23.150
and they had lost their jobs after the housing boom,

00:11:23.150 --> 00:11:26.150
and they were in this group because they were failing to pay their child support.

00:11:26.150 --> 00:11:28.150
And the instructor was up there in the class

00:11:28.150 --> 00:11:30.150
explaining to them all the ways

00:11:30.150 --> 00:11:33.150
in which they had lost their identity in this new age.

00:11:33.150 --> 00:11:36.150
He was telling them they no longer had any moral authority,

00:11:36.150 --> 00:11:38.150
that nobody needed them for emotional support anymore,

00:11:38.150 --> 00:11:40.150
and they were not really the providers.

00:11:40.150 --> 00:11:42.150
So who were they?

00:11:42.150 --> 00:11:44.150
And this was very disheartening for them.

00:11:44.150 --> 00:11:46.150
And what he did was he wrote down on the board

00:11:46.150 --> 00:11:48.150
"$85,000,"

00:11:48.150 --> 00:11:50.150
and he said, "That's her salary,"

00:11:50.150 --> 00:11:53.150
and then he wrote down "$12,000."

00:11:53.150 --> 00:11:55.150
"That's your salary.

00:11:55.150 --> 00:11:57.150
So who's the man now?" he asked them.

00:11:57.150 --> 00:11:59.150
"Who's the damn man?

00:11:59.150 --> 00:12:01.150
She's the man now."

00:12:01.150 --> 00:12:03.150
And that really sent a shudder through the room.

00:12:03.150 --> 00:12:05.150
And that's part of the reason I like to talk about this,

00:12:05.150 --> 00:12:07.150
because I think it can be pretty painful,

00:12:07.150 --> 00:12:09.150
and we really have to work through it.

00:12:09.150 --> 00:12:11.150
And the other reason it's kind of urgent

00:12:11.150 --> 00:12:13.150
is because it's not just happening in the U.S.

00:12:13.150 --> 00:12:15.150
It's happening all over the world.

00:12:15.150 --> 00:12:17.150
In India, poor women are learning English

00:12:17.150 --> 00:12:19.150
faster than their male counterparts

00:12:19.150 --> 00:12:21.150
in order to staff the new call centers

00:12:21.150 --> 00:12:23.150
that are growing in India.

00:12:23.150 --> 00:12:26.150
In China, a lot of the opening up of private entrepreneurship

00:12:26.150 --> 00:12:28.150
is happening because women are starting businesses,

00:12:28.150 --> 00:12:30.150
small businesses, faster than men.

00:12:30.150 --> 00:12:33.150
And here's my favorite example, which is in South Korea.

00:12:33.150 --> 00:12:35.150
Over several decades,

00:12:35.150 --> 00:12:38.150
South Korea built one of the most patriarchal societies we know about.

00:12:38.150 --> 00:12:42.150
They basically enshrined the second-class status of women

00:12:42.150 --> 00:12:44.150
in the civil code.

00:12:44.150 --> 00:12:46.150
And if women failed to birth male children,

00:12:46.150 --> 00:12:49.150
they were basically treated like domestic servants.

00:12:49.150 --> 00:12:52.150
And sometimes family would pray to the spirits to kill off a girl child

00:12:52.150 --> 00:12:54.150
so they could have a male child.

00:12:54.150 --> 00:12:56.150
But over the '70s and '80s,

00:12:56.150 --> 00:12:59.150
the South Korea government decided they wanted to rapidly industrialize,

00:12:59.150 --> 00:13:01.150
and so what they did was,

00:13:01.150 --> 00:13:03.150
they started to push women into the workforce.

00:13:03.150 --> 00:13:06.150
Now they've been asking a question since 1985:

00:13:06.150 --> 00:13:08.150
"How strongly do you prefer a first-born son?"

00:13:08.150 --> 00:13:10.150
And now look at the chart.

00:13:10.150 --> 00:13:13.150
That's from 1985 to 2003.

00:13:13.150 --> 00:13:15.150
How much do you prefer a first-born son?

00:13:15.150 --> 00:13:17.150
So you can see that these economic changes

00:13:17.150 --> 00:13:20.150
really do have a strong effect on our culture.

00:13:20.150 --> 00:13:23.150
Now because we haven't fully processed this information,

00:13:23.150 --> 00:13:25.150
it's kind of coming back to us in our pop culture

00:13:25.150 --> 00:13:28.150
in these kind of weird and exaggerated ways,

00:13:28.150 --> 00:13:31.150
where you can see that the stereotypes are changing.

00:13:31.150 --> 00:13:33.150
And so we have on the male side

00:13:33.150 --> 00:13:36.150
what one of my colleagues likes to call the "omega males" popping up,

00:13:36.150 --> 00:13:38.150
who are the males who are romantically challenged losers

00:13:38.150 --> 00:13:40.150
who can't find a job.

00:13:40.150 --> 00:13:43.150
And they come up in lots of different forms.

00:13:43.150 --> 00:13:46.150
So we have the perpetual adolescent.

00:13:46.150 --> 00:13:49.150
We have the charmless misanthrope.

00:13:49.150 --> 00:13:51.150
Then we have our Bud Light guy

00:13:51.150 --> 00:13:53.150
who's the happy couch potato.

00:13:53.150 --> 00:13:56.150
And then here's a shocker: even America's most sexiest man alive,

00:13:56.150 --> 00:13:58.150
the sexiest man alive

00:13:58.150 --> 00:14:00.150
gets romantically played these days in a movie.

00:14:00.150 --> 00:14:03.150
And then on the female side, you have the opposite,

00:14:03.150 --> 00:14:06.150
in which you have these crazy superhero women.

00:14:06.150 --> 00:14:09.150
You've got Lady Gaga.

00:14:09.150 --> 00:14:12.150
You've got our new James Bond, who's Angelina Jolie.

00:14:12.150 --> 00:14:15.150
And it's not just for the young, right?

00:14:15.150 --> 00:14:18.150
Even Helen Mirren can hold a gun these days.

00:14:18.150 --> 00:14:21.150
And so it feels like we have to move from this place

00:14:21.150 --> 00:14:24.150
where we've got these uber-exaggerated images

00:14:24.150 --> 00:14:27.150
into something that feels a little more normal.

00:14:27.150 --> 00:14:29.150
So for a long time in the economic sphere,

00:14:29.150 --> 00:14:31.150
we've lived with the term "glass ceiling."

00:14:31.150 --> 00:14:33.150
Now I've never really liked this term.

00:14:33.150 --> 00:14:35.150
For one thing, it puts men and women

00:14:35.150 --> 00:14:38.150
in a really antagonistic relationship with one another,

00:14:38.150 --> 00:14:40.150
because the men are these devious tricksters up there

00:14:40.150 --> 00:14:42.150
who've put up this glass ceiling.

00:14:42.150 --> 00:14:45.150
And we're always below the glass ceiling, the women.

00:14:45.150 --> 00:14:48.150
And we have a lot of skill and experience,

00:14:48.150 --> 00:14:50.150
but it's a trick, so how are you supposed to prepare

00:14:50.150 --> 00:14:52.150
to get through that glass ceiling?

00:14:52.150 --> 00:14:55.150
And also, "shattering the glass ceiling" is a terrible phrase.

00:14:55.150 --> 00:14:57.150
What crazy person

00:14:57.150 --> 00:14:59.150
would pop their head through a glass ceiling?

00:14:59.150 --> 00:15:01.150
So the image that I like to think of,

00:15:01.150 --> 00:15:03.150
instead of glass ceiling,

00:15:03.150 --> 00:15:05.150
is the high bridge.

00:15:05.150 --> 00:15:08.150
It's definitely terrifying to stand at the foot of a high bridge,

00:15:08.150 --> 00:15:10.150
but it's also pretty exhilarating,

00:15:10.150 --> 00:15:12.150
because it's beautiful up there,

00:15:12.150 --> 00:15:15.150
and you're looking out on a beautiful view.

00:15:15.150 --> 00:15:18.150
And the great thing is there's no trick like with the glass ceiling.

00:15:18.150 --> 00:15:20.150
There's no man or woman standing in the middle

00:15:20.150 --> 00:15:22.150
about to cut the cables.

00:15:22.150 --> 00:15:24.150
There's no hole in the middle that you're going to fall through.

00:15:24.150 --> 00:15:27.150
And the great thing is that you can take anyone along with you.

00:15:27.150 --> 00:15:29.150
You can bring your husband along.

00:15:29.150 --> 00:15:31.150
You can bring your friends, or your colleagues,

00:15:31.150 --> 00:15:33.150
or your babysitter to walk along with you.

00:15:33.150 --> 00:15:36.150
And husbands can drag their wives across, if their wives don't feel ready.

00:15:36.150 --> 00:15:38.150
But the point about the high bridge

00:15:38.150 --> 00:15:40.150
is that you have to have the confidence

00:15:40.150 --> 00:15:42.150
to know that you deserve to be on that bridge,

00:15:42.150 --> 00:15:45.150
that you have all the skills and experience you need

00:15:45.150 --> 00:15:48.150
in order to walk across the high bridge,

00:15:48.150 --> 00:15:50.150
but you just have to make the decision

00:15:50.150 --> 00:15:52.150
