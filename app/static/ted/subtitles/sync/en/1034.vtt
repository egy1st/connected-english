00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.150
I have been teaching for a long time,

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:17.150
and in doing so

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:20.150
have acquired a body of knowledge about kids and learning

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:23.150
that I really wish more people would understand

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:26.150
about the potential of students.

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:28.150
In 1931, my grandmother --

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:30.150
bottom left for you guys over here --

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.150
graduated from the eighth grade.

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:34.150
She went to school to get the information

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:36.150
because that's where the information lived.

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:38.150
It was in the books; it was inside the teacher's head;

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:41.150
and she needed to go there to get the information,

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:43.150
because that's how you learned.

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:45.150
Fast-forward a generation:

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:47.150
this is the one-room schoolhouse, Oak Grove,

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:49.150
where my father went to a one-room schoolhouse.

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:51.150
And he again had to travel to the school

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:53.150
to get the information from the teacher,

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:56.150
stored it in the only portable memory he has, which is inside his own head,

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:58.150
and take it with him,

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:01.150
because that is how information was being transported

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:04.150
from teacher to student and then used in the world.

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:06.150
When I was a kid,

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.150
we had a set of encyclopedias at my house.

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:10.150
It was purchased the year I was born,

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:12.150
and it was extraordinary,

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.150
because I did not have to wait to go to the library to get to the information.

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.150
The information was inside my house

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:19.150
and it was awesome.

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:21.150
This was different

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.150
than either generation had experienced before,

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:25.150
and it changed the way I interacted with information

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:27.150
even at just a small level.

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.150
But the information was closer to me.

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:31.150
I could get access to it.

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:33.150
In the time that passes

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.150
between when I was a kid in high school

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:37.150
and when I started teaching,

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:39.150
we really see the advent of the Internet.

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.150
Right about the time that the Internet gets going

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:43.150
as an educational tool,

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:45.150
I take off from Wisconsin

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:47.150
and move to Kansas, small town Kansas,

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:49.150
where I had an opportunity to teach

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:51.150
in a lovely, small-town,

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:53.150
rural Kansas school district,

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:55.150
where I was teaching my favorite subject,

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:57.150
American government.

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:00.150
My first year -- super gung-ho -- going to teach American government,

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:02.150
loved the political system.

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:04.150
Kids in the 12th grade:

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:06.150
not exactly all that enthusiastic

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:08.150
about the American government system.

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:11.150
Year two: learned a few things -- had to change my tactic.

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:13.150
And I put in front of them an authentic experience

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:16.150
that allowed them to learn for themselves.

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:18.150
I didn't tell them what to do or how to do it.

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:20.150
I posed a problem in front of them,

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:23.150
which was to put on an election forum for their own community.

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:26.150
They produced flyers. They called offices.

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:28.150
They checked schedules. They were meeting with secretaries.

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:30.150
They produced an election forum booklet

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:32.150
for the entire town to learn more about their candidates.

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:34.150
They invited everyone into the school

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:36.150
for an evening of conversation

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:38.150
about government and politics

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:40.150
and whether or not the streets were done well,

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:43.150
and really had this robust experiential learning.

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:45.150
The older teachers -- more experienced --

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:47.150
looked at me and went,

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:50.150
"Oh, there she is. That's so cute. She's trying to get that done."

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:52.150
(Laughter)

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:54.150
"She doesn't know what she's in for."

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:56.150
But I knew that the kids would show up,

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:58.150
and I believed it,

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:01.150
and I told them every week what I expected out of them.

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:03.150
And that night, all 90 kids --

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:06.150
dressed appropriately, doing their job, owning it.

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:08.150
I had to just sit and watch.

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:10.150
It was theirs. It was experiential. It was authentic.

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:12.150
It meant something to them.

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:14.150
And they will step up.

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:17.150
From Kansas, I moved on to lovely Arizona,

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:20.150
where I taught in Flagstaff for a number of years,

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:22.150
this time with middle school students.

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:24.150
Luckily, I didn't have to teach them American government.

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:27.150
Could teach them the more exciting topic of geography.

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:30.150
Again, "thrilled" to learn.

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:33.150
But what was interesting

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:36.150
about this position I found myself in in Arizona,

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:38.150
was I had this really

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:40.150
extraordinarily eclectic group of kids to work with

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:42.150
in a truly public school,

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:45.150
and we got to have these moments where we would get these opportunities.

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:47.150
And one opportunity

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:50.150
was we got to go and meet Paul Rusesabagina,

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:52.150
which is the gentleman

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:54.150
that the movie "Hotel Rwanda" is based after.

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:56.150
And he was going to speak at the high school next door to us.

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:58.150
We could walk there. We didn't even have to pay for the buses.

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:01.150
There was no expense cost. Perfect field trip.

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:03.150
The problem then becomes

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:05.150
how do you take seventh- and eighth-graders to a talk about genocide

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:07.150
and deal with the subject in a way

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:09.150
that is responsible and respectful,

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:11.150
and they know what to do with it.

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:13.150
And so we chose to look at Paul Rusesabagina

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:15.150
as an example of a gentleman

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:19.150
who singularly used his life to do something positive.

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:21.150
I then challenged the kids to identify

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:24.150
someone in their own life, or in their own story, or in their own world,

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:26.150
that they could identify that had done a similar thing.

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:28.150
I asked them to produce a little movie about it.

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:30.150
It's the first time we'd done this.

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:32.150
Nobody really knew how to make these little movies on the computer,

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:35.150
but they were into it. And I asked them to put their own voice over it.

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:41.150
It was the most awesome moment of revelation

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:44.150
that when you ask kids to use their own voice

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:46.150
and ask them to speak for themselves,

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:48.150
what they're willing to share.

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:50.150
The last question of the assignment is:

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:52.150
how do you plan to use your life

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:54.150
to positively impact other people?

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:56.150
The things that kids will say

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:59.150
when you ask them and take the time to listen

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:02.150
is extraordinary.

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:05.150
Fast-forward to Pennsylvania, where I find myself today.

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:07.150
I teach at the Science Leadership Academy,

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:10.150
which is a partnership school between the Franklin Institute

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:12.150
and the school district of Philadelphia.

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:15.150
We are a nine through 12 public school,

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:18.150
but we do school quite differently.

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:20.150
I moved there primarily

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:22.150
to be part of a learning environment

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:24.150
that validated the way that I knew that kids learned,

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:26.150
and that really wanted to investigate

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:28.150
what was possible

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:30.150
when you are willing to let go

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:32.150
of some of the paradigms of the past,

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:35.150
of information scarcity when my grandmother was in school

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:38.150
and when my father was in school and even when I was in school,

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:40.150
and to a moment when we have information surplus.

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:43.150
So what do you do when the information is all around you?

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:45.150
Why do you have kids come to school

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:48.150
if they no longer have to come there to get the information?

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:51.150
In Philadelphia we have a one-to-one laptop program,

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:54.150
so the kids are bringing in laptops with them everyday,

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:57.150
taking them home, getting access to information.

00:05:57.150 --> 00:06:00.150
And here's the thing that you need to get comfortable with

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:02.150
when you've given the tool

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:04.150
to acquire information to students,

00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:06.150
is that you have to be comfortable with this idea

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:08.150
of allowing kids to fail

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:11.150
as part of the learning process.

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:13.150
We deal right now in the educational landscape

00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:15.150
with an infatuation

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:17.150
with the culture of one right answer

00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:20.150
that can be properly bubbled on the average multiple choice test,

00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:22.150
and I am here to share with you:

00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:24.150
it is not learning.

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:27.150
That is the absolute wrong thing to ask,

00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:29.150
to tell kids to never be wrong.

00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:32.150
To ask them to always have the right answer

00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:34.150
doesn't allow them to learn.

00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:36.150
So we did this project,

00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:38.150
and this is one of the artifacts of the project.

00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:40.150
I almost never show them off

00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:42.150
because of the issue of the idea of failure.

00:06:42.150 --> 00:06:44.150
My students produced these info-graphics

00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:47.150
as a result of a unit that we decided to do at the end of the year

00:06:47.150 --> 00:06:49.150
responding to the oil spill.

00:06:49.150 --> 00:06:52.150
I asked them to take the examples that we were seeing

00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:54.150
of the info-graphics that existed

00:06:54.150 --> 00:06:56.150
in a lot of mass media,

00:06:56.150 --> 00:06:59.150
and take a look at what were the interesting components of it,

00:06:59.150 --> 00:07:01.150
and produce one for themselves

00:07:01.150 --> 00:07:03.150
of a different man-made disaster from American history.

00:07:03.150 --> 00:07:05.150
And they had certain criteria to do it.

00:07:05.150 --> 00:07:07.150
They were a little uncomfortable with it,

00:07:07.150 --> 00:07:09.150
because we'd never done this before, and they didn't know exactly how to do it.

00:07:09.150 --> 00:07:11.150
They can talk -- they're very smooth,

00:07:11.150 --> 00:07:13.150
and they can write very, very well,

00:07:13.150 --> 00:07:16.150
but asking them to communicate ideas in a different way

00:07:16.150 --> 00:07:19.150
was a little uncomfortable for them.

00:07:19.150 --> 00:07:22.150
But I gave them the room to just do the thing.

00:07:22.150 --> 00:07:24.150
Go create. Go figure it out.

00:07:24.150 --> 00:07:26.150
Let's see what we can do.

00:07:26.150 --> 00:07:28.150
And the student that persistently

00:07:28.150 --> 00:07:31.150
turns out the best visual product did not disappoint.

00:07:31.150 --> 00:07:33.150
This was done in like two or three days.

00:07:33.150 --> 00:07:36.150
And this is the work of the student that consistently did it.

00:07:36.150 --> 00:07:39.150
And when I sat the students down, I said, "Who's got the best one?"

00:07:39.150 --> 00:07:41.150
And they immediately went, "There it is."

00:07:41.150 --> 00:07:43.150
Didn't read anything. "There it is."

00:07:43.150 --> 00:07:45.150
And I said, "Well what makes it great?"

00:07:45.150 --> 00:07:47.150
And they're like, "Oh, the design's good, and he's using good color.

00:07:47.150 --> 00:07:50.150
And there's some ... " And they went through all that we processed out loud.

00:07:50.150 --> 00:07:52.150
And I said, "Go read it."

00:07:52.150 --> 00:07:55.150
And they're like, "Oh, that one wasn't so awesome."

00:07:55.150 --> 00:07:57.150
And then we went to another one --

00:07:57.150 --> 00:07:59.150
it didn't have great visuals, but it had great information --

00:07:59.150 --> 00:08:02.150
and spent an hour talking about the learning process,

00:08:02.150 --> 00:08:04.150
because it wasn't about whether or not it was perfect,

00:08:04.150 --> 00:08:06.150
or whether or not it was what I could create.

00:08:06.150 --> 00:08:09.150
It asked them to create for themselves,

00:08:09.150 --> 00:08:11.150
and it allowed them to fail,

00:08:11.150 --> 00:08:13.150
process, learn from.

00:08:13.150 --> 00:08:15.150
And when we do another round of this in my class this year,

00:08:15.150 --> 00:08:17.150
they will do better this time,

00:08:17.150 --> 00:08:19.150
because learning

00:08:19.150 --> 00:08:22.150
has to include an amount of failure,

00:08:22.150 --> 00:08:24.150
because failure is instructional

00:08:24.150 --> 00:08:26.150
in the process.

00:08:26.150 --> 00:08:29.150
There are a million pictures

00:08:29.150 --> 00:08:31.150
that I could click through here,

00:08:31.150 --> 00:08:34.150
and had to choose carefully -- this is one of my favorites --

00:08:34.150 --> 00:08:36.150
of students learning,

00:08:36.150 --> 00:08:38.150
of what learning can look like

00:08:38.150 --> 00:08:41.150
in a landscape where we let go of the idea

00:08:41.150 --> 00:08:43.150
that kids have to come to school to get the information,

00:08:43.150 --> 00:08:45.150
but instead, ask them what they can do with it.

00:08:45.150 --> 00:08:47.150
Ask them really interesting questions.

00:08:47.150 --> 00:08:49.150
They will not disappoint.

00:08:49.150 --> 00:08:51.150
Ask them to go to places,

00:08:51.150 --> 00:08:53.150
to see things for themselves,

00:08:53.150 --> 00:08:55.150
to actually experience the learning,

00:08:55.150 --> 00:08:58.150
to play, to inquire.

00:08:58.150 --> 00:09:00.150
This is one of my favorite photos,

00:09:00.150 --> 00:09:02.150
because this was taken on Tuesday,

00:09:02.150 --> 00:09:04.150
when I asked the students to go to the polls.

00:09:04.150 --> 00:09:07.150
This is Robbie, and this was his first day of voting,

00:09:07.150 --> 00:09:09.150
and he wanted to share that with everybody and do that.

00:09:09.150 --> 00:09:11.150
But this is learning too,

00:09:11.150 --> 00:09:14.150
because we asked them to go out into real spaces.

00:09:17.150 --> 00:09:19.150
The main point

00:09:19.150 --> 00:09:22.150
is that, if we continue to look at education

00:09:22.150 --> 00:09:25.150
as if it's about coming to school

00:09:25.150 --> 00:09:27.150
to get the information

00:09:27.150 --> 00:09:29.150
and not about experiential learning,

00:09:29.150 --> 00:09:32.150
empowering student voice and embracing failure,

00:09:32.150 --> 00:09:34.150
we're missing the mark.

00:09:34.150 --> 00:09:36.150
And everything that everybody is talking about today

00:09:36.150 --> 00:09:39.150
isn't possible if we keep having an educational system

00:09:39.150 --> 00:09:42.150
that does not value these qualities,

00:09:42.150 --> 00:09:44.150
because we won't get there with a standardized test,

00:09:44.150 --> 00:09:46.150
and we won't get there with a culture of one right answer.

00:09:46.150 --> 00:09:48.150
We know how to do this better,

00:09:48.150 --> 00:09:50.150
and it's time to do better.

00:09:50.150 --> 00:09:55.150
