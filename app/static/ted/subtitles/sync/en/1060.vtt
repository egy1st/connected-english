00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:14.150
I'm going to be talking to you

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:16.150
about how we can tap

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:18.150
a really underutilized resource in health care,

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:20.150
which is the patient,

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:23.150
or, as I like to use the scientific term,

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:25.150
people.

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:27.150
Because we are all patients, we are all people.

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.150
Even doctors are patients at some point.

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:31.150
So I want to talk about that

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:33.150
as an opportunity

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:36.150
that we really have failed to engage with very well in this country

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:38.150
and, in fact, worldwide.

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:40.150
If you want to get at the big part --

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:43.150
I mean from a public health level, where my training is --

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:45.150
you're looking at behavioral issues.

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:48.150
You're looking at things where people are actually given information,

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:50.150
and they're not following through with it.

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:54.150
It's a problem that manifests itself in diabetes,

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:56.150
obesity, many forms of heart disease,

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:59.150
even some forms of cancer -- when you think of smoking.

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:02.150
Those are all behaviors where people know what they're supposed to do.

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:04.150
They know what they're supposed to be doing,

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:06.150
but they're not doing it.

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.150
Now behavior change is something

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:10.150
that is a long-standing problem in medicine.

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:12.150
It goes all the way back to Aristotle.

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.150
And doctors hate it, right?

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:16.150
I mean, they complain about it all the time.

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:19.150
We talk about it in terms of engagement, or non-compliance.

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:21.150
When people don't take their pills,

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.150
when people don't follow doctors' orders --

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:25.150
these are behavior problems.

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:27.150
But for as much as clinical medicine

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.150
agonizes over behavior change,

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:31.150
there's not a lot of work done

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:34.150
in terms of trying to fix that problem.

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:36.150
So the crux of it

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.150
comes down to this notion of decision-making --

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:40.150
giving information to people in a form

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:42.150
that doesn't just educate them

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.150
or inform them,

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:46.150
but actually leads them to make better decisions,

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:48.150
better choices in their lives.

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:50.150
One part of medicine, though,

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:54.150
has faced the problem of behavior change pretty well,

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:56.150
and that's dentistry.

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:58.150
Dentistry might seem -- and I think it is --

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:00.150
many dentists would have to acknowledge

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:02.150
it's somewhat of a mundane backwater of medicine.

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:05.150
Not a lot of cool, sexy stuff happening in dentistry.

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:08.150
But they have really taken this problem of behavior change

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:10.150
and solved it.

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:12.150
It's the one great preventive health success

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:14.150
we have in our health care system.

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:16.150
People brush and floss their teeth.

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:19.150
They don't do it as much as they should, but they do it.

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:21.150
So I'm going to talk about one experiment

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:23.150
that a few dentists in Connecticut

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:25.150
cooked up about 30 years ago.

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:27.150
So this is an old experiment, but it's a really good one,

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:29.150
because it was very simple,

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:31.150
so it's an easy story to tell.

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:33.150
So these Connecticut dentists decided

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:36.150
that they wanted to get people to brush their teeth and floss their teeth more often,

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:38.150
and they were going to use one variable:

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:40.150
they wanted to scare them.

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:43.150
They wanted to tell them how bad it would be

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:45.150
if they didn't brush and floss their teeth.

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:48.150
They had a big patient population.

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:50.150
They divided them up into two groups.

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:52.150
They had a low-fear population,

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:54.150
where they basically gave them a 13-minute presentation,

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:56.150
all based in science,

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:59.150
but told them that, if you didn't brush and floss your teeth,

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:02.150
you could get gum disease. If you get gum disease, you will lose your teeth,

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:04.150
but you'll get dentures, and it won't be that bad.

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:06.150
So that was the low-fear group.

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:09.150
The high-fear group, they laid it on really thick.

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:11.150
They showed bloody gums.

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:14.150
They showed puss oozing out from between their teeth.

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:16.150
They told them that their teeth were going to fall out.

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:18.150
They said that they could have infections

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:21.150
that would spread from their jaws to other parts of their bodies,

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:23.150
and ultimately, yes, they would lose their teeth.

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:25.150
They would get dentures, and if you got dentures,

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:27.150
you weren't going to be able to eat corn-on-the-cob,

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:29.150
you weren't going to be able to eat apples,

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:31.150
you weren't going to be able to eat steak.

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:33.150
You'll eat mush for the rest of your life.

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:36.150
So go brush and floss your teeth.

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:38.150
That was the message. That was the experiment.

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:40.150
Now they measured one other variable.

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:42.150
They wanted to capture one other variable,

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:45.150
which was the patients' sense of efficacy.

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:47.150
This was the notion of whether the patients felt

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:50.150
that they actually would go ahead and brush and floss their teeth.

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:52.150
So they asked them at the beginning,

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:54.150
"Do you think you'll actually be able to stick with this program?"

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:56.150
And the people who said, "Yeah, yeah. I'm pretty good about that,"

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:58.150
they were characterized as high efficacy,

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:00.150
and the people who said,

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:02.150
"Eh, I never get around to brushing and flossing as much as I should,"

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:04.150
they were characterized as low efficacy.

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:07.150
So the upshot was this.

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:09.150
The upshot of this experiment

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:12.150
was that fear was not really a primary driver

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:14.150
of the behavior at all.

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:16.150
The people who brushed and flossed their teeth

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:18.150
were not necessarily the people

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:20.150
who were really scared about what would happen --

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:23.150
it's the people who simply felt that they had the capacity

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:25.150
to change their behavior.

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:28.150
So fear showed up as not really the driver.

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:31.150
It was the sense of efficacy.

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:33.150
So I want to isolate this,

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:35.150
because it was a great observation --

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:37.150
30 years ago, right, 30 years ago --

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:40.150
and it's one that's laid fallow in research.

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:42.150
It was a notion that really came out

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:44.150
of Albert Bandura's work,

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:46.150
who studied whether

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:49.150
people could get a sense of empowerment.

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:52.150
The notion of efficacy basically boils down to one -- that

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:55.150
if somebody believes that they have the capacity to change their behavior.

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:58.150
In health care terms, you could characterize this

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:00.150
as whether or not somebody feels

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:02.150
that they see a path towards better health,

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:04.150
that they can actually see their way towards getting better health,

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:06.150
and that's a very important notion.

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:08.150
It's an amazing notion.

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:11.150
We don't really know how to manipulate it, though, that well.

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:14.150
Except, maybe we do.

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:16.150
So fear doesn't work, right? Fear doesn't work.

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:18.150
And this is a great example

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:21.150
of how we haven't learned that lesson at all.

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:24.150
This is a campaign from the American Diabetes Association.

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:27.150
This is still the way we're communicating messages about health.

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:30.150
I mean, I showed my three-year-old this slide last night,

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:34.150
and he's like, "Papa, why is an ambulance in these people's homes?"

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:37.150
And I had to explain, "They're trying to scare people."

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:39.150
And I don't know if it works.

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:41.150
Now here's what does work:

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:43.150
personalized information works.

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:45.150
Again, Bandura recognized this

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:47.150
years ago, decades ago.

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:49.150
When you give people specific information

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:51.150
about their health, where they stand,

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:53.150
and where they want to get to, where they might get to,

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:55.150
that path, that notion of a path --

00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:57.150
that tends to work for behavior change.

00:05:57.150 --> 00:05:59.150
So let me just spool it out a little bit.

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:02.150
So you start with personalized data, personalized information

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:04.150
that comes from an individual,

00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:07.150
and then you need to connect it to their lives.

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:09.150
You need to connect it to their lives,

00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:11.150
hopefully not in a fear-based way, but one that they understand.

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:14.150
Okay, I know where I sit. I know where I'm situated.

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:17.150
And that doesn't just work for me in terms of abstract numbers --

00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:19.150
this overload of health information

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:21.150
that we're inundated with.

00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:23.150
But it actually hits home.

00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:25.150
It's not just hitting us in our heads; it's hitting us in our hearts.

00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:27.150
There's an emotional connection to information

00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:29.150
because it's from us.

00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:32.150
That information then needs to be connected to choices,

00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:34.150
needs to be connected to a range of options,

00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:36.150
directions that we might go to --

00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:38.150
trade-offs, benefits.

00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:41.150
Finally, we need to be presented with a clear point of action.

00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:43.150
We need to connect the information

00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:45.150
always with the action,

00:06:45.150 --> 00:06:47.150
and then that action feeds back

00:06:47.150 --> 00:06:49.150
into different information,

00:06:49.150 --> 00:06:51.150
and it creates, of course, a feedback loop.

00:06:51.150 --> 00:06:54.150
Now this is a very well-observed and well-established notion

00:06:54.150 --> 00:06:56.150
for behavior change.

00:06:56.150 --> 00:06:59.150
But the problem is that things -- in the upper-right corner there --

00:06:59.150 --> 00:07:01.150
personalized data, it's been pretty hard to come by.

00:07:01.150 --> 00:07:04.150
It's a difficult and expensive commodity,

00:07:04.150 --> 00:07:06.150
until now.

00:07:06.150 --> 00:07:09.150
So I'm going to give you an example, a very simple example of how this works.

00:07:09.150 --> 00:07:12.150
So we've all seen these. These are the "your speed limit" signs.

00:07:12.150 --> 00:07:14.150
You've seen them all around,

00:07:14.150 --> 00:07:16.150
especially these days as radars are cheaper.

00:07:16.150 --> 00:07:18.150
And here's how they work in the feedback loop.

00:07:18.150 --> 00:07:20.150
So you start with the personalized data

00:07:20.150 --> 00:07:22.150
where the speed limit on the road that you are at that point

00:07:22.150 --> 00:07:24.150
is 25,

00:07:24.150 --> 00:07:26.150
and, of course, you're going faster than that.

00:07:26.150 --> 00:07:29.150
We always are. We're always going above the speed limit.

00:07:29.150 --> 00:07:31.150
The choice in this case is pretty simple.

00:07:31.150 --> 00:07:33.150
We either keep going fast, or we slow down.

00:07:33.150 --> 00:07:35.150
We should probably slow down,

00:07:35.150 --> 00:07:37.150
and that point of action is probably now.

00:07:37.150 --> 00:07:40.150
We should take our foot off the pedal right now,

00:07:40.150 --> 00:07:43.150
and generally we do. These things are shown to be pretty effective

00:07:43.150 --> 00:07:45.150
in terms of getting people to slow down.

00:07:45.150 --> 00:07:47.150
They reduce speeds by about five to 10 percent.

00:07:47.150 --> 00:07:49.150
They last for about five miles,

00:07:49.150 --> 00:07:51.150
in which case we put our foot back on the pedal.

00:07:51.150 --> 00:07:53.150
But it works, and it even has some health repercussions.

00:07:53.150 --> 00:07:55.150
Your blood pressure might drop a little bit.

00:07:55.150 --> 00:07:58.150
Maybe there's fewer accidents, so there's public health benefits.

00:07:58.150 --> 00:08:00.150
But by and large, this is a feedback loop

00:08:00.150 --> 00:08:03.150
that's so nifty and too rare.

00:08:03.150 --> 00:08:05.150
Because in health care, most health care,

00:08:05.150 --> 00:08:08.150
the data is very removed from the action.

00:08:08.150 --> 00:08:11.150
It's very difficult to line things up so neatly.

00:08:11.150 --> 00:08:13.150
But we have an opportunity.

00:08:13.150 --> 00:08:15.150
So I want to talk about, I want to shift now to think about

00:08:15.150 --> 00:08:17.150
how we deliver health information in this country,

00:08:17.150 --> 00:08:20.150
how we actually get information.

00:08:20.150 --> 00:08:23.150
This is a pharmaceutical ad.

00:08:23.150 --> 00:08:25.150
Actually, it's a spoof. It's not a real pharmaceutical ad.

00:08:25.150 --> 00:08:27.150
Nobody's had the brilliant idea

00:08:27.150 --> 00:08:30.150
of calling their drug Havidol quite yet.

00:08:31.150 --> 00:08:33.150
But it looks completely right.

00:08:33.150 --> 00:08:35.150
So it's exactly the way we get

00:08:35.150 --> 00:08:38.150
health information and pharmaceutical information,

00:08:38.150 --> 00:08:40.150
and it just sounds perfect.

00:08:40.150 --> 00:08:42.150
And then we turn the page of the magazine,

00:08:42.150 --> 00:08:45.150
and we see this --

00:08:45.150 --> 00:08:48.150
now this is the page the FDA requires pharmaceutical companies

00:08:48.150 --> 00:08:51.150
to put into their ads, or to follow their ads,

00:08:51.150 --> 00:08:55.150
and to me, this is one of the most 
cynical exercises in medicine.

00:08:55.150 --> 00:08:57.150
Because we know.

00:08:57.150 --> 00:08:59.150
Who among us would actually say that people read this?

00:08:59.150 --> 00:09:01.150
And who among us would actually say

00:09:01.150 --> 00:09:03.150
that people who do try to read this

00:09:03.150 --> 00:09:05.150
actually get anything out of it?

00:09:05.150 --> 00:09:07.150
This is a bankrupt effort

00:09:07.150 --> 00:09:10.150
at communicating health information.

00:09:10.150 --> 00:09:12.150
There is no good faith in this.

00:09:12.150 --> 00:09:14.150
So this is a different approach.

00:09:14.150 --> 00:09:17.150
This is an approach that has been developed

00:09:17.150 --> 00:09:20.150
by a couple researchers at Dartmouth Medical School,

00:09:20.150 --> 00:09:22.150
Lisa Schwartz and Steven Woloshin.

00:09:22.150 --> 00:09:25.150
And they created this thing called the "drug facts box."

00:09:25.150 --> 00:09:27.150
They took inspiration from, of all things,

00:09:27.150 --> 00:09:29.150
Cap'n Crunch.

00:09:29.150 --> 00:09:32.150
They went to the nutritional information box

00:09:32.150 --> 00:09:35.150
and saw that what works for cereal, works for our food,

00:09:35.150 --> 00:09:38.150
actually helps people understand what's in their food.

00:09:39.150 --> 00:09:41.150
God forbid we should use that same standard

00:09:41.150 --> 00:09:43.150
that we make Cap'n Crunch live by

00:09:43.150 --> 00:09:46.150
and bring it to drug companies.

00:09:46.150 --> 00:09:48.150
So let me just walk through this quickly.

00:09:48.150 --> 00:09:51.150
It says very clearly what the drug is for, specifically who it is good for,

00:09:51.150 --> 00:09:53.150
so you can start to personalize your understanding

00:09:53.150 --> 00:09:55.150
of whether the information is relevant to you

00:09:55.150 --> 00:09:57.150
or whether the drug is relevant to you.

00:09:57.150 --> 00:10:00.150
You can understand exactly what the benefits are.

00:10:00.150 --> 00:10:03.150
It isn't this kind of vague promise that it's going to work no matter what,

00:10:03.150 --> 00:10:06.150
but you get the statistics for how effective it is.

00:10:06.150 --> 00:10:09.150
And finally, you understand what those choices are.

00:10:09.150 --> 00:10:11.150
You can start to unpack the choices involved

00:10:11.150 --> 00:10:13.150
because of the side effects.

00:10:13.150 --> 00:10:16.150
Every time you take a drug, you're walking into a possible side effect.

00:10:16.150 --> 00:10:18.150
So it spells those out in very clean terms,

00:10:18.150 --> 00:10:20.150
and that works.

00:10:20.150 --> 00:10:22.150
So I love this. I love that drug facts box.

00:10:22.150 --> 00:10:24.150
And so I was thinking about,

00:10:24.150 --> 00:10:26.150
what's an opportunity that I could have

00:10:26.150 --> 00:10:29.150
to help people understand information?

00:10:29.150 --> 00:10:33.150
What's another latent body of information that's out there

00:10:33.150 --> 00:10:36.150
that people are really not putting to use?

00:10:36.150 --> 00:10:39.150
And so I came up with this: lab test results.

00:10:39.150 --> 00:10:42.150
Blood test results are this great source of information.

00:10:42.150 --> 00:10:44.150
They're packed with information.

00:10:44.150 --> 00:10:47.150
They're just not for us. They're not for people. They're not for patients.

00:10:47.150 --> 00:10:49.150
They go right to doctors.

00:10:49.150 --> 00:10:52.150
And God forbid -- I think many doctors, if you really asked them,

00:10:52.150 --> 00:10:55.150
they don't really understand all this stuff either.

00:10:55.150 --> 00:10:58.150
This is the worst presented information.

00:10:58.150 --> 00:11:01.150
You ask Tufte, and he would say,

00:11:01.150 --> 00:11:04.150
"Yes, this is the absolute worst presentation of information possible."

00:11:04.150 --> 00:11:06.150
What we did at Wired

00:11:06.150 --> 00:11:08.150
was we went, and I got our graphic design department

00:11:08.150 --> 00:11:10.150
to re-imagine these lab reports.

00:11:10.150 --> 00:11:12.150
So that's what I want to walk you through.

00:11:12.150 --> 00:11:15.150
So this is the general blood work before,

00:11:15.150 --> 00:11:17.150
and this is the after, this is what we came up with.

00:11:17.150 --> 00:11:19.150
The after takes what was four pages --

00:11:19.150 --> 00:11:21.150
that previous slide was actually

00:11:21.150 --> 00:11:23.150
the first of four pages of data

00:11:23.150 --> 00:11:25.150
that's just the general blood work.

00:11:25.150 --> 00:11:28.150
It goes on and on and on, all these values, all these numbers you don't know.

00:11:28.150 --> 00:11:31.150
This is our one-page summary.

00:11:31.150 --> 00:11:33.150
We use the notion of color.

00:11:33.150 --> 00:11:36.150
It's an amazing notion that color could be used.

00:11:36.150 --> 00:11:39.150
So on the top-level you have your overall results,

00:11:39.150 --> 00:11:42.150
the things that might jump out at you from the fine print.

00:11:42.150 --> 00:11:44.150
Then you can drill down

00:11:44.150 --> 00:11:47.150
and understand how actually we put your level in context,

00:11:47.150 --> 00:11:49.150
and we use color to illustrate

00:11:49.150 --> 00:11:51.150
exactly where your value falls.

00:11:51.150 --> 00:11:54.150
In this case, this patient is slightly at risk of diabetes

00:11:54.150 --> 00:11:56.150
because of their glucose level.

00:11:56.150 --> 00:11:58.150
Likewise, you can go over your lipids

00:11:58.150 --> 00:12:01.150
and, again, understand what your overall cholesterol level is

00:12:01.150 --> 00:12:04.150
and then break down into the HDL and the LDL if you so choose.

00:12:04.150 --> 00:12:06.150
But again, always using color

00:12:06.150 --> 00:12:08.150
and personalized proximity

00:12:08.150 --> 00:12:10.150
to that information.

00:12:10.150 --> 00:12:12.150
All those other values,

00:12:12.150 --> 00:12:14.150
all those pages and pages of values that are full of nothing,

00:12:14.150 --> 00:12:16.150
we summarize.

00:12:16.150 --> 00:12:18.150
We tell you that you're okay, you're normal.

00:12:18.150 --> 00:12:21.150
But you don't have to wade through it. You don't have to go through the junk.

00:12:21.150 --> 00:12:23.150
And then we do two other very important things

00:12:23.150 --> 00:12:25.150
that kind of help fill in this feedback loop:

00:12:25.150 --> 00:12:27.150
we help people understand in a little more detail

00:12:27.150 --> 00:12:30.150
what these values are and what they might indicate.

00:12:30.150 --> 00:12:33.150
And then we go a further step -- we tell them what they can do.

00:12:33.150 --> 00:12:35.150
We give them some insight

00:12:35.150 --> 00:12:38.150
into what choices they can make, what actions they can take.

00:12:38.150 --> 00:12:41.150
So that's our general blood work test.

00:12:41.150 --> 00:12:43.150
Then we went to CRP test.

00:12:43.150 --> 00:12:45.150
In this case, it's a sin of omission.

00:12:45.150 --> 00:12:47.150
They have this huge amount of space,

00:12:47.150 --> 00:12:49.150
and they don't use it for anything, so we do.

00:12:49.150 --> 00:12:51.150
Now the CRP test is often done

00:12:51.150 --> 00:12:53.150
following a cholesterol test,

00:12:53.150 --> 00:12:55.150
or in conjunction with a cholesterol test.

00:12:55.150 --> 00:12:57.150
So we take the bold step

00:12:57.150 --> 00:13:00.150
of putting the cholesterol information on the same page,

00:13:00.150 --> 00:13:02.150
which is the way the doctor is going to evaluate it.

00:13:02.150 --> 00:13:05.150
So we thought the patient might actually want to know the context as well.

00:13:05.150 --> 00:13:07.150
It's a protein that shows up

00:13:07.150 --> 00:13:09.150
when your blood vessels might be inflamed,

00:13:09.150 --> 00:13:11.150
which might be a risk for heart disease.

00:13:11.150 --> 00:13:13.150
What you're actually measuring

00:13:13.150 --> 00:13:15.150
is spelled out in clean language.

00:13:15.150 --> 00:13:17.150
Then we use the information

00:13:17.150 --> 00:13:19.150
that's already in the lab report.

00:13:19.150 --> 00:13:21.150
We use the person's age and their gender

00:13:21.150 --> 00:13:24.150
to start to fill in the personalized risks.

00:13:24.150 --> 00:13:26.150
So we start to use the data we have

00:13:26.150 --> 00:13:28.150
to run a very simple calculation

00:13:28.150 --> 00:13:30.150
that's on all sorts of online calculators

00:13:30.150 --> 00:13:33.150
to get a sense of what the actual risk is.

00:13:33.150 --> 00:13:35.150
The last one I'll show you is a PSA test.

00:13:35.150 --> 00:13:38.150
Here's the before, and here's the after.

00:13:38.150 --> 00:13:40.150
Now a lot of our effort on this one --

00:13:40.150 --> 00:13:42.150
as many of you probably know,

00:13:42.150 --> 00:13:44.150
a PSA test is a very controversial test.

00:13:44.150 --> 00:13:46.150
It's used to test for prostate cancer,

00:13:46.150 --> 00:13:48.150
but there are all sorts of reasons

00:13:48.150 --> 00:13:50.150
why your prostate might be enlarged.

00:13:50.150 --> 00:13:52.150
And so we spent a good deal of our time

00:13:52.150 --> 00:13:54.150
indicating that.

00:13:54.150 --> 00:13:56.150
We again personalized the risks.

00:13:56.150 --> 00:13:58.150
So this patient is in their 50s,

00:13:58.150 --> 00:14:00.150
so we can actually give them a very precise estimate

00:14:00.150 --> 00:14:02.150
of what their risk for prostate cancer is.

00:14:02.150 --> 00:14:05.150
In this case it's about 25 percent, based on that.

00:14:05.150 --> 00:14:08.150
And then again, the follow-up actions.

00:14:08.150 --> 00:14:11.150
So our cost for this was less than 10,000 dollars, all right.

00:14:11.150 --> 00:14:14.150
That's what Wired magazine spent on this.

00:14:14.150 --> 00:14:16.150
Why is Wired magazine doing this?

00:14:16.150 --> 00:14:19.150
(Laughter)

00:14:19.150 --> 00:14:21.150
Quest Diagnostics and LabCorp,

00:14:21.150 --> 00:14:24.150
the two largest lab testing companies --

00:14:24.150 --> 00:14:27.150
last year, they made profits of over 700 million dollars

00:14:27.150 --> 00:14:30.150
and over 500 million dollars respectively.

00:14:30.150 --> 00:14:32.150
Now this is not a problem of resources;

00:14:32.150 --> 00:14:35.150
this is a problem of incentives.

00:14:35.150 --> 00:14:38.150
We need to recognize that the target of this information

00:14:38.150 --> 00:14:41.150
should not be the doctor, should not be the insurance company.

00:14:41.150 --> 00:14:43.150
It should be the patient.

00:14:43.150 --> 00:14:45.150
It's the person who actually, in the end,

00:14:45.150 --> 00:14:47.150
is going to be having to change their lives

00:14:47.150 --> 00:14:49.150
and then start adopting new behaviors.

00:14:49.150 --> 00:14:51.150
This is information that is incredibly powerful.

00:14:51.150 --> 00:14:54.150
It's an incredibly powerful catalyst to change.

00:14:54.150 --> 00:14:56.150
But we're not using it. It's just sitting there.

00:14:56.150 --> 00:14:58.150
It's being lost.

00:14:58.150 --> 00:15:00.150
So I want to just offer four questions

00:15:00.150 --> 00:15:02.150
that every patient should ask,

00:15:02.150 --> 00:15:04.150
because I don't actually expect people

00:15:04.150 --> 00:15:06.150
to start developing these lab test reports.

00:15:06.150 --> 00:15:08.150
But you can create your own feedback loop.

00:15:08.150 --> 00:15:11.150
Anybody can create their feedback loop by asking these simple questions:

00:15:11.150 --> 00:15:13.150
Can I have my results?

00:15:13.150 --> 00:15:15.150
And the only acceptable answer is --

00:15:15.150 --> 00:15:17.150
(Audience: Yes.) -- yes.

00:15:17.150 --> 00:15:19.150
What does this mean? Help me understand what the data is.

00:15:19.150 --> 00:15:22.150
What are my options? What choices are now on the table?

00:15:22.150 --> 00:15:24.150
And then, what's next?

00:15:24.150 --> 00:15:26.150
How do I integrate this information

00:15:26.150 --> 00:15:28.150
into the longer course of my life?

00:15:29.150 --> 00:15:31.150
So I want to wind up by just showing

00:15:31.150 --> 00:15:33.150
that people have the capacity to understand this information.

00:15:33.150 --> 00:15:36.150
This is not beyond the grasp of ordinary people.

00:15:36.150 --> 00:15:39.150
You do not need to have the education level of people in this room.

00:15:39.150 --> 00:15:42.150
Ordinary people are capable of understanding this information,

00:15:42.150 --> 00:15:45.150
if we only go to the effort of presenting it to them

00:15:45.150 --> 00:15:47.150
in a form that they can engage with.

00:15:47.150 --> 00:15:49.150
And engagement is essential here,

00:15:49.150 --> 00:15:51.150
because it's not just giving them information;

00:15:51.150 --> 00:15:53.150
it's giving them an opportunity to act.

00:15:53.150 --> 00:15:55.150
That's what engagement is. It's different from compliance.

00:15:55.150 --> 00:15:58.150
It works totally different from the way we talk about behavior

00:15:58.150 --> 00:16:00.150
in medicine today.

00:16:00.150 --> 00:16:02.150
And this information is out there.

00:16:02.150 --> 00:16:04.150
I've been talking today about latent information,

00:16:04.150 --> 00:16:06.150
all this information that exists in the system

00:16:06.150 --> 00:16:08.150
that we're not putting to use.

00:16:08.150 --> 00:16:10.150
But there are all sorts of other bodies of information

00:16:10.150 --> 00:16:12.150
that are coming online,

00:16:12.150 --> 00:16:15.150
and we need to recognize the capacity of this information

00:16:15.150 --> 00:16:17.150
to engage people, to help people

00:16:17.150 --> 00:16:19.150
and to change the course of their lives.

00:16:19.150 --> 00:16:21.150
Thank you very much.

00:16:21.150 --> 00:16:24.150
