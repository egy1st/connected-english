00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.150
Two weeks ago I was in my studio in Paris,

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:17.150
and the phone rang and I heard,

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:19.150
"Hey, JR,

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:21.150
you won the TED Prize 2011.

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.150
You have to make a wish to save the world."

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.150
I was lost.

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:29.150
I mean, I can't save the world. Nobody can.

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:31.150
The world is fucked up.

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:33.150
Come on, you have dictators ruling the world,

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:35.150
population is growing by millions,

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:37.150
there's no more fish in the sea,

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:39.150
the North Pole is melting

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:41.150
and as the last TED Prize winner said,

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:43.150
we're all becoming fat.

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:45.150
(Laughter)

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:47.150
Except maybe French people.

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:49.150
Whatever.

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:51.150
So I called back

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:53.150
and I told her,

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:55.150
"Look, Amy,

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:57.150
tell the TED guys I just won't show up.

00:00:57.150 --> 00:00:59.150
I can't do anything to save the world."

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:01.150
She said, "Hey, JR,

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:04.150
your wish is not to save the world, but to change the world."

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:06.150
"Oh, all right."

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.150
(Laughter)

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:10.150
"That's cool."

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:13.150
I mean, technology, politics, business

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:15.150
do change the world --

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.150
not always in a good way, but they do.

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:19.150
What about art?

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:22.150
Could art change the world?

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:25.150
I started when I was 15 years old.

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:28.150
And at that time, I was not thinking about changing the world.

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:30.150
I was doing graffiti --

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.150
writing my name everywhere,

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:35.150
using the city as a canvas.

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.150
I was going in the tunnels of Paris,

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:41.150
on the rooftops with my friends.

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:43.150
Each trip was an excursion,

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:45.150
was an adventure.

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:47.150
It was like leaving our mark on society,

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:50.150
to say, "I was here," on the top of a building.

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:54.150
So when I found a cheap camera on the subway,

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:58.150
I started documenting those adventures with my friends

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:01.150
and gave them back as photocopies --

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:04.150
really small photos just that size.

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:11.150
That's how, at 17 years old,

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:13.150
I started pasting them.

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:15.150
And I did my first "expo de rue,"

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:17.150
which means sidewalk gallery.

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:20.150
And I framed it with color

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:23.150
so you would not confuse it with advertising.

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:28.150
I mean, the city's the best gallery I could imagine.

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:31.150
I would never have to make a book and then present it to a gallery

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:33.150
and let them decide

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:35.150
if my work was nice enough to show it to people.

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:38.150
I would control it directly with the public

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:41.150
in the streets.

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:43.150
So that's Paris.

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:45.150
I would change --

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:47.150
depending on the places I would go --

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:49.150
the title of the exhibition.

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:51.150
That's on the Champs-Elysees.

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:53.150
I was quite proud of that one.

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:55.150
Because I was just 18

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:57.150
and I was just up there on the top of the Champs-Elysees.

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:59.150
Then when the photo left,

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:01.150
the frame was still there.

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:03.150
(Laughter)

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:05.150
November 2005:

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:07.150
the streets are burning.

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:09.150
A large wave of riots

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:12.150
had broken into the first projects of Paris.

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:15.150
Everyone was glued to the TV,

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:19.150
watching disturbing, frightening images

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:22.150
taken from the edge of the neighborhood.

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:26.150
I mean, these kids, without control,

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:28.150
throwing Molotov cocktails,

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:30.150
attacking the cops and the firemen,

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:32.150
looting everything they could in the shops.

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:35.150
These were criminals, thugs, dangerous,

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:38.150
destroying their own environment.

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:41.150
And then I saw it -- could it be possible? --

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:44.150
my photo on a wall

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:47.150
revealed by a burning car --

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:49.150
a pasting I'd done a year earlier --

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:52.150
an illegal one -- still there.

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:54.150
I mean, these were the faces of my friends.

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:56.150
I know those guys.

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:58.150
All of them are not angels,

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:01.150
but they're not monsters either.

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:04.150
So it was kind of weird to see

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:08.150
those images and those eyes stare back at me through a television.

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:10.150
So I went back there

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:13.150
with a 28 mm lens.

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:15.150
It was the only one I had at that time.

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:17.150
But with that lens,

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:20.150
you have to be as close as 10 inches from the person.

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:23.150
So you can do it only with their trust.

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:27.150
So I took full portraits of people from Le Bosquet.

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:29.150
They were making scary faces

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:32.150
to play the caricature of themselves.

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:47.150
And then I pasted huge posters everywhere

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:49.150
in the bourgeois area of Paris

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:52.150
with the name, age, even building number

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:55.150
of these guys.

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:03.150
A year later,

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:06.150
the exhibition was displayed in front of the city hall of Paris.

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:09.150
And we go from thug images,

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:12.150
who've been stolen and distorted by the media,

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:15.150
who's now proudly taking over his own image.

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:17.150
That's where I realized

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:20.150
the power of paper and glue.

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:30.150
So could art change the world?

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:32.150
A year later,

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:34.150
I was listening to all the noise

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:36.150
about the Middle East conflict.

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:38.150
I mean, at that time, trust me,

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:40.150
they were only referring to the Israeli and Palestinian conflict.

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:42.150
So with my friend Marco,

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:44.150
we decided to go there

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:47.150
and see who are the real Palestinians and who are the real Israelis.

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:49.150
Are they so different?

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:52.150
When we got there, we just went in the street,

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:55.150
started talking with people everywhere,

00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:57.150
and we realized that things were a bit different

00:05:57.150 --> 00:06:00.150
from the rhetoric we heard in the media.

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:02.150
So we decided to take portraits

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:04.150
of Palestinians and Israelis

00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:06.150
doing the same jobs --

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:09.150
taxi-driver, lawyer, cooks.

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:13.150
Asked them to make a face as a sign of commitment.

00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:15.150
Not a smile -- that really doesn't tell

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:17.150
about who you are and what you feel.

00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:19.150
They all accepted

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:22.150
to be pasted next to the other.

00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:24.150
I decided to paste

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:28.150
in eight Israeli and Palestinian cities

00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:31.150
and on both sides of the wall.

00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:34.150
We launched the biggest illegal art exhibition ever.

00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:37.150
We called the project Face 2 Face.

00:06:37.150 --> 00:06:40.150
The experts said, "No way.

00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:43.150
The people will not accept.

00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:45.150
The army will shoot you, and Hamas will kidnap you."

00:06:45.150 --> 00:06:48.150
We said, "Okay, let's try and push as far as we can."

00:06:49.150 --> 00:06:51.150
I love the way that people will ask me,

00:06:51.150 --> 00:06:53.150
"How big will my photo be?"

00:06:53.150 --> 00:06:56.150
"It will be as big as your house."

00:06:56.150 --> 00:06:59.150
When we did the wall, we did the Palestinian side.

00:06:59.150 --> 00:07:01.150
So we arrived with just our ladders

00:07:01.150 --> 00:07:03.150
and we realized that they were not high enough.

00:07:03.150 --> 00:07:05.150
And so Palestinians guys say,

00:07:05.150 --> 00:07:08.150
"Calm down. No wait. I'm going to find you a solution."

00:07:08.150 --> 00:07:11.150
So he went to the Church of Nativity

00:07:11.150 --> 00:07:13.150
and brought back an old ladder

00:07:13.150 --> 00:07:16.150
that was so old that it could have seen Jesus being born.

00:07:16.150 --> 00:07:18.150
(Laughter)

00:07:18.150 --> 00:07:21.150
We did Face 2 Face with only six friends,

00:07:21.150 --> 00:07:24.150
two ladders, two brushes,

00:07:24.150 --> 00:07:26.150
a rented car, a camera

00:07:26.150 --> 00:07:29.150
and 20,000 square feet of paper.

00:07:29.150 --> 00:07:31.150
We had all sorts of help

00:07:31.150 --> 00:07:34.150
from all walks of life.

00:07:36.150 --> 00:07:38.150
Okay, for example, that's Palestine.

00:07:38.150 --> 00:07:40.150
We're in Ramallah right now.

00:07:40.150 --> 00:07:42.150
We're pasting portraits --

00:07:42.150 --> 00:07:44.150
so both portraits in the streets in a crowded market.

00:07:44.150 --> 00:07:47.150
People come around us and start asking,

00:07:47.150 --> 00:07:49.150
"What are you doing here?"

00:07:49.150 --> 00:07:51.150
"Oh, we're actually doing an art project

00:07:51.150 --> 00:07:54.150
and we are pasting an Israeli and a Palestinian doing the same job.

00:07:54.150 --> 00:07:57.150
And those ones are actually two taxi-drivers."

00:07:57.150 --> 00:08:00.150
And then there was always a silence.

00:08:00.150 --> 00:08:03.150
"You mean you're pasting an Israeli face --

00:08:03.150 --> 00:08:05.150
doing a face -- right here?"

00:08:05.150 --> 00:08:08.150
"Well, yeah, yeah, that's part of the project."

00:08:08.150 --> 00:08:10.150
And I would always leave that moment,

00:08:10.150 --> 00:08:12.150
and we would ask them,

00:08:12.150 --> 00:08:15.150
"So can you tell me who is who?"

00:08:15.150 --> 00:08:17.150
And most of them couldn't say.

00:08:17.150 --> 00:08:23.150
(Applause)

00:08:23.150 --> 00:08:26.150
We even pasted on Israeli military towers,

00:08:26.150 --> 00:08:28.150
and nothing happened.

00:08:28.150 --> 00:08:31.150
When you paste an image, it's just paper and glue.

00:08:31.150 --> 00:08:34.150
People can tear it, tag on it, or even pee on it --

00:08:34.150 --> 00:08:36.150
some are a bit high for that, I agree --

00:08:36.150 --> 00:08:38.150
but the people in the street,

00:08:38.150 --> 00:08:40.150
they are the curator.

00:08:40.150 --> 00:08:42.150
The rain and the wind will take them off anyway.

00:08:42.150 --> 00:08:44.150
They are not meant to stay.

00:08:44.150 --> 00:08:47.150
But exactly four years after,

00:08:47.150 --> 00:08:50.150
the photos, most of them are still there.

00:08:50.150 --> 00:08:52.150
Face 2 Face demonstrated

00:08:52.150 --> 00:08:55.150
that what we thought impossible was possible --

00:08:55.150 --> 00:08:57.150
and, you know what, even easy.

00:08:57.150 --> 00:08:59.150
We didn't push the limit;

00:08:59.150 --> 00:09:02.150
we just showed that they were further than anyone thought.

00:09:04.150 --> 00:09:06.150
In the Middle East, I experienced my work

00:09:06.150 --> 00:09:08.150
in places without [many] museums.

00:09:08.150 --> 00:09:11.150
So the reactions in the street

00:09:11.150 --> 00:09:13.150
were kind of interesting.

00:09:13.150 --> 00:09:15.150
So I decided to go further in this direction

00:09:15.150 --> 00:09:19.150
and go in places where there were zero museums.

00:09:21.150 --> 00:09:24.150
When you go in these developing societies,

00:09:24.150 --> 00:09:27.150
women are the pillars of their community,

00:09:27.150 --> 00:09:30.150
but the men are still the ones holding the streets.

00:09:30.150 --> 00:09:33.150
So we were inspired to create a project

00:09:33.150 --> 00:09:36.150
where men will pay tribute to women

00:09:36.150 --> 00:09:39.150
by posting their photos.

00:09:39.150 --> 00:09:43.150
I called that project Women Are Heroes.

00:09:43.150 --> 00:09:45.150
When I listened to all the stories

00:09:45.150 --> 00:09:47.150
everywhere I went on the continents,

00:09:47.150 --> 00:09:49.150
I couldn't always understand

00:09:49.150 --> 00:09:52.150
the complicated circumstances of their conflict.

00:09:52.150 --> 00:09:55.150
I just observed.

00:09:55.150 --> 00:09:58.150
Sometimes there was no words,

00:09:58.150 --> 00:10:01.150
no sentence, just tears.

00:10:01.150 --> 00:10:04.150
I just took their pictures

00:10:04.150 --> 00:10:07.150
and pasted them.

00:10:08.150 --> 00:10:11.150
Women Are Heroes took me around the world.

00:10:11.150 --> 00:10:13.150
Most of the places I went to,

00:10:13.150 --> 00:10:15.150
I decided to go there

00:10:15.150 --> 00:10:17.150
because I've heard about it through the media.

00:10:17.150 --> 00:10:19.150
So for example, in June 2008,

00:10:19.150 --> 00:10:21.150
I was watching TV in Paris,

00:10:21.150 --> 00:10:23.150
and then I heard about this terrible thing

00:10:23.150 --> 00:10:25.150
that happened in Rio de Janeiro --

00:10:25.150 --> 00:10:29.150
the first favela of Brazil named Providencia.

00:10:29.150 --> 00:10:32.150
Three kids -- that was three students --

00:10:32.150 --> 00:10:34.150
were [detained] by the army

00:10:34.150 --> 00:10:36.150
because they were not carrying their papers.

00:10:36.150 --> 00:10:38.150
And the army took them,

00:10:38.150 --> 00:10:41.150
and instead of bringing them to the police station,

00:10:41.150 --> 00:10:44.150
they brought them to an enemy favela

00:10:44.150 --> 00:10:46.150
where they get chopped into pieces.

00:10:46.150 --> 00:10:48.150
I was shocked.

00:10:48.150 --> 00:10:50.150
All Brazil was shocked.

00:10:50.150 --> 00:10:53.150
I heard it was one of the most violent favelas,

00:10:53.150 --> 00:10:56.150
because the largest drug cartel controls it.

00:10:56.150 --> 00:10:58.150
So I decided to go there.

00:10:58.150 --> 00:11:00.150
When I arrived --

00:11:00.150 --> 00:11:03.150
I mean, I didn't have any contact with any NGO.

00:11:03.150 --> 00:11:06.150
There was none in place -- no association, no NGOs, nothing --

00:11:06.150 --> 00:11:08.150
no eyewitnesses.

00:11:08.150 --> 00:11:10.150
So we just walked around,

00:11:10.150 --> 00:11:12.150
and we met a woman,

00:11:12.150 --> 00:11:14.150
and I showed her my book.

00:11:14.150 --> 00:11:16.150
And she said, "You know what?

00:11:16.150 --> 00:11:18.150
We're hungry for culture.

00:11:18.150 --> 00:11:21.150
We need culture out there."

00:11:21.150 --> 00:11:24.150
So I went out and I started with the kids.

00:11:24.150 --> 00:11:26.150
I just took a few photos of the kids,

00:11:26.150 --> 00:11:29.150
and the next day I came with the posters and we pasted them.

00:11:29.150 --> 00:11:32.150
The day after, I came back and they were already scratched.

00:11:32.150 --> 00:11:34.150
But that's okay.

00:11:34.150 --> 00:11:37.150
I wanted them to feel that this art belongs to them.

00:11:38.150 --> 00:11:41.150
Then the next day, I held a meeting on the main square

00:11:41.150 --> 00:11:43.150
and some women came.

00:11:43.150 --> 00:11:47.150
They were all linked to the three kids that got killed.

00:11:48.150 --> 00:11:51.150
There was the mother, the grandmother, the best friend --

00:11:51.150 --> 00:11:54.150
they all wanted to shout the story.

00:11:55.150 --> 00:11:57.150
After that day,

00:11:57.150 --> 00:12:00.150
everyone in the favela gave me the green light.

00:12:00.150 --> 00:12:03.150
I took more photos, and we started the project.

00:12:03.150 --> 00:12:05.150
The drug lords were kind of worried

00:12:05.150 --> 00:12:07.150
about us filming in the place,

00:12:07.150 --> 00:12:09.150
so I told them, "You know what?

00:12:09.150 --> 00:12:11.150
I'm not interested in filming the violence and the weapons.

00:12:11.150 --> 00:12:13.150
You see that enough in the media.

00:12:13.150 --> 00:12:15.150
What I want to show is the incredible life and energy.

00:12:15.150 --> 00:12:18.150
I've been seeing it around me the last few days."

00:12:19.150 --> 00:12:21.150
So that's a really symbolic pasting,

00:12:21.150 --> 00:12:24.150
because that's the first one we did that you couldn't see from the city.

00:12:24.150 --> 00:12:27.150
And that's where the three kids got arrested,

00:12:27.150 --> 00:12:30.150
and that's the grandmother of one of them.

00:12:30.150 --> 00:12:32.150
And on that stairs,

00:12:32.150 --> 00:12:34.150
that's where the traffickers always stand

00:12:34.150 --> 00:12:36.150
and there's a lot of exchange of fire.

00:12:36.150 --> 00:12:39.150
Everyone there understood the project.

00:12:40.150 --> 00:12:43.150
And then we pasted everywhere -- the whole hill.

00:12:43.150 --> 00:12:53.150
(Applause)

00:12:53.150 --> 00:12:55.150
What was interesting is that the media couldn't get in.

00:12:55.150 --> 00:12:57.150
I mean, you should see that.

00:12:57.150 --> 00:13:00.150
They would have to film us from a really long distance by helicopter

00:13:00.150 --> 00:13:02.150
and then have a really long lens,

00:13:02.150 --> 00:13:04.150
and we would see ourselves, on TV, pasting.

00:13:04.150 --> 00:13:06.150
And they would put a number: "Please call this number

00:13:06.150 --> 00:13:08.150
if you know what's going on in Providencia."

00:13:08.150 --> 00:13:11.150
We just did a project and then left

00:13:11.150 --> 00:13:13.150
so the media wouldn't know.

00:13:13.150 --> 00:13:15.150
So how can we know about the project?

00:13:15.150 --> 00:13:18.150
So they had to go and find the women

00:13:18.150 --> 00:13:20.150
and get an explanation from them.

00:13:20.150 --> 00:13:23.150
So you create a bridge between the media

00:13:23.150 --> 00:13:26.150
and the anonymous women.

00:13:26.150 --> 00:13:28.150
We kept traveling.

00:13:28.150 --> 00:13:30.150
We went to Africa, Sudan, Sierra Leone,

00:13:30.150 --> 00:13:32.150
Liberia, Kenya.

00:13:32.150 --> 00:13:34.150
In war-torn places like Monrovia,

00:13:34.150 --> 00:13:36.150
people come straight to you.

00:13:36.150 --> 00:13:38.150
I mean, they want to know what you're up to.

00:13:38.150 --> 00:13:41.150
They kept asking me, "What is the purpose of your project?

00:13:41.150 --> 00:13:44.150
Are you an NGO? Are you the media?"

00:13:44.150 --> 00:13:47.150
Art. Just doing art.

00:13:47.150 --> 00:13:49.150
Some people question, "Why is it in black and white?

00:13:49.150 --> 00:13:51.150
Don't you have color in France?"

00:13:51.150 --> 00:13:53.150
(Laughter)

00:13:53.150 --> 00:13:55.150
Or they tell you, "Are these people all dead?"

00:13:55.150 --> 00:13:58.150
Some who understood the project would explain it to others.

00:13:58.150 --> 00:14:01.150
And to a man who did not understand, I heard someone say,

00:14:01.150 --> 00:14:04.150
"You know, you've been here for a few hours

00:14:04.150 --> 00:14:07.150
trying to understand, discussing with your fellows.

00:14:07.150 --> 00:14:09.150
During that time, you haven't thought about

00:14:09.150 --> 00:14:11.150
what you're going to eat tomorrow.

00:14:11.150 --> 00:14:14.150
This is art."

00:14:14.150 --> 00:14:17.150
I think it's people's curiosity

00:14:17.150 --> 00:14:20.150
that motivates them

00:14:20.150 --> 00:14:22.150
to come into the projects.

00:14:22.150 --> 00:14:24.150
And then it becomes more.

00:14:24.150 --> 00:14:27.150
It becomes a desire, a need, an armor.

00:14:28.150 --> 00:14:31.150
On this bridge that's in Monrovia,

00:14:31.150 --> 00:14:34.150
ex-rebel soldiers helped us pasting a portrait

00:14:34.150 --> 00:14:37.150
of a woman that might have been raped during the war.

00:14:37.150 --> 00:14:39.150
Women are always the first ones targeted

00:14:39.150 --> 00:14:42.150
during conflict.

00:14:42.150 --> 00:14:44.150
This is Kibera, Kenya,

00:14:44.150 --> 00:14:47.150
one of the largest slums of Africa.

00:14:47.150 --> 00:14:50.150
You might have seen images about the post-election violence

00:14:50.150 --> 00:14:53.150
that happened there in 2008.

00:14:54.150 --> 00:14:56.150
This time we covered the roofs of the houses,

00:14:56.150 --> 00:14:59.150
but we didn't use paper,

00:14:59.150 --> 00:15:02.150
because paper doesn't prevent the rain

00:15:02.150 --> 00:15:04.150
from leaking inside the house --

00:15:04.150 --> 00:15:06.150
vinyl does.

00:15:06.150 --> 00:15:08.150
Then art becomes useful.

00:15:08.150 --> 00:15:10.150
So the people kept it.

00:15:10.150 --> 00:15:13.150
You know what I love is, for example, when you see the biggest eye there,

00:15:13.150 --> 00:15:15.150
there are so [many] houses inside.

00:15:15.150 --> 00:15:17.150
And I went there a few months ago --

00:15:17.150 --> 00:15:20.150
photos are still there -- and it was missing a piece of the eye.

00:15:20.150 --> 00:15:22.150
So I asked the people what happened.

00:15:22.150 --> 00:15:24.150
"Oh, that guy just moved."

00:15:24.150 --> 00:15:28.150
(Laughter)

00:15:28.150 --> 00:15:31.150
When the roofs were covered, a woman said as a joke,

00:15:31.150 --> 00:15:33.150
"Now God can see me."

00:15:33.150 --> 00:15:35.150
When you look at Kibera now,

00:15:35.150 --> 00:15:37.150
they look back.

00:15:41.150 --> 00:15:43.150
Okay, India.

00:15:43.150 --> 00:15:45.150
Before I start that, just so you know,

00:15:45.150 --> 00:15:47.150
each time we go to a place, we don't have authorization,

00:15:47.150 --> 00:15:49.150
so we set up like commandos --

00:15:49.150 --> 00:15:51.150
we're a group of friends who arrive there,

00:15:51.150 --> 00:15:53.150
and we try to paste on the walls.

00:15:53.150 --> 00:15:56.150
But there are places where you just can't paste on a wall.

00:15:56.150 --> 00:15:59.150
In India it was just impossible to paste.

00:15:59.150 --> 00:16:02.150
I heard culturally and because of the law,

00:16:02.150 --> 00:16:05.150
they would just arrest us at the first pasting.

00:16:05.150 --> 00:16:07.150
So we decided to paste white,

00:16:07.150 --> 00:16:09.150
white on the walls.

00:16:09.150 --> 00:16:11.150
So imagine white guys pasting white papers.

00:16:11.150 --> 00:16:13.150
So people would come to us and ask us,

00:16:13.150 --> 00:16:15.150
"Hey, what are you up to?"

00:16:15.150 --> 00:16:18.150
"Oh, you know, we're just doing art." "Art?"

00:16:19.150 --> 00:16:21.150
Of course, they were confused.

00:16:21.150 --> 00:16:24.150
But you know how India has a lot of dust in the streets,

00:16:24.150 --> 00:16:26.150
and the more dust you would have

00:16:26.150 --> 00:16:28.150
going up in the air,

00:16:28.150 --> 00:16:31.150
on the white paper you can almost see,

00:16:31.150 --> 00:16:33.150
but there is this sticky part

00:16:33.150 --> 00:16:35.150
like when you reverse a sticker.

00:16:35.150 --> 00:16:38.150
So the more dust you have, the more it will reveal the photo.

00:16:38.150 --> 00:16:41.150
So we could just walk in the street during the next days

00:16:41.150 --> 00:16:43.150
and the photos would get revealed by themselves.

00:16:43.150 --> 00:16:50.150
(Applause)

00:16:50.150 --> 00:16:52.150
Thank you.

00:16:53.150 --> 00:16:55.150
So we didn't get caught this time.

00:16:58.150 --> 00:17:00.150
Each project -- that's a film

00:17:00.150 --> 00:17:03.150
from Women Are Heroes.

00:17:03.150 --> 00:17:06.150
(Music)

00:17:06.150 --> 00:17:08.150
Okay.

00:17:08.150 --> 00:17:10.150
For each project we do

00:17:10.150 --> 00:17:12.150
a film.

00:17:12.150 --> 00:17:15.150
And most of what you see -- that's a trailer from "Women Are Heroes" --

00:17:15.150 --> 00:17:18.150
its images, photography,

00:17:18.150 --> 00:17:21.150
taken one after the other.

00:17:39.150 --> 00:17:42.150
And the photos kept traveling even without us.

00:18:18.150 --> 00:18:20.150
(Laughter)

00:18:20.150 --> 00:18:30.150
(Applause)

00:18:30.150 --> 00:18:32.150
Hopefully, you'll see the film,

00:18:32.150 --> 00:18:34.150
and you'll understand the scope of the project

00:18:34.150 --> 00:18:36.150
and what the people felt when they saw those photos.

00:18:36.150 --> 00:18:39.150
Because that's a big part of it. There's layers behind each photo.

00:18:39.150 --> 00:18:42.150
Behind each image is a story.

00:18:42.150 --> 00:18:44.150
Women Are Heroes created a new dynamic

00:18:44.150 --> 00:18:46.150
in each of the communities,

00:18:46.150 --> 00:18:49.150
and the women kept that dynamic after we left.

00:18:49.150 --> 00:18:52.150
For example, we did books -- not for sale --

00:18:52.150 --> 00:18:54.150
that all the community would get.

00:18:54.150 --> 00:18:58.150
But to get it, they would have to [get] it signed by one of the women.

00:18:58.150 --> 00:19:00.150
We did that in most of the places.

00:19:00.150 --> 00:19:02.150
We go back regularly.

00:19:02.150 --> 00:19:05.150
And so in Providencia, for example, in the favela,

00:19:05.150 --> 00:19:07.150
we have a cultural center running there.

00:19:07.150 --> 00:19:09.150
In Kibera, each year we cover more roofs.

00:19:09.150 --> 00:19:12.150
Because of course, when we left, the people who were just at the edge of the project

00:19:12.150 --> 00:19:15.150
said, "Hey, what about my roof?"

00:19:15.150 --> 00:19:17.150
So we decided to come the year after

00:19:17.150 --> 00:19:20.150
and keep doing the project.

00:19:20.150 --> 00:19:22.150
A really important point for me

00:19:22.150 --> 00:19:25.150
is that I don't use any brand or corporate sponsors.

00:19:25.150 --> 00:19:27.150
So I have no responsibility

00:19:27.150 --> 00:19:29.150
to anyone but myself

00:19:29.150 --> 00:19:31.150
and the subjects.

00:19:31.150 --> 00:19:35.150
(Applause)

00:19:35.150 --> 00:19:37.150
And that is for me

00:19:37.150 --> 00:19:39.150
one of the more important things in the work.

00:19:39.150 --> 00:19:41.150
I think, today,

00:19:41.150 --> 00:19:44.150
as important as the result is the way you do things.

00:19:44.150 --> 00:19:47.150
And that has always been a central part of the work.

00:19:48.150 --> 00:19:50.150
And what's interesting is that fine line that I have

00:19:50.150 --> 00:19:52.150
with images and advertising.

00:19:52.150 --> 00:19:54.150
We just did some pasting in Los Angeles

00:19:54.150 --> 00:19:57.150
on another project in the last weeks.

00:19:57.150 --> 00:20:01.150
And I was even invited to cover the MOCA museum.

00:20:01.150 --> 00:20:03.150
But yesterday the city called them and said,

00:20:03.150 --> 00:20:05.150
"Look, you're going to have to tear it down.

00:20:05.150 --> 00:20:07.150
Because this can be taken for advertising,

00:20:07.150 --> 00:20:09.150
and because of the law,

00:20:09.150 --> 00:20:11.150
it has to be taken down."

00:20:11.150 --> 00:20:14.150
But tell me, advertising for what?

00:20:14.150 --> 00:20:16.150
The people I photograph

00:20:16.150 --> 00:20:18.150
were proud to participate in the project

00:20:18.150 --> 00:20:20.150
and to have their photo in the community.

00:20:20.150 --> 00:20:22.150
But they asked me for a promise basically.

00:20:22.150 --> 00:20:26.150
They asked me, "Please, make our story travel with you."

00:20:26.150 --> 00:20:29.150
So I did. That's Paris.

00:20:29.150 --> 00:20:31.150
That's Rio.

00:20:31.150 --> 00:20:35.150
In each place, we built exhibitions with a story, and the story traveled.

00:20:35.150 --> 00:20:37.150
You understand the full scope of the project.

00:20:37.150 --> 00:20:40.150
That's London.

00:20:40.150 --> 00:20:42.150
New York.

00:20:42.150 --> 00:20:45.150
And today, they are with you in Long Beach.

00:20:46.150 --> 00:20:49.150
All right, recently I started a public art project

00:20:49.150 --> 00:20:52.150
where I don't use my artwork anymore.

00:20:52.150 --> 00:20:55.150
I use Man Ray, Helen Levitt,

00:20:55.150 --> 00:20:57.150
Giacomelli, other people's artwork.

00:20:57.150 --> 00:21:00.150
It doesn't matter today if it's your photo or not.

00:21:00.150 --> 00:21:02.150
The importance is what you do

00:21:02.150 --> 00:21:04.150
with the images,

00:21:04.150 --> 00:21:07.150
the statement it makes where it's pasted.

00:21:07.150 --> 00:21:10.150
So for example, I pasted the photo of the minaret

00:21:10.150 --> 00:21:12.150
in Switzerland

00:21:12.150 --> 00:21:16.150
a few weeks after they voted the law forbidding minarets in the country.

00:21:16.150 --> 00:21:22.150
(Applause)

00:21:22.150 --> 00:21:25.150
This image of three men wearing gas masks

00:21:25.150 --> 00:21:27.150
was taken in Chernobyl originally,

00:21:27.150 --> 00:21:30.150
and I pasted it in Southern Italy,

00:21:30.150 --> 00:21:34.150
where the mafia sometimes bury the garbage under the ground.

00:21:36.150 --> 00:21:38.150
In some ways, art can change the world.

00:21:38.150 --> 00:21:40.150
Art is not supposed to change the world,

00:21:40.150 --> 00:21:42.150
to change practical things,

00:21:42.150 --> 00:21:44.150
but to change perceptions.

00:21:44.150 --> 00:21:46.150
Art can change

00:21:46.150 --> 00:21:48.150
the way we see the world.

00:21:48.150 --> 00:21:51.150
Art can create an analogy.

00:21:51.150 --> 00:21:54.150
Actually the fact that art cannot change things

00:21:54.150 --> 00:21:56.150
makes it a neutral place

00:21:56.150 --> 00:21:59.150
for exchanges and discussions,

00:21:59.150 --> 00:22:02.150
and then enables you to change the world.

00:22:02.150 --> 00:22:04.150
When I do my work,

00:22:04.150 --> 00:22:06.150
I have two kinds of reactions.

00:22:06.150 --> 00:22:09.150
People say, "Oh, why don't you go in Iraq or Afghanistan.

00:22:09.150 --> 00:22:11.150
They would be really useful."

00:22:11.150 --> 00:22:14.150
Or, "How can we help?"

00:22:14.150 --> 00:22:17.150
I presume that you belong to the second category,

00:22:17.150 --> 00:22:19.150
and that's good,

00:22:19.150 --> 00:22:21.150
because for that project,

00:22:21.150 --> 00:22:23.150
I'm going to ask you to take the photos

00:22:23.150 --> 00:22:26.150
and paste them.

00:22:26.150 --> 00:22:28.150
So now my wish is:

00:22:28.150 --> 00:22:30.150
(mock drum roll)

00:22:30.150 --> 00:22:32.150
(Laughter)

00:22:33.150 --> 00:22:36.150
I wish for you to stand up

00:22:36.150 --> 00:22:39.150
for what you care about

00:22:39.150 --> 00:22:42.150
by participating in a global art project,

00:22:42.150 --> 00:22:47.150
and together we'll turn the world inside out.

00:22:48.150 --> 00:22:50.150
And this starts right now.

00:22:50.150 --> 00:22:52.150
Yes, everyone in the room.

00:22:52.150 --> 00:22:55.150
Everyone watching.

00:22:55.150 --> 00:22:57.150
I wanted that wish

00:22:57.150 --> 00:22:59.150
to actually start now.

00:22:59.150 --> 00:23:02.150
So a subject you're passionate about, a person who you want to tell their story

00:23:02.150 --> 00:23:04.150
or even your own photos --

00:23:04.150 --> 00:23:06.150
tell me what you stand for.

00:23:06.150 --> 00:23:08.150
Take the photos, the portraits,

00:23:08.150 --> 00:23:11.150
upload it -- I'll give you all the details --

00:23:11.150 --> 00:23:14.150
and I'll send you back your poster. Join by groups

00:23:14.150 --> 00:23:17.150
and reveal things to the world.

00:23:17.150 --> 00:23:20.150
The full data is on the website --

00:23:20.150 --> 00:23:22.150
insideoutproject.net --

00:23:22.150 --> 00:23:25.150
that is launching today.

00:23:25.150 --> 00:23:27.150
What we see changes who we are.

00:23:27.150 --> 00:23:29.150
When we act together,

00:23:29.150 --> 00:23:32.150
the whole thing is much more than the sum of the parts.

00:23:33.150 --> 00:23:35.150
So I hope that, together, we'll create something

00:23:35.150 --> 00:23:37.150
that the world will remember.

00:23:37.150 --> 00:23:40.150
And this starts right now and depends on you.

00:23:40.150 --> 00:23:42.150
Thank you.

00:23:42.150 --> 00:23:49.150
(Applause)

00:23:49.150 --> 00:23:51.150
Thank you.

00:23:51.150 --> 00:23:59.150
(Applause)
