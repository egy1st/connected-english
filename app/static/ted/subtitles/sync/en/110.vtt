This is about a place in London

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:17.150
called Kiteflyer's Hill

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:19.150
where I used to go and spend hours

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:22.150
going "When is he coming back? When is he coming back?"

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:25.150
So this is another one dedicated to that guy ...

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:28.150
who I've got over.

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:30.150
But this is "Kiteflyer's Hill."

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:34.150
It's a beautiful song written by a guy called Martin Evan,

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:35.150
actually, for me.

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:38.150
Boo Hewerdine, Thomas Dolby,

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:41.150
thank you very much for inviting me. It's been a blessing singing for you.

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:43.150
Thank you very much.

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:52.150
♫ Do you remember when we used to go ♫

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:57.150
♫ up to Kiteflyer's Hill? ♫

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:07.150
♫ Those summer nights, so still ♫

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:12.150
♫ with all of the city beneath us ♫

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:17.150
♫ and all of our lives ahead ♫

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:22.150
♫ before cruel and foolish words ♫

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:27.150
♫ were cruelly and foolishly said ♫

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:30.150
♫ Some nights I think of you ♫

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.150
♫ and then I go up ♫

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:37.150
♫ on Kiteflyer's Hill ♫

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:47.150
♫ wrapped up against the winter chill ♫

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:53.150
♫ And somewhere in the city beneath me ♫

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:57.150
♫ you lie asleep in your bed ♫

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:02.150
♫ and I wonder if ever just briefly ♫

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:07.150
♫ do I creep in your dreams now and then ♫

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:13.150
♫ Where are you now? ♫

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:22.150
♫ My wild summer love ♫

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:33.150
♫ Where are you now? ♫

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:37.150
♫ Have the years been kind? ♫

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:41.150
♫ And do you think of me sometimes ♫

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:47.150
♫ up on Kiteflyer's Hill? ♫

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:55.150
♫ Oh, I pray you one day will ♫

00:02:55.150 --> 00:03:00.150
♫ We won't say a word ♫

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:03.150
♫ We won't need them ♫

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:06.150
♫ Sometimes silence is best ♫

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:11.150
♫ We'll just stand in the still of the evening ♫

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:16.150
♫ and whisper farewell to loneliness ♫

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:21.150
♫ Where are you now? ♫

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:31.150
♫ My wild summer love ♫

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:39.150
♫ Where are you now? ♫

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:45.150
♫ Do you think of me sometimes? ♫

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:48.150
♫ And do you ever make that climb? ♫

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:54.150
♫ Where are you now? ♫

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:02.150
♫ My wild summer love ♫

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:12.150
♫ Where are you now? ♫

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:17.150
♫ Have the years been kind? ♫

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:21.150
♫ And do you ever make that climb ♫

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:38.150
♫ up on Kiteflyer's Hill? Kiteflyer's ... ♫

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:55.150
♫ [French] ♫

00:04:55.150 --> 00:05:22.150
♫ Where are you? Where are you now? ♫

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:55.150
♫ Where are you now? ♫

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:07.150
♫ Kiteflyer's ... ♫

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:10.150
(Applause)

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:13.150
Gracias. Thank you very much.
