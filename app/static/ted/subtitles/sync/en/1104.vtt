00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.150
I want you now to imagine

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:18.150
a wearable robot

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.150
that gives you superhuman abilities,

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:26.150
or another one that takes wheelchair users

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:29.150
up standing and walking again.

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:33.150
We at Berkeley Bionics

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:36.150
call these robots exoskeletons.

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:39.150
These are nothing else

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:42.150
than something that you put on in the morning,

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:45.150
and it will give you extra strength,

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:49.150
and it will further enhance your speed,

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:53.150
and it will help you, for instance, to manage your balance.

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:57.150
It is actually the true integration

00:00:57.150 --> 00:00:59.150
of the man and the machine.

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:01.150
But not only that --

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:03.150
it will integrate and network you

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:05.150
to the universe

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:07.150
and other devices out there.

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:10.150
This is just not some blue sky thinking.

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:13.150
To show you now what we are working on

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:15.150
by starting out talking about

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.150
the American soldier,

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:21.150
that on average does carry about 100 lbs. on their backs,

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:24.150
and they are being asked to carry more equipment.

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.150
Obviously, this is resulting

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.150
in some major complications --

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:33.150
back injuries, 30 percent of them --

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.150
chronic back injuries.

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:38.150
So we thought we would look at this challenge

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:41.150
and create an exoskeleton

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:45.150
that would help deal with this issue.

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:49.150
So let me now introduce to you HULC --

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:51.150
or the Human Universal

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:53.150
Load Carrier.

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:56.150
Soldier: With the HULC exoskeleton,

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:58.150
I can carry 200 lbs. over varied terrain

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:00.150
for many hours.

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:02.150
Its flexible design allows for deep squats,

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:05.150
crawls and high-agility movements.

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:08.150
It senses what I want to do, where I want to go,

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:11.150
and then augments my strength and endurance.

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:17.150
Eythor Bender: We are ready with our industry partner

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:19.150
to introduce this device,

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:22.150
this new exoskeleton this year.

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:24.150
So this is for real.

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:27.150
Now let's turn our heads

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:30.150
towards the wheelchair users,

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:33.150
something that I'm particularly passionate about.

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:35.150
There are 68 million people

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:38.150
estimated to be in wheelchairs worldwide.

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:41.150
This is about one percent of the total population.

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:44.150
And that's actually a conservative estimate.

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:46.150
We are talking here about, oftentimes,

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:49.150
very young individuals with spinal cord injuries,

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:52.150
that in the prime of their life -- 20s, 30s, 40s --

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:54.150
hit a wall

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:56.150
and the wheelchair's the only option.

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:58.150
But it is also the aging population

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:01.150
that is multiplying in numbers.

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:04.150
And the only option, pretty much --

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:06.150
when it's stroke or other complications --

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:08.150
is the wheelchair.

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:12.150
And that is actually for the last 500 years,

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:15.150
since its very successful introduction, I must say.

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:18.150
So we thought we would start

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:21.150
writing a brand new chapter

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:24.150
of mobility.

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:27.150
Let me now introduce you to eLEGS

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:31.150
that is worn by Amanda Boxtel

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:35.150
that 19 years ago was spinal cord injured,

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:37.150
and as a result of that

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:39.150
she has not been able to walk

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:42.150
for 19 years until now.

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:45.150
(Applause)

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:47.150
Amanda Boxtel: Thank you.

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:50.150
(Applause)

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:56.150
EB: Amanda is wearing our eLEGS set.

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:59.150
It has sensors.

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:01.150
It's completely non-invasive,

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:03.150
sensors in the crutches

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:06.150
that send signals back to our onboard computer

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:09.150
that is sitting here at her back.

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:11.150
There are battery packs here as well

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:14.150
that power motors that are sitting at her hips,

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:16.150
as well as her knee joints,

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:18.150
that move her forward

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:22.150
in this kind of smooth and very natural gait.

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:27.150
AB: I was 24 years old

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:29.150
and at the top of my game

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:32.150
when a freak summersault while downhill skiing

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:34.150
paralyzed me.

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:36.150
In a split second,

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:39.150
I lost all sensation and movement

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:42.150
below my pelvis.

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:44.150
Not long afterwards,

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:47.150
a doctor strode into my hospital room,

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:49.150
and he said, "Amanda,

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:53.150
you'll never walk again."

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:56.150
And that was 19 yeas ago.

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:58.150
He robbed

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:00.150
every ounce of hope

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:02.150
from my being.

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:04.150
Adaptive technology

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:06.150
has since enabled me

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:08.150
to learn how to downhill ski again,

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:11.150
to rock climb and even handcycle.

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:15.150
But nothing has been invented

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:17.150
that enables me to walk,

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:19.150
until now.

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:22.150
(Applause)

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:24.150
Thank you.

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:32.150
(Applause)

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:34.150
EB: As you can see,

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:36.150
we have the technology,

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:38.150
we have the platforms

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:41.150
to sit down and have discussions with you.

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:43.150
It's in our hands,

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:47.150
and we have all the potential here

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:49.150
to change the lives

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:51.150
of future generations --

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:55.150
not only for the soldiers,

00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:59.150
or for Amanda here and all the wheelchair users,

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:01.150
but for everyone.

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:03.150
AB: Thanks.

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:14.150
(Applause)
