00:02:23.669 --> 00:02:26.677
Pep Rosenfeld: Folks,
you've just met Claron McFadden.

00:02:26.701 --> 00:02:29.288
She is a world-class soprano singer

00:02:29.312 --> 00:02:31.126
who studied in Rochester, New York.

00:02:31.828 --> 00:02:35.125
Her celebrated operatic roles
are numerous and varied.

00:02:35.539 --> 00:02:41.110
In August 2007, Claron was awarded
the Amsterdam Prize for the Arts,

00:02:41.134 --> 00:02:42.949
winning praise for her brilliance,

00:02:42.973 --> 00:02:46.379
her amazing and extensively
wide repertoire

00:02:46.403 --> 00:02:48.126
and her vivid stage personality.

00:02:48.594 --> 00:02:50.540
Please welcome Claron McFadden.

00:02:50.564 --> 00:02:57.484
(Applause)

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:03.217
Claron McFadden: The human voice:

00:03:04.224 --> 00:03:07.997
mysterious, spontaneous, primal.

00:03:09.943 --> 00:03:14.880
For me, the human voice is the vessel
on which all emotions travel --

00:03:14.904 --> 00:03:16.817
except, perhaps, jealousy.

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:20.205
And the breath,

00:03:20.229 --> 00:03:22.385
the breath is the captain of that vessel.

00:03:24.481 --> 00:03:26.043
A child is born,

00:03:27.448 --> 00:03:29.091
takes its first breath --

00:03:29.753 --> 00:03:33.666
(Inhales)

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:36.050
Whah!

00:03:37.421 --> 00:03:40.487
And we behold the wondrous beauty

00:03:41.844 --> 00:03:43.328
of vocal expression --

00:03:44.078 --> 00:03:46.701
mysterious, spontaneous

00:03:47.789 --> 00:03:48.940
and primal.

00:03:50.813 --> 00:03:53.955
A few years ago, I did
a meditation retreat in Thailand.

00:03:53.979 --> 00:03:55.432
I wanted a place

00:03:56.169 --> 00:04:00.126
where I would have total silence
and total solitude.

00:04:00.878 --> 00:04:03.485
I spent two weeks at this retreat

00:04:03.509 --> 00:04:05.223
in my own little hut --

00:04:05.247 --> 00:04:08.056
no music, no nothing -- sounds of nature,

00:04:09.104 --> 00:04:12.643
trying to find the essence
of concentration,

00:04:12.667 --> 00:04:14.125
being in the moment.

00:04:14.827 --> 00:04:16.684
On my last day,

00:04:16.708 --> 00:04:18.827
the woman who looked after the place,

00:04:19.565 --> 00:04:21.741
she came and we spoke for a minute,

00:04:21.765 --> 00:04:23.233
and then she said to me,

00:04:24.471 --> 00:04:26.126
"Would you sing something for me?"

00:04:26.805 --> 00:04:30.082
And I thought, but this is a place
of total quiet and silence.

00:04:30.106 --> 00:04:31.637
I can't make noise.

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:35.150
She said, "Please, sing for me."

00:04:36.443 --> 00:04:38.126
So I closed my eyes,

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:40.347
I took breath

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:44.490
and the first thing that came up and out

00:04:45.355 --> 00:04:46.752
was "Summertime,"

00:04:47.927 --> 00:04:49.125
Porgy and Bess.

00:04:49.149 --> 00:04:53.292
(Singing) Summertime
and the livin' is easy.

00:04:54.522 --> 00:04:57.664
Fish are jumpin' and the cotton is high.

00:04:57.688 --> 00:05:01.673
Oh, your daddy's rich
and your ma is good-lookin'.

00:05:01.697 --> 00:05:03.287
So hush little baby,

00:05:03.311 --> 00:05:05.736
don't you cry.

00:05:06.993 --> 00:05:08.704
And I opened my eyes,

00:05:09.363 --> 00:05:12.126
and I saw that she had her eyes closed.

00:05:12.891 --> 00:05:14.994
And after a moment, she opened her eyes

00:05:15.018 --> 00:05:16.676
and she looked at me and she said,

00:05:17.915 --> 00:05:19.552
"It's like meditation."

00:05:20.655 --> 00:05:22.877
And in that moment I understood

00:05:22.901 --> 00:05:26.313
that everything I had gone
to Thailand to look for,

00:05:26.337 --> 00:05:27.923
to search for,

00:05:27.947 --> 00:05:30.342
I had it already in my singing --

00:05:31.756 --> 00:05:34.709
the calm, but alertness,

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:38.043
the focus, but awareness,

00:05:38.694 --> 00:05:41.503
and being totally in the moment.

00:05:43.185 --> 00:05:44.931
When you're totally in the moment --

00:05:44.955 --> 00:05:46.454
when I'm totally in the moment,

00:05:46.478 --> 00:05:48.683
the vessel of expression is open.

00:05:48.707 --> 00:05:51.279
The emotions can flow from me

00:05:51.303 --> 00:05:52.476
to you

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:53.696
and back.

00:05:54.707 --> 00:05:56.596
It's an extremely profound experience.

00:05:58.937 --> 00:06:01.287
There's a piece by a composer,

00:06:01.311 --> 00:06:03.909
an American composer called John Cage.

00:06:03.933 --> 00:06:05.513
It's called "Aria."

00:06:05.537 --> 00:06:10.126
It was written for an amazing singer
called Cathy Berberian.

00:06:10.642 --> 00:06:13.126
And the thing about this piece
that's so special --

00:06:13.832 --> 00:06:15.126
if you see it behind me --

00:06:16.157 --> 00:06:18.331
it's not notated in any way.

00:06:19.559 --> 00:06:22.250
No notes, no flats, no sharps.

00:06:22.948 --> 00:06:24.694
But it's a kind of structure.

00:06:25.321 --> 00:06:27.781
And the singer, within this structure,

00:06:27.805 --> 00:06:31.825
has total freedom
to be creative, spontaneous.

00:06:32.428 --> 00:06:33.579
For example,

00:06:34.722 --> 00:06:36.269
there are different colors

00:06:36.293 --> 00:06:40.245
and each color gets
a different type of singing --

00:06:40.269 --> 00:06:44.158
pop, country and western, opera, jazz --

00:06:44.182 --> 00:06:47.309
and you just have
to be consistent with that color.

00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:50.349
You see there are different lines.

00:06:50.888 --> 00:06:53.095
You choose in your own tempo
in your own way

00:06:53.119 --> 00:06:54.372
to follow the line,

00:06:54.396 --> 00:06:55.804
but you must respect it,

00:06:56.616 --> 00:06:57.773
more or less.

00:06:58.281 --> 00:06:59.765
And these little dots,

00:07:00.796 --> 00:07:04.214
these represent a sort of sound

00:07:05.349 --> 00:07:08.126
that's not a vocal, not a lyrical way

00:07:08.150 --> 00:07:10.357
of expressing the voice.

00:07:10.381 --> 00:07:12.442
Using the body -- it could be sneezing,

00:07:12.466 --> 00:07:14.045
it could be coughing, animals --

00:07:14.069 --> 00:07:15.664
(Audience member coughs)

00:07:15.688 --> 00:07:16.980
Exactly. (Laughter)

00:07:17.004 --> 00:07:18.657
Clapping, whatever.

00:07:20.028 --> 00:07:21.995
And there's different text.

00:07:22.019 --> 00:07:25.754
There's Armenian, Russian,
French, English, Italian.

00:07:26.349 --> 00:07:28.857
So within this structure, one is free.

00:07:29.835 --> 00:07:32.438
To me, this piece is an ode to the voice,

00:07:33.882 --> 00:07:36.430
because it's mysterious, as we can see.

00:07:38.303 --> 00:07:39.945
It's quite spontaneous.

00:07:42.701 --> 00:07:44.044
And it's primal.

00:07:44.655 --> 00:07:46.845
So I would like to share
this piece with you,

00:07:46.869 --> 00:07:48.819
It's "Aria," of John Cage.

00:07:56.418 --> 00:07:57.871

00:07:57.895 --> 00:08:02.347
