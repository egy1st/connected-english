00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:14.150
(Applause)

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:16.150
Thank you.

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:25.150
(Music)

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:28.150
♫ Slide into the shimmering surface ♫

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:31.150
♫ between two worlds. ♫

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:37.150
♫ Standing at the center of time ♫

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:40.150
♫ as it uncurls. ♫

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:46.150
♫ Cutting through the veil of illusion. ♫

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:50.150
♫ Moving beyond past conclusions. ♫

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:55.150
♫ Wondering if all my doubt and confusion will clear. ♫

00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:00.150
♫ If I could be anywhere, ♫

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:04.150
♫ if I could be anywhere, ♫

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.150
♫ if I could be anywhere right now, ♫

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.150
♫ I would want to be here. ♫

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.150
♫ Searching for the future ♫

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:20.150
♫ among the things we're throwing away. ♫

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:25.150
♫ Trying to see the world ♫

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:29.150
♫ through the junk we produce everyday. ♫

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:35.150
♫ They say nothing lasts forever, ♫

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:39.150
♫ but all the plastic ever made is still here. ♫

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:42.150
♫ And no amount of closing our eyes ♫

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:45.150
♫ will make it disappear. ♫

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:50.150
♫ If I could be anywhere, ♫

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:54.150
♫ if I could be anywhere, ♫

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:58.150
♫ if I could be anywhere in history, ♫

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:02.150
♫ I would want to be here. ♫

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:06.150
♫ The Romans, the Spanish ♫

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:08.150
♫ the British, the Dutch, ♫

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:12.150
♫ American exceptionalism, so out of touch. ♫

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:16.150
♫ The folly of empire repeating its course, ♫

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:18.150
♫ imposing its will ♫

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:21.150
♫ and ruling by force ♫

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:24.150
♫ on and on through time. ♫

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:28.150
♫ But the world can't take it very much longer. ♫

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:30.150
♫ We're not going to make it ♫

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:32.150
♫ unless we're smarter and stronger. ♫

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:36.150
♫ The world is going to shake itself free of our greed ♫

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:39.150
♫ somehow. ♫

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:46.150
♫ If I could be anywhere, ♫

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:51.150
♫ if I could be anywhere in time, ♫

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:55.150
♫ if I could be anywhere and change things, ♫

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:59.150
♫ it would have to be now. ♫

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:04.150
♫ They say nothing last forever, ♫

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:08.150
♫ but all the plastic ever made is still here. ♫

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:11.150
♫ And no amount of closing our eyes ♫

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:14.150
♫ will make it disappear. ♫

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:19.150
♫ And the world can't take it ♫

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:21.150
♫ very much longer. ♫

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:23.150
♫ We're not going to make it ♫

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:25.150
♫ unless we're smarter and stronger. ♫

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:29.150
♫ The world's gonna shake itself free of our greed ♫

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:32.150
♫ somehow. ♫

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:36.150
♫ And the world can't take it, that you can see. ♫

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:41.150
♫ If the oceans don't make it, neither will we. ♫

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:45.150
♫ The world's gonna shake itself all the way free ♫

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:48.150
♫ somehow. ♫

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:51.150
♫ If I could be anywhere, ♫

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:56.150
♫ if I could be anywhere in time, ♫

00:03:56.150 --> 00:04:01.150
♫ if I could be anywhere and change the outcome, ♫

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:05.150
♫ it would have to be now. ♫

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:09.150
(Applause)

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:11.150
Thank you.

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:17.150
