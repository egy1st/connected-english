00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:16.066
I am the daughter of a forger,

00:00:16.066 --> 00:00:18.011
not just any forger ...

00:00:18.011 --> 00:00:20.928
When you hear the word "forger," you often understand "mercenary."

00:00:20.928 --> 00:00:24.450
You understand "forged currency," "forged pictures."

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:26.762
My father is no such man.

00:00:26.762 --> 00:00:27.950
For 30 years of his life,

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:30.652
he made false papers --

00:00:30.652 --> 00:00:32.597
never for himself, always for other people,

00:00:32.597 --> 00:00:36.486
and to come to the aid of the persecuted and the oppressed.

00:00:36.486 --> 00:00:38.650
Let me introduce him.

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:41.650
Here is my father at age 19.

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:45.650
It all began for him during World War II,

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:47.650
when at age 17 he found himself thrust

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:49.350
into a forged documents workshop.

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.850
He quickly became the false papers expert of the Resistance.

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.650
And it's not a banal story --

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:58.650
after the liberation he continued

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:01.750
to make false papers until the '70s.

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:03.400
When I was a child

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:05.548
I knew nothing about this, of course.

00:01:05.548 --> 00:01:08.050
This is me in the middle making faces.

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:10.382
I grew up in the Paris suburbs

00:01:10.382 --> 00:01:14.271
and I was the youngest of three children.

00:01:14.271 --> 00:01:17.161
I had a "normal" dad like everybody else,

00:01:17.161 --> 00:01:19.106
apart from the fact that he was 30 years older than ...

00:01:19.106 --> 00:01:22.995
well, he was basically old enough to be my grandfather.

00:01:22.995 --> 00:01:25.950
Anyway, he was a photographer and a street educator,

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.550
and he always taught us to obey the law very strictly.

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:31.850
And, of course, he never talked about his past life

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:34.050
when he was a forger.

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:36.609
There was, however, an incident I'm going to tell you about,

00:01:36.609 --> 00:01:39.526
that perhaps could have led me suspect something.

00:01:39.526 --> 00:01:42.443
I was in high school and got a bad grade,

00:01:42.443 --> 00:01:44.388
a rare event for me,

00:01:44.388 --> 00:01:47.333
so I decided to hide it from my parents.

00:01:47.333 --> 00:01:51.222
In order to do that, I set out to forge their signature.

00:01:51.222 --> 00:01:54.350
I started working on my mother's signature,

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:57.057
because my father's is absolutely impossible to forge.

00:01:57.057 --> 00:01:59.974
So, I got working. I took some sheets of paper

00:01:59.974 --> 00:02:02.891
and started practicing, practicing, practicing,

00:02:02.892 --> 00:02:04.836
until I reached what I thought was a steady hand,

00:02:04.836 --> 00:02:06.780
and went into action.

00:02:06.781 --> 00:02:09.150
Later, while checking my school bag,

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:12.642
my mother got hold of my school assignment and immediately saw that the signature was forged.

00:02:12.642 --> 00:02:14.587
She yelled at me like she never had before.

00:02:14.587 --> 00:02:17.504
I went to hide in my bedroom, under the blankets,

00:02:17.504 --> 00:02:20.449
and then I waited for my father to come back from work

00:02:20.449 --> 00:02:22.339
with, one could say, much apprehension.

00:02:22.339 --> 00:02:24.311
I heard him come in.

00:02:24.311 --> 00:02:28.228
I remained under the blankets. He entered my room,

00:02:28.228 --> 00:02:30.173
sat on the corner of the bed,

00:02:30.173 --> 00:02:33.063
and he was silent, so I pulled the blanket from my head,

00:02:33.063 --> 00:02:35.980
and when he saw me he started laughing.

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:38.897
He was laughing so hard, he could not stop and he was holding my assignment in his hand.

00:02:38.897 --> 00:02:43.250
Then he said, "But really, Sarah, you could have worked harder! Can't you see it's really too small?"

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:49.150
Indeed, it's rather small.

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:51.150
I was born in Algeria.

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:54.455
There I would hear people say my father was a "moudjahid"

00:02:54.455 --> 00:02:55.650
and that means "fighter."

00:02:55.650 --> 00:03:00.234
Later on, in France, I loved eavesdropping on grownups' conversations,

00:03:00.234 --> 00:03:03.151
and I would hear all sorts of stories about my father's previous life,

00:03:03.151 --> 00:03:06.069
especially that he had "done" World War II,

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:08.013
that he had "done" the Algerian war.

00:03:08.013 --> 00:03:10.931
And in my head I would be thinking that "doing" a war meant being a soldier.

00:03:10.931 --> 00:03:14.848
But knowing my father, and how he kept saying that he was a pacifist and non-violent,

00:03:14.848 --> 00:03:18.150
I found it very hard to picture him with a helmet and gun.

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:20.150
And indeed, I was very far from the mark.

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:23.350
One day, while my father was working on a file

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:26.516
for us to obtain French nationality,

00:03:26.516 --> 00:03:28.461
I happened to see some documents

00:03:28.461 --> 00:03:30.878
that caught my attention.

00:03:30.878 --> 00:03:32.550
These are real!

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:35.268
These are mine, I was born an Argentinean.

00:03:35.268 --> 00:03:37.050
But the document I happened to see

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:39.157
that would help us build a case for the authorities

00:03:39.157 --> 00:03:41.850
was a document from the army

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:45.019
that thanked my father for his work

00:03:45.019 --> 00:03:46.938
on behalf of the secret services.

00:03:46.938 --> 00:03:49.855
And then, suddenly, I went "wow!"

00:03:49.855 --> 00:03:51.550
My father, a secret agent?

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:53.716
It was very James Bond.

00:03:53.716 --> 00:03:58.605
I wanted to ask him questions, which he didn't answer.

00:03:58.605 --> 00:04:01.550
And later, I told myself that

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:04.150
one day I would have to question him.

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:06.301
And then I became a mother and had a son,

00:04:06.301 --> 00:04:09.450
and finally decided it was time -- that he absolutely had to talk to us.

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:11.450
I had become a mother

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:13.450
and he was celebrating his 77th birthday,

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:15.750
and suddenly I was very, very afraid.

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:17.998
I feared he'd go

00:04:17.998 --> 00:04:19.943
and take his silences with him,

00:04:19.943 --> 00:04:21.887
and take his secrets with him.

00:04:21.887 --> 00:04:24.250
I managed to convince him that it was important for us,

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:25.777
but possibly also for other people

00:04:25.777 --> 00:04:27.722
that he shared his story.

00:04:27.722 --> 00:04:29.666
He decided to tell it to me

00:04:29.666 --> 00:04:30.950
and I made a book,

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:33.556
from which I'm going to read you some excerpts later.

00:04:33.556 --> 00:04:36.473
So, his story. My father was born in Argentina.

00:04:36.473 --> 00:04:38.418
His parents were of Russian descent.

00:04:38.418 --> 00:04:42.335
The whole family came to settle in France in the '30s.

00:04:42.336 --> 00:04:47.150
His parents were Jewish, Russian and above all, very poor.

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:50.150
So at the age of 14 my father had to work.

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:51.350
And with his only diploma,

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:52.650
his primary education certificate,

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:55.150
he found himself working at a dyer - dry cleaner.

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:58.350
That's where he discovered something totally magical,

00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:00.150
and when he talks about it, it's fascinating --

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:02.950
it's the magic of dyeing chemistry.

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:04.750
During that time the war was happening

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:07.617
and his mother was killed when he was 15.

00:05:07.618 --> 00:05:10.150
This coincided with the time when

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:12.150
he threw himself body and soul into chemistry

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:14.850
because it was the only consolation for his sadness.

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:18.313
All day he would ask many questions to his boss

00:05:18.314 --> 00:05:21.150
to learn, to accumulate more and more knowledge,

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:22.650
and at night, when no one was looking,

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:24.850
he'd put his experience to practice.

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:29.950
He was mostly interested in ink bleaching.

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:32.150
All this to tell you

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:34.650
that if my father became a forger, actually,

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:36.650
it was almost by accident.

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:39.150
His family was Jewish, so they were hounded.

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:42.150
Finally they were all arrested and taken to the Drancy camp

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:45.350
and they managed to get out at the last minute thanks to their Argentinean papers.

00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:46.485
Well, they were out,

00:05:46.486 --> 00:05:49.402
but they were always in danger. The big "Jew" stamp was still on their papers.

00:05:49.403 --> 00:05:52.650
It was my grandfather who decided they needed false documents.

00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:56.150
My father had been instilled with such respect for the law

00:05:56.150 --> 00:05:58.150
that although he was being persecuted,

00:05:58.150 --> 00:06:00.150
he'd never thought of false papers.

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:03.150
But it was he who went to meet a man from the Resistance.

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:05.650
In those times documents had hard covers,

00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:07.150
they were filled in by hand,

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:10.150
and they stated your job.

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:12.350
In order to survive, he needed

00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:14.350
to be working. He asked the man

00:06:14.350 --> 00:06:16.150
to write "dyer."

00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:19.150
Suddenly the man looked very, very interested.

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:22.350
As a "dyer," do you know how to bleach ink marks?

00:06:22.350 --> 00:06:24.650
Of course he knew.

00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:26.450
And suddenly the man started explaining that

00:06:26.450 --> 00:06:29.150
actually the whole Resistance had a huge problem:

00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:31.750
even the top experts

00:06:31.750 --> 00:06:35.350
could not manage to bleach an ink, called "indelible,"

00:06:35.350 --> 00:06:37.550
the "Waterman" blue ink.

00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:41.450
And my father immediately replied that he knew exactly

00:06:41.450 --> 00:06:42.650
how to bleach it.

00:06:42.650 --> 00:06:45.850
Now, of course, the man was very impressed with this young man of 17

00:06:45.850 --> 00:06:49.650
who could immediately give him the formula, so he recruited him.

00:06:49.650 --> 00:06:52.650
And actually, without knowing it, my father had invented something

00:06:52.650 --> 00:06:55.300
we can find in every schoolchild's pencil case:

00:06:55.300 --> 00:06:58.150
the so-called "correction pen."

00:06:58.650 --> 00:07:03.650
(Applause)

00:07:04.150 --> 00:07:05.550
But it was only the beginning.

00:07:05.550 --> 00:07:07.150
That's my father.

00:07:07.150 --> 00:07:08.650
As soon as he got to the lab,

00:07:08.650 --> 00:07:10.050
even though he was the youngest,

00:07:10.050 --> 00:07:12.950
he immediately saw that there was a problem with the making of forged documents.

00:07:12.950 --> 00:07:15.850
All the movements stopped at falsifying.

00:07:15.850 --> 00:07:18.450
But demand was ever-growing

00:07:18.450 --> 00:07:21.050
and it was difficult to tamper with existing documents.

00:07:21.050 --> 00:07:22.550
He told himself it was necessary to make them from scratch.

00:07:22.550 --> 00:07:25.350
He started a press. He started photoengraving.

00:07:25.350 --> 00:07:26.950
He started making rubber stamps.

00:07:26.950 --> 00:07:28.750
He started inventing all kind of things --

00:07:28.750 --> 00:07:32.150
with some materials he invented a centrifuge using a bicycle wheel.

00:07:32.150 --> 00:07:34.150
Anyway, he had to do all this

00:07:34.150 --> 00:07:36.950
because he was completely obsessed with output.

00:07:36.950 --> 00:07:39.150
He had made a simple calculation:

00:07:39.150 --> 00:07:42.250
In one hour he could make 30 forged documents.

00:07:42.250 --> 00:07:46.650
If he slept one hour, 30 people would die.

00:07:46.650 --> 00:07:49.650
This sense of

00:07:49.650 --> 00:07:52.850
responsibility for other people's lives when he was just 17 --

00:07:52.850 --> 00:07:55.850
and also his guilt for being a survivor,

00:07:55.850 --> 00:07:59.450
since he had escaped the camp when his friends had not --

00:07:59.450 --> 00:08:01.702
stayed with him all his life.

00:08:01.703 --> 00:08:04.620
And this is maybe what explains why, for 30 years,

00:08:04.621 --> 00:08:07.250
he continued to make false papers

00:08:07.250 --> 00:08:09.550
at the expense of all kinds of sacrifices.

00:08:09.550 --> 00:08:10.450
I'd like to talk about those sacrifices,

00:08:10.450 --> 00:08:12.350
because there were many.

00:08:12.350 --> 00:08:14.850
There were obviously financial sacrifices

00:08:14.850 --> 00:08:16.650
because he always refused to be paid.

00:08:16.650 --> 00:08:19.350
To him, being paid would have meant being a mercenary.

00:08:19.350 --> 00:08:20.950
If he had accepted payment,

00:08:20.950 --> 00:08:22.750
he wouldn't be able to say "yes" or "no"

00:08:22.750 --> 00:08:25.150
depending on what he deemed a just or unjust cause.

00:08:25.150 --> 00:08:27.050
So he was a photographer by day,

00:08:27.050 --> 00:08:28.650
and a forger by night for 30 years.

00:08:28.650 --> 00:08:30.650
He was broke all of the time.

00:08:30.650 --> 00:08:33.650
Then there were the emotional sacrifices:

00:08:33.650 --> 00:08:36.650
How can one live with a woman while having so many secrets?

00:08:36.650 --> 00:08:40.850
How can one explain what one does at night in the lab, every single night?

00:08:40.850 --> 00:08:44.150
Of course, there was another kind of sacrifice

00:08:44.150 --> 00:08:47.550
involving his family that I understood much later.

00:08:47.550 --> 00:08:50.650
One day my father introduced me to my sister.

00:08:50.650 --> 00:08:54.650
He also explained to me that I had a brother, too,

00:08:54.650 --> 00:09:00.650
and the first time I saw them I must have been three or four,

00:09:00.650 --> 00:09:02.450
and they were 30 years older than me.

00:09:02.450 --> 00:09:07.950
They are both in their sixties now.

00:09:07.950 --> 00:09:10.650
In order to write the book,

00:09:10.650 --> 00:09:14.150
I asked my sister questions. I wanted to know who my father was,

00:09:14.150 --> 00:09:15.650
who was the father she had known.

00:09:15.650 --> 00:09:19.750
She explained that the father that she'd had

00:09:19.750 --> 00:09:23.950
would tell them he'd come and pick them up on Sunday to go for a walk.

00:09:23.950 --> 00:09:26.550
They would get all dressed up and wait for him,

00:09:26.550 --> 00:09:28.350
but he would almost never come.

00:09:28.350 --> 00:09:31.650
He'd say, "I'll call." He wouldn't call.

00:09:31.650 --> 00:09:33.650
And then he would not come.

00:09:33.650 --> 00:09:36.950
Then one day he totally disappeared.

00:09:36.950 --> 00:09:38.350
Time passed,

00:09:38.350 --> 00:09:41.550
and they thought he had surely forgotten them,

00:09:41.550 --> 00:09:43.150
at first.

00:09:43.150 --> 00:09:44.650
Then as time passed,

00:09:44.650 --> 00:09:46.650
at the end of almost two years, they thought,

00:09:46.650 --> 00:09:49.850
"Well, perhaps our father has died."

00:09:49.850 --> 00:09:52.150
And then I understood

00:09:52.150 --> 00:09:55.050
that asking my father so many questions

00:09:55.050 --> 00:09:57.850
was stirring up a whole past he probably didn't feel like talking about

00:09:57.850 --> 00:09:59.450
because it was painful.

00:09:59.450 --> 00:10:04.150
And while my half brother and sister thought they'd been abandoned,

00:10:04.150 --> 00:10:05.850
orphaned,

00:10:05.850 --> 00:10:08.150
my father was making false papers.

00:10:08.150 --> 00:10:11.650
And if he did not tell them, it was of course to protect them.

00:10:11.650 --> 00:10:13.450
After the liberation he made false papers

00:10:13.450 --> 00:10:16.350
to allow the survivors of concentration camps to immigrate to Palestine

00:10:16.350 --> 00:10:18.250
before the creation of Israel.

00:10:18.250 --> 00:10:20.650
And then, as he was a staunch anti-colonialist,

00:10:20.650 --> 00:10:24.150
he made false papers for Algerians during the Algerian war.

00:10:24.150 --> 00:10:26.750
After the Algerian war,

00:10:26.750 --> 00:10:29.350
at the heart of the international resistance movements,

00:10:29.350 --> 00:10:31.050
his name circulated

00:10:31.050 --> 00:10:33.350
and the whole world came knocking at his door.

00:10:33.350 --> 00:10:36.850
In Africa there were countries fighting for their independence:

00:10:36.850 --> 00:10:39.850
Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Angola.

00:10:39.850 --> 00:10:44.350
And then my father connected with Nelson Mandela's anti-apartheid party.

00:10:44.350 --> 00:10:47.850
He made false papers for persecuted black South Africans.

00:10:47.850 --> 00:10:49.650
There was also Latin America.

00:10:49.650 --> 00:10:52.350
My father helped those who resisted dictatorships

00:10:52.350 --> 00:10:54.250
in the Dominican Republic, Haiti,

00:10:54.250 --> 00:11:00.350
and then it was the turn of Brazil, Argentina, Venezuela, El Salvador, Nicaragua,

00:11:00.350 --> 00:11:05.950
Colombia, Peru, Uruguay, Chile and Mexico.

00:11:05.950 --> 00:11:07.650
Then there was the Vietnam War.

00:11:07.650 --> 00:11:09.950
My father made false papers for the American deserters

00:11:09.950 --> 00:11:13.150
who did not wish to take up arms against the Vietnamese.

00:11:13.150 --> 00:11:15.150
Europe was not spared either.

00:11:15.150 --> 00:11:17.291
My father made false papers for the dissidents

00:11:17.292 --> 00:11:21.050
against Franco in Spain, Salazar in Portugal,

00:11:21.050 --> 00:11:26.042
against the colonels' dictatorship in Greece,

00:11:26.043 --> 00:11:27.750
and even in France.

00:11:27.750 --> 00:11:30.904
There, just once, it happened in May of 1968.

00:11:30.905 --> 00:11:33.550
My father watched, benevolently, of course,

00:11:33.550 --> 00:11:36.350
the demonstrations of the month of May,

00:11:36.350 --> 00:11:38.650
but his heart was elsewhere, and so was his time

00:11:38.650 --> 00:11:42.150
because he had over 15 countries to serve.

00:11:42.150 --> 00:11:44.518
Once, though, he agreed to make false papers

00:11:44.519 --> 00:11:46.462
for someone you might recognize.

00:11:46.463 --> 00:11:49.379
(Laughter)

00:11:49.380 --> 00:11:51.000
He was much younger in those days,

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.150
and my father agreed to make false papers

00:11:53.150 --> 00:11:56.186
to enable him to come back and speak at a meeting.

00:11:56.187 --> 00:12:01.150
He told me that those false papers were the most media-relevant

00:12:01.150 --> 00:12:04.650
and the least useful he'd had to make in all his life.

00:12:04.650 --> 00:12:06.150
But, he agreed to do it,

00:12:06.150 --> 00:12:09.550
even though Daniel Cohn-Bendit's life was not in danger,

00:12:09.550 --> 00:12:11.744
just because

00:12:11.745 --> 00:12:13.150
it was a good opportunity

00:12:13.150 --> 00:12:15.634
to mock the authorities,

00:12:15.635 --> 00:12:18.650
and to show them that there's nothing more porous than borders --

00:12:18.650 --> 00:12:23.150
and that ideas have no borders.

00:12:23.150 --> 00:12:25.150
All my childhood,

00:12:25.150 --> 00:12:29.247
while my friends' dads would tell them Grimm's fairy tales,

00:12:29.248 --> 00:12:33.137
my father would tell me stories about very unassuming heroes

00:12:33.138 --> 00:12:36.054
with unshakeable utopias

00:12:36.055 --> 00:12:38.971
who managed to make miracles.

00:12:38.972 --> 00:12:42.950
And those heroes did not need an army behind them.

00:12:42.950 --> 00:12:45.450
Anyhow, nobody would have followed them,

00:12:45.450 --> 00:12:48.695
except for a handful [of] men and women of conviction and courage.

00:12:48.696 --> 00:12:49.950
I understood much later

00:12:49.950 --> 00:12:53.557
that actually it was his own story my father would tell me to get me to sleep.

00:12:53.558 --> 00:12:56.474
I asked him whether, considering the sacrifices he had to make,

00:12:56.475 --> 00:12:58.419
he ever had any regrets.

00:12:58.420 --> 00:13:00.150
He said no.

00:13:00.150 --> 00:13:02.309
He told me that he would have been unable

00:13:02.310 --> 00:13:05.226
to witness or submit to injustice without doing anything.

00:13:05.227 --> 00:13:08.250
He was persuaded, and he's still convinced

00:13:08.250 --> 00:13:10.450
that another world is possible --

00:13:10.450 --> 00:13:13.450
a world where no one would ever need a forger.

00:13:13.450 --> 00:13:15.450
He's still dreaming about it.

00:13:15.450 --> 00:13:16.894
My father

00:13:16.895 --> 00:13:18.650
is here in the room today.

00:13:18.650 --> 00:13:22.729
His name is Adolfo Kaminsky and I'm going to ask him to stand up.

00:13:22.730 --> 00:13:43.149
(Applause)

00:13:43.150 --> 00:13:46.150
Thank you.
