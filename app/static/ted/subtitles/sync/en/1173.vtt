00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:39.150
(Music)

00:07:01.150 --> 00:07:23.150
(Applause)

00:07:24.150 --> 00:07:26.150
Thank you.

00:07:26.150 --> 00:07:29.150
Imagining a solo cello concert,

00:07:29.150 --> 00:07:32.150
one would most likely think of Johann Sebastian Bach

00:07:32.150 --> 00:07:35.150
unaccompanied cello suites.

00:07:35.150 --> 00:07:37.150
As a child

00:07:37.150 --> 00:07:40.150
studying these eternal masterpieces,

00:07:40.150 --> 00:07:42.150
Bach's music would intermingle

00:07:42.150 --> 00:07:45.150
with the singing voices of Muslim prayers

00:07:45.150 --> 00:07:47.150
from the neighboring Arab village

00:07:47.150 --> 00:07:49.150
of the northern Kibbutz in Israel

00:07:49.150 --> 00:07:51.150
where I grew up.

00:07:51.150 --> 00:07:53.150
Late at night, after hours of practicing,

00:07:53.150 --> 00:07:56.150
I would listen to Janis Joplin and Billie Holiday

00:07:56.150 --> 00:07:58.150
as the sounds of tango music

00:07:58.150 --> 00:08:01.150
would be creeping from my parents' stereo.

00:08:01.150 --> 00:08:04.150
It all became music to me.

00:08:04.150 --> 00:08:07.150
I didn't hear the boundaries.

00:08:07.150 --> 00:08:09.150
I still start every day

00:08:09.150 --> 00:08:11.150
practicing playing Bach.

00:08:11.150 --> 00:08:13.150
His music never ceases

00:08:13.150 --> 00:08:15.150
to sound fresh and surprising to me.

00:08:15.150 --> 00:08:17.150
But as I was moving away

00:08:17.150 --> 00:08:19.150
from the traditional classical repertoire

00:08:19.150 --> 00:08:21.150
and trying to find new ways

00:08:21.150 --> 00:08:23.150
of musical expression,

00:08:23.150 --> 00:08:26.150
I realized that with today's technological resources,

00:08:26.150 --> 00:08:28.150
there's no reason to limit

00:08:28.150 --> 00:08:31.150
what can be produced at one time

00:08:31.150 --> 00:08:33.150
from a single string instrument.

00:08:33.150 --> 00:08:35.150
The power and coherency

00:08:35.150 --> 00:08:39.150
that comes from one person hearing, perceiving and playing all the voices

00:08:39.150 --> 00:08:42.150
makes a very different experience.

00:08:42.150 --> 00:08:45.150
The excitement of a great orchestra performance

00:08:45.150 --> 00:08:48.150
comes from the attempt to have a collective of musicians

00:08:48.150 --> 00:08:51.150
producing one unified whole concept.

00:08:51.150 --> 00:08:54.150
The excitement from using multi-tracking,

00:08:54.150 --> 00:08:58.150
the way I did in the piece you will hear next,

00:08:58.150 --> 00:09:00.150
comes from the attempt

00:09:00.150 --> 00:09:03.150
to build and create a whole universe

00:09:03.150 --> 00:09:06.150
with many diverse layers,

00:09:06.150 --> 00:09:09.150
all generated from a single source.

00:09:09.150 --> 00:09:11.150
My cello and my voice are layered

00:09:11.150 --> 00:09:14.150
to create this large sonic canvas.

00:09:14.150 --> 00:09:17.150
When composers write music for me,

00:09:17.150 --> 00:09:19.150
I ask them to forget what they know about the cello.

00:09:19.150 --> 00:09:22.150
I hope to arrive at new territories

00:09:22.150 --> 00:09:25.150
to discover sounds I have never heard before.

00:09:25.150 --> 00:09:27.150
I want to create endless possibilities

00:09:27.150 --> 00:09:29.150
with this cello.

00:09:29.150 --> 00:09:32.150
I become the medium through which the music is being channeled,

00:09:32.150 --> 00:09:35.150
and in the process, when all is right,

00:09:35.150 --> 00:09:37.150
the music is transformed

00:09:37.150 --> 00:09:39.150
and so am I.

00:09:46.150 --> 00:09:56.150
(Music)

00:19:56.150 --> 00:20:20.150
(Applause)
