00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:19.150
Has anyone ever been to Aspen, Colorado?

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:20.150
It's not a joke yet;

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:23.150
those aren't the jokes.

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:25.150
Is this thing off?

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:33.150
I went to Aspen recently

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:37.150
and stumbled into this song.

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:44.150
♫ Black men go to Aspen ♫

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:48.150
♫ and rent colorful chalets. ♫

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:55.150
♫ Giggle at the questions ♫

00:00:55.150 --> 00:01:00.150
♫ their mere presence seems to raise. ♫

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:07.150
♫ Get taken for men ♫

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:12.150
♫ we don't resemble in the least. ♫

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.150
"Are you ... ?"

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:16.150
"No."

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:19.150
♫ It's a winter wonderland ♫

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:22.150
♫ in the belly of the beast. ♫

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:27.150
♫ And black men ski. ♫

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:33.150
♫ Black men ski. ♫

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:36.150
♫ Black men send back sushi ♫

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:41.150
♫ with a scorned Yakuza's flair. ♫

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:47.150
♫ We make postmodern art ♫

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:49.150
♫ with bacon grease ♫

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:52.150
♫ and hot combed hair. ♫

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:00.150
♫ We secretly play Beethoven ♫

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:03.150
♫ inside our bassmobiles. ♫

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:11.150
♫ We can tell you how cool looks ♫

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:14.150
♫ but cannot show you how it feels ♫

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:18.150
♫ when black men ski. ♫

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:26.150
♫ When black men ski. ♫

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:28.150
♫ Black men now are students ♫

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:31.150
♫ of gay sensibility. ♫

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:34.150
♫ We wear ironic T-shirts ♫

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:37.150
♫ drenched in code unknown to thee. ♫

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:40.150
♫ We get baptized in Walden Pond ♫

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:42.150
♫ amongst a searing mob ♫

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:45.150
♫ because the cleansing blood of Jesus ♫

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:48.150
♫ could not do a thorough job. ♫

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:52.150
♫ Black men ski. ♫

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:57.150
♫ Black men ski. ♫

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:02.150
♫ Chinese guys can jump real high ♫

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:05.150
♫ and Germans cook soul food. ♫

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:08.150
♫ White boys rap and hippies nap ♫

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:10.150
♫ their dreads up to look rude. ♫

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:13.150
♫ Jazz is now suburban ♫

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:16.150
♫ it's Marsalisly clean. ♫

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:19.150
♫ And now we've got Viagra ♫

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:21.150
♫ everyone's a sex machine. ♫

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:26.150
♫ So black men ski. ♫

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:27.150
What else can we do?

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:31.150
♫ Black men ski. ♫

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:37.150
♫ Black men ski. ♫

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:43.150
♫ Black men ski. ♫

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:47.150
♫ Some kids I'll describe as friends ♫

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:50.150
♫ say I am race-obsessed. ♫

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:52.150
♫ The luxury of your opinion ♫

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:55.150
♫ shows that you are blessed. ♫

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:58.150
♫ See, I have poems about sunsets ♫

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:01.150
♫ flowers and the rain. ♫

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:04.150
♫ I've read them to policemen ♫

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:06.150
♫ but it was all in vain. ♫

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:10.150
♫ So black men ski. ♫

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:16.150
♫ Black men ski ... ♫

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:17.150
elegantly.

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:22.150
♫ Black men ski. ♫

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:31.150
♫ Black men ski. ♫
