00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:14.150
By the end of this year,

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:17.150
there'll be nearly a billion people on this planet

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:19.150
that actively use social networking sites.

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:21.150
The one thing that all of them have in common

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.150
is that they're going to die.

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.150
While that might be a somewhat morbid thought,

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.150
I think it has some really profound implications

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:31.150
that are worth exploring.

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:34.150
What first got me thinking about this

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:37.150
was a blog post authored earlier this year by Derek K. Miller,

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:40.150
who was a science and technology journalist

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:42.150
who died of cancer.

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:45.150
And what Miller did was have his family and friends write a post

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:47.150
that went out shortly after he died.

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:49.150
Here's what he wrote in starting that out.

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:51.150
He said, "Here it is. I'm dead,

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:53.150
and this is my last post to my blog.

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:56.150
In advance, I asked that once my body finally shut down

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:58.150
from the punishments of my cancer,

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:01.150
then my family and friends publish this prepared message I wrote --

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:03.150
the first part of the process

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:06.150
of turning this from an active website to an archive."

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.150
Now, while as a journalist,

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:10.150
Miller's archive may have been better written

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:12.150
and more carefully curated than most,

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.150
the fact of the matter is that all of us today

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:16.150
are creating an archive

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:18.150
that's something completely different

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.150
than anything that's been created

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:22.150
by any previous generation.

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:24.150
Consider a few stats for a moment.

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.150
Right now there are 48 hours of video

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:29.150
being uploaded to YouTube every single minute.

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:33.150
There are 200 million Tweets being posted every day.

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:36.150
And the average Facebook user

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:40.150
is creating 90 pieces of content each month.

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:43.150
So when you think about your parents or your grandparents,

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:45.150
at best they may have created

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:47.150
some photos or home videos,

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:50.150
or a diary that lives in a box somewhere.

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:53.150
But today we're all creating this incredibly rich digital archive

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:55.150
that's going to live in the cloud indefinitely,

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:57.150
years after we're gone.

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:00.150
And I think that's going to create some incredibly intriguing opportunities

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:02.150
for technologists.

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:04.150
Now to be clear, I'm a journalist and not a technologist,

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:06.150
so what I'd like to do briefly

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:08.150
is paint a picture

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:11.150
of what the present and the future are going to look like.

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:13.150
Now we're already seeing some services

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:15.150
that are designed to let us decide

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:18.150
what happens to our online profile and our social media accounts

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:20.150
after we die.

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:22.150
One of them actually, fittingly enough,

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:24.150
found me when I checked into a deli

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:26.150
at a restaurant in New York

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:29.150
on foursquare.

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:31.150
(Recording) Adam Ostrow: Hello.

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:33.150
Death: Adam?

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:35.150
AO: Yeah.

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:38.150
Death: Death can catch you anywhere, anytime,

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:41.150
even at the Organic.

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:43.150
AO: Who is this?

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:46.150
Death: Go to ifidie.net

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:48.150
before it's too late.

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:50.150
(Laughter)

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:52.150
Adam Ostrow: Kind of creepy, right?

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:54.150
So what that service does, quite simply,

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:56.150
is let you create a message or a video

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:59.150
that can be posted to Facebook after you die.

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:01.150
Another service right now

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:03.150
is called 1,000 Memories.

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:05.150
And what this lets you do is create an online tribute to your loved ones,

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:08.150
complete with photos and videos and stories

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:11.150
that they can post after you die.

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:14.150
But what I think comes next is far more interesting.

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:17.150
Now a lot of you are probably familiar with Deb Roy

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:19.150
who, back in March,

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:23.150
demonstrated how he was able to analyze more than 90,000 hours of home video.

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:25.150
I think as machines' ability

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:27.150
to understand human language and process vast amounts of data

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:29.150
continues to improve,

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:31.150
it's going to become possible

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:33.150
to analyze an entire life's worth of content --

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:36.150
the Tweets, the photos, the videos, the blog posts --

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:38.150
that we're producing in such massive numbers.

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:40.150
And I think as that happens,

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:43.150
it's going to become possible for our digital personas

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:46.150
to continue to interact in the real world long after we're gone

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:49.150
thanks to the vastness of the amount of content we're creating

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:52.150
and technology's ability to make sense of it all.

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:55.150
Now we're already starting to see some experiments here.

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:57.150
One service called My Next Tweet

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:00.150
analyzes your entire Twitter stream, everything you've posted onto Twitter,

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:03.150
to make some predictions as to what you might say next.

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:05.150
Well right now, as you can see,

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:07.150
the results can be somewhat comical.

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:09.150
You can imagine what something like this might look like

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:11.150
five, 10 or 20 years from now

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:14.150
as our technical capabilities improve.

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:16.150
Taking it a step further,

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:18.150
MIT's media lab is working on robots

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:21.150
that can interact more like humans.

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:23.150
But what if those robots were able to interact

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:26.150
based on the unique characteristics of a specific person

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:28.150
based on the hundreds of thousands of pieces of content

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:31.150
that person produces in their lifetime?

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:33.150
Finally, think back to this famous scene

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:35.150
from election night 2008

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:37.150
back in the United States,

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:39.150
where CNN beamed a live hologram

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:41.150
of hip hop artist will.i.am into their studio

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:44.150
for an interview with Anderson Cooper.

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:46.150
What if we were able to use that same type of technology

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:50.150
to beam a representation of our loved ones into our living rooms --

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:52.150
interacting in a very lifelike way

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:55.150
based on all the content they created while they were alive?

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:58.150
I think that's going to become completely possible

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:00.150
as the amount of data we're producing

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:02.150
and technology's ability to understand it

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:05.150
both expand exponentially.

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:07.150
Now in closing, I think what we all need to be thinking about

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:09.150
is if we want that to become our reality --

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:11.150
and if so,

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:14.150
what it means for a definition of life and everything that comes after it.

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:16.150
Thank you very much.

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:20.150
(Applause)
