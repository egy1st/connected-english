00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:14.150
Each of you possesses

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:17.150
the most powerful, dangerous and subversive trait

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:20.150
that natural selection has ever devised.

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:23.150
It's a piece of neural audio technology

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:25.150
for rewiring other people's minds.

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:28.150
I'm talking about your language, of course,

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:31.150
because it allows you to implant a thought from your mind

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:34.150
directly into someone else's mind,

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:36.150
and they can attempt to do the same to you,

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:39.150
without either of you having to perform surgery.

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:41.150
Instead, when you speak,

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:43.150
you're actually using a form of telemetry

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:45.150
not so different

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:47.150
from the remote control device for your television.

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:49.150
It's just that, whereas that device

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:51.150
relies on pulses of infrared light,

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:54.150
your language relies on pulses,

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:56.150
discrete pulses, of sound.

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:59.150
And just as you use the remote control device

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:01.150
to alter the internal settings of your television

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:03.150
to suit your mood,

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:05.150
you use your language

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:07.150
to alter the settings inside someone else's brain

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:09.150
to suit your interests.

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.150
Languages are genes talking,

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:13.150
getting things that they want.

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:16.150
And just imagine the sense of wonder in a baby

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:19.150
when it first discovers that, merely by uttering a sound,

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:21.150
it can get objects to move across a room

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.150
as if by magic,

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:26.150
and maybe even into its mouth.

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:28.150
Now language's subversive power

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:30.150
has been recognized throughout the ages

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.150
in censorship, in books you can't read,

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:34.150
phrases you can't use

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:36.150
and words you can't say.

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:39.150
In fact, the Tower of Babel story in the Bible

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.150
is a fable and warning

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:43.150
about the power of language.

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:46.150
According to that story, early humans developed the conceit

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:48.150
that, by using their language to work together,

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:50.150
they could build a tower

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:52.150
that would take them all the way to heaven.

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:55.150
Now God, angered at this attempt to usurp his power,

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:58.150
destroyed the tower,

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:00.150
and then to ensure

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:02.150
that it would never be rebuilt,

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:05.150
he scattered the people by giving them different languages --

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:08.150
confused them by giving them different languages.

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:10.150
And this leads to the wonderful irony

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:13.150
that our languages exist to prevent us from communicating.

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:15.150
Even today,

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:17.150
we know that there are words we cannot use,

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:19.150
phrases we cannot say,

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:21.150
because if we do so,

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:24.150
we might be accosted, jailed,

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:26.150
or even killed.

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:28.150
And all of this from a puff of air

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:30.150
emanating from our mouths.

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:33.150
Now all this fuss about a single one of our traits

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:35.150
tells us there's something worth explaining.

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:37.150
And that is how and why

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:39.150
did this remarkable trait evolve,

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:41.150
and why did it evolve

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:43.150
only in our species?

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:45.150
Now it's a little bit of a surprise

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:47.150
that to get an answer to that question,

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:49.150
we have to go to tool use

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:51.150
in the chimpanzees.

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:53.150
Now these chimpanzees are using tools,

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:56.150
and we take that as a sign of their intelligence.

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:58.150
But if they really were intelligent,

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:01.150
why would they use a stick to extract termites from the ground

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:03.150
rather than a shovel?

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:06.150
And if they really were intelligent,

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:08.150
why would they crack open nuts with a rock?

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:11.150
Why wouldn't they just go to a shop and buy a bag of nuts

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:14.150
that somebody else had already cracked open for them?

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:16.150
Why not? I mean, that's what we do.

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:18.150
Now the reason the chimpanzees don't do that

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:21.150
is that they lack what psychologists and anthropologists call

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:23.150
social learning.

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:25.150
They seem to lack the ability

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:27.150
to learn from others

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:29.150
by copying or imitating

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:31.150
or simply watching.

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:33.150
As a result,

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:35.150
they can't improve on others' ideas

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:37.150
or learn from others' mistakes --

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:39.150
benefit from others' wisdom.

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:41.150
And so they just do the same thing

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:43.150
over and over and over again.

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:47.150
In fact, we could go away for a million years and come back

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:50.150
and these chimpanzees would be doing the same thing

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:52.150
with the same sticks for the termites

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:55.150
and the same rocks to crack open the nuts.

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:58.150
Now this may sound arrogant, or even full of hubris.

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:00.150
How do we know this?

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:03.150
Because this is exactly what our ancestors, the Homo erectus, did.

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:05.150
These upright apes

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:07.150
evolved on the African savanna

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:09.150
about two million years ago,

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:11.150
and they made these splendid hand axes

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:13.150
that fit wonderfully into your hands.

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:15.150
But if we look at the fossil record,

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:18.150
we see that they made the same hand axe

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:20.150
over and over and over again

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:22.150
for one million years.

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:24.150
You can follow it through the fossil record.

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:26.150
Now if we make some guesses about how long Homo erectus lived,

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:28.150
what their generation time was,

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:31.150
that's about 40,000 generations

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:34.150
of parents to offspring, and other individuals watching,

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:36.150
in which that hand axe didn't change.

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:38.150
It's not even clear

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:40.150
that our very close genetic relatives, the Neanderthals,

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:42.150
had social learning.

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:45.150
Sure enough, their tools were more complicated

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:47.150
than those of Homo erectus,

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:49.150
but they too showed very little change

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:52.150
over the 300,000 years or so

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:54.150
that those species, the Neanderthals,

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:56.150
lived in Eurasia.

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:58.150
Okay, so what this tells us

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:01.150
is that, contrary to the old adage,

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:04.150
"monkey see, monkey do,"

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:06.150
the surprise really is

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:08.150
that all of the other animals

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:11.150
really cannot do that -- at least not very much.

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:13.150
And even this picture

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:16.150
has the suspicious taint of being rigged about it --

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:18.150
something from a Barnum &amp; Bailey circus.

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:20.150
But by comparison,

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:22.150
we can learn.

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:25.150
We can learn by watching other people

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:27.150
and copying or imitating

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:29.150
what they can do.

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:32.150
We can then choose, from among a range of options,

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:34.150
the best one.

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:36.150
We can benefit from others' ideas.

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:38.150
We can build on their wisdom.

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:41.150
And as a result, our ideas do accumulate,

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:45.150
and our technology progresses.

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:50.150
And this cumulative cultural adaptation,

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:52.150
as anthropologists call

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:54.150
this accumulation of ideas,

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:56.150
is responsible for everything around you

00:05:56.150 --> 00:05:58.150
in your bustling and teeming everyday lives.

00:05:58.150 --> 00:06:00.150
I mean the world has changed out of all proportion

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:02.150
to what we would recognize

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:05.150
even 1,000 or 2,000 years ago.

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:08.150
And all of this because of cumulative cultural adaptation.

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:10.150
The chairs you're sitting in, the lights in this auditorium,

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:13.150
my microphone, the iPads and iPods that you carry around with you --

00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:15.150
all are a result

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:17.150
of cumulative cultural adaptation.

00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:21.150
Now to many commentators,

00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:24.150
cumulative cultural adaptation, or social learning,

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:27.150
is job done, end of story.

00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:30.150
Our species can make stuff,

00:06:30.150 --> 00:06:33.150
therefore we prospered in a way that no other species has.

00:06:33.150 --> 00:06:36.150
In fact, we can even make the "stuff of life" --

00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:38.150
as I just said, all the stuff around us.

00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:40.150
But in fact, it turns out

00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:43.150
that some time around 200,000 years ago,

00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:45.150
when our species first arose

00:06:45.150 --> 00:06:47.150
and acquired social learning,

00:06:47.150 --> 00:06:49.150
that this was really the beginning of our story,

00:06:49.150 --> 00:06:51.150
not the end of our story.

00:06:51.150 --> 00:06:54.150
Because our acquisition of social learning

00:06:54.150 --> 00:06:57.150
would create a social and evolutionary dilemma,

00:06:57.150 --> 00:07:00.150
the resolution of which, it's fair to say,

00:07:00.150 --> 00:07:04.150
would determine not only the future course of our psychology,

00:07:04.150 --> 00:07:06.150
but the future course of the entire world.

00:07:06.150 --> 00:07:09.150
And most importantly for this,

00:07:09.150 --> 00:07:12.150
it'll tell us why we have language.

00:07:12.150 --> 00:07:14.150
And the reason that dilemma arose

00:07:14.150 --> 00:07:17.150
is, it turns out, that social learning is visual theft.

00:07:17.150 --> 00:07:20.150
If I can learn by watching you,

00:07:20.150 --> 00:07:22.150
I can steal your best ideas,

00:07:22.150 --> 00:07:25.150
and I can benefit from your efforts,

00:07:25.150 --> 00:07:27.150
without having to put in the time and energy that you did

00:07:27.150 --> 00:07:29.150
into developing them.

00:07:29.150 --> 00:07:32.150
If I can watch which lure you use to catch a fish,

00:07:32.150 --> 00:07:34.150
or I can watch how you flake your hand axe

00:07:34.150 --> 00:07:36.150
to make it better,

00:07:36.150 --> 00:07:39.150
or if I follow you secretly to your mushroom patch,

00:07:39.150 --> 00:07:42.150
I can benefit from your knowledge and wisdom and skills,

00:07:42.150 --> 00:07:44.150
and maybe even catch that fish

00:07:44.150 --> 00:07:46.150
before you do.

00:07:46.150 --> 00:07:49.150
Social learning really is visual theft.

00:07:49.150 --> 00:07:51.150
And in any species that acquired it,

00:07:51.150 --> 00:07:53.150
it would behoove you

00:07:53.150 --> 00:07:55.150
to hide your best ideas,

00:07:55.150 --> 00:07:58.150
lest somebody steal them from you.

00:07:59.150 --> 00:08:02.150
And so some time around 200,000 years ago,

00:08:02.150 --> 00:08:05.150
our species confronted this crisis.

00:08:05.150 --> 00:08:08.150
And we really had only two options

00:08:08.150 --> 00:08:10.150
for dealing with the conflicts

00:08:10.150 --> 00:08:12.150
that visual theft would bring.

00:08:12.150 --> 00:08:14.150
One of those options

00:08:14.150 --> 00:08:17.150
was that we could have retreated

00:08:17.150 --> 00:08:19.150
into small family groups.

00:08:19.150 --> 00:08:22.150
Because then the benefits of our ideas and knowledge

00:08:22.150 --> 00:08:24.150
would flow just to our relatives.

00:08:24.150 --> 00:08:26.150
Had we chosen this option,

00:08:26.150 --> 00:08:29.150
sometime around 200,000 years ago,

00:08:29.150 --> 00:08:32.150
we would probably still be living like the Neanderthals were

00:08:32.150 --> 00:08:35.150
when we first entered Europe 40,000 years ago.

00:08:35.150 --> 00:08:37.150
And this is because in small groups

00:08:37.150 --> 00:08:40.150
there are fewer ideas, there are fewer innovations.

00:08:40.150 --> 00:08:43.150
And small groups are more prone to accidents and bad luck.

00:08:43.150 --> 00:08:45.150
So if we'd chosen that path,

00:08:45.150 --> 00:08:48.150
our evolutionary path would have led into the forest --

00:08:48.150 --> 00:08:50.150
and been a short one indeed.

00:08:50.150 --> 00:08:52.150
The other option we could choose

00:08:52.150 --> 00:08:55.150
was to develop the systems of communication

00:08:55.150 --> 00:08:57.150
that would allow us to share ideas

00:08:57.150 --> 00:09:00.150
and to cooperate amongst others.

00:09:00.150 --> 00:09:02.150
Choosing this option would mean

00:09:02.150 --> 00:09:05.150
that a vastly greater fund of accumulated knowledge and wisdom

00:09:05.150 --> 00:09:08.150
would become available to any one individual

00:09:08.150 --> 00:09:11.150
than would ever arise from within an individual family

00:09:11.150 --> 00:09:14.150
or an individual person on their own.

00:09:15.150 --> 00:09:18.150
Well, we chose the second option,

00:09:18.150 --> 00:09:21.150
and language is the result.

00:09:21.150 --> 00:09:23.150
Language evolved to solve the crisis

00:09:23.150 --> 00:09:25.150
of visual theft.

00:09:25.150 --> 00:09:28.150
Language is a piece of social technology

00:09:28.150 --> 00:09:31.150
for enhancing the benefits of cooperation --

00:09:31.150 --> 00:09:34.150
for reaching agreements, for striking deals

00:09:34.150 --> 00:09:38.150
and for coordinating our activities.

00:09:38.150 --> 00:09:40.150
And you can see that, in a developing society

00:09:40.150 --> 00:09:42.150
that was beginning to acquire language,

00:09:42.150 --> 00:09:44.150
not having language

00:09:44.150 --> 00:09:46.150
would be a like a bird without wings.

00:09:46.150 --> 00:09:49.150
Just as wings open up this sphere of air

00:09:49.150 --> 00:09:51.150
for birds to exploit,

00:09:51.150 --> 00:09:53.150
language opened up the sphere of cooperation

00:09:53.150 --> 00:09:55.150
for humans to exploit.

00:09:55.150 --> 00:09:57.150
And we take this utterly for granted,

00:09:57.150 --> 00:10:00.150
because we're a species that is so at home with language,

00:10:00.150 --> 00:10:02.150
but you have to realize

00:10:02.150 --> 00:10:05.150
that even the simplest acts of exchange that we engage in

00:10:05.150 --> 00:10:08.150
are utterly dependent upon language.

00:10:08.150 --> 00:10:10.150
And to see why, consider two scenarios

00:10:10.150 --> 00:10:12.150
from early in our evolution.

00:10:12.150 --> 00:10:14.150
Let's imagine that you are really good

00:10:14.150 --> 00:10:16.150
at making arrowheads,

00:10:16.150 --> 00:10:19.150
but you're hopeless at making the wooden shafts

00:10:19.150 --> 00:10:22.150
with the flight feathers attached.

00:10:22.150 --> 00:10:25.150
Two other people you know are very good at making the wooden shafts,

00:10:25.150 --> 00:10:28.150
but they're hopeless at making the arrowheads.

00:10:28.150 --> 00:10:30.150
So what you do is --

00:10:30.150 --> 00:10:33.150
one of those people has not really acquired language yet.

00:10:33.150 --> 00:10:35.150
And let's pretend the other one is good at language skills.

00:10:35.150 --> 00:10:38.150
So what you do one day is you take a pile of arrowheads,

00:10:38.150 --> 00:10:40.150
and you walk up to the one that can't speak very well,

00:10:40.150 --> 00:10:42.150
and you put the arrowheads down in front of him,

00:10:42.150 --> 00:10:45.150
hoping that he'll get the idea that you want to trade your arrowheads

00:10:45.150 --> 00:10:47.150
for finished arrows.

00:10:47.150 --> 00:10:49.150
But he looks at the pile of arrowheads, thinks they're a gift,

00:10:49.150 --> 00:10:52.150
picks them up, smiles and walks off.

00:10:52.150 --> 00:10:54.150
Now you pursue this guy, gesticulating.

00:10:54.150 --> 00:10:56.150
A scuffle ensues and you get stabbed

00:10:56.150 --> 00:10:59.150
with one of your own arrowheads.

00:10:59.150 --> 00:11:02.150
Okay, now replay this scene now, and you're approaching the one who has language.

00:11:02.150 --> 00:11:04.150
You put down your arrowheads and say,

00:11:04.150 --> 00:11:07.150
"I'd like to trade these arrowheads for finished arrows. I'll split you 50/50."

00:11:07.150 --> 00:11:09.150
The other one says, "Fine. Looks good to me.

00:11:09.150 --> 00:11:12.150
We'll do that."

00:11:12.150 --> 00:11:15.150
Now the job is done.

00:11:15.150 --> 00:11:17.150
Once we have language,

00:11:17.150 --> 00:11:19.150
we can put our ideas together and cooperate

00:11:19.150 --> 00:11:21.150
to have a prosperity

00:11:21.150 --> 00:11:24.150
that we couldn't have before we acquired it.

00:11:24.150 --> 00:11:26.150
And this is why our species

00:11:26.150 --> 00:11:28.150
has prospered around the world

00:11:28.150 --> 00:11:30.150
while the rest of the animals

00:11:30.150 --> 00:11:33.150
sit behind bars in zoos, languishing.

00:11:33.150 --> 00:11:36.150
That's why we build space shuttles and cathedrals

00:11:36.150 --> 00:11:38.150
while the rest of the world sticks sticks into the ground

00:11:38.150 --> 00:11:40.150
to extract termites.

00:11:40.150 --> 00:11:43.150
All right, if this view of language

00:11:43.150 --> 00:11:45.150
and its value

00:11:45.150 --> 00:11:48.150
in solving the crisis of visual theft is true,

00:11:48.150 --> 00:11:50.150
any species that acquires it

00:11:50.150 --> 00:11:53.150
should show an explosion of creativity and prosperity.

00:11:53.150 --> 00:11:56.150
And this is exactly what the archeological record shows.

00:11:56.150 --> 00:11:58.150
If you look at our ancestors,

00:11:58.150 --> 00:12:01.150
the Neanderthals and the Homo erectus, our immediate ancestors,

00:12:01.150 --> 00:12:04.150
they're confined to small regions of the world.

00:12:04.150 --> 00:12:06.150
But when our species arose

00:12:06.150 --> 00:12:08.150
about 200,000 years ago,

00:12:08.150 --> 00:12:11.150
sometime after that we quickly walked out of Africa

00:12:11.150 --> 00:12:14.150
and spread around the entire world,

00:12:14.150 --> 00:12:17.150
occupying nearly every habitat on Earth.

00:12:17.150 --> 00:12:20.150
Now whereas other species are confined

00:12:20.150 --> 00:12:23.150
to places that their genes adapt them to,

00:12:23.150 --> 00:12:25.150
with social learning and language,

00:12:25.150 --> 00:12:27.150
we could transform the environment

00:12:27.150 --> 00:12:29.150
to suit our needs.

00:12:29.150 --> 00:12:31.150
And so we prospered in a way

00:12:31.150 --> 00:12:33.150
that no other animal has.

00:12:33.150 --> 00:12:36.150
Language really is

00:12:36.150 --> 00:12:39.150
the most potent trait that has ever evolved.

00:12:39.150 --> 00:12:42.150
It is the most valuable trait we have

00:12:42.150 --> 00:12:45.150
for converting new lands and resources

00:12:45.150 --> 00:12:48.150
into more people and their genes

00:12:48.150 --> 00:12:50.150
that natural selection has ever devised.

00:12:50.150 --> 00:12:52.150
Language really is

00:12:52.150 --> 00:12:54.150
the voice of our genes.

00:12:54.150 --> 00:12:56.150
Now having evolved language, though,

00:12:56.150 --> 00:12:58.150
we did something peculiar,

00:12:58.150 --> 00:13:00.150
even bizarre.

00:13:00.150 --> 00:13:02.150
As we spread out around the world,

00:13:02.150 --> 00:13:05.150
we developed thousands of different languages.

00:13:05.150 --> 00:13:07.150
Currently, there are about seven or 8,000

00:13:07.150 --> 00:13:10.150
different languages spoken on Earth.

00:13:10.150 --> 00:13:12.150
Now you might say, well, this is just natural.

00:13:12.150 --> 00:13:15.150
As we diverge, our languages are naturally going to diverge.

00:13:15.150 --> 00:13:17.150
But the real puzzle and irony

00:13:17.150 --> 00:13:20.150
is that the greatest density of different languages on Earth

00:13:20.150 --> 00:13:24.150
is found where people are most tightly packed together.

00:13:24.150 --> 00:13:26.150
If we go to the island of Papua New Guinea,

00:13:26.150 --> 00:13:29.150
we can find about 800 to 1,000

00:13:29.150 --> 00:13:31.150
distinct human languages,

00:13:31.150 --> 00:13:33.150
different human languages,

00:13:33.150 --> 00:13:35.150
spoken on that island alone.

00:13:35.150 --> 00:13:37.150
There are places on that island

00:13:37.150 --> 00:13:39.150
where you can encounter a new language

00:13:39.150 --> 00:13:41.150
every two or three miles.

00:13:41.150 --> 00:13:43.150
Now, incredible as this sounds,

00:13:43.150 --> 00:13:46.150
I once met a Papuan man, and I asked him if this could possibly be true.

00:13:46.150 --> 00:13:48.150
And he said to me, "Oh no.

00:13:48.150 --> 00:13:51.150
They're far closer together than that."

00:13:51.150 --> 00:13:53.150
And it's true; there are places on that island

00:13:53.150 --> 00:13:56.150
where you can encounter a new language in under a mile.

00:13:56.150 --> 00:13:59.150
And this is also true of some remote oceanic islands.

00:14:00.150 --> 00:14:02.150
And so it seems that we use our language,

00:14:02.150 --> 00:14:04.150
not just to cooperate,

00:14:04.150 --> 00:14:07.150
but to draw rings around our cooperative groups

00:14:07.150 --> 00:14:09.150
and to establish identities,

00:14:09.150 --> 00:14:12.150
and perhaps to protect our knowledge and wisdom and skills

00:14:12.150 --> 00:14:15.150
from eavesdropping from outside.

00:14:15.150 --> 00:14:17.150
And we know this

00:14:17.150 --> 00:14:19.150
because when we study different language groups

00:14:19.150 --> 00:14:21.150
and associate them with their cultures,

00:14:21.150 --> 00:14:23.150
we see that different languages

00:14:23.150 --> 00:14:26.150
slow the flow of ideas between groups.

00:14:26.150 --> 00:14:29.150
They slow the flow of technologies.

00:14:29.150 --> 00:14:32.150
And they even slow the flow of genes.

00:14:32.150 --> 00:14:34.150
Now I can't speak for you,

00:14:34.150 --> 00:14:36.150
but it seems to be the case

00:14:36.150 --> 00:14:39.150
that we don't have sex with people we can't talk to.

00:14:40.150 --> 00:14:42.150
(Laughter)

00:14:42.150 --> 00:14:44.150
Now we have to counter that, though,

00:14:44.150 --> 00:14:46.150
against the evidence we've heard

00:14:46.150 --> 00:14:49.150
that we might have had some rather distasteful genetic dalliances

00:14:49.150 --> 00:14:51.150
with the Neanderthals and the Denisovans.

00:14:51.150 --> 00:14:53.150
(Laughter)

00:14:53.150 --> 00:14:55.150
Okay, this tendency we have,

00:14:55.150 --> 00:14:57.150
this seemingly natural tendency we have,

00:14:57.150 --> 00:15:00.150
towards isolation, towards keeping to ourselves,

00:15:00.150 --> 00:15:03.150
crashes head first into our modern world.

00:15:03.150 --> 00:15:05.150
This remarkable image

00:15:05.150 --> 00:15:07.150
is not a map of the world.

00:15:07.150 --> 00:15:11.150
In fact, it's a map of Facebook friendship links.

00:15:11.150 --> 00:15:13.150
And when you plot those friendship links

00:15:13.150 --> 00:15:15.150
by their latitude and longitude,

00:15:15.150 --> 00:15:18.150
it literally draws a map of the world.

00:15:18.150 --> 00:15:20.150
Our modern world is communicating

00:15:20.150 --> 00:15:22.150
with itself and with each other

00:15:22.150 --> 00:15:24.150
more than it has

00:15:24.150 --> 00:15:26.150
at any time in its past.

00:15:26.150 --> 00:15:29.150
And that communication, that connectivity around the world,

00:15:29.150 --> 00:15:31.150
that globalization

00:15:31.150 --> 00:15:34.150
now raises a burden.

00:15:34.150 --> 00:15:36.150
Because these different languages

00:15:36.150 --> 00:15:38.150
impose a barrier, as we've just seen,

00:15:38.150 --> 00:15:40.150
to the transfer of goods and ideas

00:15:40.150 --> 00:15:42.150
and technologies and wisdom.

00:15:42.150 --> 00:15:45.150
And they impose a barrier to cooperation.

00:15:45.150 --> 00:15:48.150
And nowhere do we see that more clearly

00:15:48.150 --> 00:15:50.150
than in the European Union,

00:15:50.150 --> 00:15:53.150
whose 27 member countries

00:15:53.150 --> 00:15:56.150
speak 23 official languages.

00:15:56.150 --> 00:15:58.150
The European Union

00:15:58.150 --> 00:16:02.150
is now spending over one billion euros annually

00:16:02.150 --> 00:16:05.150
translating among their 23 official languages.

00:16:05.150 --> 00:16:07.150
That's something on the order

00:16:07.150 --> 00:16:09.150
of 1.45 billion U.S. dollars

00:16:09.150 --> 00:16:12.150
on translation costs alone.

00:16:12.150 --> 00:16:14.150
Now think of the absurdity of this situation.

00:16:14.150 --> 00:16:16.150
If 27 individuals

00:16:16.150 --> 00:16:18.150
from those 27 member states

00:16:18.150 --> 00:16:21.150
sat around table, speaking their 23 languages,

00:16:21.150 --> 00:16:23.150
some very simple mathematics will tell you

00:16:23.150 --> 00:16:27.150
that you need an army of 253 translators

00:16:27.150 --> 00:16:31.150
to anticipate all the pairwise possibilities.

00:16:31.150 --> 00:16:34.150
The European Union employs a permanent staff

00:16:34.150 --> 00:16:36.150
of about 2,500 translators.

00:16:36.150 --> 00:16:38.150
And in 2007 alone --

00:16:38.150 --> 00:16:40.150
and I'm sure there are more recent figures --

00:16:40.150 --> 00:16:43.150
something on the order of 1.3 million pages

00:16:43.150 --> 00:16:46.150
were translated into English alone.

00:16:46.150 --> 00:16:49.150
And so if language really is

00:16:49.150 --> 00:16:52.150
the solution to the crisis of visual theft,

00:16:52.150 --> 00:16:54.150
if language really is

00:16:54.150 --> 00:16:56.150
the conduit of our cooperation,

00:16:56.150 --> 00:16:59.150
the technology that our species derived

00:16:59.150 --> 00:17:03.150
to promote the free flow and exchange of ideas,

00:17:03.150 --> 00:17:05.150
in our modern world,

00:17:05.150 --> 00:17:07.150
we confront a question.

00:17:07.150 --> 00:17:09.150
And that question is whether

00:17:09.150 --> 00:17:11.150
in this modern, globalized world

00:17:11.150 --> 00:17:14.150
we can really afford to have all these different languages.

00:17:14.150 --> 00:17:17.150
To put it this way, nature knows no other circumstance

00:17:17.150 --> 00:17:22.150
in which functionally equivalent traits coexist.

00:17:22.150 --> 00:17:25.150
One of them always drives the other extinct.

00:17:25.150 --> 00:17:27.150
And we see this in the inexorable march

00:17:27.150 --> 00:17:29.150
towards standardization.

00:17:29.150 --> 00:17:32.150
There are lots and lots of ways of measuring things --

00:17:32.150 --> 00:17:34.150
weighing them and measuring their length --

00:17:34.150 --> 00:17:36.150
but the metric system is winning.

00:17:36.150 --> 00:17:39.150
There are lots and lots of ways of measuring time,

00:17:39.150 --> 00:17:42.150
but a really bizarre base 60 system

00:17:42.150 --> 00:17:44.150
known as hours and minutes and seconds

00:17:44.150 --> 00:17:47.150
is nearly universal around the world.

00:17:47.150 --> 00:17:49.150
There are many, many ways

00:17:49.150 --> 00:17:51.150
of imprinting CDs or DVDs,

00:17:51.150 --> 00:17:54.150
but those are all being standardized as well.

00:17:54.150 --> 00:17:57.150
And you can probably think of many, many more

00:17:57.150 --> 00:17:59.150
in your own everyday lives.

00:17:59.150 --> 00:18:02.150
And so our modern world now

00:18:02.150 --> 00:18:04.150
is confronting us with a dilemma.

00:18:04.150 --> 00:18:06.150
And it's the dilemma

00:18:06.150 --> 00:18:08.150
that this Chinese man faces,

00:18:08.150 --> 00:18:10.150
who's language is spoken

00:18:10.150 --> 00:18:12.150
by more people in the world

00:18:12.150 --> 00:18:15.150
than any other single language,

00:18:15.150 --> 00:18:19.150
and yet he is sitting at his blackboard,

00:18:19.150 --> 00:18:22.150
converting Chinese phrases

00:18:22.150 --> 00:18:24.150
into English language phrases.

00:18:24.150 --> 00:18:27.150
And what this does is it raises the possibility to us

00:18:27.150 --> 00:18:29.150
that in a world in which we want to promote

00:18:29.150 --> 00:18:31.150
cooperation and exchange,

00:18:31.150 --> 00:18:34.150
and in a world that might be dependent more than ever before

00:18:34.150 --> 00:18:36.150
on cooperation

00:18:36.150 --> 00:18:39.150
to maintain and enhance our levels of prosperity,

00:18:39.150 --> 00:18:41.150
his actions suggest to us

00:18:41.150 --> 00:18:43.150
it might be inevitable

00:18:43.150 --> 00:18:45.150
that we have to confront the idea

00:18:45.150 --> 00:18:48.150
that our destiny is to be one world with one language.

00:18:48.150 --> 00:18:50.150
Thank you.

00:18:50.150 --> 00:18:58.150
(Applause)

00:18:58.150 --> 00:19:00.150
Matt Ridley: Mark, one question.

00:19:00.150 --> 00:19:03.150
Svante found that the FOXP2 gene,

00:19:03.150 --> 00:19:05.150
which seems to be associated with language,

00:19:05.150 --> 00:19:07.150
was also shared in the same form

00:19:07.150 --> 00:19:09.150
in Neanderthals as us.

00:19:09.150 --> 00:19:11.150
Do we have any idea

00:19:11.150 --> 00:19:13.150
how we could have defeated Neanderthals

00:19:13.150 --> 00:19:15.150
if they also had language?

00:19:15.150 --> 00:19:17.150
Mark Pagel: This is a very good question.

00:19:17.150 --> 00:19:20.150
So many of you will be familiar with the idea that there's this gene called FOXP2

00:19:20.150 --> 00:19:23.150
that seems to be implicated in some ways

00:19:23.150 --> 00:19:26.150
in the fine motor control that's associated with language.

00:19:26.150 --> 00:19:28.150
The reason why I don't believe that tells us

00:19:28.150 --> 00:19:30.150
that the Neanderthals had language

00:19:30.150 --> 00:19:33.150
is -- here's a simple analogy:

00:19:33.150 --> 00:19:36.150
Ferraris are cars that have engines.

00:19:36.150 --> 00:19:38.150
My car has an engine,

00:19:38.150 --> 00:19:40.150
but it's not a Ferrari.

00:19:40.150 --> 00:19:42.150
Now the simple answer then

00:19:42.150 --> 00:19:44.150
is that genes alone don't, all by themselves,

00:19:44.150 --> 00:19:46.150
determine the outcome

00:19:46.150 --> 00:19:48.150
of very complicated things like language.

00:19:48.150 --> 00:19:50.150
What we know about this FOXP2 and Neanderthals

00:19:50.150 --> 00:19:54.150
is that they may have had fine motor control of their mouths -- who knows.

00:19:54.150 --> 00:19:56.150
But that doesn't tell us they necessarily had language.

00:19:56.150 --> 00:19:58.150
MR: Thank you very much indeed.

00:19:58.150 --> 00:20:01.150
