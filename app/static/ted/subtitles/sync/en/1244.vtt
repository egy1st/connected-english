WEBVTT

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:14.150
Well we all know the World Wide Web

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:18.150
has absolutely transformed publishing, broadcasting,

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:20.150
commerce and social connectivity,

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:22.150
but where did it all come from?

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:24.150
And I'll quote three people:

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.150
Vannevar Bush, Doug Engelbart and Tim Berners-Lee.

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.150
So let's just run through these guys.

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:31.150
This is Vannevar Bush.

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:34.150
Vannevar Bush was the U.S. government's chief scientific adviser during the war.

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:36.150
And in 1945,

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:39.150
he published an article in a magazine called Atlantic Monthly.

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:42.150
And the article was called "As We May Think."

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:44.150
And what Vannevar Bush was saying

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:47.150
was the way we use information is broken.

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:50.150
We don't work in terms of libraries

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:52.150
and catalog systems and so forth.

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:54.150
The brain works by association.

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:57.150
With one item in its thought, it snaps instantly to the next item.

00:00:57.150 --> 00:00:59.150
And the way information is structured

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:02.150
is totally incapable of keeping up with this process.

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:04.150
And so he suggested a machine,

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:06.150
and he called it the memex.

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.150
And the memex would link information,

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:11.150
one piece of information to a related piece of information and so forth.

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:13.150
Now this was in 1945.

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:15.150
A computer in those days

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:18.150
was something the secret services used to use for code breaking.

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.150
And nobody knew anything about it.

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:22.150
So this was before the computer was invented.

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:24.150
And he proposed this machine called the memex.

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.150
And he had a platform where you linked information to other information,

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.150
and then you could call it up at will.

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:31.150
So spinning forward,

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:33.150
one of the guys who read this article was a guy called Doug Engelbart,

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.150
and he was a U.S. Air Force officer.

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:38.150
And he was reading it in their library in the Far East.

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:40.150
And he was so inspired by this article,

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:42.150
it kind of directed the rest of his life.

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:45.150
And by the mid-60s, he was able to put this into action

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:48.150
when he worked at the Stanford Research Lab in California.

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:51.150
He built a system.

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:54.150
The system was designed to augment human intelligence, it was called.

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:57.150
And in a premonition of today's world

00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:59.150
of cloud computing and softwares of service,

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:01.150
his system was called NLS

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:03.150
for oN-Line System.

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:05.150
And this is Doug Engelbart.

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:08.150
He was giving a presentation at the Fall Joint Computer Conference

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:11.150
in 1968.

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:13.150
What he showed --

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:16.150
he sat on a stage like this, and he demonstrated this system.

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:18.150
He had his head mic like I've got.

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:20.150
And he works this system.

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:22.150
And you can see, he's working between documents

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:24.150
and graphics and so forth.

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:26.150
And he's driving it all

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:28.150
with this platform here,

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:30.150
with a five-finger keyboard

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:32.150
and the world's first computer mouse,

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:34.150
which he specially designed in order to do this system.

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:36.150
So this is where the mouse came from as well.

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:38.150
So this is Doug Engelbart.

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:40.150
The trouble with Doug Engelbart's system

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:43.150
was that the computers in those days cost several million pounds.

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:45.150
So for a personal computer,

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:47.150
a few million pounds was like having a personal jet plane;

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:49.150
it wasn't really very practical.

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:51.150
But spin on to the 80s

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:53.150
when personal computers did arrive,

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:55.150
then there was room for this kind of system on personal computers.

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:57.150
And my company, OWL

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:00.150
built a system called Guide for the Apple Macintosh.

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:04.150
And we delivered the world's first hypertext system.

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:06.150
And this began to get a head of steam.

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:08.150
Apple introduced a thing called HyperCard,

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:10.150
and they made a bit of a fuss about it.

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:13.150
They had a 12-page supplement in the Wall Street Journal the day it launched.

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:15.150
The magazines started to cover it.

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:17.150
Byte magazine and Communications at the ACM

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:19.150
had special issues covering hypertext.

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:21.150
We developed a PC version of this product

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:23.150
as well as the Macintosh version.

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:26.150
And our PC version became quite mature.

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:29.150
These are some examples of this system in action in the late 80s.

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:33.150
You were able to deliver documents, were able to do it over networks.

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:35.150
We developed a system such

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:37.150
that it had a markup language based on html.

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:40.150
We called it hml: hypertext markup language.

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:42.150
And the system was capable of doing

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:46.150
very, very large documentation systems over computer networks.

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:49.150
So I took this system to a trade show in Versailles near Paris

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:52.150
in late November 1990.

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:54.150
And I was approached by a nice young man called Tim Berners-Lee

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:56.150
who said, "Are you Ian Ritchie?" and I said, "Yeah."

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:58.150
And he said, "I need to talk to you."

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:01.150
And he told me about his proposed system called the World Wide Web.

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:04.150
And I thought, well, that's got a pretentious name,

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:07.150
especially since the whole system ran on his computer in his office.

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:10.150
But he was completely convinced that his World Wide Web

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:12.150
would take over the world one day.

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:14.150
And he tried to persuade me to write the browser for it,

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:17.150
because his system didn't have any graphics or fonts or layout or anything;

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:19.150
it was just plain text.

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:22.150
I thought, well, you know, interesting,

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:24.150
but a guy from CERN, he's not going to do this.

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:26.150
So we didn't do it.

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:28.150
In the next couple of years,

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:30.150
the hypertext community didn't recognize him either.

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:33.150
In 1992, his paper was rejected for the Hypertext Conference.

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:36.150
In 1993,

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:38.150
there was a table at the conference in Seattle,

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:40.150
and a guy called Marc Andreessen

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:43.150
was demonstrating his little browser for the World Wide Web.

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:45.150
And I saw it, and I thought, yep, that's it.

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:48.150
And the very next year, in 1994, we had the conference here in Edinburgh,

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:52.150
and I had no opposition in having Tim Berners-Lee as the keynote speaker.

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:54.150
So that puts me in pretty illustrious company.

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:56.150
There was a guy called Dick Rowe

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:58.150
who was at Decca Records and turned down The Beatles.

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:00.150
There was a guy called Gary Kildall

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:02.150
who went flying his plane

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:04.150
when IBM came looking for an operating system

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:06.150
for the IBM PC,

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:08.150
and he wasn't there, so they went back to see Bill Gates.

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:10.150
And the 12 publishers

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:13.150
who turned down J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter, I guess.

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:15.150
On the other hand, there's Marc Andreessen

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:17.150
who wrote the world's first browser for the World Wide Web.

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:19.150
And according to Fortune magazine,

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:21.150
he's worth 700 million dollars.

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:23.150
But is he happy?

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:25.150
(Laughter)

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:32.150
(Applause)
