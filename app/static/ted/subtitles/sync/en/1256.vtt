WEBVTT

00:00:13.118 --> 00:00:16.411
I moved to Boston
10 years ago from Chicago,

00:00:16.435 --> 00:00:19.030
with an interest in cancer
and in chemistry.

00:00:19.523 --> 00:00:22.818
You might know that chemistry
is the science of making molecules

00:00:22.842 --> 00:00:24.158
or, to my taste,

00:00:24.182 --> 00:00:25.813
new drugs for cancer.

00:00:26.329 --> 00:00:29.126
And you might also know that,
for science and medicine,

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:31.558
Boston is a bit of a candy store.

00:00:32.657 --> 00:00:37.280
You can't roll a stop sign in Cambridge
without hitting a graduate student.

00:00:37.304 --> 00:00:39.479
The bar is called the Miracle of Science.

00:00:39.883 --> 00:00:42.745
The billboards say "Lab Space Available."

00:00:43.546 --> 00:00:45.705
And it's fair to say
that in these 10 years,

00:00:45.729 --> 00:00:50.036
we've witnessed absolutely the start
of a scientific revolution --

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:51.539
that of genome medicine.

00:00:51.925 --> 00:00:54.655
We know more about the patients
that enter our clinic now

00:00:54.679 --> 00:00:55.838
than ever before.

00:00:55.862 --> 00:00:58.086
And we're able, finally,
to answer the question

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:00.474
that's been so pressing for so many years:

00:01:00.498 --> 00:01:02.454
Why do I have cancer?

00:01:03.565 --> 00:01:05.686
This information
is also pretty staggering.

00:01:06.105 --> 00:01:09.198
You might know that, so far,
in just the dawn of this revolution,

00:01:09.222 --> 00:01:12.948
we know that there are perhaps
40,000 unique mutations

00:01:12.972 --> 00:01:15.583
affecting more than 10,000 genes,

00:01:15.607 --> 00:01:18.970
and that there are 500 of these genes
that are bona-fide drivers,

00:01:18.994 --> 00:01:20.890
causes of cancer.

00:01:21.984 --> 00:01:23.179
Yet comparatively,

00:01:23.203 --> 00:01:25.965
we have about a dozen
targeted medications.

00:01:26.862 --> 00:01:29.124
And this inadequacy of cancer medicine

00:01:29.148 --> 00:01:33.258
really hit home when my father
was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer.

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:36.761
We didn't fly him to Boston.

00:01:36.785 --> 00:01:38.316
We didn't sequence his genome.

00:01:38.697 --> 00:01:41.839
It's been known for decades
what causes this malignancy.

00:01:43.253 --> 00:01:47.300
It's three proteins: ras, myc, p53.

00:01:47.827 --> 00:01:50.525
This is old information
we've known since about the 80s,

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:52.469
yet there's no medicine I can prescribe

00:01:52.493 --> 00:01:56.056
to a patient with this
or any of the numerous solid tumors

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:57.772
caused by these three ...

00:01:58.731 --> 00:02:01.040
Horsemen of the Apocalypse that is cancer.

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:03.865
There's no ras, no myc, no p53 drug.

00:02:04.246 --> 00:02:06.500
And you might fairly ask: Why is that?

00:02:07.199 --> 00:02:10.032
And the very unsatisfying
yet scientific answer is:

00:02:10.056 --> 00:02:11.214
it's too hard.

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:13.040
That for whatever reason,

00:02:13.064 --> 00:02:16.557
these three proteins have entered
a space, in the language of our field,

00:02:16.581 --> 00:02:18.781
that's called the undruggable genome --

00:02:18.805 --> 00:02:21.095
which is like calling
a computer unsurfable

00:02:21.119 --> 00:02:22.375
or the Moon unwalkable.

00:02:22.399 --> 00:02:24.507
It's a horrible term of trade.

00:02:24.531 --> 00:02:25.689
But what it means

00:02:25.713 --> 00:02:28.935
is that we've failed to identify
a greasy pocket in these proteins,

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:31.229
into which we, like molecular locksmiths,

00:02:31.253 --> 00:02:36.345
can fashion an active, small,
organic molecule or drug substance.

00:02:36.924 --> 00:02:39.357
Now, as I was training
in clinical medicine

00:02:39.381 --> 00:02:42.842
and hematology and oncology
and stem-cell transplantation,

00:02:42.866 --> 00:02:44.739
what we had instead,

00:02:44.763 --> 00:02:48.278
cascading through the regulatory
network at the FDA,

00:02:48.302 --> 00:02:49.735
were these substances:

00:02:49.759 --> 00:02:51.068
arsenic,

00:02:51.092 --> 00:02:52.257
thalidomide,

00:02:52.281 --> 00:02:55.638
and this chemical derivative
of nitrogen mustard gas.

00:02:55.662 --> 00:02:58.271
And this is the 21st century.

00:02:58.295 --> 00:02:59.541
And so, I guess you'd say,

00:02:59.565 --> 00:03:02.702
dissatisfied with the performance
and quality of these medicines,

00:03:02.726 --> 00:03:04.999
I went back to school, in chemistry,

00:03:06.199 --> 00:03:10.858
with the idea that perhaps by learning
the trade of discovery chemistry

00:03:10.882 --> 00:03:13.755
and approaching it in the context
of this brave new world

00:03:13.779 --> 00:03:15.991
of the open source,

00:03:16.015 --> 00:03:17.443
the crowd source,

00:03:17.467 --> 00:03:20.772
the collaborative network
that we have access to within academia,

00:03:20.796 --> 00:03:25.074
that we might more quickly bring
powerful and targeted therapies

00:03:25.098 --> 00:03:26.460
to our patients.

00:03:26.841 --> 00:03:29.941
And so, please consider
this a work in progress,

00:03:29.965 --> 00:03:31.982
but I'd like to tell you today a story

00:03:32.006 --> 00:03:35.207
about a very rare cancer
called midline carcinoma,

00:03:36.009 --> 00:03:40.223
about the undruggable protein target
that causes this cancer,

00:03:40.247 --> 00:03:41.775
called BRD4,

00:03:41.799 --> 00:03:45.644
and about a molecule developed at my lab
at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute,

00:03:45.668 --> 00:03:46.820
called JQ1,

00:03:46.844 --> 00:03:49.066
which we affectionately named for Jun Qi,

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:51.129
the chemist that made this molecule.

00:03:51.859 --> 00:03:54.555
Now, BRD4 is an interesting protein.

00:03:54.579 --> 00:03:58.260
You might ask: with all the things
cancer's trying to do to kill our patient,

00:03:58.284 --> 00:03:59.872
how does it remember it's cancer?

00:03:59.896 --> 00:04:01.327
When it winds up its genome,

00:04:01.351 --> 00:04:03.722
divides into two cells and unwinds again,

00:04:03.746 --> 00:04:05.983
why does it not turn
into an eye, into a liver,

00:04:06.007 --> 00:04:08.388
as it has all the genes
necessary to do this?

00:04:08.412 --> 00:04:09.974
It remembers that it's cancer.

00:04:10.838 --> 00:04:13.926
And the reason is that cancer,
like every cell in the body,

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:15.926
places little molecular bookmarks,

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:17.328
little Post-it notes,

00:04:17.352 --> 00:04:20.335
that remind the cell, "I'm cancer;
I should keep growing."

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:24.963
And those Post-it notes involve this
and other proteins of its class --

00:04:24.987 --> 00:04:26.303
so-called bromodomains.

00:04:26.882 --> 00:04:29.550
So we developed an idea, a rationale,

00:04:29.574 --> 00:04:31.723
that perhaps if we made a molecule

00:04:31.747 --> 00:04:34.040
that prevented
the Post-it note from sticking

00:04:34.064 --> 00:04:35.723
by entering into the little pocket

00:04:35.747 --> 00:04:37.603
at the base of this spinning protein,

00:04:37.627 --> 00:04:39.683
then maybe we could convince cancer cells,

00:04:39.707 --> 00:04:42.508
certainly those addicted
to this BRD4 protein,

00:04:42.532 --> 00:04:43.849
that they're not cancer.

00:04:44.568 --> 00:04:46.791
And so we started to work on this problem.

00:04:46.815 --> 00:04:49.117
We developed libraries of compounds

00:04:49.141 --> 00:04:51.926
and eventually arrived
at this and similar substances

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:53.132
called JQ1.

00:04:53.727 --> 00:04:55.291
Now, not being a drug company,

00:04:55.315 --> 00:04:58.409
we could do certain things,
we had certain flexibilities,

00:04:58.433 --> 00:05:01.267
that I respect that a pharmaceutical
industry doesn't have.

00:05:01.291 --> 00:05:03.541
We just started mailing it to our friends.

00:05:04.033 --> 00:05:05.186
I have a small lab.

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:08.615
We thought we'd just send it to people
and see how the molecule behaves.

00:05:08.639 --> 00:05:10.089
We sent it to Oxford, England,

00:05:10.113 --> 00:05:13.335
where a group of talented
crystallographers provided this picture,

00:05:13.359 --> 00:05:16.456
which helped us understand exactly
how this molecule is so potent

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:17.646
for this protein target.

00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:20.606
It's what we call a perfect fit
of shape complementarity,

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:21.780
or hand in glove.

00:05:22.477 --> 00:05:24.098
Now, this is a very rare cancer,

00:05:24.122 --> 00:05:25.926
this BRD4-addicted cancer.

00:05:26.351 --> 00:05:28.582
And so we worked with samples of material

00:05:28.606 --> 00:05:32.180
that were collected by young pathologists
at Brigham and Women's Hospital.

00:05:32.204 --> 00:05:34.577
And as we treated these cells
with this molecule,

00:05:34.601 --> 00:05:36.640
we observed something really striking.

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:38.156
The cancer cells --

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:40.247
small, round and rapidly dividing,

00:05:40.271 --> 00:05:42.624
grew these arms and extensions.

00:05:42.648 --> 00:05:44.012
They were changing shape.

00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:45.797
In effect,

00:05:45.821 --> 00:05:49.128
the cancer cell
was forgetting it was cancer

00:05:49.152 --> 00:05:50.660
and becoming a normal cell.

00:05:52.226 --> 00:05:53.583
This got us very excited.

00:05:54.991 --> 00:05:57.579
The next step would be to put
this molecule into mice.

00:05:57.603 --> 00:06:00.998
The only problem was there's no
mouse model of this rare cancer.

00:06:01.022 --> 00:06:03.745
And so at the time
we were doing this research,

00:06:03.769 --> 00:06:07.342
I was caring for a 29-year-old
firefighter from Connecticut

00:06:07.366 --> 00:06:09.248
who was very much at the end of life

00:06:09.272 --> 00:06:11.128
with this incurable cancer.

00:06:11.771 --> 00:06:15.221
This BRD4-addicted cancer
was growing throughout his left lung.

00:06:15.245 --> 00:06:18.410
And he had a chest tube in
that was draining little bits of debris.

00:06:18.434 --> 00:06:21.395
And every nursing shift,
we would throw this material out.

00:06:21.419 --> 00:06:23.186
And so we approached this patient

00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:25.222
and asked if he would collaborate with us.

00:06:25.865 --> 00:06:29.564
Could we take this precious
and rare cancerous material

00:06:29.588 --> 00:06:31.187
from this chest tube

00:06:31.211 --> 00:06:33.430
and drive it across town
and put it into mice

00:06:33.454 --> 00:06:37.095
and try to do a clinical trial
at a stage that with a prototype drug,

00:06:37.119 --> 00:06:39.143
well, that would be, of course, impossible

00:06:39.167 --> 00:06:41.000
and, rightly, illegal to do in humans.

00:06:41.024 --> 00:06:42.277
And he obliged us.

00:06:43.156 --> 00:06:45.348
At the Lurie Family Center
for Animal Imaging,

00:06:45.372 --> 00:06:48.987
our colleague, Andrew Kung,
grew this cancer successfully in mice

00:06:49.011 --> 00:06:50.701
without ever touching plastic.

00:06:50.725 --> 00:06:54.141
And you can see this PET scan
of a mouse -- what we call a pet PET.

00:06:54.165 --> 00:06:55.721
The cancer is growing

00:06:55.745 --> 00:06:58.650
as this red, huge mass
in the hind limb of this animal.

00:06:59.071 --> 00:07:01.294
And as we treat it with our compound,

00:07:01.318 --> 00:07:02.926
this addiction to sugar,

00:07:02.950 --> 00:07:04.541
this rapid growth, faded.

00:07:04.565 --> 00:07:06.608
And on the animal on the right,

00:07:06.632 --> 00:07:08.643
you see that the cancer was responding.

00:07:09.719 --> 00:07:11.926
We've completed, now, clinical trials

00:07:11.950 --> 00:07:13.926
in four mouse models of this disease.

00:07:13.950 --> 00:07:15.799
And every time, we see the same thing.

00:07:15.823 --> 00:07:18.528
The mice with this cancer
that get the drug live,

00:07:18.552 --> 00:07:20.848
and the ones that don't rapidly perish.

00:07:22.950 --> 00:07:24.379
So we started to wonder,

00:07:24.403 --> 00:07:26.507
what would a drug company
do at this point?

00:07:26.531 --> 00:07:28.580
Well, they probably
would keep this a secret

00:07:28.604 --> 00:07:30.489
until they turn the prototype drug

00:07:30.513 --> 00:07:32.657
into an active pharmaceutical substance.

00:07:33.213 --> 00:07:34.654
So we did just the opposite.

00:07:35.034 --> 00:07:37.869
We published a paper
that described this finding

00:07:37.893 --> 00:07:39.869
at the earliest prototype stage.

00:07:40.663 --> 00:07:43.571
We gave the world the chemical
identity of this molecule,

00:07:43.595 --> 00:07:45.492
typically a secret in our discipline.

00:07:45.516 --> 00:07:47.492
We told people exactly how to make it.

00:07:48.189 --> 00:07:49.857
We gave them our email address,

00:07:49.881 --> 00:07:51.532
suggesting that if they write us,

00:07:51.556 --> 00:07:53.158
we'll send them a free molecule.

00:07:53.182 --> 00:07:54.270
(Laughter)

00:07:54.294 --> 00:07:57.191
We basically tried to create
the most competitive environment

00:07:57.215 --> 00:07:58.375
for our lab as possible.

00:07:58.399 --> 00:08:00.341
And this was, unfortunately, successful.

00:08:00.365 --> 00:08:01.389
(Laughter)

00:08:01.413 --> 00:08:03.418
Because now, we've shared this molecule,

00:08:03.442 --> 00:08:05.845
just since December of last year,

00:08:05.869 --> 00:08:08.124
with 40 laboratories in the United States

00:08:08.148 --> 00:08:09.926
and 30 more in Europe --

00:08:09.950 --> 00:08:11.799
many of them pharmaceutical companies,

00:08:11.823 --> 00:08:13.418
seeking now to enter this space,

00:08:13.442 --> 00:08:16.491
to target this rare cancer
that, thankfully right now,

00:08:17.346 --> 00:08:19.959
is quite desirable
to study in that industry.

00:08:22.212 --> 00:08:25.281
But the science that's coming back
from all of these laboratories

00:08:25.305 --> 00:08:27.139
about the use of this molecule

00:08:27.163 --> 00:08:30.336
has provided us insights
we might not have had on our own.

00:08:30.360 --> 00:08:32.337
Leukemia cells treated with this compound

00:08:32.361 --> 00:08:34.777
turn into normal white blood cells.

00:08:35.426 --> 00:08:37.207
Mice with multiple myeloma,

00:08:37.231 --> 00:08:40.266
an incurable malignancy
of the bone marrow,

00:08:40.290 --> 00:08:42.267
respond dramatically

00:08:42.291 --> 00:08:44.006
to the treatment with this drug.

00:08:44.466 --> 00:08:46.442
You might know that fat has memory.

00:08:47.514 --> 00:08:49.490
I'll nicely demonstrate that for you.

00:08:49.514 --> 00:08:50.545
(Laughter)

00:08:50.569 --> 00:08:52.121
In fact, this molecule

00:08:52.145 --> 00:08:55.545
prevents this adipocyte,
this fat stem cell,

00:08:55.569 --> 00:08:58.438
from remembering how to make fat,

00:08:58.462 --> 00:09:00.830
such that mice on a high-fat diet,

00:09:00.854 --> 00:09:02.968
like the folks
in my hometown of Chicago --

00:09:02.992 --> 00:09:04.000
(Laughter)

00:09:04.024 --> 00:09:06.032
fail to develop fatty liver,

00:09:06.056 --> 00:09:07.879
which is a major medical problem.

00:09:09.070 --> 00:09:10.642
What this research taught us --

00:09:10.666 --> 00:09:12.926
not just my lab, but our institute,

00:09:12.950 --> 00:09:15.022
and Harvard Medical School
more generally --

00:09:15.046 --> 00:09:17.307
is that we have unique
resources in academia

00:09:17.331 --> 00:09:18.665
for drug discovery;

00:09:18.689 --> 00:09:21.872
that our center, which has tested
perhaps more cancer molecules

00:09:21.896 --> 00:09:23.053
in a scientific way

00:09:23.077 --> 00:09:24.228
than any other,

00:09:24.252 --> 00:09:25.727
never made one of its own.

00:09:26.695 --> 00:09:28.862
For all the reasons you see listed here,

00:09:28.886 --> 00:09:31.625
we think there's a great
opportunity for academic centers

00:09:31.649 --> 00:09:35.473
to participate in this earliest,
conceptually tricky

00:09:35.497 --> 00:09:37.427
and creative discipline

00:09:37.451 --> 00:09:39.233
of prototype drug discovery.

00:09:42.022 --> 00:09:43.172
So what next?

00:09:43.499 --> 00:09:45.879
We have this molecule,
but it's not a pill yet.

00:09:45.903 --> 00:09:48.497
It's not orally bioavailable.

00:09:48.521 --> 00:09:51.716
We need to fix it so we can
deliver it to our patients.

00:09:51.740 --> 00:09:53.324
And everyone in the lab,

00:09:53.348 --> 00:09:56.149
especially following the interaction
with these patients,

00:09:56.173 --> 00:09:58.498
feels quite compelled
to deliver a drug substance

00:09:58.522 --> 00:09:59.720
based on this molecule.

00:09:59.744 --> 00:10:01.155
It's here where I'd say

00:10:01.179 --> 00:10:03.394
that we could use your help
and your insights,

00:10:03.418 --> 00:10:05.280
your collaborative participation.

00:10:05.631 --> 00:10:09.312
Unlike a drug company,
we don't have a pipeline

00:10:09.336 --> 00:10:11.343
that we can deposit these molecules into.

00:10:11.367 --> 00:10:13.764
We don't have a team
of salespeople and marketeers

00:10:13.788 --> 00:10:16.499
to tell us how to position
this drug against the other.

00:10:16.523 --> 00:10:19.191
What we do have is the flexibility
of an academic center

00:10:19.215 --> 00:10:21.567
to work with competent, motivated,

00:10:21.591 --> 00:10:24.496
enthusiastic, hopefully well-funded people

00:10:24.520 --> 00:10:26.813
to carry these molecules
forward into the clinic

00:10:26.837 --> 00:10:30.535
while preserving our ability
to share the prototype drug worldwide.

00:10:31.624 --> 00:10:34.265
This molecule will soon leave our benches

00:10:34.289 --> 00:10:37.339
and go into a small start-up company
called Tensha Therapeutics.

00:10:37.363 --> 00:10:40.299
And, really, this is the fourth
of these molecules

00:10:40.323 --> 00:10:42.570
to kind of "graduate"
from our little pipeline

00:10:42.594 --> 00:10:44.048
of drug discovery,

00:10:44.072 --> 00:10:48.428
two of which -- a topical drug
for lymphoma of the skin

00:10:49.347 --> 00:10:52.458
and an oral substance for the treatment
of multiple myeloma --

00:10:52.482 --> 00:10:55.720
will actually come to the bedside
for the first clinical trial

00:10:55.744 --> 00:10:59.267
in July of this year -- for us,
a major and exciting milestone.

00:11:00.799 --> 00:11:02.822
I want to leave you with just two ideas.

00:11:02.846 --> 00:11:07.180
The first is: if anything is unique
about this research,

00:11:07.204 --> 00:11:09.561
it's less the science than the strategy.

00:11:09.585 --> 00:11:12.007
This, for us, was a social experiment --

00:11:12.031 --> 00:11:17.296
an experiment in "What would happen
if we were as open and honest

00:11:17.320 --> 00:11:19.836
at the earliest phase
of discovery chemistry research

00:11:19.860 --> 00:11:21.307
as we could be?"

00:11:21.331 --> 00:11:23.672
This string of letters and numbers

00:11:23.696 --> 00:11:25.711
and symbols and parentheses

00:11:25.735 --> 00:11:27.354
that can be texted, I suppose,

00:11:27.378 --> 00:11:28.805
or Twittered worldwide,

00:11:30.098 --> 00:11:32.600
is the chemical identity
of our pro compound.

00:11:32.624 --> 00:11:36.706
It's the information that we most need
from pharmaceutical companies,

00:11:36.730 --> 00:11:41.444
the information on how these early
prototype drugs might work.

00:11:41.838 --> 00:11:43.962
Yet this information is largely a secret.

00:11:44.632 --> 00:11:47.511
And so we seek, really, to download

00:11:47.535 --> 00:11:50.654
from the amazing successes
of the computer-science industry,

00:11:50.678 --> 00:11:55.057
two principles -- that of open source
and that of crowdsourcing --

00:11:55.081 --> 00:12:01.075
to quickly, responsibly accelerate
the delivery of targeted therapeutics

00:12:01.099 --> 00:12:02.606
to patients with cancer.

00:12:03.267 --> 00:12:06.386
Now, the business model
involves all of you.

00:12:06.410 --> 00:12:08.386
This research is funded by the public.

00:12:08.735 --> 00:12:10.113
It's funded by foundations.

00:12:10.137 --> 00:12:11.867
And one thing I've learned in Boston

00:12:11.891 --> 00:12:14.965
is that you people will do anything
for cancer, and I love that.

00:12:14.989 --> 00:12:17.886
You bike across the state,
you walk up and down the river.

00:12:17.910 --> 00:12:19.450
(Laughter)

00:12:20.040 --> 00:12:22.366
I've never seen, really, anywhere,

00:12:22.390 --> 00:12:25.633
this unique support for cancer research.

00:12:25.657 --> 00:12:27.414
And so I want to thank you

00:12:27.438 --> 00:12:30.735
for your participation, your collaboration

00:12:30.759 --> 00:12:31.920
and most of all,

00:12:31.944 --> 00:12:33.878
for your confidence in our ideas.

00:12:33.902 --> 00:12:39.403
(Applause)
