00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.150
So magic is a very introverted field.

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:19.150
While scientists regularly publish their latest research,

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:23.150
we magicians do not like to share our methods and secrets.

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:25.150
That's true even amongst peers.

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:28.150
But if you look at creative practice as a form of research,

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:32.150
or art as a form of R&amp;D for humanity,

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:34.150
then how could a cyber illusionist like myself

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:36.150
share his research?

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:40.150
Now my own speciality is combining digital technology and magic.

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:42.150
And about three years ago,

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:44.150
I started an exercise

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:46.150
in openness and inclusiveness

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:50.150
by reaching out into the open-source software community

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:53.150
to create new digital tools for magic --

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:56.150
tools that could eventually be shared with other artists

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:59.150
to start them off further on in the process

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:03.150
and to get them to the poetry faster.

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:06.150
Today, I'd like to show you something which came out of these collaborations.

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.150
It's an augmented reality

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:10.150
projection tracking and mapping system,

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:13.150
or a digital storytelling tool.

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:16.150
Could we bring down the lights please? Thank you.

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:21.150
So let's give this a try.

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.150
And I'm going to use it

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:29.150
to give you my take

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:32.150
on the stuff of life.

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:36.150
(Applause)

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:45.150
(Music)

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:48.150
Terribly sorry. I forgot the floor.

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:55.150
Wake up.

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:58.150
Hey.

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:03.150
Come on.

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:19.150
(Music)

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:23.150
Please.

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:39.150
(Music)

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:41.150
Come on.

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:43.150
Ah, sorry about that.

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:45.150
Forgot this.

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:56.150
(Music)

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:58.150
Give it another try.

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:06.150
Okay.

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:08.150
He figured out the system.

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:15.150
(Music)

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:18.150
(Laughter)

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:20.150
(Applause)

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:29.150
(Music)

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:31.150
Uh oh.

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:41.150
(Music)

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:44.150
All right. Let's try this.

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:47.150
Come on.

00:03:49.150 --> 00:04:09.150
(Music)

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:12.150
(Laughter)

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:37.150
(Music)

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:39.150
Hey.

00:04:39.150 --> 00:05:13.150
(Music)

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:15.150
You heard her, go ahead.

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:18.150
(Laughter)

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:21.150
(Applause)

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:23.150
Bye-bye.

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:35.150
(Applause)
