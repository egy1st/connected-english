00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:14.150
Hi. Today, I'm going to take you through glimpses

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:16.150
of about eight of my projects,

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:19.150
done in collaboration with Danish artist Soren Pors.

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:21.150
We call ourselves Pors and Rao,

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.150
and we live and work in India.

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:26.150
I'd like to begin with my very first object,

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:28.150
which I call "The Uncle Phone."

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:31.150
And it was inspired by my uncle's peculiar habit

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:33.150
of constantly asking me to do things for him,

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:35.150
almost like I were an extension of his body --

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:37.150
to turn on the lights or to bring him a glass of water,

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:39.150
a pack of cigarettes.

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:41.150
And as I grew up, it became worse and worse,

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:43.150
And I started to think of it as a form of control.

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:45.150
But of course, I could never say anything,

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:47.150
because the uncle is a respected figure

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:49.150
in the Indian family.

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:52.150
And the situation that irked me and mystified me the most

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:54.150
was his use of a landline telephone.

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:57.150
He would hold on to the receiver and expect me to dial a number for him.

00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:00.150
And so as a response and as a gift to my uncle,

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:02.150
I made him "The Uncle Phone."

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:05.150
It's so long that it requires two people to use it.

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:09.150
It's exactly the way my uncle uses a phone that's designed for one person.

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.150
But the problem is that, when I left home and went to college,

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.150
I started missing his commands.

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:16.150
And so I made him a golden typewriter

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:18.150
through which he could dispense his commands

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:21.150
to nephews and nieces around the world as an email.

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:24.150
So what he had to do was take a piece of paper, roll it into the carriage,

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.150
type his email or command and pull the paper out.

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:30.150
This device would automatically send the intended person

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.150
the letter as an email.

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:35.150
So here you can see, we embedded a lot of electronics

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:37.150
that understands all of the mechanical actions

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:39.150
and converts it to digital.

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:42.150
So my uncle is only dealing with a mechanical interface.

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:45.150
And of course, the object had to be very grand and have a sense of ritualism,

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:47.150
the way my uncle likes it.

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:50.150
The next work is a sound-sensitive installation

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:53.150
that we affectionately call "The Pygmies."

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:55.150
And we wanted to work with a notion of being

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:59.150
surrounded by a tribe of very shy, sensitive and sweet creatures.

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:02.150
So how it works is we have these panels, which we have on the wall,

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:05.150
and behind them, we have these little creatures which hide.

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:08.150
And as soon as it's silent, they sort of creep out.

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:10.150
And if it's even more silent, they stretch their necks out.

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:13.150
And at the slightest sound, they hide back again.

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:16.150
So we had these panels on three walls of a room.

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:19.150
And we had over 500 of these little pygmies hiding behind them.

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:21.150
So this is how it works.

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:23.150
This is a video prototype.

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:26.150
So when it's quiet, it's sort of coming out from behind the panels.

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:28.150
And they hear like humans do, or real creatures do.

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:31.150
So they get immune to sounds that scare them after awhile.

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:34.150
And they don't react to background sounds.

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:37.150
You'll hear a train in moment that they don't react to.

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:39.150
(Noise)

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:42.150
But they react to foreground sounds. You'll hear that in a second.

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:45.150
(Whistling)

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:49.150
So we worked very hard

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:52.150
to make them as lifelike as possible.

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:55.150
So each pygmy has its own behavior, psyche,

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:58.150
mood swings, personalities and so on.

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:00.150
So this is a very early prototype.

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:02.150
Of course, it got much better after that.

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:04.150
And we made them react to people,

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:08.150
but we found that people were being quite playful and childlike with them.

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:11.150
This is a video installation called "The Missing Person."

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:13.150
And we were quite intrigued

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:15.150
with playing with the notion of invisibility.

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:18.150
How would it be possible to experience a sense of invisibility?

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:20.150
So we worked with a company

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:22.150
that specializes in camera surveillance,

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:25.150
and we asked them to develop a piece of software with us,

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:27.150
using a camera

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:29.150
that could look at people in the room, track them

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:32.150
and replace one person with the background, rendering them invisible.

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:35.150
So I'm just going to show you a very early prototype.

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:37.150
On the right side you can see my colleague Soren,

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:39.150
who's actually in the space.

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:41.150
And on the left side, you'll see the processed video

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:44.150
where the camera has made him invisible.

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:47.150
Soren enters the room. Pop! He goes invisible.

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:50.150
And you can see that the camera is tracking him and erasing.

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:52.150
It's a very early video,

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:54.150
so we haven't yet dealt with the overlap and all of that,

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:57.150
but that got refined pretty soon, later.

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:00.150
So how we used it was in a room where we had a camera looking into the space,

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:03.150
and we had one monitor, one on each wall.

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:05.150
And as people walked into the room,

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:08.150
they would see themselves in the monitor, except with one difference:

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:10.150
one person was constantly invisible

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:12.150
wherever they moved in the room.

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:14.150
So this is a work called "The Sun Shadow."

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:17.150
And it was almost like a sheet of paper,

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:19.150
like a cutout of a childlike drawing

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:21.150
of an oil spill or a sun.

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:24.150
And from the front, this object appeared to be very strong and robust,

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:27.150
and from the side, it almost seemed very weak.

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:30.150
So people would walking into the room and they'd almost ignore it,

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:32.150
thinking it was some crap laying around.

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:34.150
But as soon as they passed by,

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:36.150
it would start to climb up the wall in jerky fashion.

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:39.150
And it would get exhausted, and it would collapse every time.

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:41.150
(Laughter)

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:43.150
So this work

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:45.150
is a caricature of an upside-down man.

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:47.150
His head is so heavy, full of heavy thoughts,

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:49.150
that it's sort of fallen into his hat,

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:51.150
and his body's grown out of him almost like a plant.

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:53.150
Well what he does is he moves around

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:55.150
in a very drunken fashion on his head

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:58.150
in a very unpredictable and extremely slow movement.

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:01.150
And it's kind of constrained by that circle.

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:04.150
Because if that circle weren't there, and the floor was very even,

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:06.150
it would start to wander about in the space.

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:08.150
And there's no wires.

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:10.150
So I'll just show you an instance --

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:12.150
so when people enter the room, it activates this object.

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:14.150
And it very slowly, over a few minutes,

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:16.150
sort of painfully goes up,

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:18.150
and then it gains momentum

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:20.150
and it looks like it's almost about to fall.

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:22.150
And this is an important moment,

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:24.150
because we wanted to instill in the viewer

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:26.150
an instinct to almost go and help, or save the subject.

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:28.150
But it doesn't really need it,

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:31.150
because it, again, sort of manages to pull itself up.

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:34.150
So this work was a real technical challenge for us,

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:37.150
and we worked very hard, like most of our works, over years

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:40.150
to get the mechanics right and the equilibrium and the dynamics.

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:42.150
And it was very important for us

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:45.150
to establish the exact moment that it would fall,

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:48.150
because if we made it in a way that it would topple over,

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:50.150
then it would damage itself,

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:53.150
and if it didn't fall enough, it wouldn't instill that fatalism,

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:55.150
or that sense of wanting to go and help it.

00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:57.150
So I'm going to show you a very quick video

00:05:57.150 --> 00:05:59.150
where we are doing a test scenario -- it's much faster.

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:01.150
That's my colleague. He's let it go.

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:03.150
Now he's getting nervous, so he's going to go catch it.

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:05.150
But he doesn't need to,

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:07.150
because it manages to lift itself up on its own.

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:10.150
So this is a work that we were very intrigued with,

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:12.150
working with the aesthetic of fur

00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:15.150
embedded with thousands of tiny different sizes

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:18.150
of fiber optics, which twinkle like the night sky.

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:20.150
And it's at the scale of the night sky.

00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:22.150
So we wrapped this around a blob-like form,

00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:24.150
which is in the shape of a teddy bear,

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:26.150
which was hanging from the ceiling.

00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:28.150
And the idea was to sort of contrast

00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:31.150
something very cold and distant and abstract like the universe

00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:33.150
into the familiar form of a teddy bear,

00:06:33.150 --> 00:06:35.150
which is very comforting and intimate.

00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:37.150
And the idea was that at some point

00:06:37.150 --> 00:06:39.150
you would stop looking at the form of a teddy bear

00:06:39.150 --> 00:06:42.150
and you would almost perceive it to be a hole in the space,

00:06:42.150 --> 00:06:45.150
and as if you were looking out into the twinkling night sky.

00:06:46.150 --> 00:06:48.150
So this is the last work, and a work in progress,

00:06:48.150 --> 00:06:50.150
and it's called "Space Filler."

00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:52.150
Well imagine a small cube that's about this big

00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:54.150
standing in front of you in the middle of the room,

00:06:54.150 --> 00:06:57.150
and as you approached it, it tried to intimidate you

00:06:57.150 --> 00:06:59.150
by growing into a cube

00:06:59.150 --> 00:07:02.150
that's twice its height and [eight] times its volume.

00:07:02.150 --> 00:07:05.150
And so this object is constantly expanding and contracting

00:07:05.150 --> 00:07:07.150
to create a dynamic with people moving around it --

00:07:07.150 --> 00:07:09.150
almost like it were trying

00:07:09.150 --> 00:07:11.150
to conceal a secret within its seams or something.

00:07:11.150 --> 00:07:14.150
So we work with a lot of technology,

00:07:14.150 --> 00:07:16.150
but we don't really love technology,

00:07:16.150 --> 00:07:19.150
because it gives us a lot of pain in our work over years and years.

00:07:19.150 --> 00:07:21.150
But we use it because we're interested

00:07:21.150 --> 00:07:23.150
in the way that it can help us

00:07:23.150 --> 00:07:26.150
to express the emotions and behavioral patterns

00:07:26.150 --> 00:07:28.150
in these creatures that we create.

00:07:28.150 --> 00:07:30.150
And once a creature pops into our minds,

00:07:30.150 --> 00:07:32.150
it's almost like the process of creation

00:07:32.150 --> 00:07:35.150
is to discover the way this creature really wants to exist

00:07:35.150 --> 00:07:37.150
and what form it wants to take and what way it wants to move.

00:07:37.150 --> 00:07:39.150
Thank you.

00:07:39.150 --> 00:07:41.150
(Applause)
