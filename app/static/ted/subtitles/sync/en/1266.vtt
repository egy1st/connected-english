00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:17.150
I'd like to start with a short story.

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:19.150
It's about a little boy

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:24.150
whose father was a history buff

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.150
and who used to take him by the hand

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:30.150
to visit the ruins of an ancient metropolis

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:33.150
on the outskirts of their camp.

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:36.150
They would always stop by to visit

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:39.150
these huge winged bulls that used to guard

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:41.150
the gates of that ancient metropolis,

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:43.150
and the boy used to be scared

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:45.150
of these winged bulls,

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:47.150
but at the same time they excited him.

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:49.150
And the dad used to use those bulls

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:51.150
to tell the boy stories about

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:55.150
that civilization and their work.

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:58.150
Let's fast-forward to the

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:01.150
San Francisco Bay Area many decades later,

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:04.150
where I started a technology company

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:07.150
that brought the world its first

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:09.150
3D laser scanning system.

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.150
Let me show you how it works.

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:13.150
Female Voice: Long range laser scanning

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:16.150
by sending out a pulse that's a laser beam of light.

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:18.150
The system measures the beam's time of flight,

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.150
recording the time it takes for the light

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:23.150
to hit a surface and make its return.

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:25.150
With two mirrors, the scanner calculates

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:28.150
the beam's horizontal and vertical angles,

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:31.150
giving accurate x, y, and z coordinates.

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:33.150
The point is then recorded

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:38.150
into a 3D visualization program.

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:41.150
All of this happens in seconds.

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:45.150
Ben Kacyra: You can see here,

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:48.150
these systems are extremely fast.

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:51.150
They collect millions of points at a time

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:53.150
with very high accuracy

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:55.150
and very high resolution.

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:58.150
A surveyor with traditional survey tools

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:00.150
would be hard-pressed to produce

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:03.150
maybe 500 points in a whole day.

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:06.150
These babies would be producing

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:09.150
something like ten thousand points a second.

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:11.150
So, as you can imagine,

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:14.150
this was a paradigm shift

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:16.150
in the survey and construction

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:19.150
as well as in reality capture industry.

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:26.150
Approximately ten years ago,

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:29.150
my wife and I started a foundation to do good,

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:31.150
and right about that time,

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:34.150
the magnificent Bamiyan Buddhas,

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:37.150
hundred and eighty foot tall in Afghanistan,

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:40.150
were blown up by the Taliban.

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:42.150
They were gone in an instant.

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:44.150
And unfortunately, there was

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:46.150
no detailed documentation of these Buddhas.

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:48.150
This clearly devastated me,

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:50.150
and I couldn't help but wonder about

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:53.150
the fate of my old friends, the winged bulls,

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:56.150
and the fate of the many, many

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:59.150
heritage sites all over the world.

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:01.150
Both my wife and I

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:03.150
were so touched by this

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:05.150
that we decided to

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:08.150
expand the mission of our foundation

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:12.150
to include digital heritage preservation

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:14.150
of world sites.

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:17.150
We called the project CyArk,

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:19.150
which stands for Cyber Archive.

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:21.150
To date, with the help of

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:24.150
a global network of partners,

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:26.150
we've completed close to fifty projects.

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:28.150
Let me show you some of them:

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:30.150
Chichen Itza,

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:32.150
Rapa Nui --

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:34.150
and what you're seeing here

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:36.150
are the cloud of points --

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:38.150
Babylon,

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:40.150
Rosslyn Chapel,

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:42.150
Pompeii,

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:44.150
and our latest project, Mt. Rushmore,

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:46.150
which happened to be one of

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:48.150
our most challenging projects.

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:50.150
As you see here, we had to develop

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:53.150
a special rig to bring the scanner

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:56.150
up close and personal.

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:59.150
The results of our work in the field

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:01.150
are used to produce

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:03.150
media and deliverables to be used

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:06.150
by conservators and researchers.

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:10.150
We also produce media for

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:13.150
dissemination to the public --

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:16.150
free through the CyArk website.

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:19.150
These would be used for education,

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:21.150
cultural tourism, etc.

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:23.150
What you're looking at in here

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:26.150
is a 3D viewer that we developed

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:28.150
that would allow the display

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:30.150
and manipulation of [the] cloud of points

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:33.150
in real time, cutting sections through them

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:35.150
and extracting dimensions.

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:37.150
This happens to be the cloud of points

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:38.150
for Tikal.

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:40.150
In here you see a traditional 2D

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:42.150
architectural engineering drawing

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:45.150
that's used for preservation, and of course

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:48.150
we tell the stories through fly-throughs.

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:50.150
And here, this is a fly-through

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:52.150
the cloud of points of Tikal,

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:55.150
and here you see it rendered

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:57.150
and photo-textured with the photography

00:04:57.150 --> 00:05:00.150
that we take of the site.

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:02.150
And so this is not a video.

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:04.150
This is actual 3D points with

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:07.150
two to three millimeter accuracy.

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:10.150
And of course the data can be used

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:13.150
to develop 3D models that are

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:16.150
very accurate and very detailed.

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:18.150
And here you're looking at a model

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:20.150
that's extracted from the cloud of points

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:22.150
for Stirling Castle.

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:25.150
It's used for studies, for visualization,

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:28.150
as well as for education.

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:30.150
And finally, we produce mobile apps

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:33.150
that include narrated virtual tools.

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:37.150
The more I got involved

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:39.150
in the heritage field,

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:42.150
the more it became clear to me

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:45.150
that we are losing the sites

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:48.150
and the stories faster than we can

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:51.150
physically preserve them.

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:53.150
Of course, earthquakes

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:55.150
and all the natural phenomena --

00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:57.150
floods, tornadoes, etc. --

00:05:57.150 --> 00:06:00.150
take their toll.

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:03.150
However, what occurred to me was

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:05.150
human-caused destruction, which was

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:07.150
not only causing a significant portion

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:10.150
of the destruction, but actually

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:13.150
it was accelerating.

00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:15.150
This includes arson,

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:17.150
urban sprawl,

00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:20.150
acid rain, not to mention

00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:22.150
terrorism and wars.

00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:25.150
It was getting more and more apparent

00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:27.150
that we're fighting a losing battle.

00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:29.150
We're losing our sites

00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:31.150
and the stories,

00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:33.150
and basically we're losing

00:06:33.150 --> 00:06:35.150
a piece -- and a significant piece --

00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:38.150
of our collective memory.

00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:40.150
Imagine us as a human race

00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:44.150
not knowing where we came from.

00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:47.150
Luckily, in the last two or three decades,

00:06:47.150 --> 00:06:50.150
digital technologies have been developing

00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:52.150
that have helped us to develop tools

00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:54.150
that we've brought to bear

00:06:54.150 --> 00:06:56.150
in the digital preservation,

00:06:56.150 --> 00:06:58.150
in our digital preservation war.

00:06:58.150 --> 00:07:00.150
This includes, for example,

00:07:00.150 --> 00:07:04.150
the 3D laser scanning systems,

00:07:04.150 --> 00:07:07.150
ever more powerful personal computers,

00:07:07.150 --> 00:07:09.150
3D graphics,

00:07:09.150 --> 00:07:12.150
high-definition digital photography,

00:07:12.150 --> 00:07:15.150
not to mention the Internet.

00:07:15.150 --> 00:07:17.150
Because of this accelerated

00:07:17.150 --> 00:07:19.150
pace of destruction,

00:07:19.150 --> 00:07:21.150
it became clear to us that we needed

00:07:21.150 --> 00:07:24.150
to challenge ourselves and our partners

00:07:24.150 --> 00:07:26.150
to accelerate our work.

00:07:26.150 --> 00:07:28.150
And we created a project

00:07:28.150 --> 00:07:31.150
we call the CyArk 500 Challenge --

00:07:31.150 --> 00:07:34.150
and that is to digitally preserve

00:07:34.150 --> 00:07:37.150
500 World Heritage Sites

00:07:37.150 --> 00:07:39.150
in five years.

00:07:39.150 --> 00:07:41.150
We do have the technology

00:07:41.150 --> 00:07:43.150
that's scaleable,

00:07:43.150 --> 00:07:47.150
and our network of global partners

00:07:47.150 --> 00:07:50.150
has been expanding and can be expanded

00:07:50.150 --> 00:07:52.150
at a rapid rate,

00:07:52.150 --> 00:07:54.150
so we're comfortable

00:07:54.150 --> 00:07:57.150
that this task can be accomplished.

00:07:57.150 --> 00:08:00.150
However, to me, the 500 is

00:08:00.150 --> 00:08:04.150
really just the first 500.

00:08:04.150 --> 00:08:08.150
In order to sustain our work into the future,

00:08:08.150 --> 00:08:11.150
we use technology centers

00:08:11.150 --> 00:08:14.150
where we partner with

00:08:14.150 --> 00:08:16.150
local universities and colleges

00:08:16.150 --> 00:08:19.150
to take the technology to them,

00:08:19.150 --> 00:08:22.150
whereby they then can help us

00:08:22.150 --> 00:08:25.150
with digital preservation of their heritage sites,

00:08:25.150 --> 00:08:28.150
and at the same time, it gives them

00:08:28.150 --> 00:08:32.150
the technology to benefit from in the future.

00:08:32.150 --> 00:08:36.150
Let me close with another short story.

00:08:36.150 --> 00:08:38.150
Two years ago, we were approached

00:08:38.150 --> 00:08:41.150
by a partner of ours to digitally preserve

00:08:41.150 --> 00:08:43.150
an important heritage site,

00:08:43.150 --> 00:08:46.150
a UNESCO heritage site in Uganda,

00:08:46.150 --> 00:08:49.150
the Royal Kasubi Tombs.

00:08:49.150 --> 00:08:52.150
The work was done successfully in the field,

00:08:52.150 --> 00:08:54.150
and the data was archived

00:08:54.150 --> 00:08:56.150
and publicly disseminated

00:08:56.150 --> 00:08:59.150
through the CyArk website.

00:08:59.150 --> 00:09:01.150
Last March,

00:09:01.150 --> 00:09:04.150
we received very sad news.

00:09:04.150 --> 00:09:07.150
The Royal Tombs had been destroyed

00:09:07.150 --> 00:09:10.150
by suspected arson.

00:09:10.150 --> 00:09:13.150
A few days later, we received a call:

00:09:13.150 --> 00:09:16.150
"Is the data available

00:09:16.150 --> 00:09:20.150
and can it be used for reconstruction?"

00:09:20.150 --> 00:09:23.150
Our answer, of course, was yes.

00:09:25.150 --> 00:09:28.150
Let me leave you with a final thought.

00:09:28.150 --> 00:09:31.150
Our heritage is much more than

00:09:31.150 --> 00:09:33.150
our collective memory --

00:09:33.150 --> 00:09:35.150
it's our collective treasure.

00:09:35.150 --> 00:09:38.150
We owe it to our children,

00:09:38.150 --> 00:09:40.150
our grandchildren and the generations

00:09:40.150 --> 00:09:43.150
we will never meet

00:09:43.150 --> 00:09:45.150
to keep it safe

00:09:45.150 --> 00:09:47.150
and to pass it along.

00:09:47.150 --> 00:09:49.150
Thank you.

00:09:49.150 --> 00:09:51.150
(Applause)

00:09:51.150 --> 00:09:53.150
Thank you.

00:09:53.150 --> 00:09:55.150
Thank you.

00:09:55.150 --> 00:10:06.150
Thank you.

00:10:06.150 --> 00:10:10.150
Well, I'm staying here because

00:10:10.150 --> 00:10:13.150
we wanted to demonstrate to you

00:10:13.150 --> 00:10:16.150
the power of this technology

00:10:16.150 --> 00:10:19.150
and so, while I've been speaking,

00:10:19.150 --> 00:10:22.150
you have been scanned.

00:10:22.150 --> 00:10:25.150
(Laughter)

00:10:26.150 --> 00:10:29.150
The two wizards that I have

00:10:29.150 --> 00:10:31.150
that are behind the curtain

00:10:31.150 --> 00:10:34.150
will help me bring

00:10:34.150 --> 00:10:39.150
the results on the screen.

00:10:42.150 --> 00:10:49.150
(Applause)

00:10:49.150 --> 00:10:52.150
This is all in 3D and of course

00:10:52.150 --> 00:10:55.150
you can fly through the cloud of points.

00:10:55.150 --> 00:10:57.150
You can look at it from on top,

00:10:57.150 --> 00:10:59.150
from the ceiling.

00:10:59.150 --> 00:11:01.150
You can look from different vantage points,

00:11:01.150 --> 00:11:04.150
but I'm going to ask Doug to zoom in

00:11:04.150 --> 00:11:07.150
on an individual in the crowd,

00:11:07.150 --> 00:11:10.150
just to show the amount of detail

00:11:10.150 --> 00:11:13.150
that we can create.

00:11:16.150 --> 00:11:19.150
So you have been digitally preserved

00:11:19.150 --> 00:11:21.150
in about four minutes.

00:11:21.150 --> 00:11:23.150
(Laughter)

00:11:23.150 --> 00:11:27.150
I'd like to thank the wizards here.

00:11:27.150 --> 00:11:30.150
We were very lucky to have

00:11:30.150 --> 00:11:34.150
two of our partners participate in this:

00:11:34.150 --> 00:11:36.150
the Historic Scotland,

00:11:36.150 --> 00:11:39.150
and the Glasgow School of Art.

00:11:39.150 --> 00:11:43.150
I'd like to also thank personally

00:11:43.150 --> 00:11:47.150
the efforts of David Mitchell,

00:11:47.150 --> 00:11:50.150
who is the Director of Conservation

00:11:50.150 --> 00:11:52.150
at Historic Scotland.

00:11:52.150 --> 00:11:54.150
David.

00:11:54.150 --> 00:11:57.150
(Applause)

00:11:59.150 --> 00:12:01.150
And Doug Pritchard, who's the Head of

00:12:01.150 --> 00:12:04.150
Visualization at the Glasgow School of Art.

00:12:04.150 --> 00:12:06.150
Let's give them a hand.

00:12:06.150 --> 00:12:09.150
(Applause)

00:12:09.150 --> 00:12:12.150
Thank you.
