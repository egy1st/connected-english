00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:16.150
Let me introduce to you Rezero.

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:18.150
This little fellow was developed

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:20.150
by a group of 10 undergraduate students

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:22.150
at the Autonomous Systems Laboratory

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:24.150
at ETH-Zurich.

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.150
Our robot belongs to a family of robots

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:28.150
called Ballbots.

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:30.150
Instead of wheels, a Ballbot is balancing

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.150
and moving on one single ball.

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:34.150
The main characteristics of such a system is

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:37.150
that there's one sole contact point to the ground.

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:39.150
This means that the robot

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:41.150
is inherently unstable.

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:43.150
It's like when I am trying to stand

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:44.150
on one foot.

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:46.150
You might ask yourself, what's the usefulness

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:48.150
of a robot that's unstable?

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:50.150
Now we'll explain that in a second.

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:52.150
Let me first explain how Rezero

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:54.150
actually keeps his balance.

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:56.150
Rezero keeps his balance by constantly

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:59.150
measuring his pitch angle with a sensor.

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:02.150
He then counteracts and avoids toppling over

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:04.150
by turning the motors appropriately.

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:06.150
This happens 160 times per second,

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.150
and if anything fails in this process,

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:11.150
Rezero would immediately fall to the ground.

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:13.150
Now to move and to balance,

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:15.150
Rezero needs to turn the ball.

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.150
The ball is driven by three special wheels

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:20.150
that allow Rezero to move into any direction

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:22.150
and also move around his own axis

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:26.150
at the same time.

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:28.150
Due to his instability, Rezero is always

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:30.150
in motion. Now here's the trick.

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.150
It's indeed exactly this instability that allows

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.150
a robot to move very [dynamically].

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:37.150
Let's play a little.

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:39.150
You may have wondered what happens

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:42.150
if I give the robot a little push.

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:46.150
In this mode, he's trying to maintain

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:49.150
his position.

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:52.150
For the next demo, I'd like you to introduce

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:55.150
to my colleagues Michael, on the computer,

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:58.150
and Thomas who's helping me onstage.

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:01.150
In the next mode, Rezero is passive,

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:04.150
and we can move him around.

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:07.150
With almost no force I can control

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:10.150
his position and his velocity.

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:16.150
I can also make him spin.

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:29.150
In the next mode, we can get Rezero

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:32.150
to follow a person.

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:35.150
He's now keeping a constant distance to Thomas.

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:41.150
This works with a laser sensor

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:43.150
that's mounted on top of Rezero.

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:49.150
With the same method, we can also

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:52.150
get him to circle a person.

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:58.150
We call this the orbiting mode.

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:09.150
All right, thank you, Thomas.

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:13.150
(Applause)

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:16.150
Now, what's the use of this technology?

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:21.150
For now, it's an experiment, but let me

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:24.150
show you some possible future applications.

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:27.150
Rezero could be used in exhibitions or parks.

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:29.150
With a screen it could inform people or show

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:32.150
them around in a fun and entertaining way.

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:34.150
In a hospital, this device could be used to

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:36.150
carry around medical equipment.

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:38.150
Due to the Ballbot system, it has a very small

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:41.150
footprint and it's also easy to move around.

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:43.150
And of course, who wouldn't like

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:46.150
to take a ride on one of these.

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:48.150
And these are more practical applications.

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:50.150
But there's also a certain beauty

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:52.150
within this technology.

00:03:52.150 --> 00:04:01.150
(Music)

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:56.150
(Applause)

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:58.150
Thank you.

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:02.150
(Applause)

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:04.150
Thank you.
