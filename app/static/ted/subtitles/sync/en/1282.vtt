00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:14.150
Ladies and gentlemen, gather around.

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:17.150
I would love to share with you a story.

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:19.150
Once upon a time

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:21.150
in 19th century Germany,

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.150
there was the book.

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:25.150
Now during this time,

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:27.150
the book was the king of storytelling.

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.150
It was venerable.

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:31.150
It was ubiquitous.

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:35.150
But it was a little bit boring.

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:38.150
Because in its 400 years of existence,

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:40.150
storytellers never evolved the book

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:42.150
as a storytelling device.

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:44.150
But then one author arrived,

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:48.150
and he changed the game forever.

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:50.150
(Music)

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:52.150
His name was Lothar,

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:55.150
Lothar Meggendorfer.

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:58.150
Lothar Meggendorfer put his foot down,

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:01.150
and he said, "Genug ist genug!"

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:06.150
He grabbed his pen,

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.150
he snatched his scissors.

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:10.150
This man refused to fold to the conventions of normalcy

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:12.150
and just decided to fold.

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.150
History would know Lothar Meggendorfer

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:16.150
as -- who else? --

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:18.150
the world's first true inventor

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:21.150
of the children's pop-up book.

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.150
(Music)

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:25.150
For this delight and for this wonder,

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:27.150
people rejoiced.

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:30.150
(Cheering)

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.150
They were happy because the story survived,

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.150
and that the world would keep on spinning.

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:37.150
Lothar Meggendorfer wasn't the first

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:39.150
to evolve the way a story was told,

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.150
and he certainly wasn't the last.

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:43.150
Whether storytellers realized it or not,

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:45.150
they were channeling Meggendorfer's spirit

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:50.150
when they moved opera to vaudville,

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:53.150
radio news to radio theater,

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:56.150
film to film in motion

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:59.150
to film in sound, color, 3D,

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:01.150
on VHS and on DVD.

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:04.150
There seemed to be no cure for this Meggendorferitis.

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:07.150
And things got a lot more fun when the Internet came around.

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:09.150
(Laughter)

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:12.150
Because, not only could people broadcast their stories throughout the world,

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:14.150
but they could do so

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:17.150
using what seemed to be an infinite amount of devices.

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:20.150
For example, one company

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:22.150
would tell a story of love

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:25.150
through its very own search engine.

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:29.150
One Taiwanese production studio

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:32.150
would interpret American politics in 3D.

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:37.150
(Laughter)

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:41.150
And one man would tell the stories of his father

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:43.150
by using a platform called Twitter

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:46.150
to communicate the excrement his father would gesticulate.

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:48.150
And after all this, everyone paused;

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:50.150
they took a step back.

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:53.150
They realized that, in 6,000 years of storytelling,

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:57.150
they've gone from depicting hunting on cave walls

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:01.150
to depicting Shakespeare on Facebook walls.

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:04.150
And this was a cause for celebration.

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:06.150
The art of storytelling has remained unchanged.

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:09.150
And for the most part, the stories are recycled.

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:11.150
But the way that humans tell the stories

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:13.150
has always evolved

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:16.150
with pure, consistent novelty.

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:18.150
And they remembered a man,

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:21.150
one amazing German,

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:25.150
every time a new storytelling device

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:27.150
popped up next.

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:29.150
And for that,

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:31.150
the audience --

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:33.150
the lovely, beautiful audience --

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:36.150
would live happily ever after.

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:41.150
(Applause)
