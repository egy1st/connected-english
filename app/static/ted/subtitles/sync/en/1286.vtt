00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:14.150
Meet Tony. He's my student.

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:16.150
He's about my age,

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:19.150
and he's in San Quentin State Prison.

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:22.150
When Tony was 16 years old,

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:25.150
one day, one moment,

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:27.150
"It was mom's gun.

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.150
Just flash it, scare the guy. He's a punk.

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:31.150
He took some money; we'll take his money. That'll teach him.

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:34.150
Then last minute, I'm thinking, 'Can't do this. This is wrong.'

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:36.150
My buddy says, 'C'mon, let's do this.'

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:40.150
I say, 'Let's do this.'"

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:43.150
And those three words, Tony's going to remember,

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:45.150
because the next thing he knows, he hears the pop.

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:47.150
There's the punk on the ground, puddle of blood.

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:49.150
And that's felony murder --

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:51.150
25 to life, parole at 50 if you're lucky,

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:54.150
and Tony's not feeling very lucky.

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:57.150
So when we meet in my philosophy class in his prison

00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:01.150
and I say, "In this class, we will discuss the foundations of ethics,"

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:03.150
Tony interrupts me.

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:05.150
"What are you going to teach me about right and wrong?

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:08.150
I know what is wrong. I have done wrong.

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:10.150
I am told every day,

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:13.150
by every face I see, every wall I face, that I am wrong.

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:16.150
If I ever get out of here, there will always be a mark by my name.

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:18.150
I'm a convict; I am branded 'wrong.'

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:21.150
What are you going to tell me about right and wrong?"

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:24.150
So I say to Tony,

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.150
"Sorry, but it's worse than you think.

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.150
You think you know right and wrong?

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:31.150
Then can you tell me what wrong is?

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:33.150
No, don't just give me an example.

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:36.150
I want to know about wrongness itself, the idea of wrong.

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.150
What is that idea?

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:40.150
What makes something wrong?

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:43.150
How do we know that it's wrong? Maybe you and I disagree.

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:45.150
Maybe one of us is wrong about the wrong.

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:47.150
Maybe it's you, maybe it's me -- but we're not here to trade opinions;

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:49.150
everyone's got an opinion.

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:51.150
We are here for knowledge.

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:55.150
Our enemy is thoughtlessness. This is philosophy."

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:58.150
And something changes for Tony.

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:03.150
"Could be I'm wrong. I'm tired of being wrong.

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:05.150
I want to know what is wrong.

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:07.150
I want to know what I know."

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:10.150
What Tony sees in that moment is the project of philosophy,

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:12.150
the project that begins in wonder --

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:14.150
what Kant called "admiration and awe

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:17.150
at the starry sky above and the moral law within."

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:19.150
What can creatures like us know of such things?

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:22.150
It is the project that always takes us back to the condition of existence --

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:25.150
what Heidegger called "the always already there."

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:28.150
It is the project of questioning what we believe and why we believe it --

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:30.150
what Socrates called "the examined life."

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:33.150
Socrates, a man wise enough to know that he knows nothing.

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:36.150
Socrates died in prison,

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:39.150
his philosophy intact.

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:41.150
So Tony starts doing his homework.

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:43.150
He learns his whys and wherefores, his causes and correlations,

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:45.150
his logic, his fallacies.

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:47.150
Turns out, Tony's got the philosophy muscle.

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:49.150
His body is in prison, but his mind is free.

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:51.150
Tony learns about the ontologically promiscuous,

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:53.150
the epistemologically anxious,

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:56.150
the ethically dubious, the metaphysically ridiculous.

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:58.150
That's Plato, Descartes, Nietzsche

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:00.150
and Bill Clinton.

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:03.150
So when he gives me his final paper,

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:05.150
in which he argues that the categorical imperative

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:07.150
is perhaps too uncompromising

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:09.150
to deal with the conflict that affects our everyday

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:11.150
and challenges me to tell him

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:13.150
whether therefore we are condemned to moral failure,

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:15.150
I say, "I don't know.

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:17.150
Let us think about that."

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:19.150
Because in that moment, there's no mark by Tony's name;

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:21.150
it's just the two of us standing there.

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:23.150
It is not professor and convict,

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:25.150
it is just two minds ready to do philosophy.

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:27.150
And I say to Tony,

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:30.150
"Let's do this."

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:32.150
Thank you.

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:41.150
(Applause)
