00:00:13.187 --> 00:00:15.151
I hope you're all healthy,

00:00:15.175 --> 00:00:19.352
and I hope we will all remain healthy
for the indefinite future.

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:22.720
But that hope is a little bit unrealistic,

00:00:22.744 --> 00:00:24.710
and so I've got a second back-up hope.

00:00:24.734 --> 00:00:28.872
The second back-up hope is that,
insofar as we have health problems,

00:00:28.896 --> 00:00:32.231
we will have good medicines
to take care of them.

00:00:32.255 --> 00:00:36.623
Medicines are very cheap to produce
and they're very effective --

00:00:36.647 --> 00:00:39.790
much more pleasant, actually,
than the alternatives:

00:00:39.814 --> 00:00:43.866
hospitalization, operations,
emergency rooms, the morgue ...

00:00:44.421 --> 00:00:45.987
None of these are good things.

00:00:46.011 --> 00:00:49.602
So we should be very grateful
that we have pharmacologists around,

00:00:49.626 --> 00:00:52.543
people who research these things
and develop new medicines.

00:00:53.163 --> 00:00:56.926
And we should be grateful
that we have a pharmaceutical industry

00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:59.041
that supports their activities.

00:00:59.749 --> 00:01:02.784
But there is a problem,
and you can tell from the fact

00:01:02.808 --> 00:01:05.258
that the pharmaceutical
industry isn't well-loved.

00:01:05.282 --> 00:01:10.242
In fact, in terms of popularity, they rank
just about with the tobacco companies

00:01:10.266 --> 00:01:12.006
and the arms manufacturers.

00:01:12.502 --> 00:01:16.320
So that's the problem
I want to talk with you about today.

00:01:17.534 --> 00:01:20.337
How would you organize
the pharmaceutical industry?

00:01:20.361 --> 00:01:22.763
If we did it all over again,
how would you do it?

00:01:22.787 --> 00:01:25.888
I think we would think
of three main principles.

00:01:26.352 --> 00:01:27.519
The first one is:

00:01:27.543 --> 00:01:31.889
we want patients to have access
to all the important medicines.

00:01:31.913 --> 00:01:34.687
Remember, these things
are very cheap to produce.

00:01:34.711 --> 00:01:37.436
So everybody in the world
should have access

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:39.754
to all the important medicines.

00:01:40.231 --> 00:01:43.139
Secondly, we want innovative activities,

00:01:43.163 --> 00:01:46.995
the research and development
that pharmaceutical companies do,

00:01:47.019 --> 00:01:50.697
to track the diseases that are
the most important, the most damaging.

00:01:50.721 --> 00:01:53.792
We want them to aim
for the greatest health impact.

00:01:54.406 --> 00:01:57.696
And thirdly, we want
the whole system to be efficient.

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:02.548
We want as little of the money
that goes into the system to go to waste,

00:02:02.572 --> 00:02:06.078
to go for overhead,
for red tape, and so on and so forth.

00:02:06.634 --> 00:02:08.572
Very simple three points.

00:02:09.786 --> 00:02:11.746
Now what about the existing system?

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:15.369
I think it does poorly
on all these three counts.

00:02:15.393 --> 00:02:17.984
First, universal access: forget about it.

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:22.682
The vast majority of human beings
do not have access to medicines,

00:02:22.706 --> 00:02:25.059
at least while they're still under patent.

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:30.075
There are extremely high markups,
and that's the problem.

00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:34.028
The problem is that even though
these medicines are very cheap to produce,

00:02:34.052 --> 00:02:38.417
they cost a great amount of money
during the time that they're under patent,

00:02:38.441 --> 00:02:43.154
and the reason for that is
that rich people can pay a lot of money.

00:02:43.178 --> 00:02:45.770
Pharmaceutical companies
have a temporary monopoly;

00:02:45.794 --> 00:02:48.838
they price for the rich,
they forget about the poor.

00:02:49.484 --> 00:02:51.779
The second problem is innovation.

00:02:52.232 --> 00:02:56.805
Again, we don't focus on the diseases
that do the most damage,

00:02:56.829 --> 00:03:01.528
and that's often put
into the phrase "the 10/90 gap."

00:03:01.552 --> 00:03:05.235
Ten percent of all the money spent
on pharmaceutical research

00:03:05.259 --> 00:03:08.386
is focusing on diseases
that account for ninety percent

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:10.522
of the global burden of disease.

00:03:10.546 --> 00:03:14.264
And vice versa -- ninety percent
of the money is spent on diseases

00:03:14.288 --> 00:03:17.927
that account for only ten percent
of the global burden of disease.

00:03:17.951 --> 00:03:22.648
So there's a huge mismatch between
where we spend the research money

00:03:22.672 --> 00:03:25.309
and where the greatest problems are.

00:03:25.928 --> 00:03:27.324
Now, both these problems --

00:03:27.348 --> 00:03:30.093
the problem with innovation
and the problem with access --

00:03:30.117 --> 00:03:31.532
have to do with this:

00:03:32.268 --> 00:03:34.191
the distribution of money in the world.

00:03:34.215 --> 00:03:35.508
It's extremely unequal.

00:03:35.532 --> 00:03:39.871
The blue area here is the top quarter
of the human population.

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:43.988
They have more than ninety percent
of the global household income.

00:03:44.549 --> 00:03:47.026
The bottom half of humanity,
on the other hand,

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:50.349
has not even three percent
of global household income.

00:03:50.373 --> 00:03:54.808
So if you're a pharmaceutical company
and you look for profit opportunities,

00:03:54.832 --> 00:03:57.778
you look at this sort of chart and say,
"Where's the money?

00:03:57.802 --> 00:03:59.385
What am I going to research?

00:03:59.409 --> 00:04:01.799
Who am I going to provide with medicines?"

00:04:03.132 --> 00:04:06.884
And again, that is in the context
of there being only one way

00:04:06.908 --> 00:04:10.333
in which pharmaceutical companies
make money under the present system,

00:04:10.357 --> 00:04:12.529
that is, through patent-protected markups.

00:04:12.553 --> 00:04:14.972
That's how they make their money,
through markups.

00:04:14.996 --> 00:04:17.039
And if you make money through markups,

00:04:17.063 --> 00:04:21.890
then obviously, you will go to where
the people have the most income.

00:04:23.382 --> 00:04:25.124
Now in terms of overall efficiency,

00:04:25.148 --> 00:04:28.101
the system also does very, very poorly.

00:04:28.703 --> 00:04:31.294
A lot of money goes
for lobbying politicians

00:04:31.318 --> 00:04:35.051
in order to extend patent periods --
to "evergreen," as it's called.

00:04:35.075 --> 00:04:36.763
Data exclusivity and so on.

00:04:36.787 --> 00:04:38.297
A lot of money goes for gaming,

00:04:38.321 --> 00:04:44.169
where brand-name companies pay generic
companies to delay entry, for example.

00:04:44.193 --> 00:04:48.088
A lot of money goes to take our patents
in all the different jurisdictions.

00:04:48.112 --> 00:04:50.682
Money goes – even larger
amounts – for litigation.

00:04:50.706 --> 00:04:52.258
They're litigating endlessly --

00:04:52.282 --> 00:04:54.456
brand-name company
against brand-name company,

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:56.781
brand-name company
against generic company ...

00:04:56.805 --> 00:04:58.194
Enormous amounts go there.

00:04:58.218 --> 00:05:01.287
People say pharmaceutical companies
make a lot of profit.

00:05:01.311 --> 00:05:06.196
Well, yes and no; they do, but a lot of it
goes to these wasteful activities.

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:08.967
Deadweight losses -- I won't
even tell you what they are,

00:05:08.991 --> 00:05:10.418
because it's too complicated.

00:05:10.442 --> 00:05:13.049
But there's also wasteful marketing.

00:05:13.073 --> 00:05:16.326
A lot of the money
that pharmaceutical companies make

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:18.122
goes into advertising campaigns,

00:05:18.146 --> 00:05:19.899
trying to win favor with doctors,

00:05:19.923 --> 00:05:22.568
trying to persuade patients
to try this medicine.

00:05:23.008 --> 00:05:25.773
And these marketing battles,
of course, are a pure waste,

00:05:25.797 --> 00:05:29.082
because what one company spends
to get patients over to their drug,

00:05:29.106 --> 00:05:31.088
another company spends to win them back.

00:05:31.491 --> 00:05:34.372
And then there is counterfeiting
in the developing countries.

00:05:34.396 --> 00:05:37.777
A lot of the drugs there, often more than
fifty percent of what's sold,

00:05:37.801 --> 00:05:39.769
are counterfeit drugs, where people say,

00:05:39.793 --> 00:05:43.188
"Because the drug is so expensive,
I can offer you a cheaper version."

00:05:43.212 --> 00:05:45.108
But of course it's not the real thing,

00:05:45.132 --> 00:05:47.698
it's either diluted
or it's completely inert.

00:05:47.722 --> 00:05:51.400
So on the whole, all the money
that is spent on pharmaceuticals --

00:05:51.424 --> 00:05:54.736
and it's roughly a trillion dollars
now, per annum --

00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:57.747
much of that money
is absolutely going to waste,

00:05:57.771 --> 00:05:59.866
it's not going to where
it should be going,

00:05:59.890 --> 00:06:02.216
namely, to the development
of new medicines

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:05.264
and to the manufacturing
of ones that we already have.

00:06:06.211 --> 00:06:08.784
Now, many people think
that the solution to the problem

00:06:08.808 --> 00:06:11.742
is moral pressure
on pharmaceutical companies.

00:06:12.869 --> 00:06:16.172
And, sure -- pharmaceutical companies
have moral obligations,

00:06:16.196 --> 00:06:17.597
just like we do.

00:06:17.621 --> 00:06:19.064
When we have to make a choice,

00:06:19.088 --> 00:06:22.485
often between having a little extra money
and saving a human life,

00:06:23.255 --> 00:06:26.569
we often feel that we have a duty
to spend the money

00:06:26.593 --> 00:06:27.887
and save the life.

00:06:27.911 --> 00:06:30.897
And why should pharmaceutical
companies be any different?

00:06:31.813 --> 00:06:36.323
But really, it isn't realistic
to expect pharmaceutical companies

00:06:36.347 --> 00:06:39.794
to act as well as you
or maybe I might act.

00:06:40.492 --> 00:06:42.130
And the reason is threefold.

00:06:42.755 --> 00:06:46.924
One is that pharmaceutical companies
are bound to their shareholders.

00:06:47.591 --> 00:06:50.819
The executive of such a company
wouldn't last very long

00:06:50.843 --> 00:06:55.107
if he gave a lot of money away,
or she, for good purposes,

00:06:55.131 --> 00:06:59.043
and thereby lost money
for the shareholders.

00:06:59.067 --> 00:07:00.375
They would be replaced.

00:07:01.055 --> 00:07:04.868
Also, pharmaceutical companies stand
in fierce competition with one another,

00:07:04.892 --> 00:07:08.257
and if you do more, if you are nicer
than the other company,

00:07:08.281 --> 00:07:10.825
sooner or later, you'll be
driven out of the market.

00:07:10.849 --> 00:07:12.008
You will not survive.

00:07:12.032 --> 00:07:14.245
The other company will gain market share.

00:07:15.444 --> 00:07:16.971
And finally, remember --

00:07:16.995 --> 00:07:20.047
the entire industry
is dependent for its income

00:07:20.071 --> 00:07:22.341
on one thing and one thing only: markups.

00:07:23.118 --> 00:07:26.903
And ultimately, you have
to be sustainable.

00:07:26.927 --> 00:07:29.262
If you spend a lot of money
on helping poor people

00:07:29.286 --> 00:07:31.900
and you don't get paid for it,
and you lose this money;

00:07:31.924 --> 00:07:36.035
you cannot continue
with your innovative activities.

00:07:36.606 --> 00:07:38.863
So for these reasons,
it's just unrealistic

00:07:38.887 --> 00:07:42.378
to expect that pharmaceutical companies
will solve the problem

00:07:42.402 --> 00:07:44.034
on moral grounds.

00:07:44.058 --> 00:07:45.839
Who, then, should solve the problem?

00:07:45.863 --> 00:07:47.308
I suggest it has to be us.

00:07:47.812 --> 00:07:51.567
We, citizens and politicians,
have to do better

00:07:51.591 --> 00:07:54.714
in terms of regulating
the pharmaceutical industry,

00:07:54.738 --> 00:07:57.370
focusing them,
giving them the right incentives,

00:07:57.394 --> 00:08:00.136
focusing them on the problems
that really matter.

00:08:01.602 --> 00:08:04.628
The potential gains here are enormous.

00:08:04.652 --> 00:08:09.208
About one third of all deaths
each day, each year,

00:08:09.232 --> 00:08:12.644
are due to the diseases of poverty
in the developing world.

00:08:12.668 --> 00:08:18.692
Fifty thousand people every day
die prematurely from these diseases.

00:08:19.272 --> 00:08:21.841
And that's not even counting
all the diseases

00:08:21.865 --> 00:08:24.387
that we know only too well
in the rich countries:

00:08:24.411 --> 00:08:26.329
cancer, heart disease and so on.

00:08:26.353 --> 00:08:28.976
Again, poor people die often much earlier,

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:32.800
because they don't have good medical care,
including good medicines.

00:08:33.822 --> 00:08:38.224
And even in rich countries, many patients
are not getting the best medicine.

00:08:38.248 --> 00:08:41.726
That's sometimes due to the fact
that insurance companies won't cover it,

00:08:41.750 --> 00:08:44.446
because the price
is so absolutely ridiculous.

00:08:44.470 --> 00:08:46.042
And it's also due, sometimes,

00:08:46.066 --> 00:08:49.725
to the fact that doctors
and patients are falsely influenced

00:08:49.749 --> 00:08:52.985
by advertising campaigns
of pharmaceutical companies.

00:08:54.319 --> 00:08:57.126
So what can we do?
How can we change the system?

00:08:57.150 --> 00:09:00.767
I want to show you a way
in which we can better incentivize

00:09:00.791 --> 00:09:04.263
pharmaceutical innovation and
the provision [of] medicines

00:09:04.287 --> 00:09:06.253
to poor people and rich alike.

00:09:06.914 --> 00:09:08.797
And that is the Health Impact Fund.

00:09:08.821 --> 00:09:12.783
The Health Impact Fund is basically
opening up the second track

00:09:12.807 --> 00:09:17.207
with which pharmaceutical innovators
can be rewarded for their activities.

00:09:17.231 --> 00:09:18.397
They have a choice.

00:09:18.421 --> 00:09:23.092
They can either go with the old system,
with patent-protected markups,

00:09:23.116 --> 00:09:25.505
or they can go with the new system,

00:09:25.529 --> 00:09:28.227
being rewarded on the basis
of the health impact

00:09:28.251 --> 00:09:30.353
of the medicines that they develop.

00:09:30.973 --> 00:09:33.841
And with each particular medicine,
they have their choice.

00:09:33.865 --> 00:09:36.912
So they can be partly on one track,
partly on the other,

00:09:36.936 --> 00:09:38.398
with different products.

00:09:38.422 --> 00:09:41.115
Now, how would
the Health Impact Fund work?

00:09:42.195 --> 00:09:44.423
There would be a fixed
reward pool every year.

00:09:44.447 --> 00:09:46.447
We start with maybe six billion dollars,

00:09:46.471 --> 00:09:48.266
but that can eventually be revved up.

00:09:48.290 --> 00:09:51.933
Remember that the total money
that the world spends on pharmaceuticals

00:09:51.957 --> 00:09:53.115
is a trillion.

00:09:53.139 --> 00:09:56.189
So it's a thousand billion;
six billion is a drop in the bucket.

00:09:56.213 --> 00:09:58.954
It's relatively small,
but it would work with six billion,

00:09:58.978 --> 00:10:02.742
and we'd get a lot of bang for the buck
if we introduced the Health Impact Fund

00:10:02.766 --> 00:10:04.404
with just six billion dollars.

00:10:05.056 --> 00:10:08.592
If you have a product
and you want to register it

00:10:08.616 --> 00:10:10.328
with the Health Impact Fund,

00:10:10.352 --> 00:10:13.743
you will be rewarded
for a period of 10 years.

00:10:13.767 --> 00:10:19.523
During these 10 years, you get a share
of these annual reward pools.

00:10:19.547 --> 00:10:24.957
That share would be proportional to
your share of the health impact achieved

00:10:24.981 --> 00:10:26.850
by all these registered products.

00:10:27.312 --> 00:10:31.957
So if your product accounts
for eight percent of the health impact

00:10:31.981 --> 00:10:34.076
of all the registered products,

00:10:34.100 --> 00:10:37.784
you get eight percent
of the reward money that year.

00:10:37.808 --> 00:10:39.685
That repeats for 10 years,

00:10:39.709 --> 00:10:43.037
and at the end of the 10 years,
your product goes generic,

00:10:43.061 --> 00:10:46.375
so you basically lose
any further income from it.

00:10:48.231 --> 00:10:52.300
Each year, the health impact
from your product would be evaluated,

00:10:52.324 --> 00:10:54.923
and you would be paid on that basis.

00:10:55.646 --> 00:10:59.099
Now, if you take that reward
from the Health Impact Fund,

00:10:59.123 --> 00:11:02.077
you can't claim the other reward,
you can't mark up the price.

00:11:02.101 --> 00:11:03.587
You have to sell at cost.

00:11:03.611 --> 00:11:05.202
What does that mean?

00:11:05.853 --> 00:11:08.763
Well, it doesn't mean
that the pharmaceutical company tells us

00:11:08.787 --> 00:11:09.951
what their cost is;

00:11:09.975 --> 00:11:14.172
but rather, our preferred way
of determining what the real cost is

00:11:14.196 --> 00:11:16.953
of making a medicine, of manufacturing it,

00:11:16.977 --> 00:11:20.610
is to ask the registrant to put
the production of the medicine

00:11:20.634 --> 00:11:25.828
out for tender, let generic companies
compete for the production,

00:11:25.852 --> 00:11:29.796
and then the innovator would buy
the product from the cheapest supplier

00:11:29.820 --> 00:11:35.197
and would sell it at that same
lowest possible price to patients.

00:11:35.912 --> 00:11:40.900
So the innovator would make no money
at all on selling the product,

00:11:40.924 --> 00:11:45.265
but would make all its money
from the health impact rewards.

00:11:46.279 --> 00:11:50.697
Now, how do we assess the impact
of the introduction of a medicine?

00:11:51.439 --> 00:11:55.198
Well, we assess it relative
to the preceding state of the art.

00:11:55.222 --> 00:11:57.890
So some people,
before the medicine came along,

00:11:57.914 --> 00:11:59.252
had no treatment at all.

00:11:59.276 --> 00:12:02.305
Now for the first time, they have
treatment, because it's cheap;

00:12:02.329 --> 00:12:03.549
people can afford it.

00:12:03.573 --> 00:12:06.970
So here, the impact is the difference
between being treated

00:12:06.994 --> 00:12:08.321
and not being treated.

00:12:08.916 --> 00:12:12.586
In other cases, the new product
is better than the old products,

00:12:12.610 --> 00:12:15.738
and so a person gets switched over
to a better product,

00:12:15.762 --> 00:12:20.089
and we pay for the impact,
for the difference the new product makes.

00:12:20.898 --> 00:12:23.186
If you have a product
on the Health Impact Fund

00:12:23.210 --> 00:12:25.900
and you simply switch somebody
from an existing product

00:12:25.924 --> 00:12:28.770
to another product, to your product,
and it's no better,

00:12:28.794 --> 00:12:29.950
you get no money.

00:12:29.974 --> 00:12:32.906
That's in stark contrast
to the existing system,

00:12:32.930 --> 00:12:36.291
where you get a lot of money
for switching somebody from one product

00:12:36.315 --> 00:12:39.077
to an equal product that is your product.

00:12:39.550 --> 00:12:42.236
The Health Impact Fund
does not pay for that.

00:12:43.585 --> 00:12:47.221
We quantify health impact in terms
of quality-adjusted life years.

00:12:47.245 --> 00:12:49.704
That method has been around
for about 20 years,

00:12:49.728 --> 00:12:51.256
and it's very easy to explain.

00:12:51.280 --> 00:12:53.901
Just think of a human life
as a kind of plank.

00:12:53.925 --> 00:12:56.656
It's eighty inches long, one inch high.

00:12:56.680 --> 00:12:59.152
And when you die prematurely
before you reach 80,

00:12:59.176 --> 00:13:01.112
well, the plank is a little shorter.

00:13:01.136 --> 00:13:04.238
And if you're sick during
the time that you live,

00:13:04.262 --> 00:13:06.072
the plank is a little bit thinner.

00:13:06.838 --> 00:13:10.538
And what diseases can nibble away,
medicines can restore,

00:13:10.562 --> 00:13:14.813
or medicines can avert
the taking away of these parts.

00:13:15.353 --> 00:13:17.667
And they get paid for that.

00:13:17.691 --> 00:13:19.363
That's the method, basically.

00:13:20.958 --> 00:13:24.461
Now, we look – of course,
each year, we have to assess.

00:13:24.485 --> 00:13:26.690
We have to spend
a considerable amount of money

00:13:26.714 --> 00:13:28.532
looking at how these various medicines

00:13:28.556 --> 00:13:30.759
that are registered
with the Health Impact Fund

00:13:30.783 --> 00:13:32.297
are doing in various countries.

00:13:32.321 --> 00:13:34.366
And here, statistics is extremely helpful.

00:13:34.390 --> 00:13:38.096
You all know how exit polling works.
This is a similar method.

00:13:38.120 --> 00:13:41.655
You look for a statistically
significant sample,

00:13:41.679 --> 00:13:45.644
and then try to figure out
what the health impact of the medicine is

00:13:45.668 --> 00:13:48.711
in different locations,
in different demographic groups ...

00:13:48.735 --> 00:13:51.759
And, of course, you look very carefully
at the actual world --

00:13:51.783 --> 00:13:56.353
this is in contrast to how medicines
are today rewarded.

00:13:56.377 --> 00:13:59.053
Sometimes, there is a reward
based on performance,

00:13:59.077 --> 00:14:03.611
but it's the performance in clinical
trials, in the laboratory, if you like,

00:14:03.635 --> 00:14:06.627
and not the performance in the real world.

00:14:06.651 --> 00:14:10.664
The Health Impact Fund
would look at real-world impact.

00:14:10.688 --> 00:14:13.870
It would look not just
at the quality of a drug,

00:14:13.894 --> 00:14:17.465
but also at how widely it is distributed,

00:14:17.489 --> 00:14:20.840
whether the innovator manages
to target those patients

00:14:20.864 --> 00:14:23.124
who can benefit the most,

00:14:23.148 --> 00:14:26.760
and also, how well the drug
is used in the field.

00:14:26.784 --> 00:14:30.937
So innovators would have much
stronger incentives than they do now

00:14:30.961 --> 00:14:33.428
to make sure that every patient
who takes the drug

00:14:33.452 --> 00:14:36.443
knows exactly how to take it
to optimal effect.

00:14:36.467 --> 00:14:41.171
Today, most packaged inserts are not even
translated into local languages,

00:14:41.195 --> 00:14:46.086
and so it's not surprising that patients
don't make the best use of the product.

00:14:47.705 --> 00:14:49.713
Now, how would the financing work?

00:14:50.519 --> 00:14:53.483
Basically, the Health Impact Fund,
as I said, could start

00:14:53.507 --> 00:14:55.466
with something like six billion dollars.

00:14:55.490 --> 00:14:57.883
It's not nothing, but it's also
not a lot of money,

00:14:57.907 --> 00:15:01.018
compared to what the world is already
spending on pharmaceuticals.

00:15:01.042 --> 00:15:03.864
So the best way to think of it
is as a new way of paying

00:15:03.888 --> 00:15:07.047
for what we are already paying for,
namely, new medicines.

00:15:07.071 --> 00:15:09.817
You pay with one hand
through the tax system,

00:15:09.841 --> 00:15:12.442
but you get something back
with the other hand,

00:15:12.466 --> 00:15:14.891
because you also get
these medicines for cheap.

00:15:14.915 --> 00:15:16.635
This is not just for poor people --

00:15:16.659 --> 00:15:21.746
everybody will have these Health Impact
Fund registered medicines at cost,

00:15:21.770 --> 00:15:23.649
at a very low price.

00:15:24.799 --> 00:15:29.849
One very important hurdle here,
politically, is that we have to make sure

00:15:29.873 --> 00:15:33.148
that we have long-term
visibility for innovators,

00:15:33.172 --> 00:15:35.884
that innovators know
that the money is actually there,

00:15:35.908 --> 00:15:40.069
and so we need governments
to fund the Health Impact Fund,

00:15:40.093 --> 00:15:43.123
because only governments can make
predictable commitments

00:15:43.147 --> 00:15:45.217
for a long period of time.

00:15:45.849 --> 00:15:50.643
Because the Health Impact Fund
registration is voluntary,

00:15:50.667 --> 00:15:54.206
you basically have
a self-adjusting reward rate.

00:15:54.230 --> 00:15:57.367
As the rate rises too high,

00:15:58.279 --> 00:16:01.101
innovators will come in
and drive the rate down.

00:16:01.125 --> 00:16:03.644
Conversely, if the rate falls too low,

00:16:03.668 --> 00:16:07.408
innovators would be reluctant
to register, and the rate will recover.

00:16:07.432 --> 00:16:10.810
So the rate will always be
at a reasonable level.

00:16:11.969 --> 00:16:15.313
The Health Impact Fund
is beneficial for all parties.

00:16:15.337 --> 00:16:19.169
It benefits innovators
by giving them a new market,

00:16:19.193 --> 00:16:23.248
and most importantly, by overcoming
their public relations problems

00:16:23.272 --> 00:16:24.588
that we started with.

00:16:25.348 --> 00:16:26.899
It benefits patients,

00:16:26.923 --> 00:16:30.295
because patients are much more likely
to get the right medicine,

00:16:30.319 --> 00:16:33.281
and also for these
medicines to be developed,

00:16:33.305 --> 00:16:35.104
the medicines that we most need.

00:16:35.808 --> 00:16:39.217
And it also benefits governments
or taxpayers, if you like,

00:16:39.241 --> 00:16:42.706
because it creates a permanent source
of pharmaceutical innovation

00:16:42.730 --> 00:16:45.070
that will be here for all future times.

00:16:45.094 --> 00:16:48.652
It's a kind of machine that always
directs pharmaceutical innovation

00:16:48.676 --> 00:16:50.800
to where we have the greatest problems,

00:16:50.824 --> 00:16:53.515
maybe for diseases
that don't even exist yet.

00:16:53.539 --> 00:16:56.651
The Health Impact Fund
will always channel innovation

00:16:56.675 --> 00:16:58.817
in the direction where it's most needed.

00:16:59.471 --> 00:17:01.713
Now, we have a little bit of help already.

00:17:01.737 --> 00:17:05.521
You can see here the number of people
who have agreed to help us,

00:17:05.545 --> 00:17:07.755
but we want your help as well.

00:17:07.779 --> 00:17:12.225
We want you to join us,
maybe to talk with your government

00:17:12.249 --> 00:17:13.925
to help us with publicity,

00:17:13.949 --> 00:17:18.428
to help us with your ideas in perfecting
the Health Impact Fund scheme.

00:17:18.937 --> 00:17:21.641
And what we most urgently need
for the moment

00:17:21.665 --> 00:17:23.715
is to start a pilot.

00:17:24.210 --> 00:17:28.344
The pilot would introduce one medicine
into one jurisdiction

00:17:28.368 --> 00:17:30.915
on the Health Impact Fund model.

00:17:30.939 --> 00:17:36.144
The innovator would get paid according
to the cost of the medicine for the sales,

00:17:36.168 --> 00:17:40.214
and would then get additional money
on the basis of the health impact.

00:17:41.436 --> 00:17:46.898
Here, we need funding for the rewards,
funding for the assessment,

00:17:46.922 --> 00:17:49.515
and in particular, we need
political support

00:17:49.539 --> 00:17:55.525
to get politicians to support
a pilot of that sort.

00:17:56.056 --> 00:18:00.220
If you have any further questions,
don't hesitate to write us

00:18:00.244 --> 00:18:02.047
and contact us at this address.

00:18:02.071 --> 00:18:03.230
Thank you very much.

00:18:03.254 --> 00:18:06.527
(Applause)
