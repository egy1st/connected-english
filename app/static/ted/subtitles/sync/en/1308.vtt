00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:14.150
I'm here to talk about

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:17.150
the wonder and the mystery

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:20.150
of conscious minds.

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:22.150
The wonder is about the fact

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:24.150
that we all woke up this morning

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.150
and we had with it

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:29.150
the amazing return of our conscious mind.

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:32.150
We recovered minds with a complete sense of self

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:35.150
and a complete sense of our own existence,

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:37.150
yet we hardly ever pause to consider this wonder.

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:39.150
We should, in fact,

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:43.150
because without having this possibility of conscious minds,

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:45.150
we would have no knowledge whatsoever

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:47.150
about our humanity;

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:50.150
we would have no knowledge whatsoever about the world.

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:52.150
We would have no pains, but also no joys.

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:55.150
We would have no access to love

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:58.150
or to the ability to create.

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:01.150
And of course, Scott Fitzgerald said famously

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:04.150
that "he who invented consciousness

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:07.150
would have a lot to be blamed for."

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:09.150
But he also forgot

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.150
that without consciousness,

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:14.150
he would have no access to true happiness

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:16.150
and even the possibility of transcendence.

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:19.150
So much for the wonder, now for the mystery.

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:21.150
This is a mystery

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:24.150
that has really been extremely hard to elucidate.

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.150
All the way back into early philosophy

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:30.150
and certainly throughout the history of neuroscience,

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.150
this has been one mystery

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.150
that has always resisted elucidation,

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:37.150
has got major controversies.

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:39.150
And there are actually many people

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.150
that think we should not even touch it;

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:43.150
we should just leave it alone, it's not to be solved.

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:45.150
I don't believe that,

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:47.150
and I think the situation is changing.

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:49.150
It would be ridiculous to claim

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:52.150
that we know how we make consciousness

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:54.150
in our brains,

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:56.150
but we certainly can begin

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:58.150
to approach the question,

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:01.150
and we can begin to see the shape of a solution.

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:04.150
And one more wonder to celebrate

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:08.150
is the fact that we have imaging technologies

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:12.150
that now allow us to go inside the human brain

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:14.150
and be able to do, for example,

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:16.150
what you're seeing right now.

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:19.150
These are images that come from Hanna Damasio's lab,

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:22.150
and which show you, in a living brain,

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:24.150
the reconstruction of that brain.

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:26.150
And this is a person who is alive.

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:28.150
This is not a person

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:31.150
that is being studied at autopsy.

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:33.150
And even more --

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:36.150
and this is something that one can be really amazed about --

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:38.150
is what I'm going to show you next,

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:41.150
which is going underneath the surface of the brain

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:44.150
and actually looking in the living brain

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:47.150
at real connections, real pathways.

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:50.150
So all of those colored lines

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:53.150
correspond to bunches of axons,

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:55.150
the fibers that join cell bodies

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:58.150
to synapses.

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:00.150
And I'm sorry to disappoint you, they don't come in color.

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:03.150
But at any rate, they are there.

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:05.150
The colors are codes for the direction,

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:07.150
from whether it is back to front

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:09.150
or vice versa.

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:12.150
At any rate, what is consciousness?

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:14.150
What is a conscious mind?

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:16.150
And we could take a very simple view

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:20.150
and say, well, it is that which we lose

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:25.150
when we fall into deep sleep without dreams,

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:27.150
or when we go under anesthesia,

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:29.150
and it is what we regain

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:31.150
when we recover from sleep

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:33.150
or from anesthesia.

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:37.150
But what is exactly that stuff that we lose under anesthesia,

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:39.150
or when we are in deep, dreamless sleep?

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:41.150
Well first of all,

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:43.150
it is a mind,

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:45.150
which is a flow of mental images.

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:47.150
And of course consider images

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:49.150
that can be sensory patterns,

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:51.150
visual, such as you're having right now

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:53.150
in relation to the stage and me,

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:55.150
or auditory images,

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:57.150
as you are having now in relation to my words.

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:59.150
That flow of mental images

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:01.150
is mind.

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:03.150
But there is something else

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:05.150
that we are all experiencing in this room.

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:07.150
We are not passive exhibitors

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:10.150
of visual or auditory

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:12.150
or tactile images.

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:14.150
We have selves.

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:16.150
We have a Me

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:18.150
that is automatically present

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:20.150
in our minds right now.

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:22.150
We own our minds.

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:25.150
And we have a sense that it's everyone of us

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:27.150
that is experiencing this --

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:30.150
not the person who is sitting next to you.

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:33.150
So in order to have a conscious mind,

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:37.150
you have a self within the conscious mind.

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:40.150
So a conscious mind is a mind with a self in it.

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:43.150
The self introduces the subjective perspective in the mind,

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:45.150
and we are only fully conscious

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:47.150
when self comes to mind.

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:50.150
So what we need to know to even address this mystery

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:53.150
is, number one, how are minds are put together in the brain,

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:57.150
and, number two, how selves are constructed.

00:04:57.150 --> 00:05:00.150
Now the first part, the first problem,

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:03.150
is relatively easy -- it's not easy at all --

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:07.150
but it is something that has been approached gradually in neuroscience.

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:10.150
And it's quite clear that, in order to make minds,

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:13.150
we need to construct neural maps.

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:16.150
So imagine a grid, like the one I'm showing you right now,

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:18.150
and now imagine, within that grid,

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:20.150
that two-dimensional sheet,

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:22.150
imagine neurons.

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:24.150
And picture, if you will,

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:26.150
a billboard, a digital billboard,

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:28.150
where you have elements

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:30.150
that can be either lit or not.

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:33.150
And depending on how you create the pattern

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:36.150
of lighting or not lighting,

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:38.150
the digital elements,

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:40.150
or, for that matter, the neurons in the sheet,

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:42.150
you're going to be able to construct a map.

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:45.150
This, of course, is a visual map that I'm showing you,

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:47.150
but this applies to any kind of map --

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:50.150
auditory, for example, in relation to sound frequencies,

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:53.150
or to the maps that we construct with our skin

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:56.150
in relation to an object that we palpate.

00:05:56.150 --> 00:05:58.150
Now to bring home the point

00:05:58.150 --> 00:06:00.150
of how close it is --

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:03.150
the relationship between the grid of neurons

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:05.150
and the topographical arrangement

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:07.150
of the activity of the neurons

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:09.150
and our mental experience --

00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:11.150
I'm going to tell you a personal story.

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:14.150
So if I cover my left eye --

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:16.150
I'm talking about me personally, not all of you --

00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:18.150
if I cover my left eye,

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:21.150
I look at the grid -- pretty much like the one I'm showing you.

00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:24.150
Everything is nice and fine and perpendicular.

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:26.150
But sometime ago, I discovered

00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:29.150
that if I cover my left eye,

00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:31.150
instead what I get is this.

00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:34.150
I look at the grid and I see a warping

00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:37.150
at the edge of my central-left field.

00:06:37.150 --> 00:06:39.150
Very odd -- I've analyzed this for a while.

00:06:39.150 --> 00:06:42.150
But sometime ago,

00:06:42.150 --> 00:06:45.150
through the help of an opthamologist colleague of mine,

00:06:45.150 --> 00:06:47.150
Carmen Puliafito,

00:06:47.150 --> 00:06:50.150
who developed a laser scanner of the retina,

00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:52.150
I found out the the following.

00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:54.150
If I scan my retina

00:06:54.150 --> 00:06:57.150
through the horizontal plane that you see there in the little corner,

00:06:57.150 --> 00:06:59.150
what I get is the following.

00:06:59.150 --> 00:07:02.150
On the right side, my retina is perfectly symmetrical.

00:07:02.150 --> 00:07:05.150
You see the going down towards the fovea

00:07:05.150 --> 00:07:07.150
where the optic nerve begins.

00:07:07.150 --> 00:07:09.150
But on my left retina there is a bump,

00:07:09.150 --> 00:07:11.150
which is marked there by the red arrow.

00:07:11.150 --> 00:07:13.150
And it corresponds to a little cyst

00:07:13.150 --> 00:07:15.150
that is located below.

00:07:15.150 --> 00:07:18.150
And that is exactly what causes

00:07:18.150 --> 00:07:21.150
the warping of my visual image.

00:07:21.150 --> 00:07:23.150
So just think of this:

00:07:23.150 --> 00:07:25.150
you have a grid of neurons,

00:07:25.150 --> 00:07:29.150
and now you have a plane mechanical change

00:07:29.150 --> 00:07:31.150
in the position of the grid,

00:07:31.150 --> 00:07:33.150
and you get a warping of your mental experience.

00:07:33.150 --> 00:07:35.150
So this is how close

00:07:35.150 --> 00:07:37.150
your mental experience

00:07:37.150 --> 00:07:40.150
and the activity of the neurons in the retina,

00:07:40.150 --> 00:07:43.150
which is a part of the brain located in the eyeball,

00:07:43.150 --> 00:07:46.150
or, for that matter, a sheet of visual cortex.

00:07:46.150 --> 00:07:48.150
So from the retina

00:07:48.150 --> 00:07:50.150
you go onto visual cortex.

00:07:50.150 --> 00:07:52.150
And of course, the brain adds on

00:07:52.150 --> 00:07:54.150
a lot of information

00:07:54.150 --> 00:07:56.150
to what is going on

00:07:56.150 --> 00:07:58.150
in the signals that come from the retina.

00:07:58.150 --> 00:08:00.150
And in that image there,

00:08:00.150 --> 00:08:02.150
you see a variety of islands

00:08:02.150 --> 00:08:05.150
of what I call image-making regions in the brain.

00:08:05.150 --> 00:08:07.150
You have the green for example,

00:08:07.150 --> 00:08:09.150
that corresponds to tactile information,

00:08:09.150 --> 00:08:12.150
or the blue that corresponds to auditory information.

00:08:12.150 --> 00:08:14.150
And something else that happens

00:08:14.150 --> 00:08:17.150
is that those image-making regions

00:08:17.150 --> 00:08:19.150
where you have the plotting

00:08:19.150 --> 00:08:21.150
of all these neural maps,

00:08:21.150 --> 00:08:23.150
can then provide signals

00:08:23.150 --> 00:08:26.150
to this ocean of purple that you see around,

00:08:26.150 --> 00:08:28.150
which is the association cortex,

00:08:28.150 --> 00:08:31.150
where you can make records of what went on

00:08:31.150 --> 00:08:33.150
in those islands of image-making.

00:08:33.150 --> 00:08:35.150
And the great beauty

00:08:35.150 --> 00:08:38.150
is that you can then go from memory,

00:08:38.150 --> 00:08:40.150
out of those association cortices,

00:08:40.150 --> 00:08:43.150
and produce back images

00:08:43.150 --> 00:08:46.150
in the very same regions that have perception.

00:08:46.150 --> 00:08:49.150
So think about how wonderfully convenient and lazy

00:08:49.150 --> 00:08:51.150
the brain is.

00:08:51.150 --> 00:08:53.150
So it provides certain areas

00:08:53.150 --> 00:08:55.150
for perception and image-making.

00:08:55.150 --> 00:08:57.150
And those are exactly the same

00:08:57.150 --> 00:09:00.150
that are going to be used for image-making

00:09:00.150 --> 00:09:03.150
when we recall information.

00:09:03.150 --> 00:09:06.150
So far the mystery of the conscious mind

00:09:06.150 --> 00:09:08.150
is diminishing a little bit

00:09:08.150 --> 00:09:10.150
because we have a general sense

00:09:10.150 --> 00:09:12.150
of how we make these images.

00:09:12.150 --> 00:09:14.150
But what about the self?

00:09:14.150 --> 00:09:17.150
The self is really the elusive problem.

00:09:17.150 --> 00:09:19.150
And for a long time,

00:09:19.150 --> 00:09:21.150
people did not even want to touch it,

00:09:21.150 --> 00:09:23.150
because they'd say,

00:09:23.150 --> 00:09:26.150
"How can you have this reference point, this stability,

00:09:26.150 --> 00:09:28.150
that is required to maintain

00:09:28.150 --> 00:09:31.150
the continuity of selves day after day?"

00:09:31.150 --> 00:09:34.150
And I thought about a solution to this problem.

00:09:34.150 --> 00:09:36.150
It's the following.

00:09:36.150 --> 00:09:38.150
We generate brain maps

00:09:38.150 --> 00:09:40.150
of the body's interior

00:09:40.150 --> 00:09:43.150
and use them as the reference for all other maps.

00:09:43.150 --> 00:09:46.150
So let me tell you just a little bit about how I came to this.

00:09:46.150 --> 00:09:48.150
I came to this because,

00:09:48.150 --> 00:09:52.150
if you're going to have a reference that we know as self --

00:09:52.150 --> 00:09:54.150
the Me, the I

00:09:54.150 --> 00:09:57.150
in our own processing --

00:09:57.150 --> 00:09:59.150
we need to have something that is stable,

00:09:59.150 --> 00:10:02.150
something that does not deviate much

00:10:02.150 --> 00:10:04.150
from day to day.

00:10:04.150 --> 00:10:06.150
Well it so happens that we have a singular body.

00:10:06.150 --> 00:10:09.150
We have one body, not two, not three.

00:10:09.150 --> 00:10:11.150
And so that is a beginning.

00:10:11.150 --> 00:10:13.150
There is just one reference point, which is the body.

00:10:13.150 --> 00:10:16.150
But then, of course, the body has many parts,

00:10:16.150 --> 00:10:18.150
and things grow at different rates,

00:10:18.150 --> 00:10:20.150
and they have different sizes and different people;

00:10:20.150 --> 00:10:23.150
however, not so with the interior.

00:10:23.150 --> 00:10:25.150
The things that have to do

00:10:25.150 --> 00:10:27.150
with what is known as our internal milieu --

00:10:27.150 --> 00:10:29.150
for example, the whole management

00:10:29.150 --> 00:10:31.150
of the chemistries within our body

00:10:31.150 --> 00:10:33.150
are, in fact, extremely maintained

00:10:33.150 --> 00:10:35.150
day after day

00:10:35.150 --> 00:10:37.150
for one very good reason.

00:10:37.150 --> 00:10:39.150
If you deviate too much

00:10:39.150 --> 00:10:41.150
in the parameters

00:10:41.150 --> 00:10:43.150
that are close to the midline

00:10:43.150 --> 00:10:46.150
of that life-permitting survival range,

00:10:46.150 --> 00:10:48.150
you go into disease or death.

00:10:48.150 --> 00:10:51.150
So we have an in-built system

00:10:51.150 --> 00:10:53.150
within our own lives

00:10:53.150 --> 00:10:56.150
that ensures some kind of continuity.

00:10:56.150 --> 00:10:59.150
I like to call it an almost infinite sameness from day to day.

00:10:59.150 --> 00:11:03.150
Because if you don't have that sameness, physiologically,

00:11:03.150 --> 00:11:05.150
you're going to be sick or you're going to die.

00:11:05.150 --> 00:11:08.150
So that's one more element for this continuity.

00:11:08.150 --> 00:11:10.150
And the final thing

00:11:10.150 --> 00:11:12.150
is that there is a very tight coupling

00:11:12.150 --> 00:11:16.150
between the regulation of our body within the brain

00:11:16.150 --> 00:11:18.150
and the body itself,

00:11:18.150 --> 00:11:21.150
unlike any other coupling.

00:11:21.150 --> 00:11:23.150
So for example, I'm making images of you,

00:11:23.150 --> 00:11:26.150
but there's no physiological bond

00:11:26.150 --> 00:11:29.150
between the images I have of you as an audience

00:11:29.150 --> 00:11:31.150
and my brain.

00:11:31.150 --> 00:11:35.150
However, there is a close, permanently maintained bond

00:11:35.150 --> 00:11:38.150
between the body regulating parts of my brain

00:11:38.150 --> 00:11:40.150
and my own body.

00:11:40.150 --> 00:11:43.150
So here's how it looks. Look at the region there.

00:11:43.150 --> 00:11:46.150
There is the brain stem in between the cerebral cortex

00:11:46.150 --> 00:11:48.150
and the spinal cord.

00:11:48.150 --> 00:11:50.150
And it is within that region

00:11:50.150 --> 00:11:52.150
that I'm going to highlight now

00:11:52.150 --> 00:11:55.150
that we have this housing

00:11:55.150 --> 00:11:58.150
of all the life-regulation devices

00:11:58.150 --> 00:12:00.150
of the body.

00:12:00.150 --> 00:12:03.150
This is so specific that, for example,

00:12:03.150 --> 00:12:06.150
if you look at the part that is covered in red

00:12:06.150 --> 00:12:08.150
in the upper part of the brain stem,

00:12:08.150 --> 00:12:11.150
if you damage that as a result of a stroke, for example,

00:12:11.150 --> 00:12:13.150
what you get is coma

00:12:13.150 --> 00:12:15.150
or vegetative state,

00:12:15.150 --> 00:12:17.150
which is a state, of course,

00:12:17.150 --> 00:12:19.150
in which your mind disappears,

00:12:19.150 --> 00:12:22.150
your consciousness disappears.

00:12:22.150 --> 00:12:24.150
What happens then actually

00:12:24.150 --> 00:12:27.150
is that you lose the grounding of the self,

00:12:27.150 --> 00:12:30.150
you have no longer access to any feeling of your own existence,

00:12:30.150 --> 00:12:33.150
and, in fact, there can be images going on,

00:12:33.150 --> 00:12:35.150
being formed in the cerebral cortex,

00:12:35.150 --> 00:12:37.150
except you don't know they're there.

00:12:37.150 --> 00:12:40.150
You have, in effect, lost consciousness

00:12:40.150 --> 00:12:44.150
when you have damage to that red section of the brain stem.

00:12:44.150 --> 00:12:47.150
But if you consider the green part of the brain stem,

00:12:47.150 --> 00:12:49.150
nothing like that happens.

00:12:49.150 --> 00:12:51.150
It is that specific.

00:12:51.150 --> 00:12:54.150
So in that green component of the brain stem,

00:12:54.150 --> 00:12:57.150
if you damage it, and often it happens,

00:12:57.150 --> 00:12:59.150
what you get is complete paralysis,

00:12:59.150 --> 00:13:02.150
but your conscious mind is maintained.

00:13:02.150 --> 00:13:05.150
You feel, you know, you have a fully conscious mind

00:13:05.150 --> 00:13:08.150
that you can report very indirectly.

00:13:08.150 --> 00:13:11.150
This is a horrific condition. You don't want to see it.

00:13:11.150 --> 00:13:13.150
And people are, in fact, imprisoned

00:13:13.150 --> 00:13:15.150
within their own bodies,

00:13:15.150 --> 00:13:17.150
but they do have a mind.

00:13:17.150 --> 00:13:19.150
There was a very interesting film,

00:13:19.150 --> 00:13:21.150
one of the rare good films done

00:13:21.150 --> 00:13:23.150
about a situation like this,

00:13:23.150 --> 00:13:25.150
by Julian Schnabel some years ago

00:13:25.150 --> 00:13:28.150
about a patient that was in that condition.

00:13:28.150 --> 00:13:30.150
So now I'm going to show you a picture.

00:13:30.150 --> 00:13:32.150
I promise not to say anything about this,

00:13:32.150 --> 00:13:34.150
except this is to frighten you.

00:13:34.150 --> 00:13:36.150
It's just to tell you

00:13:36.150 --> 00:13:39.150
that in that red section of the brain stem,

00:13:39.150 --> 00:13:41.150
there are, to make it simple,

00:13:41.150 --> 00:13:44.150
all those little squares that correspond to modules

00:13:44.150 --> 00:13:47.150
that actually make brain maps

00:13:47.150 --> 00:13:50.150
of different aspects of our interior,

00:13:50.150 --> 00:13:52.150
different aspects of our body.

00:13:52.150 --> 00:13:55.150
They are exquisitely topographic

00:13:55.150 --> 00:13:57.150
and they are exquisitely interconnected

00:13:57.150 --> 00:13:59.150
in a recursive pattern.

00:13:59.150 --> 00:14:02.150
And it is out of this and out of this tight coupling

00:14:02.150 --> 00:14:04.150
between the brain stem and the body

00:14:04.150 --> 00:14:06.150
that I believe -- and I could be wrong,

00:14:06.150 --> 00:14:08.150
but I don't think I am --

00:14:08.150 --> 00:14:11.150
that you generate this mapping of the body

00:14:11.150 --> 00:14:14.150
that provides the grounding for the self

00:14:14.150 --> 00:14:16.150
and that comes in the form of feelings --

00:14:16.150 --> 00:14:18.150
primordial feelings, by the way.

00:14:18.150 --> 00:14:20.150
So what is the picture that we get here?

00:14:20.150 --> 00:14:22.150
Look at "cerebral cortex," look at "brain stem,"

00:14:22.150 --> 00:14:24.150
look at "body,"

00:14:24.150 --> 00:14:27.150
and you get the picture of the interconnectivity

00:14:27.150 --> 00:14:31.150
in which you have the brain stem providing the grounding for the self

00:14:31.150 --> 00:14:34.150
in a very tight interconnection with the body.

00:14:34.150 --> 00:14:36.150
And you have the cerebral cortex

00:14:36.150 --> 00:14:39.150
providing the great spectacle of our minds

00:14:39.150 --> 00:14:41.150
with the profusion of images

00:14:41.150 --> 00:14:44.150
that are, in fact, the contents of our minds

00:14:44.150 --> 00:14:47.150
and that we normally pay most attention to,

00:14:47.150 --> 00:14:49.150
as we should, because that's really

00:14:49.150 --> 00:14:51.150
the film that is rolling in our minds.

00:14:51.150 --> 00:14:53.150
But look at the arrows.

00:14:53.150 --> 00:14:55.150
They're not there for looks.

00:14:55.150 --> 00:14:58.150
They're there because there's this very close interaction.

00:14:58.150 --> 00:15:00.150
You cannot have a conscious mind

00:15:00.150 --> 00:15:02.150
if you don't have the interaction

00:15:02.150 --> 00:15:04.150
between cerebral cortex and brain stem.

00:15:04.150 --> 00:15:06.150
You cannot have a conscious mind

00:15:06.150 --> 00:15:08.150
if you don't have the interaction

00:15:08.150 --> 00:15:10.150
between the brain stem and the body.

00:15:10.150 --> 00:15:12.150
Another thing that is interesting

00:15:12.150 --> 00:15:14.150
is that the brain stem that we have

00:15:14.150 --> 00:15:16.150
is shared with a variety of other species.

00:15:16.150 --> 00:15:18.150
So throughout vertebrates,

00:15:18.150 --> 00:15:21.150
the design of the brain stem is very similar to ours,

00:15:21.150 --> 00:15:23.150
which is one of the reasons why I think

00:15:23.150 --> 00:15:26.150
those other species have conscious minds like we do.

00:15:26.150 --> 00:15:29.150
Except that they're not as rich as ours,

00:15:29.150 --> 00:15:31.150
because they don't have a cerebral cortex like we do.

00:15:31.150 --> 00:15:33.150
That's where the difference is.

00:15:33.150 --> 00:15:36.150
And I strongly disagree with the idea

00:15:36.150 --> 00:15:39.150
that consciousness should be considered

00:15:39.150 --> 00:15:41.150
as the great product of the cerebral cortex.

00:15:41.150 --> 00:15:43.150
Only the wealth of our minds is,

00:15:43.150 --> 00:15:46.150
not the very fact that we have a self

00:15:46.150 --> 00:15:48.150
that we can refer

00:15:48.150 --> 00:15:50.150
to our own existence,

00:15:50.150 --> 00:15:54.150
and that we have any sense of person.

00:15:54.150 --> 00:15:57.150
Now there are three levels of self to consider --

00:15:57.150 --> 00:16:00.150
the proto, the core and the autobiographical.

00:16:00.150 --> 00:16:02.150
The first two are shared

00:16:02.150 --> 00:16:04.150
with many, many other species,

00:16:04.150 --> 00:16:06.150
and they are really coming out

00:16:06.150 --> 00:16:08.150
largely of the brain stem

00:16:08.150 --> 00:16:11.150
and whatever there is of cortex in those species.

00:16:11.150 --> 00:16:13.150
It's the autobiographical self

00:16:13.150 --> 00:16:15.150
which some species have, I think.

00:16:15.150 --> 00:16:18.150
Cetaceans and primates have also

00:16:18.150 --> 00:16:20.150
an autobiographical self to a certain degree.

00:16:20.150 --> 00:16:22.150
And everybody's dogs at home

00:16:22.150 --> 00:16:25.150
have an autobiographical self to a certain degree.

00:16:25.150 --> 00:16:27.150
But the novelty is here.

00:16:27.150 --> 00:16:29.150
The autobiographical self is built

00:16:29.150 --> 00:16:31.150
on the basis of past memories

00:16:31.150 --> 00:16:34.150
and memories of the plans that we have made;

00:16:34.150 --> 00:16:37.150
it's the lived past and the anticipated future.

00:16:37.150 --> 00:16:39.150
And the autobiographical self

00:16:39.150 --> 00:16:42.150
has prompted extended memory, reasoning,

00:16:42.150 --> 00:16:44.150
imagination, creativity and language.

00:16:44.150 --> 00:16:47.150
And out of that came the instruments of culture --

00:16:47.150 --> 00:16:49.150
religions, justice,

00:16:49.150 --> 00:16:51.150
trade, the arts, science, technology.

00:16:51.150 --> 00:16:53.150
And it is within that culture

00:16:53.150 --> 00:16:55.150
that we really can get --

00:16:55.150 --> 00:16:57.150
and this is the novelty --

00:16:57.150 --> 00:17:01.150
something that is not entirely set by our biology.

00:17:01.150 --> 00:17:03.150
It is developed in the cultures.

00:17:03.150 --> 00:17:07.150
It developed in collectives of human beings.

00:17:07.150 --> 00:17:09.150
And this is, of course, the culture

00:17:09.150 --> 00:17:12.150
where we have developed something that I like to call

00:17:12.150 --> 00:17:14.150
socio-cultural regulation.

00:17:14.150 --> 00:17:16.150
And finally, you could rightly ask,

00:17:16.150 --> 00:17:18.150
why care about this?

00:17:18.150 --> 00:17:21.150
Why care if it is the brain stem or the cerebral cortex

00:17:21.150 --> 00:17:23.150
and how this is made?

00:17:23.150 --> 00:17:25.150
Three reasons. First, curiosity.

00:17:25.150 --> 00:17:27.150
Primates are extremely curious --

00:17:27.150 --> 00:17:29.150
and humans most of all.

00:17:29.150 --> 00:17:32.150
And if we are interested, for example,

00:17:32.150 --> 00:17:34.150
in the fact that anti-gravity

00:17:34.150 --> 00:17:36.150
is pulling galaxies away from the Earth,

00:17:36.150 --> 00:17:38.150
why should we not be interested in what is going on

00:17:38.150 --> 00:17:41.150
inside of human beings?

00:17:41.150 --> 00:17:43.150
Second, understanding society and culture.

00:17:43.150 --> 00:17:45.150
We should look

00:17:45.150 --> 00:17:47.150
at how society and culture

00:17:47.150 --> 00:17:49.150
in this socio-cultural regulation

00:17:49.150 --> 00:17:51.150
are a work in progress.

00:17:51.150 --> 00:17:53.150
And finally, medicine.

00:17:53.150 --> 00:17:55.150
Let's not forget that some of the worst diseases

00:17:55.150 --> 00:17:57.150
of humankind

00:17:57.150 --> 00:17:59.150
are diseases such as depression,

00:17:59.150 --> 00:18:02.150
Alzheimer's disease, drug addiction.

00:18:02.150 --> 00:18:05.150
Think of strokes that can devastate your mind

00:18:05.150 --> 00:18:07.150
or render you unconscious.

00:18:07.150 --> 00:18:10.150
You have no prayer

00:18:10.150 --> 00:18:13.150
of treating those diseases effectively

00:18:13.150 --> 00:18:15.150
and in a non-serendipitous way

00:18:15.150 --> 00:18:17.150
if you do not know how this works.

00:18:17.150 --> 00:18:19.150
So that's a very good reason

00:18:19.150 --> 00:18:21.150
beyond curiosity

00:18:21.150 --> 00:18:23.150
to justify what we're doing,

00:18:23.150 --> 00:18:26.150
and to justify having some interest in what is going on in our brains.

00:18:26.150 --> 00:18:28.150
Thank you for your attention.

00:18:28.150 --> 00:18:33.150
