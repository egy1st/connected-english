00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:14.150
I've spent the last decade

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:17.150
subjecting myself to pain and humiliation,

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:19.150
hopefully for a good cause,

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:22.150
which is self-improvement.

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:24.150
And I've done this in three parts.

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.150
So first I started with the mind.

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:31.150
And I decided to try to get smarter

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:33.150
by reading the entire Encyclopedia Britannica

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:35.150
from A to Z --

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:38.150
or, more precisely, from "a-ak" to "Zywiec."

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:40.150
And here's a little image of that.

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:42.150
And this was an amazing year.

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:44.150
It was really a fascinating journey.

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:47.150
It was painful at times,

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:49.150
especially for those around me.

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:52.150
My wife started to fine me one dollar

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:55.150
for every irrelevant fact I inserted into conversation.

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:59.150
So it had its downsides.

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:01.150
But after that,

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:03.150
I decided to work on the spirit.

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:05.150
As I mentioned last year,

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:07.150
I grew up with no religion at all.

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:09.150
I'm Jewish,

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.150
but I'm Jewish in the same way the Olive Garden is Italian.

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.150
(Laughter)

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:16.150
Not really.

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:19.150
But I decided to learn about the Bible and my heritage

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:21.150
by actually diving in

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.150
and trying to live it and immerse myself in it.

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:26.150
So I decided to follow all the rules of the Bible.

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:28.150
And from the Ten Commandments

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:30.150
to growing my beard --

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.150
because Leviticus says you cannot shave.

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:35.150
So this is what I looked like by the end.

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:37.150
Thank you for that reaction.

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:40.150
(Laughter)

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:43.150
I look a little like Moses, or Ted Kaczynski.

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:45.150
I got both of them.

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:48.150
So there was the topiary there.

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:51.150
And there's the sheep.

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:53.150
Now the final part of the trilogy

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:56.150
was I wanted to focus on the body

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:58.150
and try to be the healthiest person I could be,

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:00.150
the healthiest person alive.

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:03.150
So that's what I've been doing the last couple of years.

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:05.150
And I just finished a couple of months ago.

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:07.150
And I have to say, thank God.

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:10.150
Because living so healthily was killing me.

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:12.150
(Laughter)

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:15.150
It was so overwhelming,

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:17.150
because the amount of things you have to do,

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:19.150
it's just mind-boggling.

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:21.150
I was listening to all the experts

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:23.150
and talking to sort of a board of medical advisers.

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:25.150
And they were telling me

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:27.150
all the things I had to do.

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:29.150
I had to eat right,

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:32.150
exercise, meditate, pet dogs,

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:34.150
because that lowers the blood pressure.

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:36.150
I wrote the book on a treadmill,

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:38.150
and it took me about a thousand miles

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:40.150
to write the book.

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:42.150
I had to put on sunscreen.

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:44.150
This was no small feat,

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:46.150
because if you listen to dermatologists,

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:49.150
they say that you should have a shot glass full of sunscreen.

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:51.150
And you have to reapply it every two to four hours.

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:53.150
So I think half of my book advance

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:55.150
went into sunscreen.

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:57.150
I was like a glazed doughnut

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:59.150
for most of the year.

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:01.150
There was the washing of hands.

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:03.150
I had to do that properly.

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:05.150
And my immunologist told me

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:08.150
that I should also wipe down

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:11.150
all of the remote controls and iPhones in my house,

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:14.150
because those are just orgies of germs.

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:16.150
So that took a lot of time.

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:19.150
I also tried to be the safest person I could be,

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:21.150
because that's a part of health.

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:23.150
I was inspired

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:25.150
by the Danish Safety Council.

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:27.150
They started a public campaign

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:30.150
that says, "A walking helmet is a good helmet."

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:34.150
So they believe you should not just wear helmets for biking,

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:37.150
but also for walking around.

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:40.150
And you can see there

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:42.150
they're shopping with their helmets.

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:44.150
(Laughter)

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:47.150
Well yeah, I tried that.

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:50.150
Now it's a little extreme, I admit.

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:52.150
But if you think about this,

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:55.150
this is actually -- the "Freakonomics" authors wrote about this --

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:58.150
that more people die on a per mile basis

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:00.150
from drunk walking

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:02.150
than from drunk driving.

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:04.150
So something to think about tonight

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:07.150
if you've had a couple.

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:09.150
So I finished,

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:11.150
and it was a success in a sense.

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:14.150
All of the markers went in the right direction.

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:17.150
My cholesterol went down, I lost weight,

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:21.150
my wife stopped telling me that I looked pregnant.

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:24.150
So that was nice.

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:27.150
And it was successful overall.

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:29.150
But I also learned that I was too healthy,

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:31.150
and that was unhealthy.

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:34.150
I was so focused on doing all these things

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:37.150
that I was neglecting my friends and family.

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:39.150
And as Dan Buettner can tell you,

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:41.150
having a strong social network

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:43.150
is so crucial to our health.

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:45.150
So I finished.

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:48.150
And I kind of went overboard

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:51.150
on the week after the project was over.

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:53.150
I went to the dark side,

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:55.150
and I just indulged myself.

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:57.150
It was like something out of Caligula.

00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:59.150
(Laughter)

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:01.150
Without the sex part.

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:03.150
Because I have three young kids,

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:06.150
so that wasn't happening.

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:09.150
But the over-eating and over-drinking, definitely.

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:14.150
And I finally have stabilized.

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:16.150
So now I'm back

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:19.150
to adopting many -- not all; I don't wear a helmet anymore --

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:22.150
but dozens of healthy behaviors

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:25.150
that I adopted during my year.

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:28.150
It was really a life-changing project.

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:31.150
And I, of course, don't have time to go into all of them.

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:34.150
Let me just tell you two really quickly.

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:36.150
The first is -- and this was surprising to me;

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:38.150
I didn't expect this to come out --

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:41.150
but I live a much quieter life now.

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:44.150
Because we live in such a noisy world.

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:48.150
There's trains and planes and cars

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:51.150
and Bill O'Reilly, he's very noisy.

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:54.150
(Laughter)

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:59.150
And this is a real underestimated, under-appreciated health hazard --

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:02.150
not just because it harms our hearing, which it obviously does,

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:05.150
but it actually initiates

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:07.150
the fight-or-flight response.

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:10.150
A loud noise will get your fight-or-flight response going.

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:13.150
And this, over the years,

00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:16.150
can cause real damage, cardiovascular damage.

00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:19.150
The World Health Organization just did a big study

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:21.150
that they published this year.

00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:23.150
And it was done in Europe.

00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:25.150
And they estimated

00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:29.150
that 1.6 million years of healthy living

00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:32.150
are lost every year in Europe

00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:35.150
because of noise pollution.

00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:38.150
So they think it's actually very deadly.

00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:40.150
And by the way,

00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:43.150
it's also terrible for your brain.

00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:46.150
It really impairs cognition.

00:06:46.150 --> 00:06:48.150
And our Founding Fathers knew about this.

00:06:48.150 --> 00:06:50.150
When they wrote the Constitution,

00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:54.150
they put dirt all over the cobblestones outside the hall

00:06:54.150 --> 00:06:57.150
so that they could concentrate.

00:06:57.150 --> 00:07:00.150
So without noise reduction technology,

00:07:00.150 --> 00:07:03.150
our country would not exist.

00:07:03.150 --> 00:07:05.150
So as a patriot,

00:07:05.150 --> 00:07:07.150
I felt it was important to --

00:07:07.150 --> 00:07:09.150
I wear all the earplugs and the earphones,

00:07:09.150 --> 00:07:12.150
and it's really improved my life

00:07:12.150 --> 00:07:15.150
in a surprising and unexpected way.

00:07:15.150 --> 00:07:18.150
And the second point I want to make, the final point,

00:07:18.150 --> 00:07:23.150
is that -- and it's actually been a theme of TEDMED --

00:07:23.150 --> 00:07:27.150
that joy is so important to your health,

00:07:27.150 --> 00:07:31.150
that very few of these behaviors

00:07:31.150 --> 00:07:33.150
will stick with me

00:07:33.150 --> 00:07:38.150
unless there's some sense of pleasure and joy in them.

00:07:38.150 --> 00:07:41.150
And just to give you one instance of this:

00:07:41.150 --> 00:07:43.150
food.

00:07:43.150 --> 00:07:46.150
The junk food industry

00:07:46.150 --> 00:07:48.150
is really great

00:07:48.150 --> 00:07:50.150
at pressing our pleasure buttons

00:07:50.150 --> 00:07:53.150
and figuring out what's the most pleasurable.

00:07:53.150 --> 00:07:55.150
But I think we can use their techniques

00:07:55.150 --> 00:07:57.150
and apply them to healthy food.

00:07:57.150 --> 00:07:59.150
To give just one example,

00:07:59.150 --> 00:08:02.150
we love crunchiness, mouthfeel.

00:08:02.150 --> 00:08:06.150
So I basically have tried to incorporate crunchiness

00:08:06.150 --> 00:08:08.150
into a lot of my recipes --

00:08:08.150 --> 00:08:10.150
throw in some sunflower seeds.

00:08:10.150 --> 00:08:12.150
And you can almost trick yourself

00:08:12.150 --> 00:08:14.150
into thinking you're eating Doritos.

00:08:14.150 --> 00:08:16.150
(Laughter)

00:08:16.150 --> 00:08:18.150
And it has made me a healthier person.

00:08:18.150 --> 00:08:20.150
So that is it.

00:08:20.150 --> 00:08:22.150
The book about it comes out in April.

00:08:22.150 --> 00:08:24.150
It's called "Drop Dead Healthy."

00:08:24.150 --> 00:08:26.150
And I hope that I don't get sick during the book tour.

00:08:26.150 --> 00:08:28.150
That's my greatest hope.

00:08:28.150 --> 00:08:30.150
So thank you very much.

00:08:30.150 --> 00:08:33.150
(Applause)
