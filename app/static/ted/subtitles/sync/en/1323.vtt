00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:30.150
♫ They stood together ♫

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:33.150
♫ under a tree in tall grass ♫

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:36.150

♫ We will be left to wander ♫

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:50.150
♫ and fade away ♫

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:53.150
♫ Soldiers came and took our husbands ♫

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:56.150
♫ at the break of day ♫

00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:00.150
♫ We will live on ♫

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:04.150
♫ then fade away ♫

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:07.150
♫ Soldiers came and killed our children ♫

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:10.150
