00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:14.951
So what makes a piece of music beautiful?

00:00:15.548 --> 00:00:17.869
Well, most musicologists would argue

00:00:17.893 --> 00:00:20.462
that repetition is a key aspect of beauty,

00:00:20.486 --> 00:00:23.495
the idea that we take a melody,
a motif, a musical idea,

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:26.782
we repeat it, we set up
the expectation for repetition,

00:00:26.806 --> 00:00:29.653
and then we either realize it
or we break the repetition.

00:00:29.677 --> 00:00:31.764
And that's a key component of beauty.

00:00:31.788 --> 00:00:35.292
So if repetition and patterns
are key to beauty,

00:00:35.316 --> 00:00:37.728
then what would the absence
of patterns sound like,

00:00:37.752 --> 00:00:42.149
if we wrote a piece of music
that had no repetition whatsoever in it?

00:00:43.098 --> 00:00:45.598
That's actually an interesting
mathematical question.

00:00:45.622 --> 00:00:49.195
Is it possible to write a piece of music
that has no repetition whatsoever?

00:00:49.219 --> 00:00:50.933
It's not random -- random is easy.

00:00:50.957 --> 00:00:53.604
Repetition-free, it turns
out, is extremely difficult,

00:00:53.628 --> 00:00:55.820
and the only reason
that we can actually do it

00:00:55.844 --> 00:00:59.288
is because of a man
who was hunting for submarines.

00:00:59.312 --> 00:01:03.522
It turns out, a guy who was trying
to develop the world's perfect sonar ping

00:01:03.546 --> 00:01:06.512
solved the problem of writing
pattern-free music.

00:01:06.536 --> 00:01:08.735
And that's what the topic
of the talk is today.

00:01:12.763 --> 00:01:15.015
So, recall that in sonar,

00:01:15.039 --> 00:01:17.916
you have a ship that sends
out some sound in the water,

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:19.763
and it listens for it -- an echo.

00:01:19.787 --> 00:01:22.796
The sound goes down, it echoes
back, it goes down, echoes back.

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:26.189
The time it takes the sound to come back
tells you how far away it is:

00:01:26.213 --> 00:01:27.655
if it comes at a higher pitch,

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:29.757
it's because the thing
is moving toward you;

00:01:29.781 --> 00:01:32.719
if it comes back at a lower pitch,
it's moving away from you.

00:01:32.743 --> 00:01:34.864
So how would you design
a perfect sonar ping?

00:01:34.888 --> 00:01:38.369
Well, in the 1960s, a guy
by the name of John Costas

00:01:38.393 --> 00:01:42.229
was working on the Navy's extremely
expensive sonar system.

00:01:42.253 --> 00:01:45.915
It wasn't working, because the ping
they were using was inappropriate.

00:01:45.939 --> 00:01:48.245
It was a ping much
like the following here.

00:01:48.269 --> 00:01:52.338
You can think of this as the notes
and this is time.

00:01:52.794 --> 00:01:54.524
(Piano notes play high to low)

00:01:54.548 --> 00:01:57.762
So that was the sonar ping
they were using, a down chirp.

00:01:57.786 --> 00:01:59.631
It turns out that's a really bad ping.

00:01:59.655 --> 00:02:02.597
Why? Because it looks
like shifts of itself.

00:02:02.621 --> 00:02:06.484
The relationship between the first
two notes is the same as the second two,

00:02:06.508 --> 00:02:07.673
and so forth.

00:02:07.697 --> 00:02:10.181
So he designed a different
kind of sonar ping,

00:02:10.205 --> 00:02:11.663
one that looks random.

00:02:11.687 --> 00:02:14.638
These look like a random pattern
of dots, but they're not.

00:02:14.662 --> 00:02:15.964
If you look very carefully,

00:02:15.988 --> 00:02:19.783
you may notice that, in fact,
the relationship between each pair of dots

00:02:19.807 --> 00:02:20.975
is distinct.

00:02:20.999 --> 00:02:22.499
Nothing is ever repeated.

00:02:22.523 --> 00:02:25.220
The first two notes
and every other pair of notes

00:02:25.244 --> 00:02:26.871
have a different relationship.

00:02:28.175 --> 00:02:31.446
So the fact that we know
about these patterns is unusual.

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:33.661
John Costas is the inventor
of these patterns.

00:02:33.685 --> 00:02:36.257
This is a picture from 2006,
shortly before his death.

00:02:36.281 --> 00:02:39.190
He was the sonar engineer
working for the Navy.

00:02:39.214 --> 00:02:41.606
He was thinking about these patterns,

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:44.489
and he was, by hand, able to come
up with them to size 12 --

00:02:44.513 --> 00:02:45.805
12 by 12.

00:02:45.829 --> 00:02:48.750
He couldn't go any further
and thought maybe they don't exist

00:02:48.774 --> 00:02:50.088
in any size bigger than 12.

00:02:50.112 --> 00:02:52.735
So he wrote a letter
to the mathematician in the middle,

00:02:52.759 --> 00:02:55.830
a young mathematician in California
at the time, Solomon Golomb.

00:02:55.854 --> 00:02:57.409
It turns out that Solomon Golomb

00:02:57.433 --> 00:03:01.356
was one of the most gifted discrete
mathematicians of our time.

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:04.457
John asked Solomon if he could tell him
the right reference

00:03:04.481 --> 00:03:06.006
to where these patterns were.

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:07.191
There was no reference.

00:03:07.215 --> 00:03:09.591
Nobody had ever thought
about a repetition,

00:03:09.615 --> 00:03:11.436
a pattern-free structure before.

00:03:12.023 --> 00:03:15.143
So, Solomon Golomb spent the summer
thinking about the problem.

00:03:15.167 --> 00:03:18.297
And he relied on the mathematics
of this gentleman here,

00:03:18.321 --> 00:03:19.495
Évariste Galois.

00:03:19.519 --> 00:03:21.578
Now, Galois is a very
famous mathematician.

00:03:21.602 --> 00:03:24.735
He's famous because he invented
a whole branch of mathematics

00:03:24.759 --> 00:03:27.306
which bears his name,
called Galois field theory.

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:30.618
It's the mathematics of prime numbers.

00:03:31.051 --> 00:03:33.775
He's also famous
because of the way that he died.

00:03:34.406 --> 00:03:37.431
The story is that he stood up
for the honor of a young woman.

00:03:37.455 --> 00:03:40.243
He was challenged to a duel,
and he accepted.

00:03:41.133 --> 00:03:43.211
And shortly before the duel occurred,

00:03:43.235 --> 00:03:45.293
he wrote down all
of his mathematical ideas,

00:03:45.317 --> 00:03:48.248
sent letters to all of his friends,
saying "Please, please" --

00:03:48.272 --> 00:03:49.477
this was 200 years ago --

00:03:49.501 --> 00:03:52.699
"Please, please, see that these things
get published eventually."

00:03:52.723 --> 00:03:55.864
He then fought the duel,
was shot and died at age 20.

00:03:56.467 --> 00:03:59.149
The mathematics that runs
your cell phones, the internet,

00:03:59.173 --> 00:04:02.615
that allows us to communicate, DVDs,

00:04:02.639 --> 00:04:05.467
all comes from the mind
of Évariste Galois,

00:04:05.491 --> 00:04:08.218
a mathematician who died 20 years young.

00:04:08.242 --> 00:04:10.605
When you talk about
the legacy that you leave ...

00:04:10.629 --> 00:04:12.701
Of course, he couldn't have
even anticipated

00:04:12.725 --> 00:04:14.806
the way that his mathematics
would be used.

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:17.355
Thankfully, his mathematics
was eventually published.

00:04:17.379 --> 00:04:20.980
Solomon Golomb realized that that was
exactly the mathematics needed

00:04:21.004 --> 00:04:24.392
to solve the problem of creating
a pattern-free structure.

00:04:24.416 --> 00:04:27.135
So he sent a letter back to John saying,

00:04:27.159 --> 00:04:30.663
"It turns out you can generate
these patterns using prime number theory."

00:04:30.687 --> 00:04:35.918
And John went about and solved
the sonar problem for the Navy.

00:04:36.885 --> 00:04:38.897
So what do these patterns look like again?

00:04:38.921 --> 00:04:40.103
Here's a pattern here.

00:04:40.127 --> 00:04:44.465
This is an 88-by-88-sized Costas array.

00:04:44.952 --> 00:04:47.131
It's generated in a very simple way.

00:04:47.155 --> 00:04:51.358
Elementary school mathematics
is sufficient to solve this problem.

00:04:51.382 --> 00:04:55.005
It's generated by repeatedly
multiplying by the number three:

00:04:55.029 --> 00:05:00.026
1, 3, 9, 27, 81, 243 ...

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:03.530
When I get to a number that's larger
than 89 which happens to be prime,

00:05:03.554 --> 00:05:06.407
I keep taking 89s away
until I get back below.

00:05:06.431 --> 00:05:10.273
And this will eventually fill
the entire grid, 88 by 88.

00:05:10.297 --> 00:05:13.430
There happen to be 88 notes on the piano.

00:05:13.454 --> 00:05:16.123
So today, we are going to have
the world premiere

00:05:16.147 --> 00:05:20.238
of the world's first
pattern-free piano sonata.

00:05:21.996 --> 00:05:24.138
So, back to the question of music:

00:05:24.162 --> 00:05:25.630
What makes music beautiful?

00:05:25.654 --> 00:05:28.686
Let's think about one of the most
beautiful pieces ever written,

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:33.333
Beethoven's Fifth Symphony
and the famous "da na na na!" motif.

00:05:33.357 --> 00:05:36.824
That motif occurs hundreds
of times in the symphony --

00:05:36.848 --> 00:05:38.996
hundreds of times
in the first movement alone

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:41.117
and also in all the other
movements as well.

00:05:41.141 --> 00:05:45.372
So the setting up of this repetition
is so important for beauty.

00:05:45.396 --> 00:05:49.189
If we think about random music
as being just random notes here,

00:05:49.213 --> 00:05:52.388
and over here, somehow, Beethoven's Fifth
in some kind of pattern,

00:05:52.412 --> 00:05:54.523
if we wrote completely pattern-free music,

00:05:54.547 --> 00:05:56.173
it would be way out on the tail.

00:05:56.197 --> 00:05:59.951
In fact, the end of the tail of music
would be these pattern-free structures.

00:05:59.975 --> 00:06:03.796
This music that we saw before,
those stars on the grid,

00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:07.168
is far, far, far from random.

00:06:07.192 --> 00:06:09.012
It's perfectly pattern-free.

00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:12.596
It turns out that musicologists --

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:15.345
a famous composer by the name
of Arnold Schoenberg --

00:06:15.369 --> 00:06:18.693
thought of this in the 1930s,
'40s and '50s.

00:06:18.717 --> 00:06:21.849
His goal as a composer was to write music

00:06:21.873 --> 00:06:24.430
that would free music
from tonal structure.

00:06:24.454 --> 00:06:26.809
He called it the "emancipation
of the dissonance."

00:06:26.833 --> 00:06:29.032
He created these structures
called "tone rows."

00:06:29.056 --> 00:06:30.290
This is a tone row there.

00:06:30.314 --> 00:06:32.214
It sounds a lot like a Costas array.

00:06:32.238 --> 00:06:35.870
Unfortunately, he died 10 years
before Costas solved the problem

00:06:35.894 --> 00:06:38.454
of how you can mathematically
create these structures.

00:06:39.470 --> 00:06:44.252
Today, we're going to hear the world
premiere of the perfect ping.

00:06:44.276 --> 00:06:48.253
This is an 88-by-88-sized Costas array,

00:06:48.277 --> 00:06:49.872
mapped to notes on the piano,

00:06:49.896 --> 00:06:53.369
played using a structure called
a Golomb ruler for the rhythm,

00:06:53.393 --> 00:06:55.918
which means the starting
time of each pair of notes

00:06:55.942 --> 00:06:57.515
is distinct as well.

00:06:57.539 --> 00:07:00.248
This is mathematically almost impossible.

00:07:00.272 --> 00:07:03.083
Actually, computationally,
it would be impossible to create.

00:07:03.107 --> 00:07:06.538
Because of the mathematics
that was developed 200 years ago,

00:07:06.562 --> 00:07:09.224
through another mathematician
recently and an engineer,

00:07:09.248 --> 00:07:12.158
we were able to actually compose
this, or construct this,

00:07:12.182 --> 00:07:14.780
using multiplication by the number three.

00:07:14.804 --> 00:07:17.204
The point when you hear this music

00:07:17.228 --> 00:07:19.686
is not that it's supposed to be beautiful.

00:07:19.710 --> 00:07:23.642
This is supposed to be
the world's ugliest piece of music.

00:07:24.251 --> 00:07:27.456
In fact, it's music
that only a mathematician could write.

00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:28.503
(Laughter)

00:07:28.527 --> 00:07:31.350
When you're listening to this
piece of music, I implore you:

00:07:31.374 --> 00:07:33.057
try and find some repetition.

00:07:33.081 --> 00:07:35.547
Try and find something that you enjoy,

00:07:35.571 --> 00:07:38.557
and then revel in the fact
that you won't find it.

00:07:38.581 --> 00:07:39.923
(Laughter)

00:07:39.947 --> 00:07:42.558
So without further ado, Michael Linville,

00:07:42.582 --> 00:07:45.394
the [Dean] of Chamber Music
at the New World Symphony,

00:07:45.418 --> 00:07:48.775
will perform the world premiere
of the perfect ping.

00:07:49.836 --> 00:07:55.108
(Music)

00:09:31.462 --> 00:09:33.462
(Music ends)

00:09:36.837 --> 00:09:38.695
(Scott Rickard, off-screen) Thank you.

00:09:38.719 --> 00:09:43.619
(Applause)
