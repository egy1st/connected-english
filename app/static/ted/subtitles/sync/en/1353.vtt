00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.150
I'm here to share my photography.

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:19.150
Or is it photography?

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:21.150
Because, of course, this is a photograph

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.150
that you can't take with your camera.

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:25.150
Yet, my interest in photography started

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:27.150
as I got my first digital camera

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.150
at the age of 15.

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.150
It mixed with my earlier passion for drawing,

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:34.150
but it was a bit different,

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:36.150
because using the camera,

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:39.150
the process was in the planning instead.

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:42.150
And when you take a photograph with a camera,

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:46.150
the process ends when you press the trigger.

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:48.150
So to me it felt like photography was more about

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:51.150
being at the right place and the right time.

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:54.150
I felt like anyone could do that.

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:57.150
So I wanted to create something different,

00:00:57.150 --> 00:00:59.150
something where the process starts

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:02.150
when you press the trigger.

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:04.150
Photos like this:

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:06.150
construction going on along a busy road.

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.150
But it has an unexpected twist.

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.150
And despite that,

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:14.150
it retains a level of realism.

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:17.150
Or photos like these --

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:20.150
both dark and colorful,

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:22.150
but all with a common goal

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:24.150
of retaining the level of realism.

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.150
When I say realism,

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:28.150
I mean photo-realism.

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:30.150
Because, of course,

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.150
it's not something you can capture really,

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:36.150
but I always want it to look like it could have been captured somehow

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.150
as a photograph.

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:41.150
Photos where you will need a brief moment to think

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:43.150
to figure out the trick.

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:45.150
So it's more about capturing an idea

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:48.150
than about capturing a moment really.

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:50.150
But what's the trick

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:52.150
that makes it look realistic?

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:54.150
Is it something about the details

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:56.150
or the colors?

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:59.150
Is it something about the light?

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:02.150
What creates the illusion?

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:06.150
Sometimes the perspective is the illusion.

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:09.150
But in the end, it comes down to how we interpret the world

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:12.150
and how it can be realized on a two-dimensional surface.

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:14.150
It's not really what is realistic,

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:18.150
it's what we think looks realistic really.

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:20.150
So I think the basics

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:22.150
are quite simple.

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:25.150
I just see it as a puzzle of reality

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:28.150
where you can take different pieces of reality and put it together

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:31.150
to create alternate reality.

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:34.150
And let me show you a simple example.

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:38.150
Here we have three perfectly imaginable physical objects,

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:41.150
something we all can relate to living in a three-dimensional world.

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:44.150
But combined in a certain way,

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:48.150
they can create something that still looks three-dimensional,

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:50.150
like it could exist.

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:53.150
But at the same time, we know it can't.

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:55.150
So we trick our brains,

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:57.150
because our brain simply doesn't accept the fact

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:59.150
that it doesn't really make sense.

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:02.150
And I see the same process

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:05.150
with combining photographs.

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:08.150
It's just really about combining different realities.

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:13.150
So the things that make a photograph look realistic,

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:16.150
I think it's the things that we don't even think about,

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:20.150
the things all around us in our daily lives.

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:22.150
But when combining photographs,

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:24.150
this is really important to consider,

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:28.150
because otherwise it just looks wrong somehow.

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:31.150
So I would like to say that there are three simple rules to follow

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:34.150
to achieve a realistic result.

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:37.150
As you can see, these images aren't really special.

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:41.150
But combined, they can create something like this.

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:46.150
So the first rule is that photos combined

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:48.150
should have the same perspective.

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:50.150
Secondly, photos combined

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:53.150
should have the same type of light.

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:56.150
And these two images both fulfill these two requirements --

00:03:56.150 --> 00:04:00.150
shot at the same height and in the same type of light.

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:03.150
The third one is about making it impossible to distinguish

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:06.150
where the different images begin and end

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:09.150
by making it seamless.

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:11.150
Make it impossible to say

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:13.150
how the image actually was composed.

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:17.150
So by matching color, contrast and brightness

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:19.150
in the borders between the different images,

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:21.150
adding photographic defects

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:23.150
like depth of field,

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:26.150
desaturated colors and noise,

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:28.150
we erase the borders between the different images

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:31.150
and make it look like one single image,

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:33.150
despite the fact that one image

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:36.150
can contain hundreds of layers basically.

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:40.150
So here's another example.

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:42.150
(Laughter)

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:45.150
One might think that this is just an image of a landscape

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:48.150
and the lower part is what's manipulated.

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:51.150
But this image is actually entirely composed

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:54.150
of photographs from different locations.

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:57.150
I personally think that it's easier to actually create a place

00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:59.150
than to find a place,

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:01.150
because then you don't need to compromise

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:03.150
with the ideas in your head.

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:06.150
But it does require a lot of planning.

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:08.150
And getting this idea during winter,

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:10.150
I knew that I had several months to plan it,

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:12.150
to find the different locations

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:15.150
for the pieces of the puzzle basically.

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:17.150
So for example,

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:20.150
the fish was captured on a fishing trip.

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:22.150
The shores are from a different location.

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:25.150
The underwater part was captured in a stone pit.

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:28.150
And yeah, I even turned the house on top of the island red

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:31.150
to make it look more Swedish.

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:33.150
So to achieve a realistic result,

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:36.150
I think it comes down to planning.

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:40.150
It always starts with a sketch, an idea.

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:43.150
Then it's about combining the different photographs.

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:46.150
And here every piece is very well planned.

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:49.150
And if you do a good job capturing the photos,

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:51.150
the result can be quite beautiful

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:54.150
and also quite realistic.

00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:59.150
So all the tools are out there,

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:02.150
and the only thing that limits us

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:06.150
is our imagination.

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:08.150
Thank you.

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:12.150
(Applause)
