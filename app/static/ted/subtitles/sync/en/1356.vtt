00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.150
Penelope Jagessar Chaffer: I was going to ask if there's a doctor in the house.

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:17.150
No, I'm just joking.

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:20.150
It's interesting, because it was six years ago

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:22.150
when I was pregnant with my first child

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:24.150
that I discovered

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.150
that the most commonly used preservative

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:28.150
in baby care products

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:30.150
mimics estrogen

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.150
when it gets into the human body.

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:34.150
Now it's very easy actually

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:36.150
to get a chemical compound from products

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:38.150
into the human body through the skin.

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:40.150
And these preservatives had been found

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:42.150
in breast cancer tumors.

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:44.150
That was the start of my journey

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:46.150
to make this film, "Toxic Baby."

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:48.150
And it doesn't take much time

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:50.150
to discover some really astonishing statistics

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:52.150
with this issue.

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:55.150
One is that you and I all have

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:57.150
between 30 to 50,000 chemicals

00:00:57.150 --> 00:00:59.150
in our bodies

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:01.150
that our grandparents didn't have.

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:03.150
And many of these chemicals

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:06.150
are now linked to the skyrocketing incidents

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.150
of chronic childhood disease

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:11.150
that we're seeing across industrialized nations.

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:13.150
I'll show you some statistics.

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:15.150
So for example, in the United Kingdom,

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.150
the incidence of childhood leukemia

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:20.150
has risen by 20 percent just in a generation.

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:23.150
Very similar statistic for childhood cancer in the U.S.

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:27.150
In Canada, we're now looking at one in 10 Canadian children with asthma.

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:30.150
That's a four-fold increase.

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.150
Again, similar story around the world.

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:34.150
In the United States,

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:36.150
probably the most astonishing statistic

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.150
is a 600 percent increase

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:41.150
in autism and autistic spectrum disorders

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:43.150
and other learning disabilities.

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:45.150
Again, we're seeing that trend

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:47.150
across Europe, across North America.

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:49.150
And in Europe,

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:51.150
there's certain parts of Europe,

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:53.150
where we're seeing a four-fold increase

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:56.150
in certain genital birth defects.

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:58.150
Interestingly, one of those birth defects

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:01.150
has seen a 200 percent increase in the U.S.

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:03.150
So a real skyrocketing

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:05.150
of chronic childhood disease

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:07.150
that includes other things

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:09.150
like obesity and juvenile diabetes,

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:11.150
premature puberty.

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:13.150
So it's interesting for me,

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:15.150
when I'm looking for someone who can really talk to me

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:18.150
and talk to an audience about these things,

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:21.150
that probably one of the most important people in the world

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:24.150
who can discuss toxicity in babies

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:26.150
is expert in frogs.

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:28.150
(Laughter)

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:31.150
Tyrone Hayes: It was a surprise to me as well

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:34.150
that I would be talking about pesticides,

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:38.150
that I'd be talking about public health,

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:41.150
because, in fact, I never thought I would do anything useful.

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:44.150
(Laughter)

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:47.150
Frogs.

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:50.150
In fact, my involvement in the whole pesticide issue

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:52.150
was sort of a surprise as well

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:55.150
when I was approached by the largest chemical company in the world

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:57.150
and they asked me if I would evaluate

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:00.150
how atrazine affected amphibians, or my frogs.

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:03.150
It turns out, atrazine is the largest selling product

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:05.150
for the largest chemical company in the world.

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:07.150
It's the number one contaminant

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:10.150
of groundwater, drinking water, rain water.

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:13.150
In 2003, after my studies, it was banned in the European Union,

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:15.150
but in that same year,

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:17.150
the United States EPA re-registered the compound.

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:20.150
We were a bit surprised when we found out

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:22.150
that when we exposed frogs

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:25.150
to very low levels of atrazine -- 0.1 parts per billion --

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:28.150
that it produced animals that look like this.

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:30.150
These are the dissected gonads of an animal

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:32.150
that has two testes, two ovaries,

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:34.150
another large testis, more ovaries,

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:36.150
which is not normal ...

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:38.150
(Laughter)

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:40.150
even for amphibians.

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:43.150
In some cases, another species like the North American Leopard Frog

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:46.150
showed that males exposed to atrazine grew eggs in their testes.

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:48.150
And you can see these large, yolked-up eggs

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:51.150
bursting through the surface of this male's testes.

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:54.150
Now my wife tells me, and I'm sure Penelope can as well,

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:57.150
that there's nothing more painful than childbirth --

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:00.150
which that I'll never experience, I can't really argue that --

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:02.150
but I would guess that a dozen chicken eggs in my testicle

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:05.150
would probably be somewhere in the top five.

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:07.150
(Laughter)

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:09.150
In recent studies that we've published,

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:11.150
we've shown that some of these animals when they're exposed to atrazine,

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:13.150
some of the males grow up

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:15.150
and completely become females.

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:18.150
So these are actually two brothers consummating a relationship.

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:21.150
And not only do these genetic males mate with other males,

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:23.150
they actually have the capacity to lay eggs

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:26.150
even though they're genetic males.

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:28.150
What we proposed,

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:30.150
and what we've now generated support for,

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:32.150
is that what atrazine is doing

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:34.150
is wreaking havoc causing a hormone imbalance.

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:36.150
Normally the testes should make testosterone,

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:38.150
the male hormone.

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:41.150
But what atrazine does is it turns on an enzyme,

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:43.150
the machinery if you will, aromatase,

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:45.150
that converts testosterone into estrogen.

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:47.150
And as a result, these exposed males

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:50.150
lose their testosterone, they're chemically castrated,

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:52.150
and they're subsequently feminized

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:54.150
because now they're making the female hormone.

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:57.150
Now this is what brought me to the human-related issues.

00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:59.150
Because it turns out

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:02.150
that the number one cancer in women, breast cancer,

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:05.150
is regulated by estrogen and by this enzyme aromatase.

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:07.150
So when you develop a cancerous cell in your breast,

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:11.150
aromatase converts androgens into estrogens,

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:13.150
and that estrogen turns on or promotes

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:15.150
the growth of that cancer

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:18.150
so that it turns into a tumor and spreads.

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:21.150
In fact, this aromatase is so important in breast cancer

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:24.150
that the latest treatment for breast cancer

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:26.150
is a chemical called letrozole,

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:28.150
which blocks aromatase, blocks estrogen,

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:31.150
so that if you developed a mutated cell, it doesn't grow into a tumor.

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:33.150
Now what's interesting is, of course,

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:36.150
that we're still using 80 million pounds of atrazine,

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:39.150
the number one contaminant in drinking water, that does the opposite --

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:41.150
turns on aromatase, increases estrogen

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:43.150
and promotes tumors in rats

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:47.150
and is associated with tumors, breast cancer, in humans.

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:49.150
What's interesting is, in fact,

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:51.150
the same company that sold us 80 million pounds of atrazine,

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:53.150
the breast cancer promoter,

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:56.150
now sells us the blocker -- the exact same company.

00:05:56.150 --> 00:05:58.150
And so I find it interesting

00:05:58.150 --> 00:06:00.150
that instead of treating this disease

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:03.150
by preventing exposure to the chemicals that promote it,

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:05.150
we simply respond

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:08.150
by putting more chemicals into the environment.

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:10.150
PJC: So speaking of estrogen,

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:13.150
one of the other compounds that Tyrone talks about in the film

00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:16.150
is something called bisphenol A, BPA,

00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:19.150
which has been in the news recently.

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:21.150
It's a plasticizer.

00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:24.150
It's a compound that's found in polycarbonate plastic,

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:26.150
which is what baby bottles are made out of.

00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:28.150
And what's interesting about BPA

00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:31.150
is that it's such a potent estrogen

00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:33.150
that it was actually once considered for use

00:06:33.150 --> 00:06:36.150
as a synthetic estrogen in hormone placement therapy.

00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:39.150
And there have been many, many, many studies that have shown

00:06:39.150 --> 00:06:42.150
that BPA leaches from babies' bottles

00:06:42.150 --> 00:06:44.150
into the formula, into the milk,

00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:46.150
and therefore into the babies.

00:06:46.150 --> 00:06:48.150
So we're dosing our babies,

00:06:48.150 --> 00:06:50.150
our newborns, our infants,

00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:52.150
with a synthetic estrogen.

00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:54.150
Now two weeks ago or so,

00:06:54.150 --> 00:06:56.150
the European Union passed a law

00:06:56.150 --> 00:06:58.150
banning the use of BPA

00:06:58.150 --> 00:07:00.150
in babies' bottles and sippy cups.

00:07:00.150 --> 00:07:02.150
And for those of you who are not parents,

00:07:02.150 --> 00:07:04.150
sippy cups are those little plastic things

00:07:04.150 --> 00:07:07.150
that your child graduates to after using bottles.

00:07:07.150 --> 00:07:10.150
But just two weeks before that,

00:07:10.150 --> 00:07:13.150
the U.S. Senate refused to even debate

00:07:13.150 --> 00:07:15.150
the banning of BPA

00:07:15.150 --> 00:07:18.150
in babies' bottles and sippy cups.

00:07:18.150 --> 00:07:20.150
So it really makes you realize

00:07:20.150 --> 00:07:22.150
the onus on parents

00:07:22.150 --> 00:07:24.150
to have to look at this and regulate this and police this

00:07:24.150 --> 00:07:26.150
in their own lives

00:07:26.150 --> 00:07:28.150
and how astonishing that is.

00:07:28.150 --> 00:07:31.150
(Video) PJC: With many plastic baby bottles

00:07:31.150 --> 00:07:34.150
now proven to leak the chemical bisphenol A,

00:07:34.150 --> 00:07:36.150
it really shows how sometimes

00:07:36.150 --> 00:07:38.150
it is only a parent's awareness

00:07:38.150 --> 00:07:42.150
that stands between chemicals and our children.

00:07:42.150 --> 00:07:44.150
The baby bottle scenario proves

00:07:44.150 --> 00:07:47.150
that we can prevent unnecessary exposure.

00:07:47.150 --> 00:07:49.150
However, if we parents are unaware,

00:07:49.150 --> 00:07:51.150
we are leaving our children

00:07:51.150 --> 00:07:54.150
to fend for themselves.

00:08:00.150 --> 00:08:02.150
TH: And what Penelope says here

00:08:02.150 --> 00:08:04.150
is even more true.

00:08:04.150 --> 00:08:07.150
For those of you who don't know, we're in the middle of the sixth mass extinction.

00:08:07.150 --> 00:08:09.150
Scientists agree now.

00:08:09.150 --> 00:08:11.150
We are losing species from the Earth

00:08:11.150 --> 00:08:13.150
faster than the dinosaurs disappeared,

00:08:13.150 --> 00:08:15.150
and leading that loss are amphibians.

00:08:15.150 --> 00:08:17.150
80 percent of all amphibians

00:08:17.150 --> 00:08:19.150
are threatened and in come decline.

00:08:19.150 --> 00:08:21.150
And I believe, many scientists believe

00:08:21.150 --> 00:08:24.150
that pesticides are an important part of that decline.

00:08:24.150 --> 00:08:27.150
In part, amphibians are good indicators and more sensitive

00:08:27.150 --> 00:08:29.150
because they don't have protection from contaminants in the water --

00:08:29.150 --> 00:08:31.150
no eggshells, no membranes

00:08:31.150 --> 00:08:33.150
and no placenta.

00:08:33.150 --> 00:08:36.150
In fact, our invention -- by "our" I mean we mammals --

00:08:36.150 --> 00:08:39.150
one of our big inventions was the placenta.

00:08:39.150 --> 00:08:41.150
But we also start out as aquatic organisms.

00:08:41.150 --> 00:08:43.150
But it turns out that this ancient structure

00:08:43.150 --> 00:08:46.150
that separates us from other animals, the placenta,

00:08:46.150 --> 00:08:48.150
cannot evolve or adapt fast enough

00:08:48.150 --> 00:08:50.150
because of the rate that we're generating new chemicals

00:08:50.150 --> 00:08:52.150
that it's never seen before.

00:08:52.150 --> 00:08:55.150
The evidence of that is that studies in rats, again with atrazine,

00:08:55.150 --> 00:08:58.150
show that the hormone imbalance atrazine generates causes abortion.

00:08:58.150 --> 00:09:01.150
Because maintaining a pregnancy is dependent on hormones.

00:09:01.150 --> 00:09:03.150
Of those rats that don't abort,

00:09:03.150 --> 00:09:05.150
atrazine causes prostate disease

00:09:05.150 --> 00:09:07.150
in the pups so the sons

00:09:07.150 --> 00:09:09.150
are born with an old man's disease.

00:09:09.150 --> 00:09:11.150
Of those that don't abort,

00:09:11.150 --> 00:09:13.150
atrazine causes impaired mammary, or breast, development

00:09:13.150 --> 00:09:15.150
in the exposed daughters in utero,

00:09:15.150 --> 00:09:17.150
so that their breast don't develop properly.

00:09:17.150 --> 00:09:19.150
And as a result, when those rats grow up,

00:09:19.150 --> 00:09:22.150
their pups experience retarded growth and development

00:09:22.150 --> 00:09:25.150
because they can't make enough milk to nourish their pups.

00:09:25.150 --> 00:09:28.150
So the pup you see on the bottom is affected by atrazine

00:09:28.150 --> 00:09:30.150
that its grandmother was exposed to.

00:09:30.150 --> 00:09:33.150
And given the life of many of these chemicals,

00:09:33.150 --> 00:09:36.150
generations, years, dozens of years,

00:09:36.150 --> 00:09:38.150
that means that we right now

00:09:38.150 --> 00:09:40.150
are affecting the health

00:09:40.150 --> 00:09:42.150
of our grandchildren's grandchildren

00:09:42.150 --> 00:09:45.150
by things that we're putting into the environment today.

00:09:45.150 --> 00:09:47.150
And this is not just philosophical, it's already known,

00:09:47.150 --> 00:09:49.150
that chemicals like diethylstilbestrol and estrogen,

00:09:49.150 --> 00:09:51.150
PCBs, DDT

00:09:51.150 --> 00:09:53.150
cross the placenta

00:09:53.150 --> 00:09:55.150
and effectively determine

00:09:55.150 --> 00:09:57.150
the likelihood of developing breast cancer

00:09:57.150 --> 00:09:59.150
and obesity and diabetes

00:09:59.150 --> 00:10:01.150
already when the baby's in the womb.

00:10:01.150 --> 00:10:03.150
In addition to that, after the baby's born,

00:10:03.150 --> 00:10:05.150
our other unique invention as mammals

00:10:05.150 --> 00:10:07.150
is that we nourish our offspring after they're born.

00:10:07.150 --> 00:10:09.150
We already know that chemicals

00:10:09.150 --> 00:10:11.150
like DDT and DES and atrazine

00:10:11.150 --> 00:10:13.150
can also pass over into milk,

00:10:13.150 --> 00:10:15.150
again, affecting our babies

00:10:15.150 --> 00:10:17.150
even after their born.

00:10:18.150 --> 00:10:20.150
PJC: So when Tyrone tells me

00:10:20.150 --> 00:10:23.150
that the placenta is an ancient organ,

00:10:23.150 --> 00:10:25.150
I'm thinking, how do I demonstrate that?

00:10:25.150 --> 00:10:27.150
How do you show that?

00:10:27.150 --> 00:10:29.150
And it's interesting when you make a film like this,

00:10:29.150 --> 00:10:32.150
because you're stuck trying to visualize science

00:10:32.150 --> 00:10:34.150
that there's no visualization for.

00:10:34.150 --> 00:10:37.150
And I have to take a little bit of artistic license.

00:10:42.150 --> 00:10:47.150
(Video) (Ringing)

00:10:47.150 --> 00:10:49.150
Old man: Placenta control.

00:10:49.150 --> 00:10:51.150
What is it?

00:10:51.150 --> 00:10:54.150
Oh what?

00:10:54.150 --> 00:10:57.150
(Snoring)

00:10:57.150 --> 00:11:02.150
(Honk)

00:11:02.150 --> 00:11:06.150
Puffuffuff, what?

00:11:08.150 --> 00:11:12.150
Perflourooctanoic acid.

00:11:15.150 --> 00:11:17.150
Blimey.

00:11:17.150 --> 00:11:20.150
Never heard of it.

00:11:20.150 --> 00:11:24.150
PJC: And neither had I actually

00:11:24.150 --> 00:11:26.150
before I started making this film.

00:11:26.150 --> 00:11:29.150
And so when you realize that chemicals can pass the placenta

00:11:29.150 --> 00:11:32.150
and go into your unborn child,

00:11:32.150 --> 00:11:34.150
it made me start to think,

00:11:34.150 --> 00:11:37.150
what would my fetus say to me?

00:11:37.150 --> 00:11:40.150
What would our unborn children say to us

00:11:40.150 --> 00:11:43.150
when they have an exposure

00:11:43.150 --> 00:11:46.150
that's happening everyday, day after day?

00:11:46.150 --> 00:12:04.150
(Music)

00:12:04.150 --> 00:12:06.150
(Video) Child: Today,

00:12:06.150 --> 00:12:10.150
I had some octyphenols,

00:12:10.150 --> 00:12:13.150
some artificial musks

00:12:13.150 --> 00:12:18.150
and some bisphenol A.

00:12:18.150 --> 00:12:20.150
Help me.

00:12:23.150 --> 00:12:26.150
PJC: It's a very profound notion

00:12:26.150 --> 00:12:28.150
to know that we as women

00:12:28.150 --> 00:12:30.150
are at the vanguard of this.

00:12:30.150 --> 00:12:32.150
This is our issue,

00:12:32.150 --> 00:12:35.150
because we collect these compounds our entire life

00:12:35.150 --> 00:12:38.150
and then we end up dumping it and dumping them

00:12:38.150 --> 00:12:41.150
into our unborn children.

00:12:41.150 --> 00:12:43.150
We are in effect

00:12:43.150 --> 00:12:45.150
polluting our children.

00:12:45.150 --> 00:12:49.150
And this was something that was really brought home to me a year ago

00:12:49.150 --> 00:12:51.150
when I found out I was pregnant

00:12:51.150 --> 00:12:53.150
and the first scan revealed

00:12:53.150 --> 00:12:56.150
that my baby had a birth defect

00:12:56.150 --> 00:12:58.150
associated with exposure

00:12:58.150 --> 00:13:00.150
to estrogenic chemicals in the womb

00:13:00.150 --> 00:13:02.150
and the second scan

00:13:02.150 --> 00:13:04.150
revealed no heartbeat.

00:13:04.150 --> 00:13:07.150
So my child's death, my baby's death,

00:13:07.150 --> 00:13:10.150
really brought home the resonance of what I was trying to make in this film.

00:13:10.150 --> 00:13:12.150
And it's sometimes a weird place

00:13:12.150 --> 00:13:15.150
when the communicator becomes part of the story,

00:13:15.150 --> 00:13:17.150
which is not what you originally intend.

00:13:17.150 --> 00:13:20.150
And so when Tyrone talks about

00:13:20.150 --> 00:13:23.150
the fetus being trapped in a contaminated environment,

00:13:23.150 --> 00:13:27.150
this is my contaminated environment.

00:13:27.150 --> 00:13:30.150
This is my toxic baby.

00:13:30.150 --> 00:13:33.150
And that's something

00:13:33.150 --> 00:13:36.150
that's just profound and sad,

00:13:36.150 --> 00:13:38.150
but astonishing

00:13:38.150 --> 00:13:41.150
because so many of us don't actually know this.

00:13:43.150 --> 00:13:45.150
TH: One of this things that's exciting and appropriate

00:13:45.150 --> 00:13:47.150
for me to be here at TEDWomen

00:13:47.150 --> 00:13:51.150
is that, well, I think it was summed up best last night at dinner

00:13:51.150 --> 00:13:53.150
when someone said, "Turn to the man at your table and tell them,

00:13:53.150 --> 00:13:56.150
'When the revolution starts, we've got your back.'"

00:13:56.150 --> 00:13:58.150
The truth is, women,

00:13:58.150 --> 00:14:01.150
you've had our back on this issue for a very long time,

00:14:01.150 --> 00:14:03.150
starting with Rachel Carson's "Silent Spring"

00:14:03.150 --> 00:14:05.150
to Theo Colborn's "Our Stolen Future"

00:14:05.150 --> 00:14:07.150
to Sandra Steingraber's books

00:14:07.150 --> 00:14:10.150
"Living Downstream" and "Having Faith."

00:14:10.150 --> 00:14:13.150
And perhaps it's the connection to our next generation --

00:14:13.150 --> 00:14:16.150
like my wife and my beautiful daughter here about 13 years ago --

00:14:16.150 --> 00:14:18.150
perhaps it's that connection

00:14:18.150 --> 00:14:20.150
that makes women activists

00:14:20.150 --> 00:14:22.150
in this particular area.

00:14:22.150 --> 00:14:24.150
But for the men here, I want to say

00:14:24.150 --> 00:14:26.150
it's not just women and children that are at risk.

00:14:26.150 --> 00:14:29.150
And the frogs that are exposed to atrazine,

00:14:29.150 --> 00:14:31.150
the testes are full of holes and spaces,

00:14:31.150 --> 00:14:33.150
because the hormone imbalance,

00:14:33.150 --> 00:14:35.150
instead of allowing sperm to be generated,

00:14:35.150 --> 00:14:37.150
such as in the testis here,

00:14:37.150 --> 00:14:39.150
the testicular tubules end up empty

00:14:39.150 --> 00:14:41.150
and fertility goes down by as much as 50 percent.

00:14:41.150 --> 00:14:44.150
It's not just my work in amphibians,

00:14:44.150 --> 00:14:47.150
but similar work has been shown in fish in Europe,

00:14:47.150 --> 00:14:50.150
holes in the testes and absence of sperm in reptiles in a group from South America

00:14:50.150 --> 00:14:52.150
and in rats, an absence of sperm

00:14:52.150 --> 00:14:55.150
in the testicular tubules as well.

00:14:55.150 --> 00:14:57.150
And of course, we don't do these experiments in humans,

00:14:57.150 --> 00:14:59.150
but just by coincidence,

00:14:59.150 --> 00:15:01.150
my colleague has shown

00:15:01.150 --> 00:15:03.150
that men who have low sperm count, low semen quality

00:15:03.150 --> 00:15:06.150
have significantly more atrazine in their urine.

00:15:06.150 --> 00:15:08.150
These are just men who live

00:15:08.150 --> 00:15:10.150
in an agricultural community.

00:15:10.150 --> 00:15:12.150
Men who actually work in agriculture

00:15:12.150 --> 00:15:15.150
have much higher levels of atrazine.

00:15:15.150 --> 00:15:17.150
And the men who actually apply atrazine

00:15:17.150 --> 00:15:20.150
have even more atrazine in their urine,

00:15:20.150 --> 00:15:23.150
up to levels that are 24,000 times what we know to be active

00:15:23.150 --> 00:15:26.150
are present in the urine of these men.

00:15:26.150 --> 00:15:29.150
Of course, most of them, 90 percent are Mexican, Mexican-American.

00:15:29.150 --> 00:15:31.150
And it's not just atrazine they're exposed to.

00:15:31.150 --> 00:15:34.150
They're exposed to chemicals like chloropicrin,

00:15:34.150 --> 00:15:36.150
which was originally used as a nerve gas.

00:15:36.150 --> 00:15:38.150
And many of these workers

00:15:38.150 --> 00:15:40.150
have life expectancies of only 50.

00:15:40.150 --> 00:15:43.150
It shouldn't come to any surprise that the things that happen in wildlife

00:15:43.150 --> 00:15:45.150
are also a warning to us,

00:15:45.150 --> 00:15:47.150
just like Rachel Carson and others have warned.

00:15:47.150 --> 00:15:50.150
As evident in this slide from Lake Nabugabo in Uganda,

00:15:50.150 --> 00:15:52.150
the agricultural runoff from this crop,

00:15:52.150 --> 00:15:54.150
which goes into these buckets,

00:15:54.150 --> 00:15:57.150
is the sole source of drinking, cooking and bathing water for this village.

00:15:57.150 --> 00:15:59.150
Now if I told the men in this village

00:15:59.150 --> 00:16:01.150
that the frogs have pour immune function

00:16:01.150 --> 00:16:03.150
and eggs developing in their testes,

00:16:03.150 --> 00:16:05.150
the connection between environmental health and public health

00:16:05.150 --> 00:16:07.150
would be clear.

00:16:07.150 --> 00:16:10.150
You would not drink water that you knew was having this kind of impact

00:16:10.150 --> 00:16:12.150
on the wildlife that lived in it.

00:16:12.150 --> 00:16:14.150
The problem is, in my village, Oakland,

00:16:14.150 --> 00:16:16.150
in most of our villages,

00:16:16.150 --> 00:16:18.150
we don't see that connection.

00:16:18.150 --> 00:16:20.150
We turn on the faucet, the water comes out, we assume it's safe,

00:16:20.150 --> 00:16:23.150
and we assume that we are masters of our environment,

00:16:23.150 --> 00:16:26.150
rather than being part of it.

00:16:26.150 --> 00:16:28.150
PJC: So it doesn't take much to realize

00:16:28.150 --> 00:16:31.150
that actually this is an environmental issue.

00:16:31.150 --> 00:16:34.150
And I kept thinking over and over again

00:16:34.150 --> 00:16:36.150
this question.

00:16:36.150 --> 00:16:39.150
We know so much about global warming and climate change,

00:16:39.150 --> 00:16:41.150
and yet, we have no concept

00:16:41.150 --> 00:16:43.150
of what I've been calling internal environmentalism.

00:16:43.150 --> 00:16:45.150
We know what we're putting out there,

00:16:45.150 --> 00:16:47.150
we have a sense of those repercussions,

00:16:47.150 --> 00:16:49.150
but we are so ignorant of this sense

00:16:49.150 --> 00:16:52.150
of what happens when we put things, or things are put

00:16:52.150 --> 00:16:54.150
into our bodies.

00:16:54.150 --> 00:16:56.150
And it's my feeling

00:16:56.150 --> 00:16:58.150
and it's my urging being here

00:16:58.150 --> 00:17:00.150
to know that, as we women move forward

00:17:00.150 --> 00:17:02.150
as the communicators of this,

00:17:02.150 --> 00:17:05.150
but also as the ones who carry that burden

00:17:05.150 --> 00:17:08.150
of carrying the children, bearing the children,

00:17:08.150 --> 00:17:11.150
we hold most of the buying power in the household,

00:17:11.150 --> 00:17:14.150
is that it's going to be us moving forward

00:17:14.150 --> 00:17:17.150
to carry the work of Tyrone and other scientists around the world.

00:17:17.150 --> 00:17:19.150
And my urging is

00:17:19.150 --> 00:17:21.150
that when we think about environmental issues

00:17:21.150 --> 00:17:25.150
that we remember that it's not just about melting glaciers and ice caps,

00:17:25.150 --> 00:17:27.150
but it's also about our children as well.

00:17:27.150 --> 00:17:29.150
Thank you.

00:17:29.150 --> 00:17:39.150
(Applause)
