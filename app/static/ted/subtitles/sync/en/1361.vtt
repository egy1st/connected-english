00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.150
The humanitarian model has barely changed

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:17.150
since the early 20th century.

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:19.150
Its origins are firmly rooted

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:21.150
in the analog age.

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:25.150
And there is a major shift coming on the horizon.

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:27.150
The catalyst for this change

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.150
was the major earthquake that struck Haiti

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:34.150
on the 12th of January in 2010.

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:37.150
Haiti was a game changer.

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:41.150
The earthquake destroyed the capital of Port-au-Prince,

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:44.150
claiming the lives of some 320,000 people,

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:46.150
rendering homeless

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:49.150
about 1.2 million people.

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:52.150
Government institutions were completely decapitated,

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:55.150
including the presidential palace.

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:57.150
I remember standing

00:00:57.150 --> 00:00:59.150
on the roof of the Ministry of Justice

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:01.150
in downtown Port-au-Prince.

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:03.150
It was about two meters high,

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:05.150
completely squashed

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:07.150
by the violence of the earthquake.

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:10.150
For those of us on the ground in those early days,

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:13.150
it was clear for even the most disaster-hardened veterans

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:15.150
that Haiti was something different.

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:18.150
Haiti was something we hadn't seen before.

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:22.150
But Haiti provided us with something else unprecedented.

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:25.150
Haiti allowed us to glimpse into a future

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:28.150
of what disaster response might look like

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:30.150
in a hyper-connected world

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.150
where people have access

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:35.150
to mobile smart devices.

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:37.150
Because out of the urban devastation

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:39.150
in Port-au-Prince

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:42.150
came a torrent of SMS texts --

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.150
people crying for help,

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:46.150
beseeching us for assistance,

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:48.150
sharing data, offering support,

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:50.150
looking for their loved ones.

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:52.150
This was a situation

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:55.150
that traditional aid agencies had never before encountered.

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:58.150
We were in one of the poorest countries on the planet,

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:01.150
but 80 percent of the people

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:03.150
had mobile devices in their hands.

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:05.150
And we were unprepared for this,

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:08.150
and they were shaping the aid effort.

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:11.150
Outside Haiti also, things were looking different.

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:14.150
Tens of thousands of so-called digital volunteers

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:16.150
were scouring the Internet,

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:18.150
converting tweets

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:20.150
that had already been converted from texts

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:22.150
and putting these into open-source maps,

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:25.150
layering them with all sorts of important information --

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:28.150
people like Crisis Mappers and Open Street Map --

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:30.150
and putting these on the Web for everybody --

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:33.150
the media, the aid organizations and the communities themselves --

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:36.150
to participate in and to use.

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:38.150
Back in Haiti,

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:40.150
people were increasingly turning

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:42.150
to the medium of SMS.

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:44.150
People that were hungry and hurting

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:46.150
were signaling their distress,

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:49.150
were signaling their need for help.

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:52.150
On street sides all over Port-au-Prince,

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:54.150
entrepreneurs sprung up

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:57.150
offering mobile phone charging stations.

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:59.150
They understood more than we did

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:01.150
people's innate need

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:03.150
to be connected.

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:05.150
Never having been confronted

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:07.150
with this type of situation before,

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:09.150
we wanted to try and understand

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:12.150
how we could tap into this incredible resource,

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:14.150
how we could really leverage

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:16.150
this incredible use of mobile technology

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:18.150
and SMS technology.

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:22.150
We started talking with a local telecom provider called VoilÃ ,

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:26.150
which is a subsidiary of Trilogy International.

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:28.150
We had basically three requirements.

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:30.150
We wanted to communicate

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:32.150
in a two-way form of communication.

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:35.150
We didn't want to shout; we needed to listen as well.

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:37.150
We wanted to be able to target

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:39.150
specific geographic communities.

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:42.150
We didn't need to talk to the whole country at the same time.

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:45.150
And we wanted it to be easy to use.

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:48.150
Out of this rubble of Haiti and from this devastation

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:50.150
came something that we call TERA --

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:53.150
the Trilogy Emergency Response Application --

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:55.150
which has been used to support the aid effort

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:57.150
ever since.

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:00.150
It has been used to help communities prepare for disasters.

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:03.150
It has been used to signal early warning

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:05.150
in advance of weather-related disasters.

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:08.150
It's used for public health awareness campaigns

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:10.150
such as the prevention of cholera.

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:13.150
And it is even used for sensitive issues

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:15.150
such as building awareness

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:17.150
around gender-based violence.

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:20.150
But does it work?

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:22.150
We have just published

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:25.150
an evaluation of this program,

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:28.150
and the evidence that is there for all to see

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:31.150
is quite remarkable.

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:33.150
Some 74 percent of people

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:35.150
received the data.

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:37.150
Those who were intended to receive the data,

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:39.150
74 percent of them received it.

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:41.150
96 percent of them

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:43.150
found it useful.

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:46.150
83 percent of them took action --

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:48.150
evidence that it is indeed empowering.

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:52.150
And 73 percent of them shared it.

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:54.150
The TERA system

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:56.150
was developed from Haiti

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:59.150
with support of engineers in the region.

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:01.150
It is a user-appropriate technology

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:04.150
that has been used for humanitarian good to great effect.

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:07.150
Technology is transformational.

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:09.150
Right across the developing world,

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:11.150
citizens and communities

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:13.150
are using technology

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:15.150
to enable them to bring about change, positive change,

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:17.150
in their own communities.

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:19.150
The grassroots has been strengthened

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:21.150
through the social power of sharing

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:23.150
and they are challenging the old models,

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:25.150
the old analog models

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:28.150
of control and command.

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:31.150
One illustration of the transformational power of technology

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:33.150
is in Kibera.

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:35.150
Kibera is one of Africa's largest slums.

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:37.150
It's on the outskirts of Nairobi,

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:39.150
the capital city of Kenya.

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:41.150
It's home to an unknown number of people --

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:43.150
some say between 250,000

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:45.150
and 1.2 million.

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:47.150
If you were to arrive in Nairobi today

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:49.150
and pick up a tourist map,

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:51.150
Kibera is represented

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:53.150
as a lush, green national park

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:55.150
devoid of human settlement.

00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:57.150
Young people living in Kibera

00:05:57.150 --> 00:05:59.150
in their community,

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:01.150
with simple handheld devices,

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:05.150
GPS handheld devices and SMS-enabled mobile phones,

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:07.150
have literally put themselves on the map.

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:09.150
They have collated crowd-sourced data

00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:12.150
and rendered the invisible visible.

00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:15.150
People like Josh and Steve

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:18.150
are continuing to layer information upon information,

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:21.150
real-time information, Tweet it and text it onto these maps

00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:23.150
for all to use.

00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:26.150
You can find out about the latest impromptu music session.

00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:28.150
You can find out about the latest security incident.

00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:30.150
You can find out about places of worship.

00:06:30.150 --> 00:06:32.150
You can find out about the health centers.

00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:34.150
You can feel the dynamism

00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:36.150
of this living, breathing community.

00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:39.150
They also have their own news network on YouTube

00:06:39.150 --> 00:06:42.150
with 36,000 viewers at the moment.

00:06:42.150 --> 00:06:45.150
They're showing us what can be done

00:06:45.150 --> 00:06:47.150
with mobile, digital technologies.

00:06:47.150 --> 00:06:49.150
They're showing that the magic of technology

00:06:49.150 --> 00:06:51.150
can bring the invisible visible.

00:06:51.150 --> 00:06:53.150
And they are giving a voice to themselves.

00:06:53.150 --> 00:06:56.150
They are telling their own story,

00:06:56.150 --> 00:06:58.150
bypassing the official narrative.

00:06:58.150 --> 00:07:01.150
And we're seeing from all points on the globe similar stories.

00:07:01.150 --> 00:07:03.150
In Mongolia for instance,

00:07:03.150 --> 00:07:05.150
where 30 percent of the people are nomadic,

00:07:05.150 --> 00:07:08.150
SMS information systems are being used

00:07:08.150 --> 00:07:10.150
to track migration and weather patterns.

00:07:10.150 --> 00:07:12.150
SMS is even used

00:07:12.150 --> 00:07:14.150
to hold herder summits

00:07:14.150 --> 00:07:16.150
from remote participation.

00:07:16.150 --> 00:07:18.150
And if people are migrating

00:07:18.150 --> 00:07:20.150
into urban, unfamiliar, concrete environments,

00:07:20.150 --> 00:07:22.150
they can also be helped in anticipation

00:07:22.150 --> 00:07:25.150
with social supporters ready and waiting for them

00:07:25.150 --> 00:07:27.150
based on SMS knowledge.

00:07:27.150 --> 00:07:29.150
In Nigeria,

00:07:29.150 --> 00:07:32.150
open-source SMS tools

00:07:32.150 --> 00:07:35.150
are being used by the Red Cross community workers

00:07:35.150 --> 00:07:38.150
to gather information from the local community

00:07:38.150 --> 00:07:40.150
in an attempt to better understand and mitigate

00:07:40.150 --> 00:07:42.150
the prevalence of malaria.

00:07:42.150 --> 00:07:45.150
My colleague, Jason Peat, who runs this program,

00:07:45.150 --> 00:07:48.150
tells me it's 10 times faster and 10 times cheaper

00:07:48.150 --> 00:07:51.150
than the traditional way of doing things.

00:07:51.150 --> 00:07:53.150
And not only is it empowering to the communities,

00:07:53.150 --> 00:07:55.150
but really importantly,

00:07:55.150 --> 00:07:57.150
this information stays in the community

00:07:57.150 --> 00:08:00.150
where it is needed to formulate long-term health polices.

00:08:01.150 --> 00:08:03.150
We are on a planet

00:08:03.150 --> 00:08:06.150
of seven billion people,

00:08:06.150 --> 00:08:09.150
five billion mobile subscriptions.

00:08:09.150 --> 00:08:11.150
By 2015,

00:08:11.150 --> 00:08:15.150
there will be three billion smartphones in the world.

00:08:16.150 --> 00:08:18.150
The U.N. broadband commission

00:08:18.150 --> 00:08:20.150
has recently set targets

00:08:20.150 --> 00:08:22.150
to help broadband access

00:08:22.150 --> 00:08:25.150
in 50 percent of the Developing World,

00:08:25.150 --> 00:08:27.150
compared to 20 percent today.

00:08:27.150 --> 00:08:30.150
We are hurtling towards a hyper-connected world

00:08:30.150 --> 00:08:33.150
where citizens from all cultures and all social strata

00:08:33.150 --> 00:08:37.150
will have access to smart, fast mobile devices.

00:08:37.150 --> 00:08:39.150
People are understanding,

00:08:39.150 --> 00:08:41.150
from Cairo to Oakland,

00:08:41.150 --> 00:08:43.150
that there are new ways to come together,

00:08:43.150 --> 00:08:45.150
there are new ways to mobilize,

00:08:45.150 --> 00:08:48.150
there are new ways to influence.

00:08:49.150 --> 00:08:52.150
A transformation is coming which needs to be understood

00:08:52.150 --> 00:08:55.150
by the humanitarian structures and humanitarian models.

00:08:55.150 --> 00:08:57.150
The collective voices of people

00:08:57.150 --> 00:09:00.150
needs to be more integrated through new technologies

00:09:00.150 --> 00:09:02.150
into the organizational strategies and plans of actions

00:09:02.150 --> 00:09:04.150
and not just recycled

00:09:04.150 --> 00:09:06.150
for fundraising or marketing.

00:09:06.150 --> 00:09:08.150
We need to, for example, embrace

00:09:08.150 --> 00:09:10.150
the big data,

00:09:10.150 --> 00:09:12.150
the knowledge that is there from market leaders

00:09:12.150 --> 00:09:14.150
who understand what it means

00:09:14.150 --> 00:09:17.150
to use and leverage big data.

00:09:17.150 --> 00:09:20.150
One idea that I'd like you to consider, for instance,

00:09:20.150 --> 00:09:23.150
is to take a look at our IT departments.

00:09:23.150 --> 00:09:26.150
They're normally backroom or basement hardware service providers,

00:09:26.150 --> 00:09:29.150
but they need to be elevated to software strategists.

00:09:29.150 --> 00:09:31.150
We need people in our organizations

00:09:31.150 --> 00:09:33.150
who know what it's like to work with big data.

00:09:33.150 --> 00:09:35.150
We need technology

00:09:35.150 --> 00:09:37.150
as a core organizational principle.

00:09:37.150 --> 00:09:40.150
We need technological strategists in the boardroom

00:09:40.150 --> 00:09:42.150
who can ask and answer the question,

00:09:42.150 --> 00:09:44.150
"What would Amazon or Google

00:09:44.150 --> 00:09:46.150
do with all of this data?"

00:09:46.150 --> 00:09:48.150
and convert it to humanitarian good.

00:09:50.150 --> 00:09:52.150
The possibilities

00:09:52.150 --> 00:09:54.150
that new digital technologies are bringing

00:09:54.150 --> 00:09:56.150
can help humanitarian organizations,

00:09:56.150 --> 00:09:58.150
not only ensure

00:09:58.150 --> 00:10:00.150
that people's right to information is met,

00:10:00.150 --> 00:10:03.150
or that they have their right to communicate,

00:10:03.150 --> 00:10:05.150
but I think in the future,

00:10:05.150 --> 00:10:08.150
humanitarian organizations will also have to anticipate

00:10:08.150 --> 00:10:10.150
the right for people to access

00:10:10.150 --> 00:10:12.150
critical communication technologies

00:10:12.150 --> 00:10:14.150
in order to ensure

00:10:14.150 --> 00:10:16.150
that their voices are heard,

00:10:16.150 --> 00:10:18.150
that they're truly participating,

00:10:18.150 --> 00:10:21.150
that they're truly empowered in the humanitarian world.

00:10:21.150 --> 00:10:24.150
It has always been the elusive ideal

00:10:24.150 --> 00:10:27.150
to ensure full participation of people affected by disasters

00:10:27.150 --> 00:10:30.150
in the humanitarian effort.

00:10:30.150 --> 00:10:33.150
We now have the tools. We now have the possibilities.

00:10:33.150 --> 00:10:37.150
There are no more reasons not to do it.

00:10:37.150 --> 00:10:40.150
I believe we need to bring the humanitarian world

00:10:40.150 --> 00:10:42.150
from analog to digital.

00:10:42.150 --> 00:10:44.150
Thank you very much.

00:10:44.150 --> 00:10:48.150
