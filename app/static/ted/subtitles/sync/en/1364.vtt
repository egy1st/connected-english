WEBVTT

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:14.150
The things we make

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:17.150
have one supreme quality --

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:19.150
they live longer than us.

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:21.150
We perish, they survive;

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.150
we have one life, they have many lives,

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.150
and in each life they can mean different things.

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.150
Which means that, while we all have one biography,

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.150
they have many.

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:34.150
I want this morning to talk

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:37.150
about the story, the biography -- or rather the biographies --

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:40.150
of one particular object,

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:42.150
one remarkable thing.

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:44.150
It doesn't, I agree,

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:46.150
look very much.

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:49.150
It's about the size of a rugby ball.

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:51.150
It's made of clay,

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:53.150
and it's been fashioned

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:56.150
into a cylinder shape,

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:58.150
covered with close writing

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:01.150
and then baked dry in the sun.

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:03.150
And as you can see,

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:05.150
it's been knocked about a bit,

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:07.150
which is not surprising

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:10.150
because it was made two and a half thousand years ago

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:12.150
and was dug up

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.150
in 1879.

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:16.150
But today,

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:18.150
this thing is, I believe,

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.150
a major player

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:22.150
in the politics of the Middle East.

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:24.150
And it's an object

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.150
with fascinating stories

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:30.150
and stories that are by no means over yet.

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.150
The story begins

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:36.150
in the Iran-Iraq war

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.150
and that series of events

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:40.150
that culminated

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:42.150
in the invasion of Iraq

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.150
by foreign forces,

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:46.150
the removal of a despotic ruler

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:49.150
and instant regime change.

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:51.150
And I want to begin

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:53.150
with one episode from that sequence of events

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:56.150
that most of you would be very familiar with,

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:58.150
Belshazzar's feast --

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:00.150
because we're talking about the Iran-Iraq war

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:03.150
of 539 BC.

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:05.150
And the parallels

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:07.150
between the events

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:10.150
of 539 BC and 2003 and in between

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:12.150
are startling.

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:14.150
What you're looking at is Rembrandt's painting,

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:16.150
now in the National Gallery in London,

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:18.150
illustrating the text from the prophet Daniel

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:21.150
in the Hebrew scriptures.

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:23.150
And you all know roughly the story.

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:26.150
Belshazzar, the son of Nebuchadnezzar,

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:29.150
Nebuchadnezzar who'd conquered Israel, sacked Jerusalem

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:31.150
and captured the people

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:33.150
and taken the Jews back to Babylon.

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:36.150
Not only the Jews, he'd taken the temple vessels.

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:39.150
He'd ransacked, desecrated the temple.

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:42.150
And the great gold vessels of the temple in Jerusalem

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:45.150
had been taken to Babylon.

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:47.150
Belshazzar, his son,

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:49.150
decides to have a feast.

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:51.150
And in order to make it even more exciting,

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:54.150
he added a bit of sacrilege to the rest of the fun,

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:57.150
and he brings out the temple vessels.

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:00.150
He's already at war with the Iranians,

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:02.150
with the king of Persia.

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:05.150
And that night, Daniel tells us,

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:07.150
at the height of the festivities

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:10.150
a hand appeared and wrote on the wall,

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:13.150
"You are weighed in the balance and found wanting,

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:15.150
and your kingdom is handed over

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:17.150
to the Medes and the Persians."

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:19.150
And that very night

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:23.150
Cyrus, king of the Persians, entered Babylon

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:28.150
and the whole regime of Belshazzar fell.

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:30.150
It is, of course, a great moment

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:32.150
in the history

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:34.150
of the Jewish people.

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:36.150
It's a great story. It's story we all know.

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:38.150
"The writing on the wall"

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:41.150
is part of our everyday language.

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:43.150
What happened next

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:45.150
was remarkable,

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:47.150
and it's where our cylinder

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:49.150
enters the story.

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:51.150
Cyrus, king of the Persians,

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:53.150
has entered Babylon without a fight --

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:55.150
the great empire of Babylon,

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:57.150
which ran from central southern Iraq

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:59.150
to the Mediterranean,

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:01.150
falls to Cyrus.

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:05.150
And Cyrus makes a declaration.

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:08.150
And that is what this cylinder is,

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:11.150
the declaration made by the ruler guided by God

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:15.150
who had toppled the Iraqi despot

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:17.150
and was going to bring freedom to the people.

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:19.150
In ringing Babylonian --

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:21.150
it was written in Babylonian --

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:24.150
he says, "I am Cyrus, king of all the universe,

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:26.150
the great king, the powerful king,

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:30.150
king of Babylon, king of the four quarters of the world."

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:33.150
They're not shy of hyperbole as you can see.

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:35.150
This is probably

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:37.150
the first real press release

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:39.150
by a victorious army

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:41.150
that we've got.

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:43.150
And it's written, as we'll see in due course,

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:46.150
by very skilled P.R. consultants.

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:49.150
So the hyperbole is not actually surprising.

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:51.150
And what is the great king, the powerful king,

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:54.150
the king of the four quarters of the world going to do?

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:57.150
He goes on to say that, having conquered Babylon,

00:04:57.150 --> 00:05:00.150
he will at once let all the peoples

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:02.150
that the Babylonians -- Nebuchadnezzar and Belshazzar --

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:04.150
have captured and enslaved

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:06.150
go free.

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:08.150
He'll let them return to their countries.

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:10.150
And more important,

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:12.150
he will let them all recover

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:14.150
the gods, the statues,

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:16.150
the temple vessels

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:18.150
that had been confiscated.

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:21.150
All the peoples that the Babylonians had repressed and removed

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:23.150
will go home,

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:26.150
and they'll take with them their gods.

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:29.150
And they'll be able to restore their altars

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:31.150
and to worship their gods

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:34.150
in their own way, in their own place.

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:36.150
This is the decree,

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:39.150
this object is the evidence

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:41.150
for the fact that the Jews,

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:43.150
after the exile in Babylon,

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:46.150
the years they'd spent sitting by the waters of Babylon,

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:49.150
weeping when they remembered Jerusalem,

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:52.150
those Jews were allowed to go home.

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:54.150
They were allowed to return to Jerusalem

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:56.150
and to rebuild the temple.

00:05:56.150 --> 00:05:58.150
It's a central document

00:05:58.150 --> 00:06:00.150
in Jewish history.

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:04.150
And the Book of Chronicles, the Book of Ezra in the Hebrew scriptures

00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:06.150
reported in ringing terms.

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:08.150
This is the Jewish version

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:10.150
of the same story.

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:12.150
"Thus said Cyrus, king of Persia,

00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:15.150
'All the kingdoms of the earth have the Lord God of heaven given thee,

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:17.150
and he has charged me

00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:19.150
to build him a house in Jerusalem.

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:21.150
Who is there among you of his people?

00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:23.150
The Lord God be with him,

00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:26.150
and let him go up.'"

00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:28.150
"Go up" -- aaleh.

00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:31.150
The central element, still,

00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:33.150
of the notion of return,

00:06:33.150 --> 00:06:35.150
a central part

00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:37.150
of the life of Judaism.

00:06:37.150 --> 00:06:39.150
As you all know, that return from exile,

00:06:39.150 --> 00:06:41.150
the second temple,

00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:43.150
reshaped Judaism.

00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:45.150
And that change,

00:06:45.150 --> 00:06:47.150
that great historic moment,

00:06:47.150 --> 00:06:51.150
was made possible by Cyrus, the king of Persia,

00:06:51.150 --> 00:06:54.150
reported for us in Hebrew in scripture

00:06:54.150 --> 00:06:57.150
and in Babylonian in clay.

00:06:57.150 --> 00:06:59.150
Two great texts,

00:06:59.150 --> 00:07:01.150
what about the politics?

00:07:01.150 --> 00:07:03.150
What was going on

00:07:03.150 --> 00:07:06.150
was the fundamental shift in Middle Eastern history.

00:07:06.150 --> 00:07:09.150
The empire of Iran, the Medes and the Persians,

00:07:09.150 --> 00:07:11.150
united under Cyrus,

00:07:11.150 --> 00:07:15.150
became the first great world empire.

00:07:15.150 --> 00:07:18.150
Cyrus begins in the 530s BC.

00:07:18.150 --> 00:07:22.150
And by the time of his son Darius,

00:07:22.150 --> 00:07:25.150
the whole of the eastern Mediterranean

00:07:25.150 --> 00:07:27.150
is under Persian control.

00:07:27.150 --> 00:07:29.150
This empire is, in fact,

00:07:29.150 --> 00:07:31.150
the Middle East as we now know it,

00:07:31.150 --> 00:07:34.150
and it's what shapes the Middle East as we now know it.

00:07:34.150 --> 00:07:36.150
It was the largest empire the world had known until then.

00:07:36.150 --> 00:07:38.150
Much more important,

00:07:38.150 --> 00:07:40.150
it was the first

00:07:40.150 --> 00:07:42.150
multicultural, multifaith state

00:07:42.150 --> 00:07:44.150
on a huge scale.

00:07:44.150 --> 00:07:46.150
And it had to be run in a quite new way.

00:07:46.150 --> 00:07:48.150
It had to be run in different languages.

00:07:48.150 --> 00:07:51.150
The fact that this decree is in Babylonian says one thing.

00:07:51.150 --> 00:07:53.150
And it had to recognize their different habits,

00:07:53.150 --> 00:07:56.150
different peoples, different religions, different faiths.

00:07:56.150 --> 00:07:59.150
All of those are respected by Cyrus.

00:07:59.150 --> 00:08:01.150
Cyrus sets up a model

00:08:01.150 --> 00:08:03.150
of how you run

00:08:03.150 --> 00:08:08.150
a great multinational, multifaith, multicultural society.

00:08:08.150 --> 00:08:10.150
And the result of that

00:08:10.150 --> 00:08:13.150
was an empire that included the areas you see on the screen,

00:08:13.150 --> 00:08:16.150
and which survived for 200 years of stability

00:08:16.150 --> 00:08:19.150
until it was shattered by Alexander.

00:08:19.150 --> 00:08:21.150
It left a dream of the Middle East as a unit,

00:08:21.150 --> 00:08:23.150
and a unit where people of different faiths

00:08:23.150 --> 00:08:25.150
could live together.

00:08:25.150 --> 00:08:27.150
The Greek invasions ended that.

00:08:27.150 --> 00:08:30.150
And of course, Alexander couldn't sustain a government

00:08:30.150 --> 00:08:32.150
and it fragmented.

00:08:32.150 --> 00:08:34.150
But what Cyrus represented

00:08:34.150 --> 00:08:36.150
remained absolutely central.

00:08:36.150 --> 00:08:39.150
The Greek historian Xenophon

00:08:39.150 --> 00:08:41.150
wrote his book "Cyropaedia"

00:08:41.150 --> 00:08:43.150
promoting Cyrus as the great ruler.

00:08:43.150 --> 00:08:46.150
And throughout European culture afterward,

00:08:46.150 --> 00:08:49.150
Cyrus remained the model.

00:08:49.150 --> 00:08:51.150
This is a 16th century image

00:08:51.150 --> 00:08:53.150
to show you how widespread

00:08:53.150 --> 00:08:56.150
his veneration actually was.

00:08:56.150 --> 00:08:58.150
And Xenophon's book on Cyrus

00:08:58.150 --> 00:09:01.150
on how you ran a diverse society

00:09:01.150 --> 00:09:03.150
was one of the great textbooks

00:09:03.150 --> 00:09:05.150
that inspired the Founding Fathers

00:09:05.150 --> 00:09:07.150
of the American Revolution.

00:09:07.150 --> 00:09:09.150
Jefferson was a great admirer --

00:09:09.150 --> 00:09:11.150
the ideals of Cyrus

00:09:11.150 --> 00:09:13.150
obviously speaking to those 18th century ideals

00:09:13.150 --> 00:09:15.150
of how you create religious tolerance

00:09:15.150 --> 00:09:18.150
in a new state.

00:09:20.150 --> 00:09:22.150
Meanwhile, back in Babylon,

00:09:22.150 --> 00:09:24.150
things had not been going well.

00:09:24.150 --> 00:09:27.150
After Alexander, the other empires,

00:09:27.150 --> 00:09:30.150
Babylon declines, falls into ruins,

00:09:30.150 --> 00:09:34.150
and all the traces of the great Babylonian empire are lost --

00:09:34.150 --> 00:09:36.150
until 1879

00:09:36.150 --> 00:09:39.150
when the cylinder is discovered

00:09:39.150 --> 00:09:42.150
by a British Museum exhibition digging in Babylon.

00:09:42.150 --> 00:09:45.150
And it enters now another story.

00:09:45.150 --> 00:09:47.150
It enters that great debate

00:09:47.150 --> 00:09:49.150
in the middle of the 19th century:

00:09:49.150 --> 00:09:52.150
Are the scriptures reliable? Can we trust them?

00:09:52.150 --> 00:09:54.150
We only knew

00:09:54.150 --> 00:09:56.150
about the return of the Jews and the decree of Cyrus

00:09:56.150 --> 00:09:58.150
from the Hebrew scriptures.

00:09:58.150 --> 00:10:00.150
No other evidence.

00:10:00.150 --> 00:10:02.150
Suddenly, this appeared.

00:10:02.150 --> 00:10:04.150
And great excitement

00:10:04.150 --> 00:10:06.150
to a world where those who believed in the scriptures

00:10:06.150 --> 00:10:08.150
had had their faith in creation shaken

00:10:08.150 --> 00:10:10.150
by evolution, by geology,

00:10:10.150 --> 00:10:12.150
here was evidence

00:10:12.150 --> 00:10:14.150
that the scriptures were historically true.

00:10:14.150 --> 00:10:17.150
It's a great 19th century moment.

00:10:17.150 --> 00:10:22.150
But -- and this, of course, is where it becomes complicated --

00:10:22.150 --> 00:10:24.150
the facts were true,

00:10:24.150 --> 00:10:27.150
hurrah for archeology,

00:10:27.150 --> 00:10:30.150
but the interpretation was rather more complicated.

00:10:30.150 --> 00:10:33.150
Because the cylinder account and the Hebrew Bible account

00:10:33.150 --> 00:10:35.150
differ in one key respect.

00:10:35.150 --> 00:10:37.150
The Babylonian cylinder

00:10:37.150 --> 00:10:39.150
is written by the priests

00:10:39.150 --> 00:10:41.150
of the great god of Bablyon, Marduk.

00:10:41.150 --> 00:10:43.150
And, not surprisingly,

00:10:43.150 --> 00:10:45.150
they tell you that all this was done by Marduk.

00:10:45.150 --> 00:10:48.150
"Marduk, we hold, called Cyrus by his name."

00:10:48.150 --> 00:10:51.150
Marduk takes Cyrus by the hand,

00:10:51.150 --> 00:10:53.150
calls him to shepherd his people

00:10:53.150 --> 00:10:56.150
and gives him the rule of Babylon.

00:10:56.150 --> 00:10:58.150
Marduk tells Cyrus

00:10:58.150 --> 00:11:00.150
that he will do these great, generous things

00:11:00.150 --> 00:11:02.150
of setting the people free.

00:11:02.150 --> 00:11:04.150
And this is why we should all be grateful to

00:11:04.150 --> 00:11:06.150
and worship Marduk.

00:11:06.150 --> 00:11:08.150
The Hebrew writers

00:11:08.150 --> 00:11:10.150
in the Old Testament,

00:11:10.150 --> 00:11:13.150
you will not be surprised to learn,

00:11:13.150 --> 00:11:15.150
take a rather different view of this.

00:11:15.150 --> 00:11:17.150
For them, of course, it can't possibly by Marduk

00:11:17.150 --> 00:11:19.150
that made all this happen.

00:11:19.150 --> 00:11:21.150
It can only be Jehovah.

00:11:21.150 --> 00:11:23.150
And so in Isaiah,

00:11:23.150 --> 00:11:25.150
we have the wonderful texts

00:11:25.150 --> 00:11:27.150
giving all the credit of this,

00:11:27.150 --> 00:11:28.150
not to Marduk

00:11:28.150 --> 00:11:31.150
but to the Lord God of Israel --

00:11:31.150 --> 00:11:33.150
the Lord God of Israel

00:11:33.150 --> 00:11:35.150
who also called Cyrus by name,

00:11:35.150 --> 00:11:38.150
also takes Cyrus by the hand

00:11:38.150 --> 00:11:40.150
and talks of him shepherding his people.

00:11:40.150 --> 00:11:42.150
It's a remarkable example

00:11:42.150 --> 00:11:46.150
of two different priestly appropriations of the same event,

00:11:46.150 --> 00:11:48.150
two different religious takeovers

00:11:48.150 --> 00:11:50.150
of a political fact.

00:11:50.150 --> 00:11:52.150
God, we know,

00:11:52.150 --> 00:11:54.150
is usually on the side of the big battalions.

00:11:54.150 --> 00:11:57.150
The question is, which god was it?

00:11:57.150 --> 00:11:59.150
And the debate unsettles

00:11:59.150 --> 00:12:01.150
everybody in the 19th century

00:12:01.150 --> 00:12:03.150
to realize that the Hebrew scriptures

00:12:03.150 --> 00:12:06.150
are part of a much wider world of religion.

00:12:06.150 --> 00:12:08.150
And it's quite clear

00:12:08.150 --> 00:12:11.150
the cylinder is older than the text of Isaiah,

00:12:11.150 --> 00:12:13.150
and yet, Jehovah is speaking

00:12:13.150 --> 00:12:15.150
in words very similar

00:12:15.150 --> 00:12:17.150
to those used by Marduk.

00:12:17.150 --> 00:12:20.150
And there's a slight sense that Isaiah knows this,

00:12:20.150 --> 00:12:22.150
because he says,

00:12:22.150 --> 00:12:25.150
this is God speaking, of course,

00:12:25.150 --> 00:12:27.150
"I have called thee by thy name

00:12:27.150 --> 00:12:29.150
though thou hast not known me."

00:12:29.150 --> 00:12:31.150
I think it's recognized

00:12:31.150 --> 00:12:33.150
that Cyrus doesn't realize

00:12:33.150 --> 00:12:36.150
that he's acting under orders from Jehovah.

00:12:36.150 --> 00:12:39.150
And equally, he'd have been surprised that he was acting under orders from Marduk.

00:12:39.150 --> 00:12:41.150
Because interestingly, of course,

00:12:41.150 --> 00:12:43.150
Cyrus is a good Iranian

00:12:43.150 --> 00:12:45.150
with a totally different set of gods

00:12:45.150 --> 00:12:47.150
who are not mentioned in any of these texts.

00:12:47.150 --> 00:12:49.150
(Laughter)

00:12:49.150 --> 00:12:51.150
That's 1879.

00:12:51.150 --> 00:12:53.150
40 years on

00:12:53.150 --> 00:12:56.150
and we're in 1917,

00:12:56.150 --> 00:12:58.150
and the cylinder enters a different world.

00:12:58.150 --> 00:13:00.150
This time, the real politics

00:13:00.150 --> 00:13:02.150
of the contemporary world --

00:13:02.150 --> 00:13:05.150
the year of the Balfour Declaration,

00:13:05.150 --> 00:13:08.150
the year when the new imperial power in the Middle East, Britain,

00:13:08.150 --> 00:13:10.150
decides that it will declare

00:13:10.150 --> 00:13:12.150
a Jewish national home,

00:13:12.150 --> 00:13:14.150
it will allow

00:13:14.150 --> 00:13:16.150
the Jews to return.

00:13:16.150 --> 00:13:18.150
And the response to this

00:13:18.150 --> 00:13:21.150
by the Jewish population in Eastern Europe is rhapsodic.

00:13:21.150 --> 00:13:23.150
And across Eastern Europe,

00:13:23.150 --> 00:13:25.150
Jews display pictures of Cyrus

00:13:25.150 --> 00:13:27.150
and of George V

00:13:27.150 --> 00:13:29.150
side by side --

00:13:29.150 --> 00:13:31.150
the two great rulers

00:13:31.150 --> 00:13:34.150
who have allowed the return to Jerusalem.

00:13:34.150 --> 00:13:37.150
And the Cyrus cylinder comes back into public view

00:13:37.150 --> 00:13:39.150
and the text of this

00:13:39.150 --> 00:13:42.150
as a demonstration of why what is going to happen

00:13:42.150 --> 00:13:45.150
after the war is over in 1918

00:13:45.150 --> 00:13:48.150
is part of a divine plan.

00:13:48.150 --> 00:13:50.150
You all know what happened.

00:13:50.150 --> 00:13:53.150
The state of Israel is setup,

00:13:53.150 --> 00:13:56.150
and 50 years later, in the late 60s,

00:13:56.150 --> 00:13:59.150
it's clear that Britain's role as the imperial power is over.

00:13:59.150 --> 00:14:02.150
And another story of the cylinder begins.

00:14:02.150 --> 00:14:04.150
The region, the U.K. and the U.S. decide,

00:14:04.150 --> 00:14:07.150
has to be kept safe from communism,

00:14:07.150 --> 00:14:10.150
and the superpower that will be created to do this

00:14:10.150 --> 00:14:12.150
would be Iran, the Shah.

00:14:12.150 --> 00:14:15.150
And so the Shah invents an Iranian history,

00:14:15.150 --> 00:14:17.150
or a return to Iranian history,

00:14:17.150 --> 00:14:20.150
that puts him in the center of a great tradition

00:14:20.150 --> 00:14:22.150
and produces coins

00:14:22.150 --> 00:14:24.150
showing himself

00:14:24.150 --> 00:14:26.150
with the Cyrus cylinder.

00:14:26.150 --> 00:14:29.150
When he has his great celebrations in Persepolis,

00:14:29.150 --> 00:14:31.150
he summons the cylinder

00:14:31.150 --> 00:14:34.150
and the cylinder is lent by the British Museum, goes to Tehran,

00:14:34.150 --> 00:14:36.150
and is part of those great celebrations

00:14:36.150 --> 00:14:39.150
of the Pahlavi dynasty.

00:14:39.150 --> 00:14:42.150
Cyrus cylinder: guarantor of the Shah.

00:14:42.150 --> 00:14:45.150
10 years later, another story:

00:14:45.150 --> 00:14:47.150
Iranian Revolution, 1979.

00:14:47.150 --> 00:14:49.150
Islamic revolution, no more Cyrus;

00:14:49.150 --> 00:14:51.150
we're not interested in that history,

00:14:51.150 --> 00:14:54.150
we're interested in Islamic Iran --

00:14:54.150 --> 00:14:56.150
until Iraq,

00:14:56.150 --> 00:14:59.150
the new superpower that we've all decided should be in the region,

00:14:59.150 --> 00:15:01.150
attacks.

00:15:01.150 --> 00:15:03.150
Then another Iran-Iraq war.

00:15:03.150 --> 00:15:05.150
And it becomes critical for the Iranians

00:15:05.150 --> 00:15:08.150
to remember their great past,

00:15:08.150 --> 00:15:10.150
their great past

00:15:10.150 --> 00:15:13.150
when they fought Iraq and won.

00:15:13.150 --> 00:15:15.150
It becomes critical to find a symbol

00:15:15.150 --> 00:15:18.150
that will pull together all Iranians --

00:15:18.150 --> 00:15:20.150
Muslims and non-Muslims,

00:15:20.150 --> 00:15:23.150
Christians, Zoroastrians, Jews living in Iran,

00:15:23.150 --> 00:15:25.150
people who are devout, not devout.

00:15:25.150 --> 00:15:28.150
And the obvious emblem is Cyrus.

00:15:28.150 --> 00:15:31.150
So when the British Museum and Tehran National Musuem

00:15:31.150 --> 00:15:33.150
cooperate and work together, as we've been doing,

00:15:33.150 --> 00:15:35.150
the Iranians ask for one thing only

00:15:35.150 --> 00:15:37.150
as a loan.

00:15:37.150 --> 00:15:39.150
It's the only object they want.

00:15:39.150 --> 00:15:41.150
They want to borrow the Cyrus cylinder.

00:15:41.150 --> 00:15:43.150
And last year,

00:15:43.150 --> 00:15:47.150
the Cyrus cylinder went to Tehran

00:15:47.150 --> 00:15:50.150
for the second time.

00:15:50.150 --> 00:15:53.150
It's shown being presented here, put into its case

00:15:53.150 --> 00:15:56.150
by the director of the National Museum of Tehran,

00:15:56.150 --> 00:15:59.150
one of the many women in Iran in very senior positions,

00:15:59.150 --> 00:16:01.150
Mrs. Ardakani.

00:16:01.150 --> 00:16:03.150
It was a huge event.

00:16:03.150 --> 00:16:06.150
This is the other side of that same picture.

00:16:06.150 --> 00:16:09.150
It's seen in Tehran

00:16:09.150 --> 00:16:11.150
by between one and two million people

00:16:11.150 --> 00:16:13.150
in the space of a few months.

00:16:13.150 --> 00:16:15.150
This is beyond any blockbuster exhibition

00:16:15.150 --> 00:16:17.150
in the West.

00:16:17.150 --> 00:16:20.150
And it's the subject of a huge debate

00:16:20.150 --> 00:16:23.150
about what this cylinder means, what Cyrus means,

00:16:23.150 --> 00:16:26.150
but above all, Cyrus as articulated through this cylinder --

00:16:26.150 --> 00:16:29.150
Cyrus as the defender of the homeland,

00:16:29.150 --> 00:16:31.150
the champion, of course, of Iranian identity

00:16:31.150 --> 00:16:33.150
and of the Iranian peoples,

00:16:33.150 --> 00:16:35.150
tolerant of all faiths.

00:16:35.150 --> 00:16:37.150
And in the current Iran,

00:16:37.150 --> 00:16:40.150
Zoroastrians and Christians have guaranteed places

00:16:40.150 --> 00:16:43.150
in the Iranian parliament, something to be very, very proud of.

00:16:43.150 --> 00:16:46.150
To see this object in Tehran,

00:16:46.150 --> 00:16:48.150
thousands of Jews living in Iran

00:16:48.150 --> 00:16:50.150
came to Tehran to see it.

00:16:50.150 --> 00:16:52.150
It became a great emblem,

00:16:52.150 --> 00:16:54.150
a great subject of debate

00:16:54.150 --> 00:16:57.150
about what Iran is at home and abroad.

00:16:57.150 --> 00:17:00.150
Is Iran still to be the defender of the oppressed?

00:17:00.150 --> 00:17:02.150
Will Iran set free the people

00:17:02.150 --> 00:17:05.150
that the tyrants have enslaved and expropriated?

00:17:05.150 --> 00:17:08.150
This is heady national rhetoric,

00:17:08.150 --> 00:17:10.150
and it was all put together

00:17:10.150 --> 00:17:12.150
in a great pageant

00:17:12.150 --> 00:17:14.150
launching the return.

00:17:14.150 --> 00:17:17.150
Here you see this out-sized Cyrus cylinder on the stage

00:17:17.150 --> 00:17:20.150
with great figures from Iranian history

00:17:20.150 --> 00:17:22.150
gathering to take their place

00:17:22.150 --> 00:17:25.150
in the heritage of Iran.

00:17:25.150 --> 00:17:27.150
It was a narrative presented

00:17:27.150 --> 00:17:30.150
by the president himself.

00:17:30.150 --> 00:17:32.150
And for me,

00:17:32.150 --> 00:17:34.150
to take this object to Iran,

00:17:34.150 --> 00:17:36.150
to be allowed to take this object to Iran

00:17:36.150 --> 00:17:38.150
was to be allowed to be part

00:17:38.150 --> 00:17:40.150
of an extraordinary debate

00:17:40.150 --> 00:17:42.150
led at the highest levels

00:17:42.150 --> 00:17:44.150
about what Iran is,

00:17:44.150 --> 00:17:47.150
what different Irans there are

00:17:47.150 --> 00:17:49.150
and how the different histories of Iran

00:17:49.150 --> 00:17:52.150
might shape the world today.

00:17:52.150 --> 00:17:55.150
It's a debate that's still continuing,

00:17:55.150 --> 00:17:57.150
and it will continue to rumble,

00:17:57.150 --> 00:17:59.150
because this object

00:17:59.150 --> 00:18:01.150
is one of the great declarations

00:18:01.150 --> 00:18:03.150
of a human aspiration.

00:18:03.150 --> 00:18:07.150
It stands with the American constitution.

00:18:07.150 --> 00:18:10.150
It certainly says far more about real freedoms

00:18:10.150 --> 00:18:12.150
than Magna Carta.

00:18:12.150 --> 00:18:15.150
It is a document that can mean so many things,

00:18:15.150 --> 00:18:18.150
for Iran and for the region.

00:18:18.150 --> 00:18:20.150
A replica of this

00:18:20.150 --> 00:18:22.150
is at the United Nations.

00:18:22.150 --> 00:18:25.150
In New York this autumn, it will be present

00:18:25.150 --> 00:18:27.150
when the great debates

00:18:27.150 --> 00:18:30.150
about the future of the Middle East take place.

00:18:30.150 --> 00:18:32.150
And I want to finish by asking you

00:18:32.150 --> 00:18:34.150
what the next story will be

00:18:34.150 --> 00:18:36.150
in which this object figures.

00:18:36.150 --> 00:18:38.150
It will appear, certainly,

00:18:38.150 --> 00:18:40.150
in many more Middle Eastern stories.

00:18:40.150 --> 00:18:42.150
And what story of the Middle East,

00:18:42.150 --> 00:18:44.150
what story of the world,

00:18:44.150 --> 00:18:46.150
do you want to see

00:18:46.150 --> 00:18:48.150
reflecting what is said,

00:18:48.150 --> 00:18:50.150
what is expressed in this cylinder?

00:18:50.150 --> 00:18:52.150
The right of peoples

00:18:52.150 --> 00:18:54.150
to live together in the same state,

00:18:54.150 --> 00:18:56.150
worshiping differently, freely --

00:18:56.150 --> 00:18:58.150
a Middle East, a world,

00:18:58.150 --> 00:19:00.150
in which religion is not the subject of division

00:19:00.150 --> 00:19:03.150
or of debate.

00:19:03.150 --> 00:19:06.150
In the world of the Middle East at the moment,

00:19:06.150 --> 00:19:09.150
the debates are, as you know, shrill.

00:19:09.150 --> 00:19:11.150
But I think it's possible

00:19:11.150 --> 00:19:15.150
that the most powerful and the wisest voice of all of them

00:19:15.150 --> 00:19:17.150
may well be the voice

00:19:17.150 --> 00:19:19.150
of this mute thing,

00:19:19.150 --> 00:19:21.150
the Cyrus cylinder.

00:19:21.150 --> 00:19:23.150
Thank you.

00:19:23.150 --> 00:19:27.150
(Applause)
