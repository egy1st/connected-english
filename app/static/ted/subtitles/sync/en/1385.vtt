00:00:26.102 --> 00:00:27.961
When you think about the brain,

00:00:27.985 --> 00:00:29.779
it's difficult to understand,

00:00:29.803 --> 00:00:33.041
because if I were to ask you right now,
how does the heart work,

00:00:33.065 --> 00:00:35.207
you would instantly tell me it's a pump.

00:00:35.231 --> 00:00:36.649
It pumps blood.

00:00:36.673 --> 00:00:38.349
If I were to ask about your lungs,

00:00:38.373 --> 00:00:40.949
you would say it exchanges
oxygen for carbon dioxide.

00:00:40.973 --> 00:00:41.987
That's easy.

00:00:42.011 --> 00:00:45.076
If I were to ask you how the brain works,
it's hard to understand

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:48.153
because you can't just look
at a brain and understand what it is.

00:00:48.177 --> 00:00:50.981
It's not a mechanical object,
not a pump, not an airbag.

00:00:51.005 --> 00:00:53.868
It's just like, if you held it
in your hand when it was dead,

00:00:53.892 --> 00:00:55.097
it's just a piece of fat.

00:00:56.035 --> 00:00:59.424
To understand how the brain works,
you have to go inside a living brain.

00:00:59.448 --> 00:01:03.126
Because the brain's not mechanical,
the brain is electrical and it's chemical.

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:05.963
Your brain is made out of
100 billion cells, called neurons.

00:01:05.987 --> 00:01:09.864
And these neurons communicate
with each other with electricity.

00:01:09.888 --> 00:01:13.126
And we're going to eavesdrop
in on a conversation between two cells,

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:16.008
and we're going to listen
to something called a spike.

00:01:16.032 --> 00:01:19.925
But we're not going to record my brain
or your brain or your teachers' brains,

00:01:19.949 --> 00:01:22.244
we're going to use our good
friend the cockroach.

00:01:22.268 --> 00:01:24.126
Not just because I think they're cool,

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.528
but because they have brains
very similar to ours.

00:01:26.552 --> 00:01:29.220
So if you learn a little bit
about how their brains work,

00:01:29.244 --> 00:01:31.722
we're going to learn a lot
about how our brains work.

00:01:31.746 --> 00:01:33.825
I'm going to put them
in some ice water here

00:01:34.762 --> 00:01:35.835
And then --

00:01:36.364 --> 00:01:38.769
Audience: Ew!
Greg Gabe: Yeah ...

00:01:38.793 --> 00:01:40.769
Right now they're becoming anesthetized.

00:01:40.793 --> 00:01:44.095
Because they're cold blooded,
they become the temperature of the water

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:47.245
and they can't control it
so they just basically "chillax," right?

00:01:47.269 --> 00:01:49.126
They're not going to feel anything,

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:51.925
which may tell you a little
about what we're going to do,

00:01:51.949 --> 00:01:54.579
a scientific experiment
to understand the brain.

00:01:54.603 --> 00:01:55.624
So ...

00:01:56.616 --> 00:01:58.126
This is the leg of a cockroach.

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:00.293
And a cockroach
has all these beautiful hairs

00:02:00.317 --> 00:02:02.126
and pricklies all over it.

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:05.126
Underneath each one of those is a cell,

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:08.126
and this cell's a neuron
that is going to send information

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:09.589
about wind or vibration.

00:02:09.613 --> 00:02:13.459
If you ever try to catch a cockroach,
it's hard because they can feel you coming

00:02:13.483 --> 00:02:15.642
before you're even there,
they start running.

00:02:15.666 --> 00:02:18.435
These cells are zipping up
this information up to the brain

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:21.242
using those little axons
with electronic messages in there.

00:02:21.266 --> 00:02:23.848
We're going to record
by sticking a pin right in there.

00:02:23.872 --> 00:02:26.519
We need to take off the leg
of a cockroach --

00:02:26.543 --> 00:02:28.126
don't worry, they'll grow back --

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:30.467
then we're going to put two pins in there.

00:02:30.491 --> 00:02:31.515
These are metal pins.

00:02:31.539 --> 00:02:35.170
One will pick up this electronic message,
this electric message is going by.

00:02:35.194 --> 00:02:38.674
So, we're now going to do the surgery,
let's see if you guys can see this.

00:02:40.785 --> 00:02:42.188
Yeah, it's gross ...

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:47.030
All right. So there we go.

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:49.823
You guys can see his leg right there.

00:02:49.847 --> 00:02:51.347
Now I'm going to take this leg,

00:02:51.371 --> 00:02:54.087
I'm going to put it in this invention
that we came up with

00:02:54.111 --> 00:02:55.229
called the Spikerbox --

00:02:55.253 --> 00:02:58.759
and this replaces lots of expensive
equipment in a research lab,

00:02:58.783 --> 00:03:01.959
so you guys can do this
in your own high schools,

00:03:01.983 --> 00:03:04.237
or in your own basements if it's me.

00:03:05.568 --> 00:03:06.901
(Audience: Laughter)

00:03:07.702 --> 00:03:09.425
So, there.

00:03:12.123 --> 00:03:13.484
Can you guys see that?

00:03:13.508 --> 00:03:16.260
Alright, so I'm going to go ahead
and turn this on.

00:03:18.983 --> 00:03:20.126
I'm going to plug it in.

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:21.151
(Tuning sound)

00:03:21.175 --> 00:03:23.738
To me, this is the most beautiful
sound in the world.

00:03:23.762 --> 00:03:25.770
This is what your brain
is doing right now.

00:03:25.794 --> 00:03:28.726
You have 100 billion cells
making these raindrop-type noises.

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:30.735
Let's take a look at what it looks like,

00:03:30.759 --> 00:03:32.558
let's pull it up on the iPad screen.

00:03:32.582 --> 00:03:34.311
I plugged my iPad into here as well.

00:03:34.335 --> 00:03:36.579
So remember we said
the axon looks like a spike.

00:03:36.603 --> 00:03:38.020
So we're going to take a look

00:03:38.044 --> 00:03:40.686
at what one of them
looks like in just a brief second.

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:41.936
We're going to tap here,

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:43.665
so we can sort of average this guy.

00:03:43.689 --> 00:03:46.126
So there we see it.
That's an action potential.

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:49.198
You've got 100 billion cells
in your brain doing this right now,

00:03:49.222 --> 00:03:52.466
sending all this information back
about what you're seeing, hearing.

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:53.791
We also said this is a cell

00:03:53.815 --> 00:03:57.126
that's going to be taking up information
about vibrations in the wind.

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:58.865
So what if we do an experiment?

00:03:58.889 --> 00:04:01.596
We can actually blow on this
and hear if we see a change.

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:03.102
Are you guys going to be ready?

00:04:03.126 --> 00:04:05.421
If I blow on it you tell me
if you hear anything.

00:04:05.445 --> 00:04:06.513
(Blowing)

00:04:07.157 --> 00:04:08.633
(Sound changes)

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:11.563
Let me just touch this
with a little pen here.

00:04:11.587 --> 00:04:12.736
(Noise)

00:04:14.911 --> 00:04:16.483
That was the neural firing rate.

00:04:16.507 --> 00:04:19.484
That actually took a while
in neuroscience to understand this.

00:04:19.508 --> 00:04:20.801
This is called rate coding:

00:04:20.825 --> 00:04:23.792
the harder you press on something,
the more spikes there are,

00:04:23.816 --> 00:04:26.247
and all that information
is coming up to your brain.

00:04:26.271 --> 00:04:27.753
That's how you perceive things.

00:04:27.777 --> 00:04:30.499
So that's one way of doing
an experiment with electricity.

00:04:30.523 --> 00:04:35.044
The other way is that your brain is not
only taking in electrical impulses,

00:04:35.068 --> 00:04:36.221
you're also sending out.

00:04:36.245 --> 00:04:38.194
That's how you move your muscles around.

00:04:38.218 --> 00:04:41.378
Let's see what happens if I've plugged in
something that's electric

00:04:41.402 --> 00:04:43.126
into the cockroach leg here.

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:46.894
I'm going to take two pins,
I'm going to plug them onto the cockroach.

00:04:46.918 --> 00:04:50.410
I'm going to take the other end,
I'm going to plug in into my iPod.

00:04:50.434 --> 00:04:51.887
It's my iPhone actually.

00:04:51.911 --> 00:04:55.022
Do you guys know how your earbuds
work in your ears?

00:04:55.046 --> 00:04:57.353
You have a battery
in your phone, or iPod, right?

00:04:57.377 --> 00:05:00.480
It's sending electrical current
into these magnets in your earbuds

00:05:00.504 --> 00:05:03.126
which shake back and forth
and allow you to hear things.

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:06.126
But that current's the same currency
that our brain uses,

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:08.106
so we can send that to our cockroach leg

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:09.465
and hopefully if this works,

00:05:09.489 --> 00:05:12.831
we can actually see what happens
when we play music into the cockroach.

00:05:12.855 --> 00:05:13.977
Let's take a look.

00:05:15.673 --> 00:05:18.079
(Music beat)

00:05:18.103 --> 00:05:19.594
Can we turn it up? There we go.

00:05:19.618 --> 00:05:22.126
(Audience reacts and gasps)

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:23.880
GG: So what's happening?

00:05:23.904 --> 00:05:25.150
Audience: Wow!

00:05:25.174 --> 00:05:26.260
(Laughter)

00:05:26.284 --> 00:05:29.126
So you see what's moving.
It's moving on the bass.

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:31.318
All those audiophiles out there,

00:05:31.342 --> 00:05:33.469
if you have awesome, kicking car stereos,

00:05:33.493 --> 00:05:36.087
you know, the bass speakers
are the biggest speakers.

00:05:36.111 --> 00:05:38.197
The biggest speakers
have the longest waves,

00:05:38.221 --> 00:05:39.562
which have the most current,

00:05:39.586 --> 00:05:42.173
and the current is what's causing
these things to move.

00:05:42.197 --> 00:05:45.826
So it's not just speakers
that are causing electricity.

00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:47.740
Microphones also cause electricity.

00:05:47.764 --> 00:05:48.836
(Beat)

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:52.533
So I'm going to go ahead and invite
another person out on the stage here

00:05:52.557 --> 00:05:53.765
to help me out with this.

00:05:53.789 --> 00:05:54.913
So there we go.

00:05:54.937 --> 00:05:57.056
(Beatboxing)

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:02.579
This is the first time this has ever
happened in the history of mankind.

00:06:02.603 --> 00:06:05.126
Human beatbox to a cockroach leg.

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:08.624
When you guys go back to your high school,
think about neuroscience

00:06:08.648 --> 00:06:11.126
and how you guys can begin
the neuro-revolution.

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:12.851
Thank you very much. Bye bye.

00:06:12.875 --> 00:06:13.875
(Applause)
