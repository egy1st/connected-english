00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:14.150
So my name is Taylor Wilson.

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:16.150
I am 17 years old

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:18.150
and I am a nuclear physicist,

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.150
which may be a little hard to believe, but I am.

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.150
And I would like to make the case

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.150
that nuclear fusion

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:28.150
will be that point,

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:30.150
that the bridge that T. Boone Pickens talked about

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.150
will get us to.

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:35.150
So nuclear fusion is our energy future.

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:37.150
And the second point,

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:39.150
making the case that kids can really change the world.

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:41.150
So you may ask --

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:45.150
(Applause)

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:47.150
You may ask me,

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:49.150
well how do you know what our energy future is?

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:51.150
Well I built a fusion reactor

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:53.150
when I was 14 years old.

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:56.150
That is the inside of my nuclear fusion reactor.

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:58.150
I started building this project

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:01.150
when I was about 12 or 13 years old.

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:03.150
I decided I wanted to make a star.

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:05.150
Now most of you are probably saying,

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:08.150
well there's no such thing as nuclear fusion.

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:11.150
I don't see any nuclear power plants with fusion energy.

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:13.150
Well it doesn't break even.

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:15.150
It doesn't produce more energy out than I put in,

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:18.150
but it still does some pretty cool stuff.

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.150
And I assembled this in my garage,

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:22.150
and it now lives in the physics department

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:24.150
of the University of Nevada, Reno.

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.150
And it slams together deuterium,

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:29.150
which is just hydrogen with an extra neutron in it.

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:32.150
So this is similar to the reaction

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:34.150
of the proton chain that's going on inside the Sun.

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:37.150
And I'm slamming it together so hard

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:39.150
that that hydrogen fuses together,

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.150
and in the process it has some byproducts,

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:44.150
and I utilize those byproducts.

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:47.150
So this previous year,

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:51.150
I won the Intel International Science and Engineering Fair.

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:53.150
I developed a detector that replaces the current detectors

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:55.150
that Homeland Security has.

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:57.150
For hundreds of dollars,

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:00.150
I've developed a system that exceeds the sensitivity

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:03.150
of detectors that are hundreds of thousands of dollars.

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:05.150
I built this in my garage.

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:07.150
(Applause)

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:09.150
And I've developed a system

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:11.150
to produce medical isotopes.

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:13.150
Instead of requiring multi-million-dollar facilities

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:16.150
I've developed a device that, on a very small scale,

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:18.150
can produce these isotopes.

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:21.150
So that's my fusion reactor in the background there.

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:25.150
That is me at the control panel

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:27.150
of my fusion reactor.

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:30.150
Oh, by the way, I make yellowcake in my garage,

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:33.150
so my nuclear program is as advanced as the Iranians.

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:36.150
So maybe I don't want to admit to that.

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:39.150
This is me at CERN in Geneva, Switzerland,

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:43.150
which is the preeminent particle physics laboratory in the world.

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:45.150
And this is me with President Obama,

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:48.150
showing him my Homeland Security research.

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:53.150
(Applause)

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:55.150
So in about seven years

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:57.150
of doing nuclear research,

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:59.150
I started out with a dream

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:01.150
to make a "star in a jar," a star in my garage,

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:03.150
and I ended up meeting the president

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:06.150
and developing things that I think can change the world,

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:08.150
and I think other kids can too.

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:10.150
So thank you very much.

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:23.150
(Applause)
