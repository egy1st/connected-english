00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:14.150
This may sound strange,

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:16.150
but I'm a big fan of the concrete block.

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:19.150
The first concrete blocks were manufactured in 1868

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:21.150
with a very simple idea:

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.150
modules made of cement of a fixed measurement

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.150
that fit together.

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:28.150
Very quickly concrete blocks became

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:31.150
the most-used construction unit in the world.

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:33.150
They enabled us to to build things that were larger than us,

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:35.150
buildings, bridges,

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:37.150
one brick at a time.

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:39.150
Essentially concrete blocks had become

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:42.150
the building block of our time.

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:44.150
Almost a hundred years later in 1947,

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:46.150
LEGO came up with this.

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:49.150
It was called the Automatic Binding Brick.

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:51.150
And in a few short years,

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:54.150
LEGO bricks took place in every household.

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:57.150
It's estimated that over 400 billion bricks have been produced --

00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:00.150
or 75 bricks for every person on the planet.

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:02.150
You don't have to be an engineer

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:05.150
to make beautiful houses, beautiful bridges, beautiful buildings.

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:07.150
LEGO made it accessible.

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:10.150
LEGO has essentially taken the concrete block, the building block of the world,

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:12.150
and made it into the building block

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.150
of our imagination.

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:16.150
Meanwhile the exact same year,

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:19.150
at Bell Labs the next revolution was about to be announced,

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:21.150
the next building block.

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.150
The transistor was a small plastic unit

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:25.150
that would take us from a world

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:27.150
of static bricks piled on top of each other

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.150
to a world where everything was interactive.

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:31.150
Like the concrete block,

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:33.150
the transistor allows you to build

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:36.150
much larger, more complex circuits, one brick at a time.

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.150
But there's a main difference:

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:40.150
The transistor was only for experts.

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:42.150
I personally don't accept this,

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.150
that the building block of our time

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:46.150
is reserved for experts,

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:49.150
so I decided to change that.

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:51.150
Eight years ago when I was at the Media Lab,

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:53.150
I started exploring this idea

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:55.150
of how to put the power of engineers

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:57.150
in the hands of artists and designers.

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:00.150
A few years ago I started developing littleBits.

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:03.150
Let me show you how they work.

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:07.150
LittleBits are electronic modules

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:10.150
with each one specific function.

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:12.150
They're pre-engineered

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:15.150
to be light, sound,

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:17.150
motors and sensors.

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:19.150
And the best part about it

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:22.150
is they snap together with magnets.

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:25.150
So you can't put them the wrong way.

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:27.150
The bricks are color-coded.

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:30.150
Green is output, blue is power,

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:32.150
pink is input and orange is wire.

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:35.150
So all you need to do is snap a blue to a green

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:38.150
and very quickly you can start making larger circuits.

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:40.150
You put a blue to a green,

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:42.150
you can make light.

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:46.150
You can put a knob in between

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:49.150
and now you've made a little dimmer.

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:52.150
Switch out the knob

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:54.150
for a pulse module,

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:57.150
which is here,

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:01.150
and now you've made a little blinker.

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:03.150
Add this buzzer

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:05.150
for some extra punch

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:07.150
and you've created a noise machine.

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:09.150
I'm going to stop that.

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:12.150
So beyond simple play,

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:14.150
littleBits are actually pretty powerful.

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:17.150
Instead of having to program, to wire, to solder,

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:19.150
littleBits allow you to program

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:21.150
using very simple intuitive gestures.

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:23.150
So to make this blink faster or slower,

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:25.150
you would just turn this knob

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:28.150
and basically make it pulse faster or slower.

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:30.150
The idea behind littleBits

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:32.150
is that it's a growing library.

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:34.150
We want to make every single interaction in the world

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:36.150
into a ready-to-use brick.

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:38.150
Lights, sounds, solar panels, motors --

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:40.150
everything should be accessible.

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:43.150
We've been giving littleBits to kids and seeing them play with them.

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:45.150
And it's been an incredible experience.

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:47.150
The nicest thing is how they start to understand

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:49.150
the electronics around them from everyday

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:51.150
that they don't learn at schools.

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:53.150
For example, how a nightlight works,

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:55.150
or why an elevator door stays open,

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:58.150
or how an iPod responds to touch.

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:00.150
We've also been taking littleBits to design schools.

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:03.150
So for example, we've had designers

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:05.150
with no experience with electronics whatsoever

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:08.150
start to play with littleBits as a material.

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:11.150
Here you see, with felt and paper water bottles,

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:13.150
we have Geordie making ...

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:15.150
(Clanging)

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:17.150
(Buzzing)

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:20.150
A few weeks ago we took littleBits to RISD

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:22.150
and gave them to some designers

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:24.150
with no experience in engineering whatsoever --

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:27.150
just cardboard, wood and paper -- and told them "Make something."

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:29.150
Here's an example of a project they made,

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:32.150
a motion-activated confetti canon ball.

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:34.150
(Laughter)

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:38.150
But wait, this is actually my favorite project.

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:41.150
It's a lobster made of playdough

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:45.150
that's afraid of the dark.

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:49.150
(Laughter)

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:52.150
To these non-engineers, littleBits became another material,

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:54.150
electronics became just another material.

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:57.150
And we want to make this material accessible to everyone.

00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:59.150
So littleBits is open-source.

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:02.150
You can go on the website, download all the design files, make them yourself.

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:04.150
We want to encourage a world

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:07.150
of creators, of inventors, of contributors,

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:09.150
because this world that we live in,

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:11.150
this interactive world, is ours.

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:13.150
So go ahead and start inventing.

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:15.150
Thank you.

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:18.150
(Applause)
