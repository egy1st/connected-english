00:00:14.055 --> 00:00:16.514
So, without romanticizing this too much:

00:00:16.538 --> 00:00:20.174
imagine that you light your home
with kerosene and candles every night,

00:00:20.198 --> 00:00:21.891
and that you do all of your cooking

00:00:21.915 --> 00:00:23.076
with charcoal.

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.962
This is how the world's
two billion poorest people

00:00:25.986 --> 00:00:28.047
cook and light their homes every day.

00:00:28.071 --> 00:00:30.055
This isn't just inconvenient,

00:00:30.079 --> 00:00:31.733
this is inefficient,

00:00:31.757 --> 00:00:33.017
it's expensive,

00:00:33.041 --> 00:00:35.731
it's harmful to human health,
harmful to the environment,

00:00:35.755 --> 00:00:36.932
and it's unproductive.

00:00:36.956 --> 00:00:38.285
And that's energy poverty.

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:40.215
So let me give you a couple of examples.

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:41.556
I work in Haiti,

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:45.863
where about 80% of the population
lives in energy poverty.

00:00:45.887 --> 00:00:49.693
The average household
spends 10% of its income

00:00:49.717 --> 00:00:51.555
on kerosene for lighting –

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:56.772
that's an order of magnitude greater
than what the average US household spends

00:00:56.796 --> 00:00:59.358
on electricity to light their homes.

00:00:59.382 --> 00:01:01.606
The 2008 hurricane season in Haiti caused

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:03.825
about one billion dollars in damage.

00:01:03.849 --> 00:01:06.207
That was a sixth of their GDP.

00:01:06.231 --> 00:01:07.543
The damage was so severe

00:01:07.567 --> 00:01:11.076
because the primary energy fuel
in Haiti is charcoal,

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:12.468
which is made from trees,

00:01:12.492 --> 00:01:15.242
and has left the country
almost completely deforested.

00:01:15.266 --> 00:01:19.999
Without trees, the country can't absorb
heavy rains and massive flooding,

00:01:20.023 --> 00:01:21.360
as a result.

00:01:21.384 --> 00:01:22.950
So in the industrialized world,

00:01:22.974 --> 00:01:26.879
we built walls that protect us
from the externalities of our energy use;

00:01:26.903 --> 00:01:30.616
we can afford to clean up acute
environmental disasters;

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:33.932
and we can also afford
to adapt to chronic conditions

00:01:33.956 --> 00:01:35.556
like climate change.

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:38.245
That's not the case for Haiti.
They can't afford this.

00:01:38.269 --> 00:01:41.445
The only way they're going to lift
themselves out of energy poverty

00:01:41.469 --> 00:01:44.154
is by adapting fuels
that are more efficient,

00:01:44.178 --> 00:01:45.678
that are less expensive,

00:01:45.702 --> 00:01:48.688
that are better for human health,
better for the environment

00:01:48.712 --> 00:01:50.171
and that are more productive.

00:01:50.195 --> 00:01:52.881
So it turns out that those fuels
and technologies exist,

00:01:52.905 --> 00:01:54.484
and this is an example of that.

00:01:54.508 --> 00:01:57.311
This is a solar LED lightbulb

00:01:57.335 --> 00:02:02.292
that we sell for a retail price
of about 10 dollars in rural Haiti.

00:02:02.806 --> 00:02:05.273
That's a payback period
of less than three months

00:02:05.297 --> 00:02:07.083
for the average Haitian household.

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:13.455
The prescriptions to solve energy poverty
seems pretty straightforward:

00:02:13.479 --> 00:02:16.864
you develop these technologies
that have a great return on investment,

00:02:16.888 --> 00:02:18.801
and people should be snatching them up.

00:02:18.825 --> 00:02:20.182
But that's not the case.

00:02:20.206 --> 00:02:23.404
The first time I ever went down to Haiti
was in August of 2008,

00:02:23.428 --> 00:02:24.641
sort of on a whim,

00:02:24.665 --> 00:02:27.547
and I was fielding surveys
in the rural south of the country

00:02:27.571 --> 00:02:29.974
to assess the extent of energy poverty.

00:02:29.998 --> 00:02:32.336
And at night, I would go around sometimes

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:34.547
and I would speak with the street vendors

00:02:34.571 --> 00:02:37.833
and see if they were interested
in buying these solar LED lamps.

00:02:37.857 --> 00:02:40.701
One woman who I encountered
turned down my offer,

00:02:40.725 --> 00:02:43.216
and she said, “Mon chéri,
c'est trop Cher,”

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:45.928
which basically means,
“My dear, it's too expensive.”

00:02:45.952 --> 00:02:47.417
But I tried to explain to her,

00:02:47.441 --> 00:02:49.711
“Look, this is going to save you
a lot of money,

00:02:49.735 --> 00:02:51.806
and it's going to give
you even better light

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:54.170
than what you're using
now with the kerosene.”

00:02:54.194 --> 00:02:55.536
So I didn't make the sale,

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:58.027
but I did learn a really important lesson,

00:02:58.051 --> 00:03:00.059
which is that technology, products,

00:03:00.083 --> 00:03:02.640
were not going to end energy poverty.

00:03:02.664 --> 00:03:04.848
Instead, access was going to.

00:03:04.872 --> 00:03:07.389
Specifically, there are
two types of access

00:03:07.413 --> 00:03:09.417
that are going to end energy poverty:

00:03:09.441 --> 00:03:12.701
there's physical access,
and there's financial access.

00:03:13.057 --> 00:03:14.446
So, physical access --

00:03:14.979 --> 00:03:16.532
what does that mean?

00:03:16.556 --> 00:03:20.791
It's very expensive for low-income
households in developing countries

00:03:20.815 --> 00:03:22.621
to reach major centers of commerce.

00:03:22.645 --> 00:03:26.573
And it's basically impossible for them
to order something off Amazon.com.

00:03:26.597 --> 00:03:29.363
“The last mile” is a phrase
that's normally associated

00:03:29.387 --> 00:03:31.212
with the telecommunications industry.

00:03:31.236 --> 00:03:33.476
It means that last bit
of wire that's necessary

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:35.694
to connect the customer to the provider.

00:03:35.718 --> 00:03:41.349
What we need for ending energy poverty
are last-mile retailers

00:03:41.373 --> 00:03:44.381
that bring these clean energy
products to the people.

00:03:44.405 --> 00:03:47.541
The kerosene and charcoal value chains
already figured this out:

00:03:47.565 --> 00:03:51.035
those fuels are ubiquitous
across the entire country.

00:03:51.059 --> 00:03:53.504
You can go to the most remote
village in Haiti

00:03:53.528 --> 00:03:56.913
and you will find somebody
selling kerosene and charcoal.

00:03:56.937 --> 00:03:59.376
So the other type of access: financial.

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:03.262
We all know that clean energy
products, technologies,

00:04:03.286 --> 00:04:05.845
tend to be characterized
by higher upfront costs,

00:04:05.869 --> 00:04:07.477
but very low operating costs.

00:04:07.501 --> 00:04:09.301
And so in the industrialized world,

00:04:09.325 --> 00:04:12.347
we have very generous subsidies
that are specifically designed

00:04:12.371 --> 00:04:14.939
to bring down those upfront costs.

00:04:14.963 --> 00:04:17.038
Those subsidies don't exist in Haiti.

00:04:17.062 --> 00:04:19.546
What they do have is microfinance.

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:22.394
But you're going to severely diminish
the value proposition

00:04:22.418 --> 00:04:23.828
of your clean energy product

00:04:23.852 --> 00:04:27.277
if you expect somebody in Haiti
to go out, get a microloan,

00:04:27.301 --> 00:04:28.706
go back to the retailer,

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:30.909
and then buy the clean energy product.

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:35.538
So the prescription to end energy poverty
is much more complicated

00:04:35.562 --> 00:04:37.572
than simply products.

00:04:37.596 --> 00:04:40.319
We need to integrate financial access

00:04:40.343 --> 00:04:44.148
directly into new, innovative
distribution models.

00:04:44.473 --> 00:04:45.638
What does that mean?

00:04:45.662 --> 00:04:48.870
That means bundling consumer credit
with the retailer.

00:04:48.894 --> 00:04:51.644
This is really easy
for Bloomingdale’s to do,

00:04:51.668 --> 00:04:55.634
but it's not so easy for a rural
sales agent in Haiti to do.

00:04:55.658 --> 00:04:58.337
We need to redirect cash flows

00:04:58.361 --> 00:05:01.345
that are going now
from the diaspora in the United States

00:05:01.369 --> 00:05:04.635
through Western Union
wire transfers in cash

00:05:04.659 --> 00:05:06.513
directly into clean energy products

00:05:06.537 --> 00:05:10.373
that can be delivered to or picked up by
their friends or family in Haiti.

00:05:10.397 --> 00:05:13.483
So the next time you hear
about a technology or product

00:05:13.507 --> 00:05:15.167
that's going to change the world,

00:05:15.191 --> 00:05:16.588
be a little bit skeptical.

00:05:16.612 --> 00:05:20.267
The inventor Dean Kamen,
the guy who invented the Segway,

00:05:20.291 --> 00:05:22.048
a genius by any standards,

00:05:22.072 --> 00:05:27.325
once said that his job is easy,
inventing things is easy,

00:05:27.349 --> 00:05:30.420
the hard part is the technology
dissemination --

00:05:30.444 --> 00:05:32.571
it's getting those
technologies and products

00:05:32.595 --> 00:05:34.158
to the people who need it most.

00:05:34.182 --> 00:05:35.357
Thank you.

00:05:35.381 --> 00:05:38.733
(Applause)
