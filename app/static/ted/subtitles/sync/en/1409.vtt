00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:14.150
Just a moment ago,

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:18.150
my daughter Rebecca texted me for good luck.

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:20.150
Her text said,

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:23.150
"Mom, you will rock."

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:25.150
I love this.

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:27.150
Getting that text

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.150
was like getting a hug.

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:32.150
And so there you have it.

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:34.150
I embody

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:36.150
the central paradox.

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:38.150
I'm a woman

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:40.150
who loves getting texts

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:42.150
who's going to tell you

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:45.150
that too many of them can be a problem.

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:48.150
Actually that reminder of my daughter

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:51.150
brings me to the beginning of my story.

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:55.150
1996, when I gave my first TEDTalk,

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:57.150
Rebecca was five years old

00:00:57.150 --> 00:00:59.150
and she was sitting right there

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:01.150
in the front row.

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:03.150
I had just written a book

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:05.150
that celebrated our life on the internet

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:08.150
and I was about to be on the cover

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:10.150
of Wired magazine.

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:12.150
In those heady days,

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.150
we were experimenting

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:17.150
with chat rooms and online virtual communities.

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:21.150
We were exploring different aspects of ourselves.

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.150
And then we unplugged.

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:25.150
I was excited.

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:28.150
And, as a psychologist, what excited me most

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:30.150
was the idea

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.150
that we would use what we learned in the virtual world

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:36.150
about ourselves, about our identity,

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:39.150
to live better lives in the real world.

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:42.150
Now fast-forward to 2012.

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:45.150
I'm back here on the TED stage again.

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:48.150
My daughter's 20. She's a college student.

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:52.150
She sleeps with her cellphone,

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:54.150
so do I.

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:57.150
And I've just written a new book,

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:00.150
but this time it's not one

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:02.150
that will get me on the cover

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:04.150
of Wired magazine.

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:07.150
So what happened?

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:10.150
I'm still excited by technology,

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:12.150
but I believe,

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:14.150
and I'm here to make the case,

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:16.150
that we're letting it take us places

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:18.150
that we don't want to go.

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:20.150
Over the past 15 years,

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:23.150
I've studied technologies of mobile communication

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:26.150
and I've interviewed hundreds and hundreds of people,

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:28.150
young and old,

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:30.150
about their plugged in lives.

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:32.150
And what I've found

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:34.150
is that our little devices,

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:37.150
those little devices in our pockets,

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:39.150
are so psychologically powerful

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:43.150
that they don't only change what we do,

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:46.150
they change who we are.

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:48.150
Some of the things we do now with our devices

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:51.150
are things that, only a few years ago,

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:53.150
we would have found odd

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:55.150
or disturbing,

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:58.150
but they've quickly come to seem familiar,

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:00.150
just how we do things.

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:03.150
So just to take some quick examples:

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:05.150
People text or do email

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:08.150
during corporate board meetings.

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:11.150
They text and shop and go on Facebook

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:14.150
during classes, during presentations,

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:16.150
actually during all meetings.

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:19.150
People talk to me about the important new skill

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:21.150
of making eye contact

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:23.150
while you're texting.

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:25.150
(Laughter)

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:27.150
People explain to me

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:30.150
that it's hard, but that it can be done.

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:32.150
Parents text and do email

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:34.150
at breakfast and at dinner

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:37.150
while their children complain

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:39.150
about not having their parents' full attention.

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:41.150
But then these same children

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:44.150
deny each other their full attention.

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:46.150
This is a recent shot

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:49.150
of my daughter and her friends

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:51.150
being together

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:54.150
while not being together.

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:56.150
And we even text at funerals.

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:58.150
I study this.

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:00.150
We remove ourselves

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:02.150
from our grief or from our revery

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:05.150
and we go into our phones.

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:07.150
Why does this matter?

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:09.150
It matters to me

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:12.150
because I think we're setting ourselves up for trouble --

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:14.150
trouble certainly

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:16.150
in how we relate to each other,

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:18.150
but also trouble

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:21.150
in how we relate to ourselves

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:24.150
and our capacity for self-reflection.

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:26.150
We're getting used to a new way

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:29.150
of being alone together.

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:31.150
People want to be with each other,

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:33.150
but also elsewhere --

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:36.150
connected to all the different places they want to be.

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:39.150
People want to customize their lives.

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:42.150
They want to go in and out of all the places they are

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:44.150
because the thing that matters most to them

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:48.150
is control over where they put their attention.

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:51.150
So you want to go to that board meeting,

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:53.150
but you only want to pay attention

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:55.150
to the bits that interest you.

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:58.150
And some people think that's a good thing.

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:00.150
But you can end up

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:02.150
hiding from each other,

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:05.150
even as we're all constantly connected to each other.

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:07.150
A 50-year-old business man

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:09.150
lamented to me

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:12.150
that he feels he doesn't have colleagues anymore at work.

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:15.150
When he goes to work, he doesn't stop by to talk to anybody,

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:17.150
he doesn't call.

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:20.150
And he says he doesn't want to interrupt his colleagues

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:23.150
because, he says, "They're too busy on their email."

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:25.150
But then he stops himself

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:27.150
and he says, "You know, I'm not telling you the truth.

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:30.150
I'm the one who doesn't want to be interrupted.

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:32.150
I think I should want to,

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:36.150
but actually I'd rather just do things on my Blackberry."

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:38.150
Across the generations,

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:42.150
I see that people can't get enough of each other,

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:44.150
if and only if

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:47.150
they can have each other at a distance,

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:49.150
in amounts they can control.

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:52.150
I call it the Goldilocks effect:

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:55.150
not too close, not too far,

00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:57.150
just right.

00:05:57.150 --> 00:05:59.150
But what might feel just right

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:01.150
for that middle-aged executive

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:03.150
can be a problem for an adolescent

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:07.150
who needs to develop face-to-face relationships.

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:09.150
An 18-year-old boy

00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:12.150
who uses texting for almost everything

00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:14.150
says to me wistfully,

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:17.150
"Someday, someday,

00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:19.150
but certainly not now,

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:23.150
I'd like to learn how to have a conversation."

00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:25.150
When I ask people

00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:28.150
"What's wrong with having a conversation?"

00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:32.150
People say, "I'll tell you what's wrong with having a conversation.

00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:35.150
It takes place in real time

00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:39.150
and you can't control what you're going to say."

00:06:39.150 --> 00:06:41.150
So that's the bottom line.

00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:44.150
Texting, email, posting,

00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:46.150
all of these things

00:06:46.150 --> 00:06:49.150
let us present the self as we want to be.

00:06:49.150 --> 00:06:51.150
We get to edit,

00:06:51.150 --> 00:06:54.150
and that means we get to delete,

00:06:54.150 --> 00:06:57.150
and that means we get to retouch,

00:06:57.150 --> 00:06:59.150
the face, the voice,

00:06:59.150 --> 00:07:01.150
the flesh, the body --

00:07:01.150 --> 00:07:04.150
not too little, not too much,

00:07:04.150 --> 00:07:06.150
just right.

00:07:06.150 --> 00:07:08.150
Human relationships

00:07:08.150 --> 00:07:10.150
are rich and they're messy

00:07:10.150 --> 00:07:12.150
and they're demanding.

00:07:12.150 --> 00:07:15.150
And we clean them up with technology.

00:07:15.150 --> 00:07:17.150
And when we do,

00:07:17.150 --> 00:07:19.150
one of the things that can happen

00:07:19.150 --> 00:07:21.150
is that we sacrifice conversation

00:07:21.150 --> 00:07:23.150
for mere connection.

00:07:23.150 --> 00:07:26.150
We short-change ourselves.

00:07:26.150 --> 00:07:28.150
And over time,

00:07:28.150 --> 00:07:30.150
we seem to forget this,

00:07:30.150 --> 00:07:33.150
or we seem to stop caring.

00:07:33.150 --> 00:07:37.150
I was caught off guard

00:07:37.150 --> 00:07:39.150
when Stephen Colbert

00:07:39.150 --> 00:07:43.150
asked me a profound question,

00:07:43.150 --> 00:07:46.150
a profound question.

00:07:46.150 --> 00:07:52.150
He said, "Don't all those little tweets,

00:07:52.150 --> 00:07:55.150
don't all those little sips

00:07:55.150 --> 00:07:58.150
of online communication,

00:07:58.150 --> 00:08:01.150
add up to one big gulp

00:08:01.150 --> 00:08:05.150
of real conversation?"

00:08:05.150 --> 00:08:07.150
My answer was no,

00:08:07.150 --> 00:08:09.150
they don't add up.

00:08:09.150 --> 00:08:13.150
Connecting in sips may work

00:08:13.150 --> 00:08:17.150
for gathering discrete bits of information,

00:08:17.150 --> 00:08:21.150
they may work for saying, "I'm thinking about you,"

00:08:21.150 --> 00:08:23.150
or even for saying, "I love you," --

00:08:23.150 --> 00:08:25.150
I mean, look at how I felt

00:08:25.150 --> 00:08:28.150
when I got that text from my daughter --

00:08:28.150 --> 00:08:30.150
but they don't really work

00:08:30.150 --> 00:08:32.150
for learning about each other,

00:08:32.150 --> 00:08:36.150
for really coming to know and understand each other.

00:08:36.150 --> 00:08:40.150
And we use conversations with each other

00:08:40.150 --> 00:08:42.150
to learn how to have conversations

00:08:42.150 --> 00:08:44.150
with ourselves.

00:08:44.150 --> 00:08:46.150
So a flight from conversation

00:08:46.150 --> 00:08:48.150
can really matter

00:08:48.150 --> 00:08:50.150
because it can compromise

00:08:50.150 --> 00:08:52.150
our capacity for self-reflection.

00:08:52.150 --> 00:08:54.150
For kids growing up,

00:08:54.150 --> 00:08:58.150
that skill is the bedrock of development.

00:08:58.150 --> 00:09:00.150
Over and over I hear,

00:09:00.150 --> 00:09:03.150
"I would rather text than talk."

00:09:03.150 --> 00:09:05.150
And what I'm seeing

00:09:05.150 --> 00:09:07.150
is that people get so used to being short-changed

00:09:07.150 --> 00:09:09.150
out of real conversation,

00:09:09.150 --> 00:09:12.150
so used to getting by with less,

00:09:12.150 --> 00:09:14.150
that they've become almost willing

00:09:14.150 --> 00:09:16.150
to dispense with people altogether.

00:09:16.150 --> 00:09:18.150
So for example,

00:09:18.150 --> 00:09:20.150
many people share with me this wish,

00:09:20.150 --> 00:09:23.150
that some day a more advanced version of Siri,

00:09:23.150 --> 00:09:26.150
the digital assistant on Apple's iPhone,

00:09:26.150 --> 00:09:28.150
will be more like a best friend,

00:09:28.150 --> 00:09:30.150
someone who will listen

00:09:30.150 --> 00:09:32.150
when others won't.

00:09:32.150 --> 00:09:34.150
I believe this wish

00:09:34.150 --> 00:09:36.150
reflects a painful truth

00:09:36.150 --> 00:09:39.150
that I've learned in the past 15 years.

00:09:39.150 --> 00:09:43.150
That feeling that no one is listening to me

00:09:43.150 --> 00:09:45.150
is very important

00:09:45.150 --> 00:09:47.150
in our relationships with technology.

00:09:47.150 --> 00:09:49.150
That's why it's so appealing

00:09:49.150 --> 00:09:51.150
to have a Facebook page

00:09:51.150 --> 00:09:53.150
or a Twitter feed --

00:09:53.150 --> 00:09:56.150
so many automatic listeners.

00:09:56.150 --> 00:09:59.150
And the feeling that no one is listening to me

00:09:59.150 --> 00:10:01.150
make us want to spend time

00:10:01.150 --> 00:10:04.150
with machines that seem to care about us.

00:10:04.150 --> 00:10:06.150
We're developing robots,

00:10:06.150 --> 00:10:08.150
they call them sociable robots,

00:10:08.150 --> 00:10:11.150
that are specifically designed to be companions --

00:10:11.150 --> 00:10:13.150
to the elderly,

00:10:13.150 --> 00:10:15.150
to our children,

00:10:15.150 --> 00:10:17.150
to us.

00:10:17.150 --> 00:10:20.150
Have we so lost confidence

00:10:20.150 --> 00:10:24.150
that we will be there for each other?

00:10:24.150 --> 00:10:26.150
During my research

00:10:26.150 --> 00:10:28.150
I worked in nursing homes,

00:10:28.150 --> 00:10:31.150
and I brought in these sociable robots

00:10:31.150 --> 00:10:33.150
that were designed to give the elderly

00:10:33.150 --> 00:10:36.150
the feeling that they were understood.

00:10:36.150 --> 00:10:38.150
And one day I came in

00:10:38.150 --> 00:10:40.150
and a woman who had lost a child

00:10:40.150 --> 00:10:42.150
was talking to a robot

00:10:42.150 --> 00:10:45.150
in the shape of a baby seal.

00:10:45.150 --> 00:10:47.150
It seemed to be looking in her eyes.

00:10:47.150 --> 00:10:50.150
It seemed to be following the conversation.

00:10:50.150 --> 00:10:53.150
It comforted her.

00:10:53.150 --> 00:10:57.150
And many people found this amazing.

00:10:57.150 --> 00:11:02.150
But that woman was trying to make sense of her life

00:11:02.150 --> 00:11:05.150
with a machine that had no experience

00:11:05.150 --> 00:11:08.150
of the arc of a human life.

00:11:08.150 --> 00:11:10.150
That robot put on a great show.

00:11:10.150 --> 00:11:12.150
And we're vulnerable.

00:11:12.150 --> 00:11:15.150
People experience pretend empathy

00:11:15.150 --> 00:11:18.150
as though it were the real thing.

00:11:18.150 --> 00:11:22.150
So during that moment

00:11:22.150 --> 00:11:24.150
when that woman

00:11:24.150 --> 00:11:27.150
was experiencing that pretend empathy,

00:11:27.150 --> 00:11:30.150
I was thinking, "That robot can't empathize.

00:11:30.150 --> 00:11:32.150
It doesn't face death.

00:11:32.150 --> 00:11:34.150
It doesn't know life."

00:11:34.150 --> 00:11:36.150
And as that woman took comfort

00:11:36.150 --> 00:11:38.150
in her robot companion,

00:11:38.150 --> 00:11:40.150
I didn't find it amazing;

00:11:40.150 --> 00:11:44.150
I found it one of the most wrenching, complicated moments

00:11:44.150 --> 00:11:48.150
in my 15 years of work.

00:11:48.150 --> 00:11:50.150
But when I stepped back,

00:11:50.150 --> 00:11:52.150
I felt myself

00:11:52.150 --> 00:11:55.150
at the cold, hard center

00:11:55.150 --> 00:11:57.150
of a perfect storm.

00:11:57.150 --> 00:12:00.150
We expect more from technology

00:12:00.150 --> 00:12:03.150
and less from each other.

00:12:03.150 --> 00:12:05.150
And I ask myself,

00:12:05.150 --> 00:12:08.150
"Why have things come to this?"

00:12:08.150 --> 00:12:10.150
And I believe it's because

00:12:10.150 --> 00:12:13.150
technology appeals to us most

00:12:13.150 --> 00:12:15.150
where we are most vulnerable.

00:12:15.150 --> 00:12:17.150
And we are vulnerable.

00:12:17.150 --> 00:12:19.150
We're lonely,

00:12:19.150 --> 00:12:21.150
but we're afraid of intimacy.

00:12:21.150 --> 00:12:24.150
And so from social networks to sociable robots,

00:12:24.150 --> 00:12:26.150
we're designing technologies

00:12:26.150 --> 00:12:29.150
that will give us the illusion of companionship

00:12:29.150 --> 00:12:31.150
without the demands of friendship.

00:12:31.150 --> 00:12:34.150
We turn to technology to help us feel connected

00:12:34.150 --> 00:12:37.150
in ways we can comfortably control.

00:12:37.150 --> 00:12:39.150
But we're not so comfortable.

00:12:39.150 --> 00:12:42.150
We are not so much in control.

00:12:42.150 --> 00:12:45.150
These days, those phones in our pockets

00:12:45.150 --> 00:12:47.150
are changing our minds and hearts

00:12:47.150 --> 00:12:49.150
because they offer us

00:12:49.150 --> 00:12:51.150
three gratifying fantasies.

00:12:51.150 --> 00:12:53.150
One, that we can put our attention

00:12:53.150 --> 00:12:55.150
wherever we want it to be;

00:12:55.150 --> 00:12:58.150
two, that we will always be heard;

00:12:58.150 --> 00:13:01.150
and three, that we will never have to be alone.

00:13:01.150 --> 00:13:03.150
And that third idea,

00:13:03.150 --> 00:13:06.150
that we will never have to be alone,

00:13:06.150 --> 00:13:08.150
is central to changing our psyches.

00:13:08.150 --> 00:13:11.150
Because the moment that people are alone,

00:13:11.150 --> 00:13:13.150
even for a few seconds,

00:13:13.150 --> 00:13:16.150
they become anxious, they panic, they fidget,

00:13:16.150 --> 00:13:18.150
they reach for a device.

00:13:18.150 --> 00:13:20.150
Just think of people at a checkout line

00:13:20.150 --> 00:13:22.150
or at a red light.

00:13:22.150 --> 00:13:26.150
Being alone feels like a problem that needs to be solved.

00:13:26.150 --> 00:13:29.150
And so people try to solve it by connecting.

00:13:29.150 --> 00:13:31.150
But here, connection

00:13:31.150 --> 00:13:34.150
is more like a symptom than a cure.

00:13:34.150 --> 00:13:37.150
It expresses, but it doesn't solve,

00:13:37.150 --> 00:13:39.150
an underlying problem.

00:13:39.150 --> 00:13:41.150
But more than a symptom,

00:13:41.150 --> 00:13:43.150
constant connection is changing

00:13:43.150 --> 00:13:45.150
the way people think of themselves.

00:13:45.150 --> 00:13:48.150
It's shaping a new way of being.

00:13:48.150 --> 00:13:50.150
The best way to describe it is,

00:13:50.150 --> 00:13:53.150
I share therefore I am.

00:13:53.150 --> 00:13:56.150
We use technology to define ourselves

00:13:56.150 --> 00:13:58.150
by sharing our thoughts and feelings

00:13:58.150 --> 00:14:00.150
even as we're having them.

00:14:00.150 --> 00:14:02.150
So before it was:

00:14:02.150 --> 00:14:04.150
I have a feeling,

00:14:04.150 --> 00:14:06.150
I want to make a call.

00:14:06.150 --> 00:14:09.150
Now it's: I want to have a feeling,

00:14:09.150 --> 00:14:11.150
I need to send a text.

00:14:11.150 --> 00:14:14.150
The problem with this new regime

00:14:14.150 --> 00:14:16.150
of "I share therefore I am"

00:14:16.150 --> 00:14:18.150
is that, if we don't have connection,

00:14:18.150 --> 00:14:20.150
we don't feel like ourselves.

00:14:20.150 --> 00:14:22.150
We almost don't feel ourselves.

00:14:22.150 --> 00:14:25.150
So what do we do? We connect more and more.

00:14:25.150 --> 00:14:27.150
But in the process,

00:14:27.150 --> 00:14:30.150
we set ourselves up to be isolated.

00:14:30.150 --> 00:14:34.150
How do you get from connection to isolation?

00:14:34.150 --> 00:14:36.150
You end up isolated

00:14:36.150 --> 00:14:38.150
if you don't cultivate the capacity for solitude,

00:14:38.150 --> 00:14:41.150
the ability to be separate,

00:14:41.150 --> 00:14:43.150
to gather yourself.

00:14:43.150 --> 00:14:46.150
Solitude is where you find yourself

00:14:46.150 --> 00:14:48.150
so that you can reach out to other people

00:14:48.150 --> 00:14:51.150
and form real attachments.

00:14:51.150 --> 00:14:54.150
When we don't have the capacity for solitude,

00:14:54.150 --> 00:14:57.150
we turn to other people in order to feel less anxious

00:14:57.150 --> 00:14:59.150
or in order to feel alive.

00:14:59.150 --> 00:15:01.150
When this happens,

00:15:01.150 --> 00:15:04.150
we're not able to appreciate who they are.

00:15:04.150 --> 00:15:06.150
It's as though we're using them

00:15:06.150 --> 00:15:08.150
as spare parts

00:15:08.150 --> 00:15:11.150
to support our fragile sense of self.

00:15:11.150 --> 00:15:14.150
We slip into thinking that always being connected

00:15:14.150 --> 00:15:18.150
is going to make us feel less alone.

00:15:18.150 --> 00:15:20.150
But we're at risk,

00:15:20.150 --> 00:15:23.150
because actually it's the opposite that's true.

00:15:23.150 --> 00:15:25.150
If we're not able to be alone,

00:15:25.150 --> 00:15:27.150
we're going to be more lonely.

00:15:27.150 --> 00:15:30.150
And if we don't teach our children to be alone,

00:15:30.150 --> 00:15:32.150
they're only going to know

00:15:32.150 --> 00:15:34.150
how to be lonely.

00:15:34.150 --> 00:15:37.150
When I spoke at TED in 1996,

00:15:37.150 --> 00:15:39.150
reporting on my studies

00:15:39.150 --> 00:15:41.150
of the early virtual communities,

00:15:41.150 --> 00:15:44.150
I said, "Those who make the most

00:15:44.150 --> 00:15:46.150
of their lives on the screen

00:15:46.150 --> 00:15:49.150
come to it in a spirit of self-reflection."

00:15:49.150 --> 00:15:52.150
And that's what I'm calling for here, now:

00:15:52.150 --> 00:15:55.150
reflection and, more than that, a conversation

00:15:55.150 --> 00:15:58.150
about where our current use of technology

00:15:58.150 --> 00:16:00.150
may be taking us,

00:16:00.150 --> 00:16:02.150
what it might be costing us.

00:16:02.150 --> 00:16:05.150
We're smitten with technology.

00:16:05.150 --> 00:16:08.150
And we're afraid, like young lovers,

00:16:08.150 --> 00:16:11.150
that too much talking might spoil the romance.

00:16:11.150 --> 00:16:13.150
But it's time to talk.

00:16:13.150 --> 00:16:16.150
We grew up with digital technology

00:16:16.150 --> 00:16:18.150
and so we see it as all grown up.

00:16:18.150 --> 00:16:21.150
But it's not, it's early days.

00:16:21.150 --> 00:16:23.150
There's plenty of time

00:16:23.150 --> 00:16:25.150
for us to reconsider how we use it,

00:16:25.150 --> 00:16:27.150
how we build it.

00:16:27.150 --> 00:16:29.150
I'm not suggesting

00:16:29.150 --> 00:16:31.150
that we turn away from our devices,

00:16:31.150 --> 00:16:34.150
just that we develop a more self-aware relationship

00:16:34.150 --> 00:16:36.150
with them, with each other

00:16:36.150 --> 00:16:39.150
and with ourselves.

00:16:39.150 --> 00:16:41.150
I see some first steps.

00:16:41.150 --> 00:16:43.150
Start thinking of solitude

00:16:43.150 --> 00:16:45.150
as a good thing.

00:16:45.150 --> 00:16:47.150
Make room for it.

00:16:47.150 --> 00:16:50.150
Find ways to demonstrate this

00:16:50.150 --> 00:16:52.150
as a value to your children.

00:16:52.150 --> 00:16:54.150
Create sacred spaces at home --

00:16:54.150 --> 00:16:56.150
the kitchen, the dining room --

00:16:56.150 --> 00:16:59.150
and reclaim them for conversation.

00:16:59.150 --> 00:17:01.150
Do the same thing at work.

00:17:01.150 --> 00:17:03.150
At work, we're so busy communicating

00:17:03.150 --> 00:17:06.150
that we often don't have time to think,

00:17:06.150 --> 00:17:09.150
we don't have time to talk,

00:17:09.150 --> 00:17:11.150
about the things that really matter.

00:17:11.150 --> 00:17:13.150
Change that.

00:17:13.150 --> 00:17:17.150
Most important, we all really need to listen to each other,

00:17:17.150 --> 00:17:21.150
including to the boring bits.

00:17:21.150 --> 00:17:23.150
Because it's when we stumble

00:17:23.150 --> 00:17:26.150
or hesitate or lose our words

00:17:26.150 --> 00:17:30.150
that we reveal ourselves to each other.

00:17:30.150 --> 00:17:33.150
Technology is making a bid

00:17:33.150 --> 00:17:35.150
to redefine human connection --

00:17:35.150 --> 00:17:37.150
how we care for each other,

00:17:37.150 --> 00:17:39.150
how we care for ourselves --

00:17:39.150 --> 00:17:41.150
but it's also giving us the opportunity

00:17:41.150 --> 00:17:43.150
to affirm our values

00:17:43.150 --> 00:17:45.150
and our direction.

00:17:45.150 --> 00:17:47.150
I'm optimistic.

00:17:47.150 --> 00:17:50.150
We have everything we need to start.

00:17:50.150 --> 00:17:52.150
We have each other.

00:17:52.150 --> 00:17:55.150
And we have the greatest chance of success

00:17:55.150 --> 00:17:58.150
if we recognize our vulnerability.

00:17:58.150 --> 00:18:00.150
That we listen

00:18:00.150 --> 00:18:02.150
when technology says

00:18:02.150 --> 00:18:05.150
it will take something complicated

00:18:05.150 --> 00:18:08.150
and promises something simpler.

00:18:08.150 --> 00:18:10.150
So in my work,

00:18:10.150 --> 00:18:13.150
I hear that life is hard,

00:18:13.150 --> 00:18:15.150
relationships are filled with risk.

00:18:15.150 --> 00:18:17.150
And then there's technology --

00:18:17.150 --> 00:18:19.150
simpler, hopeful,

00:18:19.150 --> 00:18:22.150
optimistic, ever-young.

00:18:22.150 --> 00:18:24.150
It's like calling in the cavalry.

00:18:24.150 --> 00:18:26.150
An ad campaign promises

00:18:26.150 --> 00:18:28.150
that online and with avatars,

00:18:28.150 --> 00:18:32.150
you can "Finally, love your friends

00:18:32.150 --> 00:18:35.150
love your body, love your life,

00:18:35.150 --> 00:18:38.150
online and with avatars."

00:18:38.150 --> 00:18:40.150
We're drawn to virtual romance,

00:18:40.150 --> 00:18:43.150
to computer games that seem like worlds,

00:18:43.150 --> 00:18:47.150
to the idea that robots, robots,

00:18:47.150 --> 00:18:50.150
will someday be our true companions.

00:18:50.150 --> 00:18:53.150
We spend an evening on the social network

00:18:53.150 --> 00:18:56.150
instead of going to the pub with friends.

00:18:56.150 --> 00:18:58.150
But our fantasies of substitution

00:18:58.150 --> 00:19:01.150
have cost us.

00:19:01.150 --> 00:19:04.150
Now we all need to focus

00:19:04.150 --> 00:19:06.150
on the many, many ways

00:19:06.150 --> 00:19:08.150
technology can lead us back

00:19:08.150 --> 00:19:11.150
to our real lives, our own bodies,

00:19:11.150 --> 00:19:13.150
our own communities,

00:19:13.150 --> 00:19:15.150
our own politics,

00:19:15.150 --> 00:19:17.150
our own planet.

00:19:17.150 --> 00:19:19.150
They need us.

00:19:19.150 --> 00:19:21.150
Let's talk about

00:19:21.150 --> 00:19:24.150
how we can use digital technology,

00:19:24.150 --> 00:19:27.150
the technology of our dreams,

00:19:27.150 --> 00:19:29.150
to make this life

00:19:29.150 --> 00:19:31.150
the life we can love.

00:19:31.150 --> 00:19:33.150
Thank you.

00:19:33.150 --> 00:19:39.150
(Applause)
