WEBVTT

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:14.150
If you had caught me straight out of college

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:16.150
in the halls of the Vermont State House

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:19.150
where I was a lobbyist in training

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:21.150
and asked me what I was going to do with my life,

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.150
I would have told you

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:25.150
that I'd just passed the Hanyu Shuiping Kaoshi,

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:27.150
the Chinese equivalency exam,

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.150
and I was going to go study law in Beijing,

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:34.150
and I was going to improve U.S.-China relations

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:36.150
through top-down policy changes

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:38.150
and judicial system reforms.

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:41.150
(Laughter)

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:43.150
(Applause)

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:46.150
I had a plan,

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:49.150
and I never ever thought

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:51.150
it would have anything to do

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:55.150
with the banjo.

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:57.150
Little did I know

00:00:57.150 --> 00:00:59.150
what a huge impact it would have on me one night

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:01.150
when I was at a party

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:03.150
and I heard a sound coming out of a record player

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:05.150
in the corner of a room.

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:07.150
And it was Doc Watson

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:10.150
singing and playing "Shady Grove."

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:12.150
♫ Shady Grove, my little love ♫

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.150
♫ Shady Grove, my darlin' ♫

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:17.150
♫ Shady Grove, my little love ♫

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:20.150
♫ Going back to Harlan ♫

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:24.150
That sound was just so beautiful,

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.150
the sound of Doc's voice

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:30.150
and the rippling groove of the banjo.

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:34.150
And after being totally and completely obsessed

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:36.150
with the mammoth richness and history

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.150
of Chinese culture,

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:42.150
it was like this total relief

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:45.150
to hear something so truly American

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:48.150
and so truly awesome.

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:51.150
I knew I had to take a banjo with me to China.

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:55.150
So before going to law school in China

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:58.150
I bought a banjo, I threw it in my little red truck

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:01.150
and I traveled down through Appalachia

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:03.150
and I learned a bunch of old American songs,

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:05.150
and I ended up in Kentucky

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:08.150
at the International Bluegrass Music Association Convention.

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:11.150
And I was sitting in a hallway one night

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:13.150
and a couple girls came up to me.

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:15.150
And they said, "Hey, do you want to jam?"

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:17.150
And I was like, "Sure."

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:19.150
So I picked up my banjo

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:22.150
and I nervously played four songs that I actually knew with them.

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:24.150
And a record executive walked up to me

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:27.150
and invited me to Nashville, Tennessee to make a record.

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:31.150
(Laughter)

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:38.150
It's been eight years,

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:42.150
and I can tell you that I didn't go to China to become a lawyer.

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:44.150
In fact, I went to Nashville.

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:47.150
And after a few months I was writing songs.

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:49.150
And the first song I wrote was in English,

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:52.150
and the second one was in Chinese.

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:56.150
(Music)

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:06.150
[Chinese]

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:08.150
Outside your door the world is waiting.

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:10.150
Inside your heart a voice is calling.

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:12.150
The four corners of the world are watching,

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:15.150
so travel daughter, travel.

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:17.150
Go get it, girl.

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:26.150
(Applause)

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:30.150
It's really been eight years since that fated night in Kentucky.

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:32.150
And I've played thousands of shows.

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:34.150
And I've collaborated

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:38.150
with so many incredible, inspirational musicians around the world.

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:40.150
And I see the power of music.

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:42.150
I see the power of music

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:44.150
to connect cultures.

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:46.150
I see it when I stand on a stage

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:48.150
in a bluegrass festival in east Virginia

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:50.150
and I look out at the sea of lawn chairs

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:53.150
and I bust out into a song in Chinese.

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:56.150
[Chinese]

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:59.150
And everybody's eyes just pop wide open

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:02.150
like it's going to fall out of their heads.

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:04.150
And they're like, "What's that girl doing?"

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:07.150
And then they come up to me after the show

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:09.150
and they all have a story.

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:11.150
They all come up and they're like,

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:15.150
"You know, my aunt's sister's babysitter's dog's chicken went to China

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:17.150
and adopted a girl."

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:21.150
And I tell you what, it like everybody's got a story.

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:24.150
It's just incredible.

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:26.150
And then I go to China

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:29.150
and I stand on a stage at a university

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:31.150
and I bust out into a song in Chinese

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:34.150
and everybody sings along

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:36.150
and they roar with delight

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:38.150
at this girl

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:40.150
with the hair and the instrument,

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:43.150
and she's singing their music.

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:48.150
And I see, even more importantly,

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:51.150
the power of music to connect hearts.

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:54.150
Like the time I was in Sichuan Province

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:57.150
and I was singing for kids in relocation schools

00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:59.150
in the earthquake disaster zone.

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:02.150
And this little girl comes up to me.

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:08.150
[Chinese]

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:10.150
"Big sister Wong,"

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:14.150
Washburn, Wong, same difference.

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:17.150
"Big sister Wong, can I sing you a song

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:19.150
that my mom sang for me

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:23.150
before she was swallowed in the earthquake?"

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:25.150
And I sat down,

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:27.150
she sat on my lap.

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:30.150
She started singing her song.

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:33.150
And the warmth of her body

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:37.150
and the tears rolling down her rosy cheeks,

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:40.150
and I started to cry.

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:44.150
And the light that shone off of her eyes

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:48.150
was a place I could have stayed forever.

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:51.150
And in that moment, we weren't our American selves,

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:53.150
we weren't our Chinese selves,

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:57.150
we were just mortals

00:05:57.150 --> 00:06:02.150
sitting together in that light that keeps us here.

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:06.150
I want to dwell in that light

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:08.150
with you and with everyone.

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:10.150
And I know U.S.-China relations

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:12.150
doesn't need another lawyer.

00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:14.150
Thank you.

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:24.150
(Applause)
