WEBVTT

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.150
I got my start

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:17.150
in writing and research

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:20.150
as a surgical trainee,

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:22.150
as someone who was a long ways away

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:25.150
from becoming any kind of an expert at anything.

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:28.150
So the natural question you ask then at that point

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:30.150
is, how do I get good at what I'm trying to do?

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.150
And it became a question of,

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:34.150
how do we all get good

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:37.150
at what we're trying to do?

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:41.150
It's hard enough to learn to get the skills,

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:44.150
try to learn all the material you have to absorb

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:46.150
at any task you're taking on.

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:49.150
I had to think about how I sew and how I cut,

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:51.150
but then also how I pick the right person

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:53.150
to come to an operating room.

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:55.150
And then in the midst of all this

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:57.150
came this new context

00:00:57.150 --> 00:00:59.150
for thinking about what it meant to be good.

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:01.150
In the last few years

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:04.150
we realized we were in the deepest crisis

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:06.150
of medicine's existence

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.150
due to something you don't normally think about

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:10.150
when you're a doctor

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:13.150
concerned with how you do good for people,

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:15.150
which is the cost

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.150
of health care.

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:20.150
There's not a country in the world

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:22.150
that now is not asking

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:25.150
whether we can afford what doctors do.

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:28.150
The political fight that we've developed

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:30.150
has become one around

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.150
whether it's the government that's the problem

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:36.150
or is it insurance companies that are the problem.

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:42.150
And the answer is yes and no;

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.150
it's deeper than all of that.

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:46.150
The cause of our troubles

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:49.150
is actually the complexity that science has given us.

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:51.150
And in order to understand this,

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:55.150
I'm going to take you back a couple of generations.

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:57.150
I want to take you back

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:00.150
to a time when Lewis Thomas was writing in his book, "The Youngest Science."

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:02.150
Lewis Thomas was a physician-writer,

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:04.150
one of my favorite writers.

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:07.150
And he wrote this book to explain, among other things,

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:10.150
what it was like to be a medical intern

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:12.150
at the Boston City Hospital

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:14.150
in the pre-penicillin year

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:17.150
of 1937.

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:21.150
It was a time when medicine was cheap

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:25.150
and very ineffective.

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:28.150
If you were in a hospital, he said,

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:31.150
it was going to do you good

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:33.150
only because it offered you

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:37.150
some warmth, some food, shelter,

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:39.150
and maybe the caring attention

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:41.150
of a nurse.

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:45.150
Doctors and medicine

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:47.150
made no difference at all.

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:49.150
That didn't seem to prevent the doctors

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:51.150
from being frantically busy in their days,

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:53.150
as he explained.

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:55.150
What they were trying to do

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:58.150
was figure out whether you might have one of the diagnoses

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:01.150
for which they could do something.

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:03.150
And there were a few.

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:06.150
You might have a lobar pneumonia, for example,

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:08.150
and they could give you an antiserum,

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:12.150
an injection of rabid antibodies

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:15.150
to the bacterium streptococcus,

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:19.150
if the intern sub-typed it correctly.

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:22.150
If you had an acute congestive heart failure,

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:25.150
they could bleed a pint of blood from you

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:28.150
by opening up an arm vein,

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:31.150
giving you a crude leaf preparation of digitalis

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:36.150
and then giving you oxygen by tent.

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:38.150
If you had early signs of paralysis

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:41.150
and you were really good at asking personal questions,

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:43.150
you might figure out

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:46.150
that this paralysis someone has is from syphilis,

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:49.150
in which case you could give this nice concoction

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:53.150
of mercury and arsenic --

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:56.150
as long as you didn't overdose them and kill them.

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:00.150
Beyond these sorts of things,

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:05.150
a medical doctor didn't have a lot that they could do.

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:07.150
This was when the core structure of medicine

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:09.150
was created --

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:12.150
what it meant to be good at what we did

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:14.150
and how we wanted to build medicine to be.

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:16.150
It was at a time

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:18.150
when what was known you could know,

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:21.150
you could hold it all in your head, and you could do it all.

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:23.150
If you had a prescription pad,

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:25.150
if you had a nurse,

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:27.150
if you had a hospital

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:30.150
that would give you a place to convalesce, maybe some basic tools,

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:32.150
you really could do it all.

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:35.150
You set the fracture, you drew the blood,

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:37.150
you spun the blood,

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:39.150
looked at it under the microscope,

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:42.150
you plated the culture, you injected the antiserum.

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:47.150
This was a life as a craftsman.

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:50.150
As a result, we built it around

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:52.150
a culture and set of values

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:55.150
that said what you were good at

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:57.150
was being daring,

00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:59.150
at being courageous,

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:03.150
at being independent and self-sufficient.

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:08.150
Autonomy was our highest value.

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:11.150
Go a couple generations forward

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:13.150
to where we are, though,

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:15.150
and it looks like a completely different world.

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:18.150
We have now found treatments

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:22.150
for nearly all of the tens of thousands of conditions

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:24.150
that a human being can have.

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:26.150
We can't cure it all.

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:29.150
We can't guarantee that everybody will live a long and healthy life.

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:31.150
But we can make it possible

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:34.150
for most.

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:36.150
But what does it take?

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:38.150
Well, we've now discovered

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:42.150
4,000 medical and surgical procedures.

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:45.150
We've discovered 6,000 drugs

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:48.150
that I'm now licensed to prescribe.

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:50.150
And we're trying to deploy this capability,

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:52.150
town by town,

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:56.150
to every person alive --

00:05:56.150 --> 00:05:58.150
in our own country,

00:05:58.150 --> 00:06:00.150
let alone around the world.

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:03.150
And we've reached the point where we've realized,

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:05.150
as doctors,

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:07.150
we can't know it all.

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:10.150
We can't do it all

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:12.150
by ourselves.

00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:14.150
There was a study where they looked

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:16.150
at how many clinicians it took to take care of you

00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:18.150
if you came into a hospital,

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:20.150
as it changed over time.

00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:22.150
And in the year 1970,

00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:25.150
it took just over two full-time equivalents of clinicians.

00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:27.150
That is to say,

00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:30.150
it took basically the nursing time

00:06:30.150 --> 00:06:32.150
and then just a little bit of time for a doctor

00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:34.150
who more or less checked in on you

00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:36.150
once a day.

00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:39.150
By the end of the 20th century,

00:06:39.150 --> 00:06:42.150
it had become more than 15 clinicians

00:06:42.150 --> 00:06:45.150
for the same typical hospital patient --

00:06:45.150 --> 00:06:48.150
specialists, physical therapists,

00:06:48.150 --> 00:06:51.150
the nurses.

00:06:51.150 --> 00:06:53.150
We're all specialists now,

00:06:53.150 --> 00:06:55.150
even the primary care physicians.

00:06:55.150 --> 00:06:57.150
Everyone just has

00:06:57.150 --> 00:07:00.150
a piece of the care.

00:07:00.150 --> 00:07:02.150
But holding onto that structure we built

00:07:02.150 --> 00:07:04.150
around the daring, independence,

00:07:04.150 --> 00:07:06.150
self-sufficiency

00:07:06.150 --> 00:07:09.150
of each of those people

00:07:09.150 --> 00:07:11.150
has become a disaster.

00:07:11.150 --> 00:07:15.150
We have trained, hired and rewarded people

00:07:15.150 --> 00:07:18.150
to be cowboys.

00:07:18.150 --> 00:07:21.150
But it's pit crews that we need,

00:07:21.150 --> 00:07:23.150
pit crews for patients.

00:07:23.150 --> 00:07:25.150
There's evidence all around us:

00:07:25.150 --> 00:07:28.150
40 percent of our coronary artery disease patients

00:07:28.150 --> 00:07:30.150
in our communities

00:07:30.150 --> 00:07:34.150
receive incomplete or inappropriate care.

00:07:34.150 --> 00:07:36.150
60 percent

00:07:36.150 --> 00:07:39.150
of our asthma, stroke patients

00:07:39.150 --> 00:07:43.150
receive incomplete or inappropriate care.

00:07:43.150 --> 00:07:46.150
Two million people come into hospitals

00:07:46.150 --> 00:07:48.150
and pick up an infection

00:07:48.150 --> 00:07:50.150
they didn't have

00:07:50.150 --> 00:07:53.150
because someone failed to follow

00:07:53.150 --> 00:07:56.150
the basic practices of hygiene.

00:07:56.150 --> 00:07:58.150
Our experience

00:07:58.150 --> 00:08:00.150
as people who get sick,

00:08:00.150 --> 00:08:02.150
need help from other people,

00:08:02.150 --> 00:08:05.150
is that we have amazing clinicians

00:08:05.150 --> 00:08:07.150
that we can turn to --

00:08:07.150 --> 00:08:10.150
hardworking, incredibly well-trained and very smart --

00:08:10.150 --> 00:08:13.150
that we have access to incredible technologies

00:08:13.150 --> 00:08:15.150
that give us great hope,

00:08:15.150 --> 00:08:17.150
but little sense

00:08:17.150 --> 00:08:21.150
that it consistently all comes together for you

00:08:21.150 --> 00:08:24.150
from start to finish

00:08:24.150 --> 00:08:27.150
in a successful way.

00:08:27.150 --> 00:08:29.150
There's another sign

00:08:29.150 --> 00:08:31.150
that we need pit crews,

00:08:31.150 --> 00:08:34.150
and that's the unmanageable cost

00:08:34.150 --> 00:08:37.150
of our care.

00:08:37.150 --> 00:08:39.150
Now we in medicine, I think,

00:08:39.150 --> 00:08:41.150
are baffled by this question of cost.

00:08:41.150 --> 00:08:45.150
We want to say, "This is just the way it is.

00:08:45.150 --> 00:08:47.150
This is just what medicine requires."

00:08:47.150 --> 00:08:49.150
When you go from a world

00:08:49.150 --> 00:08:52.150
where you treated arthritis with aspirin,

00:08:52.150 --> 00:08:55.150
that mostly didn't do the job,

00:08:55.150 --> 00:08:57.150
to one where, if it gets bad enough,

00:08:57.150 --> 00:08:59.150
we can do a hip replacement, a knee replacement

00:08:59.150 --> 00:09:02.150
that gives you years, maybe decades,

00:09:02.150 --> 00:09:04.150
without disability,

00:09:04.150 --> 00:09:06.150
a dramatic change,

00:09:06.150 --> 00:09:08.150
well is it any surprise

00:09:08.150 --> 00:09:11.150
that that $40,000 hip replacement

00:09:11.150 --> 00:09:13.150
replacing the 10-cent aspirin

00:09:13.150 --> 00:09:15.150
is more expensive?

00:09:15.150 --> 00:09:18.150
It's just the way it is.

00:09:18.150 --> 00:09:20.150
But I think we're ignoring certain facts

00:09:20.150 --> 00:09:23.150
that tell us something about what we can do.

00:09:25.150 --> 00:09:27.150
As we've looked at the data

00:09:27.150 --> 00:09:30.150
about the results that have come

00:09:30.150 --> 00:09:32.150
as the complexity has increased,

00:09:32.150 --> 00:09:34.150
we found

00:09:34.150 --> 00:09:36.150
that the most expensive care

00:09:36.150 --> 00:09:39.150
is not necessarily the best care.

00:09:39.150 --> 00:09:41.150
And vice versa,

00:09:41.150 --> 00:09:43.150
the best care

00:09:43.150 --> 00:09:46.150
often turns out to be the least expensive --

00:09:46.150 --> 00:09:49.150
has fewer complications,

00:09:49.150 --> 00:09:52.150
the people get more efficient at what they do.

00:09:52.150 --> 00:09:54.150
And what that means

00:09:54.150 --> 00:09:57.150
is there's hope.

00:09:57.150 --> 00:10:00.150
Because [if] to have the best results,

00:10:00.150 --> 00:10:03.150
you really needed the most expensive care

00:10:03.150 --> 00:10:05.150
in the country, or in the world,

00:10:05.150 --> 00:10:08.150
well then we really would be talking about rationing

00:10:08.150 --> 00:10:12.150
who we're going to cut off from Medicare.

00:10:12.150 --> 00:10:16.150
That would be really our only choice.

00:10:16.150 --> 00:10:18.150
But when we look at the positive deviants --

00:10:18.150 --> 00:10:21.150
the ones who are getting the best results

00:10:21.150 --> 00:10:23.150
at the lowest costs --

00:10:23.150 --> 00:10:26.150
we find the ones that look the most like systems

00:10:26.150 --> 00:10:28.150
are the most successful.

00:10:28.150 --> 00:10:31.150
That is to say, they found ways

00:10:31.150 --> 00:10:33.150
to get all of the different pieces,

00:10:33.150 --> 00:10:35.150
all of the different components,

00:10:35.150 --> 00:10:38.150
to come together into a whole.

00:10:38.150 --> 00:10:41.150
Having great components is not enough,

00:10:41.150 --> 00:10:45.150
and yet we've been obsessed in medicine with components.

00:10:45.150 --> 00:10:48.150
We want the best drugs, the best technologies,

00:10:48.150 --> 00:10:51.150
the best specialists,

00:10:51.150 --> 00:10:53.150
but we don't think too much

00:10:53.150 --> 00:10:56.150
about how it all comes together.

00:10:56.150 --> 00:11:00.150
It's a terrible design strategy actually.

00:11:00.150 --> 00:11:03.150
There's a famous thought experiment

00:11:03.150 --> 00:11:05.150
that touches exactly on this

00:11:05.150 --> 00:11:07.150
that said, what if you built a car

00:11:07.150 --> 00:11:10.150
from the very best car parts?

00:11:10.150 --> 00:11:13.150
Well it would lead you to put in Porsche brakes,

00:11:13.150 --> 00:11:15.150
a Ferrari engine,

00:11:15.150 --> 00:11:18.150
a Volvo body, a BMW chassis.

00:11:18.150 --> 00:11:21.150
And you put it all together and what do you get?

00:11:21.150 --> 00:11:25.150
A very expensive pile of junk that does not go anywhere.

00:11:25.150 --> 00:11:30.150
And that is what medicine can feel like sometimes.

00:11:30.150 --> 00:11:33.150
It's not a system.

00:11:33.150 --> 00:11:35.150
Now a system, however,

00:11:35.150 --> 00:11:38.150
when things start to come together,

00:11:38.150 --> 00:11:41.150
you realize it has certain skills

00:11:41.150 --> 00:11:44.150
for acting and looking that way.

00:11:44.150 --> 00:11:46.150
Skill number one

00:11:46.150 --> 00:11:48.150
is the ability to recognize success

00:11:48.150 --> 00:11:51.150
and the ability to recognize failure.

00:11:51.150 --> 00:11:53.150
When you are a specialist,

00:11:53.150 --> 00:11:56.150
you can't see the end result very well.

00:11:56.150 --> 00:11:59.150
You have to become really interested in data,

00:11:59.150 --> 00:12:01.150
unsexy as that sounds.

00:12:01.150 --> 00:12:04.150
One of my colleagues is a surgeon in Cedar Rapids, Iowa,

00:12:04.150 --> 00:12:08.150
and he got interested in the question of,

00:12:08.150 --> 00:12:10.150
well how many CT scans did they do

00:12:10.150 --> 00:12:12.150
for their community in Cedar Rapids?

00:12:12.150 --> 00:12:14.150
He got interested in this

00:12:14.150 --> 00:12:16.150
because there had been government reports,

00:12:16.150 --> 00:12:18.150
newspaper reports, journal articles

00:12:18.150 --> 00:12:21.150
saying that there had been too many CT scans done.

00:12:21.150 --> 00:12:25.150
He didn't see it in his own patients.

00:12:25.150 --> 00:12:27.150
And so he asked the question, "How many did we do?"

00:12:27.150 --> 00:12:29.150
and he wanted to get the data.

00:12:29.150 --> 00:12:31.150
It took him three months.

00:12:31.150 --> 00:12:34.150
No one had asked this question in his community before.

00:12:34.150 --> 00:12:36.150
And what he found was that,

00:12:36.150 --> 00:12:38.150
for the 300,000 people in their community,

00:12:38.150 --> 00:12:40.150
in the previous year

00:12:40.150 --> 00:12:45.150
they had done 52,000 CT scans.

00:12:45.150 --> 00:12:48.150
They had found a problem.

00:12:48.150 --> 00:12:53.150
Which brings us to skill number two a system has.

00:12:53.150 --> 00:12:56.150
Skill one, find where your failures are.

00:12:56.150 --> 00:13:00.150
Skill two is devise solutions.

00:13:00.150 --> 00:13:02.150
I got interested in this

00:13:02.150 --> 00:13:04.150
when the World Health Organization came to my team

00:13:04.150 --> 00:13:06.150
asking if we could help with a project

00:13:06.150 --> 00:13:08.150
to reduce deaths in surgery.

00:13:08.150 --> 00:13:10.150
The volume of surgery had spread

00:13:10.150 --> 00:13:12.150
around the world,

00:13:12.150 --> 00:13:14.150
but the safety of surgery

00:13:14.150 --> 00:13:16.150
had not.

00:13:16.150 --> 00:13:19.150
Now our usual tactics for tackling problems like these

00:13:19.150 --> 00:13:21.150
are to do more training,

00:13:21.150 --> 00:13:24.150
give people more specialization

00:13:24.150 --> 00:13:27.150
or bring in more technology.

00:13:27.150 --> 00:13:30.150
Well in surgery, you couldn't have people who are more specialized

00:13:30.150 --> 00:13:33.150
and you couldn't have people who are better trained.

00:13:33.150 --> 00:13:36.150
And yet we see unconscionable levels

00:13:36.150 --> 00:13:40.150
of death, disability

00:13:40.150 --> 00:13:42.150
that could be avoided.

00:13:42.150 --> 00:13:44.150
And so we looked at what other high-risk industries do.

00:13:44.150 --> 00:13:46.150
We looked at skyscraper construction,

00:13:46.150 --> 00:13:49.150
we looked at the aviation world,

00:13:49.150 --> 00:13:51.150
and we found

00:13:51.150 --> 00:13:53.150
that they have technology, they have training,

00:13:53.150 --> 00:13:56.150
and then they have one other thing:

00:13:56.150 --> 00:13:59.150
They have checklists.

00:13:59.150 --> 00:14:01.150
I did not expect

00:14:01.150 --> 00:14:03.150
to be spending a significant part

00:14:03.150 --> 00:14:05.150
of my time as a Harvard surgeon

00:14:05.150 --> 00:14:08.150
worrying about checklists.

00:14:08.150 --> 00:14:10.150
And yet, what we found

00:14:10.150 --> 00:14:13.150
were that these were tools

00:14:13.150 --> 00:14:16.150
to help make experts better.

00:14:16.150 --> 00:14:20.150
We got the lead safety engineer for Boeing to help us.

00:14:20.150 --> 00:14:23.150
Could we design a checklist for surgery?

00:14:23.150 --> 00:14:25.150
Not for the lowest people on the totem pole,

00:14:25.150 --> 00:14:27.150
but for the folks

00:14:27.150 --> 00:14:29.150
who were all the way around the chain,

00:14:29.150 --> 00:14:31.150
the entire team including the surgeons.

00:14:31.150 --> 00:14:33.150
And what they taught us

00:14:33.150 --> 00:14:35.150
was that designing a checklist

00:14:35.150 --> 00:14:37.150
to help people handle complexity

00:14:37.150 --> 00:14:40.150
actually involves more difficulty than I had understood.

00:14:40.150 --> 00:14:42.150
You have to think about things

00:14:42.150 --> 00:14:44.150
like pause points.

00:14:44.150 --> 00:14:47.150
You need to identify the moments in a process

00:14:47.150 --> 00:14:49.150
when you can actually catch a problem before it's a danger

00:14:49.150 --> 00:14:51.150
and do something about it.

00:14:51.150 --> 00:14:53.150
You have to identify

00:14:53.150 --> 00:14:56.150
that this is a before-takeoff checklist.

00:14:56.150 --> 00:14:59.150
And then you need to focus on the killer items.

00:14:59.150 --> 00:15:01.150
An aviation checklist,

00:15:01.150 --> 00:15:03.150
like this one for a single-engine plane,

00:15:03.150 --> 00:15:05.150
isn't a recipe for how to fly a plane,

00:15:05.150 --> 00:15:07.150
it's a reminder of the key things

00:15:07.150 --> 00:15:10.150
that get forgotten or missed

00:15:10.150 --> 00:15:12.150
if they're not checked.

00:15:12.150 --> 00:15:14.150
So we did this.

00:15:14.150 --> 00:15:17.150
We created a 19-item two-minute checklist

00:15:17.150 --> 00:15:19.150
for surgical teams.

00:15:19.150 --> 00:15:21.150
We had the pause points

00:15:21.150 --> 00:15:24.150
immediately before anesthesia is given,

00:15:24.150 --> 00:15:27.150
immediately before the knife hits the skin,

00:15:27.150 --> 00:15:30.150
immediately before the patient leaves the room.

00:15:30.150 --> 00:15:33.150
And we had a mix of dumb stuff on there --

00:15:33.150 --> 00:15:36.150
making sure an antibiotic is given in the right time frame

00:15:36.150 --> 00:15:38.150
because that cuts the infection rate by half --

00:15:38.150 --> 00:15:40.150
and then interesting stuff,

00:15:40.150 --> 00:15:43.150
because you can't make a recipe for something as complicated as surgery.

00:15:43.150 --> 00:15:45.150
Instead, you can make a recipe

00:15:45.150 --> 00:15:48.150
for how to have a team that's prepared for the unexpected.

00:15:48.150 --> 00:15:51.150
And we had items like making sure everyone in the room

00:15:51.150 --> 00:15:54.150
had introduced themselves by name at the start of the day,

00:15:54.150 --> 00:15:56.150
because you get half a dozen people or more

00:15:56.150 --> 00:15:59.150
who are sometimes coming together as a team

00:15:59.150 --> 00:16:02.150
for the very first time that day that you're coming in.

00:16:02.150 --> 00:16:04.150
We implemented this checklist

00:16:04.150 --> 00:16:07.150
in eight hospitals around the world,

00:16:07.150 --> 00:16:09.150
deliberately in places from rural Tanzania

00:16:09.150 --> 00:16:12.150
to the University of Washington in Seattle.

00:16:12.150 --> 00:16:15.150
We found that after they adopted it

00:16:15.150 --> 00:16:17.150
the complication rates fell

00:16:17.150 --> 00:16:19.150
35 percent.

00:16:19.150 --> 00:16:22.150
It fell in every hospital it went into.

00:16:22.150 --> 00:16:24.150
The death rates fell

00:16:24.150 --> 00:16:27.150
47 percent.

00:16:27.150 --> 00:16:29.150
This was bigger than a drug.

00:16:29.150 --> 00:16:35.150
(Applause)

00:16:35.150 --> 00:16:37.150
And that brings us

00:16:37.150 --> 00:16:40.150
to skill number three,

00:16:40.150 --> 00:16:42.150
the ability to implement this,

00:16:42.150 --> 00:16:45.150
to get colleagues across the entire chain

00:16:45.150 --> 00:16:48.150
to actually do these things.

00:16:48.150 --> 00:16:50.150
And it's been slow to spread.

00:16:50.150 --> 00:16:54.150
This is not yet our norm in surgery --

00:16:54.150 --> 00:16:56.150
let alone making checklists

00:16:56.150 --> 00:16:59.150
to go onto childbirth and other areas.

00:16:59.150 --> 00:17:01.150
There's a deep resistance

00:17:01.150 --> 00:17:03.150
because using these tools

00:17:03.150 --> 00:17:05.150
forces us to confront

00:17:05.150 --> 00:17:07.150
that we're not a system,

00:17:07.150 --> 00:17:10.150
forces us to behave with a different set of values.

00:17:10.150 --> 00:17:12.150
Just using a checklist

00:17:12.150 --> 00:17:15.150
requires you to embrace different values from the ones we've had,

00:17:15.150 --> 00:17:19.150
like humility,

00:17:19.150 --> 00:17:22.150
discipline,

00:17:22.150 --> 00:17:24.150
teamwork.

00:17:24.150 --> 00:17:27.150
This is the opposite of what we were built on:

00:17:27.150 --> 00:17:29.150
independence, self-sufficiency,

00:17:29.150 --> 00:17:32.150
autonomy.

00:17:32.150 --> 00:17:35.150
I met an actual cowboy, by the way.

00:17:35.150 --> 00:17:38.150
I asked him, what was it like

00:17:38.150 --> 00:17:40.150
to actually herd a thousand cattle

00:17:40.150 --> 00:17:42.150
across hundreds of miles?

00:17:42.150 --> 00:17:44.150
How did you do that?

00:17:44.150 --> 00:17:47.150
And he said, "We have the cowboys stationed at distinct places all around."

00:17:47.150 --> 00:17:50.150
They communicate electronically constantly,

00:17:50.150 --> 00:17:52.150
and they have protocols and checklists

00:17:52.150 --> 00:17:54.150
for how they handle everything --

00:17:54.150 --> 00:17:56.150
(Laughter)

00:17:56.150 --> 00:17:58.150
-- from bad weather

00:17:58.150 --> 00:18:01.150
to emergencies or inoculations for the cattle.

00:18:01.150 --> 00:18:05.150
Even the cowboys are pit crews now.

00:18:05.150 --> 00:18:07.150
And it seemed like time

00:18:07.150 --> 00:18:09.150
that we become that way ourselves.

00:18:09.150 --> 00:18:11.150
Making systems work

00:18:11.150 --> 00:18:14.150
is the great task of my generation

00:18:14.150 --> 00:18:16.150
of physicians and scientists.

00:18:16.150 --> 00:18:18.150
But I would go further and say

00:18:18.150 --> 00:18:20.150
that making systems work,

00:18:20.150 --> 00:18:22.150
whether in health care, education,

00:18:22.150 --> 00:18:24.150
climate change,

00:18:24.150 --> 00:18:26.150
making a pathway out of poverty,

00:18:26.150 --> 00:18:30.150
is the great task of our generation as a whole.

00:18:30.150 --> 00:18:33.150
In every field, knowledge has exploded,

00:18:33.150 --> 00:18:35.150
but it has brought complexity,

00:18:35.150 --> 00:18:38.150
it has brought specialization.

00:18:38.150 --> 00:18:40.150
And we've come to a place where we have no choice

00:18:40.150 --> 00:18:42.150
but to recognize,

00:18:42.150 --> 00:18:45.150
as individualistic as we want to be,

00:18:45.150 --> 00:18:48.150
complexity requires

00:18:48.150 --> 00:18:50.150
group success.

00:18:50.150 --> 00:18:54.150
We all need to be pit crews now.

00:18:54.150 --> 00:18:56.150
Thank you.

00:18:56.150 --> 00:19:10.150
(Applause)
