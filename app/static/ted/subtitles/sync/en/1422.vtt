00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.150
Last January, my company, Fark.com, was sued

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:19.150
along with Yahoo, MSN, Reddit,

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:22.150
AOL, TechCrunch and others

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:25.150
by a company called Gooseberry Natural Resources.

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:27.150
Gooseberry owned a patent

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.150
for the creation and distribution

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:32.150
of news releases via email.

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:35.150
(Laughter)

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:38.150
Now it may seem kind of strange that such a thing can actually be patented,

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:40.150
but it does happen all the time.

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:42.150
Take something already being done

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:44.150
and patent it for an emerging technology --

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:47.150
like phone calls on the internet

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:50.150
or video listings for TV shows

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:52.150
or radio but for cellphones,

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:54.150
and so on.

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:56.150
The problem with these patents

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:58.150
is that the mechanisms are obscure

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:00.150
and the patent system is dysfunctional,

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:03.150
and as a result, most of these lawsuits end in settlements.

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:06.150
And because these settlements are under a non-disclosure agreement,

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.150
no one knows what the terms were.

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:10.150
And as a result, the patent troll can claim

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:13.150
that they won the case.

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:15.150
In the case of Gooseberry Natural Resources,

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.150
this patent on emailing news releases

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:19.150
had sort of a fatal flaw

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:21.150
as it pertained to myself,

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.150
and that was that in the mainstream media world

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:26.150
there is only one definition for news release,

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:28.150
and it turns out that is press release --

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:30.150
as in P.R.

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.150
Now my company, Fark,

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:34.150
deals with news, ostensibly,

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:36.150
and as a result

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.150
we were not in violation of this patent.

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:40.150
So case closed, right?

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:42.150
Wrong.

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.150
One of the major problems with patent law is that,

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:47.150
in the case that when you are sued by a patent troll,

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:50.150
the burden of proof that you did not infringe on the patent

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:52.150
is actually on the defendant,

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:54.150
which means you have to prove

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:57.150
that you do not infringe on the patent they're suing you on.

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:00.150
And this can take quite a while.

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:03.150
You need to know that the average patent troll defense

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:05.150
costs two million dollars

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:08.150
and takes 18 months when you win.

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:10.150
That is your best case outcome

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:12.150
when you get sued by a patent troll.

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:15.150
Now I had hoped to team up with some of these larger companies

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:17.150
in order to defend against this lawsuit,

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:20.150
but one-by-one they settled out of the case,

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:22.150
even though -- and this is important --

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:24.150
none of these companies

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:27.150
infringed on this patent -- not a one of them.

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:29.150
And they started settling out.

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:31.150
The reason they settled out

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:33.150
is because it's cheaper to settle than to fight the lawsuit --

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:36.150
clearly, two million dollars cheaper in some cases,

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:38.150
and much worse if you actually lose.

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:41.150
It would also constitute a massive distraction for management of a company,

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:44.150
especially a small eight-man shop like my company.

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:46.150
Six months into the lawsuit,

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:48.150
we finally reached the discovery phase.

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:50.150
And in discovery phase,

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:52.150
we asked the patent troll to please provide

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:54.150
screenshots of Fark

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:56.150
where the infringement of their patent

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:58.150
was actually occurring.

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:02.150
Now perhaps it's because no such screenshots actually existed,

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:04.150
but suddenly Gooseberry wanted to settle.

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:06.150
Their attorney:

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:10.150
"Ah, yes. My company's having a reorganization on our end."

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:12.150
Never mind the fact

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:14.150
that the address led to a strip mall somewhere in Northern L.A.

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:16.150
with no employees.

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:18.150
"And we'd like to go ahead and close this out.

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:22.150
So would you mind giving us your best and final offer?"

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:24.150
My response:

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:26.150
"How about nothing?!"

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:31.150
(Applause)

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:33.150
We didn't have high hopes for that outcome.

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:35.150
(Laughter)

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:37.150
But they settled.

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:39.150
No counter offer.

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:41.150
Now, as mentioned before,

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:43.150
one of the reasons I can talk to you about this

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:45.150
is because there's no non-disclosure agreement on this case.

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:47.150
Now how did that happen?

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:50.150
Well during the settlement process, when we received our copy, I struck it.

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:53.150
My attorney said, "Nah, no chance of that working."

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:55.150
It came back signed.

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:58.150
Now why? You can call them.

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:00.150
They're not under NDA either.

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:03.150
Now what did I learn from this case? Well, three things.

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:06.150
First of all, if you can,

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:09.150
don't fight the patent, fight the infringement.

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:11.150
Patents are very difficult to overturn.

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:14.150
Infringement is a lot easier to disprove.

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:16.150
Secondly, make it clear from the beginning

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:18.150
that either you have no money at all

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:22.150
or that you would rather spend money with your attorney fighting the troll

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:24.150
than actually giving them the money.

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:26.150
Now the reason this works

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:28.150
is because patent trolls

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:31.150
are paid a percentage of what they're able to recover in settlements.

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:34.150
If it becomes clear to them that they cannot recover any money,

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:37.150
they become less interested in pursuing the case.

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:39.150
Finally, make sure that you can tell them

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:41.150
that you will make this process

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:43.150
as annoying and as painful

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:46.150
and as difficult as possible for them.

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:48.150
Now this is a tactic that patent trolls are supposed to use on people

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:50.150
to get their way.

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:52.150
It turns out, because they're paid on contingency,

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:54.150
it works really, really well in reverse.

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:56.150
Don't forget that.

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:58.150
So what does all this mean?

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:00.150
Well to sum up,

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:02.150
it boils down to one thing:

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:05.150
Don't negotiate with terrorists.

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:10.150
(Applause)

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:13.150
Patent trolls have done more damage to the United States economy

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:15.150
than any domestic or foreign

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:18.150
terrorist organization in history

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:21.150
every year.

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:24.150
And what do they do with that money?

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:28.150
They plow it right back into filing more troll lawsuits.

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:30.150
Now this is the point in the Talk

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:33.150
where I'm supposed to come up with some kind of a solution for the patent system.

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:35.150
And the problem with that

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:37.150
is that there are two very large industry groups

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:39.150
that have different outcomes in mind

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:41.150
for the patent system.

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:43.150
The health care industry

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:45.150
would like stronger protections for inventors.

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:47.150
The hi-tech industry

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:49.150
would like stronger protections for producers.

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:52.150
And these goals aren't necessarily diametrically opposed, but they are at odds.

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:56.150
And as a result, patent trolls can kind of live in the space in between.

00:05:56.150 --> 00:05:58.150
So unfortunately I'm not smart enough

00:05:58.150 --> 00:06:01.150
to have a solution for the patent troll problem.

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:04.150
However, I did have this idea,

00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:07.150
and it was kind of good.

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:09.150
And I thought, "I should patent this."

00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:12.150
(Laughter)

00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:17.150
Behold, patent infringement via mobile device --

00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:21.150
defined as a computer which is not stationary.

00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:23.150
My solution: award me this patent

00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:25.150
and I will troll them out of existence.

00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:27.150
Thank you.

00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:31.150
(Applause)
