00:00:12.907 --> 00:00:16.394
Five hundred seventy-one million

00:00:16.394 --> 00:00:22.701
two hundred thirty thousand pounds of paper towels

00:00:22.701 --> 00:00:24.588
are used by Americans

00:00:24.588 --> 00:00:28.259
every year.

00:00:28.259 --> 00:00:31.314
If we could -- correction, wrong figure --

00:00:31.314 --> 00:00:33.665
13 billion used every year.

00:00:33.665 --> 00:00:36.768
If we could reduce the usage of paper towels,

00:00:36.768 --> 00:00:39.950
one paper towel per person per day,

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:46.831
571,230,000 pounds of paper not used.

00:00:46.831 --> 00:00:48.966
We can do that.

00:00:48.966 --> 00:00:52.896
Now there are all kinds of paper towel dispensers.

00:00:52.896 --> 00:00:57.127
There's the tri-fold. People typically take two or three.

00:00:57.127 --> 00:01:01.290
There's the one that cuts it, that you have to tear off.

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:03.554
People go one, two, three, four, tear.

00:01:03.554 --> 00:01:04.992
This much, right?

00:01:04.992 --> 00:01:07.457
There's the one that cuts itself.

00:01:07.457 --> 00:01:11.597
People go, one, two, three, four.

00:01:11.597 --> 00:01:15.672
Or there's the same thing, but recycled paper,

00:01:15.672 --> 00:01:20.185
you have to get five of those because they're not as absorbent, of course.

00:01:20.185 --> 00:01:26.706
The fact is, you can do it all with one towel.

00:01:26.706 --> 00:01:28.746
The key, two words:

00:01:28.746 --> 00:01:33.194
This half of the room, your word is "shake."

00:01:33.194 --> 00:01:35.376
Let's hear it. Shake. Louder.

00:01:35.376 --> 00:01:36.921
Audience: Shake.

00:01:36.921 --> 00:01:39.097
Joe Smith: Your word is "fold."

00:01:39.097 --> 00:01:40.213
Audience: Fold.

00:01:40.213 --> 00:01:41.140
JS: Again.

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:43.209
Audience: Fold. JS: Really loud.

00:01:43.209 --> 00:01:44.757
Audience: Shake. Fold.

00:01:44.757 --> 00:01:48.917
JS: OK. Wet hands.

00:01:48.917 --> 00:01:53.717
Shake -- one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12.

00:01:53.717 --> 00:01:56.655
Why 12? Twelve apostles, twelve tribes,

00:01:56.655 --> 00:02:00.762
twelve zodiac signs, twelve months. The one I like the best:

00:02:00.762 --> 00:02:02.959
It's the biggest number with one syllable.

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:07.221
(Laughter)

00:02:07.221 --> 00:02:14.581
Tri-fold. Fold ...

00:02:14.581 --> 00:02:16.133
Dry.

00:02:16.133 --> 00:02:20.365
(Applause)

00:02:20.365 --> 00:02:25.579
Audience: Shake.

00:02:25.579 --> 00:02:28.511
Fold.

00:02:28.511 --> 00:02:31.089
JS: Cuts itself. Fold. The fold is important

00:02:31.089 --> 00:02:35.971
because it allows interstitial suspension.

00:02:35.971 --> 00:02:38.449
You don't have to remember that part, but trust me.

00:02:38.449 --> 00:02:43.502
(Laughter)

00:02:43.502 --> 00:02:50.219
Audience: Shake. Fold.

00:02:50.219 --> 00:02:55.881
JS: Cuts itself.

00:02:55.881 --> 00:02:57.038
You know the funny thing is,

00:02:57.038 --> 00:02:59.213
I get my hands drier than people do with three or four,

00:02:59.213 --> 00:03:01.661
because they can't get in between the cracks.

00:03:01.661 --> 00:03:04.805
If you think this isn't as good...

00:03:04.805 --> 00:03:13.274
Audience: Shake. Fold.

00:03:13.274 --> 00:03:16.842
JS: Now, there's now a real fancy invention,

00:03:16.842 --> 00:03:19.249
it's the one where you wave your hand

00:03:19.249 --> 00:03:21.040
and it kicks it out.

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:23.126
It's way too big a towel.

00:03:23.126 --> 00:03:24.153
Let me tell you a secret.

00:03:24.153 --> 00:03:26.240
If you're really quick, if you're really quick --

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:27.820
and I can prove this --

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:32.669
this is half a towel from the dispenser in this building.

00:03:32.669 --> 00:03:36.036
How? As soon as it starts, you just tear it off.

00:03:36.036 --> 00:03:37.708
It's smart enough to stop.

00:03:37.708 --> 00:03:41.700
And you get half a towel.

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:54.977
Audience: Shake. Fold.

00:03:54.977 --> 00:04:01.811
JS: Now, let's all say it together. Shake. Fold.

00:04:01.811 --> 00:04:05.954
You will for the rest of your life remember those words

00:04:05.954 --> 00:04:08.937
every time you pick up a paper towel.

00:04:08.937 --> 00:04:14.025
And remember, one towel per person for one year --

00:04:14.025 --> 00:04:18.745
571,230,000 pounds of paper. No small thing.

00:04:18.745 --> 00:04:20.993
And next year, toilet paper.

00:04:20.993 --> 00:04:22.369
(Laughter)
