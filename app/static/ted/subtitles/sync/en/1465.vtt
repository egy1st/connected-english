WEBVTT

00:00:12.194 --> 00:00:13.187
Is E.T. out there?

00:00:13.187 --> 00:00:16.166
Well, I work at the SETI Institute.

00:00:16.166 --> 00:00:17.401
That's almost my name. SETI:

00:00:17.401 --> 00:00:19.808
Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence.

00:00:19.808 --> 00:00:21.427
In other words, I look for aliens,

00:00:21.427 --> 00:00:25.095
and when I tell people that at a cocktail party, they usually

00:00:25.095 --> 00:00:27.856
look at me with a mildly incredulous look on their face.

00:00:27.856 --> 00:00:30.189
I try to keep my own face somewhat dispassionate.

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:32.949
Now, a lot of people think that this is kind of idealistic,

00:00:32.949 --> 00:00:35.199
ridiculous, maybe even hopeless,

00:00:35.199 --> 00:00:38.904
but I just want to talk to you a little bit about why I think

00:00:38.904 --> 00:00:42.718
that the job I have is actually a privilege, okay,

00:00:42.718 --> 00:00:44.816
and give you a little bit of the motivation for my getting into

00:00:44.816 --> 00:00:47.171
this line of work, if that's what you call it.

00:00:47.171 --> 00:00:50.179
This thing — whoops, can we go back?

00:00:50.179 --> 00:00:52.878
Hello, come in, Earth.

00:00:52.878 --> 00:00:54.229
There we go. All right.

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:56.222
This is the Owens Valley Radio Observatory

00:00:56.222 --> 00:00:59.658
behind the Sierra Nevadas, and in 1968,

00:00:59.658 --> 00:01:02.567
I was working there collecting data for my thesis.

00:01:02.567 --> 00:01:05.908
Now, it's kinda lonely, it's kinda tedious, just collecting data,

00:01:05.908 --> 00:01:08.441
so I would amuse myself by taking photos at night

00:01:08.441 --> 00:01:11.202
of the telescopes or even of myself,

00:01:11.202 --> 00:01:16.436
because, you know, at night, I would be the only hominid

00:01:16.436 --> 00:01:18.184
within about 30 miles.

00:01:18.184 --> 00:01:20.193
So here are pictures of myself.

00:01:20.193 --> 00:01:23.781
The observatory had just acquired a new book,

00:01:23.781 --> 00:01:25.531
written by a Russian cosmologist

00:01:25.531 --> 00:01:29.149
by the name of Joseph Shklovsky, and then expanded

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:31.602
and translated and edited by a little-known

00:01:31.602 --> 00:01:34.211
Cornell astronomer by the name of Carl Sagan.

00:01:34.211 --> 00:01:36.208
And I remember reading that book,

00:01:36.208 --> 00:01:38.216
and at 3 in the morning I was reading this book

00:01:38.216 --> 00:01:40.909
and it was explaining how the antennas I was using

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:45.856
to measure the spins of galaxies could also be used

00:01:45.856 --> 00:01:48.168
to communicate, to send bits of information

00:01:48.168 --> 00:01:50.760
from one star system to another.

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:52.228
Now, at 3 o'clock in the morning when you're all alone,

00:01:52.228 --> 00:01:55.159
haven't had much sleep, that was a very romantic idea,

00:01:55.159 --> 00:01:59.048
but it was that idea -- the fact that you could in fact

00:01:59.048 --> 00:02:00.532
prove that there's somebody out there

00:02:00.532 --> 00:02:03.248
just using this same technology --

00:02:03.248 --> 00:02:05.478
that appealed to me so much that 20 years later I took a job

00:02:05.478 --> 00:02:07.451
at the SETI Institute. Now, I have to say

00:02:07.451 --> 00:02:11.901
that my memory is notoriously porous, and I've often

00:02:11.901 --> 00:02:13.734
wondered whether there was any truth in this story,

00:02:13.734 --> 00:02:15.238
or I was just, you know, misremembering something,

00:02:15.238 --> 00:02:17.986
but I recently just blew up this old negative of mine,

00:02:17.986 --> 00:02:19.585
and sure enough, there you can see

00:02:19.585 --> 00:02:21.696
the Shklovsky and Sagan book underneath that

00:02:21.696 --> 00:02:24.173
analog calculating device.

00:02:24.173 --> 00:02:25.076
So it was true.

00:02:25.076 --> 00:02:27.517
All right. Now, the idea for doing this, it wasn't very old

00:02:27.517 --> 00:02:29.181
at the time that I made that photo.

00:02:29.181 --> 00:02:32.659
The idea dates from 1960, when a young astronomer

00:02:32.659 --> 00:02:35.155
by the name of Frank Drake used this antenna

00:02:35.155 --> 00:02:38.765
in West Virginia, pointed it at a couple of nearby stars

00:02:38.765 --> 00:02:42.154
in the hopes of eavesdropping on E.T.

00:02:42.154 --> 00:02:43.750
Now, Frank didn't hear anything.

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:46.159
Actually he did, but it turned out to be the U.S. Air Force,

00:02:46.159 --> 00:02:49.124
which doesn't count as extraterrestrial intelligence.

00:02:49.124 --> 00:02:51.890
But Drake's idea here became very popular

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:54.347
because it was very appealing — and I'll get back to that —

00:02:54.347 --> 00:02:57.763
and on the basis of this experiment, which didn't succeed,

00:02:57.763 --> 00:02:59.618
we have been doing SETI ever since,

00:02:59.618 --> 00:03:01.652
not continuously, but ever since.

00:03:01.652 --> 00:03:03.538
We still haven't heard anything.

00:03:03.538 --> 00:03:05.216
We still haven't heard anything.

00:03:05.216 --> 00:03:07.009
In fact, we don't know about any life beyond Earth,

00:03:07.009 --> 00:03:09.809
but I'm going to suggest to you that that's going to change

00:03:09.809 --> 00:03:12.178
rather soon, and part of the reason, in fact,

00:03:12.178 --> 00:03:14.953
the majority of the reason why I think that's going to change

00:03:14.953 --> 00:03:16.218
is that the equipment's getting better.

00:03:16.218 --> 00:03:19.155
This is the Allen Telescope Array, about 350 miles

00:03:19.155 --> 00:03:21.171
from whatever seat you're in right now.

00:03:21.171 --> 00:03:23.176
This is something that we're using today

00:03:23.176 --> 00:03:25.180
to search for E.T., and the electronics have gotten

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:26.650
very much better too.

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:29.176
This is Frank Drake's electronics in 1960.

00:03:29.176 --> 00:03:31.197
This is the Allen Telescope Array electronics today.

00:03:31.197 --> 00:03:34.686
Some pundit with too much time on his hands

00:03:34.686 --> 00:03:37.693
has reckoned that the new experiments are approximately

00:03:37.693 --> 00:03:42.188
100 trillion times better than they were in 1960,

00:03:42.188 --> 00:03:43.684
100 trillion times better.

00:03:43.684 --> 00:03:45.773
That's a degree of an improvement that would look good

00:03:45.773 --> 00:03:48.180
on your report card, okay?

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:50.814
But something that's not appreciated by the public is,

00:03:50.814 --> 00:03:53.539
in fact, that the experiment continues to get better,

00:03:53.539 --> 00:03:56.187
and, consequently, tends to get faster.

00:03:56.187 --> 00:03:57.876
This is a little plot, and every time you show a plot,

00:03:57.876 --> 00:03:59.514
you lose 10 percent of the audience.

00:03:59.514 --> 00:04:01.823
I have 12 of these. (Laughter)

00:04:01.823 --> 00:04:06.243
But what I plotted here is just some metric

00:04:06.243 --> 00:04:08.797
that shows how fast we're searching.

00:04:08.797 --> 00:04:10.905
In other words, we're looking for a needle in a haystack.

00:04:10.905 --> 00:04:13.192
We know how big the haystack is. It's the galaxy.

00:04:13.192 --> 00:04:15.903
But we're going through the haystack no longer

00:04:15.903 --> 00:04:18.195
with a teaspoon but with a skip loader,

00:04:18.195 --> 00:04:20.166
because of this increase in speed.

00:04:20.166 --> 00:04:21.601
In fact, those of you who are still conscious

00:04:21.601 --> 00:04:24.161
and mathematically competent,

00:04:24.161 --> 00:04:26.239
will note that this is a semi-log plot.

00:04:26.239 --> 00:04:30.631
In other words, the rate of increase is exponential.

00:04:30.631 --> 00:04:33.364
It's exponentially improving. Now, exponential is an

00:04:33.364 --> 00:04:35.683
overworked word. You hear it on the media all the time.

00:04:35.683 --> 00:04:37.220
They don't really know what exponential means,

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:39.231
but this is exponential.

00:04:39.231 --> 00:04:42.151
In fact, it's doubling every 18 months, and, of course,

00:04:42.151 --> 00:04:44.155
every card-carrying member of the digerati knows

00:04:44.155 --> 00:04:45.647
that that's Moore's Law.

00:04:45.647 --> 00:04:48.248
So this means that over the course of the next

00:04:48.248 --> 00:04:52.160
two dozen years, we'll be able to look at a million star systems,

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:54.188
a million star systems, looking for signals

00:04:54.188 --> 00:04:55.697
that would prove somebody's out there.

00:04:55.697 --> 00:04:58.195
Well, a million star systems, is that interesting?

00:04:58.195 --> 00:05:01.209
I mean, how many of those star systems have planets?

00:05:01.209 --> 00:05:03.354
And the facts are, we didn't know the answer to that

00:05:03.354 --> 00:05:06.128
even as recently as 15 years ago, and in fact, we really

00:05:06.128 --> 00:05:08.651
didn't know it even as recently as six months ago.

00:05:08.651 --> 00:05:11.529
But now we do. Recent results suggest

00:05:11.529 --> 00:05:15.168
that virtually every star has planets, and more than one.

00:05:15.168 --> 00:05:18.494
They're like, you know, kittens. You get a litter.

00:05:18.494 --> 00:05:20.234
You don't get one kitten. You get a bunch.

00:05:20.234 --> 00:05:23.168
So in fact, this is a pretty accurate estimate

00:05:23.168 --> 00:05:27.164
of the number of planets in our galaxy,

00:05:27.164 --> 00:05:29.191
just in our galaxy, by the way,

00:05:29.191 --> 00:05:31.961
and I remind the non-astronomy majors among you

00:05:31.961 --> 00:05:34.206
that our galaxy is only one of 100 billion

00:05:34.206 --> 00:05:36.190
that we can see with our telescopes.

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:37.713
That's a lot of real estate, but of course,

00:05:37.713 --> 00:05:39.622
most of these planets are going to be kind of worthless,

00:05:39.622 --> 00:05:41.714
like, you know, Mercury, or Neptune.

00:05:41.714 --> 00:05:43.804
Neptune's probably not very big in your life.

00:05:43.804 --> 00:05:48.151
So the question is, what fraction of these planets

00:05:48.151 --> 00:05:49.833
are actually suitable for life?

00:05:49.833 --> 00:05:51.238
We don't know the answer to that either,

00:05:51.238 --> 00:05:53.476
but we will learn that answer this year, thanks to

00:05:53.476 --> 00:05:55.232
NASA's Kepler Space Telescope,

00:05:55.232 --> 00:05:59.254
and in fact, the smart money, which is to say the people who work on this project,

00:05:59.254 --> 00:06:02.683
the smart money is suggesting that the fraction of planets

00:06:02.683 --> 00:06:06.719
that might be suitable for life is maybe one in a thousand,

00:06:06.719 --> 00:06:10.026
one in a hundred, something like that.

00:06:10.026 --> 00:06:12.166
Well, even taking the pessimistic estimate, that it's

00:06:12.166 --> 00:06:15.277
one in a thousand, that means that there are

00:06:15.277 --> 00:06:17.806
at least a billion cousins of the Earth

00:06:17.806 --> 00:06:19.533
just in our own galaxy.

00:06:19.533 --> 00:06:21.786
Okay, now I've given you a lot of numbers here,

00:06:21.786 --> 00:06:25.712
but they're mostly big numbers, okay, so, you know,

00:06:25.712 --> 00:06:28.191
keep that in mind. There's plenty of real estate,

00:06:28.191 --> 00:06:30.204
plenty of real estate in the universe,

00:06:30.204 --> 00:06:33.153
and if we're the only bit of real estate in which there's

00:06:33.153 --> 00:06:36.188
some interesting occupants, that makes you a miracle,

00:06:36.188 --> 00:06:38.869
and I know you like to think you're a miracle,

00:06:38.869 --> 00:06:40.779
but if you do science, you learn rather quickly that

00:06:40.779 --> 00:06:42.662
every time you think you're a miracle, you're wrong,

00:06:42.662 --> 00:06:45.190
so probably not the case.

00:06:45.190 --> 00:06:47.241
All right, so the bottom line is this:

00:06:47.241 --> 00:06:50.204
Because of the increase in speed, and because of the

00:06:50.204 --> 00:06:55.155
vast amount of habitable real estate in the cosmos, I figure

00:06:55.155 --> 00:06:57.200
we're going to pick up a signal within two dozen years.

00:06:57.200 --> 00:07:00.171
And I feel strongly enough about that to make a bet with you:

00:07:00.171 --> 00:07:02.608
Either we're going to find E.T. in the next two dozen years,

00:07:02.608 --> 00:07:06.226
or I'll buy you a cup of coffee.

00:07:06.226 --> 00:07:08.860
So that's not so bad. I mean, even with two dozen years,

00:07:08.860 --> 00:07:10.719
you open up your browser and there's news of a signal,

00:07:10.719 --> 00:07:12.470
or you get a cup of coffee.

00:07:12.470 --> 00:07:16.443
Now, let me tell you about some aspect of this that

00:07:16.443 --> 00:07:18.481
people don't think about, and that is,

00:07:18.481 --> 00:07:22.189
what happens? Suppose that what I say is true.

00:07:22.189 --> 00:07:24.554
I mean, who knows, but suppose it happens.

00:07:24.554 --> 00:07:26.041
Suppose some time in the next two dozen years

00:07:26.041 --> 00:07:28.218
we pick up a faint line that tells us

00:07:28.218 --> 00:07:29.906
we have some cosmic company.

00:07:29.906 --> 00:07:32.201
What is the effect? What's the consequence?

00:07:32.201 --> 00:07:34.165
Now, I might be at ground zero for this.

00:07:34.165 --> 00:07:35.986
I happen to know what the consequence for me would be,

00:07:35.986 --> 00:07:38.895
because we've had false alarms. This is 1997,

00:07:38.910 --> 00:07:41.194
and this is a photo I made at about 3 o'clock in the morning

00:07:41.194 --> 00:07:43.203
in Mountain View here, when we were watching

00:07:43.203 --> 00:07:45.518
the computer monitors because we had picked up a signal

00:07:45.518 --> 00:07:48.596
that we thought, "This is the real deal." All right?

00:07:48.596 --> 00:07:51.964
And I kept waiting for the Men in Black to show up. Right?

00:07:51.964 --> 00:07:56.167
I kept waiting for -- I kept waiting for my mom to call,

00:07:56.167 --> 00:07:59.171
somebody to call, the government to call. Nobody called.

00:07:59.171 --> 00:08:02.341
Nobody called. I was so nervous

00:08:02.341 --> 00:08:04.165
that I couldn't sit down. I just wandered around

00:08:04.165 --> 00:08:07.155
taking photos like this one, just for something to do.

00:08:07.155 --> 00:08:09.189
Well, at 9:30 in the morning, with my head down

00:08:09.189 --> 00:08:11.219
on my desk because I obviously hadn't slept all night,

00:08:11.219 --> 00:08:13.556
the phone rings and it's The New York Times.

00:08:13.556 --> 00:08:16.182
And I think there's a lesson in that, and that lesson is

00:08:16.182 --> 00:08:19.162
that if we pick up a signal, the media, the media will be on it

00:08:19.162 --> 00:08:23.496
faster than a weasel on ball bearings. It's going to be fast.

00:08:23.496 --> 00:08:25.174
You can be sure of that. No secrecy.

00:08:25.174 --> 00:08:28.157
That's what happens to me. It kind of ruins my whole week,

00:08:28.157 --> 00:08:30.780
because whatever I've got planned that week is kind of out the window.

00:08:30.780 --> 00:08:33.200
But what about you? What's it going to do to you?

00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:35.207
And the answer is that we don't know the answer.

00:08:35.207 --> 00:08:36.092
We don't know what that's going to do to you,

00:08:36.092 --> 00:08:39.216
not in the long term, and not even very much in the short term.

00:08:39.216 --> 00:08:42.044
I mean, that would be a bit like

00:08:42.044 --> 00:08:45.150
asking Chris Columbus in 1491, "Hey Chris,

00:08:45.150 --> 00:08:47.164
you know, what happens if it turns out that there's a

00:08:47.164 --> 00:08:50.700
continent between here and Japan, where you're sailing to,

00:08:50.700 --> 00:08:53.475
what will be the consequences for humanity

00:08:53.475 --> 00:08:55.221
if that turns out to be the case?"

00:08:55.221 --> 00:08:57.451
And I think Chris would probably offer you some answer

00:08:57.451 --> 00:09:00.162
that you might not have understood, but it probably

00:09:00.162 --> 00:09:02.996
wouldn't have been right, and I think that to predict

00:09:02.996 --> 00:09:04.755
what finding E.T.'s going to mean,

00:09:04.755 --> 00:09:05.835
we can't predict that either.

00:09:05.835 --> 00:09:07.457
But here are a couple things I can say.

00:09:07.457 --> 00:09:11.614
To begin with, it's going to be a society that's way in advance of our own.

00:09:11.614 --> 00:09:13.238
You're not going to hear from alien Neanderthals.

00:09:13.238 --> 00:09:14.528
They're not building transmitters.

00:09:14.528 --> 00:09:16.454
They're going to be ahead of us, maybe by a few thousand

00:09:16.454 --> 00:09:19.521
years, maybe by a few millions years, but substantially

00:09:19.521 --> 00:09:21.750
ahead of us, and that means, if you can understand

00:09:21.750 --> 00:09:25.536
anything that they're going to say, then you might be able

00:09:25.536 --> 00:09:28.626
to short-circuit history by getting information from a society

00:09:28.626 --> 00:09:30.200
that's way beyond our own.

00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:33.151
Now, you might find that a bit hyperbolic, and maybe it is,

00:09:33.151 --> 00:09:35.804
but nonetheless, it's conceivable that this will happen,

00:09:35.804 --> 00:09:38.177
and, you know, you could consider this like, I don't know,

00:09:38.177 --> 00:09:40.646
giving Julius Caesar English lessons and the key

00:09:40.646 --> 00:09:41.753
to the library of Congress.

00:09:41.753 --> 00:09:44.208
It would change his day, all right?

00:09:44.208 --> 00:09:46.203
That's one thing. Another thing that's for sure

00:09:46.203 --> 00:09:49.703
going to happen is that it will calibrate us.

00:09:49.703 --> 00:09:53.641
We will know that we're not that miracle, right,

00:09:53.641 --> 00:09:55.203
that we're just another duck in a row,

00:09:55.203 --> 00:09:57.198
we're not the only kids on the block, and I think that that's

00:09:57.198 --> 00:10:00.152
philosophically a very profound thing to learn.

00:10:00.152 --> 00:10:03.253
We're not a miracle, okay?

00:10:03.253 --> 00:10:06.552
The third thing that it might tell you is somewhat vague,

00:10:06.552 --> 00:10:08.675
but I think interesting and important,

00:10:08.675 --> 00:10:10.780
and that is, if you find a signal coming from a more

00:10:10.780 --> 00:10:13.011
advanced society, because they will be,

00:10:13.011 --> 00:10:15.663
that will tell you something about our own possibilities,

00:10:15.663 --> 00:10:20.445
that we're not inevitably doomed to self-destruction.

00:10:20.445 --> 00:10:22.241
Because they survived their technology,

00:10:22.241 --> 00:10:23.353
we could do it too.

00:10:23.353 --> 00:10:25.244
Normally when you look out into the universe,

00:10:25.244 --> 00:10:27.705
you're looking back in time. All right?

00:10:27.705 --> 00:10:29.744
That's interesting to cosmologists.

00:10:29.744 --> 00:10:33.188
But in this sense, you actually can look into the future,

00:10:33.188 --> 00:10:35.203
hazily, but you can look into the future.

00:10:35.203 --> 00:10:40.740
So those are all the sorts of things that would come from a detection.

00:10:40.740 --> 00:10:43.172
Now, let me talk a little bit about something that happens

00:10:43.172 --> 00:10:47.384
even in the meantime, and that is,

00:10:47.384 --> 00:10:52.162
SETI, I think, is important, because it's exploration, and

00:10:52.162 --> 00:10:54.614
it's not only exploration, it's comprehensible exploration.

00:10:54.614 --> 00:10:57.479
Now, I gotta tell you, I'm always reading books about

00:10:57.479 --> 00:11:00.194
explorers. I find exploration very interesting,

00:11:00.194 --> 00:11:03.175
Arctic exploration, you know, people like Magellan,

00:11:03.175 --> 00:11:06.171
Amundsen, Shackleton, you see Franklin down there,

00:11:06.171 --> 00:11:09.495
Scott, all these guys. It's really nifty, exploration.

00:11:09.495 --> 00:11:11.734
And they're just doing it because they want to explore,

00:11:11.734 --> 00:11:13.850
and you might say, "Oh, that's kind of a frivolous opportunity,"

00:11:13.850 --> 00:11:17.178
but that's not frivolous. That's not a frivolous activity,

00:11:17.178 --> 00:11:19.209
because, I mean, think of ants.

00:11:19.209 --> 00:11:21.206
You know, most ants are programmed to follow one another

00:11:21.206 --> 00:11:23.454
along in a long line, but there are a couple of ants,

00:11:23.454 --> 00:11:26.150
maybe one percent of those ants, that are what they call

00:11:26.150 --> 00:11:28.325
pioneer ants, and they're the ones that wander off.

00:11:28.325 --> 00:11:30.226
They're the ones you find on the kitchen countertop.

00:11:30.226 --> 00:11:32.224
You gotta get them with your thumb before they

00:11:32.224 --> 00:11:33.808
find the sugar or something.

00:11:33.808 --> 00:11:36.213
But those ants, even though most of them get wiped out,

00:11:36.213 --> 00:11:39.505
those ants are the ones that are essential to the survival

00:11:39.505 --> 00:11:43.079
of the hive. So exploration is important.

00:11:43.079 --> 00:11:46.459
I also think that exploration is important in terms of

00:11:46.459 --> 00:11:51.329
being able to address what I think is a critical

00:11:51.329 --> 00:11:54.530
lack in our society, and that is the lack of science literacy,

00:11:54.530 --> 00:11:58.173
the lack of the ability to even understand science.

00:11:58.173 --> 00:12:00.215
Now, look, a lot has been written about the

00:12:00.215 --> 00:12:03.613
deplorable state of science literacy in this country.

00:12:03.613 --> 00:12:06.165
You've heard about it.

00:12:06.165 --> 00:12:08.217
Well, here's one example, in fact.

00:12:08.217 --> 00:12:10.536
Polls taken, this poll was taken 10 years ago.

00:12:10.536 --> 00:12:12.665
It shows like roughly one third of the public thinks

00:12:12.665 --> 00:12:14.629
that aliens are not only out there, we're looking for them

00:12:14.629 --> 00:12:16.247
out there, but they're here, right?

00:12:16.247 --> 00:12:18.546
Sailing the skies in their saucers and occasionally

00:12:18.546 --> 00:12:21.662
abducting people for experiments their parents wouldn't approve of.

00:12:21.662 --> 00:12:24.835
Well, that would be interesting if it was true,

00:12:24.835 --> 00:12:26.714
and job security for me, but I don't think the evidence is

00:12:26.714 --> 00:12:30.186
very good. That's more, you know, sad than significant.

00:12:30.186 --> 00:12:32.205
But there are other things that people believe

00:12:32.205 --> 00:12:35.616
that are significant, like the efficacy of homeopathy,

00:12:35.616 --> 00:12:39.167
or that evolution is just, you know, sort of a crazy idea

00:12:39.167 --> 00:12:42.198
by scientists without any legs, or, you know, evolution,

00:12:42.198 --> 00:12:44.754
all that sort of thing, or global warming.

00:12:44.754 --> 00:12:48.155
These sorts of ideas don't really have any validity,

00:12:48.155 --> 00:12:50.230
that you can't trust the scientists.

00:12:50.230 --> 00:12:52.473
Now, we've got to solve that problem, because that's

00:12:52.473 --> 00:12:56.551
a critically important problem, and you might say,

00:12:56.551 --> 00:12:59.180
"Well, okay, how are we gonna solve that problem with SETI?"

00:12:59.180 --> 00:13:01.579
Well, let me suggest to you that SETI obviously can't

00:13:01.579 --> 00:13:03.242
solve the problem, but it can address the problem.

00:13:03.242 --> 00:13:06.185
It can address the problem by getting young people

00:13:06.185 --> 00:13:09.183
interested in science. Look, science is hard, it

00:13:09.183 --> 00:13:12.236
has a reputation of being hard, and the facts are, it is hard,

00:13:12.236 --> 00:13:17.171
and that's the result of 400 years of science, right?

00:13:17.171 --> 00:13:19.650
I mean, in the 18th century, in the 18th century

00:13:19.650 --> 00:13:22.240
you could become an expert on any field of science

00:13:22.240 --> 00:13:25.154
in an afternoon by going to a library,

00:13:25.154 --> 00:13:27.175
if you could find the library, right?

00:13:27.175 --> 00:13:30.791
In the 19th century, if you had a basement lab,

00:13:30.791 --> 00:13:33.538
you could make major scientific discoveries

00:13:33.538 --> 00:13:35.763
in your own home. Right? Because there was all this

00:13:35.763 --> 00:13:38.638
science just lying around waiting for somebody to pick it up.

00:13:38.638 --> 00:13:40.231
Now, that's not true anymore.

00:13:40.231 --> 00:13:42.659
Today, you've got to spend years in grad school

00:13:42.659 --> 00:13:46.157
and post-doc positions just to figure out what

00:13:46.157 --> 00:13:48.213
the important questions are.

00:13:48.213 --> 00:13:50.208
It's hard. There's no doubt about it.

00:13:50.208 --> 00:13:52.517
And in fact, here's an example: the Higgs boson,

00:13:52.517 --> 00:13:54.426
finding the Higgs boson.

00:13:54.426 --> 00:13:56.226
Ask the next 10 people you see on the streets,

00:13:56.226 --> 00:13:58.564
"Hey, do you think it's worthwhile to spend billions

00:13:58.564 --> 00:14:01.205
of Swiss francs looking for the Higgs boson?"

00:14:01.205 --> 00:14:03.526
And I bet the answer you're going to get, is,

00:14:03.526 --> 00:14:05.183
"Well, I don't know what the Higgs boson is,

00:14:05.183 --> 00:14:06.415
and I don't know if it's important."

00:14:06.415 --> 00:14:08.214
And probably most of the people wouldn't even know

00:14:08.214 --> 00:14:10.661
the value of a Swiss franc, okay?

00:14:10.661 --> 00:14:13.191
And yet we're spending billions of Swiss francs on this problem.

00:14:13.191 --> 00:14:15.344
Okay? So that doesn't get people interested in science

00:14:15.344 --> 00:14:17.220
because they can't comprehend what it's about.

00:14:17.220 --> 00:14:18.837
SETI, on the other hand, is really simple.

00:14:18.837 --> 00:14:20.453
We're going to use these big antennas and we're going to

00:14:20.453 --> 00:14:23.205
try to eavesdrop on signals. Everybody can understand that.

00:14:23.205 --> 00:14:25.214
Yes, technologically, it's very sophisticated,

00:14:25.214 --> 00:14:27.220
but everybody gets the idea.

00:14:27.220 --> 00:14:31.158
So that's one thing. The other thing is, it's exciting science.

00:14:31.158 --> 00:14:33.572
It's exciting because we're naturally interested

00:14:33.572 --> 00:14:35.797
in other intelligent beings, and I think that's

00:14:35.797 --> 00:14:37.221
part of our hardwiring.

00:14:37.221 --> 00:14:38.781
I mean, we're hardwired to be interested

00:14:38.781 --> 00:14:41.582
in beings that might be, if you will, competitors,

00:14:41.582 --> 00:14:45.165
or if you're the romantic sort, possibly even mates. Okay?

00:14:45.165 --> 00:14:47.176
I mean, this is analogous to our interest in things that

00:14:47.176 --> 00:14:49.197
have big teeth. Right?

00:14:49.197 --> 00:14:50.671
We're interested in things that have big teeth, and you

00:14:50.671 --> 00:14:53.216
can see the evolutionary value of that, and you can also see

00:14:53.216 --> 00:14:56.904
the practical consequences by watching Animal Planet.

00:14:56.904 --> 00:14:59.238
You notice they make very few programs about gerbils.

00:14:59.238 --> 00:15:01.294
It's mostly about things that have big teeth.

00:15:01.294 --> 00:15:04.241
Okay, so we're interested in these sorts of things.

00:15:04.241 --> 00:15:08.176
And not just us. It's also kids.

00:15:08.176 --> 00:15:11.603
This allows you to pay it forward by using this subject as a

00:15:11.603 --> 00:15:14.835
hook to science, because SETI involves all kinds of science,

00:15:14.835 --> 00:15:16.825
obviously biology, obviously astronomy,

00:15:16.825 --> 00:15:20.159
but also geology, also chemistry, various scientific

00:15:20.159 --> 00:15:24.159
disciplines all can be presented in the guise of,

00:15:24.159 --> 00:15:25.488
"We're looking for E.T."

00:15:25.488 --> 00:15:29.945
So to me this is interesting and important, and in fact,

00:15:29.945 --> 00:15:33.183
it's my policy, even though I give a lot of talks to adults,

00:15:33.183 --> 00:15:35.851
you give talks to adults, and two days later they're back where they were.

00:15:35.851 --> 00:15:38.773
But if you give talks to kids, you know,

00:15:38.773 --> 00:15:42.925
one in 50 of them, some light bulb goes off, and they think,

00:15:42.925 --> 00:15:44.726
"Gee, I'd never thought of that," and then they go,

00:15:44.726 --> 00:15:46.518
you know, read a book or a magazine or whatever.

00:15:46.518 --> 00:15:48.200
They get interested in something.

00:15:48.200 --> 00:15:53.174
Now it's my theory, supported only by anecdotal,

00:15:53.174 --> 00:15:55.197
personal anecdotal evidence, but nonetheless,

00:15:55.197 --> 00:15:57.670
that kids get interested in something between the ages

00:15:57.670 --> 00:16:00.206
of eight and 11. You've got to get them there.

00:16:00.206 --> 00:16:02.826
So, all right, I give talks to adults, that's fine, but I try

00:16:02.826 --> 00:16:05.151
and make 10 percent of the talks that I give,

00:16:05.151 --> 00:16:07.228
I try and make those for kids.

00:16:07.228 --> 00:16:10.204
I remember when a guy came to our high school, actually,

00:16:10.204 --> 00:16:13.180
it was actually my junior high school. I was in sixth grade.

00:16:13.180 --> 00:16:15.660
And he gave some talk. All I remember from it

00:16:15.660 --> 00:16:17.235
was one word: electronics.

00:16:17.235 --> 00:16:19.796
It was like Dustin Hoffman in "The Graduate," right,

00:16:19.796 --> 00:16:22.194
when he said "plastics," whatever that means, plastics.

00:16:22.194 --> 00:16:24.189
All right, so the guy said electronics. I don't remember

00:16:24.189 --> 00:16:26.193
anything else. In fact, I don't remember anything

00:16:26.193 --> 00:16:28.203
that my sixth grade teacher said all year,

00:16:28.203 --> 00:16:30.217
but I remember electronics.

00:16:30.217 --> 00:16:32.869
And so I got interested in electronics, and you know,

00:16:32.869 --> 00:16:35.194
I studied to get my ham license. I was wiring up stuff.

00:16:35.194 --> 00:16:38.172
Here I am at about 15 or something, doing that sort of stuff.

00:16:38.172 --> 00:16:39.755
Okay? That had a big effect on me.

00:16:39.755 --> 00:16:41.467
So that's my point, that you can have a big effect

00:16:41.467 --> 00:16:44.183
on these kids.

00:16:44.183 --> 00:16:47.844
In fact, this reminds me, I don't know, a couple years ago

00:16:47.844 --> 00:16:51.170
I gave a talk at a school in Palo Alto

00:16:51.170 --> 00:16:53.183
where there were about a dozen 11-year-olds

00:16:53.183 --> 00:16:54.155
that had come to this talk.

00:16:54.155 --> 00:16:56.671
I had been brought in to talk to these kids for an hour.

00:16:56.671 --> 00:16:58.945
Eleven-year-olds, they're all sitting in a little semi-circle

00:16:58.945 --> 00:17:01.189
looking up at me with big eyes, and I started,

00:17:01.189 --> 00:17:02.845
there was a white board behind me, and I started off

00:17:02.845 --> 00:17:05.683
by writing a one with 22 zeroes after it, and I said,

00:17:05.683 --> 00:17:08.046
"All right, now look, this is the number of stars

00:17:08.046 --> 00:17:10.918
in the visible universe, and this number is so big

00:17:10.918 --> 00:17:14.266
there's not even a name for it."

00:17:14.266 --> 00:17:16.731
And one of these kids shot up his hand, and he said,

00:17:16.731 --> 00:17:18.236
"Well, actually there is a name for it.

00:17:18.236 --> 00:17:21.170
It's a sextra-quadra-hexa-something or other." Right?

00:17:21.170 --> 00:17:25.166
Now, that kid was wrong by four orders of magnitude,

00:17:25.166 --> 00:17:27.638
but there was no doubt about it, these kids were smart.

00:17:27.638 --> 00:17:29.606
Okay? So I stopped giving the lecture.

00:17:29.606 --> 00:17:32.189
All they wanted to do was ask questions.

00:17:32.189 --> 00:17:36.181
In fact, my last comments to these kids, at the end I said,

00:17:36.181 --> 00:17:38.213
"You know, you kids are smarter

00:17:38.213 --> 00:17:43.155
than the people I work with." Now — (Laughter)

00:17:43.155 --> 00:17:44.484
They didn't even care about that.

00:17:44.484 --> 00:17:47.178
What they wanted was my email address

00:17:47.178 --> 00:17:51.163
so they could ask me more questions. (Laughter)

00:17:51.163 --> 00:17:54.322
Let me just say, look, my job is a privilege

00:17:54.322 --> 00:17:55.945
because we're in a special time.

00:17:55.945 --> 00:17:58.730
Previous generations couldn't do this experiment at all.

00:17:58.730 --> 00:18:00.555
In another generation down the line,

00:18:00.555 --> 00:18:02.171
I think we will have succeeded.

00:18:02.171 --> 00:18:05.652
So to me, it is a privilege, and when I look in the mirror,

00:18:05.652 --> 00:18:08.459
the facts are that I really don't see myself.

00:18:08.459 --> 00:18:10.223
What I see is the generation behind me.

00:18:10.223 --> 00:18:12.249
These are some kids from the Huff School, fourth graders.

00:18:12.249 --> 00:18:15.194
I talked there, what, two weeks ago, something like that.

00:18:15.194 --> 00:18:19.804
I think that if you can instill some interest in science

00:18:19.804 --> 00:18:22.763
and how it works, well, that's a payoff

00:18:22.763 --> 00:18:25.206
beyond easy measure. Thank you very much.

00:18:25.206 --> 00:18:31.197
(Applause)
