00:00:12.462 --> 00:00:14.600
I collaborate with bacteria.

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:15.482
And I'm about to show you

00:00:15.482 --> 00:00:17.662
some stop-motion footage that I made recently

00:00:17.662 --> 00:00:19.896
where you'll see bacteria accumulating minerals

00:00:19.896 --> 00:00:21.446
from their environment

00:00:21.446 --> 00:00:23.380
over the period of an hour.

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:24.745
So what you're seeing here

00:00:24.745 --> 00:00:26.963
is the bacteria metabolizing,

00:00:26.963 --> 00:00:28.162
and as they do so

00:00:28.162 --> 00:00:29.768
they create an electrical charge.

00:00:29.768 --> 00:00:32.101
And this attracts metals

00:00:32.101 --> 00:00:34.268
from their local environment.

00:00:34.268 --> 00:00:37.185
And these metals accumulate as minerals

00:00:37.185 --> 00:00:39.102
on the surface of the bacteria.

00:00:39.102 --> 00:00:41.269
One of the most pervasive problems

00:00:41.269 --> 00:00:43.018
in the world today for people

00:00:43.018 --> 00:00:44.435
is inadequate access

00:00:44.435 --> 00:00:46.186
to clean drinking water.

00:00:46.186 --> 00:00:47.852
And the desalination process

00:00:47.852 --> 00:00:49.636
is one where we take out salts.

00:00:49.636 --> 00:00:52.151
We can use it for drinking and agriculture.

00:00:52.151 --> 00:00:54.236
Removing the salts from water --

00:00:54.236 --> 00:00:55.497
particularly seawater --

00:00:55.497 --> 00:00:57.101
through reverse osmosis

00:00:57.101 --> 00:00:58.419
is a critical technique

00:00:58.419 --> 00:01:01.651
for countries who do not have access to clean drinking water

00:01:01.651 --> 00:01:02.770
around the globe.

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:04.234
So seawater reverse osmosis

00:01:04.234 --> 00:01:06.401
is a membrane-filtration technology.

00:01:06.401 --> 00:01:08.971
We take the water from the sea

00:01:08.971 --> 00:01:10.502
and we apply pressure.

00:01:10.502 --> 00:01:13.426
And this pressure forces the seawater

00:01:13.426 --> 00:01:14.726
through a membrane.

00:01:14.726 --> 00:01:16.161
This takes energy,

00:01:16.161 --> 00:01:18.693
producing clean water.

00:01:18.693 --> 00:01:22.394
But we're also left with a concentrated salt solution, or brine.

00:01:22.394 --> 00:01:23.807
But the process is very expensive

00:01:23.807 --> 00:01:26.441
and it's cost-prohibitive for many countries around the globe.

00:01:26.441 --> 00:01:28.223
And also, the brine that's produced

00:01:28.223 --> 00:01:31.107
is oftentimes just pumped back out into the sea.

00:01:31.107 --> 00:01:33.655
And this is detrimental to the local ecology

00:01:33.655 --> 00:01:36.090
of the sea area that it's pumped back out into.

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.106
So I work in Singapore at the moment,

00:01:38.106 --> 00:01:40.873
and this is a place that's really a leading place

00:01:40.873 --> 00:01:42.874
for desalination technology.

00:01:42.874 --> 00:01:45.424
And Singapore proposes by 2060

00:01:45.424 --> 00:01:48.523
to produce [900] million liters per day

00:01:48.523 --> 00:01:50.356
of desalinated water.

00:01:50.356 --> 00:01:53.706
But this will produce an equally massive amount

00:01:53.706 --> 00:01:55.459
of desalination brine.

00:01:55.459 --> 00:01:58.657
And this is where my collaboration with bacteria comes into play.

00:01:58.657 --> 00:02:00.606
So what we're doing at the moment

00:02:00.606 --> 00:02:03.272
is we're accumulating metals

00:02:03.272 --> 00:02:05.256
like calcium, potassium and magnesium

00:02:05.256 --> 00:02:07.490
from out of desalination brine.

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:09.772
And this, in terms of magnesium

00:02:09.772 --> 00:02:12.322
and the amount of water that I just mentioned,

00:02:12.322 --> 00:02:15.272
equates to a $4.5 billion

00:02:15.272 --> 00:02:17.671
mining industry for Singapore --

00:02:17.687 --> 00:02:20.221
a place that doesn't have any natural resources.

00:02:20.221 --> 00:02:22.871
So I'd like you to image a mining industry

00:02:22.871 --> 00:02:24.960
in a way that one hasn't existed before;

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:27.126
imagine a mining industry

00:02:27.126 --> 00:02:29.393
that doesn't mean defiling the Earth;

00:02:29.393 --> 00:02:31.504
imagine bacteria helping us do this

00:02:31.504 --> 00:02:34.976
by accumulating and precipitating

00:02:34.976 --> 00:02:37.393
and sedimenting minerals

00:02:37.393 --> 00:02:39.242
out of desalination brine.

00:02:39.242 --> 00:02:40.660
And what you can see here

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:43.142
is the beginning of an industry in a test tube,

00:02:43.142 --> 00:02:46.492
a mining industry that is in harmony with nature.

00:02:46.492 --> 00:02:47.843
Thank you.

00:02:47.843 --> 00:02:51.475
