00:00:12.622 --> 00:00:16.317
Those of you who have seen the film "Moneyball,"

00:00:16.317 --> 00:00:18.301
or have read the book by Michael Lewis,

00:00:18.301 --> 00:00:21.437
will be familiar with the story of Billy Beane.

00:00:21.437 --> 00:00:26.125
Billy was supposed to be a tremendous ballplayer; all the scouts told him so.

00:00:26.125 --> 00:00:27.318
They told his parents that

00:00:27.318 --> 00:00:29.357
they predicted that he was going to be a star.

00:00:29.357 --> 00:00:34.309
But what actually happened when he signed the contract -- and by the way, he didn't

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:36.733
want to sign that contract, he wanted to go to
college --

00:00:36.733 --> 00:00:39.390
which is what my mother, who actually does
love me,

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.254
said that I should do too, and I did --

00:00:42.254 --> 00:00:45.328
well, he didn't do very well. He struggled
mightily.

00:00:45.328 --> 00:00:49.861
He got traded a couple of times, he ended up in the Minors for most of his career,

00:00:49.861 --> 00:00:53.949
and he actually ended up in management. He ended up as a General Manager of the

00:00:53.949 --> 00:00:54.598
Oakland A's.

00:00:54.598 --> 00:00:59.022
Now for many of you in this room, ending up in management, which is also what I've done,

00:00:59.022 --> 00:01:00.718
is seen as a success.

00:01:00.718 --> 00:01:03.920
I can assure you that for a kid trying to make it in the Bigs,

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:08.629
going into management ain't no success story. It's a failure.

00:01:08.629 --> 00:01:13.068
And what I want to talk to you about today, and share with you, is that our

00:01:13.068 --> 00:01:17.508
healthcare system, our medical system, is
just as bad at predicting

00:01:17.508 --> 00:01:21.700
what happens to people in it -- patients,
others --

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:26.313
as those scouts were at predicting what would happen to Billy Beane.

00:01:26.313 --> 00:01:28.994
And yet, every day

00:01:28.994 --> 00:01:30.955
thousands of people in this country

00:01:30.955 --> 00:01:34.881
are diagnosed with preconditions.

00:01:34.881 --> 00:01:39.121
We hear about pre-hypertension, we hear about pre-dementia,

00:01:39.121 --> 00:01:44.457
we hear about pre-anxiety, and I'm pretty sure that I diagnosed myself with

00:01:44.457 --> 00:01:45.834
that in the green room.

00:01:45.834 --> 00:01:50.187
We also refer to subclinical conditions.

00:01:50.187 --> 00:01:54.738
There's subclinical atherosclerosis, subclinical hardening of the arteries,

00:01:54.738 --> 00:01:58.273
obviously linked to heart attacks, potentially.

00:01:58.273 --> 00:02:01.706
One of my favorites is called
subclinical acne.

00:02:01.706 --> 00:02:05.673
If you look up subclinical acne, you may find a website, which I did,

00:02:05.673 --> 00:02:09.802
which says that this is the easiest type of acne to treat.

00:02:09.802 --> 00:02:16.417
You don't have the pustules or the redness and inflammation.

00:02:16.417 --> 00:02:20.073
Maybe that's because you don't actually
have acne.

00:02:20.073 --> 00:02:26.596
I have a name for all of these conditions, it's another precondition:

00:02:26.596 --> 00:02:28.451
I call them preposterous.

00:02:28.451 --> 00:02:34.510
In baseball, the game follows the pre-game.

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:36.915
Season follows the pre-season.

00:02:36.915 --> 00:02:41.438
But with a lot of these conditions, that actually isn't the case, or at least it isn't the

00:02:41.438 --> 00:02:46.011
case all the time. It's as if there's a rain delay, every single time in many cases.

00:02:46.011 --> 00:02:47.829
We have pre-cancerous lesions,

00:02:47.829 --> 00:02:51.322
which often don't turn into cancer.

00:02:51.322 --> 00:02:53.178
And yet,

00:02:53.178 --> 00:02:57.104
if you take, for example, subclinical
osteoporosis, a bone thinning disease,

00:02:57.104 --> 00:02:58.757
the precondition,

00:02:58.757 --> 00:03:01.164
otherwise known as osteopenia,

00:03:01.164 --> 00:03:04.834
you would have to treat 270
women for three years

00:03:04.834 --> 00:03:07.034
in order to prevent one broken bone.

00:03:07.034 --> 00:03:08.643
That's an awful lot of women

00:03:08.643 --> 00:03:11.570
when you multiply by the number of women
who were diagnosed

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:13.459
with this osteopenia.

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:15.515
And so is it any wonder,

00:03:15.515 --> 00:03:18.045
given all of the costs and the side effects

00:03:18.045 --> 00:03:22.249
of the drugs that we're using to treat these preconditions, that every year

00:03:22.249 --> 00:03:25.922
we're spending more than two trillion dollars on healthcare and yet

00:03:25.922 --> 00:03:29.209
100,000 people a year -- and that's a conservative estimate -- are dying

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:31.122
not because of the conditions they have,

00:03:31.122 --> 00:03:35.409
but because of the treatments that we're giving them and the complications of those treatments?

00:03:35.409 --> 00:03:38.221
We've medicalized everything

00:03:38.221 --> 00:03:39.190
in this country.

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:42.573
Women in the audience, I have
some

00:03:42.573 --> 00:03:44.572
pretty bad news that you already know,

00:03:44.572 --> 00:03:47.229
and that's that every aspect of your
life

00:03:47.229 --> 00:03:48.637
has been medicalized.

00:03:48.637 --> 00:03:51.061
Strike one is when you hit puberty.

00:03:51.061 --> 00:03:55.397
You now have something that happens to you once a month that has been medicalized.

00:03:55.397 --> 00:03:56.213
It's a condition;

00:03:56.213 --> 00:03:57.773
it has to be treated. Strike two

00:03:57.773 --> 00:03:59.373
is if you get pregnant.

00:03:59.373 --> 00:04:02.469
That's been medicalized as
well.

00:04:02.469 --> 00:04:04.389
You have to have a high-tech experience

00:04:04.389 --> 00:04:07.117
of pregnancy, otherwise something might go wrong.

00:04:07.117 --> 00:04:10.724
Strike three is menopause.

00:04:10.724 --> 00:04:15.061
We all know what happened when millions of women were given hormone replacement therapy

00:04:15.061 --> 00:04:18.107
for menopausal symptoms

00:04:18.107 --> 00:04:22.537
for decades until all of a sudden we realized, because a study came out, a big one,

00:04:22.537 --> 00:04:23.545
NIH-funded.

00:04:23.545 --> 00:04:24.473
It said,

00:04:24.473 --> 00:04:29.058
actually, a lot of that hormone replacement therapy may be doing more harm than good

00:04:29.058 --> 00:04:30.842
for many of those women.

00:04:30.842 --> 00:04:33.090
Just in case,

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:34.722
I don't want to leave the men out --

00:04:34.722 --> 00:04:36.338
I am one, after all --

00:04:36.338 --> 00:04:39.027
I have really bad news for all of you in
this room,

00:04:39.027 --> 00:04:39.987
and for everyone

00:04:39.987 --> 00:04:41.733
listening and watching elsewhere:

00:04:41.733 --> 00:04:42.946
You all have

00:04:42.946 --> 00:04:45.882
a universally fatal condition.

00:04:45.882 --> 00:04:49.190
So, just take a moment.

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:50.522
It's called pre-death.

00:04:50.522 --> 00:04:55.594
Every single one of you has it, because
you have the risk factor for it,

00:04:55.594 --> 00:04:57.338
which is being alive.

00:04:57.338 --> 00:05:00.396
But I have some good news for you,
because

00:05:00.396 --> 00:05:04.426
I'm a journalist, I like to end things in a happy way or a forward-thinking way.

00:05:04.426 --> 00:05:08.355
And that good news is that if you can survive to the end of my talk, which

00:05:08.355 --> 00:05:10.947
we'll see if that happens for everyone,

00:05:10.947 --> 00:05:14.242
you will be a pre-vivor.

00:05:14.242 --> 00:05:19.058
I made up pre-death.

00:05:19.058 --> 00:05:23.170
If I used someone else's pre-death, I apologize,

00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:24.755
I think I made it up.

00:05:24.755 --> 00:05:26.322
I didn't make up pre-vivor.

00:05:26.322 --> 00:05:31.794
Pre-vivor is what a particular cancer advocacy group would like everyone who

00:05:31.794 --> 00:05:33.066
just has a risk factor,

00:05:33.066 --> 00:05:35.588
but hasn't actually had that cancer,

00:05:35.588 --> 00:05:36.962
to call themselves.

00:05:36.962 --> 00:05:38.537
You are a pre-vivor.

00:05:38.537 --> 00:05:43.010
We've had HBO here this morning. I'm wondering if Mark Burnett is anywhere in the

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:44.515
audience, I'd like to suggest

00:05:44.515 --> 00:05:48.722
a reality TV show called "Pre-vivor."

00:05:48.722 --> 00:05:52.223
If you develop a disease, you're off
the island.

00:05:52.223 --> 00:05:57.358
But the problem is, we have a system

00:05:57.358 --> 00:05:59.230
that is completely --

00:05:59.230 --> 00:06:01.157
basically promoted this.

00:06:01.157 --> 00:06:04.023
We've selected, at every point in this system,

00:06:04.023 --> 00:06:08.010
to do what we do, and to give everyone a
precondition and then eventually

00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:09.989
a condition, in some cases.

00:06:09.989 --> 00:06:14.482
Start with the doctor-patient
relationship. Doctors, most of them,

00:06:14.482 --> 00:06:19.508
are in a fee-for-service system. They are
basically incentivized to do more --

00:06:19.508 --> 00:06:21.165
procedures, tests,

00:06:21.165 --> 00:06:22.831
prescribe medications.

00:06:22.831 --> 00:06:24.196
Patients come to them,

00:06:24.196 --> 00:06:28.196
they want to do something. We're
Americans, we can't just stand

00:06:28.196 --> 00:06:31.077
there, we have to do something. And so
they want a drug.

00:06:31.077 --> 00:06:34.852
They want a treatment. They want to be told, this is what you have and this is how

00:06:34.852 --> 00:06:37.172
you treat it. If the doctor
doesn't give you that,

00:06:37.172 --> 00:06:38.996
you go somewhere else.

00:06:38.996 --> 00:06:40.876
That's not very good for doctors'
business.

00:06:40.876 --> 00:06:42.564
Or even worse,

00:06:42.564 --> 00:06:46.523
if you are diagnosed with something
eventually, and the doctor didn't order that test,

00:06:46.523 --> 00:06:48.747
you get sued.

00:06:48.747 --> 00:06:51.779
We have pharmaceutical companies that are
constantly trying to expand

00:06:51.779 --> 00:06:57.123
the indications, expand the number of people who are eligible for a given treatment,

00:06:57.123 --> 00:06:59.916
because that obviously helps their bottom line.
We have advocacy groups,

00:06:59.916 --> 00:07:02.171
like the one that's come up with
pre-vivor,

00:07:02.171 --> 00:07:06.411
who want to make more and more people feel they are at risk, or might have a condition,

00:07:06.411 --> 00:07:08.540
so that they can raise more funds

00:07:08.540 --> 00:07:11.155
and raise visibility, et cetera.

00:07:11.155 --> 00:07:12.995
But this isn't actually,

00:07:12.995 --> 00:07:16.091
despite what journalists typically do,
this isn't actually about blaming

00:07:16.091 --> 00:07:17.379
particular players.

00:07:17.379 --> 00:07:19.180
We are all responsible.

00:07:19.180 --> 00:07:20.622
I'm responsible.

00:07:20.622 --> 00:07:23.660
I actually root for the Yankees, I mean talk
about

00:07:23.660 --> 00:07:26.852
rooting for the worst
possible

00:07:26.852 --> 00:07:29.462
offender when it comes to doing
everything you can do.

00:07:29.462 --> 00:07:30.999
Thank you.

00:07:30.999 --> 00:07:34.963
But everyone is responsible.

00:07:34.963 --> 00:07:37.868
I went to medical school,

00:07:37.868 --> 00:07:42.620
and I didn't have a course called How to Think Skeptically,

00:07:42.620 --> 00:07:44.283
or How Not to Order Tests.

00:07:44.283 --> 00:07:46.934
We have this system

00:07:46.934 --> 00:07:49.451
where that's what you do.

00:07:49.451 --> 00:07:52.076
And it actually took being a journalist

00:07:52.076 --> 00:07:55.979
to understand all these incentives. You know, economists like to say,

00:07:55.979 --> 00:07:57.198
there are no bad people,

00:07:57.198 --> 00:07:59.075
there are just bad incentives.

00:07:59.075 --> 00:08:00.683
And that's actually true.

00:08:00.683 --> 00:08:04.140
Because what we've created is a sort of Field of Dreams, when it comes to medical technology.

00:08:04.150 --> 00:08:09.450
So when you put another MRI in
every corner, you put a robot

00:08:09.450 --> 00:08:12.988
in every hospital saying that everyone has to have robotic surgery.

00:08:12.988 --> 00:08:16.804
Well, we've created a system where if you
build it, they will come.

00:08:16.804 --> 00:08:20.331
But you can actually perversely

00:08:20.331 --> 00:08:23.115
tell people to come, convince them

00:08:23.115 --> 00:08:24.804
that they have to come.

00:08:24.804 --> 00:08:29.429
It was when I became a journalist that I really realized how I was part of this problem,

00:08:29.612 --> 00:08:31.636
and how we all are part of this problem.

00:08:31.636 --> 00:08:35.292
I was medicalizing every risk factor, I was writing stories, commissioning stories,

00:08:35.292 --> 00:08:38.685
every day, that were trying to,

00:08:38.685 --> 00:08:41.682
not necessarily make people worried, although that was what often happened.

00:08:41.682 --> 00:08:44.705
But, you know, there are ways out.

00:08:44.705 --> 00:08:46.577
I saw my own internist last week,

00:08:46.577 --> 00:08:49.109
and he said to me,

00:08:49.109 --> 00:08:51.626
"You know," and he told me something that

00:08:51.626 --> 00:08:54.100
everyone in this audience could have
told me for free,

00:08:54.100 --> 00:08:56.588
but I paid him for the privilege, which
is that

00:08:56.588 --> 00:08:58.257
I need to lose some weight.

00:08:58.257 --> 00:09:02.714
Well, he's right. I've had honest-to-goodness high blood pressure

00:09:02.714 --> 00:09:04.427
for a dozen years now, same

00:09:04.427 --> 00:09:06.201
age my father got it,

00:09:06.201 --> 00:09:09.988
and it's a real disease. It's not pre-hypertension, it's actual

00:09:09.988 --> 00:09:11.961
hypertension, high blood pressure.

00:09:11.961 --> 00:09:12.946
Well, he's right,

00:09:12.946 --> 00:09:16.026
but he didn't say to me,

00:09:16.026 --> 00:09:17.713
well, you have pre-obesity or

00:09:17.713 --> 00:09:21.058
you have pre-diabetes, or anything like that. He didn't say,

00:09:21.058 --> 00:09:24.434
better start taking this Statin, you need to lower your cholesterol.

00:09:24.434 --> 00:09:27.593
No, he said, "Go out and lose some weight. Come back and see me in a bit,

00:09:27.593 --> 00:09:29.594
or just give me a call and let me know how you're doing."

00:09:29.594 --> 00:09:31.634
So that's, to me,

00:09:31.634 --> 00:09:33.265
a way forward.

00:09:33.265 --> 00:09:35.629
Billy Beane, by the way, learned the same
thing.

00:09:35.629 --> 00:09:37.165
He learned,

00:09:37.165 --> 00:09:40.682
from watching this kid who he eventually hired, who was really successful for him,

00:09:40.682 --> 00:09:45.557
that it wasn't swinging for the fences, it
wasn't swinging at every pitch

00:09:45.557 --> 00:09:50.317
like the sluggers do, which is what all the expensive teams like the Yankees like to --

00:09:50.326 --> 00:09:51.666
they like to pick up those guys.

00:09:51.666 --> 00:09:56.255
This kid told him, you know, you gotta watch the guys, and you gotta go out and find

00:09:56.255 --> 00:09:57.494
the guys who like to walk,

00:09:57.494 --> 00:09:59.198
because getting on base by a walk

00:09:59.198 --> 00:10:01.966
is just as good, and in our healthcare
system

00:10:01.966 --> 00:10:03.406
we need to figure out,

00:10:03.406 --> 00:10:04.982
is that really a good pitch

00:10:04.982 --> 00:10:07.900
or should we let it go by and not swing at everything?

00:10:07.900 --> 00:10:09.675
Thanks.
