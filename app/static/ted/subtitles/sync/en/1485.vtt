WEBVTT

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:16.444
What I'm going to do is to just give a few notes,

00:00:16.444 --> 00:00:20.260
and this is from a book I'm preparing called

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:22.685
"Letters to a Young Scientist."

00:00:22.685 --> 00:00:24.836
I'd thought it'd be appropriate to

00:00:24.836 --> 00:00:29.925
present it, on the basis that I have had extensive experience

00:00:29.925 --> 00:00:33.621
in teaching, counseling scientists across a broad array of fields.

00:00:33.621 --> 00:00:39.020
And you might like to hear some of the principles that I've developed in doing

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:40.701
that teaching and counseling.

00:00:40.701 --> 00:00:43.599
So let me begin by urging you,

00:00:43.599 --> 00:00:46.148
particularly you on the youngsters' side,

00:00:46.148 --> 00:00:48.124
on this path you've chosen,

00:00:48.124 --> 00:00:50.028
to go as far as you can.

00:00:50.028 --> 00:00:53.496
The world needs you, badly.

00:00:53.496 --> 00:00:58.014
Humanity is now fully into the techno-scientific age.

00:00:58.014 --> 00:01:00.493
There is going to be no turning back.

00:01:00.493 --> 00:01:05.418
Although varying among disciplines -- say, astrophysics,

00:01:05.418 --> 00:01:09.380
molecular genetics, the immunology, the microbiology, the public

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:15.574
health, to the new area of the human body as a symbiont,

00:01:15.574 --> 00:01:18.055
to public health, environmental science.

00:01:18.055 --> 00:01:21.171
Knowledge in medical science and science overall

00:01:21.171 --> 00:01:24.308
is doubling every 15 to 20 years.

00:01:24.308 --> 00:01:27.396
Technology is increasing at a comparable rate.

00:01:27.396 --> 00:01:30.380
Between them, the two already pervade,

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:33.244
as most of you here seated realize,

00:01:33.244 --> 00:01:35.629
every dimension of human life.

00:01:35.629 --> 00:01:40.685
So swift is the velocity of the techno-scientific revolution,

00:01:40.685 --> 00:01:45.412
so startling in its countless twists and turns, that no one can predict

00:01:45.412 --> 00:01:49.860
its outcome even a decade from the present moment.

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:51.557
There will come a time, of course,

00:01:51.557 --> 00:01:55.308
when the exponential growth of discovery and knowledge,

00:01:55.308 --> 00:01:57.444
which actually began in the 1600s,

00:01:57.444 --> 00:02:00.260
has to peak and level off,

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:01.508
but that's not going to matter to you.

00:02:01.508 --> 00:02:02.822
The revolution is going to continue

00:02:02.822 --> 00:02:05.780
for at least several more decades.

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:07.524
It'll render the human condition

00:02:07.524 --> 00:02:09.870
radically different from what it is today.

00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:16.188
Traditional fields of study are going to continue to grow

00:02:16.188 --> 00:02:21.013
and in so doing, inevitably they will meet and create new disciplines.

00:02:21.013 --> 00:02:24.860
In time, all of science will come to be

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:30.316
a continuum of description, an explanation of networks, of principles and laws.

00:02:30.316 --> 00:02:33.516
That's why you need not just be training

00:02:33.516 --> 00:02:37.956
in one specialty, but also acquire breadth in other fields,

00:02:37.956 --> 00:02:41.644
related to and even distant from your own initial choice.

00:02:41.644 --> 00:02:45.589
Keep your eyes lifted and your head turning.

00:02:45.589 --> 00:02:48.654
The search for knowledge is in our genes.

00:02:48.654 --> 00:02:52.166
It was put there by our distant ancestors

00:02:52.166 --> 00:02:53.789
who spread across the world,

00:02:53.789 --> 00:02:55.484
and it's never going to be quenched.

00:02:55.484 --> 00:02:58.677
To understand and use it sanely,

00:02:58.677 --> 00:03:02.636
as a part of the civilization yet to evolve

00:03:02.636 --> 00:03:08.478
requires a vastly larger population of scientifically trained people like you.

00:03:08.478 --> 00:03:12.516
In education, medicine, law, diplomacy,

00:03:12.516 --> 00:03:16.804
government, business and the media that exist today.

00:03:16.804 --> 00:03:21.764
Our political leaders need at least a modest degree of scientific

00:03:21.764 --> 00:03:24.860
literacy, which most badly lack today --

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:26.404
no applause, please.

00:03:26.404 --> 00:03:28.862
It will be better for all

00:03:28.862 --> 00:03:33.533
if they prepare before entering office rather than learning on the job.

00:03:33.533 --> 00:03:36.692
Therefore you will do well to act on the side,

00:03:36.692 --> 00:03:39.397
no matter how far into the laboratory

00:03:39.397 --> 00:03:42.716
you may go, to serve as teachers

00:03:42.716 --> 00:03:44.724
during the span of your career.

00:03:44.724 --> 00:03:46.799
I'll now proceed quickly,

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:49.988
and before else, to a subject that is both a vital asset

00:03:49.988 --> 00:03:53.420
and a potential barrier to a scientific career.

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:56.900
If you are a bit short in mathematical skills,

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:58.229
don't worry.

00:03:58.229 --> 00:04:00.740
Many of the most successful scientists

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:04.940
at work today are mathematically semi-literate.

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:07.425
A metaphor will serve here:

00:04:07.425 --> 00:04:13.428
Where elite mathematicians and statisticians

00:04:13.428 --> 00:04:18.493
and theorists often serve as architects in the expanding realm

00:04:18.493 --> 00:04:22.196
of science, the remaining large majority of

00:04:22.196 --> 00:04:26.908
basic applied scientists, including a large portion of those who could be

00:04:26.908 --> 00:04:32.260
said to be of the first rank, are the ones who map the terrain, they scout

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:35.012
the frontiers, they cut the pathways,

00:04:35.012 --> 00:04:37.748
they raise the buildings along the way.

00:04:37.748 --> 00:04:40.924
Some may have considered me foolhardy,

00:04:40.924 --> 00:04:44.685
but it's been my habit to brush aside the fear of mathematics

00:04:44.685 --> 00:04:46.748
when talking to candidate scientists.

00:04:46.748 --> 00:04:50.548
During 41 years of teaching biology at Harvard,

00:04:50.548 --> 00:04:54.665
I watched sadly as bright students turned away

00:04:54.665 --> 00:04:57.589
from the possibility of a scientific career

00:04:57.589 --> 00:05:01.317
or even from taking non-required courses in science

00:05:01.317 --> 00:05:03.148
because they were afraid of failure.

00:05:03.148 --> 00:05:06.508
These math-phobes deprive science and medicine

00:05:06.508 --> 00:05:09.757
of immeasurable amounts of badly needed talent.

00:05:09.757 --> 00:05:13.708
Here's how to relax your anxieties, if you have them:

00:05:13.708 --> 00:05:16.300
Understand that mathematics is a language

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:20.124
ruled like other verbal languages,

00:05:20.124 --> 00:05:23.123
or like verbal language generally, by its own grammar

00:05:23.123 --> 00:05:25.028
and system of logic.

00:05:25.028 --> 00:05:27.886
Any person with average quantitative intelligence

00:05:27.886 --> 00:05:31.028
who learns to read and write mathematics

00:05:31.028 --> 00:05:37.780
at an elementary level will, as in verbal language, have little difficulty

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:39.844
picking up most of the fundamentals

00:05:39.844 --> 00:05:45.181
if they choose to master the mathspeak of most disciplines of science.

00:05:45.181 --> 00:05:48.964
The longer you wait to become at least semi-literate

00:05:48.964 --> 00:05:54.972
the harder the language of mathematics will be to master, just as again in any verbal

00:05:54.972 --> 00:05:57.949
language, but it can be done at any age.

00:05:57.949 --> 00:05:59.660
I speak as an authority

00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:03.511
on that subject, because I'm an extreme case.

00:06:03.511 --> 00:06:07.172
I didn't take algebra until my freshman year

00:06:07.172 --> 00:06:09.203
at the University of Alabama.

00:06:09.203 --> 00:06:11.524
They didn't teach it before then.

00:06:11.524 --> 00:06:16.428
I finally got around to calculus as a 32-year-old tenured professor at Harvard,

00:06:16.428 --> 00:06:21.054
where I sat uncomfortably in classes with undergraduate students,

00:06:21.054 --> 00:06:23.484
little more than half my age.

00:06:23.484 --> 00:06:24.956
A couple of them were students

00:06:24.956 --> 00:06:28.212
in a course I was giving on evolutionary biology.

00:06:28.212 --> 00:06:33.468
I swallowed my pride, and I learned calculus.

00:06:33.468 --> 00:06:36.564
I found out that in science and all its applications,

00:06:36.564 --> 00:06:40.526
what is crucial is not that technical ability,

00:06:40.526 --> 00:06:43.695
but it is imagination in all of its applications.

00:06:43.695 --> 00:06:48.029
The ability to form concepts with images of entities and processes

00:06:48.029 --> 00:06:50.965
pictured by intuition.

00:06:50.965 --> 00:06:55.309
I found out that advances in science rarely come upstream

00:06:55.309 --> 00:06:58.341
from an ability to stand at a blackboard

00:06:58.341 --> 00:07:01.476
and conjure images from unfolding mathematical propositions

00:07:01.476 --> 00:07:03.332
and equations.

00:07:03.332 --> 00:07:08.764
They are instead the products of downstream imagination leading to hard work,

00:07:08.764 --> 00:07:13.324
during which mathematical reasoning may or may not prove to be relevant.

00:07:13.324 --> 00:07:18.523
Ideas emerge when a part of the real or imagined world is studied

00:07:18.523 --> 00:07:19.940
for its own sake.

00:07:19.940 --> 00:07:25.581
Of foremost importance is a thorough, well-organized knowledge

00:07:25.581 --> 00:07:32.230
of all that is known of the relevant entities and processes that might be involved in that domain

00:07:32.230 --> 00:07:33.670
you propose to enter.

00:07:33.670 --> 00:07:35.796
When something new is discovered,

00:07:35.796 --> 00:07:40.765
it's logical then that one of the follow-up steps is

00:07:40.765 --> 00:07:44.917
to find the mathematical and statistical methods to move its analysis forward.

00:07:44.917 --> 00:07:47.469
If that step proves too difficult for

00:07:47.469 --> 00:07:51.641
the person or team that made the discovery,

00:07:51.641 --> 00:07:56.940
a mathematician can then be added by them

00:07:56.940 --> 00:07:59.237
as a collaborator.

00:07:59.237 --> 00:08:01.396
Consider the following principle,

00:08:01.396 --> 00:08:06.596
which I will modestly call Wilson's Principle Number One:

00:08:06.596 --> 00:08:10.996
It is far easier for scientists

00:08:10.996 --> 00:08:15.565
including medical researchers, to require needed collaboration

00:08:15.565 --> 00:08:17.683
in mathematics and statistics

00:08:17.683 --> 00:08:21.364
than it is for mathematicians and statisticians

00:08:21.364 --> 00:08:25.460
to find scientists able to make use of their equations.

00:08:25.460 --> 00:08:29.554
It is important in choosing the direction to take in science

00:08:29.554 --> 00:08:35.300
to find the subject at your level of competence that interests you deeply,

00:08:35.300 --> 00:08:36.940
and focus on that.

00:08:36.940 --> 00:08:41.636
Keep in mind, then, Wilson's Second Principle:

00:08:41.636 --> 00:08:46.172
For every scientist, whether researcher, technician,

00:08:46.172 --> 00:08:49.267
teacher, manager or businessman,

00:08:49.267 --> 00:08:53.254
working at any level of mathematical competence,

00:08:53.254 --> 00:08:56.708
there exists a discipline in science or medicine

00:08:56.708 --> 00:09:00.644
for which that level is enough to achieve excellence.

00:09:00.644 --> 00:09:03.204
Now I'm going to offer quickly

00:09:03.204 --> 00:09:05.612
several more principles that will be useful

00:09:05.612 --> 00:09:08.300
in organizing your education and career,

00:09:08.300 --> 00:09:12.685
or if you're teaching, how you might

00:09:12.685 --> 00:09:17.573
enhance your own teaching and counseling of young scientists.

00:09:17.573 --> 00:09:21.372
In selecting a subject in which to conduct original research,

00:09:21.372 --> 00:09:24.572
or to develop world-class expertise,

00:09:24.572 --> 00:09:29.900
take a part of the chosen discipline that is sparsely inhabited.

00:09:29.900 --> 00:09:34.612
Judge opportunity by how few other students and researchers

00:09:34.612 --> 00:09:36.148
are on hand.

00:09:36.148 --> 00:09:39.798
This is not to de-emphasize the essential requirement

00:09:39.798 --> 00:09:43.237
of broad training, or the value of apprenticing yourself

00:09:43.237 --> 00:09:47.700
in ongoing research to programs of high quality.

00:09:47.700 --> 00:09:52.428
It is important also to acquire older mentors within these successful

00:09:52.428 --> 00:09:56.316
programs, and to make friends and colleagues of your age

00:09:56.316 --> 00:09:58.172
for mutual support.

00:09:58.172 --> 00:10:00.860
But through it all, look for a way to break out,

00:10:00.860 --> 00:10:04.796
to find a field and subject not yet popular.

00:10:04.796 --> 00:10:08.573
We have seen this demonstrated already in the talks preceding mine.

00:10:08.573 --> 00:10:13.684
There is the quickest way advances are likely to occur,

00:10:13.684 --> 00:10:17.301
as measured in discoveries per investigator per year.

00:10:17.301 --> 00:10:18.908
You may have heard the

00:10:18.908 --> 00:10:22.668
military dictum for the gathering of armies:

00:10:22.668 --> 00:10:25.389
March to the sound of the guns.

00:10:25.389 --> 00:10:31.899
In science, the exact opposite is the case: March away from the sound of the guns.

00:10:31.899 --> 00:10:34.604
So Wilson's Principle Number Three:

00:10:34.604 --> 00:10:37.948
March away from the sound of the guns.

00:10:37.948 --> 00:10:39.812
Observe from a distance,

00:10:39.812 --> 00:10:41.909
but do not join the fray.

00:10:41.909 --> 00:10:44.277
Make a fray of your own.

00:10:44.277 --> 00:10:48.532
Once you have settled on a specialty,

00:10:48.532 --> 00:10:53.812
and the profession you can love, and you've secured opportunity,

00:10:53.812 --> 00:10:59.093
your potential to succeed will be greatly enhanced if you study it

00:10:59.093 --> 00:11:01.773
enough to become an expert.

00:11:01.773 --> 00:11:05.100
There are thousands of professionally delimited

00:11:05.100 --> 00:11:07.576
subjects sprinkled through physics and chemistry

00:11:07.576 --> 00:11:09.492
to biology and medicine.

00:11:09.492 --> 00:11:12.388
And on then into the social sciences,

00:11:12.388 --> 00:11:15.590
where it is possible in short time to acquire

00:11:15.590 --> 00:11:18.164
the status of an authority.

00:11:18.164 --> 00:11:21.676
When the subject is still very thinly populated,

00:11:21.676 --> 00:11:24.297
you can with diligence and hard work become

00:11:24.297 --> 00:11:26.508
the world authority.

00:11:26.508 --> 00:11:30.469
The world needs this kind of expertise,

00:11:30.469 --> 00:11:32.644
and it rewards the kind of people

00:11:32.644 --> 00:11:34.796
willing to acquire it.

00:11:34.796 --> 00:11:39.292
The existing information and what you self-discover

00:11:39.292 --> 00:11:43.403
may at first seem skimpy and difficult to connect

00:11:43.403 --> 00:11:45.439
to other bodies of knowledge.

00:11:45.439 --> 00:11:47.308
Well, if that's the case,

00:11:47.308 --> 00:11:51.450
good. Why hard instead of easy?

00:11:51.450 --> 00:11:56.305
The answer deserves to be stated as Principle Number Four.

00:11:56.305 --> 00:11:59.724
In the attempt to make scientific discoveries,

00:11:59.724 --> 00:12:01.717
every problem is an opportunity,

00:12:01.717 --> 00:12:03.212
and the more difficult the problem,

00:12:03.212 --> 00:12:05.972
the greater will be the importance of its solution.

00:12:05.972 --> 00:12:09.780
Now this brings me to a basic categorization

00:12:09.780 --> 00:12:12.655
in the way scientific discoveries are made.

00:12:12.655 --> 00:12:16.019
Scientists, pure mathematicians among them,

00:12:16.019 --> 00:12:19.286
follow one or the other of two pathways:

00:12:19.286 --> 00:12:21.396
First through early discoveries,

00:12:21.396 --> 00:12:23.540
a problem is identified

00:12:23.540 --> 00:12:25.372
and a solution is sought.

00:12:25.372 --> 00:12:27.901
The problem may be relatively small;

00:12:27.901 --> 00:12:33.322
for example, where exactly in a cruise ship does the norovirus begin to spread?

00:12:33.322 --> 00:12:39.228
Or larger, what's the role of dark matter in the expansion of the universe?

00:12:39.228 --> 00:12:43.687
As the answer is sought, other phenomena are typically discovered

00:12:43.687 --> 00:12:45.332
and other questions are asked.

00:12:45.332 --> 00:12:48.348
This first of the two strategies is like a hunter,

00:12:48.348 --> 00:12:52.597
exploring a forest in search of a particular quarry,

00:12:52.597 --> 00:12:55.516
who finds other quarries along the way.

00:12:55.516 --> 00:12:58.348
The second strategy of research

00:12:58.348 --> 00:13:00.140
is to study a subject broadly

00:13:00.140 --> 00:13:04.916
searching for unknown phenomena or patterns of known phenomena

00:13:04.916 --> 00:13:08.717
like a hunter in what we call "the naturalist's trance,"

00:13:08.717 --> 00:13:12.380
the researcher of mind is open to anything interesting,

00:13:12.380 --> 00:13:13.764
any quarry worth taking.

00:13:13.764 --> 00:13:16.117
The search is not for the solution of the problem,

00:13:16.117 --> 00:13:19.324
but for problems themselves worth solving.

00:13:19.324 --> 00:13:21.316
The two strategies of research,

00:13:21.316 --> 00:13:24.501
original research, can be stated as follows,

00:13:24.501 --> 00:13:28.789
in the final principle I'm going to offer you:

00:13:28.789 --> 00:13:33.053
For every problem in a given discipline of science,

00:13:33.053 --> 00:13:36.628
there exists a species or entity or phenomenon

00:13:36.628 --> 00:13:38.574
ideal for its solution.

00:13:38.574 --> 00:13:43.972
And conversely, for every species or other entity

00:13:43.972 --> 00:13:46.908
or phenomenon, there exist important problems

00:13:46.908 --> 00:13:54.485
for the solution of which, those particular objects of research are ideally suited.

00:13:54.485 --> 00:13:56.422
Find out what they are.

00:13:56.422 --> 00:13:59.557
You'll find your own way to discover,

00:13:59.557 --> 00:14:01.740
to learn, to teach.

00:14:01.740 --> 00:14:05.173
The decades ahead will see dramatic advances

00:14:05.173 --> 00:14:09.740
in disease prevention, general health, the quality of life.

00:14:09.740 --> 00:14:15.765
All of humanity depends on the knowledge and practice of the medicine and the science

00:14:15.765 --> 00:14:17.348
behind it you will master.

00:14:17.348 --> 00:14:20.812
You have chosen a calling that will come in steps

00:14:20.812 --> 00:14:26.223
to give you satisfaction, at its conclusion, of a life well lived.

00:14:26.223 --> 00:14:28.836
And I thank you for having me here tonight.

00:14:28.836 --> 00:14:34.204
(Applause)

00:14:34.204 --> 00:14:35.476
Oh, thank you.

00:14:35.476 --> 00:14:42.632
Thank you very much.

00:14:42.632 --> 00:14:47.164
I salute you.
