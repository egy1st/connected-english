WEBVTT

00:00:13.285 --> 00:00:15.261
Everyone is both a learner

00:00:15.261 --> 00:00:16.773
and a teacher.

00:00:16.773 --> 00:00:19.229
This is me being inspired

00:00:19.229 --> 00:00:20.420
by my first tutor,

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:21.365
my mom,

00:00:21.365 --> 00:00:23.988
and this is me teaching

00:00:23.988 --> 00:00:25.941
Introduction to Artificial Intelligence

00:00:25.941 --> 00:00:27.181
to 200 students

00:00:27.181 --> 00:00:28.453
at Stanford University.

00:00:28.453 --> 00:00:29.909
Now the students and I

00:00:29.909 --> 00:00:31.085
enjoyed the class,

00:00:31.085 --> 00:00:32.501
but it occurred to me

00:00:32.501 --> 00:00:34.212
that while the subject matter

00:00:34.212 --> 00:00:35.501
of the class is advanced

00:00:35.501 --> 00:00:36.189
and modern,

00:00:36.189 --> 00:00:38.508
the teaching technology isn't.

00:00:38.508 --> 00:00:40.844
In fact, I use basically

00:00:40.844 --> 00:00:43.214
the same technology as

00:00:43.214 --> 00:00:45.844
this 14th-century classroom.

00:00:45.844 --> 00:00:48.644
Note the textbook,

00:00:48.644 --> 00:00:51.588
the sage on the stage,

00:00:51.588 --> 00:00:53.487
and the sleeping guy

00:00:53.487 --> 00:00:54.388
in the back. (Laughter)

00:00:54.388 --> 00:00:57.325
Just like today.

00:00:57.325 --> 00:01:00.436
So my co-teacher,

00:01:00.436 --> 00:01:02.076
Sebastian Thrun, and I thought,

00:01:02.076 --> 00:01:03.850
there must be a better way.

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:05.504
We challenged ourselves

00:01:05.504 --> 00:01:06.795
to create an online class

00:01:06.795 --> 00:01:08.426
that would be equal or better

00:01:08.426 --> 00:01:10.762
in quality to our Stanford class,

00:01:10.762 --> 00:01:12.972
but to bring it to anyone

00:01:12.972 --> 00:01:14.602
in the world for free.

00:01:14.602 --> 00:01:17.170
We announced the class on July 29th,

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:20.379
and within two weeks, 50,000 people

00:01:20.379 --> 00:01:21.786
had signed up for it.

00:01:21.786 --> 00:01:24.891
And that grew to 160,000 students

00:01:24.891 --> 00:01:26.955
from 209 countries.

00:01:26.955 --> 00:01:28.763
We were thrilled to have

00:01:28.763 --> 00:01:29.884
that kind of audience,

00:01:29.884 --> 00:01:32.523
and just a bit terrified that we

00:01:32.523 --> 00:01:34.834
hadn't finished preparing the class yet. (Laughter)

00:01:34.834 --> 00:01:36.446
So we got to work.

00:01:36.446 --> 00:01:38.082
We studied what others had done,

00:01:38.082 --> 00:01:40.405
what we could copy and what we could change.

00:01:40.405 --> 00:01:43.066
Benjamin Bloom had showed

00:01:43.066 --> 00:01:44.875
that one-on-one tutoring works best,

00:01:44.875 --> 00:01:47.003
so that's what we tried to emulate,

00:01:47.003 --> 00:01:48.443
like with me and my mom,

00:01:48.443 --> 00:01:49.948
even though we knew

00:01:49.948 --> 00:01:51.866
it would be one-on-thousands.

00:01:51.866 --> 00:01:54.067
Here, an overhead video camera

00:01:54.067 --> 00:01:55.899
is recording me as I'm talking

00:01:55.899 --> 00:01:57.578
and drawing on a piece of paper.

00:01:57.578 --> 00:01:59.987
A student said, "This class felt

00:01:59.987 --> 00:02:01.139
like sitting in a bar

00:02:01.139 --> 00:02:02.618
with a really smart friend

00:02:02.618 --> 00:02:03.822
who's explaining something

00:02:03.822 --> 00:02:06.123
you haven't grasped, but are about to."

00:02:06.123 --> 00:02:08.239
And that's exactly what we were aiming for.

00:02:08.239 --> 00:02:11.027
Now, from Khan Academy, we saw

00:02:11.027 --> 00:02:12.851
that short 10-minute videos

00:02:12.851 --> 00:02:14.627
worked much better than trying

00:02:14.627 --> 00:02:16.698
to record an hour-long lecture

00:02:16.698 --> 00:02:19.115
and put it on the small-format screen.

00:02:19.115 --> 00:02:21.307
We decided to go even shorter

00:02:21.307 --> 00:02:22.955
and more interactive.

00:02:22.955 --> 00:02:25.202
Our typical video is two minutes,

00:02:25.202 --> 00:02:26.954
sometimes shorter, never more

00:02:26.954 --> 00:02:29.643
than six, and then we pause for

00:02:29.643 --> 00:02:31.010
a quiz question, to make it

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:32.888
feel like one-on-one tutoring.

00:02:32.888 --> 00:02:35.290
Here, I'm explaining how a computer uses

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:36.538
the grammar of English

00:02:36.538 --> 00:02:38.715
to parse sentences, and here,

00:02:38.715 --> 00:02:40.779
there's a pause and the student

00:02:40.779 --> 00:02:43.016
has to reflect, understand what's going on

00:02:43.016 --> 00:02:44.656
and check the right boxes

00:02:44.656 --> 00:02:46.073
before they can continue.

00:02:46.073 --> 00:02:48.521
Students learn best when

00:02:48.521 --> 00:02:49.769
they're actively practicing.

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:52.065
We wanted to engage them, to have them grapple

00:02:52.065 --> 00:02:55.033
with ambiguity and guide them to synthesize

00:02:55.033 --> 00:02:56.698
the key ideas themselves.

00:02:56.698 --> 00:02:58.410
We mostly avoid questions

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:00.121
like, "Here's a formula, now

00:03:00.121 --> 00:03:01.196
tell me the value of Y

00:03:01.196 --> 00:03:02.408
when X is equal to two."

00:03:02.408 --> 00:03:04.225
We preferred open-ended questions.

00:03:04.225 --> 00:03:07.403
One student wrote, "Now I'm seeing

00:03:07.403 --> 00:03:09.265
Bayes networks and examples of

00:03:09.265 --> 00:03:10.833
game theory everywhere I look."

00:03:10.833 --> 00:03:12.571
And I like that kind of response.

00:03:12.571 --> 00:03:14.377
That's just what we were going for.

00:03:14.377 --> 00:03:16.571
We didn't want students to memorize the formulas;

00:03:16.571 --> 00:03:17.761
we wanted to change the way

00:03:17.761 --> 00:03:18.851
they looked at the world.

00:03:18.851 --> 00:03:20.177
And we succeeded.

00:03:20.177 --> 00:03:22.577
Or, I should say, the students succeeded.

00:03:22.577 --> 00:03:24.496
And it's a little bit ironic

00:03:24.496 --> 00:03:27.409
that we set about to disrupt traditional education,

00:03:27.409 --> 00:03:29.425
and in doing so, we ended up

00:03:29.425 --> 00:03:31.009
making our online class

00:03:31.009 --> 00:03:33.336
much more like a traditional college class

00:03:33.336 --> 00:03:35.177
than other online classes.

00:03:35.177 --> 00:03:38.392
Most online classes, the videos are always available.

00:03:38.392 --> 00:03:40.209
You can watch them any time you want.

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:42.496
But if you can do it any time,

00:03:42.496 --> 00:03:44.001
that means you can do it tomorrow,

00:03:44.001 --> 00:03:45.409
and if you can do it tomorrow,

00:03:45.409 --> 00:03:47.571
well, you may not ever

00:03:47.571 --> 00:03:49.329
get around to it. (Laughter)

00:03:49.329 --> 00:03:51.521
So we brought back the innovation

00:03:51.521 --> 00:03:53.608
of having due dates. (Laughter)

00:03:53.608 --> 00:03:54.920
You could watch the videos

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:56.832
any time you wanted during the week,

00:03:56.832 --> 00:03:57.987
but at the end of the week,

00:03:57.987 --> 00:03:59.704
you had to get the homework done.

00:03:59.704 --> 00:04:01.617
This motivated the students to keep going, and it also

00:04:01.617 --> 00:04:04.473
meant that everybody was working

00:04:04.473 --> 00:04:05.991
on the same thing at the same time,

00:04:05.991 --> 00:04:07.488
so if you went into a discussion forum,

00:04:07.488 --> 00:04:10.192
you could get an answer from a peer within minutes.

00:04:10.192 --> 00:04:13.131
Now, I'll show you some of the forums, most of which

00:04:13.131 --> 00:04:15.897
were self-organized by the students themselves.

00:04:15.897 --> 00:04:19.121
From Daphne Koller and Andrew Ng, we learned

00:04:19.121 --> 00:04:21.117
the concept of "flipping" the classroom.

00:04:21.117 --> 00:04:22.412
Students watched the videos

00:04:22.412 --> 00:04:24.000
on their own, and then they

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.710
come together to discuss them.

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:28.867
From Eric Mazur, I learned about peer instruction,

00:04:28.867 --> 00:04:31.491
that peers can be the best teachers,

00:04:31.491 --> 00:04:32.923
because they're the ones

00:04:32.923 --> 00:04:35.771
that remember what it's like to not understand.

00:04:35.771 --> 00:04:38.452
Sebastian and I have forgotten some of that.

00:04:38.452 --> 00:04:40.851
Of course, we couldn't have

00:04:40.851 --> 00:04:42.483
a classroom discussion with

00:04:42.483 --> 00:04:44.029
tens of thousands of students,

00:04:44.029 --> 00:04:47.515
so we encouraged and nurtured these online forums.

00:04:47.515 --> 00:04:50.563
And finally, from Teach For America,

00:04:50.563 --> 00:04:52.044
I learned that a class is not

00:04:52.044 --> 00:04:53.540
primarily about information.

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:56.371
More important is motivation and determination.

00:04:56.371 --> 00:04:58.211
It was crucial that the students see

00:04:58.211 --> 00:05:00.011
that we're working hard for them and

00:05:00.011 --> 00:05:01.420
they're all supporting each other.

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:04.388
Now, the class ran 10 weeks,

00:05:04.388 --> 00:05:08.299
and in the end, about half of the 160,000 students watched

00:05:08.299 --> 00:05:09.862
at least one video each week,

00:05:09.862 --> 00:05:12.555
and over 20,000 finished all the homework,

00:05:12.555 --> 00:05:14.219
putting in 50 to 100 hours.

00:05:14.219 --> 00:05:15.772
They got this statement of accomplishment.

00:05:15.772 --> 00:05:17.891
So what have we learned?

00:05:17.891 --> 00:05:20.707
Well, we tried some old ideas

00:05:20.707 --> 00:05:22.364
and some new and put them together,

00:05:22.364 --> 00:05:24.446
but there are more ideas to try.

00:05:24.446 --> 00:05:26.260
Sebastian's teaching another class now.

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:27.628
I'll do one in the fall.

00:05:27.628 --> 00:05:31.388
Stanford Coursera, Udacity, MITx

00:05:31.388 --> 00:05:33.659
and others have more classes coming.

00:05:33.659 --> 00:05:35.147
It's a really exciting time.

00:05:35.147 --> 00:05:36.619
But to me, the most exciting

00:05:36.619 --> 00:05:39.595
part of it is the data that we're gathering.

00:05:39.595 --> 00:05:42.291
We're gathering thousands

00:05:42.291 --> 00:05:43.947
of interactions per student per class,

00:05:43.947 --> 00:05:46.155
billions of interactions altogether,

00:05:46.155 --> 00:05:48.659
and now we can start analyzing that,

00:05:48.659 --> 00:05:50.123
and when we learn from that,

00:05:50.123 --> 00:05:51.364
do experimentations,

00:05:51.364 --> 00:05:53.604
that's when the real revolution will come.

00:05:53.604 --> 00:05:56.380
And you'll be able to see the results from

00:05:56.380 --> 00:05:58.643
a new generation of amazing students.

00:05:58.643 --> 00:06:00.896
(Applause)
