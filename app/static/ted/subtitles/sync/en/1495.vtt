00:00:21.902 --> 00:00:26.220
The phenomenon you saw here for a brief moment

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:32.609
is called quantum levitation and quantum locking.

00:00:32.609 --> 00:00:36.498
And the object that was levitating here

00:00:36.498 --> 00:00:38.499
is called a superconductor.

00:00:38.499 --> 00:00:44.091
Superconductivity is a quantum state of matter,

00:00:44.091 --> 00:00:48.348
and it occurs only below a certain critical temperature.

00:00:48.348 --> 00:00:50.694
Now, it's quite an old phenomenon;

00:00:50.694 --> 00:00:52.460
it was discovered 100 years ago.

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:54.586
However, only recently,

00:00:54.586 --> 00:00:56.948
due to several technological advancements,

00:00:56.948 --> 00:00:59.620
we are now able to demonstrate to you

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:03.366
quantum levitation and quantum locking.

00:01:03.366 --> 00:01:09.211
So, a superconductor is defined by two properties.

00:01:09.211 --> 00:01:12.667
The first is zero electrical resistance,

00:01:12.667 --> 00:01:19.556
and the second is the expulsion of a magnetic field from the interior of the superconductor.

00:01:19.556 --> 00:01:22.451
That sounds complicated, right?

00:01:22.451 --> 00:01:25.323
But what is electrical resistance?

00:01:25.323 --> 00:01:31.572
So, electricity is the flow of electrons inside a material.

00:01:31.572 --> 00:01:34.921
And these electrons, while flowing,

00:01:34.921 --> 00:01:37.609
they collide with the atoms, and in these collisions

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:39.825
they lose a certain amount of energy.

00:01:39.825 --> 00:01:45.426
And they dissipate this energy in the form of heat, and you know that effect.

00:01:45.426 --> 00:01:51.345
However, inside a superconductor there are no collisions,

00:01:51.345 --> 00:01:56.037
so there is no energy dissipation.

00:01:56.037 --> 00:01:59.018
It's quite remarkable. Think about it.

00:01:59.018 --> 00:02:04.097
In classical physics, there is always some friction, some energy loss.

00:02:04.097 --> 00:02:08.135
But not here, because it is a quantum effect.

00:02:08.166 --> 00:02:16.852
But that's not all, because superconductors don't like magnetic fields.

00:02:16.852 --> 00:02:21.169
So a superconductor will try to expel magnetic field from the inside,

00:02:21.169 --> 00:02:27.292
and it has the means to do that by circulating currents.

00:02:27.292 --> 00:02:30.282
Now, the combination of both effects --

00:02:30.282 --> 00:02:36.282
the expulsion of magnetic fields and zero electrical resistance --

00:02:36.282 --> 00:02:39.450
is exactly a superconductor.

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:43.666
But the picture isn't always perfect, as we all know,

00:02:43.666 --> 00:02:51.051
and sometimes strands of magnetic field remain inside the superconductor.

00:02:51.051 --> 00:02:54.705
Now, under proper conditions, which we have here,

00:02:54.705 --> 00:02:59.795
these strands of magnetic field can be trapped inside the superconductor.

00:02:59.795 --> 00:03:06.052
And these strands of magnetic field inside the superconductor,

00:03:06.052 --> 00:03:08.897
they come in discrete quantities.

00:03:08.897 --> 00:03:12.543
Why? Because it is a quantum phenomenon. It's quantum physics.

00:03:12.543 --> 00:03:16.393
And it turns out that they behave like quantum particles.

00:03:16.393 --> 00:03:21.972
In this movie here, you can see how they flow one by one discretely.

00:03:21.972 --> 00:03:25.865
This is strands of magnetic field. These are not particles,

00:03:25.865 --> 00:03:30.160
but they behave like particles.

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:34.354
So, this is why we call this effect quantum levitation and quantum locking.

00:03:34.354 --> 00:03:40.417
But what happens to the superconductor when we put it inside a magnetic field?

00:03:40.417 --> 00:03:45.002
Well, first there are strands of magnetic field left inside,

00:03:45.002 --> 00:03:49.122
but now the superconductor doesn't like them moving around,

00:03:49.122 --> 00:03:52.570
because their movements dissipate energy,

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:55.516
which breaks the superconductivity state.

00:03:55.516 --> 00:03:59.874
So what it actually does, it locks these strands,

00:03:59.874 --> 00:04:05.626
which are called fluxons, and it locks these fluxons in place.

00:04:05.626 --> 00:04:11.914
And by doing that, what it actually does is locking itself in place.

00:04:11.914 --> 00:04:21.130
Why? Because any movement of the superconductor will change their place,

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:22.937
will change their configuration.

00:04:22.937 --> 00:04:28.234
So we get quantum locking. And let me show you how this works.

00:04:28.234 --> 00:04:33.994
I have here a superconductor, which I wrapped up so it'd stay cold long enough.

00:04:33.994 --> 00:04:38.458
And when I place it on top of a regular magnet,

00:04:38.458 --> 00:04:42.330
it just stays locked in midair.

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:46.395
(Applause)

00:04:46.395 --> 00:04:50.441
Now, this is not just levitation. It's not just repulsion.

00:04:50.441 --> 00:04:55.562
I can rearrange the fluxons, and it will be locked in this new configuration.

00:04:55.562 --> 00:04:59.586
Like this, or move it slightly to the right or to the left.

00:04:59.586 --> 00:05:07.337
So, this is quantum locking -- actually locking -- three-dimensional locking of the superconductor.

00:05:07.337 --> 00:05:09.497
Of course, I can turn it upside down,

00:05:09.497 --> 00:05:12.403
and it will remain locked.

00:05:12.403 --> 00:05:21.625
Now, now that we understand that this so-called levitation is actually locking,

00:05:21.625 --> 00:05:25.939
Yeah, we understand that.

00:05:25.939 --> 00:05:30.201
You won't be surprised to hear that if I take this circular magnet,

00:05:30.201 --> 00:05:34.169
in which the magnetic field is the same all around,

00:05:34.169 --> 00:05:40.105
the superconductor will be able to freely rotate around the axis of the magnet.

00:05:40.105 --> 00:05:46.129
Why? Because as long as it rotates, the locking is maintained.

00:05:46.129 --> 00:05:52.155
You see? I can adjust and I can rotate the superconductor.

00:05:52.155 --> 00:05:58.817
We have frictionless motion. It is still levitating, but can move freely all around.

00:05:58.817 --> 00:06:08.097
So, we have quantum locking and we can levitate it on top of this magnet.

00:06:08.097 --> 00:06:14.593
But how many fluxons, how many magnetic strands are there in a single disk like this?

00:06:14.593 --> 00:06:17.474
Well, we can calculate it, and it turns out, quite a lot.

00:06:17.474 --> 00:06:24.842
One hundred billion strands of magnetic field inside this three-inch disk.

00:06:24.842 --> 00:06:28.946
But that's not the amazing part yet, because there is something I haven't told you yet.

00:06:28.946 --> 00:06:34.562
And, yeah, the amazing part is that this superconductor that you see here

00:06:34.562 --> 00:06:42.087
is only half a micron thick. It's extremely thin.

00:06:42.087 --> 00:06:51.649
And this extremely thin layer is able to levitate more than 70,000 times its own weight.

00:06:51.649 --> 00:06:57.482
It's a remarkable effect. It's very strong.

00:06:57.482 --> 00:07:01.059
Now, I can extend this circular magnet,

00:07:01.059 --> 00:07:05.840
and make whatever track I want.

00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:09.769
For example, I can make a large circular rail here.

00:07:09.769 --> 00:07:16.652
And when I place the superconducting disk on top of this rail,

00:07:16.652 --> 00:07:20.761
it moves freely.

00:07:20.761 --> 00:07:30.142
(Applause)

00:07:30.142 --> 00:07:34.883
And again, that's not all. I can adjust its position like this, and rotate,

00:07:34.883 --> 00:07:41.324
and it freely moves in this new position.

00:07:41.324 --> 00:07:45.762
And I can even try a new thing; let's try it for the first time.

00:07:45.762 --> 00:07:51.706
I can take this disk and put it here,

00:07:51.706 --> 00:07:54.690
and while it stays here -- don't move --

00:07:54.690 --> 00:08:01.248
I will try to rotate the track,

00:08:01.248 --> 00:08:03.547
and hopefully, if I did it correctly,

00:08:03.547 --> 00:08:05.690
it stays suspended.

00:08:05.690 --> 00:08:15.139
(Applause)

00:08:15.139 --> 00:08:21.980
You see, it's quantum locking, not levitation.

00:08:21.980 --> 00:08:26.115
Now, while I'll let it circulate for a little more,

00:08:26.115 --> 00:08:29.818
let me tell you a little bit about superconductors.

00:08:29.818 --> 00:08:35.364
Now -- (Laughter) --

00:08:35.364 --> 00:08:42.387
So we now know that we are able to transfer enormous amount of currents inside superconductors,

00:08:42.387 --> 00:08:47.610
so we can use them to produce strong magnetic fields,

00:08:47.610 --> 00:08:52.796
such as needed in MRI machines, particle accelerators and so on.

00:08:52.796 --> 00:08:57.356
But we can also store energy using superconductors,

00:08:57.356 --> 00:08:59.245
because we have no dissipation.

00:08:59.245 --> 00:09:06.427
And we could also produce power cables, to transfer enormous amounts of current between power stations.

00:09:06.427 --> 00:09:15.433
Imagine you could back up a single power station with a single superconducting cable.

00:09:15.433 --> 00:09:19.909
But what is the future of quantum levitation and quantum locking?

00:09:19.909 --> 00:09:27.048
Well, let me answer this simple question by giving you an example.

00:09:27.048 --> 00:09:33.461
Imagine you would have a disk similar to the one I have here in my hand,

00:09:33.461 --> 00:09:37.340
three-inch diameter, with a single difference.

00:09:37.340 --> 00:09:42.525
The superconducting layer, instead of being half a micron thin,

00:09:42.525 --> 00:09:45.613
being two millimeters thin, quite thin.

00:09:45.613 --> 00:09:56.348
This two-millimeter-thin superconducting layer could hold 1,000 kilograms, a small car, in my hand.

00:09:56.348 --> 00:09:59.644
Amazing. Thank you.

00:09:59.644 --> 00:10:14.724
(Applause)
