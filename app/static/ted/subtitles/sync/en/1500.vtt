00:11:18.103 --> 00:11:19.670
Chris Anderson: You guys were amazing.

00:11:19.670 --> 00:11:21.422
That's amazing.

00:11:21.422 --> 00:11:24.960
(Applause)

00:11:24.960 --> 00:11:26.590
You just don't hear that every day.

00:11:26.590 --> 00:11:28.541
(Laughter)

00:11:28.541 --> 00:11:30.942
Usman, the official story is that

00:11:30.942 --> 00:11:32.422
you learned to play the guitar

00:11:32.422 --> 00:11:34.405
by watching Jimmy Page on YouTube.

00:11:34.405 --> 00:11:37.577
Usman Riaz: Yes, that was the first one. And then I --

00:11:37.577 --> 00:11:39.873
That was the first thing I learned,

00:11:39.873 --> 00:11:42.504
and then I started progressing to other things.

00:11:42.504 --> 00:11:45.543
And I started watching Kaki King a lot,

00:11:45.543 --> 00:11:49.296
and she would always cite Preston Reed as a big influence,

00:11:49.296 --> 00:11:51.440
so then I started watching his videos,

00:11:51.440 --> 00:11:54.684
and it's very surreal right now to be --

00:11:54.684 --> 00:11:56.845
(Laughter)

00:11:56.845 --> 00:12:01.545
(Applause)

00:12:01.545 --> 00:12:03.317
CA: Was that piece just now,

00:12:03.317 --> 00:12:06.507
that was one of his songs that you learned, or how did that happen?

00:12:06.507 --> 00:12:07.603
UR: I'd never learned it before,

00:12:07.603 --> 00:12:10.620
but he told me that we would be playing that on stage,

00:12:10.620 --> 00:12:15.011
so I was familiar with it, so that's why I had so much more fun learning it.

00:12:15.011 --> 00:12:17.699
And it finally happened, so ...

00:12:17.699 --> 00:12:19.151
(Laughter)

00:12:19.151 --> 00:12:20.603
CA: Preston, from your point of view,

00:12:20.603 --> 00:12:22.467
I mean, you invented this like 20 years ago, right?

00:12:22.467 --> 00:12:25.315
How does it feel to see someone like this

00:12:25.315 --> 00:12:30.015
come along taking your art and doing so much with it?

00:12:30.015 --> 00:12:32.364
Preston Reed: It's mind-blowing,

00:12:32.364 --> 00:12:35.659
and I feel really proud, really honored.

00:12:35.659 --> 00:12:41.163
And he's a wonderful musician, so it's cool.

00:12:41.163 --> 00:12:44.083
(Laughter)

00:12:44.083 --> 00:12:49.395
CA: I guess, I don't think there is like a one-minute other piece you guys can do?

00:12:49.395 --> 00:12:51.827
Can you? Do you jam? Do you have anything else?

00:12:51.827 --> 00:12:54.609
PR: We haven't prepared anything.

00:12:54.609 --> 00:12:58.923
CA: There isn't. I'll tell you what.

00:12:58.923 --> 00:13:02.484
If you have another 30 or 40 seconds,

00:13:02.484 --> 00:13:03.907
and you have another 30 or 40 seconds,

00:13:03.907 --> 00:13:05.435
and we just see that, I just think --

00:13:05.435 --> 00:13:08.251
I can feel it. We want to hear a little more.

00:13:08.251 --> 00:13:10.163
And if it goes horribly wrong, no worries.

00:13:10.163 --> 00:13:13.595
(Applause)

00:13:13.595 --> 00:13:21.595
(Laughter)

00:13:27.479 --> 00:16:14.010

00:16:14.010 --> 00:16:28.707
