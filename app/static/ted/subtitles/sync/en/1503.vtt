WEBVTT

00:00:12.787 --> 00:00:14.242
I'm going to start with a little story.

00:00:14.242 --> 00:00:17.354
So, I grew up in this neighborhood. When I was 15 years old,

00:00:17.354 --> 00:00:21.905
I went from being what I think was a strapping young athlete,

00:00:21.905 --> 00:00:25.866
over four months, slowly wasting away until

00:00:25.866 --> 00:00:27.754
I was basically a famine victim

00:00:27.754 --> 00:00:29.778
with an unquenchable thirst.

00:00:29.778 --> 00:00:33.387
I had basically digested away my body.

00:00:33.387 --> 00:00:37.681
And this all came to a head when I was on a backpacking trip,

00:00:37.681 --> 00:00:39.726
my first one ever actually, on Old Rag Mountain

00:00:39.726 --> 00:00:43.710
in West Virginia, and was putting my face into puddles

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.966
of water and drinking like a dog.

00:00:45.966 --> 00:00:50.478
That night, I was taken into the emergency room

00:00:50.478 --> 00:00:54.359
and diagnosed as a type 1 diabetic in full-blown ketoacidosis.

00:00:54.359 --> 00:01:00.294
And I recovered, thanks to the miracles of modern medicine,

00:01:00.294 --> 00:01:05.750
insulin and other things, and gained all my weight back and more.

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:11.261
And something festered inside me after this happened.

00:01:11.261 --> 00:01:14.774
What I thought about was, what caused the diabetes?

00:01:14.774 --> 00:01:16.627
You see, diabetes is an autoimmune disease

00:01:16.627 --> 00:01:20.002
where your body fights itself, and at the time people thought

00:01:20.002 --> 00:01:23.043
that somehow maybe exposure to a pathogen

00:01:23.043 --> 00:01:27.515
had triggered my immune system to fight the pathogen

00:01:27.515 --> 00:01:29.573
and then kill the cells that make insulin.

00:01:29.573 --> 00:01:31.883
And this is what I thought for a long period of time,

00:01:31.883 --> 00:01:35.931
and that's in fact what medicine and people have focused on quite a bit,

00:01:35.931 --> 00:01:38.853
the microbes that do bad things.

00:01:38.853 --> 00:01:41.921
And that's where I need my assistant here now.

00:01:41.921 --> 00:01:44.359
You may recognize her.

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:50.039
So, I went yesterday, I apologize, I skipped a few of the talks,

00:01:50.039 --> 00:01:52.280
and I went over to the National Academy of Sciences building,

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:57.727
and they sell toys, giant microbes.

00:01:57.727 --> 00:02:01.112
And here we go!

00:02:01.112 --> 00:02:05.867
So you have caught flesh-eating disease if you caught that one.

00:02:05.867 --> 00:02:10.295
I gotta get back out my baseball ability here.

00:02:10.295 --> 00:02:14.002
(Laughter)

00:02:14.002 --> 00:02:20.383
So, unfortunately or not surprisingly, most of the microbes

00:02:20.383 --> 00:02:23.726
they sell at the National Academy building are pathogens.

00:02:23.726 --> 00:02:26.695
Everybody focuses on the things that kill us,

00:02:26.695 --> 00:02:28.342
and that's what I was focusing on.

00:02:28.342 --> 00:02:32.903
And it turns out that we are covered in a cloud of microbes,

00:02:32.903 --> 00:02:37.423
and those microbes actually do us good much of the time,

00:02:37.423 --> 00:02:38.543
rather than killing us.

00:02:38.543 --> 00:02:41.734
And so, we've known about this for some period of time.

00:02:41.734 --> 00:02:45.311
People have used microscopes to look at the microbes that cover us,

00:02:45.311 --> 00:02:47.103
I know you're not paying attention to me, but ...

00:02:47.103 --> 00:02:49.201
(Laughter)

00:02:49.201 --> 00:02:51.143
The microbes that cover us.

00:02:51.143 --> 00:02:54.303
And if you look at them in the microscope,

00:02:54.303 --> 00:02:57.707
you can see that we actually have 10 times as many cells

00:02:57.707 --> 00:03:01.175
of microbes on us as we have human cells.

00:03:01.175 --> 00:03:05.926
There's more mass in the microbes than the mass of our brain.

00:03:05.926 --> 00:03:10.247
We are literally a teeming ecosystem of microorganisms.

00:03:10.247 --> 00:03:14.847
And unfortunately, if you want to learn about the microorganisms,

00:03:14.847 --> 00:03:17.127
just looking at them in a microscope is not sufficient.

00:03:17.127 --> 00:03:19.707
And so we just heard about the DNA sequencing.

00:03:19.707 --> 00:03:22.235
It turns out that one of the best ways to look at microbes

00:03:22.235 --> 00:03:24.771
and to understand them is to look at their DNA.

00:03:24.771 --> 00:03:26.913
And that's what I've been doing for 20 years,

00:03:26.913 --> 00:03:30.795
using DNA sequencing, collecting samples from various places,

00:03:30.795 --> 00:03:33.699
including the human body, reading the DNA sequence

00:03:33.699 --> 00:03:36.319
and then using that DNA sequencing to tell us about

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:38.485
the microbes that are in a particular place.

00:03:38.485 --> 00:03:41.348
And what's amazing, when you use this technology,

00:03:41.348 --> 00:03:44.508
for example, looking at humans, we're not just covered

00:03:44.508 --> 00:03:45.644
in a sea of microbes.

00:03:45.644 --> 00:03:50.755
There are thousands upon thousands of different kinds of microbes on us.

00:03:50.755 --> 00:03:56.108
We have millions of genes of microbes in our human

00:03:56.108 --> 00:03:57.755
microbiome covering us.

00:03:57.755 --> 00:04:01.260
And so this microbial diversity differs between people,

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:04.396
and what people have been thinking about in the last 10,

00:04:04.396 --> 00:04:07.516
maybe 15 years is, maybe these microbes,

00:04:07.516 --> 00:04:09.564
this microbial cloud in and on us,

00:04:09.564 --> 00:04:13.444
and the variation between us, may be responsible

00:04:13.444 --> 00:04:17.014
for some of the health and illness differences between us.

00:04:17.014 --> 00:04:20.137
And that comes back to the diabetes story I was telling you.

00:04:20.137 --> 00:04:23.543
It turns out that people now think that one of the triggers

00:04:23.543 --> 00:04:25.924
for type 1 diabetes is not fighting a pathogen,

00:04:25.924 --> 00:04:30.315
but is in fact trying to -- miscommunicating with the microbes

00:04:30.315 --> 00:04:31.812
that live in and on you.

00:04:31.812 --> 00:04:34.516
And somehow maybe the microbial community that's

00:04:34.516 --> 00:04:38.549
in and on me got off, and then this triggered some sort

00:04:38.549 --> 00:04:40.788
of immune response and led to me killing the cells

00:04:40.788 --> 00:04:43.009
that make insulin in my body.

00:04:43.009 --> 00:04:46.105
And so what I want to tell you about for a few minutes is,

00:04:46.105 --> 00:04:49.897
what people have learned using DNA sequencing techniques

00:04:49.897 --> 00:04:53.556
in particular, to study the microbial cloud

00:04:53.556 --> 00:04:55.130
that lives in and on us.

00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:57.594
And I want to tell you a story about a personal project.

00:04:57.594 --> 00:05:00.388
My first personal experience with studying the microbes

00:05:00.388 --> 00:05:04.538
on the human body actually came from a talk that I gave,

00:05:04.538 --> 00:05:06.338
right around the corner from here at Georgetown.

00:05:06.338 --> 00:05:09.355
I gave a talk, and a family friend who happened to be

00:05:09.355 --> 00:05:11.898
the Dean of Georgetown Medical School was at the talk,

00:05:11.898 --> 00:05:14.388
and came up to me afterwards saying, they were doing

00:05:14.388 --> 00:05:17.738
a study of ileal transplants in people.

00:05:17.738 --> 00:05:21.714
And they wanted to look at the microbes after the transplants.

00:05:21.714 --> 00:05:24.778
And so I started a collaboration with this person,

00:05:24.778 --> 00:05:28.051
Michael Zasloff and Thomas Fishbein, to look at the microbes

00:05:28.051 --> 00:05:32.524
that colonized these ilea after they were transplanted into a recipient.

00:05:32.524 --> 00:05:35.666
And I can tell you all the details about the microbial study

00:05:35.666 --> 00:05:37.916
that we did there, but the reason I want to tell you this story

00:05:37.916 --> 00:05:41.140
is something really striking that they did at the beginning

00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:42.163
of this project.

00:05:42.163 --> 00:05:46.528
They take the donor ileum, which is filled with microbes from a donor

00:05:46.528 --> 00:05:48.811
and they have a recipient who might have a problem

00:05:48.811 --> 00:05:51.436
with their microbial community, say Crohn's disease,

00:05:51.436 --> 00:05:54.996
and they sterilized the donor ileum.

00:05:54.996 --> 00:05:59.291
Cleaned out all the microbes, and then put it in the recipient.

00:05:59.291 --> 00:06:01.955
They did this because this was common practice

00:06:01.955 --> 00:06:05.084
in medicine, even though it was obvious

00:06:05.084 --> 00:06:07.222
that this was not a good idea.

00:06:07.222 --> 00:06:10.227
And fortunately, in the course of this project,

00:06:10.227 --> 00:06:12.790
the transplant surgeons and the other people

00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:17.211
decided, forget common practice. We have to switch.

00:06:17.211 --> 00:06:21.356
So they actually switched to leaving some of the microbial

00:06:21.356 --> 00:06:25.356
community in the ileum. They leave the microbes with the donor,

00:06:25.356 --> 00:06:28.932
and theoretically that might help the people who are

00:06:28.932 --> 00:06:31.021
receiving this ileal transplant.

00:06:31.021 --> 00:06:34.323
And so, people -- this is a study that I did now.

00:06:34.323 --> 00:06:36.628
In the last few years there's been a great expansion

00:06:36.628 --> 00:06:40.806
in using DNA technology to study the microbes in and on people.

00:06:40.806 --> 00:06:42.614
There's something called the Human Microbiome Project

00:06:42.614 --> 00:06:44.470
that's going on in the United States,

00:06:44.470 --> 00:06:47.004
and MetaHIT going on in Europe, and a lot of other projects.

00:06:47.004 --> 00:06:50.193
And when people have done a variety of studies,

00:06:50.193 --> 00:06:53.825
they have learned things such as, when a baby is

00:06:53.825 --> 00:06:56.809
born, during vaginal delivery you get colonized by the

00:06:56.809 --> 00:06:58.001
microbes from your mother.

00:06:58.001 --> 00:07:01.057
There are risk factors associated with cesarean sections,

00:07:01.057 --> 00:07:05.088
some of those risk factors may be due to mis-colonization

00:07:05.088 --> 00:07:07.480
when you carve a baby out of its mother

00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:10.305
rather than being delivered through the birth canal.

00:07:10.305 --> 00:07:13.754
And a variety of other studies have shown that the

00:07:13.754 --> 00:07:15.561
microbial community that lives in and on us

00:07:15.561 --> 00:07:17.824
helps in development of the immune system,

00:07:17.824 --> 00:07:22.769
helps in fighting off pathogens, helps in our metabolism,

00:07:22.769 --> 00:07:25.849
and determining our metabolic rate, probably

00:07:25.849 --> 00:07:29.024
determines our odor, and may even shape our behavior

00:07:29.024 --> 00:07:30.960
in a variety of ways.

00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:34.016
And so, these studies have documented or suggested

00:07:34.016 --> 00:07:38.303
out of a variety of important functions for the microbial community,

00:07:38.303 --> 00:07:42.840
this cloud, the non-pathogens that live in and on us.

00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:46.424
And one area that I think is very interesting,

00:07:46.424 --> 00:07:49.090
which many of you may have now that we've thrown

00:07:49.090 --> 00:07:53.020
microbes into the crowd, is something that I would call "germophobia."

00:07:53.020 --> 00:07:55.979
So people are really into cleanliness, right?

00:07:55.979 --> 00:07:57.958
We have antibiotics in our kitchen counters,

00:07:57.958 --> 00:08:01.054
people are washing every part of them all of the time,

00:08:01.054 --> 00:08:06.080
we pump antibiotics into our food, into our communities,

00:08:06.080 --> 00:08:08.521
we take antibiotics excessively.

00:08:08.521 --> 00:08:12.360
And killing pathogens is a good thing if you're sick,

00:08:12.360 --> 00:08:15.624
but we should understand that when we pump chemicals

00:08:15.624 --> 00:08:18.521
and antibiotics into our world, that we're also killing

00:08:18.521 --> 00:08:20.816
the cloud of microbes that live in and on us.

00:08:20.816 --> 00:08:23.816
And excessive use of antibiotics, in particular in children,

00:08:23.816 --> 00:08:27.045
has been shown to be associated with, again, risk factors

00:08:27.045 --> 00:08:31.301
for obesity, for autoimmune diseases, for a variety

00:08:31.301 --> 00:08:33.205
of problems that are probably due to disruption

00:08:33.205 --> 00:08:36.309
of the microbial community.

00:08:36.309 --> 00:08:39.661
So the microbial community can go wrong

00:08:39.661 --> 00:08:41.373
whether we want it to or not,

00:08:41.373 --> 00:08:43.621
or we can kill it with antibiotics,

00:08:43.621 --> 00:08:45.717
but what can we do to restore it?

00:08:45.717 --> 00:08:48.829
I'm sure many people here have heard about probiotics.

00:08:48.829 --> 00:08:51.837
Probiotics are one thing that you can try and do to restore

00:08:51.837 --> 00:08:54.261
the microbial community that is in and on you.

00:08:54.261 --> 00:08:57.733
And they definitely have been shown to be effective in some cases.

00:08:57.733 --> 00:09:00.830
There's a project going on at UC Davis where people are using

00:09:00.830 --> 00:09:03.725
probiotics to try and treat, prevent,

00:09:03.725 --> 00:09:06.237
necrotizing enterocolitis in premature infants.

00:09:06.237 --> 00:09:09.645
Premature infants have real problems with their microbial community.

00:09:09.645 --> 00:09:12.165
And it may be that probiotics can help prevent

00:09:12.165 --> 00:09:15.301
the development of this horrible necrotizing enterocolitis

00:09:15.301 --> 00:09:16.966
in these premature infants.

00:09:16.966 --> 00:09:20.957
But probiotics are sort of a very, very simple solution.

00:09:20.957 --> 00:09:24.312
Most of the pills that you can take or the yogurts that you can eat

00:09:24.312 --> 00:09:29.099
have one or two species in them, maybe five species in them,

00:09:29.099 --> 00:09:32.765
and the human community is thousands upon thousands of species.

00:09:32.765 --> 00:09:36.693
So what can we do to restore our microbial community

00:09:36.693 --> 00:09:39.892
when we have thousands and thousands of species on us?

00:09:39.892 --> 00:09:42.598
Well, one thing that animals seem to do is,

00:09:42.598 --> 00:09:46.612
they eat poo -- coprophagia.

00:09:46.612 --> 00:09:51.221
And it turns out that many veterinarians,

00:09:51.221 --> 00:09:53.230
old school veterinarians in particular,

00:09:53.230 --> 00:09:55.946
have been doing something called "poo tea,"

00:09:55.946 --> 00:10:01.751
not booty, but poo tea, to treat colic and other

00:10:01.751 --> 00:10:05.374
ailments in horses and cows and things like that,

00:10:05.374 --> 00:10:09.322
where you make tea from the poo from a healthy

00:10:09.322 --> 00:10:12.471
individual animal and you feed it to a sick animal.

00:10:12.471 --> 00:10:16.911
Although, unless you have a fistulated cow with a big hole in its side,

00:10:16.911 --> 00:10:19.450
and you can put your hand into its rumen,

00:10:19.450 --> 00:10:22.858
it's hard to imagine that the delivery of microbes

00:10:22.858 --> 00:10:25.787
directly into the mouth and through the entire

00:10:25.787 --> 00:10:29.435
top of the digestive tract is the best delivery system,

00:10:29.435 --> 00:10:33.555
so you may have heard in people they are now doing

00:10:33.555 --> 00:10:38.205
fecal transplants, where rather than delivering

00:10:38.205 --> 00:10:40.637
a couple of probiotic microbes through the mouth,

00:10:40.637 --> 00:10:44.090
they are delivering a community of probiotics,

00:10:44.090 --> 00:10:46.570
a community of microbes from a healthy donor,

00:10:46.570 --> 00:10:48.707
through the other end.

00:10:48.707 --> 00:10:52.037
And this has turned out to be very effective in fighting

00:10:52.037 --> 00:10:54.403
certain intransigent infectious diseases

00:10:54.403 --> 00:10:58.242
like Clostridium difficile infections that can stay

00:10:58.242 --> 00:11:00.339
with people for years and years and years.

00:11:00.339 --> 00:11:05.202
Transplants of the feces, of the microbes from the feces,

00:11:05.202 --> 00:11:08.067
from a healthy donor has actually been shown to cure

00:11:08.067 --> 00:11:10.928
systemic C. dif infections in some people.

00:11:10.928 --> 00:11:16.770
Now what these transplants, these fecal transplants, or

00:11:16.770 --> 00:11:21.229
the poo tea suggest to me, and many other people

00:11:21.229 --> 00:11:22.973
have come up with this same idea, is that

00:11:22.973 --> 00:11:26.861
the microbial community in and on us, it's an organ.

00:11:26.861 --> 00:11:31.868
We should view it as a functioning organ, part of ourselves.

00:11:31.868 --> 00:11:35.859
We should treat it carefully and with respect,

00:11:35.859 --> 00:11:39.839
and we do not want to mess with it, say by C-sections

00:11:39.839 --> 00:11:44.747
or by antibiotics or excessive cleanliness,

00:11:44.747 --> 00:11:47.964
without some real good justification.

00:11:47.964 --> 00:11:51.604
And what the DNA sequencing technologies are allowing people to do now

00:11:51.604 --> 00:11:58.556
is do detailed studies of, say, 100 patients who have Crohn's disease

00:11:58.556 --> 00:12:01.091
and 100 people who don't have Crohn's disease.

00:12:01.091 --> 00:12:04.924
Or 100 people who took antibiotics when they were little,

00:12:04.924 --> 00:12:07.348
and 100 people who did not take antibiotics.

00:12:07.348 --> 00:12:11.428
And we can now start to compare the community of microbes

00:12:11.428 --> 00:12:14.731
and their genes and see if there are differences.

00:12:14.731 --> 00:12:18.133
And eventually we may be able to understand if they're not

00:12:18.133 --> 00:12:20.757
just correlative differences, but causative.

00:12:20.757 --> 00:12:24.227
Studies in model systems like mouse and other animals

00:12:24.227 --> 00:12:27.436
are also helping do this, but people are now using

00:12:27.436 --> 00:12:29.740
these technologies because they've gotten very cheap,

00:12:29.740 --> 00:12:33.654
to study the microbes in and on a variety of people.

00:12:33.654 --> 00:12:38.244
So, in wrapping up, what I want to tell you about is,

00:12:38.244 --> 00:12:41.451
I didn't tell you a part of the story of coming down with diabetes.

00:12:41.451 --> 00:12:44.215
It turns out that my father was an M.D.,

00:12:44.215 --> 00:12:48.687
actually studied hormones. I told him many times

00:12:48.687 --> 00:12:53.477
that I was tired, thirsty, not feeling very good.

00:12:53.477 --> 00:12:56.356
And he shrugged it off, I think he either thought

00:12:56.356 --> 00:12:59.635
I was just complaining a lot, or it was the typical

00:12:59.635 --> 00:13:02.254
M.D. "nothing can be wrong with my children."

00:13:02.254 --> 00:13:05.475
We even went to the International Society of Endocrinology

00:13:05.475 --> 00:13:07.605
meeting as family in Quebec.

00:13:07.605 --> 00:13:13.099
And I was getting up every five minutes to pee,

00:13:13.099 --> 00:13:15.534
and drinking everybody's water at the table,

00:13:15.534 --> 00:13:18.468
and I think they all thought I was a druggie.

00:13:18.468 --> 00:13:20.188
(Laughter)

00:13:20.188 --> 00:13:22.164
But the reason I'm telling you this is that

00:13:22.164 --> 00:13:25.164
the medical community, my father as an example,

00:13:25.164 --> 00:13:28.731
sometimes doesn't see what's right in front of their eyes.

00:13:28.731 --> 00:13:32.716
The microbial cloud, it is right in front of us.

00:13:32.716 --> 00:13:35.516
We can't see it most of the time. It's invisible.

00:13:35.516 --> 00:13:36.987
They're microbes. They're tiny.

00:13:36.987 --> 00:13:39.939
But we can see them through their DNA,

00:13:39.939 --> 00:13:43.188
we can see them through the effects that they have on people.

00:13:43.188 --> 00:13:44.806
And what we need now

00:13:44.806 --> 00:13:48.475
is to start thinking about this microbial community in the context

00:13:48.475 --> 00:13:50.988
of everything in human medicine.

00:13:50.988 --> 00:13:54.055
It doesn't mean that it affects every part of us,

00:13:54.055 --> 00:13:55.454
but it might.

00:13:55.454 --> 00:13:59.379
What we need is a full field guide to the microbes

00:13:59.379 --> 00:14:02.772
that live in and on people, so that we can understand

00:14:02.772 --> 00:14:06.044
what they're doing to our lives.

00:14:06.044 --> 00:14:09.115
We are them. They are us.

00:14:09.115 --> 00:14:10.443
Thank you.

00:14:10.443 --> 00:14:12.428
(Applause)
