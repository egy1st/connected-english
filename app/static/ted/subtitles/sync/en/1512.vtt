00:00:13.162 --> 00:00:16.341
Well, I was born with a rare visual condition

00:00:16.341 --> 00:00:20.054
called achromatopsia, which is total color blindness,

00:00:20.054 --> 00:00:21.924
so I've never seen color,

00:00:21.924 --> 00:00:24.447
and I don't know what color looks like,

00:00:24.447 --> 00:00:27.422
because I come from a grayscale world.

00:00:27.422 --> 00:00:30.082
To me, the sky is always gray,

00:00:30.082 --> 00:00:31.934
flowers are always gray,

00:00:31.934 --> 00:00:34.136
and television is still in black and white.

00:00:34.136 --> 00:00:36.429
But, since the age of 21,

00:00:36.429 --> 00:00:40.558
instead of seeing color, I can hear color.

00:00:40.558 --> 00:00:43.534
In 2003, I started a project

00:00:43.534 --> 00:00:46.222
with computer scientist Adam Montandon,

00:00:46.222 --> 00:00:49.389
and the result, with further collaborations

00:00:49.389 --> 00:00:52.237
with Peter Kese from Slovenia

00:00:52.237 --> 00:00:54.270
and Matias Lizana from Barcelona,

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.635
is this electronic eye.

00:00:56.635 --> 00:00:58.991
It's a color sensor that detects

00:00:58.991 --> 00:01:02.574
the color frequency in front of me — (Frequency sounds) —

00:01:02.574 --> 00:01:04.926
and sends this frequency to a chip installed

00:01:04.926 --> 00:01:07.917
at the back of my head, and I hear the color in front of me

00:01:07.917 --> 00:01:10.813
through the bone, through bone conduction.

00:01:10.813 --> 00:01:14.321
(Frequency sounds) So, for example, if I have, like —

00:01:17.874 --> 00:01:20.841
This is the sound of purple. (Frequency sounds)

00:01:20.841 --> 00:01:28.259
For example, this is the sound of grass. (Frequency sounds)

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:30.384
This is red, like TED. (Frequency sounds)

00:01:30.384 --> 00:01:34.753
This is the sound of a dirty sock. (Laughter)

00:01:34.753 --> 00:01:36.630
Which is like yellow, this one.

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:40.687
So I've been hearing color all the time for eight years,

00:01:40.687 --> 00:01:43.322
since 2004, so I find it completely normal now

00:01:43.322 --> 00:01:45.801
to hear color all the time.

00:01:45.801 --> 00:01:50.175
At the start, though, I had to memorize the names you give

00:01:50.175 --> 00:01:52.581
for each color, so I had to memorize the notes,

00:01:52.581 --> 00:01:54.517
but after some time, all this information

00:01:54.517 --> 00:01:56.510
became a perception.

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:58.269
I didn't have to think about the notes.

00:01:58.269 --> 00:02:00.894
And after some time, this perception became a feeling.

00:02:00.894 --> 00:02:02.900
I started to have favorite colors,

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:04.674
and I started to dream in colors.

00:02:04.674 --> 00:02:08.949
So, when I started to dream in color is when I felt

00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:11.836
that the software and my brain had united,

00:02:11.836 --> 00:02:14.792
because in my dreams, it was my brain creating

00:02:14.792 --> 00:02:17.153
electronic sounds. It wasn't the software,

00:02:17.153 --> 00:02:20.672
so that's when I started to feel like a cyborg.

00:02:20.672 --> 00:02:23.722
It's when I started to feel that the cybernetic device

00:02:23.722 --> 00:02:25.912
was no longer a device.

00:02:25.912 --> 00:02:28.327
It had become a part of my body,

00:02:28.327 --> 00:02:30.792
an extension of my senses,

00:02:30.792 --> 00:02:33.418
and after some time, it even became a part

00:02:33.418 --> 00:02:36.945
of my official image.

00:02:36.945 --> 00:02:39.291
This is my passport from 2004.

00:02:39.291 --> 00:02:42.376
You're not allowed to appear on U.K. passports

00:02:42.376 --> 00:02:45.188
with electronic equipment, but I insisted

00:02:45.188 --> 00:02:47.589
to the passport office that what they were seeing

00:02:47.589 --> 00:02:50.093
was actually a new part of my body,

00:02:50.093 --> 00:02:53.613
an extension of my brain, and they finally accepted me

00:02:53.613 --> 00:02:56.124
to appear with the passport photo.

00:02:56.124 --> 00:02:59.581
So, life has changed dramatically since I hear color,

00:02:59.581 --> 00:03:02.175
because color is almost everywhere,

00:03:02.175 --> 00:03:05.052
so the biggest change for example is

00:03:05.052 --> 00:03:09.590
going to an art gallery, I can listen to a Picasso,

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:12.444
for example. So it's like I'm going to a concert hall,

00:03:12.444 --> 00:03:14.655
because I can listen to the paintings.

00:03:14.655 --> 00:03:17.116
And supermarkets, I find this is very shocking,

00:03:17.116 --> 00:03:20.066
it's very, very attractive to walk along a supermarket.

00:03:20.066 --> 00:03:21.554
It's like going to a nightclub.

00:03:21.554 --> 00:03:24.810
It's full of different melodies. (Laughter) Yeah.

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:26.885
Especially the aisle with cleaning products.

00:03:26.885 --> 00:03:30.236
It's just fabulous. (Laughter)

00:03:30.236 --> 00:03:32.708
Also, the way I dress has changed.

00:03:32.708 --> 00:03:35.116
Before, I used to dress in a way that it looked good.

00:03:35.116 --> 00:03:39.693
Now I dress in a way that it sounds good. (Laughter)

00:03:39.693 --> 00:03:44.824
(Applause)

00:03:44.824 --> 00:03:47.333
So today I'm dressed in C major,

00:03:47.333 --> 00:03:50.642
so it's quite a happy chord. (Laughter)

00:03:50.642 --> 00:03:52.516
If I had to go to a funeral, though,

00:03:52.516 --> 00:03:55.083
I would dress in B minor, which would be

00:03:55.083 --> 00:04:03.842
turquoise, purple and orange. (Laughter)

00:04:03.842 --> 00:04:08.187
Also, food, the way I look at food has changed,

00:04:08.187 --> 00:04:11.643
because now I can display the food on a plate,

00:04:11.643 --> 00:04:14.595
so I can eat my favorite song. (Laughter)

00:04:14.595 --> 00:04:15.824
So depending on how I display it,

00:04:15.824 --> 00:04:18.574
I can hear and I can compose music with food.

00:04:18.574 --> 00:04:21.299
So imagine a restaurant where we can have, like,

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:24.283
Lady Gaga salads as starters. (Laughter) I mean,

00:04:24.283 --> 00:04:27.300
this would get teenagers to eat their vegetables, probably.

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:30.739
And also, some Rachmaninov piano concertos

00:04:30.739 --> 00:04:33.973
as main dishes, and some Bjork or Madonna desserts,

00:04:33.973 --> 00:04:37.082
that would be a very exciting restaurant

00:04:37.082 --> 00:04:39.842
where you can actually eat songs.

00:04:39.842 --> 00:04:44.292
Also, the way I perceive beauty has changed,

00:04:44.292 --> 00:04:48.972
because when I look at someone, I hear their face,

00:04:48.972 --> 00:04:53.974
so someone might look very beautiful but sound terrible.

00:04:53.974 --> 00:04:55.735
(Laughter) And it might happen the opposite,

00:04:55.735 --> 00:04:57.983
the other way around. So I really enjoy creating, like,

00:04:57.983 --> 00:04:59.712
sound portraits of people.

00:04:59.712 --> 00:05:03.352
Instead of drawing someone's face, like drawing the shape,

00:05:03.352 --> 00:05:05.783
I point at them with the eye and I write down

00:05:05.783 --> 00:05:09.054
the different notes I hear, and then I create sound portraits.

00:05:09.054 --> 00:05:10.791
Here's some faces.

00:05:10.791 --> 00:05:25.318
(Musical chords)

00:05:25.318 --> 00:05:28.751
Yeah, Nicole Kidman sounds good. (Laughter)

00:05:28.751 --> 00:05:31.800
Some people, I would never relate, but they sound similar.

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:34.598
Prince Charles has some similarities with Nicole Kidman.

00:05:34.598 --> 00:05:36.735
They have similar sound of eyes.

00:05:36.735 --> 00:05:38.783
So you relate people that you wouldn't relate,

00:05:38.783 --> 00:05:42.296
and you can actually also create concerts

00:05:42.296 --> 00:05:44.936
by looking at the audience faces.

00:05:44.936 --> 00:05:48.032
So I connect the eye, and then I play the audience's faces.

00:05:48.032 --> 00:05:49.536
The good thing about this is,

00:05:49.536 --> 00:05:52.503
if the concert doesn't sound good, it's their fault.

00:05:52.503 --> 00:05:54.774
It's not my fault, because — (Laughter)

00:05:54.774 --> 00:05:59.081
And so another thing that happens is that

00:05:59.081 --> 00:06:01.958
I started having this secondary effect

00:06:01.958 --> 00:06:05.288
that normal sounds started to become color.

00:06:05.288 --> 00:06:09.049
I heard a telephone tone, and it felt green

00:06:09.049 --> 00:06:11.375
because it sounded just like the color green.

00:06:11.375 --> 00:06:14.673
The BBC beeps, they sound turquoise,

00:06:14.673 --> 00:06:17.800
and listening to Mozart became a yellow experience,

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:22.560
so I started to paint music and paint people's voices,

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:24.503
because people's voices have frequencies

00:06:24.503 --> 00:06:26.046
that I relate to color.

00:06:26.046 --> 00:06:31.165
And here's some music translated into color.

00:06:31.165 --> 00:06:36.365
For example, Mozart, "Queen of the Night," looks like this.

00:06:36.365 --> 00:06:38.177
(Music) Very yellow and very colorful,

00:06:38.177 --> 00:06:40.367
because there's many different frequencies.

00:06:40.367 --> 00:06:43.277
(Music)

00:06:44.293 --> 00:06:46.607
And this is a completely different song.

00:06:46.607 --> 00:06:50.538
(Music) It's Justin Bieber's "Baby." (Laughter)

00:06:50.538 --> 00:06:52.269
(Music)

00:06:52.269 --> 00:06:55.839
It is very pink and very yellow.

00:06:55.839 --> 00:07:03.006
So, also voices, I can transform speeches into color,

00:07:03.006 --> 00:07:06.550
for example, these are two very well-known speeches.

00:07:06.550 --> 00:07:10.287
One of them is Martin Luther King's "I Have A Dream,"

00:07:10.287 --> 00:07:11.739
and the other one is Hitler.

00:07:11.739 --> 00:07:15.215
And I like to exhibit these paintings in the exhibition halls

00:07:15.215 --> 00:07:17.791
without labels, and then I ask people,

00:07:17.791 --> 00:07:19.638
"Which one do you prefer?"

00:07:19.638 --> 00:07:21.903
And most people change their preference

00:07:21.903 --> 00:07:24.814
when I tell them that the one on the left is Hitler

00:07:24.814 --> 00:07:27.934
and the one on the right is Martin Luther King.

00:07:27.934 --> 00:07:33.673
So I got to a point when I was able to perceive 360 colors,

00:07:33.673 --> 00:07:35.258
just like human vision.

00:07:35.258 --> 00:07:38.853
I was able to differentiate all the degrees of the color wheel.

00:07:38.853 --> 00:07:40.935
But then, I just thought that

00:07:40.935 --> 00:07:44.174
this human vision wasn't good enough.

00:07:44.174 --> 00:07:46.385
There's many, many more colors around us

00:07:46.385 --> 00:07:48.222
that we cannot perceive,

00:07:48.222 --> 00:07:49.978
but that electronic eyes can perceive.

00:07:49.978 --> 00:07:53.707
So I decided to continue extending my color senses,

00:07:53.707 --> 00:07:57.957
and I added infrared and I added ultraviolet

00:07:57.957 --> 00:08:01.315
to the color-to-sound scale, so now I can hear colors

00:08:01.315 --> 00:08:03.539
that the human eye cannot perceive.

00:08:03.539 --> 00:08:06.986
For example, perceiving infrared is good because you can

00:08:06.986 --> 00:08:11.054
actually detect if there's movement detectors in a room.

00:08:11.054 --> 00:08:14.507
I can hear if someone points at me with a remote control.

00:08:14.507 --> 00:08:17.657
And the good thing about perceiving ultraviolet is that

00:08:17.657 --> 00:08:22.622
you can hear if it's a good day or a bad day to sunbathe,

00:08:22.622 --> 00:08:24.779
because ultraviolet is a dangerous color,

00:08:24.779 --> 00:08:28.763
a color that can actually kill us, so I think we should all have this wish

00:08:28.763 --> 00:08:31.724
to perceive things that we cannot perceive.

00:08:31.724 --> 00:08:33.459
That's why, two years ago,

00:08:33.459 --> 00:08:35.140
I created the Cyborg Foundation,

00:08:35.140 --> 00:08:37.582
which is a foundation that tries to help people

00:08:37.582 --> 00:08:40.279
become a cyborg, tries to encourage people

00:08:40.279 --> 00:08:41.656
to extend their senses

00:08:41.656 --> 00:08:44.727
by using technology as part of the body.

00:08:44.727 --> 00:08:48.630
We should all think that knowledge comes from our senses,

00:08:48.630 --> 00:08:50.606
so if we extend our senses,

00:08:50.606 --> 00:08:53.694
we will consequently extend our knowledge.

00:08:53.694 --> 00:08:56.487
I think life will be much more exciting

00:08:56.487 --> 00:08:59.711
when we stop creating applications for mobile phones

00:08:59.711 --> 00:09:03.112
and we start creating applications for our own body.

00:09:03.112 --> 00:09:04.928
I think this will be a big, big change

00:09:04.928 --> 00:09:07.006
that we will see during this century.

00:09:07.006 --> 00:09:10.921
So I do encourage you all to think about which senses

00:09:10.921 --> 00:09:12.340
you'd like to extend.

00:09:12.340 --> 00:09:15.513
I would encourage you to become a cyborg.

00:09:15.513 --> 00:09:20.161
You won't be alone. Thank you. (Applause)

00:09:20.161 --> 00:09:26.681
(Applause)
