Chris Anderson: William, hi. Good to see you.

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:19.150
William Kamkwamba: Thanks.

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:24.150
CA: So, we've got a picture, I think? Where is this?

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:28.150
WK: This is my home. This is where I live.

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:30.150
CA: Where? What country?

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:33.150
WK: In Malawi, Kasungu. In Kasungu. Yeah, Mala.

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:36.150
CA: OK. Now, you're 19 now?

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:38.150
WK: Yeah. I'm 19 years now.

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:41.150
CA: Five years ago you had an idea. What was that?

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:43.150
WK: I wanted to make a windmill.

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:44.150
CA: A windmill?

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:45.150
WK: Yeah.

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:49.150
CA: What, to power -- for lighting and stuff?

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:51.150
WK: Yeah.

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:54.150
CA: So what did you do? How did you realize that?

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:58.150
WK: After I dropped out of school, I went to library,

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:02.150
and I read a book that would -- "Using Energy,"

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:05.150
and I get information about doing the mill.

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:07.150
And I tried, and I made it.

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:17.150
(Applause)

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:21.150
CA: So you copied -- you exactly copied the design in the book.

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.150
WK: Ah, no. I just --

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:25.150
CA: What happened?

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:29.150
WK: In fact, a design of the windmill that was in the book,

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:33.150
it has got four -- ah -- three blades,

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:36.150
and mine has got four blades.

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.150
CA: The book had three, yours had four.

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:39.150
WK: Yeah.

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.150
CA: And you made it out of what?

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:46.150
WK: I made four blades, just because I want to increase power.

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:47.150
CA: OK.

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:48.150
WK: Yeah.

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:50.150
CA: You tested three, and found that four worked better?

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:52.150
WK: Yeah. I test.

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:55.150
CA: And what did you make the windmill out of?

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:57.150
What materials did you use?

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:03.150
WK: I use a bicycle frame, and a pulley, and plastic pipe, what then pulls --

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:06.150
CA: Do we have a picture of that? Can we have the next slide?

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:08.150
WK: Yeah. The windmill.

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:12.150
CA: And so, and that windmill, what -- it worked?

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:17.150
WK: When the wind blows, it rotates and generates.

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:18.150
CA: How much electricity?

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:20.150
WK: 12 watts.

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:25.150
CA: And so, that lit a light for the house? How many lights?

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:27.150
WK: Four bulbs and two radios.

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:28.150
CA: Wow.

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:29.150
WK: Yeah.

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:39.150
(Applause) CA: Next slide --

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:41.150
so who's that?

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:44.150
WK: This is my parents, holding the radio.

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:48.150
CA: So what did they make of -- that you were 14, 15 at the time --

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:51.150
what did they make of this? They were impressed?

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:52.150
WK: Yeah.

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:54.150
CA: And so what's your -- what are you going to do with this?

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:56.150
WK: Um --

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:00.150
CA: What do you -- I mean -- do you want to build another one?

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:03.150
WK: Yeah, I want to build another one --

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:08.150
to pump water and irrigation for crops.

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:10.150
CA: So this one would have to be bigger?

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:11.150
WK: Yeah.

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:12.150
CA: How big?

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:17.150
WK: I think it will produce more than 20 the watts.

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:22.150
CA: So that would produce irrigation for the entire village?

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:24.150
WK: Yeah.

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:27.150
CA: Wow. And so you're talking to people here at TED

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:31.150
to get people who might be able to help in some way

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:33.150
to realize this dream?

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:37.150
WK: Yeah, if they can help me with materials, yeah.

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:40.150
CA: And as you think of your life going forward,

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:43.150
you're 19 now,

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:47.150
do you picture continuing with this dream of working in energy?

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:52.150
WK: Yeah. I'm still thinking to work on energy.

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:56.150
CA: Wow. William, it's a real honor to have you at the TED conference.

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:58.150
Thank you so much for coming.

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:00.150
WK: Thank you.

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:05.150
(Applause)
