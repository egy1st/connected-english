00:00:12.944 --> 00:00:15.360
Hi. So I'd like to talk a little bit about the people

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:17.889
who make the things we use every day:

00:00:17.889 --> 00:00:21.649
our shoes, our handbags, our computers and cell phones.

00:00:21.649 --> 00:00:26.095
Now, this is a conversation that often calls up a lot of guilt.

00:00:26.095 --> 00:00:29.686
Imagine the teenage farm girl who makes less than

00:00:29.686 --> 00:00:32.542
a dollar an hour stitching your running shoes,

00:00:32.542 --> 00:00:35.240
or the young Chinese man who jumps off a rooftop

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:39.280
after working overtime assembling your iPad.

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:42.888
We, the beneficiaries of globalization, seem to exploit

00:00:42.888 --> 00:00:45.591
these victims with every purchase we make,

00:00:45.591 --> 00:00:47.224
and the injustice

00:00:47.224 --> 00:00:50.313
feels embedded in the products themselves.

00:00:50.313 --> 00:00:52.873
After all, what's wrong with a world in which a worker

00:00:52.873 --> 00:00:56.649
on an iPhone assembly line can't even afford to buy one?

00:00:56.649 --> 00:00:59.299
It's taken for granted that Chinese factories are oppressive,

00:00:59.299 --> 00:01:02.030
and that it's our desire for cheap goods

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:04.391
that makes them so.

00:01:04.391 --> 00:01:08.206
So, this simple narrative equating Western demand

00:01:08.206 --> 00:01:11.018
and Chinese suffering is appealing,

00:01:11.018 --> 00:01:13.653
especially at a time when many of us already feel guilty

00:01:13.653 --> 00:01:16.231
about our impact on the world,

00:01:16.231 --> 00:01:20.014
but it's also inaccurate and disrespectful.

00:01:20.014 --> 00:01:22.998
We must be peculiarly self-obsessed to imagine that we

00:01:22.998 --> 00:01:26.166
have the power to drive tens of millions of people

00:01:26.166 --> 00:01:28.878
on the other side of the world to migrate and suffer

00:01:28.878 --> 00:01:31.673
in such terrible ways.

00:01:31.673 --> 00:01:34.491
In fact, China makes goods for markets all over the world,

00:01:34.491 --> 00:01:38.079
including its own, thanks to a combination of factors:

00:01:38.079 --> 00:01:41.485
its low costs, its large and educated workforce,

00:01:41.485 --> 00:01:43.951
and a flexible manufacturing system

00:01:43.951 --> 00:01:47.102
that responds quickly to market demands.

00:01:47.102 --> 00:01:50.151
By focusing so much on ourselves and our gadgets,

00:01:50.151 --> 00:01:52.614
we have rendered the individuals on the other end

00:01:52.614 --> 00:01:55.974
into invisibility, as tiny and interchangeable

00:01:55.974 --> 00:01:59.029
as the parts of a mobile phone.

00:01:59.029 --> 00:02:01.694
Chinese workers are not forced into factories

00:02:01.694 --> 00:02:04.173
because of our insatiable desire for iPods.

00:02:04.173 --> 00:02:07.245
They choose to leave their homes in order to earn money,

00:02:07.245 --> 00:02:11.198
to learn new skills, and to see the world.

00:02:11.198 --> 00:02:13.591
In the ongoing debate about globalization, what's

00:02:13.591 --> 00:02:17.022
been missing is the voices of the workers themselves.

00:02:17.022 --> 00:02:19.327
Here are a few.

00:02:19.327 --> 00:02:23.076
Bao Yongxiu: "My mother tells me to come home

00:02:23.076 --> 00:02:26.800
and get married, but if I marry now, before I have fully

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:30.885
developed myself, I can only marry an ordinary worker,

00:02:30.885 --> 00:02:33.388
so I'm not in a rush."

00:02:33.388 --> 00:02:36.430
Chen Ying: "When I went home for the new year,

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:39.686
everyone said I had changed. They asked me,

00:02:39.686 --> 00:02:42.783
what did you do that you have changed so much?

00:02:42.783 --> 00:02:46.061
I told them that I studied and worked hard. If you tell them

00:02:46.061 --> 00:02:49.429
more, they won't understand anyway."

00:02:49.429 --> 00:02:52.814
Wu Chunming: "Even if I make a lot of money,

00:02:52.814 --> 00:02:54.965
it won't satisfy me.

00:02:54.965 --> 00:02:59.334
Just to make money is not enough meaning in life."

00:02:59.334 --> 00:03:04.046
Xiao Jin: "Now, after I get off work, I study English,

00:03:04.046 --> 00:03:05.835
because in the future, our customers won't

00:03:05.835 --> 00:03:09.697
be only Chinese, so we must learn more languages."

00:03:09.697 --> 00:03:12.468
All of these speakers, by the way, are young women,

00:03:12.468 --> 00:03:15.550
18 or 19 years old.

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:18.492
So I spent two years getting to know assembly line workers

00:03:18.492 --> 00:03:22.421
like these in the south China factory city called Dongguan.

00:03:22.421 --> 00:03:24.941
Certain subjects came up over and over:

00:03:24.941 --> 00:03:26.845
how much money they made,

00:03:26.845 --> 00:03:29.224
what kind of husband they hoped to marry,

00:03:29.224 --> 00:03:31.349
whether they should jump to another factory

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:33.549
or stay where they were.

00:03:33.549 --> 00:03:35.742
Other subjects came up almost never, including

00:03:35.742 --> 00:03:39.189
living conditions that to me looked close to prison life:

00:03:39.189 --> 00:03:41.472
10 or 15 workers in one room,

00:03:41.472 --> 00:03:44.831
50 people sharing a single bathroom,

00:03:44.831 --> 00:03:48.165
days and nights ruled by the factory clock.

00:03:48.165 --> 00:03:51.653
Everyone they knew lived in similar circumstances,

00:03:51.653 --> 00:03:54.414
and it was still better than the dormitories and homes

00:03:54.414 --> 00:03:56.982
of rural China.

00:03:56.982 --> 00:03:59.708
The workers rarely spoke about the products they made,

00:03:59.708 --> 00:04:02.052
and they often had great difficulty explaining

00:04:02.052 --> 00:04:04.494
what exactly they did.

00:04:04.494 --> 00:04:06.205
When I asked Lu Qingmin,

00:04:06.205 --> 00:04:08.307
the young woman I got to know best,

00:04:08.307 --> 00:04:10.774
what exactly she did on the factory floor,

00:04:10.774 --> 00:04:13.179
she said something to me in Chinese that sounded like

00:04:13.179 --> 00:04:14.956
"qiu xi."

00:04:14.956 --> 00:04:17.925
Only much later did I realize that she had been saying

00:04:17.925 --> 00:04:21.149
"QC," or quality control.

00:04:21.149 --> 00:04:25.012
She couldn't even tell me what she did on the factory floor.

00:04:25.012 --> 00:04:27.469
All she could do was parrot a garbled abbreviation

00:04:27.469 --> 00:04:31.463
in a language she didn't even understand.

00:04:31.463 --> 00:04:35.085
Karl Marx saw this as the tragedy of capitalism,

00:04:35.085 --> 00:04:39.128
the alienation of the worker from the product of his labor.

00:04:39.128 --> 00:04:42.752
Unlike, say, a traditional maker of shoes or cabinets,

00:04:42.752 --> 00:04:45.999
the worker in an industrial factory has no control,

00:04:45.999 --> 00:04:49.256
no pleasure, and no true satisfaction or understanding

00:04:49.256 --> 00:04:51.447
in her own work.

00:04:51.447 --> 00:04:53.863
But like so many theories that Marx arrived at

00:04:53.863 --> 00:04:56.682
sitting in the reading room of the British Museum,

00:04:56.682 --> 00:04:59.508
he got this one wrong.

00:04:59.508 --> 00:05:01.807
Just because a person spends her time

00:05:01.807 --> 00:05:04.575
making a piece of something does not mean

00:05:04.575 --> 00:05:07.127
that she becomes that, a piece of something.

00:05:07.127 --> 00:05:10.230
What she does with the money she earns,

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:13.735
what she learns in that place, and how it changes her,

00:05:13.735 --> 00:05:16.496
these are the things that matter.

00:05:16.496 --> 00:05:18.796
What a factory makes is never the point, and

00:05:18.796 --> 00:05:22.880
the workers could not care less who buys their products.

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:25.368
Journalistic coverage of Chinese factories,

00:05:25.368 --> 00:05:27.480
on the other hand, plays up this relationship

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:30.309
between the workers and the products they make.

00:05:30.309 --> 00:05:33.398
Many articles calculate: How long would it take

00:05:33.398 --> 00:05:36.242
for this worker to work in order to earn enough money

00:05:36.242 --> 00:05:38.702
to buy what he's making?

00:05:38.702 --> 00:05:41.190
For example, an entry-level-line assembly line worker

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:44.462
in China in an iPhone plant would have to shell out

00:05:44.462 --> 00:05:48.007
two and a half months' wages for an iPhone.

00:05:48.007 --> 00:05:51.344
But how meaningful is this calculation, really?

00:05:51.344 --> 00:05:53.334
For example, I recently wrote an article

00:05:53.334 --> 00:05:54.312
in The New Yorker magazine,

00:05:54.312 --> 00:05:57.551
but I can't afford to buy an ad in it.

00:05:57.551 --> 00:05:59.607
But, who cares? I don't want an ad in The New Yorker,

00:05:59.607 --> 00:06:02.472
and most of these workers don't really want iPhones.

00:06:02.472 --> 00:06:05.232
Their calculations are different.

00:06:05.232 --> 00:06:07.046
How long should I stay in this factory?

00:06:07.046 --> 00:06:09.509
How much money can I save?

00:06:09.509 --> 00:06:12.079
How much will it take to buy an apartment or a car,

00:06:12.079 --> 00:06:16.669
to get married, or to put my child through school?

00:06:16.669 --> 00:06:19.360
The workers I got to know had a curiously abstract

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:23.118
relationship with the product of their labor.

00:06:23.118 --> 00:06:26.260
About a year after I met Lu Qingmin, or Min,

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:28.294
she invited me home to her family village

00:06:28.294 --> 00:06:30.517
for the Chinese New Year.

00:06:30.517 --> 00:06:32.903
On the train home, she gave me a present:

00:06:32.903 --> 00:06:37.294
a Coach brand change purse with brown leather trim.

00:06:37.294 --> 00:06:38.967
I thanked her, assuming it was fake,

00:06:38.967 --> 00:06:42.444
like almost everything else for sale in Dongguan.

00:06:42.444 --> 00:06:46.253
After we got home, Min gave her mother another present:

00:06:46.253 --> 00:06:48.438
a pink Dooney &amp; Bourke handbag,

00:06:48.438 --> 00:06:50.861
and a few nights later, her sister was showing off

00:06:50.861 --> 00:06:54.365
a maroon LeSportsac shoulder bag.

00:06:54.365 --> 00:06:58.165
Slowly it was dawning on me that these handbags

00:06:58.165 --> 00:07:00.182
were made by their factory,

00:07:00.182 --> 00:07:03.348
and every single one of them was authentic.

00:07:03.348 --> 00:07:05.813
Min's sister said to her parents,

00:07:05.813 --> 00:07:09.175
"In America, this bag sells for 320 dollars."

00:07:09.175 --> 00:07:12.214
Her parents, who are both farmers, looked on, speechless.

00:07:12.214 --> 00:07:14.773
"And that's not all -- Coach is coming out with a new line,

00:07:14.773 --> 00:07:19.574
2191," she said. "One bag will sell for 6,000."

00:07:19.574 --> 00:07:23.821
She paused and said, "I don't know if that's 6,000 yuan or

00:07:23.821 --> 00:07:29.468
6,000 American dollars, but anyway, it's 6,000." (Laughter)

00:07:29.468 --> 00:07:32.063
Min's sister's boyfriend, who had traveled home with her

00:07:32.063 --> 00:07:34.180
for the new year, said,

00:07:34.180 --> 00:07:37.013
"It doesn't look like it's worth that much."

00:07:37.013 --> 00:07:39.838
Min's sister turned to him and said, "Some people actually

00:07:39.838 --> 00:07:43.382
understand these things. You don't understand shit."

00:07:43.382 --> 00:07:48.037
(Laughter) (Applause)

00:07:48.037 --> 00:07:52.077
In Min's world, the Coach bags had a curious currency.

00:07:52.077 --> 00:07:54.397
They weren't exactly worthless, but they were nothing

00:07:54.397 --> 00:07:57.107
close to the actual value, because almost no one they knew

00:07:57.107 --> 00:08:01.037
wanted to buy one, or knew how much it was worth.

00:08:01.037 --> 00:08:04.392
Once, when Min's older sister's friend got married,

00:08:04.392 --> 00:08:07.220
she brought a handbag along as a wedding present.

00:08:07.220 --> 00:08:09.388
Another time, after Min had already left

00:08:09.388 --> 00:08:12.530
the handbag factory, her younger sister came to visit,

00:08:12.530 --> 00:08:16.641
bringing two Coach Signature handbags as gifts.

00:08:16.641 --> 00:08:18.716
I looked in the zippered pocket of one,

00:08:18.716 --> 00:08:22.955
and I found a printed card in English, which read,

00:08:22.955 --> 00:08:26.213
"An American classic.

00:08:26.213 --> 00:08:28.723
In 1941, the burnished patina

00:08:28.723 --> 00:08:31.085
of an all-American baseball glove

00:08:31.085 --> 00:08:33.285
inspired the founder of Coach to create

00:08:33.285 --> 00:08:35.694
a new collection of handbags from the same

00:08:35.694 --> 00:08:38.903
luxuriously soft gloved-hand leather.

00:08:38.903 --> 00:08:43.078
Six skilled leatherworkers crafted 12 Signature handbags

00:08:43.078 --> 00:08:47.214
with perfect proportions and a timeless flair.

00:08:47.214 --> 00:08:49.494
They were fresh, functional, and women everywhere

00:08:49.494 --> 00:08:54.830
adored them. A new American classic was born."

00:08:54.830 --> 00:08:57.156
I wonder what Karl Marx would have made of Min

00:08:57.156 --> 00:08:59.064
and her sisters.

00:08:59.064 --> 00:09:01.671
Their relationship with the product of their labor

00:09:01.671 --> 00:09:03.966
was more complicated, surprising and funny

00:09:03.966 --> 00:09:06.224
than he could have imagined.

00:09:06.224 --> 00:09:09.047
And yet, his view of the world persists, and our tendency

00:09:09.047 --> 00:09:11.656
to see the workers as faceless masses,

00:09:11.656 --> 00:09:15.530
to imagine that we can know what they're really thinking.

00:09:15.530 --> 00:09:18.931
The first time I met Min, she had just turned 18

00:09:18.931 --> 00:09:21.586
and quit her first job on the assembly line

00:09:21.586 --> 00:09:23.901
of an electronics factory.

00:09:23.901 --> 00:09:26.547
Over the next two years, I watched as she switched jobs

00:09:26.547 --> 00:09:29.623
five times, eventually landing a lucrative post

00:09:29.623 --> 00:09:33.197
in the purchasing department of a hardware factory.

00:09:33.197 --> 00:09:35.722
Later, she married a fellow migrant worker,

00:09:35.722 --> 00:09:37.864
moved with him to his village,

00:09:37.864 --> 00:09:40.067
gave birth to two daughters,

00:09:40.067 --> 00:09:42.255
and saved enough money to buy a secondhand Buick

00:09:42.255 --> 00:09:46.661
for herself and an apartment for her parents.

00:09:46.661 --> 00:09:49.794
She recently returned to Dongguan on her own

00:09:49.794 --> 00:09:53.410
to take a job in a factory that makes construction cranes,

00:09:53.410 --> 00:09:55.610
temporarily leaving her husband and children

00:09:55.610 --> 00:09:57.593
back in the village.

00:09:57.593 --> 00:10:00.174
In a recent email to me, she explained,

00:10:00.174 --> 00:10:04.220
"A person should have some ambition while she is young

00:10:04.220 --> 00:10:06.882
so that in old age she can look back on her life

00:10:06.882 --> 00:10:11.665
and feel that it was not lived to no purpose."

00:10:11.665 --> 00:10:16.061
Across China, there are 150 million workers like her,

00:10:16.061 --> 00:10:18.814
one third of them women, who have left their villages

00:10:18.814 --> 00:10:22.357
to work in the factories, the hotels, the restaurants

00:10:22.357 --> 00:10:24.962
and the construction sites of the big cities.

00:10:24.962 --> 00:10:28.706
Together, they make up the largest migration in history,

00:10:28.706 --> 00:10:31.706
and it is globalization, this chain that begins

00:10:31.706 --> 00:10:34.225
in a Chinese farming village

00:10:34.225 --> 00:10:38.002
and ends with iPhones in our pockets and Nikes on our feet

00:10:38.002 --> 00:10:40.426
and Coach handbags on our arms

00:10:40.426 --> 00:10:42.715
that has changed the way these millions of people

00:10:42.715 --> 00:10:47.628
work and marry and live and think.

00:10:47.628 --> 00:10:49.577
Very few of them would want to go back

00:10:49.577 --> 00:10:52.134
to the way things used to be.

00:10:52.134 --> 00:10:55.314
When I first went to Dongguan, I worried that

00:10:55.314 --> 00:10:59.689
it would be depressing to spend so much time with workers.

00:10:59.689 --> 00:11:02.460
I also worried that nothing would ever happen to them,

00:11:02.460 --> 00:11:05.089
or that they would have nothing to say to me.

00:11:05.089 --> 00:11:07.739
Instead, I found young women who were smart and funny

00:11:07.739 --> 00:11:10.586
and brave and generous.

00:11:10.586 --> 00:11:12.917
By opening up their lives to me,

00:11:12.917 --> 00:11:15.123
they taught me so much about factories

00:11:15.123 --> 00:11:19.329
and about China and about how to live in the world.

00:11:21.636 --> 00:11:24.348
This is the Coach purse that Min gave me

00:11:24.348 --> 00:11:26.758
on the train home to visit her family.

00:11:26.758 --> 00:11:29.401
I keep it with me to remind me of the ties that tie me

00:11:29.401 --> 00:11:32.125
to the young women I wrote about,

00:11:32.125 --> 00:11:36.395
ties that are not economic but personal in nature,

00:11:36.395 --> 00:11:39.962
measured not in money but in memories.

00:11:39.962 --> 00:11:43.381
This purse is also a reminder that the things that you imagine,

00:11:43.381 --> 00:11:46.923
sitting in your office or in the library,

00:11:46.923 --> 00:11:49.326
are not how you find them when you actually go out

00:11:49.326 --> 00:11:50.833
into the world.

00:11:50.833 --> 00:11:52.821
Thank you. (Applause)

00:11:52.821 --> 00:11:59.493
(Applause)

00:11:59.493 --> 00:12:01.562
Chris Anderson: Thank you, Leslie, that was an insight

00:12:01.562 --> 00:12:04.159
that a lot of us haven't had before.

00:12:04.159 --> 00:12:07.646
But I'm curious. If you had a minute, say,

00:12:07.646 --> 00:12:11.367
with Apple's head of manufacturing,

00:12:11.367 --> 00:12:13.727
what would you say?

00:12:13.727 --> 00:12:14.855
Leslie Chang: One minute?

00:12:14.855 --> 00:12:16.368
CA: One minute. (Laughter)

00:12:16.368 --> 00:12:18.294
LC: You know, what really impressed me about the workers

00:12:18.294 --> 00:12:21.520
is how much they're self-motivated, self-driven,

00:12:21.520 --> 00:12:24.137
resourceful, and the thing that struck me,

00:12:24.137 --> 00:12:27.102
what they want most is education, to learn,

00:12:27.102 --> 00:12:28.649
because most of them come from very poor backgrounds.

00:12:28.649 --> 00:12:31.593
They usually left school when they were in 7th or 8th grade.

00:12:31.593 --> 00:12:33.832
Their parents are often illiterate,

00:12:33.832 --> 00:12:36.472
and then they come to the city, and they, on their own,

00:12:36.472 --> 00:12:38.597
at night, during the weekends, they'll take a computer class,

00:12:38.597 --> 00:12:40.865
they'll take an English class, and learn

00:12:40.865 --> 00:12:42.989
really, really rudimentary things, you know,

00:12:42.989 --> 00:12:44.728
like how to type a document in Word,

00:12:44.728 --> 00:12:47.392
or how to say really simple things in English.

00:12:47.392 --> 00:12:49.520
So, if you really want to help these workers,

00:12:49.520 --> 00:12:52.743
start these small, very focused, very pragmatic classes

00:12:52.743 --> 00:12:55.872
in these schools, and what's going to happen is,

00:12:55.872 --> 00:12:57.291
all your workers are going to move on,

00:12:57.291 --> 00:13:00.698
but hopefully they'll move on into higher jobs within Apple,

00:13:00.698 --> 00:13:03.639
and you can help their social mobility

00:13:03.639 --> 00:13:04.636
and their self-improvement.

00:13:04.636 --> 00:13:06.414
When you talk to workers, that's what they want.

00:13:06.414 --> 00:13:09.088
They do not say, "I want better hot water in the showers.

00:13:09.088 --> 00:13:11.073
I want a nicer room. I want a TV set."

00:13:11.073 --> 00:13:12.696
I mean, it would be nice to have those things,

00:13:12.696 --> 00:13:13.854
but that's not why they're in the city,

00:13:13.854 --> 00:13:15.943
and that's not what they care about.

00:13:15.943 --> 00:13:19.493
CA: Was there a sense from them of a narrative that

00:13:19.493 --> 00:13:22.905
things were kind of tough and bad, or was there a narrative

00:13:22.905 --> 00:13:25.918
of some kind of level of growth, that things over time

00:13:25.918 --> 00:13:27.541
were getting better?

00:13:27.541 --> 00:13:29.448
LC: Oh definitely, definitely. I mean, you know,

00:13:29.448 --> 00:13:31.814
it was interesting, because I spent basically two years

00:13:31.814 --> 00:13:33.808
hanging out in this city, Dongguan,

00:13:33.808 --> 00:13:35.919
and over that time, you could see immense change

00:13:35.919 --> 00:13:38.714
in every person's life: upward, downward, sideways,

00:13:38.714 --> 00:13:40.535
but generally upward.

00:13:40.535 --> 00:13:42.322
If you spend enough time, it's upward, and I met people

00:13:42.322 --> 00:13:44.617
who had moved to the city 10 years ago, and who are now

00:13:44.617 --> 00:13:46.724
basically urban middle class people,

00:13:46.724 --> 00:13:48.745
so the trajectory is definitely upward.

00:13:48.745 --> 00:13:50.680
It's just hard to see when you're suddenly

00:13:50.680 --> 00:13:52.801
sucked into the city. It looks like everyone's poor and

00:13:52.801 --> 00:13:54.539
desperate, but that's not really how it is.

00:13:54.539 --> 00:13:56.693
Certainly, the factory conditions are really tough,

00:13:56.693 --> 00:13:59.010
and it's nothing you or I would want to do,

00:13:59.010 --> 00:14:02.155
but from their perspective, where they're coming from

00:14:02.155 --> 00:14:04.152
is much worse, and where they're going

00:14:04.152 --> 00:14:06.160
is hopefully much better, and I just wanted to give

00:14:06.160 --> 00:14:08.521
that context of what's going on in their minds,

00:14:08.521 --> 00:14:10.884
not what necessarily is going on in yours.

00:14:10.884 --> 00:14:12.380
CA: Thanks so much for your talk.

00:14:12.380 --> 00:14:16.749
Thank you very much. (Applause)
