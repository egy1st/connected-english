00:00:13.637 --> 00:00:15.806
Beau Lotto: So, this game is very simple.

00:00:15.806 --> 00:00:19.853
All you have to do is read what you see. Right?

00:00:19.853 --> 00:00:23.054
So, I'm going to count to you, so we don't all do it together.

00:00:23.054 --> 00:00:25.553
Okay, one, two, three.Audience: Can you read this?

00:00:25.553 --> 00:00:29.932
BL: Amazing. What about this one? One, two, three.Audience: You are not reading this.

00:00:29.932 --> 00:00:35.248
BL: All right. One, two, three. (Laughter)

00:00:35.248 --> 00:00:40.045
If you were Portuguese, right? How about this one? One, two, three.

00:00:40.045 --> 00:00:42.023
Audience: What are you reading?

00:00:42.023 --> 00:00:45.481
BL: What are you reading? There are no words there.

00:00:45.481 --> 00:00:48.018
I said, read what you're seeing. Right?

00:00:48.018 --> 00:00:51.868
It literally says, "Wat ar ou rea in?" (Laughter) Right?

00:00:51.868 --> 00:00:55.696
That's what you should have said. Right? Why is this?

00:00:55.696 --> 00:00:59.232
It's because perception is grounded in our experience.

00:00:59.232 --> 00:01:02.129
Right? The brain takes meaningless information

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:05.088
and makes meaning out of it, which means we never see

00:01:05.088 --> 00:01:07.344
what's there, we never see information,

00:01:07.344 --> 00:01:10.619
we only ever see what was useful to see in the past.

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:13.355
All right? Which means, when it comes to perception,

00:01:13.355 --> 00:01:20.150
we're all like this frog.

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:21.062
(Laughter)

00:01:21.062 --> 00:01:24.457
Right? It's getting information. It's generating behavior

00:01:24.457 --> 00:01:28.925
that's useful. (Laughter)

00:01:28.925 --> 00:01:35.957
(Laughter)

00:01:35.957 --> 00:01:41.939
(Video) Man: Ow! Ow! (Laughter) (Applause)

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:44.651
BL: And sometimes, when things don't go our way,

00:01:44.651 --> 00:01:46.910
we get a little bit annoyed, right?

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:49.640
But we're talking about perception here, right?

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:54.005
And perception underpins everything we think, we know,

00:01:54.005 --> 00:01:56.876
we believe, our hopes, our dreams, the clothes we wear,

00:01:56.876 --> 00:02:00.619
falling in love, everything begins with perception.

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:03.564
Now if perception is grounded in our history, it means

00:02:03.564 --> 00:02:07.023
we're only ever responding according to what we've done before.

00:02:07.023 --> 00:02:10.099
But actually, it's a tremendous problem,

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:13.716
because how can we ever see differently?

00:02:13.716 --> 00:02:17.779
Now, I want to tell you a story about seeing differently,

00:02:17.779 --> 00:02:21.767
and all new perceptions begin in the same way.

00:02:21.767 --> 00:02:24.349
They begin with a question.

00:02:24.349 --> 00:02:27.587
The problem with questions is they create uncertainty.

00:02:27.587 --> 00:02:30.316
Now, uncertainty is a very bad thing. It's evolutionarily

00:02:30.316 --> 00:02:33.917
a bad thing. If you're not sure that's a predator, it's too late.

00:02:33.917 --> 00:02:35.277
Okay? (Laughter)

00:02:35.277 --> 00:02:38.437
Even seasickness is a consequence of uncertainty.

00:02:38.437 --> 00:02:40.689
Right? If you go down below on a boat, your inner ears

00:02:40.689 --> 00:02:42.865
are you telling you you're moving. Your eyes, because

00:02:42.865 --> 00:02:45.181
it's moving in register with the boat, say I'm standing still.

00:02:45.181 --> 00:02:49.836
Your brain cannot deal with the uncertainty of that information, and it gets ill.

00:02:49.836 --> 00:02:53.765
The question "why?" is one of the most dangerous things you can do,

00:02:53.765 --> 00:02:56.757
because it takes you into uncertainty.

00:02:56.757 --> 00:02:59.636
And yet, the irony is, the only way we can ever

00:02:59.636 --> 00:03:03.172
do anything new is to step into that space.

00:03:03.172 --> 00:03:06.396
So how can we ever do anything new? Well fortunately,

00:03:06.396 --> 00:03:09.980
evolution has given us an answer, right?

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:13.575
And it enables us to address even the most difficult

00:03:13.575 --> 00:03:18.254
of questions. The best questions are the ones that create the most uncertainty.

00:03:18.254 --> 00:03:22.210
They're the ones that question the things we think to be true already. Right?

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:24.199
It's easy to ask questions about how did life begin,

00:03:24.199 --> 00:03:27.507
or what extends beyond the universe, but to question what you think to be true already

00:03:27.507 --> 00:03:30.508
is really stepping into that space.

00:03:30.508 --> 00:03:35.318
So what is evolution's answer to the problem of uncertainty?

00:03:35.318 --> 00:03:37.091
It's play.

00:03:37.091 --> 00:03:41.284
Now play is not simply a process. Experts in play will tell you

00:03:41.284 --> 00:03:43.899
that actually it's a way of being.

00:03:43.899 --> 00:03:46.790
Play is one of the only human endeavors where uncertainty

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:51.116
is actually celebrated. Uncertainty is what makes play fun.

00:03:51.116 --> 00:03:55.391
Right? It's adaptable to change. Right? It opens possibility,

00:03:55.391 --> 00:03:59.500
and it's cooperative. It's actually how we do our social bonding,

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:01.226
and it's intrinsically motivated. What that means

00:04:01.226 --> 00:04:05.832
is that we play to play. Play is its own reward.

00:04:05.832 --> 00:04:09.723
Now if you look at these five ways of being,

00:04:09.723 --> 00:04:12.444
these are the exact same ways of being you need

00:04:12.444 --> 00:04:14.480
in order to be a good scientist.

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:17.507
Science is not defined by the method section of a paper.

00:04:17.507 --> 00:04:20.647
It's actually a way of being, which is here, and this is true

00:04:20.647 --> 00:04:23.300
for anything that is creative.

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:27.503
So if you add rules to play, you have a game.

00:04:27.503 --> 00:04:30.293
That's actually what an experiment is.

00:04:30.293 --> 00:04:32.212
So armed with these two ideas,

00:04:32.212 --> 00:04:36.534
that science is a way of being and experiments are play,

00:04:36.534 --> 00:04:39.987
we asked, can anyone become a scientist?

00:04:39.987 --> 00:04:43.487
And who better to ask than 25 eight- to 10-year-old children?

00:04:43.487 --> 00:04:46.994
Because they're experts in play. So I took my bee arena

00:04:46.994 --> 00:04:50.541
down to a small school in Devon, and the aim of this

00:04:50.541 --> 00:04:54.785
was to not just get the kids to see science differently,

00:04:54.785 --> 00:04:59.383
but, through the process of science, to see themselves differently. Right?

00:04:59.383 --> 00:05:02.791
The first step was to ask a question.

00:05:02.791 --> 00:05:05.671
Now, I should say that we didn't get funding for this study

00:05:05.671 --> 00:05:09.001
because the scientists said small children couldn't make

00:05:09.001 --> 00:05:13.303
a useful contribution to science, and the teachers said kids couldn't do it.

00:05:13.303 --> 00:05:17.037
So we did it anyway. Right? Of course.

00:05:17.037 --> 00:05:19.856
So, here are some of the questions. I put them in small print

00:05:19.856 --> 00:05:24.296
so you wouldn't bother reading it. Point is that five of the questions that the kids came up with

00:05:24.296 --> 00:05:28.914
were actually the basis of science publication the last five to 15 years. Right?

00:05:28.914 --> 00:05:31.574
So they were asking questions that were significant

00:05:31.574 --> 00:05:33.704
to expert scientists.

00:05:33.704 --> 00:05:37.838
Now here, I want to share the stage with someone quite special. Right?

00:05:37.838 --> 00:05:40.450
She was one of the young people who was involved in this study,

00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:42.784
and she's now one of the youngest published scientists

00:05:42.784 --> 00:05:46.667
in the world. Right? She will now, once she comes onto stage,

00:05:46.667 --> 00:05:50.365
will be the youngest person to ever speak at TED. Right?

00:05:50.365 --> 00:05:53.240
Now, science and asking questions is about courage.

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:56.440
Now she is the personification of courage, because she's

00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:57.827
going to stand up here and talk to you all.

00:05:57.827 --> 00:06:03.081
So Amy, would you please come up? (Applause)

00:06:03.081 --> 00:06:10.266
(Applause)

00:06:10.266 --> 00:06:12.785
So Amy's going to help me tell the story of what we call

00:06:12.785 --> 00:06:15.451
the Blackawton Bees Project, and first she's going to tell you

00:06:15.451 --> 00:06:17.996
the question that they came up with. So go ahead, Amy.

00:06:17.996 --> 00:06:19.715
Amy O'Toole: Thank you, Beau. We thought

00:06:19.715 --> 00:06:23.116
that it was easy to see the link between humans and apes

00:06:23.116 --> 00:06:26.140
in the way that we think, because we look alike.

00:06:26.140 --> 00:06:28.829
But we wondered if there's a possible link

00:06:28.829 --> 00:06:33.533
with other animals. It'd be amazing if humans and bees

00:06:33.533 --> 00:06:37.646
thought similar, since they seem so different from us.

00:06:37.646 --> 00:06:40.699
So we asked if humans and bees might solve

00:06:40.699 --> 00:06:43.106
complex problems in the same way.

00:06:43.106 --> 00:06:46.393
Really, we wanted to know if bees can also adapt

00:06:46.393 --> 00:06:50.100
themselves to new situations using previously learned rules

00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:54.314
and conditions. So what if bees can think like us?

00:06:54.314 --> 00:06:56.866
Well, it'd be amazing, since we're talking about an insect

00:06:56.866 --> 00:06:59.391
with only one million brain cells.

00:06:59.391 --> 00:07:01.533
But it actually makes a lot of sense they should,

00:07:01.533 --> 00:07:04.810
because bees, like us, can recognize a good flower

00:07:04.810 --> 00:07:08.423
regardless of the time of day, the light, the weather,

00:07:08.423 --> 00:07:14.165
or from any angle they approach it from. (Applause)

00:07:14.165 --> 00:07:17.947
BL: So the next step was to design an experiment,

00:07:17.947 --> 00:07:21.249
which is a game. So the kids went off and they designed

00:07:21.249 --> 00:07:24.550
this experiment, and so -- well, game -- and so,

00:07:24.550 --> 00:07:26.016
Amy, can you tell us what the game was,

00:07:26.016 --> 00:07:28.159
and the puzzle that you set the bees?

00:07:28.159 --> 00:07:31.182
AO: The puzzle we came up with was an if-then rule.

00:07:31.182 --> 00:07:34.827
We asked the bees to learn not just to go to a certain color,

00:07:34.827 --> 00:07:37.495
but to a certain color flower only

00:07:37.495 --> 00:07:39.127
when it's in a certain pattern.

00:07:39.127 --> 00:07:42.386
They were only rewarded if they went to the yellow flowers

00:07:42.386 --> 00:07:45.446
if the yellow flowers were surrounded by the blue,

00:07:45.446 --> 00:07:48.714
or if the blue flowers were surrounded by the yellow.

00:07:48.714 --> 00:07:51.299
Now there's a number of different rules the bees can learn

00:07:51.299 --> 00:07:54.724
to solve this puzzle. The interesting question is, which?

00:07:54.724 --> 00:07:57.504
What was really exciting about this project was we,

00:07:57.504 --> 00:07:59.847
and Beau, had no idea whether it would work.

00:07:59.847 --> 00:08:02.301
It was completely new, and no one had done it before,

00:08:02.301 --> 00:08:06.024
including adults. (Laughter)

00:08:06.024 --> 00:08:09.488
BL: Including the teachers, and that was really hard for the teachers.

00:08:09.488 --> 00:08:12.392
It's easy for a scientist to go in and not have a clue what he's doing,

00:08:12.392 --> 00:08:14.936
because that's what we do in the lab, but for a teacher

00:08:14.936 --> 00:08:16.561
not to know what's going to happen at the end of the day --

00:08:16.561 --> 00:08:19.160
so much of the credit goes to Dave Strudwick, who was

00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:21.369
the collaborator on this project. Okay?

00:08:21.369 --> 00:08:24.101
So I'm not going to go through the whole details of the study

00:08:24.101 --> 00:08:26.739
because actually you can read about it, but the next step

00:08:26.739 --> 00:08:30.384
is observation. So here are some of the students

00:08:30.384 --> 00:08:33.152
doing the observations. They're recording the data

00:08:33.152 --> 00:08:38.196
of where the bees fly.

00:08:38.196 --> 00:08:40.219
(Video) Dave Strudwick: So what we're going to do —Student: 5C.

00:08:40.219 --> 00:08:44.209
Dave Strudwick: Is she still going up here?Student: Yeah.

00:08:44.209 --> 00:08:47.806
Dave Strudwick: So you keep track of each.Student: Henry, can you help me here?

00:08:47.806 --> 00:08:50.710
BL: "Can you help me, Henry?" What good scientist says that, right?

00:08:50.710 --> 00:08:55.420
Student: There's two up there.

00:08:55.420 --> 00:08:58.294
And three in here.

00:08:58.294 --> 00:09:00.569
BL: Right? So we've got our observations. We've got our data.

00:09:00.569 --> 00:09:04.342
They do the simple mathematics, averaging, etc., etc.

00:09:04.342 --> 00:09:06.273
And now we want to share. That's the next step.

00:09:06.273 --> 00:09:07.881
So we're going to write this up and try to submit this

00:09:07.881 --> 00:09:10.737
for publication. Right? So we have to write it up.

00:09:10.737 --> 00:09:15.250
So we go, of course, to the pub. All right? (Laughter)

00:09:15.250 --> 00:09:17.534
The one on the left is mine, okay? (Laughter)

00:09:17.534 --> 00:09:19.620
Now, I tell them, a paper has four different sections:

00:09:19.620 --> 00:09:22.427
an introduction, a methods, a results, a discussion.

00:09:22.427 --> 00:09:25.031
The introduction says, what's the question and why?

00:09:25.031 --> 00:09:28.150
Methods, what did you do? Results, what was the observation?

00:09:28.150 --> 00:09:30.293
And the discussion is, who cares? Right?

00:09:30.293 --> 00:09:32.752
That's a science paper, basically. (Laughter)

00:09:32.752 --> 00:09:37.281
So the kids give me the words, right? I put it into a narrative,

00:09:37.281 --> 00:09:40.528
which means that this paper is written in kidspeak.

00:09:40.528 --> 00:09:43.056
It's not written by me. It's written by Amy

00:09:43.056 --> 00:09:46.376
and the other students in the class. As a consequence,

00:09:46.376 --> 00:09:52.393
this science paper begins, "Once upon a time ... " (Laughter)

00:09:52.393 --> 00:09:57.705
The results section, it says: "Training phase, the puzzle ... duh duh duuuuuhhh." Right? (Laughter)

00:09:57.705 --> 00:09:59.901
And the methods, it says, "Then we put the bees

00:09:59.901 --> 00:10:03.218
into the fridge (and made bee pie)," smiley face. Right? (Laughter)

00:10:03.218 --> 00:10:07.051
This is a science paper. We're going to try to get it published.

00:10:07.051 --> 00:10:09.885
So here's the title page. We have a number of authors there.

00:10:09.885 --> 00:10:12.736
All the ones in bold are eight to 10 years old.

00:10:12.736 --> 00:10:14.786
The first author is Blackawton Primary School, because

00:10:14.786 --> 00:10:18.032
if it were ever referenced, it would be "Blackawton et al,"

00:10:18.032 --> 00:10:21.089
and not one individual. So we submit it to a public access journal,

00:10:21.089 --> 00:10:24.421
and it says this. It said many things, but it said this.

00:10:24.421 --> 00:10:28.340
"I'm afraid the paper fails our initial quality control checks in several different ways." (Laughter)

00:10:28.340 --> 00:10:30.900
In other words, it starts off "once upon a time,"

00:10:30.900 --> 00:10:33.426
the figures are in crayon, etc. (Laughter)

00:10:33.426 --> 00:10:37.779
So we said, we'll get it reviewed. So I sent it to Dale Purves,

00:10:37.779 --> 00:10:41.312
who is at the National Academy of Science, one of the leading neuroscientists in the world,

00:10:41.312 --> 00:10:44.761
and he says, "This is the most original science paper I have ever read" — (Laughter) —

00:10:44.761 --> 00:10:46.858
"and it certainly deserves wide exposure."

00:10:46.858 --> 00:10:51.129
Larry Maloney, expert in vision, says, "The paper is magnificent.

00:10:51.129 --> 00:10:54.495
The work would be publishable if done by adults."

00:10:54.495 --> 00:10:56.474
So what did we do? We send it back to the editor.

00:10:56.474 --> 00:10:58.063
They say no.

00:10:58.063 --> 00:11:00.517
So we asked Larry and Natalie Hempel to write

00:11:00.517 --> 00:11:04.524
a commentary situating the findings for scientists, right,

00:11:04.524 --> 00:11:08.652
putting in the references, and we submit it to Biology Letters.

00:11:08.652 --> 00:11:11.979
And there, it was reviewed by five independent referees,

00:11:11.979 --> 00:11:16.400
and it was published. Okay? (Applause)

00:11:16.400 --> 00:11:22.400
(Applause)

00:11:22.400 --> 00:11:25.421
It took four months to do the science,

00:11:25.421 --> 00:11:28.649
two years to get it published. (Laughter)

00:11:28.649 --> 00:11:33.484
Typical science, actually, right? So this makes Amy and

00:11:33.484 --> 00:11:35.917
her friends the youngest published scientists in the world.

00:11:35.917 --> 00:11:37.933
What was the feedback like?

00:11:37.933 --> 00:11:40.818
Well, it was published two days before Christmas,

00:11:40.818 --> 00:11:44.821
downloaded 30,000 times in the first day, right?

00:11:44.821 --> 00:11:48.861
It was the Editors' Choice in Science, which is a top science magazine.

00:11:48.861 --> 00:11:51.403
It's forever freely accessible by Biology Letters.

00:11:51.403 --> 00:11:55.083
It's the only paper that will ever be freely accessible by this journal.

00:11:55.083 --> 00:11:57.782
Last year, it was the second-most downloaded paper

00:11:57.782 --> 00:12:01.886
by Biology Letters, and the feedback from not just scientists

00:12:01.886 --> 00:12:04.434
and teachers but the public as well.

00:12:04.434 --> 00:12:06.206
And I'll just read one.

00:12:06.206 --> 00:12:08.696
"I have read 'Blackawton Bees' recently. I don't have

00:12:08.696 --> 00:12:11.009
words to explain exactly how I am feeling right now.

00:12:11.009 --> 00:12:13.488
What you guys have done is real, true and amazing.

00:12:13.488 --> 00:12:16.597
Curiosity, interest, innocence and zeal are the most basic

00:12:16.597 --> 00:12:18.321
and most important things to do science.

00:12:18.321 --> 00:12:20.799
Who else can have these qualities more than children?

00:12:20.799 --> 00:12:24.340
Please congratulate your children's team from my side."

00:12:24.340 --> 00:12:27.723
So I'd like to conclude with a physical metaphor.

00:12:27.723 --> 00:12:30.691
Can I do it on you? (Laughter)

00:12:30.691 --> 00:12:33.784
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, come on. Yeah yeah. Okay.

00:12:33.784 --> 00:12:38.961
Now, science is about taking risks, so this is an incredible risk, right? (Laughter)

00:12:38.961 --> 00:12:45.059
For me, not for him. Right? Because we've only done this once before. (Laughter)

00:12:45.059 --> 00:12:46.635
And you like technology, right?

00:12:46.635 --> 00:12:48.811
Shimon Schocken: Right, but I like myself.

00:12:48.811 --> 00:12:51.762
BL: This is the epitome of technology. Right. Okay.

00:12:51.762 --> 00:12:55.370
Now ... (Laughter)

00:12:55.370 --> 00:12:58.250
Okay. (Laughter)

00:12:58.250 --> 00:13:02.334
Now, we're going to do a little demonstration, right?

00:13:02.334 --> 00:13:06.353
You have to close your eyes, and you have to point

00:13:06.353 --> 00:13:09.510
where you hear me clapping. All right?

00:13:09.510 --> 00:13:13.908
(Clapping)

00:13:13.908 --> 00:13:17.052
(Clapping)

00:13:17.052 --> 00:13:19.955
Okay, how about if everyone over there shouts. One, two, three?

00:13:19.955 --> 00:13:22.856
Audience: (Shouts)

00:13:22.856 --> 00:13:27.302
(Laughter)

00:13:27.302 --> 00:13:30.473
(Shouts) (Laughter)

00:13:30.473 --> 00:13:34.114
Brilliant. Now, open your eyes. We'll do it one more time.

00:13:34.114 --> 00:13:36.916
Everyone over there shout. (Shouts)

00:13:36.916 --> 00:13:42.848
Where's the sound coming from? (Laughter) (Applause)

00:13:42.848 --> 00:13:47.078
Thank you very much. (Applause)

00:13:47.078 --> 00:13:50.791
What's the point? The point is what science does for us.

00:13:50.791 --> 00:13:53.197
Right? We normally walk through life responding,

00:13:53.197 --> 00:13:55.409
but if we ever want to do anything different, we have to

00:13:55.409 --> 00:13:58.098
step into uncertainty. When he opened his eyes,

00:13:58.098 --> 00:14:00.480
he was able to see the world in a new way.

00:14:00.480 --> 00:14:03.648
That's what science offers us. It offers the possibility

00:14:03.648 --> 00:14:07.664
to step on uncertainty through the process of play, right?

00:14:07.664 --> 00:14:10.688
Now, true science education I think should be about

00:14:10.688 --> 00:14:14.087
giving people a voice and enabling to express that voice,

00:14:14.087 --> 00:14:18.456
so I've asked Amy to be the last voice in this short story.

00:14:18.456 --> 00:14:21.561
So, Amy?

00:14:21.561 --> 00:14:24.114
AO: This project was really exciting for me,

00:14:24.114 --> 00:14:26.785
because it brought the process of discovery to life,

00:14:26.785 --> 00:14:29.696
and it showed me that anyone, and I mean anyone,

00:14:29.696 --> 00:14:32.449
has the potential to discover something new,

00:14:32.449 --> 00:14:36.521
and that a small question can lead into a big discovery.

00:14:36.521 --> 00:14:39.173
Changing the way a person thinks about something

00:14:39.173 --> 00:14:42.885
can be easy or hard. It all depends on the way the person

00:14:42.885 --> 00:14:44.373
feels about change.

00:14:44.373 --> 00:14:46.825
But changing the way I thought about science was

00:14:46.825 --> 00:14:49.100
surprisingly easy. Once we played the games

00:14:49.100 --> 00:14:51.518
and then started to think about the puzzle,

00:14:51.518 --> 00:14:55.375
I then realized that science isn't just a boring subject,

00:14:55.375 --> 00:14:58.569
and that anyone can discover something new.

00:14:58.569 --> 00:15:01.769
You just need an opportunity. My opportunity came

00:15:01.769 --> 00:15:04.405
in the form of Beau, and the Blackawton Bee Project.

00:15:04.405 --> 00:15:08.766
Thank you.BL: Thank you very much. (Applause)

00:15:08.766 --> 00:15:16.513
(Applause)
