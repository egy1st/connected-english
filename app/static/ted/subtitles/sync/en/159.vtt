WEBVTT

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:17.150
I am very, very happy to be amidst some of the most --

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:19.150
the lights are really disturbing my eyes

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:21.150
and they're reflecting on my glasses.

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:25.150
I am very happy and honored to be amidst

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:28.150
very, very innovative and intelligent people.

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:31.150
I have listened to the three previous speakers,

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:33.150
and guess what happened?

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:36.150
Every single thing I planned to say, they have said it here,

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:41.150
and it looks and sounds like I have nothing else to say.

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:42.150
(Laughter)

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:45.150
But there is a saying in my culture

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:50.150
that if a bud leaves a tree without saying something,

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:53.150
that bud is a young one.

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:58.150
So, I will -- since I am not young and am very old,

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:00.150
I still will say something.

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:05.150
We are hosting this conference at a very opportune moment,

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:07.150
because another conference is taking place in Berlin.

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:10.150
It is the G8 Summit.

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:17.150
The G8 Summit proposes that the solution to Africa's problems

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:20.150
should be a massive increase in aid,

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:22.150
something akin to the Marshall Plan.

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:26.150
Unfortunately, I personally do not believe in the Marshall Plan.

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:31.150
One, because the benefits of the Marshall Plan have been overstated.

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:34.150
Its largest recipients were Germany and France,

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:37.150
and it was only 2.5 percent of their GDP.

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:40.150
An average African country receives foreign aid

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:46.150
to the tune of 13, 15 percent of its GDP,

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:49.150
and that is an unprecedented transfer of financial resources

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:52.150
from rich countries to poor countries.

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:55.150
But I want to say that there are two things we need to connect.

00:01:55.150 --> 00:02:01.150
How the media covers Africa in the West, and the consequences of that.

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:04.150
By displaying despair, helplessness and hopelessness,

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:10.150
the media is telling the truth about Africa, and nothing but the truth.

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:14.150
However, the media is not telling us the whole truth.

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:18.150
Because despair, civil war, hunger and famine,

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:22.150
although they're part and parcel of our African reality,

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:24.150
they are not the only reality.

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:26.150
And secondly, they are the smallest reality.

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:28.150
Africa has 53 nations.

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:31.150
We have civil wars only in six countries,

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:35.150
which means that the media are covering only six countries.

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:39.150
Africa has immense opportunities that never navigate

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:41.150
through the web of despair and helplessness

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:46.150
that the Western media largely presents to its audience.

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:50.150
But the effect of that presentation is, it appeals to sympathy.

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:55.150
It appeals to pity. It appeals to something called charity.

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:58.150
And, as a consequence, the Western view

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:03.150
of Africa's economic dilemma is framed wrongly.

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:07.150
The wrong framing is a product of thinking

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:10.150
that Africa is a place of despair.

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:13.150
What should we do with it? We should give food to the hungry.

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:16.150
We should deliver medicines to those who are ill.

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:18.150
We should send peacekeeping troops

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:20.150
to serve those who are facing a civil war.

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:25.150
And in the process, Africa has been stripped of self-initiative.

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:28.150
I want to say that it is important to recognize

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:31.150
that Africa has fundamental weaknesses.

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:35.150
But equally, it has opportunities and a lot of potential.

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:39.150
We need to reframe the challenge that is facing Africa,

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:41.150
from a challenge of despair,

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:45.150
which is called poverty reduction,

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:47.150
to a challenge of hope.

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:51.150
We frame it as a challenge of hope, and that is worth creation.

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:54.150
The challenge facing all those who are interested in Africa

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:56.150
is not the challenge of reducing poverty.

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:59.150
It should be a challenge of creating wealth.

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:02.150
Once we change those two things --

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:07.150
if you say the Africans are poor and they need poverty reduction,

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:11.150
you have the international cartel of good intentions

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:14.150
moving onto the continent, with what?

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:17.150
Medicines for the poor, food relief for those who are hungry,

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:22.150
and peacekeepers for those who are facing civil war.

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:26.150
And in the process, none of these things really are productive

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:28.150
because you are treating the symptoms, not the causes

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:31.150
of Africa's fundamental problems.

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:34.150
Sending somebody to school and giving them medicines,

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:39.150
ladies and gentlemen, does not create wealth for them.

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:43.150
Wealth is a function of income, and income comes from you finding

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:47.150
a profitable trading opportunity or a well-paying job.

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:50.150
Now, once we begin to talk about wealth creation in Africa,

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:52.150
our second challenge will be,

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:55.150
who are the wealth-creating agents in any society?

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:59.150
They are entrepreneurs. [Unclear] told us they are always

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:03.150
about four percent of the population, but 16 percent are imitators.

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:08.150
But they also succeed at the job of entrepreneurship.

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:11.150
So, where should we be putting the money?

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:16.150
We need to put money where it can productively grow.

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:20.150
Support private investment in Africa, both domestic and foreign.

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:23.150
Support research institutions,

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:27.150
because knowledge is an important part of wealth creation.

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:31.150
But what is the international aid community doing with Africa today?

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:34.150
They are throwing large sums of money for primary health,

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:37.150
for primary education, for food relief.

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:39.150
The entire continent has been turned into

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:42.150
a place of despair, in need of charity.

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:44.150
Ladies and gentlemen, can any one of you tell me

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:47.150
a neighbor, a friend, a relative that you know,

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:51.150
who became rich by receiving charity?

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:54.150
By holding the begging bowl and receiving alms?

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:57.150
Does any one of you in the audience have that person?

00:05:57.150 --> 00:06:02.150
Does any one of you know a country that developed because of

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:05.150
the generosity and kindness of another?

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:07.150
Well, since I'm not seeing the hand,

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:10.150
it appears that what I'm stating is true.

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:12.150
(Bono: Yes!)

00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:14.150
Andrew Mwenda: I can see Bono says he knows the country.

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:15.150
Which country is that?

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:16.150
(Bono: It's an Irish land.)

00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:18.150
(Laughter)

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:20.150
(Bono: [unclear])

00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:24.150
AM: Thank you very much. But let me tell you this.

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:28.150
External actors can only present to you an opportunity.

00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:33.150
The ability to utilize that opportunity and turn it into an advantage

00:06:33.150 --> 00:06:35.150
depends on your internal capacity.

00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:37.150
Africa has received many opportunities.

00:06:37.150 --> 00:06:40.150
Many of them we haven't benefited much.

00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:45.150
Why? Because we lack the internal, institutional framework

00:06:45.150 --> 00:06:48.150
and policy framework that can make it possible for us

00:06:48.150 --> 00:06:51.150
to benefit from our external relations. I'll give you an example.

00:06:51.150 --> 00:06:53.150
Under the Cotonou Agreement,

00:06:53.150 --> 00:06:56.150
formerly known as the Lome Convention,

00:06:56.150 --> 00:06:59.150
African countries have been given an opportunity by Europe

00:06:59.150 --> 00:07:04.150
to export goods, duty-free, to the European Union market.

00:07:04.150 --> 00:07:10.150
My own country, Uganda, has a quota to export 50,000 metric tons

00:07:10.150 --> 00:07:13.150
of sugar to the European Union market.

00:07:13.150 --> 00:07:15.150
We haven't exported one kilogram yet.

00:07:15.150 --> 00:07:24.150
We import 50,000 metric tons of sugar from Brazil and Cuba.

00:07:24.150 --> 00:07:27.150
Secondly, under the beef protocol of that agreement,

00:07:27.150 --> 00:07:29.150
African countries that produce beef

00:07:29.150 --> 00:07:34.150
have quotas to export beef duty-free to the European Union market.

00:07:34.150 --> 00:07:38.150
None of those countries, including Africa's most successful nation, Botswana,

00:07:38.150 --> 00:07:41.150
has ever met its quota.

00:07:41.150 --> 00:07:46.150
So, I want to argue today that the fundamental source of Africa's

00:07:46.150 --> 00:07:48.150
inability to engage the rest of the world

00:07:48.150 --> 00:07:51.150
in a more productive relationship

00:07:51.150 --> 00:07:55.150
is because it has a poor institutional and policy framework.

00:07:55.150 --> 00:07:58.150
And all forms of intervention need support,

00:07:58.150 --> 00:08:02.150
the evolution of the kinds of institutions that create wealth,

00:08:02.150 --> 00:08:05.150
the kinds of institutions that increase productivity.

00:08:05.150 --> 00:08:09.150
How do we begin to do that, and why is aid the bad instrument?

00:08:09.150 --> 00:08:11.150
Aid is the bad instrument, and do you know why?

00:08:11.150 --> 00:08:15.150
Because all governments across the world need money to survive.

00:08:15.150 --> 00:08:19.150
Money is needed for a simple thing like keeping law and order.

00:08:19.150 --> 00:08:21.150
You have to pay the army and the police to show law and order.

00:08:21.150 --> 00:08:25.150
And because many of our governments are quite dictatorial,

00:08:25.150 --> 00:08:29.150
they need really to have the army clobber the opposition.

00:08:29.150 --> 00:08:34.150
The second thing you need to do is pay your political hangers-on.

00:08:34.150 --> 00:08:35.150
Why should people support their government?

00:08:35.150 --> 00:08:37.150
Well, because it gives them good, paying jobs,

00:08:37.150 --> 00:08:41.150
or, in many African countries, unofficial opportunities

00:08:41.150 --> 00:08:43.150
to profit from corruption.

00:08:43.150 --> 00:08:46.150
The fact is no government in the world,

00:08:46.150 --> 00:08:48.150
with the exception of a few, like that of Idi Amin,

00:08:48.150 --> 00:08:53.150
can seek to depend entirely on force as an instrument of rule.

00:08:53.150 --> 00:08:56.150
Many countries in the [unclear], they need legitimacy.

00:08:56.150 --> 00:09:02.150
To get legitimacy, governments often need to deliver things like primary education,

00:09:02.150 --> 00:09:07.150
primary health, roads, build hospitals and clinics.

00:09:07.150 --> 00:09:09.150
If the government's fiscal survival

00:09:09.150 --> 00:09:13.150
depends on it having to raise money from its own people,

00:09:13.150 --> 00:09:15.150
such a government is driven by self-interest

00:09:15.150 --> 00:09:17.150
to govern in a more enlightened fashion.

00:09:17.150 --> 00:09:20.150
It will sit with those who create wealth.

00:09:20.150 --> 00:09:23.150
Talk to them about the kind of policies and institutions

00:09:23.150 --> 00:09:27.150
that are necessary for them to expand a scale and scope of business

00:09:27.150 --> 00:09:30.150
so that it can collect more tax revenues from them.

00:09:30.150 --> 00:09:32.150
The problem with the African continent

00:09:32.150 --> 00:09:33.150
and the problem with the aid industry

00:09:33.150 --> 00:09:36.150
is that it has distorted the structure of incentives

00:09:36.150 --> 00:09:39.150
facing the governments in Africa.

00:09:39.150 --> 00:09:42.150
The productive margin in our governments' search for revenue

00:09:42.150 --> 00:09:45.150
does not lie in the domestic economy,

00:09:45.150 --> 00:09:47.150
it lies with international donors.

00:09:47.150 --> 00:09:49.150
Rather than sit with Ugandan --

00:09:49.150 --> 00:09:53.150
(Applause) --

00:09:53.150 --> 00:09:56.150
rather than sit with Ugandan entrepreneurs,

00:09:56.150 --> 00:10:02.150
Ghanaian businessmen, South African enterprising leaders,

00:10:02.150 --> 00:10:05.150
our governments find it more productive

00:10:05.150 --> 00:10:08.150
to talk to the IMF and the World Bank.

00:10:08.150 --> 00:10:12.150
I can tell you, even if you have ten Ph.Ds.,

00:10:12.150 --> 00:10:17.150
you can never beat Bill Gates in understanding the computer industry.

00:10:17.150 --> 00:10:21.150
Why? Because the knowledge that is required for you to understand

00:10:21.150 --> 00:10:23.150
the incentives necessary to expand a business --

00:10:23.150 --> 00:10:29.150
it requires that you listen to the people, the private sector actors in that industry.

00:10:29.150 --> 00:10:32.150
Governments in Africa have therefore been given an opportunity,

00:10:32.150 --> 00:10:35.150
by the international community, to avoid building

00:10:35.150 --> 00:10:37.150
productive arrangements with your own citizens,

00:10:37.150 --> 00:10:43.150
and therefore allowed to begin endless negotiations with the IMF

00:10:43.150 --> 00:10:46.150
and the World Bank, and then it is the IMF and the World Bank

00:10:46.150 --> 00:10:48.150
that tell them what its citizens need.

00:10:48.150 --> 00:10:52.150
In the process, we, the African people, have been sidelined

00:10:52.150 --> 00:10:56.150
from the policy-making, policy-orientation, and policy-

00:10:56.150 --> 00:10:58.150
implementation process in our countries.

00:10:58.150 --> 00:11:02.150
We have limited input, because he who pays the piper calls the tune.

00:11:02.150 --> 00:11:06.150
The IMF, the World Bank, and the cartel of good intentions in the world

00:11:06.150 --> 00:11:09.150
has taken over our rights as citizens,

00:11:09.150 --> 00:11:12.150
and therefore what our governments are doing, because they depend on aid,

00:11:12.150 --> 00:11:16.150
is to listen to international creditors rather than their own citizens.

00:11:16.150 --> 00:11:18.150
But I want to put a caveat on my argument,

00:11:18.150 --> 00:11:26.150
and that caveat is that it is not true that aid is always destructive.

00:11:26.150 --> 00:11:33.150
Some aid may have built a hospital, fed a hungry village.

00:11:33.150 --> 00:11:35.150
It may have built a road, and that road

00:11:35.150 --> 00:11:37.150
may have served a very good role.

00:11:37.150 --> 00:11:39.150
The mistake of the international aid industry

00:11:39.150 --> 00:11:43.150
is to pick these isolated incidents of success,

00:11:43.150 --> 00:11:48.150
generalize them, pour billions and trillions of dollars into them,

00:11:48.150 --> 00:11:50.150
and then spread them across the whole world,

00:11:50.150 --> 00:11:55.150
ignoring the specific and unique circumstances in a given village,

00:11:55.150 --> 00:11:58.150
the skills, the practices, the norms and habits

00:11:58.150 --> 00:12:01.150
that allowed that small aid project to succeed --

00:12:01.150 --> 00:12:04.150
like in Sauri village, in Kenya, where Jeffrey Sachs is working --

00:12:04.150 --> 00:12:07.150
and therefore generalize this experience

00:12:07.150 --> 00:12:10.150
as the experience of everybody.

00:12:10.150 --> 00:12:15.150
Aid increases the resources available to governments,

00:12:15.150 --> 00:12:19.150
and that makes working in a government the most profitable thing

00:12:19.150 --> 00:12:22.150
you can have, as a person in Africa seeking a career.

00:12:22.150 --> 00:12:26.150
By increasing the political attractiveness of the state,

00:12:26.150 --> 00:12:30.150
especially in our ethnically fragmented societies in Africa,

00:12:30.150 --> 00:12:33.150
aid tends to accentuate ethnic tensions

00:12:33.150 --> 00:12:39.150
as every single ethnic group now begins struggling to enter the state

00:12:39.150 --> 00:12:42.150
in order to get access to the foreign aid pie.

00:12:42.150 --> 00:12:47.150
Ladies and gentlemen, the most enterprising people in Africa

00:12:47.150 --> 00:12:52.150
cannot find opportunities to trade and to work in the private sector

00:12:52.150 --> 00:12:55.150
because the institutional and policy environment is hostile to business.

00:12:55.150 --> 00:12:57.150
Governments are not changing it. Why?

00:12:57.150 --> 00:13:02.150
Because they don't need to talk to their own citizens.

00:13:02.150 --> 00:13:04.150
They talk to international donors.

00:13:04.150 --> 00:13:09.150
So, the most enterprising Africans end up going to work for government,

00:13:09.150 --> 00:13:12.150
and that has increased the political tensions in our countries

00:13:12.150 --> 00:13:15.150
precisely because we depend on aid.

00:13:15.150 --> 00:13:19.150
I also want to say that it is important for us to

00:13:19.150 --> 00:13:23.150
note that, over the last 50 years, Africa has been receiving increasing aid

00:13:23.150 --> 00:13:25.150
from the international community,

00:13:25.150 --> 00:13:28.150
in the form of technical assistance, and financial aid,

00:13:28.150 --> 00:13:30.150
and all other forms of aid.

00:13:30.150 --> 00:13:40.150
Between 1960 and 2003, our continent received 600 billion dollars of aid,

00:13:40.150 --> 00:13:43.150
and we are still told that there is a lot of poverty in Africa.

00:13:43.150 --> 00:13:46.150
Where has all the aid gone?

00:13:46.150 --> 00:13:50.150
I want to use the example of my own country, called Uganda,

00:13:50.150 --> 00:13:55.150
and the kind of structure of incentives that aid has brought there.

00:13:55.150 --> 00:14:01.150
In the 2006-2007 budget, expected revenue: 2.5 trillion shillings.

00:14:01.150 --> 00:14:04.150
The expected foreign aid: 1.9 trillion.

00:14:04.150 --> 00:14:08.150
Uganda's recurrent expenditure -- by recurrent what do I mean?

00:14:08.150 --> 00:14:12.150
Hand-to-mouth is 2.6 trillion.

00:14:12.150 --> 00:14:17.150
Why does the government of Uganda budget spend 110 percent

00:14:17.150 --> 00:14:18.150
of its own revenue?

00:14:18.150 --> 00:14:23.150
It's because there's somebody there called foreign aid, who contributes for it.

00:14:23.150 --> 00:14:25.150
But this shows you that the government of Uganda

00:14:25.150 --> 00:14:29.150
is not committed to spending its own revenue

00:14:29.150 --> 00:14:31.150
to invest in productive investments,

00:14:31.150 --> 00:14:33.150
but rather it devotes this revenue

00:14:33.150 --> 00:14:37.150
to paying structure of public expenditure.

00:14:37.150 --> 00:14:42.150
Public administration, which is largely patronage, takes 690 billion.

00:14:42.150 --> 00:14:44.150
The military, 380 billion.

00:14:44.150 --> 00:14:49.150
Agriculture, which employs 18 percent of our poverty-stricken citizens,

00:14:49.150 --> 00:14:52.150
takes only 18 billion.

00:14:52.150 --> 00:14:56.150
Trade and industry takes 43 billion.

00:14:56.150 --> 00:15:00.150
And let me show you, what does public expenditure --

00:15:00.150 --> 00:15:04.150
rather, public administration expenditure -- in Uganda constitute?

00:15:04.150 --> 00:15:10.150
There you go. 70 cabinet ministers, 114 presidential advisers,

00:15:10.150 --> 00:15:13.150
by the way, who never see the president, except on television.

00:15:13.150 --> 00:15:16.150
(Laughter)

00:15:16.150 --> 00:15:21.150
(Applause)

00:15:21.150 --> 00:15:26.150
And when they see him physically, it is at public functions like this,

00:15:26.150 --> 00:15:30.150
and even there, it is him who advises them.

00:15:30.150 --> 00:15:32.150
(Laughter)

00:15:32.150 --> 00:15:35.150
We have 81 units of local government.

00:15:35.150 --> 00:15:37.150
Each local government is organized like the central government --

00:15:37.150 --> 00:15:39.150
a bureaucracy, a cabinet, a parliament,

00:15:39.150 --> 00:15:42.150
and so many jobs for the political hangers-on.

00:15:42.150 --> 00:15:45.150
There were 56, and when our president wanted to

00:15:45.150 --> 00:15:48.150
amend the constitution and remove term limits,

00:15:48.150 --> 00:15:52.150
he had to create 25 new districts, and now there are 81.

00:15:52.150 --> 00:15:54.150
Three hundred thirty-three members of parliament.

00:15:54.150 --> 00:15:56.150
You need Wembley Stadium to host our parliament.

00:15:56.150 --> 00:15:58.150
One hundred thirty-four commissions

00:15:58.150 --> 00:16:03.150
and semi-autonomous government bodies,

00:16:03.150 --> 00:16:07.150
all of which have directors and the cars. And the final thing,

00:16:07.150 --> 00:16:11.150
this is addressed to Mr. Bono. In his work, he may help us on this.

00:16:11.150 --> 00:16:13.150
A recent government of Uganda study found

00:16:13.150 --> 00:16:17.150
that there are 3,000 four-wheel drive motor vehicles

00:16:17.150 --> 00:16:19.150
at the Minister of Health headquarters.

00:16:19.150 --> 00:16:24.150
Uganda has 961 sub-counties, each of them with a dispensary,

00:16:24.150 --> 00:16:26.150
none of which has an ambulance.

00:16:26.150 --> 00:16:29.150
So, the four-wheel drive vehicles at the headquarters

00:16:29.150 --> 00:16:32.150
drive the ministers, the permanent secretaries, the bureaucrats

00:16:32.150 --> 00:16:35.150
and the international aid bureaucrats who work in aid projects,

00:16:35.150 --> 00:16:41.150
while the poor die without ambulances and medicine.

00:16:41.150 --> 00:16:45.150
Finally, I want to say that before I came to speak here,

00:16:45.150 --> 00:16:49.150
I was told that the principle of TEDGlobal

00:16:49.150 --> 00:16:52.150
is that the good speech should be like a miniskirt.

00:16:52.150 --> 00:16:54.150
It should be short enough to arouse interest,

00:16:54.150 --> 00:16:56.150
but long enough to cover the subject.

00:16:56.150 --> 00:16:57.150
I hope I have achieved that.

00:16:57.150 --> 00:16:58.150
(Laughter)

00:16:58.150 --> 00:16:59.150
Thank you very much.

00:16:59.150 --> 00:17:01.150
(Applause)
