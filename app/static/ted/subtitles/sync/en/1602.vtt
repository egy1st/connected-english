00:00:12.216 --> 00:00:15.198
Good morning. So magic is an excellent way

00:00:15.198 --> 00:00:17.241
for staying ahead of the reality curve,

00:00:17.241 --> 00:00:20.156
to make possible today

00:00:20.156 --> 00:00:22.238
what science will make a reality tomorrow.

00:00:22.238 --> 00:00:25.239
As a cyber-magician, I combine elements of illusion

00:00:25.239 --> 00:00:30.198
and science to give us a feel of how future technologies

00:00:30.198 --> 00:00:32.245
might be experienced.

00:00:32.245 --> 00:00:36.150
You've probably all heard of Google's Project Glass.

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:38.177
It's new technology. You look through them

00:00:38.177 --> 00:00:41.150
and the world you see is augmented with data:

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:44.207
names of places, monuments, buildings,

00:00:44.207 --> 00:00:48.223
maybe one day even the names of the strangers that pass you on the street.

00:00:48.223 --> 00:00:52.239
So these are my illusion glasses.

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:56.194
They're a little bigger. They're a prototype.

00:00:56.194 --> 00:00:59.200
And when you look through them, you get a glimpse

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:03.208
into the mind of the cyber-illusionist.

00:01:03.208 --> 00:01:05.233
Let me show you what I mean.

00:01:05.233 --> 00:01:10.214
All we need is a playing card. Any card will do.

00:01:10.214 --> 00:01:14.224
Like this. And let me mark it so we can recognize it

00:01:14.224 --> 00:01:19.212
when we see it again.

00:01:19.212 --> 00:01:23.162
All right. Very significant mark.

00:01:23.162 --> 00:01:25.162
And let's put it back into the deck,

00:01:25.162 --> 00:01:30.156
somewhere in the middle, and let's get started.

00:01:30.156 --> 00:01:31.186
(Music)

00:01:31.186 --> 00:01:34.163
Voice: System ready. Acquiring image.

00:01:34.163 --> 00:01:36.192
Marco Tempest: For those of you who don't play cards,

00:01:36.192 --> 00:01:40.161
a deck of cards is made up of four different suits:

00:01:40.161 --> 00:01:43.162
hearts, clubs,

00:01:43.162 --> 00:01:46.183
diamonds and spades.

00:01:46.183 --> 00:01:49.173
The cards are amongst the oldest of symbols,

00:01:49.173 --> 00:01:54.177
and have been interpreted in many different ways.

00:01:54.177 --> 00:01:58.165
Now, some say that the four suits

00:01:58.165 --> 00:02:02.167
represent the four seasons.

00:02:02.167 --> 00:02:05.237
There's spring, summer,

00:02:05.237 --> 00:02:08.164
autumn and â

00:02:08.164 --> 00:02:11.158
Voice: My favorite season is winter.MT: Well yeah, mine too.

00:02:11.158 --> 00:02:14.175
Winter is like magic. It's a time of change,

00:02:14.175 --> 00:02:17.246
when warmth turns to cold, water turns to snow,

00:02:17.246 --> 00:02:21.220
and then it all disappears.

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:27.243
There are 13 cards in each suit. (Music)

00:02:27.243 --> 00:02:31.200
Voice: Each card represents a phase of the 13 lunar cycles.

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:34.158
MT: So over here is low tide,

00:02:34.158 --> 00:02:36.228
and over here is high tide,

00:02:36.228 --> 00:02:39.216
and in the middle is the moon.

00:02:39.216 --> 00:02:43.176
Voice: The moon is one of the most potent symbols of magic.

00:02:43.176 --> 00:02:47.241
MT: There are two colors in a deck of cards.

00:02:47.241 --> 00:02:50.232
There is the color red

00:02:50.232 --> 00:02:55.169
and the color black,

00:02:55.169 --> 00:02:58.168
representing the constant change

00:02:58.168 --> 00:03:01.168
from day to night.

00:03:01.168 --> 00:03:03.209
Voice: Marco, I did not know you could do that. (Laughter)

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:07.246
MT: And is it a coincidence that there are 52 cards

00:03:07.246 --> 00:03:12.249
in a deck of cards, just as there are 52 weeks in a year?

00:03:12.249 --> 00:03:16.183
(Music)

00:03:16.183 --> 00:03:18.221
Voice: If you total all the spots on a deck of cards,

00:03:18.221 --> 00:03:21.155
the result is 365.

00:03:21.155 --> 00:03:24.199
MT: Oh, 365, the number of days in a year,

00:03:24.199 --> 00:03:27.199
the number of days between

00:03:27.199 --> 00:03:29.234
each birthday.

00:03:29.234 --> 00:03:33.190
Make a wish. (Blowing noise)

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:35.234
Voice: Don't tell, or it won't come true.

00:03:35.234 --> 00:03:38.193
MT: Well, as a matter of fact, it was on my sixth birthday

00:03:38.193 --> 00:03:41.237
that I received my first deck of cards,

00:03:41.237 --> 00:03:46.177
and ever since that day, I have traveled around the world

00:03:46.177 --> 00:03:49.233
performing magic for boys and girls,

00:03:49.233 --> 00:03:52.180
men and women, husbands and wives,

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:58.205
even kings and queens. (Applause)

00:03:58.205 --> 00:04:02.199
Voice: And who are these?MT: Ah, mischief-makers. Watch.

00:04:02.199 --> 00:04:04.208
Wake up.

00:04:04.208 --> 00:04:06.200
Joker: Whoa.MT: Are you ready for your party piece?

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:08.223
Joker: Ready!MT: Let me see what you've got.

00:04:08.223 --> 00:04:11.230
Joker: Presenting my pogo stick.MT: Ah. Watch out.

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:15.164
Joker: Whoa, whoa, whoa, oh! (Music)

00:04:15.164 --> 00:04:20.224
MT: But today, I am performing for a different kind of audience.

00:04:20.224 --> 00:04:23.244
I'm performing for you.

00:04:23.244 --> 00:04:26.242
Voice: Signed card detected.MT: Well, sometimes people ask me

00:04:26.242 --> 00:04:31.171
how do you become a magician? Is it a 9-to-5 job?

00:04:31.171 --> 00:04:34.177
Of course not! You've got to practice 24/7.

00:04:34.177 --> 00:04:38.223
I don't literally mean 24 hours, seven days a week.

00:04:38.223 --> 00:04:42.163
24/7 is a little bit of an exaggeration,

00:04:42.163 --> 00:04:45.215
but it does take practice. Now, some people will say,

00:04:45.215 --> 00:04:50.186
well, magic, that must be the work of some evil

00:04:50.186 --> 00:04:53.194
supernatural force. (Laughter) (Applause)

00:04:53.194 --> 00:04:56.172
(Music)

00:04:56.172 --> 00:05:01.165
Whoa.

00:05:01.165 --> 00:05:05.151
Well, to this, I just say, no no.

00:05:05.151 --> 00:05:07.240
Actually, in German, it's nein nein. (Laughter)

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:11.191
Magic isn't that intense. I have to warn you, though,

00:05:11.191 --> 00:05:15.157
if you ever play with someone who deals cards like this,

00:05:15.157 --> 00:05:18.170
don't play for money.

00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:21.203
(Music)

00:05:21.203 --> 00:05:25.154
Voice: Why not? That's a very good hand.

00:05:25.154 --> 00:05:28.232
The odds of getting it are 4,165 to one.

00:05:28.232 --> 00:05:33.174
MT: Yeah, but I guess my hand is better. We beat the odds.

00:05:33.174 --> 00:05:38.171
Voice: I think you got your birthday wish.MT: And that actually leaves me with the last,

00:05:38.171 --> 00:05:41.182
and most important card of all:

00:05:41.182 --> 00:05:44.183
the one with this very significant mark on it.

00:05:44.183 --> 00:05:47.150
And unlike anything else we've just seen,

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:51.171
virtual or not.Voice: Signed card detected.

00:05:51.171 --> 00:06:00.177
Digital MT: This is without a question the real thing.

00:06:00.177 --> 00:06:09.170
MT: Bye bye. (Music)

00:06:09.170 --> 00:06:12.220
Thank you. (Applause)

00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:15.238
(Applause)

00:06:15.238 --> 00:06:22.207
Thank you very much. (Applause)

00:06:22.207 --> 00:06:26.207
(Applause)
