00:00:12.927 --> 00:00:17.343
Today, I'm going to talk to you about sketching electronics.

00:00:17.343 --> 00:00:22.711
I'm, among several other things, an electrical engineer,

00:00:22.711 --> 00:00:26.408
and that means that I spend a good amount of time

00:00:26.408 --> 00:00:30.782
designing and building new pieces of technology,

00:00:30.782 --> 00:00:35.322
and more specifically designing and building electronics.

00:00:35.322 --> 00:00:39.680
And what I've found is that the process of designing

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:45.274
and building electronics is problematic in all sorts of ways.

00:00:45.274 --> 00:00:50.115
So it's a really slow process, it's really expensive,

00:00:50.115 --> 00:00:52.555
and the outcome of that process,

00:00:52.555 --> 00:00:54.971
namely electronic circuit boards,

00:00:54.971 --> 00:00:58.000
are limited in all sorts of kind of interesting ways.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.640
So they're really small, generally, they're square

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:06.005
and flat and hard, and frankly, most of them

00:01:06.005 --> 00:01:10.318
just aren't very attractive, and so my team and I

00:01:10.318 --> 00:01:14.306
have been thinking of ways to really change and mix up

00:01:14.306 --> 00:01:18.967
the process and the outcome of designing electronics.

00:01:18.967 --> 00:01:23.055
And so what if you could design and build electronics

00:01:23.055 --> 00:01:27.095
like this? So what if you could do it extremely quickly,

00:01:27.095 --> 00:01:32.760
extremely inexpensively, and maybe more interestingly,

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:38.024
really fluidly and expressively and even improvisationally?

00:01:38.024 --> 00:01:41.346
Wouldn't that be so cool, and that wouldn't that open up

00:01:41.346 --> 00:01:43.794
all sorts of new possibilities?

00:01:43.794 --> 00:01:47.178
I'm going to share with you two projects that are

00:01:47.178 --> 00:01:51.887
investigations along these lines, and we'll start with this one.

00:01:51.887 --> 00:01:57.624
(Video) Magnetic electronic pieces and ferrous paper.

00:01:57.624 --> 00:02:01.456
A conductive pen from the Lewis lab at UIUC.

00:02:01.456 --> 00:02:04.330
Sticker templates.

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:06.890
Speed x 4.

00:02:22.409 --> 00:02:26.558
Making a switch.

00:02:34.359 --> 00:02:37.046
Music: DJ Shadow.

00:02:52.325 --> 00:02:55.642
Adding some intelligence with a microcontroller.

00:03:08.885 --> 00:03:12.384
Sketching an interface.

00:03:16.418 --> 00:03:24.217
(Music)

00:03:25.785 --> 00:03:29.955
(Laughter)

00:03:29.955 --> 00:03:35.661
(Applause)

00:03:35.661 --> 00:03:38.658
Pretty cool, huh? We think so.

00:03:38.658 --> 00:03:42.442
So now that we developed these tools

00:03:42.442 --> 00:03:46.180
and found these materials that let us do these things,

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:50.348
we started to realize that, essentially, anything

00:03:50.348 --> 00:03:52.732
that we can do with paper, anything that we can do

00:03:52.732 --> 00:03:55.147
with a piece of paper and a pen

00:03:55.147 --> 00:03:57.564
we can now do with electronics.

00:03:57.564 --> 00:03:59.932
So the next project that I want to show you is kind of a

00:03:59.932 --> 00:04:03.492
deeper exploration of that possibility.

00:04:03.492 --> 00:04:07.356
And I'll kind of let it speak for itself.

00:04:07.356 --> 00:05:37.802
(Music)

00:05:37.802 --> 00:05:43.170
(Applause)

00:05:43.170 --> 00:05:47.970
So the next step for us in this process

00:05:47.970 --> 00:05:51.698
is now to find a way to let all of you

00:05:51.698 --> 00:05:54.594
build things like this,

00:05:54.594 --> 00:05:57.674
and so the way that we're approaching that is by

00:05:57.674 --> 00:06:00.281
teaching workshops to people where we explain

00:06:00.281 --> 00:06:03.394
how they can use these kinds of tools, and then also

00:06:03.394 --> 00:06:07.136
working to get the tools and the materials and techniques

00:06:07.136 --> 00:06:10.886
out into the real world in a variety of ways.

00:06:10.886 --> 00:06:14.470
And so sometime soon, you'll be able to play and build

00:06:14.470 --> 00:06:18.264
and sketch with electronics in this fundamentally new way.

00:06:18.264 --> 00:06:22.264
So thank you very much. (Applause)
