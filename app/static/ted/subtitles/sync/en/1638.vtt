00:00:13.659 --> 00:00:15.975
So a friend of mine who's a political scientist,

00:00:15.975 --> 00:00:17.578
he told me several months ago

00:00:17.578 --> 00:00:19.646
exactly what this month would be like.

00:00:19.646 --> 00:00:22.560
He said, you know, there's this fiscal cliff coming,

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.166
it's going to come at the beginning of 2013.

00:00:26.166 --> 00:00:28.926
Both parties absolutely need to resolve it,

00:00:28.926 --> 00:00:31.751
but neither party wants to be seen as the first to resolve it.

00:00:31.751 --> 00:00:35.968
Neither party has any incentive to solve it a second before it's due,

00:00:35.968 --> 00:00:38.588
so he said, December, you're just going to see lots of

00:00:38.588 --> 00:00:41.808
angry negotiations, negotiations breaking apart,

00:00:41.808 --> 00:00:44.557
reports of phone calls that aren't going well,

00:00:44.557 --> 00:00:46.719
people saying nothing's happening at all,

00:00:46.719 --> 00:00:49.265
and then sometime around Christmas or New Year's,

00:00:49.265 --> 00:00:51.873
we're going to hear, "Okay, they resolved everything."

00:00:51.873 --> 00:00:56.461
He told me that a few months ago. He said he's 98 percent positive they're going to resolve it,

00:00:56.461 --> 00:00:58.895
and I got an email from him today saying, all right,

00:00:58.895 --> 00:01:02.874
we're basically on track, but now I'm 80 percent positive

00:01:02.874 --> 00:01:04.550
that they're going to resolve it.

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:07.094
And it made me think. I love studying

00:01:07.094 --> 00:01:09.087
these moments in American history

00:01:09.087 --> 00:01:12.987
when there was this frenzy of partisan anger,

00:01:12.987 --> 00:01:16.128
that the economy was on the verge of total collapse.

00:01:16.128 --> 00:01:20.368
The most famous early battle was Alexander Hamilton

00:01:20.368 --> 00:01:23.929
and Thomas Jefferson over what the dollar would be

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:26.250
and how it would be backed up, with Alexander Hamilton

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:29.494
saying, "We need a central bank, the First Bank of the United States,

00:01:29.494 --> 00:01:31.293
or else the dollar will have no value.

00:01:31.293 --> 00:01:32.918
This economy won't work,"

00:01:32.918 --> 00:01:35.327
and Thomas Jefferson saying, "The people won't trust that.

00:01:35.327 --> 00:01:39.115
They just fought off a king. They're not going to accept some central authority."

00:01:39.115 --> 00:01:44.637
This battle defined the first 150 years of the U.S. economy,

00:01:44.637 --> 00:01:48.287
and at every moment, different partisans saying,

00:01:48.287 --> 00:01:50.475
"Oh my God, the economy's about to collapse,"

00:01:50.475 --> 00:01:52.624
and the rest of us just going about, spending our bucks

00:01:52.624 --> 00:01:55.848
on whatever it is we wanted to buy.

00:01:55.848 --> 00:01:58.581
To give you a quick primer on where we are,

00:01:58.581 --> 00:02:00.360
a quick refresher on where we are.

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.924
So the fiscal cliff, I was told

00:02:02.924 --> 00:02:05.390
that that's too partisan a thing to say,

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:08.812
although I can't remember which party it's supporting or attacking.

00:02:08.812 --> 00:02:11.173
People say we should call it the fiscal slope,

00:02:11.173 --> 00:02:13.219
or we should call it an austerity crisis,

00:02:13.219 --> 00:02:15.605
but then other people say, no, that's even more partisan.

00:02:15.605 --> 00:02:18.382
So I just call it the self-imposed, self-destructive

00:02:18.382 --> 00:02:23.079
arbitrary deadline about resolving an inevitable problem.

00:02:23.079 --> 00:02:26.706
And this is what the inevitable problem looks like.

00:02:26.706 --> 00:02:31.064
So this is a projection of U.S. debt as a percentage

00:02:31.064 --> 00:02:33.426
of our overall economy, of GDP.

00:02:33.426 --> 00:02:36.794
The light blue dotted line represents

00:02:36.794 --> 00:02:38.923
the Congressional Budget Office's best guess

00:02:38.923 --> 00:02:42.998
of what will happen if Congress really doesn't do anything,

00:02:42.998 --> 00:02:46.514
and as you can see, sometime around 2027,

00:02:46.514 --> 00:02:48.802
we reach Greek levels of debt,

00:02:48.802 --> 00:02:51.690
somewhere around 130 percent of GDP,

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:55.050
which tells you that some time in the next 20 years,

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:57.420
if Congress does absolutely nothing,

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:01.094
we're going to hit a moment where the world's investors,

00:03:01.094 --> 00:03:02.695
the world's bond buyers, are going to say,

00:03:02.695 --> 00:03:05.485
"We don't trust America anymore. We're not going to lend them any money,

00:03:05.485 --> 00:03:07.524
except at really high interest rates."

00:03:07.524 --> 00:03:10.390
And at that moment our economy collapses.

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:12.239
But remember, Greece is there today.

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:16.141
We're there in 20 years. We have lots and lots of time

00:03:16.141 --> 00:03:18.362
to avoid that crisis,

00:03:18.362 --> 00:03:22.057
and the fiscal cliff was just one more attempt

00:03:22.057 --> 00:03:25.594
at trying to force the two sides to resolve the crisis.

00:03:25.594 --> 00:03:29.002
Here's another way to look at exactly the same problem.

00:03:29.002 --> 00:03:31.946
The dark blue line is how much the government spends.

00:03:31.946 --> 00:03:35.403
The light blue line is how much the government gets in.

00:03:35.403 --> 00:03:38.163
And as you can see, for most of recent history,

00:03:38.163 --> 00:03:41.795
except for a brief period, we have consistently spent

00:03:41.795 --> 00:03:44.995
more than we take in. Thus the national debt.

00:03:44.995 --> 00:03:48.874
But as you can also see, projected going forward,

00:03:48.874 --> 00:03:51.890
the gap widens a bit and raises a bit,

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:53.939
and this graph is only through 2021.

00:03:53.939 --> 00:03:57.602
It gets really, really ugly out towards 2030.

00:03:57.602 --> 00:04:01.727
And this graph sort of sums up what the problem is.

00:04:01.727 --> 00:04:04.816
The Democrats, they say, well, this isn't a big deal.

00:04:04.816 --> 00:04:08.934
We can just raise taxes a bit and close that gap,

00:04:08.934 --> 00:04:11.190
especially if we raise taxes on the rich.

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:13.813
The Republicans say, hey, no, no, we've got a better idea.

00:04:13.813 --> 00:04:15.252
Why don't we lower both lines?

00:04:15.252 --> 00:04:19.207
Why don't we lower government spending and lower government taxes,

00:04:19.207 --> 00:04:22.656
and then we'll be on an even more favorable

00:04:22.656 --> 00:04:25.135
long-term deficit trajectory?

00:04:25.135 --> 00:04:29.714
And behind this powerful disagreement between

00:04:29.714 --> 00:04:31.494
how to close that gap,

00:04:31.494 --> 00:04:34.879
there's the worst kind of cynical party politics,

00:04:34.879 --> 00:04:40.252
the worst kind of insider baseball, lobbying, all of that stuff,

00:04:40.252 --> 00:04:44.513
but there's also this powerfully interesting,

00:04:44.513 --> 00:04:46.946
respectful disagreement between

00:04:46.946 --> 00:04:50.473
two fundamentally different economic philosophies.

00:04:50.473 --> 00:04:55.296
And I like to think, when I picture how Republicans

00:04:55.296 --> 00:05:00.427
see the economy, what I picture is just some amazingly

00:05:00.427 --> 00:05:03.738
well-engineered machine, some perfect machine.

00:05:03.738 --> 00:05:08.216
Unfortunately, I picture it made in Germany or Japan,

00:05:08.216 --> 00:05:11.069
but this amazing machine that's constantly scouring

00:05:11.069 --> 00:05:16.165
every bit of human endeavor and taking resources,

00:05:16.165 --> 00:05:18.514
money, labor, capital, machinery,

00:05:18.514 --> 00:05:22.764
away from the least productive parts and towards the more productive parts,

00:05:22.764 --> 00:05:24.360
and while this might cause temporary dislocation,

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:27.854
what it does is it builds up the more productive areas

00:05:27.854 --> 00:05:30.484
and lets the less productive areas fade away and die,

00:05:30.484 --> 00:05:33.260
and as a result the whole system is so much more efficient,

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:35.598
so much richer for everybody.

00:05:35.598 --> 00:05:39.511
And this view generally believes that there is a role for government,

00:05:39.511 --> 00:05:42.331
a small role, to set the rules so people aren't lying

00:05:42.331 --> 00:05:44.580
and cheating and hurting each other,

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:47.884
maybe, you know, have a police force and a fire department

00:05:47.884 --> 00:05:50.884
and an army, but to have a very limited reach

00:05:50.884 --> 00:05:53.884
into the mechanisms of this machinery.

00:05:53.884 --> 00:05:58.060
And when I picture how Democrats and Democratic-leaning

00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:01.028
economists picture this economy,

00:06:01.028 --> 00:06:03.584
most Democratic economists are, you know, they're capitalists,

00:06:03.584 --> 00:06:06.324
they believe, yes, that's a good system a lot of the time.

00:06:06.324 --> 00:06:10.444
It's good to let markets move resources to their more productive use.

00:06:10.444 --> 00:06:14.360
But that system has tons of problems.

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:16.689
Wealth piles up in the wrong places.

00:06:16.689 --> 00:06:20.963
Wealth is ripped away from people who shouldn't be called unproductive.

00:06:20.963 --> 00:06:23.831
That's not going to create an equitable, fair society.

00:06:23.831 --> 00:06:26.703
That machine doesn't care about the environment,

00:06:26.703 --> 00:06:28.769
about racism, about all these issues

00:06:28.769 --> 00:06:31.567
that make this life worse for all of us,

00:06:31.567 --> 00:06:34.646
and so the government does have a role to take resources

00:06:34.646 --> 00:06:37.927
from more productive uses, or from richer sources,

00:06:37.927 --> 00:06:40.595
and give them to other sources.

00:06:40.595 --> 00:06:45.650
And when you think about the economy through these two different lenses,

00:06:45.650 --> 00:06:49.708
you understand why this crisis is so hard to solve,

00:06:49.708 --> 00:06:53.697
because the worse the crisis gets, the higher the stakes are,

00:06:53.697 --> 00:06:56.465
the more each side thinks they know the answer

00:06:56.465 --> 00:06:59.818
and the other side is just going to ruin everything.

00:06:59.818 --> 00:07:02.953
And I can get really despairing. I've spent a lot

00:07:02.953 --> 00:07:06.016
of the last few years really depressed about this,

00:07:06.016 --> 00:07:09.065
until this year, I learned something that

00:07:09.065 --> 00:07:12.545
I felt really excited about. I feel like it's really good news,

00:07:12.545 --> 00:07:15.406
and it's so shocking, I don't like saying it, because I think

00:07:15.406 --> 00:07:16.911
people won't believe me.

00:07:16.911 --> 00:07:18.229
But here's what I learned.

00:07:18.229 --> 00:07:20.649
The American people, taken as a whole,

00:07:20.649 --> 00:07:23.849
when it comes to these issues, to fiscal issues,

00:07:23.849 --> 00:07:27.572
are moderate, pragmatic centrists.

00:07:27.572 --> 00:07:29.837
And I know that's hard to believe, that the American people

00:07:29.837 --> 00:07:31.270
are moderate, pragmatic centrists.

00:07:31.270 --> 00:07:33.851
But let me explain what I'm thinking.

00:07:33.851 --> 00:07:37.148
When you look at how the federal government spends money,

00:07:37.148 --> 00:07:39.722
so this is the battle right here,

00:07:39.722 --> 00:07:42.415
55 percent, more than half, is on Social Security,

00:07:42.415 --> 00:07:44.783
Medicare, Medicaid, a few other health programs,

00:07:44.783 --> 00:07:47.802
20 percent defense, 19 percent discretionary,

00:07:47.802 --> 00:07:49.708
and six percent interest.

00:07:49.708 --> 00:07:54.426
So when we're talking about cutting government spending,

00:07:54.426 --> 00:07:56.432
this is the pie we're talking about,

00:07:56.432 --> 00:08:00.019
and Americans overwhelmingly, and it doesn't matter

00:08:00.019 --> 00:08:03.552
what party they're in, overwhelmingly like

00:08:03.552 --> 00:08:05.991
that big 55 percent chunk.

00:08:05.991 --> 00:08:07.983
They like Social Security. They like Medicare.

00:08:07.983 --> 00:08:11.511
They even like Medicaid, even though that goes to the poor and indigent,

00:08:11.511 --> 00:08:13.935
which you might think would have less support.

00:08:13.935 --> 00:08:17.886
And they do not want it fundamentally touched,

00:08:17.886 --> 00:08:22.077
although the American people are remarkably comfortable,

00:08:22.077 --> 00:08:24.989
and Democrats roughly equal to Republicans,

00:08:24.989 --> 00:08:29.754
with some minor tweaks to make the system more stable.

00:08:29.754 --> 00:08:32.515
Social Security is fairly easy to fix.

00:08:32.515 --> 00:08:36.299
The rumors of its demise are always greatly exaggerated.

00:08:36.299 --> 00:08:38.593
So gradually raise Social Security retirement age,

00:08:38.593 --> 00:08:40.966
maybe only on people not yet born.

00:08:40.966 --> 00:08:43.391
Americans are about 50/50,

00:08:43.391 --> 00:08:45.387
whether they're Democrats or Republicans.

00:08:45.387 --> 00:08:47.739
Reduce Medicare for very wealthy seniors,

00:08:47.739 --> 00:08:51.060
seniors who make a lot of money. Don't even eliminate it. Just reduce it.

00:08:51.060 --> 00:08:56.075
People generally are comfortable with it, Democrats and Republicans.

00:08:56.075 --> 00:08:58.382
Raise medical health care contributions?

00:08:58.382 --> 00:09:00.811
Everyone hates that equally, but Republicans

00:09:00.811 --> 00:09:03.483
and Democrats hate that together.

00:09:03.483 --> 00:09:06.597
And so what this tells me is, when you look at

00:09:06.597 --> 00:09:10.427
the discussion of how to resolve our fiscal problems,

00:09:10.427 --> 00:09:17.812
we are not a nation that's powerfully divided on the major, major issue.

00:09:17.812 --> 00:09:21.093
We're comfortable with it needing some tweaks, but we want to keep it.

00:09:21.093 --> 00:09:23.888
We're not open to a discussion of eliminating it.

00:09:23.888 --> 00:09:28.174
Now there is one issue that is hyper-partisan,

00:09:28.174 --> 00:09:31.656
and where there is one party that is just spend, spend, spend,

00:09:31.656 --> 00:09:33.539
we don't care, spend some more,

00:09:33.539 --> 00:09:35.445
and that of course is Republicans

00:09:35.445 --> 00:09:37.425
when it comes to military defense spending.

00:09:37.425 --> 00:09:39.920
They way outweigh Democrats.

00:09:39.920 --> 00:09:44.715
The vast majority want to protect military defense spending.

00:09:44.715 --> 00:09:46.936
That's 20 percent of the budget,

00:09:46.936 --> 00:09:50.619
and that presents a more difficult issue.

00:09:50.619 --> 00:09:53.544
I should also note that the [discretionary] spending,

00:09:53.544 --> 00:09:55.678
which is about 19 percent of the budget,

00:09:55.678 --> 00:09:58.048
that is Democratic and Republican issues,

00:09:58.048 --> 00:10:00.416
so you do have welfare, food stamps, other programs

00:10:00.416 --> 00:10:02.450
that tend to be popular among Democrats,

00:10:02.450 --> 00:10:05.415
but you also have the farm bill and all sorts of Department of Interior

00:10:05.415 --> 00:10:08.360
inducements for oil drilling and other things,

00:10:08.360 --> 00:10:11.975
which tend to be popular among Republicans.

00:10:11.975 --> 00:10:15.299
Now when it comes to taxes, there is more disagreement.

00:10:15.299 --> 00:10:17.163
That's a more partisan area.

00:10:17.163 --> 00:10:20.557
You have Democrats overwhelmingly supportive

00:10:20.557 --> 00:10:24.606
of raising the income tax on people who make 250,000 dollars a year,

00:10:24.606 --> 00:10:29.846
Republicans sort of against it, although if you break it out by income,

00:10:29.846 --> 00:10:34.539
Republicans who make less than 75,000 dollars a year like this idea.

00:10:34.539 --> 00:10:38.894
So basically Republicans who make more than 250,000 dollars a year don't want to be taxed.

00:10:38.894 --> 00:10:42.150
Raising taxes on investment income, you also see

00:10:42.150 --> 00:10:45.014
about two thirds of Democrats but only one third of Republicans

00:10:45.014 --> 00:10:48.813
are comfortable with that idea.

00:10:48.813 --> 00:10:51.838
This brings up a really important point, which is that

00:10:51.838 --> 00:10:54.454
we tend in this country to talk about Democrats

00:10:54.454 --> 00:10:56.265
and Republicans and think there's this little group

00:10:56.265 --> 00:10:58.630
over there called independents that's, what, two percent?

00:10:58.630 --> 00:11:00.742
If you add Democrats, you add Republicans,

00:11:00.742 --> 00:11:02.236
you've got the American people.

00:11:02.236 --> 00:11:05.182
But that is not the case at all.

00:11:05.182 --> 00:11:10.327
And it has not been the case for most of modern American history.

00:11:10.327 --> 00:11:14.144
Roughly a third of Americans say that they are Democrats.

00:11:14.144 --> 00:11:16.993
Around a quarter say that they are Republicans.

00:11:16.993 --> 00:11:21.473
A tiny little sliver call themselves libertarians, or socialists,

00:11:21.473 --> 00:11:24.160
or some other small third party,

00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:29.367
and the largest block, 40 percent, say they're independents.

00:11:29.367 --> 00:11:32.288
So most Americans are not partisan,

00:11:32.288 --> 00:11:34.456
and most of the people in the independent camp

00:11:34.456 --> 00:11:38.147
fall somewhere in between, so even though we have

00:11:38.147 --> 00:11:41.707
tremendous overlap between the views on these fiscal issues

00:11:41.707 --> 00:11:44.003
of Democrats and Republicans,

00:11:44.003 --> 00:11:47.795
we have even more overlap when you add in the independents.

00:11:47.795 --> 00:11:51.035
Now we get to fight about all sorts of other issues.

00:11:51.035 --> 00:11:53.148
We get to hate each other on gun control

00:11:53.148 --> 00:11:55.428
and abortion and the environment,

00:11:55.428 --> 00:11:58.300
but on these fiscal issues, these important fiscal issues,

00:11:58.300 --> 00:12:02.132
we just are not anywhere nearly as divided as people say.

00:12:02.132 --> 00:12:04.164
And in fact, there's this other group of people

00:12:04.164 --> 00:12:07.502
who are not as divided as people might think,

00:12:07.502 --> 00:12:09.515
and that group is economists.

00:12:09.515 --> 00:12:14.818
I talk to a lot of economists, and back in the '70s

00:12:14.818 --> 00:12:17.916
and '80s it was ugly being an economist.

00:12:17.916 --> 00:12:21.091
You were in what they called the saltwater camp,

00:12:21.091 --> 00:12:25.705
meaning Harvard, Princeton, MIT, Stanford, Berkeley,

00:12:25.705 --> 00:12:28.673
or you were in the freshwater camp, University of Chicago,

00:12:28.673 --> 00:12:30.125
University of Rochester.

00:12:30.125 --> 00:12:33.121
You were a free market capitalist economist

00:12:33.121 --> 00:12:35.254
or you were a Keynesian liberal economist,

00:12:35.254 --> 00:12:37.429
and these people didn't go to each other's weddings,

00:12:37.429 --> 00:12:39.321
they snubbed each other at conferences.

00:12:39.321 --> 00:12:42.330
It's still ugly to this day, but in my experience,

00:12:42.330 --> 00:12:45.931
it is really, really hard to find an economist under 40

00:12:45.931 --> 00:12:49.955
who still has that kind of way of seeing the world.

00:12:49.955 --> 00:12:52.907
The vast majority of economists -- it is so uncool

00:12:52.907 --> 00:12:55.748
to call yourself an ideologue of either camp.

00:12:55.748 --> 00:12:58.269
The phrase that you want, if you're a graduate student

00:12:58.269 --> 00:13:00.796
or a postdoc or you're a professor,

00:13:00.796 --> 00:13:03.773
a 38-year-old economics professor, is, "I'm an empiricist.

00:13:03.773 --> 00:13:05.317
I go by the data."

00:13:05.317 --> 00:13:07.721
And the data is very clear.

00:13:07.721 --> 00:13:11.742
None of these major theories have been completely successful.

00:13:11.742 --> 00:13:13.390
The 20th century, the last hundred years,

00:13:13.390 --> 00:13:16.341
is riddled with disastrous examples

00:13:16.341 --> 00:13:20.013
of times that one school or the other tried to explain

00:13:20.013 --> 00:13:22.333
the past or predict the future

00:13:22.333 --> 00:13:24.219
and just did an awful, awful job,

00:13:24.219 --> 00:13:29.408
so the economics profession has acquired some degree of modesty.

00:13:29.408 --> 00:13:33.002
They still are an awfully arrogant group of people, I will assure you,

00:13:33.002 --> 00:13:35.879
but they're now arrogant about their impartiality,

00:13:35.879 --> 00:13:42.670
and they, too, see a tremendous range of potential outcomes.

00:13:42.670 --> 00:13:47.770
And this nonpartisanship is something that exists,

00:13:47.770 --> 00:13:49.509
that has existed in secret

00:13:49.509 --> 00:13:51.225
in America for years and years and years.

00:13:51.225 --> 00:13:55.189
I've spent a lot of the fall talking to the three major

00:13:55.189 --> 00:13:59.085
organizations that survey American political attitudes:

00:13:59.085 --> 00:14:00.639
Pew Research,

00:14:00.639 --> 00:14:04.287
the University of Chicago's National Opinion Research Center,

00:14:04.287 --> 00:14:07.135
and the most important but the least known

00:14:07.135 --> 00:14:10.110
is the American National Election Studies group

00:14:10.110 --> 00:14:14.456
that is the world's longest, most respected poll of political attitudes.

00:14:14.456 --> 00:14:16.418
They've been doing it since 1948,

00:14:16.418 --> 00:14:19.905
and what they show consistently throughout

00:14:19.905 --> 00:14:24.352
is that it's almost impossible to find Americans

00:14:24.352 --> 00:14:27.513
who are consistent ideologically,

00:14:27.513 --> 00:14:31.249
who consistently support, "No we mustn't tax,

00:14:31.249 --> 00:14:33.929
and we must limit the size of government,"

00:14:33.929 --> 00:14:37.629
or, "No, we must encourage government to play a larger role

00:14:37.629 --> 00:14:41.625
in redistribution and correcting the ills of capitalism."

00:14:41.625 --> 00:14:43.503
Those groups are very, very small.

00:14:43.503 --> 00:14:46.499
The vast majority of people, they pick and choose,

00:14:46.499 --> 00:14:49.063
they see compromise and they change over time

00:14:49.063 --> 00:14:51.596
when they hear a better argument or a worse argument.

00:14:51.596 --> 00:14:54.957
And that part of it has not changed.

00:14:54.957 --> 00:14:58.910
What has changed is how people respond to vague questions.

00:14:58.910 --> 00:15:01.508
If you ask people vague questions, like,

00:15:01.508 --> 00:15:04.500
"Do you think there should be more government or less government?"

00:15:04.500 --> 00:15:08.814
"Do you think government should" — especially if you use loaded language --

00:15:08.814 --> 00:15:11.293
"Do you think the government should provide handouts?"

00:15:11.293 --> 00:15:13.222
Or, "Do you think the government should redistribute?"

00:15:13.222 --> 00:15:15.823
Then you can see radical partisan change.

00:15:15.823 --> 00:15:18.517
But when you get specific, when you actually ask

00:15:18.517 --> 00:15:22.557
about the actual taxing and spending issues under consideration,

00:15:22.557 --> 00:15:25.165
people are remarkably centrist,

00:15:25.165 --> 00:15:28.030
they're remarkably open to compromise.

00:15:28.030 --> 00:15:31.815
So what we have, then, when you think about the fiscal cliff,

00:15:31.815 --> 00:15:36.341
don't think of it as the American people fundamentally

00:15:36.341 --> 00:15:38.517
can't stand each other on these issues

00:15:38.517 --> 00:15:40.072
and that we must be ripped apart

00:15:40.072 --> 00:15:42.394
into two separate warring nations.

00:15:42.394 --> 00:15:48.320
Think of it as a tiny, tiny number of ancient economists

00:15:48.320 --> 00:15:52.166
and misrepresentative ideologues have captured the process.

00:15:52.166 --> 00:15:54.742
And they've captured the process through familiar ways,

00:15:54.742 --> 00:15:57.694
through a primary system which encourages

00:15:57.694 --> 00:15:59.926
that small group of people's voices,

00:15:59.926 --> 00:16:02.031
because that small group of people,

00:16:02.031 --> 00:16:05.103
the people who answer all yeses or all noes

00:16:05.103 --> 00:16:07.510
on those ideological questions,

00:16:07.510 --> 00:16:10.117
they might be small but every one of them has a blog,

00:16:10.117 --> 00:16:13.871
every one of them has been on Fox or MSNBC in the last week.

00:16:13.871 --> 00:16:17.024
Every one of them becomes a louder and louder voice,

00:16:17.024 --> 00:16:19.156
but they don't represent us.

00:16:19.156 --> 00:16:22.257
They don't represent what our views are.

00:16:22.257 --> 00:16:24.063
And that gets me back to the dollar,

00:16:24.063 --> 00:16:27.288
and it gets me back to reminding myself that

00:16:27.288 --> 00:16:29.298
we know this experience.

00:16:29.298 --> 00:16:30.943
We know what it's like

00:16:30.943 --> 00:16:36.298
to have these people on TV, in Congress,

00:16:36.298 --> 00:16:39.025
yelling about how the end of the world is coming

00:16:39.025 --> 00:16:42.251
if we don't adopt their view completely,

00:16:42.251 --> 00:16:44.245
because it's happened about the dollar

00:16:44.245 --> 00:16:46.248
ever since there's been a dollar.

00:16:46.248 --> 00:16:50.142
We had the battle between Jefferson and Hamilton.

00:16:50.142 --> 00:16:54.812
In 1913, we had this ugly battle over the Federal Reserve,

00:16:54.812 --> 00:16:58.686
when it was created, with vicious, angry arguments

00:16:58.686 --> 00:17:00.558
over how it would be constituted,

00:17:00.558 --> 00:17:02.335
and a general agreement that the way it was constituted

00:17:02.335 --> 00:17:05.242
was the worst possible compromise,

00:17:05.242 --> 00:17:08.602
a compromise guaranteed to destroy this valuable thing,

00:17:08.602 --> 00:17:10.959
this dollar, but then everyone agreeing, okay,

00:17:10.959 --> 00:17:13.470
so long as we're on the gold standard, it should be okay.

00:17:13.470 --> 00:17:15.520
The Fed can't mess it up so badly.

00:17:15.520 --> 00:17:19.657
But then we got off the gold standard for individuals

00:17:19.657 --> 00:17:22.071
during the Depression and we got off the gold standard

00:17:22.071 --> 00:17:26.169
as a source of international currency coordination

00:17:26.169 --> 00:17:28.401
during Richard Nixon's presidency.

00:17:28.401 --> 00:17:32.374
Each of those times, we were on the verge of complete collapse.

00:17:32.374 --> 00:17:34.528
And nothing happened at all.

00:17:34.528 --> 00:17:36.466
Throughout it all, the dollar has been

00:17:36.466 --> 00:17:38.774
one of the most long-standing,

00:17:38.774 --> 00:17:40.909
stable, reasonable currencies,

00:17:40.909 --> 00:17:43.076
and we all use it every single day,

00:17:43.076 --> 00:17:46.101
no matter what the people screaming about tell us,

00:17:46.101 --> 00:17:49.145
no matter how scared we're supposed to be.

00:17:49.145 --> 00:17:53.090
And this long-term fiscal picture that we're in right now,

00:17:53.090 --> 00:17:57.019
I think what is most maddening about it is,

00:17:57.019 --> 00:18:00.958
if Congress were simply able

00:18:00.958 --> 00:18:03.331
to show not that they agree with each other,

00:18:03.331 --> 00:18:06.611
not that they're able to come up with the best possible compromise,

00:18:06.611 --> 00:18:09.693
but that they are able to just begin the process

00:18:09.693 --> 00:18:14.174
towards compromise, we all instantly are better off.

00:18:14.174 --> 00:18:18.308
The fear is that the world is watching.

00:18:18.308 --> 00:18:21.765
The fear is that the longer we delay any solution,

00:18:21.765 --> 00:18:23.553
the more the world will look to the U.S.

00:18:23.553 --> 00:18:27.173
not as the bedrock of stability in the global economy,

00:18:27.173 --> 00:18:30.748
but as a place that can't resolve its own fights,

00:18:30.748 --> 00:18:34.574
and the longer we put that off, the more we make the world nervous,

00:18:34.574 --> 00:18:36.357
the higher interest rates are going to be,

00:18:36.357 --> 00:18:39.061
the quicker we're going to have to face a day

00:18:39.061 --> 00:18:41.168
of horrible calamity.

00:18:41.168 --> 00:18:44.732
And so just the act of compromise itself,

00:18:44.732 --> 00:18:46.633
and sustained, real compromise,

00:18:46.633 --> 00:18:48.447
would give us even more time,

00:18:48.447 --> 00:18:51.409
would allow both sides even longer to spread out the pain

00:18:51.409 --> 00:18:54.044
and reach even more compromise down the road.

00:18:54.044 --> 00:18:57.156
So I'm in the media. I feel like my job to make this happen

00:18:57.156 --> 00:19:01.449
is to help foster the things that seem to lead to compromise,

00:19:01.449 --> 00:19:05.561
to not talk about this in those vague and scary terms

00:19:05.561 --> 00:19:07.122
that do polarize us,

00:19:07.122 --> 00:19:09.731
but to just talk about it like what it is,

00:19:09.731 --> 00:19:11.674
not an existential crisis,

00:19:11.674 --> 00:19:16.647
not some battle between two fundamentally different religious views,

00:19:16.647 --> 00:19:19.249
but a math problem, a really solvable math problem,

00:19:19.249 --> 00:19:21.325
one where we're not all going to get what we want

00:19:21.325 --> 00:19:25.280
and one where, you know, there's going to be a little pain to spread around.

00:19:25.280 --> 00:19:28.795
But the more we address it as a practical concern,

00:19:28.795 --> 00:19:30.306
the sooner we can resolve it,

00:19:30.306 --> 00:19:33.773
and the more time we have to resolve it, paradoxically.

00:19:33.773 --> 00:19:38.757
Thank you. (Applause)
