00:00:12.801 --> 00:00:15.980
It was a Saturday afternoon in May,

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:18.494
and I suddenly realized

00:00:18.494 --> 00:00:21.948
that the next day was Mother's Day,

00:00:21.948 --> 00:00:23.794
and I hadn't gotten anything for my mom,

00:00:23.794 --> 00:00:25.195
so I started thinking about

00:00:25.195 --> 00:00:27.532
what should I get my mom for Mother's Day?

00:00:27.532 --> 00:00:29.376
I thought, why don't I make her

00:00:29.376 --> 00:00:32.425
an interactive Mother's Day card

00:00:32.425 --> 00:00:35.133
using the Scratch software that I'd been developing

00:00:35.133 --> 00:00:38.950
with my research group at the MIT Media Lab?

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:42.330
We developed it so that people could easily create

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:46.574
their own interactive stories and games and animations,

00:00:46.574 --> 00:00:50.343
and then share their creations with one another.

00:00:50.343 --> 00:00:54.211
So I thought, this would be an opportunity to use Scratch

00:00:54.211 --> 00:00:57.111
to make an interactive card for my mom.

00:00:57.111 --> 00:00:59.287
Before making my own Mother's Day card,

00:00:59.287 --> 00:01:01.272
I thought I would take a look

00:01:01.272 --> 00:01:02.845
at the Scratch website.

00:01:02.845 --> 00:01:06.203
So over the last several years, kids around the world

00:01:06.203 --> 00:01:09.397
ages 8 and up, have shared their projects,

00:01:09.397 --> 00:01:12.832
and I thought, I wonder if, of those three million projects,

00:01:12.832 --> 00:01:16.217
whether anyone else has thought to put up Mother's Day cards.

00:01:16.217 --> 00:01:19.211
So in the search box I typed in

00:01:19.211 --> 00:01:20.756
"Mother's Day,"

00:01:20.756 --> 00:01:23.759
and I was surprised and delighted to see a list

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:26.463
of dozens and dozens of Mother's Day cards

00:01:26.463 --> 00:01:28.977
that showed up on the Scratch website,

00:01:28.977 --> 00:01:31.295
many of them just in the past 24 hours

00:01:31.295 --> 00:01:34.501
by procrastinators just like myself.

00:01:34.501 --> 00:01:37.623
So I started taking a look at them. (Music)

00:01:37.623 --> 00:01:40.079
I saw one of them that featured a kitten

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:46.950
and her mom and wishing her mom a happy Mother's Day.

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.481
And the creator very considerately

00:01:49.481 --> 00:01:52.985
offered a replay for her mom.

00:01:52.985 --> 00:01:55.369
Another one was an interactive project where,

00:01:55.369 --> 00:01:58.567
when you moved the mouse over the letters of "Happy Mom Day,"

00:01:58.567 --> 00:02:03.487
it reveals a special happy Mother's Day slogan.

00:02:03.487 --> 00:02:07.470
(Music) In this one, the creator told a narrative

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:10.129
about how she had Googled to find out

00:02:10.129 --> 00:02:13.246
when Mother's Day was happening.

00:02:13.246 --> 00:02:17.389
(Typing) And then once she found out when Mother's Day was happening,

00:02:17.389 --> 00:02:19.867
she delivered a special Mother's Day greeting

00:02:19.867 --> 00:02:23.494
of how much she loved her mom.

00:02:23.494 --> 00:02:25.719
So I really enjoyed looking at these projects

00:02:25.719 --> 00:02:27.371
and interacting with these projects.

00:02:27.371 --> 00:02:31.212
In fact, I liked it so much that, instead of making my own project,

00:02:31.212 --> 00:02:35.966
I sent my mom links to about a dozen of these projects. (Laughter)

00:02:35.966 --> 00:02:39.546
And actually, she reacted exactly the way that I hoped that she would.

00:02:39.546 --> 00:02:40.931
She wrote back to me and she said,

00:02:40.931 --> 00:02:44.198
"I'm so proud to have a son that created the software

00:02:44.198 --> 00:02:48.310
that allowed these kids to make Mother's Day cards for their mothers."

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:52.110
So my mom was happy, and that made me happy,

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:56.734
but actually I was even happier for another reason.

00:02:56.734 --> 00:03:00.693
I was happy because these kids were using Scratch

00:03:00.693 --> 00:03:03.494
just in the way that we had hoped that they would.

00:03:03.494 --> 00:03:06.305
As they created their interactive Mother's Day cards,

00:03:06.305 --> 00:03:08.586
you could see that they were really

00:03:08.586 --> 00:03:11.898
becoming fluent with new technologies.

00:03:11.898 --> 00:03:13.361
What do I mean by fluent?

00:03:13.361 --> 00:03:17.393
I mean that they were able to start expressing themselves

00:03:17.393 --> 00:03:20.170
and to start expressing their ideas.

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:22.824
When you become fluent with language,

00:03:22.824 --> 00:03:26.361
it means you can write an entry in your journal

00:03:26.361 --> 00:03:30.414
or tell a joke to someone or write a letter to a friend.

00:03:30.414 --> 00:03:33.571
And it's similar with new technologies.

00:03:33.571 --> 00:03:37.753
By writing, be creating these interactive Mother's Day cards,

00:03:37.753 --> 00:03:40.283
these kids were showing that they were really fluent

00:03:40.283 --> 00:03:41.956
with new technologies.

00:03:41.956 --> 00:03:44.721
Now maybe you won't be so surprised by this,

00:03:44.721 --> 00:03:47.417
because a lot of times people feel that

00:03:47.417 --> 00:03:50.817
young people today can do all sorts of things with technology.

00:03:50.817 --> 00:03:55.278
I mean, all of us have heard young people referred to as "digital natives."

00:03:55.278 --> 00:03:59.075
But actually I'm sort of skeptical about this term.

00:03:59.075 --> 00:04:02.576
I'm not so sure we should be thinking of young people as digital natives.

00:04:02.576 --> 00:04:05.129
When you really look at it, how is it that young people

00:04:05.129 --> 00:04:08.665
spend most of their time using new technologies?

00:04:08.665 --> 00:04:12.188
You often see them in situations like this,

00:04:12.188 --> 00:04:14.382
or like this,

00:04:14.382 --> 00:04:15.900
and there's no doubt that young people

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:19.216
are very comfortable and familiar browsing

00:04:19.216 --> 00:04:23.738
and chatting and texting and gaming.

00:04:23.738 --> 00:04:26.937
But that doesn't really make you fluent.

00:04:26.937 --> 00:04:30.896
So young people today have lots of experience

00:04:30.896 --> 00:04:34.691
and lots of familiarity with interacting with new technologies,

00:04:34.691 --> 00:04:38.096
but a lot less so of creating with new technologies

00:04:38.096 --> 00:04:41.068
and expressing themselves with new technologies.

00:04:41.068 --> 00:04:43.460
It's almost as if they can read

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:46.793
but not write with new technologies.

00:04:46.793 --> 00:04:50.691
And I'm really interested in seeing, how can we help young people become fluent

00:04:50.691 --> 00:04:53.220
so they can write with new technologies?

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:56.580
And that really means that they need to be able to

00:04:56.580 --> 00:05:01.092
write their own computer programs, or code.

00:05:01.092 --> 00:05:03.804
So, increasingly, people are starting to recognize

00:05:03.804 --> 00:05:07.108
the importance of learning to code.

00:05:07.108 --> 00:05:09.710
You know, in recent years, there have been

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:12.602
hundreds of new organizations and websites

00:05:12.602 --> 00:05:15.896
that are helping young people learn to code.

00:05:15.896 --> 00:05:19.487
You look online, you'll see places like Codecademy

00:05:19.487 --> 00:05:21.858
and events like CoderDojo

00:05:21.858 --> 00:05:24.289
and sites like Girls Who Code,

00:05:24.289 --> 00:05:25.983
or Black Girls Code.

00:05:25.983 --> 00:05:29.091
It seems that everybody is getting into the act.

00:05:29.091 --> 00:05:31.674
You know, just at the beginning of this year,

00:05:31.674 --> 00:05:33.039
at the turn of the new year,

00:05:33.039 --> 00:05:35.699
New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg

00:05:35.699 --> 00:05:37.959
made a New Year's resolution that he was going to learn

00:05:37.959 --> 00:05:40.738
to code in 2012.

00:05:40.738 --> 00:05:43.906
A few months later, the country of Estonia decided that

00:05:43.906 --> 00:05:47.562
all of its first graders should learn to code.

00:05:47.562 --> 00:05:50.354
And that triggered a debate in the U.K.

00:05:50.354 --> 00:05:54.663
about whether all the children there should learn to code.

00:05:54.663 --> 00:05:57.506
Now, for some of you, when you hear about this,

00:05:57.506 --> 00:06:01.114
it might seem sort of strange about everybody learning to code.

00:06:01.114 --> 00:06:04.264
When many people think of coding, they think of it

00:06:04.264 --> 00:06:07.840
as something that only a very narrow sub-community

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:10.498
of people are going to be doing,

00:06:10.498 --> 00:06:13.420
and they think of coding looking like this.

00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:15.586
And in fact, if this is what coding is like,

00:06:15.586 --> 00:06:18.081
it will only be a narrow sub-community of people

00:06:18.081 --> 00:06:21.153
with special mathematical skills and technological background

00:06:21.153 --> 00:06:23.419
that can code.

00:06:23.419 --> 00:06:25.919
But coding doesn't have to be like this.

00:06:25.919 --> 00:06:29.898
Let me show you about what it's like to code in Scratch.

00:06:29.898 --> 00:06:34.177
So in Scratch, to code, you just snap blocks together.

00:06:34.177 --> 00:06:36.092
In this case, you take a move block,

00:06:36.092 --> 00:06:37.861
snap it into a stack,

00:06:37.861 --> 00:06:40.619
and the stacks of blocks control the behaviors

00:06:40.619 --> 00:06:44.137
of the different characters in your game or your story,

00:06:44.137 --> 00:06:46.438
in this case controlling the big fish.

00:06:46.438 --> 00:06:49.889
After you've created your program, you can click on "share,"

00:06:49.889 --> 00:06:52.965
and then share your project with other people,

00:06:52.965 --> 00:06:54.788
so that they can use the project

00:06:54.788 --> 00:06:57.762
and start working on the project as well.

00:06:57.762 --> 00:07:01.084
So, of course, making a fish game isn't the only thing

00:07:01.084 --> 00:07:02.729
you can do with Scratch.

00:07:02.729 --> 00:07:04.709
Of the millions of projects on the Scratch website,

00:07:04.709 --> 00:07:07.533
there's everything from animated stories

00:07:07.533 --> 00:07:09.949
to school science projects

00:07:09.949 --> 00:07:12.013
to anime soap operas

00:07:12.013 --> 00:07:14.335
to virtual construction kits

00:07:14.335 --> 00:07:17.048
to recreations of classic video games

00:07:17.048 --> 00:07:19.317
to political opinion polls

00:07:19.317 --> 00:07:21.957
to trigonometry tutorials

00:07:21.957 --> 00:07:24.877
to interactive artwork, and, yes,

00:07:24.877 --> 00:07:27.661
interactive Mother's Day cards.

00:07:27.661 --> 00:07:30.697
So I think there's so many different ways

00:07:30.697 --> 00:07:34.157
that people can express themselves using this,

00:07:34.157 --> 00:07:37.557
to be able to take their ideas and share their ideas with the world.

00:07:37.557 --> 00:07:40.119
And it doesn't just stay on the screen.

00:07:40.119 --> 00:07:43.886
You can also code to interact with the physical world around you.

00:07:43.886 --> 00:07:46.365
Here's an example from Hong Kong,

00:07:46.365 --> 00:07:47.772
where some kids made a game

00:07:47.772 --> 00:07:51.053
and then built their own physical interface device

00:07:51.053 --> 00:07:53.945
and had a light sensor, so the light sensor

00:07:53.945 --> 00:07:55.888
detects the hole in the board,

00:07:55.888 --> 00:07:58.088
so as they move the physical saw,

00:07:58.088 --> 00:08:00.328
the light sensor detects the hole

00:08:00.328 --> 00:08:03.284
and controls the virtual saw on the screen

00:08:03.284 --> 00:08:06.064
and saws down the tree.

00:08:06.064 --> 00:08:08.173
We're going to continue to look at new ways

00:08:08.173 --> 00:08:11.229
of bringing together the physical world and the virtual world

00:08:11.229 --> 00:08:14.157
and connecting to the world around us.

00:08:14.157 --> 00:08:16.390
This is an example from a new version of Scratch

00:08:16.390 --> 00:08:20.013
that we'll be releasing in the next few months,

00:08:20.013 --> 00:08:22.063
and we're looking again to be able

00:08:22.063 --> 00:08:23.759
to push you in new directions.

00:08:23.759 --> 00:08:26.023
Here's an example.

00:08:26.023 --> 00:08:30.097
It uses the webcam.

00:08:30.097 --> 00:08:34.953
And as I move my hand, I can pop the balloons

00:08:34.953 --> 00:08:37.838
or I can move the bug.

00:08:37.838 --> 00:08:40.403
So it's a little bit like Microsoft Kinect,

00:08:40.403 --> 00:08:43.119
where you interact with gestures in the world.

00:08:43.119 --> 00:08:45.363
But instead of just playing someone else's game,

00:08:45.363 --> 00:08:47.605
you get to create the games,

00:08:47.605 --> 00:08:48.988
and if you see someone else's game,

00:08:48.988 --> 00:08:51.628
you can just say "see inside,"

00:08:51.628 --> 00:08:54.522
and you can look at the stacks of blocks that control it.

00:08:54.522 --> 00:08:58.077
So there's a new block that says how much video motion there is,

00:08:58.077 --> 00:09:01.198
and then, if there's so much video motion,

00:09:01.198 --> 00:09:04.577
it will then tell the balloon to pop.

00:09:04.577 --> 00:09:06.961
The same way that this uses the camera

00:09:06.961 --> 00:09:09.466
to get information into Scratch,

00:09:09.466 --> 00:09:12.473
you can also use the microphone.

00:09:12.473 --> 00:09:16.457
Here's an example of a project using the microphone.

00:09:16.457 --> 00:09:18.857
So I'm going to let all of you control this game

00:09:18.857 --> 00:09:21.103
using your voices.

00:09:21.103 --> 00:09:37.559
(Crickets chirping) (Shouts) (Chomping)

00:09:37.559 --> 00:09:46.188
(Laughter)

00:09:46.188 --> 00:09:54.972
(Applause)

00:09:54.972 --> 00:09:57.577
As kids are creating projects like this,

00:09:57.577 --> 00:09:59.842
they're learning to code,

00:09:59.842 --> 00:10:03.776
but even more importantly, they're coding to learn.

00:10:03.776 --> 00:10:06.065
Because as they learn to code,

00:10:06.065 --> 00:10:09.385
it enables them to learn many other things,

00:10:09.385 --> 00:10:12.257
opens up many new opportunities for learning.

00:10:12.257 --> 00:10:16.641
Again, it's useful to make an analogy to reading and writing.

00:10:16.641 --> 00:10:19.581
When you learn to read and write, it opens up

00:10:19.581 --> 00:10:22.641
opportunities for you to learn so many other things.

00:10:22.641 --> 00:10:26.401
When you learn to read, you can then read to learn.

00:10:26.401 --> 00:10:28.589
And it's the same thing with coding.

00:10:28.589 --> 00:10:31.136
If you learn to code, you can code to learn.

00:10:31.136 --> 00:10:33.690
Now some of the things you can learn are sort of obvious.

00:10:33.690 --> 00:10:36.188
You learn more about how computers work.

00:10:36.188 --> 00:10:38.506
But that's just where it starts.

00:10:38.506 --> 00:10:41.101
When you learn to code, it opens up for you to learn

00:10:41.101 --> 00:10:43.346
many other things.

00:10:43.346 --> 00:10:45.692
Let me show you an example.

00:10:45.692 --> 00:10:47.962
Here's another project,

00:10:47.962 --> 00:10:50.230
and I saw this when I was visiting

00:10:50.230 --> 00:10:52.372
one of the computer clubhouses.

00:10:52.372 --> 00:10:55.392
These are after-school learning centers that we helped start

00:10:55.392 --> 00:10:58.154
that help young people from low-income communities

00:10:58.154 --> 00:11:02.233
learn to express themselves creatively with new technologies.

00:11:02.233 --> 00:11:05.028
And when I went to one of the clubhouses a couple years ago,

00:11:05.028 --> 00:11:08.753
I saw a 13-year-old boy who was using our Scratch software

00:11:08.753 --> 00:11:11.649
to create a game somewhat like this one,

00:11:11.649 --> 00:11:14.572
and he was very happy with his game and proud of his game,

00:11:14.572 --> 00:11:17.537
but also he wanted to do more.

00:11:17.537 --> 00:11:19.841
He wanted to keep score.

00:11:19.841 --> 00:11:22.917
So this was a game where the big fish eats the little fish,

00:11:22.917 --> 00:11:25.844
but he wanted to keep score, so that each time

00:11:25.844 --> 00:11:29.222
the big fish eats the little fish,

00:11:29.222 --> 00:11:31.761
the score would go up and it would keep track,

00:11:31.761 --> 00:11:34.273
and he didn't know how to do that.

00:11:34.273 --> 00:11:36.538
So I showed him.

00:11:36.538 --> 00:11:40.115
In Scratch, you can create something called a variable.

00:11:40.115 --> 00:11:44.242
I'll call it score.

00:11:44.242 --> 00:11:47.073
And that creates some new blocks for you,

00:11:47.073 --> 00:11:51.739
and also creates a little scoreboard that keeps track of the score,

00:11:51.739 --> 00:11:56.991
so each time I click on "change score," it increments the score.

00:11:56.991 --> 00:11:59.516
So I showed this to the clubhouse member --

00:11:59.516 --> 00:12:02.217
let's call him Victor -- and Victor,

00:12:02.217 --> 00:12:05.019
when he saw that this block would let him increment the score,

00:12:05.019 --> 00:12:06.835
he knew exactly what to do.

00:12:06.835 --> 00:12:09.149
He took the block

00:12:09.149 --> 00:12:12.193
and he put it into the program

00:12:12.193 --> 00:12:16.386
exactly where the big fish eats the little fish.

00:12:16.386 --> 00:12:21.409
So then, each time the big fish eats the little fish,

00:12:21.409 --> 00:12:27.404
he will increment the score, and the score will go up by one.

00:12:27.404 --> 00:12:29.101
And it's in fact working.

00:12:29.101 --> 00:12:31.355
And he saw this, and he was so excited,

00:12:31.355 --> 00:12:33.034
he reached his hand out to me,

00:12:33.034 --> 00:12:35.583
and he said, "Thank you, thank you, thank you."

00:12:35.583 --> 00:12:37.652
And what went through my mind was,

00:12:37.652 --> 00:12:40.694
how often is it that teachers are thanked by their students

00:12:40.694 --> 00:12:44.097
for teaching them variables? (Laughter)

00:12:44.097 --> 00:12:46.578
It doesn't happen in most classrooms,

00:12:46.578 --> 00:12:49.537
but that's because in most classrooms, when kids learn about variables,

00:12:49.537 --> 00:12:52.045
they don't know why they're learning it.

00:12:52.045 --> 00:12:54.916
It's nothing that, really, they can make use of.

00:12:54.916 --> 00:12:57.078
When you learn ideas like this in Scratch,

00:12:57.078 --> 00:13:01.181
you can learn it in a way that's really meaningful and motivating for you,

00:13:01.181 --> 00:13:04.171
that you can understand the reason for learning variables,

00:13:04.171 --> 00:13:06.213
and we see that kids learn it more deeply

00:13:06.213 --> 00:13:07.628
and learn it better.

00:13:07.628 --> 00:13:10.669
Victor had, I'm sure, been taught about variables in schools,

00:13:10.669 --> 00:13:12.857
but he really didn't -- he wasn't paying attention.

00:13:12.857 --> 00:13:15.140
Now he had a reason for learning variables.

00:13:15.140 --> 00:13:18.214
So when you learn through coding, and coding to learn,

00:13:18.214 --> 00:13:23.098
you're learning it in a meaningful context, and that's the best way of learning things.

00:13:23.098 --> 00:13:26.553
So as kids like Victor are creating projects like this,

00:13:26.553 --> 00:13:29.337
they're learning important concepts like variables,

00:13:29.337 --> 00:13:31.465
but that's just the start.

00:13:31.465 --> 00:13:35.315
As Victor worked on this project and created the scripts,

00:13:35.315 --> 00:13:38.567
he was also learning about the process of design,

00:13:38.567 --> 00:13:41.186
how to start with the glimmer of an idea

00:13:41.186 --> 00:13:44.092
and turn it into a fully-fledged, functioning project

00:13:44.092 --> 00:13:46.599
like you see here.

00:13:46.599 --> 00:13:50.639
So he was learning many different core principles of design,

00:13:50.639 --> 00:13:53.881
about how to experiment with new ideas,

00:13:53.881 --> 00:13:58.586
how to take complex ideas and break them down into simpler parts,

00:13:58.586 --> 00:14:01.576
how to collaborate with other people on your projects,

00:14:01.576 --> 00:14:05.027
about how to find and fix bugs when things go wrong,

00:14:05.027 --> 00:14:08.081
how to keep persistent and to persevere

00:14:08.081 --> 00:14:11.486
in the face of frustrations when things aren't working well.

00:14:11.486 --> 00:14:13.259
Now those are important skills

00:14:13.259 --> 00:14:16.127
that aren't just relevant for coding.

00:14:16.127 --> 00:14:18.954
They're relevant for all sorts of different activities.

00:14:18.954 --> 00:14:22.122
Now, who knows if Victor is going to grow up and become

00:14:22.122 --> 00:14:25.046
a programmer or a professional computer scientist?

00:14:25.046 --> 00:14:26.858
It's probably not so likely,

00:14:26.858 --> 00:14:28.646
but regardless of what he does,

00:14:28.646 --> 00:14:32.350
he'll be able to make use of these design skills that he learned.

00:14:32.350 --> 00:14:34.934
Regardless of whether he grows up to be a marketing manager

00:14:34.934 --> 00:14:38.054
or a mechanic or a community organizer,

00:14:38.054 --> 00:14:40.510
that these ideas are useful for everybody.

00:14:40.510 --> 00:14:44.432
Again, it's useful to think about this analogy with language.

00:14:44.432 --> 00:14:48.788
When you become fluent with reading and writing,

00:14:48.788 --> 00:14:51.229
it's not something that you're doing

00:14:51.229 --> 00:14:53.189
just to become a professional writer.

00:14:53.189 --> 00:14:55.886
Very few people become professional writers.

00:14:55.886 --> 00:14:59.454
But it's useful for everybody to learn how to read and write.

00:14:59.454 --> 00:15:01.549
Again, the same thing with coding.

00:15:01.549 --> 00:15:03.771
Most people won't grow up to become professional

00:15:03.771 --> 00:15:06.990
computer scientists or programmers,

00:15:06.990 --> 00:15:09.328
but those skills of thinking creatively,

00:15:09.328 --> 00:15:11.842
reasoning systematically, working collaboratively --

00:15:11.842 --> 00:15:14.552
skills you develop when you code in Scratch --

00:15:14.552 --> 00:15:19.374
are things that people can use no matter what they're doing in their work lives.

00:15:19.374 --> 00:15:21.750
And it's not just about your work life.

00:15:21.750 --> 00:15:24.470
Coding can also enable you to

00:15:24.470 --> 00:15:27.646
express your ideas and feelings in your personal life.

00:15:27.646 --> 00:15:30.319
Let me end with just one more example.

00:15:30.319 --> 00:15:33.446
So this is an example that came from

00:15:33.446 --> 00:15:37.914
after I had sent the Mother's Day cards to my mom,

00:15:37.914 --> 00:15:41.015
she decided that she wanted to learn Scratch.

00:15:41.015 --> 00:15:44.046
So she made this project for my birthday

00:15:44.046 --> 00:15:47.622
and sent me a happy birthday Scratch card.

00:15:47.622 --> 00:15:51.478
Now this project is not going to win any prizes for design,

00:15:51.478 --> 00:15:54.453
and you can rest assured that my 83-year-old mom

00:15:54.453 --> 00:15:58.690
is not training to become a professional programmer or computer scientist.

00:15:58.690 --> 00:16:01.662
But working on this project enabled her

00:16:01.662 --> 00:16:04.328
to make a connection to someone that she cares about

00:16:04.328 --> 00:16:07.136
and enabled her to keep on learning new things

00:16:07.136 --> 00:16:09.568
and continuing to practice her creativity

00:16:09.568 --> 00:16:12.743
and developing new ways of expressing herself.

00:16:12.743 --> 00:16:16.954
So as we take a look and we see that

00:16:16.954 --> 00:16:19.518
Michael Bloomberg is learning to code,

00:16:19.518 --> 00:16:22.168
all of the children of Estonia learn to code,

00:16:22.168 --> 00:16:24.368
even my mom has learned to code,

00:16:24.368 --> 00:16:26.140
don't you think it's about time that you might be

00:16:26.140 --> 00:16:28.052
thinking about learning to code?

00:16:28.052 --> 00:16:30.245
If you're interested in giving it a try,

00:16:30.245 --> 00:16:32.681
I'd encourage you to go to the Scratch website.

00:16:32.681 --> 00:16:34.706
It's scratch.mit.edu,

00:16:34.706 --> 00:16:36.528
and give a try at coding.

00:16:36.528 --> 00:16:40.646
Thanks very much. (Applause)
