00:00:12.913 --> 00:00:15.528
Organic chemists make molecules,

00:00:15.528 --> 00:00:17.344
very complicated molecules,

00:00:17.344 --> 00:00:21.028
by chopping up a big molecule into small molecules

00:00:21.028 --> 00:00:22.889
and reverse engineering.

00:00:22.889 --> 00:00:23.928
And as a chemist,

00:00:23.928 --> 00:00:27.395
one of the things I wanted to ask my research group a couple of years ago is,

00:00:27.395 --> 00:00:31.546
could we make a really cool universal chemistry set?

00:00:31.546 --> 00:00:36.579
In essence, could we "app" chemistry?

00:00:36.579 --> 00:00:39.762
Now what would this mean, and how would we do it?

00:00:39.762 --> 00:00:41.733
Well to start to do this,

00:00:41.733 --> 00:00:43.465
we took a 3D printer

00:00:43.465 --> 00:00:47.767
and we started to print our beakers and our test tubes on one side

00:00:47.767 --> 00:00:51.832
and then print the molecule at the same time on the other side

00:00:51.832 --> 00:00:54.986
and combine them together in what we call reactionware.

00:00:54.986 --> 00:00:59.420
And so by printing the vessel and doing the chemistry at the same time,

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:04.587
we may start to access this universal toolkit of chemistry.

00:01:04.587 --> 00:01:06.135
Now what could this mean?

00:01:06.135 --> 00:01:11.403
Well if we can embed biological and chemical networks like a search engine,

00:01:11.403 --> 00:01:14.552
so if you have a cell that's ill that you need to cure

00:01:14.552 --> 00:01:16.271
or bacteria that you want to kill,

00:01:16.271 --> 00:01:18.602
if you have this embedded in your device

00:01:18.602 --> 00:01:21.051
at the same time, and you do the chemistry,

00:01:21.051 --> 00:01:24.652
you may be able to make drugs in a new way.

00:01:24.652 --> 00:01:27.052
So how are we doing this in the lab?

00:01:27.052 --> 00:01:30.151
Well it requires software, it requires hardware

00:01:30.151 --> 00:01:32.517
and it requires chemical inks.

00:01:32.517 --> 00:01:33.970
And so the really cool bit is,

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:37.017
the idea is that we want to have a universal set of inks

00:01:37.017 --> 00:01:39.286
that we put out with the printer,

00:01:39.286 --> 00:01:43.568
and you download the blueprint, the organic chemistry for that molecule

00:01:43.568 --> 00:01:46.568
and you make it in the device.

00:01:46.568 --> 00:01:52.135
And so you can make your molecule in the printer using this software.

00:01:52.135 --> 00:01:54.334
So what could this mean?

00:01:54.334 --> 00:01:59.281
Well, ultimately, it could mean that you could print your own medicine.

00:01:59.281 --> 00:02:01.250
And this is what we're doing in the lab at the moment.

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:03.152
But to take baby steps to get there,

00:02:03.152 --> 00:02:05.985
first of all we want to look at drug design and production,

00:02:05.985 --> 00:02:08.635
or drug discovery and manufacturing.

00:02:08.635 --> 00:02:11.634
Because if we can manufacture it after we've discovered it,

00:02:11.634 --> 00:02:13.768
we could deploy it anywhere.

00:02:13.768 --> 00:02:15.884
You don't need to go to the chemist anymore.

00:02:15.884 --> 00:02:18.252
We can print drugs at point of need.

00:02:18.252 --> 00:02:20.907
We can download new diagnostics.

00:02:20.907 --> 00:02:22.918
Say a new super bug has emerged.

00:02:22.918 --> 00:02:24.535
You put it in your search engine,

00:02:24.535 --> 00:02:27.668
and you create the drug to treat the threat.

00:02:27.668 --> 00:02:31.356
So this allows you on-the-fly molecular assembly.

00:02:31.356 --> 00:02:34.351
But perhaps for me the core bit going into the future

00:02:34.351 --> 00:02:37.701
is this idea of taking your own stem cells,

00:02:37.701 --> 00:02:39.468
with your genes and your environment,

00:02:39.468 --> 00:02:42.917
and you print your own personal medicine.

00:02:42.917 --> 00:02:45.169
And if that doesn't seem fanciful enough,

00:02:45.169 --> 00:02:47.217
where do you think we're going to go?

00:02:47.217 --> 00:02:51.801
Well, you're going to have your own personal matter fabricator.

00:02:51.801 --> 00:02:53.701
Beam me up, Scotty.

00:02:53.701 --> 00:02:57.050
(Applause)
