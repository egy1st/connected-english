00:00:12.956 --> 00:00:14.731
Okay, this morning I'm speaking

00:00:14.731 --> 00:00:17.920
on the question of corruption.

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:20.080
And corruption is defined

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:25.816
as the abuse of a position of trust

00:00:25.816 --> 00:00:29.456
for the benefit of yourself -- or, in the case of our context,

00:00:29.456 --> 00:00:32.079
your friends, your family or your financiers.

00:00:32.079 --> 00:00:36.602
Okay? Friends, family and financiers.

00:00:36.602 --> 00:00:40.617
But we need to understand what we understand about corruption,

00:00:40.617 --> 00:00:43.415
and we need to understand that

00:00:43.415 --> 00:00:46.764
we have been miseducated about it, and we have to admit that.

00:00:46.764 --> 00:00:48.321
We have to have the courage to admit that

00:00:48.321 --> 00:00:50.766
to start changing how we deal with it.

00:00:50.766 --> 00:00:53.689
The first thing is that the big myth, number one,

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:56.060
is that in fact it's not really a crime.

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:57.850
When we get together with friends and family

00:00:57.850 --> 00:00:59.729
and we discuss crime in our country,

00:00:59.729 --> 00:01:03.322
crime in Belmont or crime in Diego or crime in Marabella,

00:01:03.322 --> 00:01:04.852
nobody's speaking about corruption.

00:01:04.852 --> 00:01:06.402
That's the honest truth.

00:01:06.402 --> 00:01:09.439
When the Commissioner of Police comes on TV to talk about crime,

00:01:09.439 --> 00:01:11.449
he isn't speaking about corruption.

00:01:11.449 --> 00:01:13.765
And we know for sure when the Minister of National Security

00:01:13.765 --> 00:01:17.640
is speaking about crime, he's not talking about corruption either.

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.255
The point I'm making is that it is a crime.

00:01:20.255 --> 00:01:25.105
It is an economic crime, because we're involving the looting of taxpayers' money.

00:01:25.105 --> 00:01:27.873
Public and private corruption is a reality.

00:01:27.873 --> 00:01:29.604
As somebody who comes from the private sector,

00:01:29.604 --> 00:01:32.000
I can tell you there's a massive amount of corruption

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.779
in the private sector that has nothing to do with government.

00:01:34.779 --> 00:01:37.621
The same bribes and backhanders and things that take place under the table,

00:01:37.621 --> 00:01:40.089
it all takes place in the private sector.

00:01:40.089 --> 00:01:43.690
Today, I'm focusing on public sector corruption,

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:46.825
which the private sector also participates in.

00:01:46.825 --> 00:01:49.121
The second important myth to understand --

00:01:49.121 --> 00:01:50.855
because we have to destroy these myths,

00:01:50.855 --> 00:01:53.315
dismantle them and destroy them and ridicule them --

00:01:53.315 --> 00:01:55.261
the second important myth to understand

00:01:55.261 --> 00:01:57.753
is the one that says

00:01:57.753 --> 00:02:01.022
that in fact corruption is only a small problem --

00:02:01.022 --> 00:02:03.352
if it is a problem, it's only a small problem,

00:02:03.352 --> 00:02:07.046
that in fact it's only a little 10 or 15 percent,

00:02:07.046 --> 00:02:10.937
it's been going on forever, it probably will continue forever,

00:02:10.937 --> 00:02:14.721
and there's no point passing any laws, because there's little we can do about it.

00:02:14.721 --> 00:02:17.081
And I want to demonstrate that that, too,

00:02:17.081 --> 00:02:19.018
is a dangerous myth, very dangerous.

00:02:19.018 --> 00:02:21.439
It's a piece of public mischief.

00:02:21.439 --> 00:02:24.033
And I want to speak a little bit,

00:02:24.033 --> 00:02:26.281
take us back about 30 years.

00:02:26.281 --> 00:02:28.275
We're coming out today from Trinidad and Tobago,

00:02:28.275 --> 00:02:31.473
a resource-rich, small Caribbean country,

00:02:31.473 --> 00:02:36.519
and in the early 1970s we had a massive increase in the country's wealth,

00:02:36.519 --> 00:02:40.012
and that increase was caused by the increase in world oil prices.

00:02:40.012 --> 00:02:43.047
We call them petrodollars. The treasury was bursting with money.

00:02:43.047 --> 00:02:46.735
And it's ironic, because

00:02:46.735 --> 00:02:48.773
we're standing today in the Central Bank.

00:02:48.773 --> 00:02:50.969
You see, history's rich in irony.

00:02:50.969 --> 00:02:52.791
We're standing today in the Central Bank,

00:02:52.791 --> 00:02:56.169
and the Central Bank is responsible for a lot of the things I'm going to be speaking about.

00:02:56.169 --> 00:02:59.494
Okay? We're talking about irresponsibility in public office.

00:02:59.494 --> 00:03:02.242
We're speaking about the fact that across the terrace,

00:03:02.242 --> 00:03:04.281
the next tower is the Ministry of Finance,

00:03:04.281 --> 00:03:05.969
and there's a lot of connection with us today,

00:03:05.969 --> 00:03:08.819
so we're speaking within your temple today. Okay?

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:13.719
(Applause)

00:03:13.719 --> 00:03:15.961
The first thing I want to talk about is that

00:03:15.961 --> 00:03:19.657
when all of this money flowed into our country about 40 years ago,

00:03:19.657 --> 00:03:21.744
we embarked, the government of the day embarked

00:03:21.744 --> 00:03:23.854
on a series of government-to-government arrangements

00:03:23.854 --> 00:03:25.888
to have rapidly develop the country.

00:03:25.888 --> 00:03:28.154
And some of the largest projects in the country

00:03:28.154 --> 00:03:31.352
were being constructed through government-to-government arrangements

00:03:31.352 --> 00:03:33.168
with some of the leading countries in the world,

00:03:33.168 --> 00:03:35.876
the United States and Britain and France and so on and so on.

00:03:35.876 --> 00:03:38.944
As I said, even this building we're standing in -- that's one of the ironies --

00:03:38.944 --> 00:03:40.628
this building was part of that series of complexes,

00:03:40.628 --> 00:03:44.736
what they called the Twin Towers.

00:03:44.736 --> 00:03:47.696
It became so outrageous, the whole situation,

00:03:47.696 --> 00:03:50.576
that in fact a commission of inquiry was appointed,

00:03:50.576 --> 00:03:54.579
and it reported in 1982, 30 years ago it reported --

00:03:54.579 --> 00:03:57.328
the Ballah Report -- 30 years ago,

00:03:57.328 --> 00:04:01.264
and immediately the government-to-government arrangements were stopped.

00:04:01.264 --> 00:04:03.172
The then-Prime Minister went to Parliament

00:04:03.172 --> 00:04:06.369
to give a budget speech, and he said some things that I'll never forget.

00:04:06.369 --> 00:04:08.666
They went right in here. I was a young man at the time.

00:04:08.666 --> 00:04:10.046
It went right into my heart.

00:04:10.046 --> 00:04:14.803
And he said that, in fact — Let me see if this thing works.

00:04:14.803 --> 00:04:17.280
Are we getting a, yeah?—

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:19.279
That's what he told us.

00:04:19.279 --> 00:04:23.419
He told us that, in fact,

00:04:23.419 --> 00:04:26.341
two out of every three dollars of our petrodollars

00:04:26.341 --> 00:04:28.725
that we spent, the taxpayers' money,

00:04:28.725 --> 00:04:30.809
was wasted or stolen.

00:04:30.809 --> 00:04:34.852
So the 10 or 15 percent is pure mischief.

00:04:34.852 --> 00:04:36.961
As we say, it's a nancy-story. Forget it.

00:04:36.961 --> 00:04:38.656
That's for little children. We are big people,

00:04:38.656 --> 00:04:41.443
and we're trying to deal with what's happening in our society.

00:04:41.443 --> 00:04:43.588
Okay? This is the size of the problem.

00:04:43.588 --> 00:04:46.600
Okay? Two thirds of the money stolen or wasted.

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:50.042
That was 30 years ago. 1982 was Ballah.

00:04:50.042 --> 00:04:52.101
So what has changed?

00:04:52.101 --> 00:04:53.788
I don't like to bring up embarrassing secrets

00:04:53.788 --> 00:04:56.347
to an international audience, but I have to.

00:04:56.347 --> 00:04:59.860
Four months ago, we suffered a constitutional outrage in this country.

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:04.758
We call it the Section 34 fiasco, the Section 34 fiasco,

00:05:04.758 --> 00:05:07.404
a suspicious piece of law, and I'm going to say it like it is,

00:05:07.404 --> 00:05:08.759
a suspicious piece of law

00:05:08.759 --> 00:05:10.902
was passed at a suspicious time

00:05:10.902 --> 00:05:12.800
to free some suspects. (Laughter)

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:19.533
And it was called, those people are called

00:05:19.533 --> 00:05:21.107
the Piarco Airport accused.

00:05:21.107 --> 00:05:23.984
I'm going to have my own lexicon speaking here today.

00:05:23.984 --> 00:05:25.811
They are the Piarco Airport accused.

00:05:25.811 --> 00:05:28.704
It was a constitutional outrage of the first order,

00:05:28.704 --> 00:05:32.760
and I have labeled it the Plot to Pervert Parliament.

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:35.859
Our highest institution in our country was perverted.

00:05:35.859 --> 00:05:37.832
We are dealing with perverts here

00:05:37.832 --> 00:05:39.554
of an economic and financial nature.

00:05:39.554 --> 00:05:41.403
Do you get how serious this problem is?

00:05:41.403 --> 00:05:43.513
There was massive protest. A lot of us in this room

00:05:43.513 --> 00:05:46.223
took part in the protest in different forms.

00:05:46.223 --> 00:05:49.042
Most importantly, the American embassy complained,

00:05:49.042 --> 00:05:51.529
so Parliament was swiftly reconvened,

00:05:51.529 --> 00:05:53.434
and the law was reversed, it was repealed.

00:05:53.434 --> 00:05:55.381
That's the word lawyers use. It was repealed.

00:05:55.381 --> 00:05:58.498
But the point is

00:05:58.498 --> 00:06:02.193
that Parliament was outwitted in the whole course of events,

00:06:02.193 --> 00:06:04.679
because what really happened is that,

00:06:04.679 --> 00:06:07.753
because of the suspicious passage of that law,

00:06:07.753 --> 00:06:10.074
the law was actually passed into effect

00:06:10.074 --> 00:06:13.332
on the weekend we celebrated our 50th anniversary of independence,

00:06:13.332 --> 00:06:14.892
our jubilee of independence.

00:06:14.892 --> 00:06:16.914
So that is the kind of outrage of the thing.

00:06:16.914 --> 00:06:20.325
It was kind of a nasty way to get maturation, but we got it,

00:06:20.325 --> 00:06:22.012
because we all understood it,

00:06:22.012 --> 00:06:23.770
and for the first time that I could remember,

00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:27.320
there were mass protests against this corruption.

00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:29.511
And that gave me a lot of hope. Okay?

00:06:29.511 --> 00:06:31.374
Those of us who are, sometimes you feel like

00:06:31.374 --> 00:06:34.743
you're a little bit on your own doing some of this work.

00:06:34.743 --> 00:06:38.191
That passage of the law and the repeal of the law

00:06:38.191 --> 00:06:42.167
fortified the case of the Piarco Airport accused.

00:06:42.167 --> 00:06:46.778
So it was one of those really superior double bluff kind of things that took place.

00:06:46.778 --> 00:06:48.674
But what were they accused of?

00:06:48.674 --> 00:06:49.777
What was it that they were accused of?

00:06:49.777 --> 00:06:53.056
I'm being a bit mysterious for those of you out there. What were they accused of?

00:06:53.056 --> 00:06:55.638
We were trying to build, or reconstruct largely,

00:06:55.638 --> 00:06:58.240
an airport that had grown outdated.

00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:02.030
The entire project cost about 1.6 billion dollars,

00:07:02.030 --> 00:07:04.597
Trinidad and Tobago dollars,

00:07:04.597 --> 00:07:07.760
and in fact, we had a lot of bid-rigging

00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:10.947
and suspicious activity, corrupt activity took place.

00:07:10.947 --> 00:07:15.037
And to get an idea of what it consisted of,

00:07:15.037 --> 00:07:17.917
and to put it in context in relationship to this whole

00:07:17.917 --> 00:07:20.350
second myth about it being no big thing,

00:07:20.350 --> 00:07:23.121
we can look at this second slide here.

00:07:23.121 --> 00:07:26.814
And what we have here -- I am not saying so,

00:07:26.814 --> 00:07:31.621
this is the Director of Public Prosecutions in a written statement. He said so.

00:07:31.621 --> 00:07:36.095
And he's telling us that for the $1.6 billion cost of the project,

00:07:36.095 --> 00:07:38.287
one billion dollars has been traced

00:07:38.287 --> 00:07:40.050
to offshore bank accounts.

00:07:40.050 --> 00:07:42.213
One billion dollars of our taxpayers' money

00:07:42.213 --> 00:07:45.611
has been located in offshore bank accounts.

00:07:45.611 --> 00:07:47.724
Being the kind of suspicious person I am,

00:07:47.724 --> 00:07:50.441
I am outraged at that, and I'm going to pause here,

00:07:50.441 --> 00:07:52.937
I'm going to pause now and again and bring in different things.

00:07:52.937 --> 00:07:54.751
I'm going to pause here and bring in something I saw

00:07:54.751 --> 00:07:58.495
in November last year at Wall Street. I was at Zuccotti Park.

00:07:58.495 --> 00:08:02.687
It was autumn. It was cool. It was damp. It was getting dark.

00:08:02.687 --> 00:08:04.620
And I was walking around with the protesters

00:08:04.620 --> 00:08:08.913
looking at the One Wall Street, Occupy Wall Street movement walking around.

00:08:08.913 --> 00:08:11.233
And there was a lady with a sign, a very simple sign,

00:08:11.233 --> 00:08:13.657
a kind of battered-looking blonde lady,

00:08:13.657 --> 00:08:16.480
and the sign was made out of Bristol board, as we say in these parts,

00:08:16.480 --> 00:08:18.472
and it was made with a marker.

00:08:18.472 --> 00:08:20.993
And what it said on that sign hit me right in the center.

00:08:20.993 --> 00:08:25.400
It said, "If you're not outraged, you haven't been paying attention."

00:08:25.400 --> 00:08:28.382
If you're not outraged by all of this, you haven't been paying attention.

00:08:28.382 --> 00:08:32.513
So listen up, because we're getting into even deeper waters.

00:08:32.513 --> 00:08:34.670
My brain started thinking.

00:08:34.670 --> 00:08:37.561
Well, what if --

00:08:37.561 --> 00:08:40.767
because I'm suspicious like that. I read a lot of spy novels and stuff.

00:08:40.767 --> 00:08:42.445
What if -- (Laughter)

00:08:42.445 --> 00:08:44.969
But to make it in these wrongs,

00:08:44.969 --> 00:08:46.594
you have to read a lot of spy novels

00:08:46.594 --> 00:08:49.161
and follow some of that stuff, right? (Laughter)

00:08:49.161 --> 00:08:53.728
But what if this wasn't the first time?

00:08:53.728 --> 00:08:56.315
What if this is just the first time

00:08:56.315 --> 00:08:58.650
that the so-and-sos had been caught?

00:08:58.650 --> 00:09:03.776
What if it had happened before? How would I find out?

00:09:03.776 --> 00:09:06.266
Now, the previous two examples I gave

00:09:06.266 --> 00:09:10.322
were to do with construction sector corruption, okay?

00:09:10.322 --> 00:09:12.353
And I have the privilege at this time

00:09:12.353 --> 00:09:15.731
to lead the Joint Consultative Council, which is a not-for-profit.

00:09:15.731 --> 00:09:19.328
We're at jcc.org.tt, and we have the -- we are the leaders

00:09:19.328 --> 00:09:22.554
in the struggle to produce a new public procurement system

00:09:22.554 --> 00:09:24.714
about how public money is transacted.

00:09:24.714 --> 00:09:26.919
So those of you interested in finding out more about it,

00:09:26.919 --> 00:09:31.199
or joining us or signing up on any of our petitions, please get involved.

00:09:31.199 --> 00:09:33.458
But I'm going to segue to another thing that relates,

00:09:33.458 --> 00:09:36.234
because one of my private campaigns I've been conducting

00:09:36.234 --> 00:09:38.570
for over three and a half years

00:09:38.570 --> 00:09:41.059
is for transparency and accountability

00:09:41.059 --> 00:09:44.158
around the bailout of CL Financial.

00:09:44.158 --> 00:09:49.159
CL Financial is the Caribbean's largest ever conglomerate, okay?

00:09:49.159 --> 00:09:52.082
And without getting into all of the details,

00:09:52.082 --> 00:09:55.098
it is said to have collapsed — I'm using my words very carefully —

00:09:55.098 --> 00:09:57.925
it's said to have collapsed in January of '09,

00:09:57.925 --> 00:10:01.603
which is just coming up to nearly four years.

00:10:01.603 --> 00:10:04.415
In an unprecedented fit of generosity --

00:10:04.415 --> 00:10:06.898
and you have to be very suspicious about these people --

00:10:06.898 --> 00:10:09.529
in an unprecedented — and I'm using that word carefully —

00:10:09.529 --> 00:10:13.413
unprecedented fit of generosity, the government of the day

00:10:13.413 --> 00:10:17.068
signed, made a written commitment, to repay all of the creditors.

00:10:17.068 --> 00:10:19.390
And I can tell you without fear of contradiction

00:10:19.390 --> 00:10:22.572
that hasn't happened anywhere else on the planet.

00:10:22.572 --> 00:10:24.483
Let's understand, because we lack context.

00:10:24.483 --> 00:10:27.488
People are telling us it's just like Wall Street. It's not just like Wall Street.

00:10:27.488 --> 00:10:31.977
Trinidad and Tobago is like a place with different laws of physics or biology or something.

00:10:31.977 --> 00:10:36.721
It's not just like anywhere. (Applause)

00:10:36.721 --> 00:10:41.875
It's not just like anywhere. It's not just like anywhere.

00:10:41.875 --> 00:10:44.706
Here is here, and out there is out there. Okay?

00:10:44.706 --> 00:10:46.036
I'm serious now.

00:10:46.036 --> 00:10:49.019
Listen. They've had bailouts on Wall Street.

00:10:49.019 --> 00:10:50.970
They've had bailouts in London.

00:10:50.970 --> 00:10:53.107
They've had bailouts in Europe.

00:10:53.107 --> 00:10:55.777
In Africa, they've had bailouts. In Nigeria, six of the major

00:10:55.777 --> 00:10:58.342
commercial banks collapsed at the same time as ours, eh?

00:10:58.342 --> 00:11:00.583
It's interesting to parallel how the Nigerian experience has --

00:11:00.583 --> 00:11:02.973
how they've treated it, and they've treated it

00:11:02.973 --> 00:11:04.844
very well compared to us.

00:11:04.844 --> 00:11:06.776
Nowhere on the planet

00:11:06.776 --> 00:11:09.482
have all the creditors been bailed out

00:11:09.482 --> 00:11:11.774
in excess of what their statutory entitlements were.

00:11:11.774 --> 00:11:15.356
Only here. So what was the reason for the generosity?

00:11:15.356 --> 00:11:18.161
Is our government that generous? And maybe they are.

00:11:18.161 --> 00:11:20.177
Let's look at it. Let's look into it.

00:11:20.177 --> 00:11:22.945
So I started digging and writing and so and so on,

00:11:22.945 --> 00:11:24.757
and that work can be found, my personal work

00:11:24.757 --> 00:11:28.137
can be found at AfraRaymond.com, which is my name.

00:11:28.137 --> 00:11:31.009
It's a not-for-profit blog that I run.

00:11:31.009 --> 00:11:33.533
Not as popular as some of the other people, but there you go.

00:11:33.533 --> 00:11:35.791
(Laughter)

00:11:35.791 --> 00:11:40.280
But the point is that the bitter experience of Section 34,

00:11:40.280 --> 00:11:42.737
that plot to pervert Parliament, that bitter experience

00:11:42.737 --> 00:11:45.823
that took place in August,

00:11:45.823 --> 00:11:48.721
when we were supposed to be celebrating our independence,

00:11:48.721 --> 00:11:53.385
going into September, forced me to check myself

00:11:53.385 --> 00:11:55.444
and recalculate my bearings,

00:11:55.444 --> 00:11:57.666
and to go back into some of the work, some of the stuff I'd written

00:11:57.666 --> 00:11:59.935
and some of the exchanges I'd had with the officials

00:11:59.935 --> 00:12:01.939
to see what was really what.

00:12:01.939 --> 00:12:06.049
As we say in Trinidad and Tobago, who is who and what is what?

00:12:06.049 --> 00:12:07.873
Okay? We want to try to recalculate.

00:12:07.873 --> 00:12:10.297
And I made a Freedom of Information application

00:12:10.297 --> 00:12:14.211
in May this year to the Ministry of Finance.

00:12:14.211 --> 00:12:16.269
The Ministry of Finance is the next tower over.

00:12:16.269 --> 00:12:17.944
This is the other context.

00:12:17.944 --> 00:12:20.020
The Ministry of Finance, we are told,

00:12:20.020 --> 00:12:23.849
is subject to the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act.

00:12:23.849 --> 00:12:27.153
I'm going to take you through a worked example of whether that's really so.

00:12:27.153 --> 00:12:30.041
The Central Bank in which we stand this morning

00:12:30.041 --> 00:12:34.238
is immune from the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act.

00:12:34.238 --> 00:12:35.917
So in fact, you can't ask them anything,

00:12:35.917 --> 00:12:37.610
and they don't have to answer anything.

00:12:37.610 --> 00:12:40.432
That is the law since 1999.

00:12:40.432 --> 00:12:44.008
So I plunged into this struggle, and I asked four questions.

00:12:44.008 --> 00:12:47.697
And I'll relate the questions to you in the short form with the reply,

00:12:47.697 --> 00:12:50.312
so you could understand, as I said, where we are.

00:12:50.312 --> 00:12:51.833
Here is not like anywhere else.

00:12:51.833 --> 00:12:54.811
Question number one:

00:12:54.811 --> 00:12:57.401
I asked to see the accounts of CL Financial,

00:12:57.401 --> 00:12:59.873
and if you can't show me the accounts --

00:12:59.873 --> 00:13:01.838
the Minister of Finance is making statements,

00:13:01.838 --> 00:13:04.453
passing new laws and giving speeches and so on.

00:13:04.453 --> 00:13:06.744
What are the figures he's relying on?

00:13:06.744 --> 00:13:09.364
It's like that joke: I want whatever he's drinking.

00:13:09.364 --> 00:13:10.963
And they wrote back and said to me,

00:13:10.963 --> 00:13:12.674
well what do you really mean?

00:13:12.674 --> 00:13:15.065
So they hit my question with a question.

00:13:15.065 --> 00:13:18.186
Second point: I want to see

00:13:18.186 --> 00:13:21.885
who are the creditors of the group who have been repaid?

00:13:21.885 --> 00:13:23.889
Let me pause here to point out to you all

00:13:23.889 --> 00:13:27.570
that 24 billion dollars of our money has been spent on this.

00:13:27.570 --> 00:13:29.969
That is about three and a half billion U.S. dollars

00:13:29.969 --> 00:13:33.465
coming out of a small -- we used to be resource-rich --

00:13:33.465 --> 00:13:35.837
Caribbean country. Okay?

00:13:35.837 --> 00:13:37.385
And I asked the question,

00:13:37.385 --> 00:13:41.531
who was getting that three and a half billion dollars?

00:13:41.531 --> 00:13:43.788
And I want to pause again to bring up context,

00:13:43.788 --> 00:13:47.191
because context helps us to get clarity understanding this thing.

00:13:47.191 --> 00:13:49.761
There's a particular individual who is in the government now.

00:13:49.761 --> 00:13:51.481
The name of the person doesn't matter.

00:13:51.481 --> 00:13:54.033
And that person made a career

00:13:54.033 --> 00:13:56.394
out of using the Freedom of Information Act

00:13:56.394 --> 00:13:58.513
to advance his political cause.

00:13:58.513 --> 00:14:01.756
Okay? His name isn't important.

00:14:01.756 --> 00:14:04.089
I wouldn't dignify it. I'm on a point.

00:14:04.089 --> 00:14:06.509
The point is, that person made a career out of using

00:14:06.509 --> 00:14:09.473
the Freedom of Information Act to advance his cause.

00:14:09.473 --> 00:14:11.787
And the most famous case

00:14:11.787 --> 00:14:14.680
was what we came to call the Secret Scholarship Scandal,

00:14:14.680 --> 00:14:17.569
where in fact there was about 60 million dollars in government money

00:14:17.569 --> 00:14:20.441
that had been dispersed in a series of scholarships,

00:14:20.441 --> 00:14:23.165
and the scholarships hadn't been advertised, and so and so on and so on.

00:14:23.165 --> 00:14:26.156
And he was able to get the court, using that act of Parliament,

00:14:26.156 --> 00:14:27.789
Freedom of Information Act,

00:14:27.789 --> 00:14:29.766
to release the information,

00:14:29.766 --> 00:14:33.131
and I thought that was excellent.

00:14:33.131 --> 00:14:36.297
Fantastic.

00:14:36.297 --> 00:14:38.247
But you see, the question is this:

00:14:38.247 --> 00:14:42.460
If it's right and proper for us to use the Freedom of Information Act

00:14:42.460 --> 00:14:46.190
and to use the court

00:14:46.190 --> 00:14:50.932
to force a disclosure about 60 million dollars in public money,

00:14:50.932 --> 00:14:52.623
it must be right and proper

00:14:52.623 --> 00:14:56.764
for us to force a disclosure about 24 billion dollars.

00:14:56.764 --> 00:14:59.352
You see? But the Ministry of Finance,

00:14:59.352 --> 00:15:00.954
the Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Finance,

00:15:00.954 --> 00:15:04.011
wrote me and said to me, that information is exempt too.

00:15:04.011 --> 00:15:07.000
You see? This is what we're dealing with, okay?

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:09.134
The third thing I will tell you

00:15:09.134 --> 00:15:12.139
is that I also asked

00:15:12.139 --> 00:15:15.135
for the directors of CL Financial,

00:15:15.135 --> 00:15:19.480
whether in fact they were making filings under our Integrity in Public Life Act.

00:15:19.480 --> 00:15:21.098
We have an Integrity in Public Life Act

00:15:21.098 --> 00:15:25.847
as part of our framework supposed to safeguard the nation's interest.

00:15:25.847 --> 00:15:28.135
And public officials are supposed to file

00:15:28.135 --> 00:15:34.600
to say what it is they have in terms of assets and liabilities.

00:15:34.600 --> 00:15:37.015
And of course I've since discovered that they're not filing,

00:15:37.015 --> 00:15:39.894
and in fact the Minister of Finance has not even asked them to file.

00:15:39.894 --> 00:15:44.811
So here we have it. We have a situation where

00:15:44.811 --> 00:15:49.705
the basic safeguards of integrity and accountability

00:15:49.705 --> 00:15:51.698
and transparency have all been discarded.

00:15:51.698 --> 00:15:53.942
I've asked the question in the legal and required fashion.

00:15:53.942 --> 00:15:56.430
It's been ignored.

00:15:56.430 --> 00:15:59.605
The sort of thing that motivated us around Section 34,

00:15:59.605 --> 00:16:02.207
we need to continue to work on that. We can't forget it.

00:16:02.207 --> 00:16:05.805
I have defined this as the single largest expenditure in the country's history.

00:16:05.805 --> 00:16:08.386
It's also the single largest example

00:16:08.386 --> 00:16:13.398
of public corruption according to this equation.

00:16:13.398 --> 00:16:16.367
And this is my reality check.

00:16:16.367 --> 00:16:18.713
Where you have an expenditure of public money

00:16:18.713 --> 00:16:21.668
and it is without accountability

00:16:21.668 --> 00:16:23.308
and it's without transparency,

00:16:23.308 --> 00:16:25.564
it will always be equal to corruption,

00:16:25.564 --> 00:16:28.769
whether you're in Russia or Nigeria or Alaska,

00:16:28.769 --> 00:16:32.969
it will always be equal to corruption, and that is what we are dealing with here.

00:16:32.969 --> 00:16:35.280
I'm going to continue the work

00:16:35.280 --> 00:16:39.626
to press on, to get some resolution

00:16:39.626 --> 00:16:41.336
of those matters at the Ministry of Finance.

00:16:41.336 --> 00:16:43.888
If it is I have to go to court personally, I will do that.

00:16:43.888 --> 00:16:45.076
We will continue to press on.

00:16:45.076 --> 00:16:47.027
We will continue to work within JCC.

00:16:47.027 --> 00:16:49.728
But I want to step back from the Trinidad and Tobago context

00:16:49.728 --> 00:16:51.647
and bring something new to the table

00:16:51.647 --> 00:16:53.473
in terms of an international example.

00:16:53.473 --> 00:16:56.374
We had the journalist [Heather] Brooke speaking

00:16:56.374 --> 00:16:58.691
about her battle against government corruption,

00:16:58.691 --> 00:17:04.128
and she introduced me to this website, Alaveteli.com.

00:17:04.128 --> 00:17:08.798
And Alaveteli.com is a way for us to have an open database

00:17:08.798 --> 00:17:11.577
for Freedom of Information applications,

00:17:11.577 --> 00:17:13.693
and speak with each other.

00:17:13.693 --> 00:17:15.930
I could see what you're applying for.

00:17:15.930 --> 00:17:19.462
You could see what I applied for and what replies I got.

00:17:19.462 --> 00:17:22.398
We can work on it together. We need to build a collective database

00:17:22.398 --> 00:17:25.702
and a collective understanding of where we are to go to the next point.

00:17:25.702 --> 00:17:27.342
We need to increase the consciousness.

00:17:27.342 --> 00:17:31.396
The final thing I want to say is in relation to this one,

00:17:31.396 --> 00:17:33.174
which is a lovely website from India

00:17:33.174 --> 00:17:35.616
called IPaidABribe.com.

00:17:35.616 --> 00:17:37.402
They have international branches,

00:17:37.402 --> 00:17:39.846
and it's important for us to tune into this one.

00:17:39.846 --> 00:17:42.302
IPaidABribe.com is really important,

00:17:42.302 --> 00:17:44.718
a good one to log on to and see.

00:17:44.718 --> 00:17:47.345
I'm going to pause there. I'm going to ask you for your courage.

00:17:47.345 --> 00:17:49.566
Discard the first myth; it is a crime.

00:17:49.566 --> 00:17:51.884
Discard the second myth; it is a big thing.

00:17:51.884 --> 00:17:54.382
It's a huge problem. It's an economic crime.

00:17:54.382 --> 00:17:56.430
And let us continue working together

00:17:56.430 --> 00:17:57.897
to betterment in this situation,

00:17:57.897 --> 00:18:01.707
stability and sustainability in our society. Thank you.
