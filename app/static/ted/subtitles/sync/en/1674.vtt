00:00:12.695 --> 00:00:16.227
I grew up watching Star Trek. I love Star Trek.

00:00:16.227 --> 00:00:20.689
Star Trek made me want to see alien creatures,

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:22.992
creatures from a far-distant world.

00:00:22.992 --> 00:00:25.779
But basically, I figured out that I could find

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:28.756
those alien creatures right on Earth.

00:00:28.756 --> 00:00:31.409
And what I do is I study insects.

00:00:31.409 --> 00:00:34.665
I'm obsessed with insects, particularly insect flight.

00:00:34.665 --> 00:00:37.806
I think the evolution of insect flight is perhaps

00:00:37.806 --> 00:00:40.548
one of the most important events in the history of life.

00:00:40.548 --> 00:00:42.785
Without insects, there'd be no flowering plants.

00:00:42.785 --> 00:00:44.701
Without flowering plants, there would be no

00:00:44.701 --> 00:00:47.838
clever, fruit-eating primates giving TED Talks.

00:00:47.838 --> 00:00:50.138
(Laughter)

00:00:50.138 --> 00:00:52.125
Now,

00:00:52.125 --> 00:00:55.164
David and Hidehiko and Ketaki

00:00:55.164 --> 00:00:58.609
gave a very compelling story about

00:00:58.609 --> 00:01:01.414
the similarities between fruit flies and humans,

00:01:01.414 --> 00:01:02.903
and there are many similarities,

00:01:02.903 --> 00:01:05.905
and so you might think that if humans are similar to fruit flies,

00:01:05.905 --> 00:01:09.702
the favorite behavior of a fruit fly might be this, for example --

00:01:09.702 --> 00:01:11.984
(Laughter)

00:01:11.984 --> 00:01:15.175
but in my talk, I don't want to emphasize on the similarities

00:01:15.175 --> 00:01:18.242
between humans and fruit flies, but rather the differences,

00:01:18.242 --> 00:01:23.529
and focus on the behaviors that I think fruit flies excel at doing.

00:01:23.529 --> 00:01:26.385
And so I want to show you a high-speed video sequence

00:01:26.385 --> 00:01:30.320
of a fly shot at 7,000 frames per second in infrared lighting,

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:34.530
and to the right, off-screen, is an electronic looming predator

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:35.965
that is going to go at the fly.

00:01:35.965 --> 00:01:37.803
The fly is going to sense this predator.

00:01:37.803 --> 00:01:40.258
It is going to extend its legs out.

00:01:40.258 --> 00:01:41.871
It's going to sashay away

00:01:41.871 --> 00:01:44.436
to live to fly another day.

00:01:44.436 --> 00:01:46.798
Now I have carefully cropped this sequence

00:01:46.798 --> 00:01:49.958
to be exactly the duration of a human eye blink,

00:01:49.958 --> 00:01:52.792
so in the time that it would take you to blink your eye,

00:01:52.792 --> 00:01:56.057
the fly has seen this looming predator,

00:01:56.057 --> 00:02:02.225
estimated its position, initiated a motor pattern to fly it away,

00:02:02.225 --> 00:02:06.689
beating its wings at 220 times a second as it does so.

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:08.662
I think this is a fascinating behavior

00:02:08.662 --> 00:02:12.583
that shows how fast the fly's brain can process information.

00:02:12.583 --> 00:02:15.425
Now, flight -- what does it take to fly?

00:02:15.425 --> 00:02:18.289
Well, in order to fly, just as in a human aircraft,

00:02:18.289 --> 00:02:21.024
you need wings that can generate sufficient aerodynamic forces,

00:02:21.024 --> 00:02:24.570
you need an engine sufficient to generate the power required for flight,

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:26.279
and you need a controller,

00:02:26.279 --> 00:02:28.905
and in the first human aircraft, the controller was basically

00:02:28.905 --> 00:02:33.217
the brain of Orville and Wilbur sitting in the cockpit.

00:02:33.217 --> 00:02:35.970
Now, how does this compare to a fly?

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:39.221
Well, I spent a lot of my early career trying to figure out

00:02:39.221 --> 00:02:43.557
how insect wings generate enough force to keep the flies in the air.

00:02:43.557 --> 00:02:45.167
And you might have heard how engineers proved

00:02:45.167 --> 00:02:47.801
that bumblebees couldn't fly.

00:02:47.801 --> 00:02:50.421
Well, the problem was in thinking that the insect wings

00:02:50.421 --> 00:02:53.540
function in the way that aircraft wings work. But they don't.

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:56.394
And we tackle this problem by building giant,

00:02:56.394 --> 00:02:59.826
dynamically scaled model robot insects

00:02:59.826 --> 00:03:03.162
that would flap in giant pools of mineral oil

00:03:03.162 --> 00:03:05.436
where we could study the aerodynamic forces.

00:03:05.436 --> 00:03:07.594
And it turns out that the insects flap their wings

00:03:07.594 --> 00:03:10.186
in a very clever way, at a very high angle of attack

00:03:10.186 --> 00:03:13.307
that creates a structure at the leading edge of the wing,

00:03:13.307 --> 00:03:16.506
a little tornado-like structure called a leading edge vortex,

00:03:16.506 --> 00:03:19.460
and it's that vortex that actually enables the wings

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:22.819
to make enough force for the animal to stay in the air.

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:25.247
But the thing that's actually most -- so, what's fascinating

00:03:25.247 --> 00:03:28.222
is not so much that the wing has some interesting morphology.

00:03:28.222 --> 00:03:31.867
What's clever is the way the fly flaps it,

00:03:31.867 --> 00:03:35.003
which of course ultimately is controlled by the nervous system,

00:03:35.003 --> 00:03:37.650
and this is what enables flies to perform

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:40.457
these remarkable aerial maneuvers.

00:03:40.457 --> 00:03:42.554
Now, what about the engine?

00:03:42.554 --> 00:03:45.046
The engine of the fly is absolutely fascinating.

00:03:45.046 --> 00:03:46.944
They have two types of flight muscle:

00:03:46.944 --> 00:03:49.929
so-called power muscle, which is stretch-activated,

00:03:49.929 --> 00:03:53.655
which means that it activates itself and does not need to be controlled

00:03:53.655 --> 00:03:56.994
on a contraction-by-contraction basis by the nervous system.

00:03:56.994 --> 00:04:01.603
It's specialized to generate the enormous power required for flight,

00:04:01.603 --> 00:04:03.682
and it fills the middle portion of the fly,

00:04:03.682 --> 00:04:05.229
so when a fly hits your windshield,

00:04:05.229 --> 00:04:07.635
it's basically the power muscle that you're looking at.

00:04:07.635 --> 00:04:09.781
But attached to the base of the wing

00:04:09.781 --> 00:04:12.419
is a set of little, tiny control muscles

00:04:12.419 --> 00:04:15.720
that are not very powerful at all, but they're very fast,

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:18.926
and they're able to reconfigure the hinge of the wing

00:04:18.926 --> 00:04:20.688
on a stroke-by-stroke basis,

00:04:20.688 --> 00:04:23.830
and this is what enables the fly to change its wing

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:26.801
and generate the changes in aerodynamic forces

00:04:26.801 --> 00:04:29.374
which change its flight trajectory.

00:04:29.374 --> 00:04:32.937
And of course, the role of the nervous system is to control all this.

00:04:32.937 --> 00:04:34.449
So let's look at the controller.

00:04:34.449 --> 00:04:37.096
Now flies excel in the sorts of sensors

00:04:37.096 --> 00:04:39.380
that they carry to this problem.

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:43.507
They have antennae that sense odors and detect wind detection.

00:04:43.507 --> 00:04:45.182
They have a sophisticated eye which is

00:04:45.182 --> 00:04:47.638
the fastest visual system on the planet.

00:04:47.638 --> 00:04:49.674
They have another set of eyes on the top of their head.

00:04:49.674 --> 00:04:51.726
We have no idea what they do.

00:04:51.726 --> 00:04:54.680
They have sensors on their wing.

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:58.440
Their wing is covered with sensors, including sensors

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:00.486
that sense deformation of the wing.

00:05:00.486 --> 00:05:02.595
They can even taste with their wings.

00:05:02.595 --> 00:05:05.150
One of the most sophisticated sensors a fly has

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:06.957
is a structure called the halteres.

00:05:06.957 --> 00:05:08.836
The halteres are actually gyroscopes.

00:05:08.836 --> 00:05:13.285
These devices beat back and forth about 200 hertz during flight,

00:05:13.285 --> 00:05:15.958
and the animal can use them to sense its body rotation

00:05:15.958 --> 00:05:19.926
and initiate very, very fast corrective maneuvers.

00:05:19.926 --> 00:05:22.255
But all of this sensory information has to be processed

00:05:22.255 --> 00:05:25.975
by a brain, and yes, indeed, flies have a brain,

00:05:25.975 --> 00:05:29.134
a brain of about 100,000 neurons.

00:05:29.134 --> 00:05:31.327
Now several people at this conference

00:05:31.327 --> 00:05:36.135
have already suggested that fruit flies could serve neuroscience

00:05:36.135 --> 00:05:39.382
because they're a simple model of brain function.

00:05:39.382 --> 00:05:41.459
And the basic punchline of my talk is,

00:05:41.459 --> 00:05:44.117
I'd like to turn that over on its head.

00:05:44.117 --> 00:05:46.745
I don't think they're a simple model of anything.

00:05:46.745 --> 00:05:49.222
And I think that flies are a great model.

00:05:49.222 --> 00:05:51.738
They're a great model for flies.

00:05:51.738 --> 00:05:54.219
(Laughter)

00:05:54.219 --> 00:05:57.222
And let's explore this notion of simplicity.

00:05:57.222 --> 00:05:59.653
So I think, unfortunately, a lot of neuroscientists,

00:05:59.653 --> 00:06:01.485
we're all somewhat narcissistic.

00:06:01.485 --> 00:06:04.918
When we think of brain, we of course imagine our own brain.

00:06:04.918 --> 00:06:06.878
But remember that this kind of brain,

00:06:06.878 --> 00:06:08.646
which is much, much smaller

00:06:08.646 --> 00:06:11.324
— instead of 100 billion neurons, it has 100,000 neurons —

00:06:11.324 --> 00:06:14.206
but this is the most common form of brain on the planet

00:06:14.206 --> 00:06:17.110
and has been for 400 million years.

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:19.398
And is it fair to say that it's simple?

00:06:19.398 --> 00:06:21.493
Well, it's simple in the sense that it has fewer neurons,

00:06:21.493 --> 00:06:23.247
but is that a fair metric?

00:06:23.247 --> 00:06:25.523
And I would propose it's not a fair metric.

00:06:25.523 --> 00:06:28.623
So let's sort of think about this. I think we have to compare --

00:06:28.623 --> 00:06:30.182
(Laughter) —

00:06:30.182 --> 00:06:35.303
we have to compare the size of the brain

00:06:35.303 --> 00:06:37.333
with what the brain can do.

00:06:37.333 --> 00:06:40.214
So I propose we have a Trump number,

00:06:40.214 --> 00:06:43.079
and the Trump number is the ratio of this man's

00:06:43.079 --> 00:06:46.758
behavioral repertoire to the number of neurons in his brain.

00:06:46.758 --> 00:06:49.426
We'll calculate the Trump number for the fruit fly.

00:06:49.426 --> 00:06:52.110
Now, how many people here think the Trump number

00:06:52.110 --> 00:06:54.599
is higher for the fruit fly?

00:06:54.599 --> 00:06:57.030
(Applause)

00:06:57.030 --> 00:07:00.458
It's a very smart, smart audience.

00:07:00.458 --> 00:07:03.785
Yes, the inequality goes in this direction, or I would posit it.

00:07:03.785 --> 00:07:06.167
Now I realize that it is a little bit absurd

00:07:06.167 --> 00:07:09.725
to compare the behavioral repertoire of a human to a fly.

00:07:09.725 --> 00:07:13.868
But let's take another animal just as an example. Here's a mouse.

00:07:13.868 --> 00:07:18.173
A mouse has about 1,000 times as many neurons as a fly.

00:07:18.173 --> 00:07:20.200
I used to study mice. When I studied mice,

00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:23.037
I used to talk really slowly.

00:07:23.037 --> 00:07:25.613
And then something happened when I started to work on flies.

00:07:25.613 --> 00:07:28.025
(Laughter)

00:07:28.025 --> 00:07:31.485
And I think if you compare the natural history of flies and mice,

00:07:31.485 --> 00:07:34.798
it's really comparable. They have to forage for food.

00:07:34.798 --> 00:07:37.245
They have to engage in courtship.

00:07:37.245 --> 00:07:40.716
They have sex. They hide from predators.

00:07:40.716 --> 00:07:42.696
They do a lot of the similar things.

00:07:42.696 --> 00:07:44.414
But I would argue that flies do more.

00:07:44.414 --> 00:07:47.792
So for example, I'm going to show you a sequence,

00:07:47.792 --> 00:07:51.997
and I have to say, some of my funding comes from the military,

00:07:51.997 --> 00:07:54.069
so I'm showing this classified sequence

00:07:54.069 --> 00:07:58.162
and you cannot discuss it outside of this room. Okay?

00:07:58.162 --> 00:08:00.070
So I want you to look at the payload

00:08:00.070 --> 00:08:03.096
at the tail of the fruit fly.

00:08:03.096 --> 00:08:05.197
Watch it very closely,

00:08:05.197 --> 00:08:09.494
and you'll see why my six-year-old son

00:08:09.494 --> 00:08:14.223
now wants to be a neuroscientist.

00:08:14.223 --> 00:08:15.402
Wait for it.

00:08:15.402 --> 00:08:16.971
Pshhew.

00:08:16.971 --> 00:08:20.055
So at least you'll admit that if fruit flies are not as clever as mice,

00:08:20.055 --> 00:08:24.971
they're at least as clever as pigeons. (Laughter)

00:08:24.971 --> 00:08:28.938
Now, I want to get across that it's not just a matter of numbers

00:08:28.938 --> 00:08:31.536
but also the challenge for a fly to compute

00:08:31.536 --> 00:08:34.385
everything its brain has to compute with such tiny neurons.

00:08:34.385 --> 00:08:37.373
So this is a beautiful image of a visual interneuron from a mouse

00:08:37.373 --> 00:08:40.141
that came from Jeff Lichtman's lab,

00:08:40.141 --> 00:08:43.388
and you can see the wonderful images of brains

00:08:43.388 --> 00:08:46.581
that he showed in his talk.

00:08:46.581 --> 00:08:48.949
But up in the corner, in the right corner, you'll see,

00:08:48.949 --> 00:08:53.061
at the same scale, a visual interneuron from a fly.

00:08:53.061 --> 00:08:54.902
And I'll expand this up.

00:08:54.902 --> 00:08:57.072
And it's a beautifully complex neuron.

00:08:57.072 --> 00:09:00.557
It's just very, very tiny, and there's lots of biophysical challenges

00:09:00.557 --> 00:09:04.180
with trying to compute information with tiny, tiny neurons.

00:09:04.180 --> 00:09:07.717
How small can neurons get? Well, look at this interesting insect.

00:09:07.717 --> 00:09:09.929
It looks sort of like a fly. It has wings, it has eyes,

00:09:09.929 --> 00:09:12.728
it has antennae, its legs, complicated life history,

00:09:12.728 --> 00:09:15.824
it's a parasite, it has to fly around and find caterpillars

00:09:15.824 --> 00:09:17.206
to parasatize,

00:09:17.206 --> 00:09:21.321
but not only is its brain the size of a salt grain,

00:09:21.321 --> 00:09:23.290
which is comparable for a fruit fly,

00:09:23.290 --> 00:09:26.216
it is the size of a salt grain.

00:09:26.216 --> 00:09:29.851
So here's some other organisms at the similar scale.

00:09:29.851 --> 00:09:33.981
This animal is the size of a paramecium and an amoeba,

00:09:33.981 --> 00:09:37.861
and it has a brain of 7,000 neurons that's so small --

00:09:37.861 --> 00:09:40.317
you know these things called cell bodies you've been hearing about,

00:09:40.317 --> 00:09:41.968
where the nucleus of the neuron is?

00:09:41.968 --> 00:09:45.428
This animal gets rid of them because they take up too much space.

00:09:45.428 --> 00:09:47.901
So this is a session on frontiers in neuroscience.

00:09:47.901 --> 00:09:53.261
I would posit that one frontier in neuroscience is to figure out how the brain of that thing works.

00:09:53.261 --> 00:09:58.894
But let's think about this. How can you make a small number of neurons do a lot?

00:09:58.894 --> 00:10:01.416
And I think, from an engineering perspective,

00:10:01.416 --> 00:10:03.145
you think of multiplexing.

00:10:03.145 --> 00:10:05.848
You can take a hardware and have that hardware

00:10:05.848 --> 00:10:07.461
do different things at different times,

00:10:07.461 --> 00:10:10.456
or have different parts of the hardware doing different things.

00:10:10.456 --> 00:10:13.727
And these are the two concepts I'd like to explore.

00:10:13.727 --> 00:10:15.385
And they're not concepts that I've come up with,

00:10:15.385 --> 00:10:19.930
but concepts that have been proposed by others in the past.

00:10:19.930 --> 00:10:23.005
And one idea comes from lessons from chewing crabs.

00:10:23.005 --> 00:10:24.872
And I don't mean chewing the crabs.

00:10:24.872 --> 00:10:28.471
I grew up in Baltimore, and I chew crabs very, very well.

00:10:28.471 --> 00:10:31.328
But I'm talking about the crabs actually doing the chewing.

00:10:31.328 --> 00:10:33.358
Crab chewing is actually really fascinating.

00:10:33.358 --> 00:10:36.617
Crabs have this complicated structure under their carapace

00:10:36.617 --> 00:10:37.927
called the gastric mill

00:10:37.927 --> 00:10:40.357
that grinds their food in a variety of different ways.

00:10:40.357 --> 00:10:45.616
And here's an endoscopic movie of this structure.

00:10:45.616 --> 00:10:48.176
The amazing thing about this is that it's controlled

00:10:48.176 --> 00:10:51.608
by a really tiny set of neurons, about two dozen neurons

00:10:51.608 --> 00:10:56.571
that can produce a vast variety of different motor patterns,

00:10:56.571 --> 00:11:00.918
and the reason it can do this is that this little tiny ganglion

00:11:00.918 --> 00:11:05.102
in the crab is actually inundated by many, many neuromodulators.

00:11:05.102 --> 00:11:07.243
You heard about neuromodulators earlier.

00:11:07.243 --> 00:11:09.468
There are more neuromodulators

00:11:09.468 --> 00:11:14.953
that alter, that innervate this structure than actually neurons in the structure,

00:11:14.953 --> 00:11:19.195
and they're able to generate a complicated set of patterns.

00:11:19.195 --> 00:11:22.636
And this is the work by Eve Marder and her many colleagues

00:11:22.636 --> 00:11:24.931
who've been studying this fascinating system

00:11:24.931 --> 00:11:27.083
that show how a smaller cluster of neurons

00:11:27.083 --> 00:11:28.908
can do many, many, many things

00:11:28.908 --> 00:11:33.764
because of neuromodulation that can take place on a moment-by-moment basis.

00:11:33.764 --> 00:11:36.203
So this is basically multiplexing in time.

00:11:36.203 --> 00:11:38.988
Imagine a network of neurons with one neuromodulator.

00:11:38.988 --> 00:11:42.466
You select one set of cells to perform one sort of behavior,

00:11:42.466 --> 00:11:45.084
another neuromodulator, another set of cells,

00:11:45.084 --> 00:11:46.797
a different pattern, and you can imagine

00:11:46.797 --> 00:11:50.675
you could extrapolate to a very, very complicated system.

00:11:50.675 --> 00:11:52.769
Is there any evidence that flies do this?

00:11:52.769 --> 00:11:56.144
Well, for many years in my laboratory and other laboratories around the world,

00:11:56.144 --> 00:11:58.792
we've been studying fly behaviors in little flight simulators.

00:11:58.792 --> 00:12:00.498
You can tether a fly to a little stick.

00:12:00.498 --> 00:12:02.999
You can measure the aerodynamic forces it's creating.

00:12:02.999 --> 00:12:05.545
You can let the fly play a little video game

00:12:05.545 --> 00:12:09.423
by letting it fly around in a visual display.

00:12:09.423 --> 00:12:11.760
So let me show you a little tiny sequence of this.

00:12:11.760 --> 00:12:12.987
Here's a fly

00:12:12.987 --> 00:12:16.424
and a large infrared view of the fly in the flight simulator,

00:12:16.424 --> 00:12:18.379
and this is a game the flies love to play.

00:12:18.379 --> 00:12:20.816
You allow them to steer towards the little stripe,

00:12:20.816 --> 00:12:23.641
and they'll just steer towards that stripe forever.

00:12:23.641 --> 00:12:27.199
It's part of their visual guidance system.

00:12:27.199 --> 00:12:29.544
But very, very recently, it's been possible

00:12:29.544 --> 00:12:34.484
to modify these sorts of behavioral arenas for physiologies.

00:12:34.484 --> 00:12:36.972
So this is the preparation that one of my former post-docs,

00:12:36.972 --> 00:12:39.415
Gaby Maimon, who's now at Rockefeller, developed,

00:12:39.415 --> 00:12:41.101
and it's basically a flight simulator

00:12:41.101 --> 00:12:44.176
but under conditions where you actually can stick an electrode

00:12:44.176 --> 00:12:46.440
in the brain of the fly and record

00:12:46.440 --> 00:12:50.096
from a genetically identified neuron in the fly's brain.

00:12:50.096 --> 00:12:52.394
And this is what one of these experiments looks like.

00:12:52.394 --> 00:12:55.365
It was a sequence taken from another post-doc in the lab,

00:12:55.365 --> 00:12:56.564
Bettina Schnell.

00:12:56.564 --> 00:12:59.956
The green trace at the bottom is the membrane potential

00:12:59.956 --> 00:13:01.986
of a neuron in the fly's brain,

00:13:01.986 --> 00:13:04.928
and you'll see the fly start to fly, and the fly is actually

00:13:04.928 --> 00:13:08.207
controlling the rotation of that visual pattern itself

00:13:08.207 --> 00:13:09.686
by its own wing motion,

00:13:09.686 --> 00:13:11.796
and you can see this visual interneuron

00:13:11.796 --> 00:13:15.704
respond to the pattern of wing motion as the fly flies.

00:13:15.704 --> 00:13:18.080
So for the first time we've actually been able to record

00:13:18.080 --> 00:13:20.988
from neurons in the fly's brain while the fly

00:13:20.988 --> 00:13:25.456
is performing sophisticated behaviors such as flight.

00:13:25.456 --> 00:13:27.311
And one of the lessons we've been learning

00:13:27.311 --> 00:13:29.731
is that the physiology of cells that we've been studying

00:13:29.731 --> 00:13:32.152
for many years in quiescent flies

00:13:32.152 --> 00:13:34.800
is not the same as the physiology of those cells

00:13:34.800 --> 00:13:37.536
when the flies actually engage in active behaviors

00:13:37.536 --> 00:13:40.075
like flying and walking and so forth.

00:13:40.075 --> 00:13:43.000
And why is the physiology different?

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:45.057
Well it turns out it's these neuromodulators,

00:13:45.057 --> 00:13:49.008
just like the neuromodulators in that little tiny ganglion in the crabs.

00:13:49.008 --> 00:13:51.558
So here's a picture of the octopamine system.

00:13:51.558 --> 00:13:53.312
Octopamine is a neuromodulator

00:13:53.312 --> 00:13:57.648
that seems to play an important role in flight and other behaviors.

00:13:57.648 --> 00:14:00.120
But this is just one of many neuromodulators

00:14:00.120 --> 00:14:01.191
that's in the fly's brain.

00:14:01.191 --> 00:14:03.857
So I really think that, as we learn more,

00:14:03.857 --> 00:14:06.384
it's going to turn out that the whole fly brain

00:14:06.384 --> 00:14:09.473
is just like a large version of this stomatogastric ganglion,

00:14:09.473 --> 00:14:13.833
and that's one of the reasons why it can do so much with so few neurons.

00:14:13.833 --> 00:14:16.620
Now, another idea, another way of multiplexing

00:14:16.620 --> 00:14:18.276
is multiplexing in space,

00:14:18.276 --> 00:14:19.970
having different parts of a neuron

00:14:19.970 --> 00:14:22.092
do different things at the same time.

00:14:22.092 --> 00:14:23.925
So here's two sort of canonical neurons

00:14:23.925 --> 00:14:26.210
from a vertebrate and an invertebrate,

00:14:26.210 --> 00:14:29.460
a human pyramidal neuron from Ramon y Cajal,

00:14:29.460 --> 00:14:33.463
and another cell to the right, a non-spiking interneuron,

00:14:33.463 --> 00:14:37.610
and this is the work of Alan Watson and Malcolm Burrows many years ago,

00:14:37.610 --> 00:14:40.685
and Malcolm Burrows came up with a pretty interesting idea

00:14:40.685 --> 00:14:43.567
based on the fact that this neuron from a locust

00:14:43.567 --> 00:14:45.526
does not fire action potentials.

00:14:45.526 --> 00:14:47.274
It's a non-spiking cell.

00:14:47.274 --> 00:14:50.054
So a typical cell, like the neurons in our brain,

00:14:50.054 --> 00:14:52.806
has a region called the dendrites that receives input,

00:14:52.806 --> 00:14:55.395
and that input sums together

00:14:55.395 --> 00:14:57.691
and will produce action potentials

00:14:57.691 --> 00:15:00.022
that run down the axon and then activate

00:15:00.022 --> 00:15:02.318
all the output regions of the neuron.

00:15:02.318 --> 00:15:05.194
But non-spiking neurons are actually quite complicated

00:15:05.194 --> 00:15:08.306
because they can have input synapses and output synapses

00:15:08.306 --> 00:15:11.969
all interdigitated, and there's no single action potential

00:15:11.969 --> 00:15:15.095
that drives all the outputs at the same time.

00:15:15.095 --> 00:15:19.002
So there's a possibility that you have computational compartments

00:15:19.002 --> 00:15:22.980
that allow the different parts of the neuron

00:15:22.980 --> 00:15:25.540
to do different things at the same time.

00:15:25.540 --> 00:15:30.211
So these basic concepts of multitasking in time

00:15:30.211 --> 00:15:32.572
and multitasking in space,

00:15:32.572 --> 00:15:35.404
I think these are things that are true in our brains as well,

00:15:35.404 --> 00:15:37.981
but I think the insects are the true masters of this.

00:15:37.981 --> 00:15:41.097
So I hope you think of insects a little bit differently next time,

00:15:41.097 --> 00:15:44.032
and as I say up here, please think before you swat.

00:15:44.032 --> 00:15:46.985
(Applause)
