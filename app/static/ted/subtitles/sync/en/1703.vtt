00:00:12.539 --> 00:00:15.779
This is the Natural History Museum in Rotterdam,

00:00:15.779 --> 00:00:18.339
where I work as a curator.

00:00:18.339 --> 00:00:21.387
It's my job to make sure the collection stays okay,

00:00:21.387 --> 00:00:23.363
and that it grows,

00:00:23.363 --> 00:00:28.715
and basically it means I collect dead animals.

00:00:28.715 --> 00:00:31.106
Back in 1995,

00:00:31.106 --> 00:00:35.602
we got a new wing next to the museum.

00:00:35.602 --> 00:00:37.743
It was made of glass,

00:00:37.743 --> 00:00:43.249
and this building really helped me to do my job good.

00:00:43.249 --> 00:00:47.375
The building was a true bird-killer.

00:00:47.375 --> 00:00:49.953
You may know that birds don't understand

00:00:49.953 --> 00:00:53.115
the concept of glass. They don't see it,

00:00:53.115 --> 00:00:56.721
so they fly into the windows and get killed.

00:00:56.721 --> 00:00:58.961
The only thing I had to do was go out,

00:00:58.961 --> 00:01:03.018
pick them up, and have them stuffed for the collection.

00:01:03.018 --> 00:01:06.136
(Laughter)

00:01:06.136 --> 00:01:07.915
And in those days,

00:01:07.915 --> 00:01:11.353
I developed an ear to identify birds

00:01:11.353 --> 00:01:16.939
just by the sound of the bangs they made against the glass.

00:01:16.939 --> 00:01:20.921
And it was on June 5, 1995,

00:01:20.921 --> 00:01:24.687
that I heard a loud bang against the glass

00:01:24.687 --> 00:01:29.297
that changed my life and ended that of a duck.

00:01:29.297 --> 00:01:35.092
And this is what I saw when I looked out of the window.

00:01:35.092 --> 00:01:38.276
This is the dead duck. It flew against the window.

00:01:38.276 --> 00:01:39.970
It's laying dead on its belly.

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:43.325
But next to the dead duck is a live duck,

00:01:43.325 --> 00:01:45.639
and please pay attention.

00:01:45.639 --> 00:01:49.129
Both are of the male sex.

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:53.233
And then this happened.

00:01:53.233 --> 00:01:55.939
The live duck mounted the dead duck,

00:01:55.939 --> 00:01:58.602
and started to copulate.

00:01:58.602 --> 00:02:01.327
Well, I'm a biologist. I'm an ornithologist.

00:02:01.327 --> 00:02:04.075
I said, "Something's wrong here."

00:02:04.075 --> 00:02:10.047
One is dead, one is alive. That must be necrophilia.

00:02:10.047 --> 00:02:12.929
I look. Both are of the male sex.

00:02:12.929 --> 00:02:17.568
Homosexual necrophilia.

00:02:17.568 --> 00:02:22.613
So I -- (Laughter)

00:02:22.613 --> 00:02:25.557
I took my camera, I took my notebook,

00:02:25.557 --> 00:02:30.968
took a chair, and started to observe this behavior.

00:02:30.968 --> 00:02:36.585
After 75 minutes — (Laughter) —

00:02:36.585 --> 00:02:41.394
I had seen enough, and I got hungry,

00:02:41.394 --> 00:02:44.033
and I wanted to go home.

00:02:44.033 --> 00:02:47.593
So I went out, collected the duck,

00:02:47.593 --> 00:02:49.549
and before I put it in the freezer,

00:02:49.549 --> 00:02:54.425
I checked if the victim was indeed of the male sex.

00:02:54.425 --> 00:02:58.033
And here's a rare picture of a duck's penis,

00:02:58.033 --> 00:03:01.074
so it was indeed of the male sex.

00:03:01.074 --> 00:03:04.369
It's a rare picture because there are 10,000 species of birds

00:03:04.369 --> 00:03:08.960
and only 300 possess a penis.

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:11.347
[The first case of homosexual necrophilia in the mallard Anas platyrhynchos (Aves:Anatidae)]

00:03:11.347 --> 00:03:15.281
I knew I'd seen something special,

00:03:15.281 --> 00:03:20.703
but it took me six years to decide to publish it.

00:03:20.703 --> 00:03:23.558
(Laughter)

00:03:23.558 --> 00:03:27.089
I mean, it's a nice topic for a birthday party

00:03:27.089 --> 00:03:28.828
or at the coffee machine,

00:03:28.828 --> 00:03:32.138
but to share this among your peers is something different.

00:03:32.138 --> 00:03:33.956
I didn't have the framework.

00:03:33.956 --> 00:03:37.001
So after six years, my friends and colleagues urged me to publish,

00:03:37.001 --> 00:03:40.305
so I published "The first case of homosexual necrophilia

00:03:40.305 --> 00:03:41.900
in the mallard."

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:44.449
And here's the situation again.

00:03:44.449 --> 00:03:47.001
A is my office,

00:03:47.001 --> 00:03:49.465
B is the place where the duck hit the glass,

00:03:49.465 --> 00:03:52.523
and C is from where I watched it.

00:03:52.523 --> 00:03:55.220
And here are the ducks again.

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:57.227
As you probably know, in science,

00:03:57.227 --> 00:03:59.410
when you write a kind of special paper,

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:02.409
only six or seven people read it.

00:04:02.409 --> 00:04:07.134
(Laughter)

00:04:08.994 --> 00:04:11.594
But then something good happened.

00:04:11.594 --> 00:04:16.102
I got a phone call from a person called Marc Abrahams,

00:04:16.102 --> 00:04:20.955
and he told me, "You've won a prize with your duck paper:

00:04:20.955 --> 00:04:24.638
the Ig Nobel Prize."

00:04:24.638 --> 00:04:26.552
And the Ig Nobel Prize —

00:04:26.552 --> 00:04:30.969
(Laughter) (Applause) —

00:04:30.969 --> 00:04:32.988
the Ig Nobel Prize honors research

00:04:32.988 --> 00:04:36.065
that first makes people laugh, and then makes them think,

00:04:36.065 --> 00:04:38.849
with the ultimate goal to make more people

00:04:38.849 --> 00:04:41.913
interested in science.

00:04:41.913 --> 00:04:46.049
That's a good thing, so I accepted the prize.

00:04:46.049 --> 00:04:48.738
(Laughter)

00:04:48.738 --> 00:04:52.494
I went -- let me remind you that Marc Abrahams

00:04:52.494 --> 00:04:54.067
didn't call me from Stockholm.

00:04:54.067 --> 00:04:56.220
He called me from Cambridge, Massachusetts.

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:59.167
So I traveled to Boston, to Cambridge,

00:04:59.167 --> 00:05:02.622
and I went to this wonderful Ig Nobel Prize ceremony

00:05:02.622 --> 00:05:04.975
held at Harvard University, and this ceremony

00:05:04.975 --> 00:05:10.215
is a very nice experience.

00:05:10.215 --> 00:05:13.496
Real Nobel laureates hand you the prize.

00:05:13.496 --> 00:05:14.909
That's the first thing.

00:05:14.909 --> 00:05:17.943
And there are nine other winners who get prizes.

00:05:17.943 --> 00:05:21.319
Here's one of my fellow winners. That's Charles Paxton

00:05:21.319 --> 00:05:26.380
who won the 2000 biology prize for his paper,

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:30.359
"Courtship behavior of ostriches towards humans

00:05:30.359 --> 00:05:32.795
under farming conditions in Britain."

00:05:32.795 --> 00:05:37.075
(Laughter)

00:05:37.075 --> 00:05:40.231
And I think there are one or two more

00:05:40.231 --> 00:05:43.152
Ig Nobel Prize winners in this room.

00:05:43.152 --> 00:05:46.879
Dan, where are you? Dan Ariely?

00:05:46.879 --> 00:05:48.801
Applause for Dan.

00:05:48.801 --> 00:05:52.103
(Applause)

00:05:52.103 --> 00:05:55.847
Dan won his prize in medicine

00:05:55.847 --> 00:06:00.022
for demonstrating that high-priced fake medicine

00:06:00.022 --> 00:06:02.879
works better than low-priced fake medicine.

00:06:02.879 --> 00:06:07.150
(Laughter)

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:09.968
So here's my one minute of fame,

00:06:09.968 --> 00:06:14.445
my acceptance speech,

00:06:14.445 --> 00:06:16.658
and here's the duck.

00:06:16.658 --> 00:06:21.580
This is its first time on the U.S. West Coast.

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:24.254
I'm going to pass it around.

00:06:24.254 --> 00:06:29.543
(Laughter)

00:06:29.543 --> 00:06:31.020
Yeah?

00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:32.329
You can pass it around.

00:06:32.329 --> 00:06:34.710
Please note it's a museum specimen,

00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:40.128
but there's no chance you'll get the avian flu.

00:06:40.128 --> 00:06:44.134
After winning this prize, my life changed.

00:06:44.134 --> 00:06:46.264
In the first place, people started to send me

00:06:46.264 --> 00:06:49.811
all kinds of duck-related things,

00:06:49.811 --> 00:06:52.863
and I got a real nice collection.

00:06:52.863 --> 00:06:55.190
(Laughter)

00:06:55.190 --> 00:07:01.854
More importantly,

00:07:01.854 --> 00:07:05.926
people started to send me their observations

00:07:05.926 --> 00:07:08.460
of remarkable animal behavior,

00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:11.632
and believe me, if there's an animal misbehaving on this planet,

00:07:11.632 --> 00:07:13.333
I know about it.

00:07:13.333 --> 00:07:17.681
(Laughter)

00:07:17.681 --> 00:07:22.463
This is a moose.

00:07:22.463 --> 00:07:23.990
It's a moose trying to copulate

00:07:23.990 --> 00:07:27.479
with a bronze statue of a bison.

00:07:27.479 --> 00:07:31.272
This is in Montana, 2008.

00:07:31.272 --> 00:07:35.352
This is a frog that tries to copulate with a goldfish.

00:07:35.352 --> 00:07:38.583
This is the Netherlands, 2011.

00:07:38.583 --> 00:07:42.859
These are cane toads in Australia.

00:07:42.859 --> 00:07:44.114
This is roadkill.

00:07:44.114 --> 00:07:47.358
Please note that this is necrophilia.

00:07:47.358 --> 00:07:49.066
It's remarkable: the position.

00:07:49.066 --> 00:07:53.498
The missionary position is very rare in the animal kingdom.

00:07:53.498 --> 00:07:57.682
These are pigeons in Rotterdam.

00:08:00.045 --> 00:08:03.523
Barn swallows in Hong Kong, 2004.

00:08:03.523 --> 00:08:07.287
This is a turkey in Wisconsin

00:08:07.287 --> 00:08:13.366
on the premises of the Ethan Allen juvenile correctional institution.

00:08:13.366 --> 00:08:15.814
It took all day,

00:08:15.814 --> 00:08:20.945
and the prisoners had a great time.

00:08:20.945 --> 00:08:22.877
So what does this mean?

00:08:22.877 --> 00:08:26.125
I mean, the question I ask myself,

00:08:26.125 --> 00:08:27.826
why does this happen in nature?

00:08:27.826 --> 00:08:29.637
Well, what I concluded

00:08:29.637 --> 00:08:32.096
from reviewing all these cases

00:08:32.096 --> 00:08:36.064
is that it is important that this happens

00:08:36.064 --> 00:08:40.111
only when death is instant

00:08:40.111 --> 00:08:42.326
and in a dramatic way

00:08:42.326 --> 00:08:45.263
and in the right position for copulation.

00:08:45.263 --> 00:08:50.921
At least, I thought it was till I got these slides.

00:08:50.921 --> 00:08:53.344
And here you see a dead duck.

00:08:53.344 --> 00:08:55.936
It's been there for three days,

00:08:55.936 --> 00:08:57.990
and it's laying on its back.

00:08:57.990 --> 00:09:03.848
So there goes my theory of necrophilia.

00:09:03.848 --> 00:09:05.238
Another example of the impact

00:09:05.238 --> 00:09:07.231
of glass buildings on the life of birds.

00:09:07.231 --> 00:09:10.576
This is Mad Max, a blackbird who lives in Rotterdam.

00:09:10.576 --> 00:09:16.462
The only thing this bird did was fly against this window

00:09:16.462 --> 00:09:21.414
from 2004 to 2008, day in and day out.

00:09:21.414 --> 00:09:24.363
Here he goes, and here's a short video.

00:09:24.363 --> 00:09:26.085
(Music) (Clunk)

00:09:32.223 --> 00:09:33.407
(Clunk)

00:09:46.527 --> 00:09:48.169
(Clunk)

00:09:57.055 --> 00:09:58.570
(Clunk)

00:09:59.278 --> 00:10:01.325
So what this bird does

00:10:01.325 --> 00:10:05.423
is fight his own image.

00:10:05.423 --> 00:10:07.701
He sees an intruder in his territory,

00:10:07.701 --> 00:10:10.773
and it's coming all the time and he's there,

00:10:10.773 --> 00:10:12.616
so there is no end to it.

00:10:12.616 --> 00:10:15.799
And I thought, in the beginning -- I studied this bird for a couple of years --

00:10:15.799 --> 00:10:19.045
that, well, shouldn't the brain of this bird be damaged?

00:10:19.045 --> 00:10:22.093
It's not. I show you here some slides,

00:10:22.093 --> 00:10:24.144
some frames from the video,

00:10:24.144 --> 00:10:27.391
and at the last moment before he hits the glass,

00:10:27.391 --> 00:10:29.402
he puts his feet in front,

00:10:29.402 --> 00:10:34.221
and then he bangs against the glass.

00:10:34.221 --> 00:10:38.865
So I'll conclude to invite you all to Dead Duck Day.

00:10:38.865 --> 00:10:41.567
That's on June 5 every year.

00:10:41.567 --> 00:10:44.799
At five minutes to six in the afternoon,

00:10:44.799 --> 00:10:48.713
we come together at the Natural History Museum in Rotterdam,

00:10:48.713 --> 00:10:51.352
the duck comes out of the museum,

00:10:51.352 --> 00:10:53.847
and we try to discuss new ways

00:10:53.847 --> 00:10:57.701
to prevent birds from colliding with windows.

00:10:57.701 --> 00:11:00.136
And as you know, or as you may not know,

00:11:00.136 --> 00:11:02.735
this is one of the major causes of death

00:11:02.735 --> 00:11:04.240
for birds in the world.

00:11:04.240 --> 00:11:07.111
In the U.S. alone, a billion birds die

00:11:07.111 --> 00:11:10.336
in collision with glass buildings.

00:11:10.336 --> 00:11:16.263
And when it's over, we go to a Chinese restaurant

00:11:16.263 --> 00:11:21.021
and we have a six-course duck dinner.

00:11:21.021 --> 00:11:23.871
So I hope to see you

00:11:23.871 --> 00:11:26.926
next year in Rotterdam, the Netherlands,

00:11:26.926 --> 00:11:28.273
for Dead Duck Day.

00:11:28.273 --> 00:11:29.544
Thank you.

00:11:29.544 --> 00:11:31.562
(Applause)

00:11:31.562 --> 00:11:37.274
Oh, sorry.

00:11:37.274 --> 00:11:39.383
May I have my duck back, please?

00:11:39.383 --> 00:11:42.491
(Laughter) (Applause)

00:11:42.491 --> 00:11:47.169
Thank you.
