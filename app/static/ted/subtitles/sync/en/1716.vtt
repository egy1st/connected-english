00:00:21.703 --> 00:00:24.769
When I was 14 years old,

00:00:24.793 --> 00:00:26.756
I had low self-esteem.

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:30.369
I felt I was not talented at anything.

00:00:31.464 --> 00:00:34.453
One day, I bought a yo-yo.

00:00:35.683 --> 00:00:39.018
When I tried my first trick,
it looked like this:

00:00:40.921 --> 00:00:45.679
(Laughter)

00:00:45.703 --> 00:00:48.481
I couldn't even do the simplest trick,

00:00:48.505 --> 00:00:50.822
but it was very natural for me,

00:00:50.846 --> 00:00:54.814
because I was not dextrous,
and hated all sports.

00:00:55.711 --> 00:00:58.448
But after one week of practicing,

00:00:58.472 --> 00:01:00.865
my throws became more like this:

00:01:06.735 --> 00:01:07.885
A bit better.

00:01:08.984 --> 00:01:12.894
I thought, the yo-yo
is something for me to be good at.

00:01:12.918 --> 00:01:15.625
For the first time in my life,

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:17.474
I found my passion.

00:01:19.006 --> 00:01:21.975
I was spending all my time practicing.

00:01:21.999 --> 00:01:26.324
It took me hours and hours a day
to build my skills up to the next level.

00:01:27.498 --> 00:01:31.528
And then, four years later,
when I was 18 years old,

00:01:32.218 --> 00:01:35.475
I was standing onstage
at the World YoYo Contest.

00:01:35.499 --> 00:01:36.649
And I won.

00:01:37.029 --> 00:01:38.199
I was so excited.

00:01:38.223 --> 00:01:40.802
"Yes, I did it! I became a hero.

00:01:40.826 --> 00:01:43.170
I may get many sponsors, a lot of money,

00:01:43.194 --> 00:01:45.980
tons of interviews,
and be on TV!" I thought.

00:01:46.004 --> 00:01:47.726
(Laughter)

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:50.970
But after coming back to Japan,

00:01:50.994 --> 00:01:53.998
totally nothing changed in my life.

00:01:54.022 --> 00:01:55.624
(Laughter)

00:01:55.757 --> 00:01:58.993
I realized society
didn't value my passion.

00:02:00.318 --> 00:02:02.862
So I went back to my college

00:02:02.886 --> 00:02:05.993
and became a typical Japanese worker
as a systems engineer.

00:02:07.394 --> 00:02:13.001
I felt my passion,
heart and soul, had left my body.

00:02:13.725 --> 00:02:16.028
I felt I was not alive anymore.

00:02:16.544 --> 00:02:20.446
So I started to consider what I should do,

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:23.919
and I thought, I wanted to make
my performance better,

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:29.500
and to show onstage
how spectacular the yo-yo could be

00:02:29.524 --> 00:02:32.144
to change the public's image of the yo-yo.

00:02:33.671 --> 00:02:35.622
So I quit my company

00:02:36.559 --> 00:02:39.239
and started a career
as a professional performer.

00:02:40.549 --> 00:02:45.204
I started to learn classic ballet,
jazz dance, acrobatics and other things

00:02:45.228 --> 00:02:47.025
to make my performance better.

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:50.822
As a result of these efforts,
and the help of many others,

00:02:50.846 --> 00:02:51.996
it happened.

00:02:53.106 --> 00:02:56.916
I won the World YoYo Contest again
in the artistic performance division.

00:02:57.608 --> 00:03:00.290
I passed an audition for Cirque Du Soleil.

00:03:00.901 --> 00:03:04.733
Today, I am standing on the TED stage

00:03:04.757 --> 00:03:07.316
with the yo-yo in front of you.

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:11.522
(Applause)

00:03:11.693 --> 00:03:14.959
What I learned from the yo-yo is,

00:03:14.983 --> 00:03:19.038
if I make enough effort with huge passion,

00:03:19.848 --> 00:03:21.078
there is no impossible.

00:03:22.246 --> 00:03:25.118
Could you let me share my passion with you

00:03:25.142 --> 00:03:26.773
through my performance?

00:03:26.797 --> 00:03:31.540
(Applause)

00:03:58.147 --> 00:04:00.818
(Water sound)

00:04:04.801 --> 00:04:10.611
(Music)

00:07:46.940 --> 00:07:49.521
(Music ends)

00:07:49.545 --> 00:07:56.472
(Applause)

00:07:56.752 --> 00:08:03.752
(Music)

00:09:15.555 --> 00:09:20.303
(Music ends)

00:09:20.327 --> 00:09:27.327
(Applause)

00:09:42.420 --> 00:09:45.659
(Applause ends)

00:09:45.683 --> 00:09:52.683
(Music)

00:10:15.888 --> 00:10:22.888
(Applause)
