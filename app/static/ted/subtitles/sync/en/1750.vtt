00:00:20.588 --> 00:00:31.557
(Music)

00:02:45.874 --> 00:02:50.869
(Applause)

00:02:50.869 --> 00:02:53.984
Thank you.

00:02:53.984 --> 00:02:56.675
Hi, everybody.

00:02:56.675 --> 00:02:58.794
Ban-gap-seum-ni-da.

00:02:58.794 --> 00:03:01.628
I'd like to share with you a little bit of me

00:03:01.628 --> 00:03:03.740
playing my life.

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:06.429
I might look successful and happy

00:03:06.429 --> 00:03:08.527
being in front of you today,

00:03:08.527 --> 00:03:11.613
but I once suffered from severe depression

00:03:11.613 --> 00:03:13.978
and was in total despair.

00:03:13.978 --> 00:03:17.083
The violin, which meant everything to me,

00:03:17.083 --> 00:03:19.660
became a grave burden on me.

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:23.386
Although many people tried to comfort and encourage me,

00:03:23.386 --> 00:03:27.311
their words sounded like meaningless noise.

00:03:27.311 --> 00:03:30.673
When I was just about to give everything up

00:03:30.673 --> 00:03:33.036
after years of suffering,

00:03:33.036 --> 00:03:38.577
I started to rediscover the true power of music.

00:03:38.577 --> 00:03:53.466
(Music)

00:05:00.074 --> 00:05:02.926
In the midst of hardship,

00:05:02.926 --> 00:05:08.416
it was the music that gave me -- that restored my soul.

00:05:08.416 --> 00:05:10.185
The comfort the music gave me

00:05:10.185 --> 00:05:11.895
was just indescribable,

00:05:11.895 --> 00:05:16.059
and it was a real eye-opening experience for me too,

00:05:16.059 --> 00:05:19.363
and it totally changed my perspective on life

00:05:19.363 --> 00:05:22.019
and set me free from the pressure

00:05:22.019 --> 00:05:26.957
of becoming a successful violinist.

00:05:26.957 --> 00:05:30.096
Do you feel like you are all alone?

00:05:30.096 --> 00:05:33.655
I hope that this piece will touch and heal your heart,

00:05:33.655 --> 00:05:36.166
as it did for me.

00:05:36.166 --> 00:05:42.131
(Music)

00:06:52.201 --> 00:07:00.908
(Applause)

00:07:00.908 --> 00:07:02.653
Thank you.

00:07:02.653 --> 00:07:06.590
Now, I use my music to reach people's hearts

00:07:06.590 --> 00:07:09.269
and have found there are no boundaries.

00:07:09.269 --> 00:07:12.828
My audience is anyone who is here to listen,

00:07:12.828 --> 00:07:17.076
even those who are not familiar with classical music.

00:07:17.076 --> 00:07:21.925
I not only play at the prestigious classical concert halls

00:07:21.925 --> 00:07:23.860
like Carnegie Hall and Kennedy Center,

00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:27.651
but also hospitals, churches, prisons,

00:07:27.651 --> 00:07:31.871
and restricted facilities for leprosy patients,

00:07:31.871 --> 00:07:33.837
just to mention a few.

00:07:33.837 --> 00:07:38.447
Now, with my last piece, I'd like to show you

00:07:38.447 --> 00:07:42.128
that classical music can be so much fun, exciting,

00:07:42.128 --> 00:07:44.932
and that it can rock you.

00:07:44.932 --> 00:07:48.360
Let me introduce you to my brand new project,

00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:49.865
"Baroque in Rock,"

00:07:49.865 --> 00:07:53.557
which became a golden disc most recently.

00:07:53.557 --> 00:07:56.054
It's such an honor for me.

00:07:56.054 --> 00:08:00.295
I think, while I'm enjoying my life as a happy musician,

00:08:00.295 --> 00:08:04.928
I'm earning a lot more recognition than I've ever imagined.

00:08:04.928 --> 00:08:08.495
But it's now your turn.

00:08:08.495 --> 00:08:09.966
Changing your perspectives

00:08:09.966 --> 00:08:13.914
will not only transform you but also the whole world.

00:08:13.914 --> 00:08:16.397
Just play your life with all you have,

00:08:16.397 --> 00:08:18.731
and share it with the world.

00:08:18.731 --> 00:08:20.556
I really look forward to witnessing

00:08:20.556 --> 00:08:24.501
a transforming world by you, TEDsters.

00:08:24.501 --> 00:08:29.544
Play your life, and stay tuned.

00:08:29.560 --> 00:08:37.672
(Music)

00:12:19.329 --> 00:12:23.329
(Applause)
