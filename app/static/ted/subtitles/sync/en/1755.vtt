00:00:12.757 --> 00:00:15.469
So I was trained to become a gymnast

00:00:15.469 --> 00:00:19.125
for two years in Hunan, China in the 1970s.

00:00:19.125 --> 00:00:21.670
When I was in the first grade, the government

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:24.277
wanted to transfer me to a school for athletes,

00:00:24.277 --> 00:00:26.325
all expenses paid.

00:00:26.325 --> 00:00:28.973
But my tiger mother said, "No."

00:00:28.973 --> 00:00:31.109
My parents wanted me to become

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:33.213
an engineer like them.

00:00:33.213 --> 00:00:35.300
After surviving the Cultural Revolution,

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:39.109
they firmly believed there's only one sure way to happiness:

00:00:39.109 --> 00:00:42.042
a safe and well-paid job.

00:00:42.042 --> 00:00:44.837
It is not important if I like the job or not.

00:00:44.837 --> 00:00:50.117
But my dream was to become a Chinese opera singer.

00:00:50.117 --> 00:00:53.765
That is me playing my imaginary piano.

00:00:53.765 --> 00:00:55.949
An opera singer must start training young

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:57.533
to learn acrobatics,

00:00:57.533 --> 00:01:00.477
so I tried everything I could to go to opera school.

00:01:00.477 --> 00:01:02.744
I even wrote to the school principal

00:01:02.744 --> 00:01:05.505
and the host of a radio show.

00:01:05.505 --> 00:01:09.311
But no adults liked the idea.

00:01:09.311 --> 00:01:12.034
No adults believed I was serious.

00:01:12.034 --> 00:01:15.278
Only my friends supported me, but they were kids,

00:01:15.278 --> 00:01:18.034
just as powerless as I was.

00:01:18.034 --> 00:01:23.799
So at age 15, I knew I was too old to be trained.

00:01:23.799 --> 00:01:26.766
My dream would never come true.

00:01:26.766 --> 00:01:30.074
I was afraid that for the rest of my life

00:01:30.074 --> 00:01:32.111
some second-class happiness

00:01:32.111 --> 00:01:34.648
would be the best I could hope for.

00:01:34.648 --> 00:01:37.076
But that's so unfair.

00:01:37.076 --> 00:01:40.878
So I was determined to find another calling.

00:01:40.878 --> 00:01:43.615
Nobody around to teach me? Fine.

00:01:43.615 --> 00:01:45.847
I turned to books.

00:01:45.847 --> 00:01:49.489
I satisfied my hunger for parental advice

00:01:49.489 --> 00:01:54.366
from this book by a family of writers and musicians.["Correspondence in the Family of Fou Lei"]

00:01:54.366 --> 00:01:57.439
I found my role model of an independent woman

00:01:57.439 --> 00:02:01.283
when Confucian tradition requires obedience.["Jane Eyre"]

00:02:01.283 --> 00:02:04.980
And I learned to be efficient from this book.["Cheaper by the Dozen"]

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:08.945
And I was inspired to study abroad after reading these.

00:02:08.945 --> 00:02:11.016
["Complete Works of Sanmao" (aka Echo Chan)] ["Lessons From History" by Nan Huaijin]

00:02:11.016 --> 00:02:14.207
I came to the U.S. in 1995,

00:02:14.207 --> 00:02:17.088
so which books did I read here first?

00:02:17.088 --> 00:02:20.613
Books banned in China, of course.

00:02:20.613 --> 00:02:24.283
"The Good Earth" is about Chinese peasant life.

00:02:24.283 --> 00:02:28.385
That's just not convenient for propaganda. Got it.

00:02:28.385 --> 00:02:32.110
The Bible is interesting, but strange.

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:34.595
(Laughter)

00:02:34.595 --> 00:02:38.066
That's a topic for a different day.

00:02:38.066 --> 00:02:41.361
But the fifth commandment gave me an epiphany:

00:02:41.361 --> 00:02:44.340
"You shall honor your father and mother."

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:47.290
"Honor," I said. "That's so different,

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:49.029
and better, than obey."

00:02:49.029 --> 00:02:51.533
So it becomes my tool to climb out

00:02:51.533 --> 00:02:53.649
of this Confucian guilt trap

00:02:53.649 --> 00:02:57.921
and to restart my relationship with my parents.

00:02:57.921 --> 00:03:00.943
Encountering a new culture also started my habit

00:03:00.943 --> 00:03:02.715
of comparative reading.

00:03:02.715 --> 00:03:04.570
It offers many insights.

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:09.350
For example, I found this map out of place at first

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:14.235
because this is what Chinese students grew up with.

00:03:14.235 --> 00:03:15.736
It had never occurred to me,

00:03:15.736 --> 00:03:18.871
China doesn't have to be at the center of the world.

00:03:18.871 --> 00:03:23.124
A map actually carries somebody's view.

00:03:23.124 --> 00:03:25.532
Comparative reading actually is nothing new.

00:03:25.532 --> 00:03:28.836
It's a standard practice in the academic world.

00:03:28.836 --> 00:03:30.304
There are even research fields

00:03:30.304 --> 00:03:34.249
such as comparative religion and comparative literature.

00:03:34.249 --> 00:03:36.484
Compare and contrast gives scholars

00:03:36.484 --> 00:03:39.490
a more complete understanding of a topic.

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:41.243
So I thought, well, if comparative reading

00:03:41.243 --> 00:03:45.079
works for research, why not do it in daily life too?

00:03:45.079 --> 00:03:48.454
So I started reading books in pairs.

00:03:48.454 --> 00:03:49.668
So they can be about people --

00:03:49.668 --> 00:03:50.551
["Benjamin Franklin" by Walter Isaacson]["John Adams" by David McCullough] --

00:03:50.551 --> 00:03:53.059
who are involved in the same event,

00:03:53.059 --> 00:03:55.738
or friends with shared experiences.

00:03:55.738 --> 00:03:57.138
["Personal History" by Katharine Graham]["The Snowball: Warren Buffett and the Business of Life," by Alice Schroeder]

00:03:57.138 --> 00:04:01.536
I also compare the same stories in different genres -- (Laughter)

00:04:01.536 --> 00:04:03.648
[Holy Bible: King James Version]["Lamb" by Chrisopher Moore] --

00:04:03.648 --> 00:04:06.785
or similar stories from different cultures,

00:04:06.785 --> 00:04:09.666
as Joseph Campbell did in his wonderful book.["The Power of Myth" by Joseph Campbell]

00:04:09.666 --> 00:04:13.059
For example, both the Christ and the Buddha

00:04:13.059 --> 00:04:15.492
went through three temptations.

00:04:15.492 --> 00:04:17.294
For the Christ, the temptations

00:04:17.294 --> 00:04:21.269
are economic, political and spiritual.

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:25.595
For the Buddha, they are all psychological:

00:04:25.595 --> 00:04:32.913
lust, fear and social duty -- interesting.

00:04:32.913 --> 00:04:35.952
So if you know a foreign language, it's also fun

00:04:35.952 --> 00:04:37.849
to read your favorite books in two languages.

00:04:37.849 --> 00:04:39.101
["The Way of Chuang Tzu" Thomas Merton]["Tao: The Watercourse Way" Alan Watts]

00:04:39.101 --> 00:04:42.661
Instead of lost in translation, I found there is much to gain.

00:04:42.677 --> 00:04:46.885
For example, it's through translation that I realized

00:04:46.885 --> 00:04:52.858
"happiness" in Chinese literally means "fast joy." Huh!

00:04:52.858 --> 00:04:58.147
"Bride" in Chinese literally means "new mother." Uh-oh.

00:04:58.147 --> 00:05:01.408
(Laughter)

00:05:01.408 --> 00:05:06.795
Books have given me a magic portal to connect with people

00:05:06.795 --> 00:05:09.440
of the past and the present.

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:13.675
I know I shall never feel lonely or powerless again.

00:05:13.675 --> 00:05:16.352
Having a dream shattered really is nothing

00:05:16.352 --> 00:05:19.288
compared to what many others have suffered.

00:05:19.288 --> 00:05:22.016
I have come to believe that coming true

00:05:22.016 --> 00:05:25.296
is not the only purpose of a dream.

00:05:25.296 --> 00:05:29.197
Its most important purpose is to get us in touch

00:05:29.197 --> 00:05:31.312
with where dreams come from,

00:05:31.312 --> 00:05:34.216
where passion comes from, where happiness comes from.

00:05:34.216 --> 00:05:38.438
Even a shattered dream can do that for you.

00:05:38.438 --> 00:05:40.692
So because of books, I'm here today,

00:05:40.692 --> 00:05:44.352
happy, living again with a purpose and a clarity,

00:05:44.352 --> 00:05:46.102
most of the time.

00:05:46.102 --> 00:05:49.663
So may books be always with you.

00:05:49.663 --> 00:05:51.141
Thank you.

00:05:51.141 --> 00:05:52.989
(Applause)

00:05:52.989 --> 00:05:56.634
Thank you. (Applause)

00:05:56.634 --> 00:06:01.727
Thank you. (Applause)
