WEBVTT

00:00:12.731 --> 00:00:14.977
I'd like to talk to you today

00:00:15.001 --> 00:00:19.163
about a whole new way to think
about sexual activity

00:00:19.187 --> 00:00:23.236
and sexuality education, by comparison.

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:25.902
If you talk to someone today in America

00:00:25.926 --> 00:00:27.726
about sexual activity,

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.374
you'll find pretty soon
you're not just talking

00:00:31.398 --> 00:00:33.032
about sexual activity.

00:00:33.056 --> 00:00:36.078
You're also talking about baseball.

00:00:36.102 --> 00:00:40.312
Because baseball is the dominant
cultural metaphor

00:00:40.336 --> 00:00:42.830
that Americans use to think about

00:00:42.854 --> 00:00:45.679
and talk about sexual activity,

00:00:45.703 --> 00:00:47.227
and we know that because there's

00:00:47.251 --> 00:00:49.811
all this language in English

00:00:49.835 --> 00:00:52.756
that seems to be talking about baseball

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:56.615
but that's really talking
about sexual activity.

00:00:56.639 --> 00:00:59.814
So, for example, you can
be a pitcher or a catcher,

00:00:59.838 --> 00:01:01.741
and that corresponds to whether you

00:01:01.765 --> 00:01:05.509
perform a sexual act
or receive a sexual act.

00:01:05.533 --> 00:01:06.515
Of course, there are the bases,

00:01:06.539 --> 00:01:09.733
which refer to specific sexual activities

00:01:09.757 --> 00:01:12.948
that happen in a very specific order,

00:01:12.972 --> 00:01:15.726
ultimately resulting in scoring a run

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:16.730
or hitting a home run,

00:01:16.754 --> 00:01:19.038
which is usually having
vaginal intercourse

00:01:19.062 --> 00:01:20.750
to the point of orgasm,

00:01:20.774 --> 00:01:23.143
at least for the guy.

00:01:23.167 --> 00:01:25.072
(Laughter)

00:01:25.096 --> 00:01:26.573
You can strike out, which means

00:01:26.597 --> 00:01:29.058
you don't get to have any sexual activity.

00:01:29.082 --> 00:01:30.416
And if you're a benchwarmer,

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:32.831
you might be a virgin or somebody who for

00:01:32.855 --> 00:01:35.080
whatever reason isn't in the game,

00:01:35.104 --> 00:01:38.245
maybe because of your age
or because of your ability

00:01:38.269 --> 00:01:41.291
or because of your skillset.

00:01:41.315 --> 00:01:42.909
A bat's a penis,

00:01:42.933 --> 00:01:46.978
and a nappy dugout
is a vulva, or a vagina.

00:01:47.002 --> 00:01:50.086
A glove or a catcher's mitt is a condom.

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:53.003
A switch-hitter is a bisexual person,

00:01:53.027 --> 00:01:56.695
and we gay and lesbian folks
play for the other team.

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:59.294
And then there's this one:

00:01:59.318 --> 00:02:03.318
"if there's grass
on the field, play ball."

00:02:03.342 --> 00:02:05.722
And that usually refers to

00:02:05.746 --> 00:02:09.079
if a young person, specifically
often a young woman,

00:02:09.103 --> 00:02:10.811
is old enough to have pubic hair,

00:02:10.835 --> 00:02:13.536
she's old enough to have sex with.

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.519
This baseball model
is incredibly problematic.

00:02:16.543 --> 00:02:18.870
It's sexist. It's heterosexist.

00:02:18.894 --> 00:02:21.246
It's competitive. It's goal-directed.

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:24.029
And it can't result in healthy sexuality

00:02:24.053 --> 00:02:27.077
developing in young people or in adults.

00:02:27.101 --> 00:02:28.799
So we need a new model.

00:02:28.823 --> 00:02:31.358
I'm here today to offer
you that new model.

00:02:31.382 --> 00:02:33.133
And it's based on

00:02:33.157 --> 00:02:34.959
pizza.

00:02:34.983 --> 00:02:38.406
Now pizza is something
that is universally understood

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:41.303
and that most people associate
with a positive experience.

00:02:41.327 --> 00:02:42.283
So let's do this.

00:02:42.307 --> 00:02:45.252
Let's take baseball
and pizza and compare it

00:02:45.276 --> 00:02:48.696
when talking about three aspects
of sexual activity:

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:50.349
the trigger for sexual activity,

00:02:50.373 --> 00:02:52.567
what happens during sexual activity,

00:02:52.591 --> 00:02:55.719
and the expected outcome
of sexual activity.

00:02:55.743 --> 00:02:58.527
So when do you play baseball?

00:02:58.551 --> 00:03:00.967
You play baseball when
it's baseball season

00:03:00.991 --> 00:03:03.249
and when there's a game on the schedule.

00:03:03.273 --> 00:03:05.559
It's not exactly your choice.

00:03:05.583 --> 00:03:08.455
So if it's prom night or a wedding night

00:03:08.479 --> 00:03:11.525
or at a party or if our parents
aren't home,

00:03:11.549 --> 00:03:14.257
hey, it's just batter up.

00:03:14.281 --> 00:03:16.043
Can you imagine saying to your coach,

00:03:16.067 --> 00:03:18.544
"Uh, I'm not really feeling it today,

00:03:18.568 --> 00:03:20.611
I think I'll sit this game out."

00:03:20.635 --> 00:03:22.703
That's just not the way it happens.

00:03:22.727 --> 00:03:24.775
And when you get together
to play baseball,

00:03:24.799 --> 00:03:27.226
immediately you're
with two opposing teams,

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:29.556
one playing offense, one playing defense,

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:32.351
somebody's trying to move
deeper into the field.

00:03:32.375 --> 00:03:34.284
That's usually a sign to the boy.

00:03:34.308 --> 00:03:37.320
Somebody's trying to defend
people moving into the field.

00:03:37.344 --> 00:03:39.549
That's often given to the girl.

00:03:39.573 --> 00:03:40.584
It's competitive.

00:03:40.608 --> 00:03:42.373
We're not playing with each other.

00:03:42.397 --> 00:03:43.780
We're playing against each other.

00:03:43.804 --> 00:03:45.712
And when you show up to play baseball,

00:03:45.736 --> 00:03:48.256
nobody needs to talk
about what we're going to do

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:50.797
or how this baseball game
might be good for us.

00:03:50.821 --> 00:03:52.060
Everybody knows the rules.

00:03:52.084 --> 00:03:56.439
You just take your position
and play the game.

00:03:56.463 --> 00:03:58.799
But when do you have pizza?

00:03:58.823 --> 00:04:03.041
Well, you have pizza when
you're hungry for pizza.

00:04:03.065 --> 00:04:07.135
It starts with an internal sense,
an internal desire, or a need.

00:04:07.159 --> 00:04:10.807
"Huh. I could go for some pizza."

00:04:10.831 --> 00:04:13.064
(Laughter)

00:04:13.088 --> 00:04:16.041
And because it's an internal desire,

00:04:16.065 --> 00:04:18.399
we actually have some sense
of control over that.

00:04:18.423 --> 00:04:19.953
I could decide that I'm hungry

00:04:19.977 --> 00:04:23.484
but know that it's not
a great time to eat.

00:04:23.508 --> 00:04:26.146
And then when we get together
with someone for pizza,

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:28.996
we're not competing with them,

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:30.496
we're looking for an experience

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:31.782
that both of us will share

00:04:31.806 --> 00:04:33.756
that's satisfying for both of us,

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:36.761
and when you get together
for pizza with somebody,

00:04:36.785 --> 00:04:38.309
what's the first thing you do?

00:04:38.333 --> 00:04:40.231
You talk about it.

00:04:40.255 --> 00:04:41.762
You talk about what you want.

00:04:41.786 --> 00:04:43.255
You talk about what you like.

00:04:43.279 --> 00:04:44.811
You may even negotiate it.

00:04:44.835 --> 00:04:47.580
"How do you feel
about pepperoni?" (Laughter)

00:04:47.604 --> 00:04:50.207
"Not so much, I'm kind
of a mushroom guy myself."

00:04:50.231 --> 00:04:52.273
"Well, maybe we can go half and half."

00:04:52.297 --> 00:04:54.297
And even if you've had pizza with somebody

00:04:54.321 --> 00:04:57.332
for a very long time,

00:04:57.356 --> 00:04:59.394
don't you still say things like,

00:04:59.418 --> 00:05:01.387
"Should we get the usual?"

00:05:01.411 --> 00:05:02.550
(Laughter)

00:05:02.574 --> 00:05:06.307
"Or maybe something
a little more adventurous?"

00:05:06.331 --> 00:05:08.141
Okay, so when you're playing baseball,

00:05:08.165 --> 00:05:10.259
so if we talk
about during sexual activity,

00:05:10.283 --> 00:05:11.664
when you're playing baseball,

00:05:11.688 --> 00:05:14.192
you're just supposed to round the bases

00:05:14.216 --> 00:05:16.672
in the proper order one at a time.

00:05:16.696 --> 00:05:18.887
You can't hit the ball
and run to right field.

00:05:18.911 --> 00:05:20.109
That doesn't work.

00:05:20.133 --> 00:05:22.427
And you also can't get
to second base and say,

00:05:22.451 --> 00:05:26.827
"I like it here. I'm going to stay here."

00:05:26.851 --> 00:05:28.248
No.

00:05:28.272 --> 00:05:30.653
And also, of course,
with baseball, there's, like,

00:05:30.677 --> 00:05:33.153
the specific equipment
and a specific skill set.

00:05:33.177 --> 00:05:36.780
Not everybody can play baseball.
It's pretty exclusive.

00:05:36.804 --> 00:05:38.438
Okay, but what about pizza?

00:05:38.462 --> 00:05:41.034
When we're trying to figure
out what's good for pizza,

00:05:41.058 --> 00:05:43.719
isn't it all about what's our pleasure?

00:05:43.743 --> 00:05:45.451
There are a million different
kinds of pizza.

00:05:45.475 --> 00:05:47.237
There's a million different toppings.

00:05:47.261 --> 00:05:49.539
There's a million different
ways to eat pizza.

00:05:49.563 --> 00:05:52.488
And none of them are wrong.
They're different.

00:05:52.512 --> 00:05:54.936
And in this case, difference is good,

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:57.008
because that's going
to increase the chance

00:05:57.032 --> 00:05:59.592
that we're having a satisfying experience.

00:05:59.616 --> 00:06:02.552
And lastly, what's the expected
outcome of baseball?

00:06:02.576 --> 00:06:06.250
Well, in baseball, you play to win.

00:06:06.274 --> 00:06:08.783
You score as many runs as you can.

00:06:08.807 --> 00:06:10.771
There's always a winner in baseball,

00:06:10.795 --> 00:06:14.192
and that means there's always
a loser in baseball.

00:06:14.216 --> 00:06:15.848
But what about pizza?

00:06:15.872 --> 00:06:18.059
Well, in pizza, we're not really --

00:06:18.083 --> 00:06:21.726
there's no winning. How do you win pizza?

00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:24.981
You don't. But you do look for,

00:06:25.005 --> 00:06:26.702
"Are we satisfied?"

00:06:26.726 --> 00:06:28.774
And sometimes that can
be different amounts

00:06:28.798 --> 00:06:30.941
over different times
or with different people

00:06:30.965 --> 00:06:32.858
or on different days.

00:06:32.882 --> 00:06:35.988
And we get to decide
when we feel satisfied.

00:06:36.012 --> 00:06:38.826
If we're still hungry,
we might have some more.

00:06:38.850 --> 00:06:40.364
If you eat too much, though,

00:06:40.388 --> 00:06:42.269
you just feel gross.

00:06:42.293 --> 00:06:44.678
(Laughter)

00:06:44.702 --> 00:06:47.364
So what if we could take this pizza model

00:06:47.388 --> 00:06:50.736
and overlay it on top
of sexuality education?

00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:53.275
A lot of sexuality education
that happens today

00:06:53.299 --> 00:06:56.701
is so influenced by the baseball model,

00:06:56.725 --> 00:07:00.494
and it sets up education that can't help

00:07:00.518 --> 00:07:04.227
but produce unhealthy
sexuality in young people.

00:07:04.251 --> 00:07:06.490
And those young people
become older people.

00:07:06.514 --> 00:07:09.949
But if we could create sexuality education

00:07:09.973 --> 00:07:12.298
that was more like pizza,

00:07:12.322 --> 00:07:15.746
we could create education
that invites people

00:07:15.770 --> 00:07:18.041
to think about their own desires,

00:07:18.065 --> 00:07:21.293
to make deliberate decisions
about what they want,

00:07:21.317 --> 00:07:23.925
to talk about it with their partners,

00:07:23.949 --> 00:07:25.598
and to ultimately look for

00:07:25.622 --> 00:07:28.742
not some external outcome

00:07:28.766 --> 00:07:31.899
but for what feels satisfying,

00:07:31.923 --> 00:07:34.418
and we get to decide that.

00:07:34.442 --> 00:07:35.179
You may have noticed

00:07:35.203 --> 00:07:38.058
in the baseball and pizza comparison,

00:07:38.082 --> 00:07:40.898
under the baseball, it's all commands.

00:07:40.922 --> 00:07:42.995
They're all exclamation points.

00:07:43.019 --> 00:07:46.064
But under the pizza
model, they're questions.

00:07:46.088 --> 00:07:47.946
And who gets to answer those questions?

00:07:47.970 --> 00:07:51.606
You do. I do.

00:07:51.630 --> 00:07:53.506
So remember, when we're thinking about

00:07:53.530 --> 00:07:56.252
sexuality education and sexual activity,

00:07:56.276 --> 00:07:58.442
baseball, you're out.

00:07:58.466 --> 00:08:01.674
Pizza is the way to think about healthy,

00:08:01.698 --> 00:08:04.114
satisfying sexual activity,

00:08:04.138 --> 00:08:07.054
and good, comprehensive
sexuality education.

00:08:07.078 --> 00:08:09.284
Thank you very much for your time.

00:08:09.308 --> 00:08:13.970
(Applause)
