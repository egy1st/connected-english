00:00:12.607 --> 00:00:15.707
Throughout the history of computers

00:00:15.731 --> 00:00:18.954
we've been striving
to shorten the gap between us

00:00:18.978 --> 00:00:20.548
and digital information,

00:00:20.572 --> 00:00:22.382
the gap between our physical world

00:00:22.406 --> 00:00:24.180
and the world in the screen

00:00:24.204 --> 00:00:27.022
where our imagination can go wild.

00:00:27.046 --> 00:00:30.949
And this gap has become shorter,

00:00:30.973 --> 00:00:33.714
shorter, and even shorter,

00:00:33.738 --> 00:00:35.358
and now this gap is shortened down

00:00:35.382 --> 00:00:36.668
to less than a millimeter,

00:00:36.692 --> 00:00:38.546
the thickness of a touch-screen glass,

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:39.996
and the power of computing

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:44.899
has become accessible to everyone.

00:00:44.923 --> 00:00:49.938
But I wondered, what if there
could be no boundary at all?

00:00:49.962 --> 00:00:53.682
I started to imagine
what this would look like.

00:00:53.706 --> 00:00:56.133
First, I created this tool

00:00:56.157 --> 00:00:58.642
which penetrates into the digital space,

00:00:58.666 --> 00:01:00.733
so when you press it hard on the screen,

00:01:00.757 --> 00:01:04.066
it transfers its physical
body into pixels.

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:06.178
Designers can materialize their ideas

00:01:06.202 --> 00:01:07.874
directly in 3D,

00:01:07.898 --> 00:01:10.426
and surgeons can practice
on virtual organs

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:12.650
underneath the screen.

00:01:12.674 --> 00:01:17.547
So with this tool, this
boundary has been broken.

00:01:17.571 --> 00:01:20.514
But our two hands still
remain outside the screen.

00:01:20.538 --> 00:01:22.998
How can you reach inside and interact

00:01:23.022 --> 00:01:24.425
with the digital information

00:01:24.449 --> 00:01:27.429
using the full dexterity of our hands?

00:01:27.453 --> 00:01:29.731
At Microsoft Applied Sciences,

00:01:29.755 --> 00:01:31.647
along with my mentor Cati Boulanger,

00:01:31.671 --> 00:01:32.918
I redesigned the computer

00:01:32.942 --> 00:01:35.799
and turned a little space
above the keyboard

00:01:35.823 --> 00:01:38.164
into a digital workspace.

00:01:38.188 --> 00:01:40.665
By combining a transparent
display and depth cameras

00:01:40.689 --> 00:01:42.315
for sensing your fingers and face,

00:01:42.339 --> 00:01:44.625
now you can lift up your hands
from the keyboard

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:47.463
and reach inside this 3D space

00:01:47.487 --> 00:01:49.963
and grab pixels with your bare hands.

00:01:49.987 --> 00:01:52.934
(Applause)

00:01:52.958 --> 00:01:57.140
Because windows and files have
a position in the real space,

00:01:57.164 --> 00:02:00.499
selecting them is as easy
as grabbing a book off your shelf.

00:02:00.523 --> 00:02:02.652
Then you can flip through this book

00:02:02.676 --> 00:02:04.369
while highlighting the lines, words

00:02:04.393 --> 00:02:06.933
on the virtual touch pad
below each floating window.

00:02:06.957 --> 00:02:09.468
Architects can stretch
or rotate the models

00:02:09.492 --> 00:02:11.893
with their two hands directly.

00:02:11.917 --> 00:02:13.513
So in these examples,

00:02:13.537 --> 00:02:16.250
we are reaching into the digital world.

00:02:16.274 --> 00:02:18.596
But how about reversing its role

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:23.415
and having the digital
information reach us instead?

00:02:23.439 --> 00:02:25.487
I'm sure many of us
have had the experience

00:02:25.511 --> 00:02:27.594
of buying and returning items online.

00:02:27.618 --> 00:02:29.571
But now you don't have to worry about it.

00:02:29.595 --> 00:02:34.209
What I got here is an online
augmented fitting room.

00:02:34.233 --> 00:02:36.111
This is a view that you get from

00:02:36.135 --> 00:02:37.855
head-mounted or see-through display

00:02:37.879 --> 00:02:43.002
when the system understands
the geometry of your body.

00:02:43.026 --> 00:02:46.553
Taking this idea further,
I started to think,

00:02:46.577 --> 00:02:49.922
instead of just seeing
these pixels in our space,

00:02:49.946 --> 00:02:51.444
how can we make it physical

00:02:51.468 --> 00:02:55.706
so that we can touch and feel it?

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:58.755
What would such a future look like?

00:02:58.779 --> 00:03:02.413
At MIT Media Lab,
along with my advisor Hiroshi Ishii

00:03:02.437 --> 00:03:04.436
and my collaborator Rehmi Post,

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:08.080
we created this one physical pixel.

00:03:08.104 --> 00:03:10.704
Well, in this case, this spherical magnet

00:03:10.728 --> 00:03:13.056
acts like a 3D pixel in our space,

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:15.960
which means that both computers and people

00:03:15.984 --> 00:03:17.858
can move this object to anywhere

00:03:17.882 --> 00:03:19.827
within this little 3D space.

00:03:19.851 --> 00:03:23.319
What we did was essentially
canceling gravity

00:03:23.343 --> 00:03:25.458
and controlling the movement by combining

00:03:25.482 --> 00:03:28.282
magnetic levitation
and mechanical actuation

00:03:28.306 --> 00:03:30.759
and sensing technologies.

00:03:30.783 --> 00:03:33.264
And by digitally programming the object,

00:03:33.288 --> 00:03:36.041
we are liberating
the object from constraints

00:03:36.065 --> 00:03:39.476
of time and space, which means that now,

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:43.372
human motions can be
recorded and played back

00:03:43.396 --> 00:03:46.991
and left permanently
in the physical world.

00:03:47.015 --> 00:03:50.024
So choreography can be taught
physically over distance

00:03:50.048 --> 00:03:52.620
and Michael Jordan's famous
shooting can be replicated

00:03:52.644 --> 00:03:56.098
over and over as a physical reality.

00:03:56.122 --> 00:03:58.278
Students can use this as a tool

00:03:58.302 --> 00:04:00.220
to learn about the complex concepts

00:04:00.244 --> 00:04:04.304
such as planetary motion, physics,

00:04:04.328 --> 00:04:07.123
and unlike computer screens or textbooks,

00:04:07.147 --> 00:04:09.605
this is a real, tangible experience

00:04:09.629 --> 00:04:13.263
that you can touch and feel,
and it's very powerful.

00:04:13.287 --> 00:04:15.245
And what's more exciting

00:04:15.269 --> 00:04:18.593
than just turning what's currently
in the computer physical

00:04:18.617 --> 00:04:21.782
is to start imagining
how programming the world

00:04:21.806 --> 00:04:25.502
will alter even our daily
physical activities.

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:30.068
(Laughter)

00:04:30.092 --> 00:04:32.825
As you can see, the digital information

00:04:32.849 --> 00:04:34.343
will not just show us something

00:04:34.367 --> 00:04:36.453
but it will start directly acting upon us

00:04:36.477 --> 00:04:38.752
as a part of our physical surroundings

00:04:38.776 --> 00:04:42.950
without disconnecting
ourselves from our world.

00:04:42.974 --> 00:04:47.296
Today, we started by talking
about the boundary,

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:49.976
but if we remove this boundary,

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.864
the only boundary left is our imagination.

00:04:53.888 --> 00:04:55.112
Thank you.

00:04:55.136 --> 00:05:00.221
(Applause)
