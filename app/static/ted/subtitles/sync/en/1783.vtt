WEBVTT

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:15.847
I'm going to start
by asking you a question:

00:00:15.847 --> 00:00:19.926
Is anyone familiar
with the blue algae problem?

00:00:19.926 --> 00:00:21.975
Okay, so most of you are.

00:00:21.975 --> 00:00:25.021
I think we can all agree
it's a serious issue.

00:00:25.021 --> 00:00:28.103
Nobody wants to drink
blue algae-contaminated water,

00:00:28.913 --> 00:00:32.938
or swim in a blue algae-infested lake.

00:00:33.478 --> 00:00:34.853
Right?

00:00:34.853 --> 00:00:36.929
I hope you won't be disappointed,

00:00:36.929 --> 00:00:40.135
but today,
I won't be talking about blue algae.

00:00:40.135 --> 00:00:43.960
Instead,
I'll be talking about the main cause

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:46.925
at the root of this issue,

00:00:46.925 --> 00:00:50.320
which I will be referring to as
the phosphorus crisis.

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:54.228
Why have I chosen to talk to you
about the phosphorus crisis today?

00:00:54.228 --> 00:00:57.487
For the simple reason
that nobody else is talking about it.

00:00:57.487 --> 00:01:01.754
And by the end of my presentation,
I hope that the general public

00:01:01.754 --> 00:01:06.320
will be more aware of this crisis
and this issue.

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:09.684
Now, the problem is that if I ask,

00:01:09.684 --> 00:01:12.738
why do we find ourselves
in this situation with blue algae?

00:01:12.738 --> 00:01:16.151
The answer is
that it comes from how we farm.

00:01:16.412 --> 00:01:20.186
We use fertilizers in our farming,
chemical fertilizers.

00:01:20.846 --> 00:01:23.253
Why do we use chemical fertilizers
in agriculture?

00:01:23.253 --> 00:01:27.603
Basically, to help plants grow
and to produce a better yield.

00:01:28.493 --> 00:01:30.937
The issue is that this is set to engender

00:01:30.937 --> 00:01:34.231
an environmental problem
that is without precedent.

00:01:35.621 --> 00:01:39.187
Before going further, let me give you
a crash course in plant biology.

00:01:39.187 --> 00:01:41.652
So, what does a plant need
in order to grow?

00:01:41.652 --> 00:01:46.202
A plant, quite simply,
needs light, it needs CO2,

00:01:46.202 --> 00:01:49.817
but even more importantly,
it needs nutrients,

00:01:49.817 --> 00:01:52.842
which it draws from the soil.

00:01:53.432 --> 00:01:57.047
Several of these nutrients
are essential chemical elements:

00:01:57.047 --> 00:02:00.093
phosphorus, nitrogen and calcium.

00:02:00.093 --> 00:02:04.822
So, the plant’s roots will extract
these resources.

00:02:04.822 --> 00:02:08.686
Today I'll be focusing on a major problem
that is linked to phosphorus.

00:02:08.686 --> 00:02:10.373
Why phosphorus in particular?

00:02:10.373 --> 00:02:13.012
Because it is
the most problematic chemical element.

00:02:13.722 --> 00:02:16.703
By the end of my presentation,
you will have seen

00:02:16.843 --> 00:02:20.039
what these problems are,
and where we are today.

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:23.922
Phosphorus is a chemical element

00:02:23.922 --> 00:02:27.315
that is essential to life.
This is a very important point.

00:02:27.315 --> 00:02:30.966
I’d like everyone to understand precisely
what the phosphorus issue is.

00:02:30.966 --> 00:02:35.138
Phosphorus is a key component
in several molecules,

00:02:35.138 --> 00:02:37.791
in many of our molecules of life.

00:02:37.791 --> 00:02:39.784
Experts in the field will know

00:02:39.784 --> 00:02:42.747
that cellular communication
is phosphorus-based --

00:02:42.747 --> 00:02:44.961
phosphorylation, dephosphorylation.

00:02:45.371 --> 00:02:50.272
Cell membranes are phosphorus-based:
These are called phospholipids.

00:02:50.972 --> 00:02:55.722
The energy in all living things,
ATP, is phosphorus-based.

00:02:55.722 --> 00:03:01.805
And more importantly still,
phosphorus is a key component of DNA,

00:03:02.605 --> 00:03:07.205
something everyone is familiar with,
and which is shown in this image.

00:03:07.205 --> 00:03:10.489
DNA is our genetic heritage.

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:14.840
It is extremely important, and once again,
phosphorus is a key player.

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:18.958
Now, where do we find this phosphorus?

00:03:19.458 --> 00:03:23.019
As humans, where do we find it?

00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:24.508
As I explained earlier,

00:03:24.508 --> 00:03:29.007
plants extract phosphorus
from the soil, through water.

00:03:29.297 --> 00:03:31.982
So, we humans get it
from the things we eat:

00:03:32.872 --> 00:03:35.267
plants, vegetables, fruits,

00:03:35.547 --> 00:03:38.552
and also from eggs, meat and milk.

00:03:39.062 --> 00:03:42.119
It’s true that some humans
eat better than others.

00:03:42.119 --> 00:03:44.095
Some are happier than others.

00:03:44.755 --> 00:03:48.936
And now, looking at this picture,
which speaks for itself,

00:03:49.226 --> 00:03:51.042
we see modern agriculture,

00:03:51.042 --> 00:03:54.598
which I also refer to
as intensive agriculture.

00:03:54.598 --> 00:03:59.054
Intensive agriculture is based
on the use of chemical fertilizers.

00:03:59.054 --> 00:04:02.082
Without them,
we would not manage to produce enough

00:04:02.082 --> 00:04:05.110
to feed the world's population.

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:08.588
Speaking of humans, there are currently
7 billion of us on Earth.

00:04:08.888 --> 00:04:12.014
In less than 40 years,
there will be 9 billion of us.

00:04:12.014 --> 00:04:15.404
And the question is a simple one:
Do we have enough phosphorus

00:04:15.404 --> 00:04:18.274
to feed our future generations?

00:04:19.284 --> 00:04:23.366
So, in order to understand these issues,
where do we find our phosphorus?

00:04:23.366 --> 00:04:24.987
Let me explain.

00:04:25.147 --> 00:04:27.724
But first, let’s just suppose

00:04:27.994 --> 00:04:32.900
that we are using
100 percent of a given dose of phosphorus.

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:40.968
Only 15 percent of this 100 percent goes to the plant.
Eighty-five percent is lost.

00:04:42.428 --> 00:04:45.827
It goes into the soil,
ending its journey in the lakes,

00:04:46.097 --> 00:04:49.823
resulting in lakes with extra phosphorus,
which leads to the blue algae problem.

00:04:49.823 --> 00:04:53.561
So, you’ll see there’s a problem here,
something that is illogical.

00:04:53.561 --> 00:04:57.650
A hundred percent of the phosphorus is used,
but only 15 percent goes to the plant.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:59.934
You’re going to tell me it’s wasteful.

00:05:00.424 --> 00:05:04.551
Yes, it is. What is worse
is that it is very expensive.

00:05:04.551 --> 00:05:07.933
Nobody wants to throw their money
out the window,

00:05:07.933 --> 00:05:10.273
but unfortunately
that's what is happening here.

00:05:10.663 --> 00:05:13.469
Eighty percent of each dose of phosphorus is lost.

00:05:15.199 --> 00:05:20.851
Modern agriculture
depends on phosphorus.

00:05:20.851 --> 00:05:25.450
And because in order to get 15 percent of it
to the plant, all the rest is lost,

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:27.371
we have to add more and more.

00:05:27.371 --> 00:05:30.745
Now, where will we get
this phosphorus from?

00:05:31.285 --> 00:05:34.619
Basically, we get it out of mines.

00:05:35.139 --> 00:05:37.386
This is the cover
of an extraordinary article

00:05:37.666 --> 00:05:39.423
published in Nature in 2009,

00:05:39.423 --> 00:05:42.610
which really launched the discussion
about the phosphorus crisis.

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:47.573
Phosphorus, a nutrient essential to life,
which is becoming increasingly scarce,

00:05:47.573 --> 00:05:49.396
yet nobody is talking about it.

00:05:49.396 --> 00:05:55.260
And everyone agrees:
Politicians and scientists are in agreement

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:57.601
that we are headed
for a phosphorus crisis.

00:05:57.601 --> 00:06:01.049
What you are seeing here
is an open-pit mine in the U.S.,

00:06:01.049 --> 00:06:04.150
and to give you an idea
of the dimensions of this mine,

00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:07.704
if you look in the top right-hand corner,
the little crane you can see,

00:06:07.704 --> 00:06:09.169
that is a giant crane.

00:06:09.519 --> 00:06:12.553
So that really puts it into perspective.

00:06:12.553 --> 00:06:14.751
So, we get phosphorus from mines.

00:06:14.751 --> 00:06:17.199
And if I make a comparison with oil,

00:06:17.959 --> 00:06:21.330
there’s an oil crisis, we talk about it,
we talk about global warming,

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:23.354
yet we never mention
the phosphorus crisis.

00:06:23.354 --> 00:06:27.186
To come back to the oil problem,
oil is something we can replace.

00:06:27.556 --> 00:06:31.918
We can use biofuels, or solar power,

00:06:31.918 --> 00:06:35.682
or hydropower,
but phosphorus is an essential element,

00:06:35.682 --> 00:06:39.406
indispensable to life,
and we can’t replace it.

00:06:41.256 --> 00:06:44.919
What is the current state
of the world's phosphorus reserves?

00:06:44.919 --> 00:06:49.030
This graph gives you a rough idea
of where we are today.

00:06:49.030 --> 00:06:53.681
The black line represents predictions
for phosphorus reserves.

00:06:53.681 --> 00:06:56.305
In 2030, we’ll reach the peak.

00:06:56.305 --> 00:06:59.631
By the end of this century,
it will all be gone.

00:06:59.811 --> 00:07:03.696
The dotted line shows where we are today.

00:07:04.126 --> 00:07:07.598
As you can see, they meet in 2030,
I’ll be retired by then.

00:07:08.808 --> 00:07:12.377
But we are indeed heading
for a major crisis,

00:07:12.377 --> 00:07:15.649
and I’d like people to become aware
of this problem.

00:07:16.239 --> 00:07:17.879
Do we have a solution?

00:07:18.599 --> 00:07:21.711
What are we to do?
We are faced with a paradox.

00:07:22.681 --> 00:07:24.988
Less and less phosphorus
will be available.

00:07:25.268 --> 00:07:28.464
By 2050 there will be 9 billion of us,

00:07:28.634 --> 00:07:34.998
and according to
the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization,

00:07:35.248 --> 00:07:39.991
we will need to produce twice as much food
in 2050 than we do today.

00:07:39.991 --> 00:07:43.761
So, we will have less phosphorus,
but we'll need to produce more food.

00:07:44.291 --> 00:07:45.909
What should we do?

00:07:46.349 --> 00:07:48.439
It truly is a paradoxical situation.

00:07:49.179 --> 00:07:51.927
Do we have a solution,
or an alternative

00:07:51.927 --> 00:07:54.895
which will allow us to optimize
phosphorus use?

00:07:54.895 --> 00:07:58.265
Remember that 80 percent is destined to be lost.

00:08:00.515 --> 00:08:07.819
The solution I'm offering today is one
that has existed for a very long time,

00:08:07.819 --> 00:08:10.217
even before plants existed on Earth,

00:08:10.557 --> 00:08:14.035
and it's a microscopic mushroom
that is very mysterious,

00:08:14.035 --> 00:08:17.543
very simple,
and yet also extremely complex.

00:08:18.083 --> 00:08:22.771
I've been fascinated by this little mushroom
for over 16 years now.

00:08:22.771 --> 00:08:26.616
It has led me to further my research

00:08:26.616 --> 00:08:29.986
and to use it as a model
for my laboratory research.

00:08:29.986 --> 00:08:33.440
This mushroom exists in symbiosis
with the roots.

00:08:33.700 --> 00:08:39.087
By symbiosis, I mean a bidirectional
and mutually beneficial association

00:08:39.087 --> 00:08:42.115
which is also called mycorrhiza.

00:08:44.235 --> 00:08:47.292
This slide illustrates the elements
of a mycorrhiza.

00:08:47.292 --> 00:08:49.557
You’re looking at the root of wheat,

00:08:49.557 --> 00:08:52.901
one of the world’s most important plants.

00:08:53.651 --> 00:08:56.490
Normally, a root will find phosphorus
all by itself.

00:08:56.490 --> 00:08:58.522
It will go in search of phosphorus,

00:08:58.522 --> 00:09:01.764
but only within the one millimeter
which surrounds it.

00:09:02.194 --> 00:09:05.269
Beyond one millimeter,
the root is ineffective.

00:09:05.269 --> 00:09:07.594
It cannot go further
in its search for phosphorus.

00:09:07.594 --> 00:09:10.330
Now, imagine this tiny,
microscopic mushroom.

00:09:10.330 --> 00:09:12.591
It grows much faster,

00:09:12.591 --> 00:09:15.387
and is much better designed
to seek out phosphorus.

00:09:15.387 --> 00:09:18.766
It can go beyond
the root’s one-millimeter scope

00:09:18.766 --> 00:09:20.853
to seek out phosphorus.

00:09:20.853 --> 00:09:22.909
I haven’t invented anything at all;

00:09:22.909 --> 00:09:26.407
it's a biotechnology that has existed
for 450 million years.

00:09:26.407 --> 00:09:30.320
And over time, this mushroom
has evolved and adapted to seek out

00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:33.813
even the tiniest trace of phosphorus,
and to put it to use,

00:09:33.813 --> 00:09:36.146
to make it available to the plant.

00:09:36.866 --> 00:09:40.799
What you’re seeing here,
in the real world, is a carrot root,

00:09:41.439 --> 00:09:44.070
and the mushroom
with its very fine filaments.

00:09:44.070 --> 00:09:46.477
Looking closer,
we can see that this mushroom

00:09:46.477 --> 00:09:48.564
is very gentle in its penetration.

00:09:48.564 --> 00:09:52.253
It will proliferate
between the root's cells,

00:09:52.253 --> 00:09:55.336
eventually penetrating a cell

00:09:55.746 --> 00:10:00.430
and starting to form
a typical arbuscular structure,

00:10:00.750 --> 00:10:05.627
which will considerably increase
the exchange interface

00:10:05.627 --> 00:10:08.186
between the plant and the mushroom.

00:10:08.186 --> 00:10:11.631
And it is through this structure
that mutual exchanges will occur.

00:10:11.631 --> 00:10:13.267
It’s a win-win trade:

00:10:13.267 --> 00:10:15.832
I give you phosphorus, and you feed me.

00:10:16.142 --> 00:10:18.412
True symbiosis.

00:10:20.752 --> 00:10:23.520
Now let's add a mycorrhiza plant

00:10:23.520 --> 00:10:26.780
into the diagram I used earlier.

00:10:26.780 --> 00:10:31.857
And instead of using a 100 percent dose,
I’m going to reduce it to 25 percent.

00:10:31.857 --> 00:10:36.831
You’ll see that of this 25 percent,
most will benefit the plant,

00:10:36.831 --> 00:10:38.387
more than 90 percent.

00:10:38.387 --> 00:10:41.967
A very small amount of phosphorus
will remain in the soil.

00:10:41.967 --> 00:10:44.267
That's completely natural.

00:10:45.727 --> 00:10:49.598
What's more is that in certain cases,
we don't even need to add phosphorus.

00:10:49.598 --> 00:10:52.010
If you recall the graphs
I showed you earlier,

00:10:52.010 --> 00:10:55.231
85 percent of phosphorus is lost in the soil,

00:10:55.231 --> 00:10:58.476
and the plants are unable to access it.

00:10:58.476 --> 00:11:02.284
Even though it is present in the soil,
it is in insoluble form.

00:11:02.284 --> 00:11:05.294
The plant is only able to seek out
soluble forms.

00:11:05.294 --> 00:11:09.106
The mushroom is capable
of dissolving this insoluble form

00:11:09.106 --> 00:11:12.547
and making it available
for the plant to use.

00:11:12.547 --> 00:11:16.098
To further support my argument,
here is a picture that speaks for itself.

00:11:16.098 --> 00:11:19.986
These are trials
in a field of sorghum.

00:11:19.986 --> 00:11:24.498
On the left side, you see the yield
produced using conventional agriculture,

00:11:24.498 --> 00:11:27.080
with a 100 percent phosphorus dose.

00:11:27.240 --> 00:11:30.453
On the other side,
the dose was reduced to 50 percent,

00:11:30.453 --> 00:11:31.986
and just look at the yield.

00:11:31.986 --> 00:11:37.567
With only a half-dose,
we achieved a better yield.

00:11:37.567 --> 00:11:42.397
This is to show you
that this method works.

00:11:42.397 --> 00:11:46.966
And in some cases, in Cuba,
Mexico and India,

00:11:46.966 --> 00:11:50.253
the dose can be reduced to 25 percent,
and in several other cases,

00:11:50.253 --> 00:11:52.407
there's no need to add
any phosphorus at all,

00:11:52.407 --> 00:11:54.851
because the mushrooms are so well adapted

00:11:54.851 --> 00:11:57.587
to finding phosphorus
and drawing it from the soil.

00:11:58.047 --> 00:12:02.565
This is an example of soy production
in Canada.

00:12:03.885 --> 00:12:10.827
Mycorrhiza was used in one field
but not in the other.

00:12:11.497 --> 00:12:19.423
And here, where blue indicates a better yield,
and yellow a weaker yield.

00:12:20.913 --> 00:12:23.736
The black rectangle is the plot

00:12:23.736 --> 00:12:26.119
from which the mycorrhiza was added.

00:12:26.119 --> 00:12:29.487
In other words, as I already said,
I have invented nothing.

00:12:29.487 --> 00:12:32.237
Mycorrhiza has existed
for 450 million years,

00:12:32.237 --> 00:12:36.496
and it has even helped
modern-day plant species to diversify.

00:12:36.496 --> 00:12:41.055
So, this it isn't something
that is still undergoing lab tests.

00:12:41.055 --> 00:12:43.471
Mycorrhiza exists, it works,

00:12:43.471 --> 00:12:47.910
it's produced at an industrial scale
and commercialized worldwide.

00:12:47.910 --> 00:12:51.220
The problem is
that people are not aware of it.

00:12:51.220 --> 00:12:55.216
People like food producers and farmers
are still not aware of this problem.

00:12:55.216 --> 00:12:57.844
We have a technology that works,

00:12:57.844 --> 00:13:04.941
and one that, if used correctly,
will alleviate some of the pressure

00:13:04.941 --> 00:13:08.594
we are putting
on the world's phosphorus reserves.

00:13:09.364 --> 00:13:13.828
In conclusion,
I am a scientist and a dreamer.

00:13:14.518 --> 00:13:16.277
I'm passionate about this topic.

00:13:16.277 --> 00:13:19.565
So if you were to ask me
what my retirement dream is,

00:13:19.565 --> 00:13:22.391
which will be at the moment we reach
that phosphorus peak,

00:13:22.391 --> 00:13:26.347
it would be that we use one label,
"Made with mycorrhiza,"

00:13:26.347 --> 00:13:29.257
and that my children and grandchildren

00:13:29.257 --> 00:13:32.265
buy products bearing that label too.

00:13:32.265 --> 00:13:33.965
Thank you for your attention.

00:13:33.965 --> 00:13:36.466
