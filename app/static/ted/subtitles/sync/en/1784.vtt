00:00:12.547 --> 00:00:14.978
When we talk about corruption,

00:00:15.002 --> 00:00:18.448
there are typical types
of individuals that spring to mind.

00:00:18.472 --> 00:00:20.776
There's the former Soviet megalomaniacs.

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:23.965
Saparmurat Niyazov, he was one of them.

00:00:23.989 --> 00:00:25.953
Until his death in 2006,

00:00:25.977 --> 00:00:29.259
he was the all-powerful
leader of Turkmenistan,

00:00:29.283 --> 00:00:33.024
a Central Asian country
rich in natural gas.

00:00:33.048 --> 00:00:36.974
Now, he really loved to issue
presidential decrees.

00:00:36.998 --> 00:00:39.219
And one renamed the months of the year

00:00:39.243 --> 00:00:42.369
including after himself and his mother.

00:00:42.393 --> 00:00:44.403
He spent millions of dollars

00:00:44.427 --> 00:00:47.223
creating a bizarre personality cult,

00:00:47.247 --> 00:00:49.192
and his crowning glory was the building

00:00:49.216 --> 00:00:53.232
of a 40-foot-high gold-plated
statue of himself

00:00:53.256 --> 00:00:56.296
which stood proudly
in the capital's central square

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:59.288
and rotated to follow the sun.

00:00:59.312 --> 00:01:02.061
He was a slightly unusual guy.

00:01:02.085 --> 00:01:03.918
And then there's that cliché,

00:01:03.942 --> 00:01:07.317
the African dictator
or minister or official.

00:01:07.341 --> 00:01:10.428
There's Teodorín Obiang.

00:01:10.452 --> 00:01:14.659
So his daddy is president
for life of Equatorial Guinea,

00:01:14.683 --> 00:01:17.783
a West African nation that has exported

00:01:17.807 --> 00:01:21.264
billions of dollars of oil since the 1990s

00:01:21.288 --> 00:01:25.308
and yet has a truly appalling
human rights record.

00:01:25.332 --> 00:01:27.202
The vast majority of its people

00:01:27.226 --> 00:01:30.157
are living in really miserable poverty

00:01:30.181 --> 00:01:32.277
despite an income
per capita that's on a par

00:01:32.301 --> 00:01:34.775
with that of Portugal.

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:37.480
So Obiang junior, well, he buys himself

00:01:37.504 --> 00:01:41.912
a $30 million mansion
in Malibu, California.

00:01:41.936 --> 00:01:43.013
I've been up to its front gates.

00:01:43.037 --> 00:01:46.108
I can tell you it's a magnificent spread.

00:01:46.132 --> 00:01:49.827
He bought an €18 million art collection

00:01:49.851 --> 00:01:53.966
that used to belong to fashion
designer Yves Saint Laurent,

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:55.514
a stack of fabulous sports cars,

00:01:55.538 --> 00:01:58.069
some costing a million dollars apiece --

00:01:58.093 --> 00:02:00.385
oh, and a Gulfstream jet, too.

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:01.746
Now get this:

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:05.887
Until recently, he was earning
an official monthly salary

00:02:05.911 --> 00:02:10.041
of less than 7,000 dollars.

00:02:10.065 --> 00:02:12.094
And there's Dan Etete.

00:02:12.118 --> 00:02:14.738
Well, he was the former
oil minister of Nigeria

00:02:14.762 --> 00:02:16.712
under President Abacha,

00:02:16.736 --> 00:02:20.214
and it just so happens
he's a convicted money launderer too.

00:02:20.238 --> 00:02:22.456
We've spent a great deal of time

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:24.857
investigating a $1 billion --

00:02:24.881 --> 00:02:26.620
that's right, a $1 billion —

00:02:26.644 --> 00:02:29.281
oil deal that he was involved with,

00:02:29.305 --> 00:02:31.233
and what we found was pretty shocking,

00:02:31.257 --> 00:02:33.999
but more about that later.

00:02:34.023 --> 00:02:37.516
So it's easy to think
that corruption happens

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:39.376
somewhere over there,

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:41.832
carried out by a bunch of greedy despots

00:02:41.856 --> 00:02:43.856
and individuals up to no good in countries

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:46.864
that we, personally, may
know very little about

00:02:46.888 --> 00:02:48.553
and feel really unconnected to

00:02:48.577 --> 00:02:52.041
and unaffected by what might be going on.

00:02:52.065 --> 00:02:55.284
But does it just happen over there?

00:02:55.308 --> 00:02:58.563
Well, at 22, I was very lucky.

00:02:58.587 --> 00:03:01.344
My first job out of university

00:03:01.368 --> 00:03:05.328
was investigating the illegal
trade in African ivory.

00:03:05.352 --> 00:03:09.557
And that's how my relationship
with corruption really began.

00:03:09.581 --> 00:03:12.565
In 1993, with two friends
who were colleagues,

00:03:12.589 --> 00:03:15.368
Simon Taylor and Patrick Alley,

00:03:15.392 --> 00:03:18.969
we set up an organization
called Global Witness.

00:03:18.993 --> 00:03:21.719
Our first campaign
was investigating the role

00:03:21.743 --> 00:03:26.025
of illegal logging in funding
the war in Cambodia.

00:03:26.049 --> 00:03:29.068
So a few years later, and it's now 1997,

00:03:29.092 --> 00:03:33.829
and I'm in Angola undercover
investigating blood diamonds.

00:03:33.853 --> 00:03:35.556
Perhaps you saw the film,

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:37.247
the Hollywood film "Blood Diamond,"

00:03:37.271 --> 00:03:38.824
the one with Leonardo DiCaprio.

00:03:38.848 --> 00:03:42.279
Well, some of that sprang from our work.

00:03:42.303 --> 00:03:44.995
Luanda, it was full of land mine victims

00:03:45.019 --> 00:03:47.175
who were struggling
to survive on the streets

00:03:47.199 --> 00:03:50.263
and war orphans living
in sewers under the streets,

00:03:50.287 --> 00:03:52.352
and a tiny, very wealthy elite

00:03:52.376 --> 00:03:55.571
who gossiped about shopping
trips to Brazil and Portugal.

00:03:55.595 --> 00:03:58.332
And it was a slightly crazy place.

00:03:58.356 --> 00:04:02.016
So I'm sitting in a hot
and very stuffy hotel room

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:05.076
feeling just totally overwhelmed.

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:07.432
But it wasn't about blood diamonds.

00:04:07.456 --> 00:04:10.334
Because I'd been speaking
to lots of people there

00:04:10.358 --> 00:04:12.702
who, well, they talked
about a different problem:

00:04:12.726 --> 00:04:16.123
that of a massive web
of corruption on a global scale

00:04:16.147 --> 00:04:19.457
and millions of oil dollars going missing.

00:04:19.481 --> 00:04:21.918
And for what was then
a very small organization

00:04:21.942 --> 00:04:24.066
of just a few people,

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:26.808
trying to even begin to think
how we might tackle that

00:04:26.832 --> 00:04:29.279
was an enormous challenge.

00:04:29.303 --> 00:04:30.827
And in the years that I've been,

00:04:30.851 --> 00:04:33.382
and we've all been campaigning
and investigating,

00:04:33.405 --> 00:04:35.645
I've repeatedly seen
that what makes corruption

00:04:35.669 --> 00:04:37.913
on a global, massive scale possible,

00:04:37.937 --> 00:04:41.047
well it isn't just greed
or the misuse of power

00:04:41.071 --> 00:04:43.486
or that nebulous phrase "weak governance."

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:45.523
I mean, yes, it's all of those,

00:04:45.547 --> 00:04:48.475
but corruption, it's made
possible by the actions

00:04:48.499 --> 00:04:52.096
of global facilitators.

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:55.286
So let's go back to some of those
people I talked about earlier.

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:56.803
Now, they're all people
we've investigated,

00:04:56.827 --> 00:04:59.589
and they're all people who couldn't
do what they do alone.

00:04:59.613 --> 00:05:02.029
Take Obiang junior. Well, he didn't end up

00:05:02.053 --> 00:05:05.868
with high-end art and luxury
houses without help.

00:05:05.892 --> 00:05:08.043
He did business with global banks.

00:05:08.067 --> 00:05:11.882
A bank in Paris held accounts
of companies controlled by him,

00:05:11.906 --> 00:05:14.280
one of which was used to buy the art,

00:05:14.304 --> 00:05:16.921
and American banks, well, they funneled

00:05:16.945 --> 00:05:19.857
73 million dollars into the States,

00:05:19.881 --> 00:05:23.956
some of which was used to buy
that California mansion.

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:26.864
And he didn't do all of this
in his own name either.

00:05:26.888 --> 00:05:28.618
He used shell companies.

00:05:28.642 --> 00:05:30.952
He used one to buy
the property, and another,

00:05:30.976 --> 00:05:33.038
which was in somebody else's name,

00:05:33.062 --> 00:05:37.036
to pay the huge bills it
cost to run the place.

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:39.264
And then there's Dan Etete.

00:05:39.288 --> 00:05:41.346
Well, when he was oil minister,

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:46.476
he awarded an oil block now
worth over a billion dollars

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:49.310
to a company that, guess what, yeah,

00:05:49.334 --> 00:05:51.693
he was the hidden owner of.

00:05:51.717 --> 00:05:55.095
Now, it was then much later traded on

00:05:55.119 --> 00:05:57.691
with the kind assistance
of the Nigerian government --

00:05:57.715 --> 00:05:59.773
now I have to be careful what I say here —

00:05:59.797 --> 00:06:03.922
to subsidiaries of Shell
and the Italian Eni,

00:06:03.946 --> 00:06:06.576
two of the biggest oil companies around.

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:09.029
So the reality is,
is that the engine of corruption,

00:06:09.053 --> 00:06:11.472
well, it exists far
beyond the shores of countries

00:06:11.496 --> 00:06:14.671
like Equatorial Guinea
or Nigeria or Turkmenistan.

00:06:14.695 --> 00:06:16.995
This engine, well, it's driven

00:06:17.019 --> 00:06:19.361
by our international banking system,

00:06:19.385 --> 00:06:21.904
by the problem of anonymous
shell companies,

00:06:21.928 --> 00:06:24.286
and by the secrecy that we have afforded

00:06:24.310 --> 00:06:27.255
big oil, gas and mining operations,

00:06:27.279 --> 00:06:30.988
and, most of all, by the failure
of our politicians

00:06:31.012 --> 00:06:33.063
to back up their rhetoric and do something

00:06:33.087 --> 00:06:38.055
really meaningful and systemic
to tackle this stuff.

00:06:38.079 --> 00:06:40.066
Now let's take the banks first.

00:06:40.090 --> 00:06:42.400
Well, it's not going
to come as any surprise

00:06:42.424 --> 00:06:46.712
for me to tell you that banks
accept dirty money,

00:06:46.736 --> 00:06:51.256
but they prioritize their profits
in other destructive ways too.

00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:54.363
For example, in Sarawak, Malaysia.

00:06:54.387 --> 00:06:58.002
Now this region, it has just five percent

00:06:58.026 --> 00:07:03.418
of its forests left intact. Five percent.

00:07:03.442 --> 00:07:04.753
So how did that happen?

00:07:04.777 --> 00:07:07.809
Well, because an elite
and its facilitators

00:07:07.833 --> 00:07:09.983
have been making millions of dollars

00:07:10.007 --> 00:07:13.514
from supporting logging
on an industrial scale

00:07:13.538 --> 00:07:15.920
for many years.

00:07:15.944 --> 00:07:18.174
So we sent an undercover investigator in

00:07:18.198 --> 00:07:21.764
to secretly film meetings
with members of the ruling elite,

00:07:21.788 --> 00:07:25.095
and the resulting footage, well,
it made some people very angry,

00:07:25.119 --> 00:07:27.345
and you can see that on YouTube,

00:07:27.369 --> 00:07:29.322
but it proved what we had long suspected,

00:07:29.346 --> 00:07:32.819
because it showed
how the state's chief minister,

00:07:32.843 --> 00:07:34.729
despite his later denials,

00:07:34.753 --> 00:07:38.128
used his control over land
and forest licenses

00:07:38.152 --> 00:07:41.159
to enrich himself and his family.

00:07:41.183 --> 00:07:45.758
And HSBC, well, we know
that HSBC bankrolled

00:07:45.782 --> 00:07:47.767
the region's largest logging companies

00:07:47.791 --> 00:07:50.172
that were responsible
for some of that destruction

00:07:50.196 --> 00:07:52.759
in Sarawak and elsewhere.

00:07:52.783 --> 00:07:56.467
The bank violated its own
sustainability policies in the process,

00:07:56.491 --> 00:08:00.287
but it earned around 130 million dollars.

00:08:00.311 --> 00:08:02.623
Now shortly after our exposé,

00:08:02.647 --> 00:08:05.225
very shortly after our exposé
earlier this year,

00:08:05.249 --> 00:08:08.229
the bank announced
a policy review on this.

00:08:08.253 --> 00:08:10.815
And is this progress? Maybe,

00:08:10.839 --> 00:08:13.318
but we're going to be
keeping a very close eye

00:08:13.342 --> 00:08:15.655
on that case.

00:08:15.679 --> 00:08:19.068
And then there's the problem
of anonymous shell companies.

00:08:19.092 --> 00:08:21.897
Well, we've all heard
about what they are, I think,

00:08:21.921 --> 00:08:24.393
and we all know they're used quite a bit

00:08:24.417 --> 00:08:26.979
by people and companies
who are trying to avoid

00:08:27.003 --> 00:08:30.026
paying their proper dues to society,

00:08:30.050 --> 00:08:32.079
also known as taxes.

00:08:32.103 --> 00:08:34.988
But what doesn't usually come to light

00:08:35.012 --> 00:08:39.538
is how shell companies are used to steal

00:08:39.562 --> 00:08:42.910
huge sums of money,
transformational sums of money,

00:08:42.934 --> 00:08:44.956
from poor countries.

00:08:44.980 --> 00:08:48.376
In virtually every case of corruption
that we've investigated,

00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:50.588
shell companies have appeared,

00:08:50.612 --> 00:08:52.948
and sometimes
it's been impossible to find out

00:08:52.972 --> 00:08:56.460
who is really involved in the deal.

00:08:56.484 --> 00:08:58.788
A recent study by the World Bank

00:08:58.812 --> 00:09:01.738
looked at 200 cases of corruption.

00:09:01.762 --> 00:09:04.828
It found that over 70
percent of those cases

00:09:04.852 --> 00:09:07.782
had used anonymous shell companies,

00:09:07.806 --> 00:09:11.164
totaling almost 56 billion dollars.

00:09:11.188 --> 00:09:13.426
Now many of these
companies were in America

00:09:13.450 --> 00:09:14.736
or the United Kingdom,

00:09:14.760 --> 00:09:17.137
its overseas territories
and Crown dependencies,

00:09:17.161 --> 00:09:19.391
and so it's not just an offshore problem,

00:09:19.415 --> 00:09:21.683
it's an on-shore one too.

00:09:21.707 --> 00:09:23.822
You see, shell companies, they're central

00:09:23.846 --> 00:09:27.076
to the secret deals which may
benefit wealthy elites

00:09:27.100 --> 00:09:30.100
rather than ordinary citizens.

00:09:30.124 --> 00:09:33.346
One striking recent case
that we've investigated

00:09:33.370 --> 00:09:36.322
is how the government
in the Democratic Republic of Congo

00:09:36.346 --> 00:09:40.679
sold off a series of valuable,
state-owned mining assets

00:09:40.703 --> 00:09:44.033
to shell companies
in the British Virgin Islands.

00:09:44.057 --> 00:09:46.305
So we spoke to sources in country,

00:09:46.329 --> 00:09:49.341
trawled through company
documents and other information

00:09:49.365 --> 00:09:53.396
trying to piece together a really
true picture of the deal.

00:09:53.420 --> 00:09:56.221
And we were alarmed to find
that these shell companies

00:09:56.245 --> 00:09:58.737
had quickly flipped many of the assets on

00:09:58.761 --> 00:10:02.958
for huge profits to major
international mining companies

00:10:02.982 --> 00:10:05.321
listed in London.

00:10:05.345 --> 00:10:08.577
Now, the Africa Progress
Panel, led by Kofi Annan,

00:10:08.601 --> 00:10:11.465
they've calculated
that Congo may have lost

00:10:11.489 --> 00:10:16.569
more than 1.3 billion dollars
from these deals.

00:10:16.593 --> 00:10:18.822
That's almost twice

00:10:18.846 --> 00:10:24.462
the country's annual health
and education budget combined.

00:10:24.486 --> 00:10:27.088
And will the people of Congo,
will they ever get their money back?

00:10:27.112 --> 00:10:28.746
Well, the answer to that question,

00:10:28.770 --> 00:10:30.640
and who was really involved
and what really happened,

00:10:30.664 --> 00:10:33.143
well that's going to probably
remain locked away

00:10:33.167 --> 00:10:36.292
in the secretive company registries
of the British Virgin Islands

00:10:36.316 --> 00:10:41.126
and elsewhere unless we all do
something about it.

00:10:41.150 --> 00:10:44.113
And how about the oil, gas
and mining companies?

00:10:44.137 --> 00:10:46.827
Okay, maybe it's a bit
of a cliché to talk about them.

00:10:46.851 --> 00:10:48.947
Corruption in that sector, no surprise.

00:10:48.971 --> 00:10:53.380
There's corruption everywhere,
so why focus on that sector?

00:10:53.404 --> 00:10:55.580
Well, because there's a lot at stake.

00:10:55.604 --> 00:10:59.677
In 2011, natural resource exports

00:10:59.701 --> 00:11:03.189
outweighed aid flows by almost 19 to one

00:11:03.213 --> 00:11:07.612
in Africa, Asia and Latin America.
Nineteen to one.

00:11:07.636 --> 00:11:11.249
Now that's a hell of a lot
of schools and universities

00:11:11.273 --> 00:11:13.226
and hospitals and business startups,

00:11:13.250 --> 00:11:15.584
many of which haven't
materialized and never will

00:11:15.608 --> 00:11:19.915
because some of that money
has simply been stolen away.

00:11:19.939 --> 00:11:22.320
Now let's go back to the oil
and mining companies,

00:11:22.344 --> 00:11:25.336
and let's go back to Dan Etete
and that $1 billion deal.

00:11:25.360 --> 00:11:28.625
And now forgive me, I'm
going to read the next bit

00:11:28.649 --> 00:11:30.922
because it's a very live
issue, and our lawyers

00:11:30.946 --> 00:11:33.112
have been through this in some detail

00:11:33.136 --> 00:11:36.422
and they want me to get it right.

00:11:36.446 --> 00:11:40.595
Now, on the surface, the deal
appeared straightforward.

00:11:40.619 --> 00:11:42.695
Subsidiaries of Shell and Eni

00:11:42.719 --> 00:11:45.669
paid the Nigerian
government for the block.

00:11:45.693 --> 00:11:47.832
The Nigerian government transferred

00:11:47.856 --> 00:11:50.656
precisely the same amount,
to the very dollar,

00:11:50.680 --> 00:11:55.271
to an account earmarked
for a shell company

00:11:55.295 --> 00:11:57.397
whose hidden owner was Etete.

00:11:57.421 --> 00:12:00.786
Now, that's not bad going
for a convicted money launderer.

00:12:00.810 --> 00:12:02.243
And here's the thing.

00:12:02.267 --> 00:12:04.120
After many months of digging around

00:12:04.144 --> 00:12:07.655
and reading through hundreds
of pages of court documents,

00:12:07.679 --> 00:12:09.610
we found evidence that, in fact,

00:12:09.634 --> 00:12:13.039
Shell and Eni had known that the funds

00:12:13.063 --> 00:12:16.114
would be transferred
to that shell company,

00:12:16.138 --> 00:12:19.821
and frankly, it's hard
to believe they didn't know

00:12:19.845 --> 00:12:23.112
who they were really dealing with there.

00:12:23.136 --> 00:12:26.200
Now, it just shouldn't take
these sorts of efforts

00:12:26.224 --> 00:12:28.729
to find out where the money
in deals like this went.

00:12:28.753 --> 00:12:30.298
I mean, these are state assets.

00:12:30.322 --> 00:12:31.764
They're supposed to be
used for the benefit

00:12:31.788 --> 00:12:33.497
of the people in the country.

00:12:33.521 --> 00:12:36.686
But in some countries,
citizens and journalists

00:12:36.710 --> 00:12:38.710
who are trying to expose stories like this

00:12:38.734 --> 00:12:40.211
have been harassed and arrested

00:12:40.235 --> 00:12:44.666
and some have even risked
their lives to do so.

00:12:44.690 --> 00:12:48.470
And finally, well, there
are those who believe

00:12:48.494 --> 00:12:50.794
that corruption is unavoidable.

00:12:50.818 --> 00:12:52.943
It's just how some business is done.

00:12:52.967 --> 00:12:55.508
It's too complex and difficult to change.

00:12:55.532 --> 00:12:58.435
So in effect, what? We just accept it.

00:12:58.459 --> 00:13:00.828
But as a campaigner and investigator,

00:13:00.852 --> 00:13:01.879
I have a different view,

00:13:01.903 --> 00:13:04.049
because I've seen what can happen

00:13:04.073 --> 00:13:06.603
when an idea gains momentum.

00:13:06.627 --> 00:13:09.347
In the oil and mining sector, for example,

00:13:09.371 --> 00:13:10.610
there is now the beginning

00:13:10.634 --> 00:13:13.859
of a truly worldwide transparency standard

00:13:13.883 --> 00:13:16.879
that could tackle some of these problems.

00:13:16.903 --> 00:13:19.301
In 1999, when Global Witness called

00:13:19.325 --> 00:13:22.640
for oil companies to make
payments on deals transparent,

00:13:22.664 --> 00:13:26.429
well, some people laughed
at the extreme naiveté

00:13:26.453 --> 00:13:28.532
of that small idea.

00:13:28.556 --> 00:13:32.102
But literally hundreds
of civil society groups

00:13:32.126 --> 00:13:33.980
from around the world came together

00:13:34.004 --> 00:13:35.589
to fight for transparency,

00:13:35.613 --> 00:13:39.570
and now it's fast becoming
the norm and the law.

00:13:39.594 --> 00:13:41.542
Two thirds of the value

00:13:41.566 --> 00:13:43.862
of the world's oil and mining companies

00:13:43.886 --> 00:13:47.633
are now covered by transparency laws.
Two thirds.

00:13:47.657 --> 00:13:49.106
So this is change happening.

00:13:49.130 --> 00:13:50.996
This is progress.

00:13:51.020 --> 00:13:54.119
But we're not there yet, by far.

00:13:54.143 --> 00:13:56.365
Because it really isn't about corruption

00:13:56.389 --> 00:13:58.480
somewhere over there, is it?

00:13:58.504 --> 00:14:00.685
In a globalized world, corruption

00:14:00.709 --> 00:14:02.948
is a truly globalized business,

00:14:02.972 --> 00:14:05.063
and one that needs global solutions,

00:14:05.087 --> 00:14:09.063
supported and pushed by us
all, as global citizens,

00:14:09.087 --> 00:14:10.225
right here.

00:14:10.249 --> 00:14:11.415
Thank you.

00:14:11.439 --> 00:14:18.255
(Applause)
