00:00:12.889 --> 00:00:14.733
Where do you come from?

00:00:14.757 --> 00:00:16.804
It's such a simple question,

00:00:16.828 --> 00:00:18.987
but these days, of course,
simple questions

00:00:19.011 --> 00:00:22.033
bring ever more complicated answers.

00:00:22.057 --> 00:00:24.985
People are always asking
me where I come from,

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:28.165
and they're expecting me to say India,

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:31.266
and they're absolutely right
insofar as 100 percent

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:34.832
of my blood and ancestry
does come from India.

00:00:34.856 --> 00:00:38.897
Except, I've never lived
one day of my life there.

00:00:38.921 --> 00:00:41.305
I can't speak even one word

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:44.305
of its more than 22,000 dialects.

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:46.515
So I don't think I've really
earned the right

00:00:46.539 --> 00:00:48.961
to call myself an Indian.

00:00:48.985 --> 00:00:50.509
And if "Where do you come from?"

00:00:50.533 --> 00:00:53.576
means "Where were you born
and raised and educated?"

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:56.002
then I'm entirely
of that funny little country

00:00:56.026 --> 00:00:57.373
known as England,

00:00:57.397 --> 00:00:59.784
except I left England
as soon as I completed

00:00:59.808 --> 00:01:01.697
my undergraduate education,

00:01:01.721 --> 00:01:03.414
and all the time I was growing up,

00:01:03.438 --> 00:01:06.210
I was the only kid in all my classes

00:01:06.234 --> 00:01:09.339
who didn't begin to look
like the classic English heroes

00:01:09.363 --> 00:01:12.017
represented in our textbooks.

00:01:12.041 --> 00:01:13.319
And if "Where do you come from?"

00:01:13.343 --> 00:01:15.010
means "Where do you pay your taxes?

00:01:15.034 --> 00:01:17.558
Where do you see your doctor
and your dentist?"

00:01:17.582 --> 00:01:19.921
then I'm very much of the United States,

00:01:19.945 --> 00:01:22.489
and I have been for 48 years now,

00:01:22.513 --> 00:01:24.577
since I was a really small child.

00:01:24.601 --> 00:01:26.285
Except, for many of those years,

00:01:26.309 --> 00:01:28.786
I've had to carry around this
funny little pink card

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:30.715
with green lines running through my face

00:01:30.739 --> 00:01:33.328
identifying me as a permanent alien.

00:01:33.352 --> 00:01:37.590
I do actually feel more alien
the longer I live there.

00:01:37.614 --> 00:01:39.777
(Laughter)

00:01:39.801 --> 00:01:41.364
And if "Where do you come from?"

00:01:41.388 --> 00:01:44.130
means "Which place goes deepest inside you

00:01:44.154 --> 00:01:47.310
and where do you try
to spend most of your time?"

00:01:47.334 --> 00:01:48.483
then I'm Japanese,

00:01:48.507 --> 00:01:50.736
because I've been living as much as I can

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:54.121
for the last 25 years in Japan.

00:01:54.145 --> 00:01:57.174
Except, all of those years
I've been there on a tourist visa,

00:01:57.198 --> 00:01:59.316
and I'm fairly sure not many Japanese

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:02.207
would want to consider me one of them.

00:02:02.231 --> 00:02:05.458
And I say all this just to stress

00:02:05.482 --> 00:02:08.178
how very old-fashioned and straightforward

00:02:08.202 --> 00:02:09.177
my background is,

00:02:09.201 --> 00:02:13.225
because when I go to Hong
Kong or Sydney or Vancouver,

00:02:13.249 --> 00:02:15.121
most of the kids I meet

00:02:15.145 --> 00:02:18.920
are much more international
and multi-cultured than I am.

00:02:18.944 --> 00:02:21.585
And they have one home
associated with their parents,

00:02:21.609 --> 00:02:24.741
but another associated
with their partners,

00:02:24.765 --> 00:02:28.130
a third connected maybe with the place
where they happen to be,

00:02:28.154 --> 00:02:31.044
a fourth connected with the place
they dream of being,

00:02:31.068 --> 00:02:33.388
and many more besides.

00:02:33.412 --> 00:02:36.674
And their whole life will be
spent taking pieces

00:02:36.698 --> 00:02:40.161
of many different places
and putting them together

00:02:40.185 --> 00:02:43.003
into a stained glass whole.

00:02:43.027 --> 00:02:45.444
Home for them is really
a work in progress.

00:02:45.468 --> 00:02:48.040
It's like a project
on which they're constantly adding

00:02:48.064 --> 00:02:51.174
upgrades and improvements and corrections.

00:02:51.198 --> 00:02:53.069
And for more and more of us,

00:02:53.093 --> 00:02:57.524
home has really less to do
with a piece of soil

00:02:57.548 --> 00:03:00.275
than, you could say, with a piece of soul.

00:03:00.299 --> 00:03:02.680
If somebody suddenly asks
me, "Where's your home?"

00:03:02.704 --> 00:03:05.595
I think about my sweetheart
or my closest friends

00:03:05.619 --> 00:03:09.862
or the songs that travel with me
wherever I happen to be.

00:03:09.886 --> 00:03:11.719
And I'd always felt this way,

00:03:11.743 --> 00:03:14.462
but it really came home to me, as it were,

00:03:14.486 --> 00:03:17.180
some years ago when
I was climbing up the stairs

00:03:17.204 --> 00:03:19.882
in my parents' house in California,

00:03:19.906 --> 00:03:22.708
and I looked through the living
room windows

00:03:22.732 --> 00:03:27.886
and I saw that we were
encircled by 70-foot flames,

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:30.372
one of those wildfires
that regularly tear through

00:03:30.396 --> 00:03:34.203
the hills of California
and many other such places.

00:03:34.227 --> 00:03:37.228
And three hours later,
that fire had reduced

00:03:37.252 --> 00:03:39.972
my home and every last thing in it

00:03:39.996 --> 00:03:42.990
except for me to ash.

00:03:43.014 --> 00:03:45.700
And when I woke up the next morning,

00:03:45.724 --> 00:03:47.391
I was sleeping on a friend's floor,

00:03:47.415 --> 00:03:49.819
the only thing I had
in the world was a toothbrush

00:03:49.843 --> 00:03:52.386
I had just bought
from an all-night supermarket.

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:54.292
Of course, if anybody asked me then,

00:03:54.316 --> 00:03:55.651
"Where is your home?"

00:03:55.675 --> 00:03:59.643
I literally couldn't point
to any physical construction.

00:03:59.667 --> 00:04:04.375
My home would have to be whatever
I carried around inside me.

00:04:04.399 --> 00:04:08.367
And in so many ways, I think
this is a terrific liberation.

00:04:08.391 --> 00:04:10.561
Because when my grandparents were born,

00:04:10.585 --> 00:04:13.088
they pretty much had their sense of home,

00:04:13.112 --> 00:04:16.580
their sense of community,
even their sense of enmity,

00:04:16.604 --> 00:04:18.505
assigned to them at birth,

00:04:18.529 --> 00:04:21.483
and didn't have much chance
of stepping outside of that.

00:04:21.507 --> 00:04:25.190
And nowadays, at least some of us
can choose our sense of home,

00:04:25.214 --> 00:04:27.348
create our sense of community,

00:04:27.372 --> 00:04:30.929
fashion our sense of self, and in so doing

00:04:30.953 --> 00:04:33.066
maybe step a little beyond

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:34.852
some of the black and white divisions

00:04:34.876 --> 00:04:36.684
of our grandparents' age.

00:04:36.708 --> 00:04:38.568
No coincidence that the president

00:04:38.592 --> 00:04:41.299
of the strongest nation
on Earth is half-Kenyan,

00:04:41.323 --> 00:04:42.906
partly raised in Indonesia,

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:46.505
has a Chinese-Canadian brother-in-law.

00:04:46.529 --> 00:04:49.969
The number of people living
in countries not their own

00:04:49.993 --> 00:04:54.756
now comes to 220 million,

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:57.370
and that's an almost unimaginable number,

00:04:57.394 --> 00:05:01.120
but it means that if you took
the whole population of Canada

00:05:01.144 --> 00:05:03.036
and the whole population of Australia

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:05.346
and then the whole population
of Australia again

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:07.988
and the whole population of Canada again

00:05:08.012 --> 00:05:09.671
and doubled that number,

00:05:09.695 --> 00:05:11.838
you would still have
fewer people than belong

00:05:11.862 --> 00:05:14.045
to this great floating tribe.

00:05:14.069 --> 00:05:15.831
And the number of us who live outside

00:05:15.855 --> 00:05:19.915
the old nation-state categories
is increasing so quickly,

00:05:19.939 --> 00:05:23.545
by 64 million just in the last 12 years,

00:05:23.569 --> 00:05:27.025
that soon there will be more
of us than there are Americans.

00:05:27.049 --> 00:05:31.699
Already, we represent
the fifth-largest nation on Earth.

00:05:31.723 --> 00:05:34.555
And in fact, in Canada's largest
city, Toronto,

00:05:34.579 --> 00:05:38.245
the average resident today
is what used to be called

00:05:38.269 --> 00:05:42.337
a foreigner, somebody born
in a very different country.

00:05:42.361 --> 00:05:46.126
And I've always felt that the beauty
of being surrounded by the foreign

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:47.723
is that it slaps you awake.

00:05:47.747 --> 00:05:50.527
You can't take anything for granted.

00:05:50.551 --> 00:05:53.261
Travel, for me, is a little bit
like being in love,

00:05:53.285 --> 00:05:57.318
because suddenly all your senses
are at the setting marked "on."

00:05:57.342 --> 00:06:01.319
Suddenly you're alert to the secret
patterns of the world.

00:06:01.343 --> 00:06:05.635
The real voyage of discovery,
as Marcel Proust famously said,

00:06:05.659 --> 00:06:08.633
consists not in seeing new sights,

00:06:08.657 --> 00:06:11.003
but in looking with new eyes.

00:06:11.027 --> 00:06:12.969
And of course, once you have new eyes,

00:06:12.993 --> 00:06:15.406
even the old sights, even your home

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:18.083
become something different.

00:06:18.107 --> 00:06:20.901
Many of the people living
in countries not their own

00:06:20.925 --> 00:06:23.984
are refugees who never
wanted to leave home

00:06:24.008 --> 00:06:26.700
and ache to go back home.

00:06:26.724 --> 00:06:28.347
But for the fortunate among us,

00:06:28.371 --> 00:06:32.628
I think the age of movement brings
exhilarating new possibilities.

00:06:32.652 --> 00:06:33.693
Certainly when I'm traveling,

00:06:33.717 --> 00:06:36.007
especially to the major
cities of the world,

00:06:36.031 --> 00:06:38.132
the typical person I meet today

00:06:38.156 --> 00:06:42.677
will be, let's say, a half-Korean,
half-German young woman

00:06:42.701 --> 00:06:44.380
living in Paris.

00:06:44.404 --> 00:06:47.438
And as soon as she meets a half-Thai,

00:06:47.462 --> 00:06:50.652
half-Canadian young guy from Edinburgh,

00:06:50.676 --> 00:06:53.129
she recognizes him as kin.

00:06:53.153 --> 00:06:57.468
She realizes that she probably
has much more in common with him

00:06:57.492 --> 00:07:01.061
than with anybody entirely
of Korea or entirely of Germany.

00:07:01.085 --> 00:07:03.819
So they become friends. They fall in love.

00:07:03.843 --> 00:07:06.097
They move to New York City.

00:07:06.121 --> 00:07:08.260
(Laughter)

00:07:08.284 --> 00:07:09.646
Or Edinburgh.

00:07:09.670 --> 00:07:12.920
And the little girl
who arises out of their union

00:07:12.944 --> 00:07:15.051
will of course be not Korean or German

00:07:15.075 --> 00:07:17.594
or French or Thai or Scotch or Canadian

00:07:17.618 --> 00:07:19.699
or even American, but a wonderful

00:07:19.723 --> 00:07:23.833
and constantly evolving
mix of all those places.

00:07:23.857 --> 00:07:26.598
And potentially, everything about the way

00:07:26.622 --> 00:07:29.347
that young woman dreams about the world,

00:07:29.371 --> 00:07:32.393
writes about the world,
thinks about the world,

00:07:32.417 --> 00:07:34.363
could be something different,

00:07:34.387 --> 00:07:37.558
because it comes out of this
almost unprecedented

00:07:37.582 --> 00:07:39.531
blend of cultures.

00:07:39.555 --> 00:07:42.615
Where you come from now
is much less important

00:07:42.639 --> 00:07:44.263
than where you're going.

00:07:44.287 --> 00:07:46.659
More and more of us
are rooted in the future

00:07:46.683 --> 00:07:49.955
or the present tense
as much as in the past.

00:07:49.979 --> 00:07:52.518
And home, we know, is not just the place

00:07:52.542 --> 00:07:54.628
where you happen to be born.

00:07:54.652 --> 00:07:59.101
It's the place where you become yourself.

00:07:59.125 --> 00:08:01.523
And yet,

00:08:01.547 --> 00:08:04.188
there is one great problem with movement,

00:08:04.212 --> 00:08:07.399
and that is that it's really
hard to get your bearings

00:08:07.423 --> 00:08:09.017
when you're in midair.

00:08:09.041 --> 00:08:12.303
Some years ago, I noticed
that I had accumulated

00:08:12.327 --> 00:08:15.825
one million miles
on United Airlines alone.

00:08:15.849 --> 00:08:17.875
You all know that crazy system,

00:08:17.899 --> 00:08:21.603
six days in hell, you get
the seventh day free.

00:08:21.627 --> 00:08:25.109
(Laughter)

00:08:25.133 --> 00:08:27.385
And I began to think that really,

00:08:27.409 --> 00:08:30.664
movement was only as good
as the sense of stillness

00:08:30.688 --> 00:08:34.511
that you could bring to it
to put it into perspective.

00:08:34.535 --> 00:08:37.365
And eight months
after my house burned down,

00:08:37.389 --> 00:08:40.087
I ran into a friend who taught
at a local high school,

00:08:40.111 --> 00:08:43.619
and he said, "I've got
the perfect place for you."

00:08:43.643 --> 00:08:45.627
"Really?" I said. I'm
always a bit skeptical

00:08:45.651 --> 00:08:47.105
when people say things like that.

00:08:47.129 --> 00:08:48.475
"No, honestly," he went on,

00:08:48.499 --> 00:08:50.321
"it's only three hours away by car,

00:08:50.345 --> 00:08:51.935
and it's not very expensive,

00:08:51.959 --> 00:08:55.515
and it's probably not like anywhere
you've stayed before."

00:08:55.539 --> 00:08:59.714
"Hmm." I was beginning to get
slightly intrigued. "What is it?"

00:08:59.738 --> 00:09:02.493
"Well —" Here my friend hemmed and hawed —

00:09:02.517 --> 00:09:06.075
"Well, actually
it's a Catholic hermitage."

00:09:06.099 --> 00:09:08.041
This was the wrong answer.

00:09:08.065 --> 00:09:10.588
I had spent 15 years in Anglican schools,

00:09:10.612 --> 00:09:15.186
so I had had enough hymnals
and crosses to last me a lifetime.

00:09:15.210 --> 00:09:17.457
Several lifetimes, actually.

00:09:17.481 --> 00:09:20.015
But my friend assured me
that he wasn't Catholic,

00:09:20.039 --> 00:09:21.468
nor were most of his students,

00:09:21.492 --> 00:09:24.249
but he took his classes
there every spring.

00:09:24.273 --> 00:09:29.012
And as he had it,
even the most restless, distractible,

00:09:29.036 --> 00:09:33.046
testosterone-addled
15-year-old Californian boy

00:09:33.070 --> 00:09:36.282
only had to spend three days in silence

00:09:36.306 --> 00:09:40.536
and something in him cooled
down and cleared out.

00:09:40.560 --> 00:09:42.845
He found himself.

00:09:42.869 --> 00:09:45.584
And I thought, "Anything
that works for a 15-year-old boy

00:09:45.608 --> 00:09:46.923
ought to work for me."

00:09:46.947 --> 00:09:50.533
So I got in my car,
and I drove three hours north

00:09:50.557 --> 00:09:52.009
along the coast,

00:09:52.033 --> 00:09:54.569
and the roads grew emptier and narrower,

00:09:54.593 --> 00:09:57.333
and then I turned
onto an even narrower path,

00:09:57.357 --> 00:10:00.973
barely paved, that snaked for two miles

00:10:00.997 --> 00:10:03.496
up to the top of a mountain.

00:10:03.520 --> 00:10:06.335
And when I got out of my car,

00:10:06.359 --> 00:10:08.705
the air was pulsing.

00:10:08.729 --> 00:10:10.565
The whole place was absolutely silent,

00:10:10.589 --> 00:10:14.025
but the silence wasn't
an absence of noise.

00:10:14.049 --> 00:10:18.066
It was really a presence of a kind
of energy or quickening.

00:10:18.090 --> 00:10:21.577
And at my feet was the great,
still blue plate

00:10:21.601 --> 00:10:23.831
of the Pacific Ocean.

00:10:23.855 --> 00:10:28.265
All around me were 800
acres of wild dry brush.

00:10:28.289 --> 00:10:31.051
And I went down to the room
in which I was to be sleeping.

00:10:31.075 --> 00:10:32.776
Small but eminently comfortable,

00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:34.985
it had a bed and a rocking chair

00:10:35.009 --> 00:10:38.159
and a long desk and even longer
picture windows

00:10:38.183 --> 00:10:42.448
looking out on a small,
private, walled garden,

00:10:42.472 --> 00:10:45.648
and then 1,200 feet of golden pampas grass

00:10:45.672 --> 00:10:48.640
running down to the sea.

00:10:48.664 --> 00:10:51.809
And I sat down, and I began to write,

00:10:51.833 --> 00:10:53.313
and write, and write,

00:10:53.337 --> 00:10:56.926
even though I'd gone there
really to get away from my desk.

00:10:56.950 --> 00:11:01.420
And by the time I got up,
four hours had passed.

00:11:01.444 --> 00:11:03.549
Night had fallen,

00:11:03.573 --> 00:11:08.305
and I went out under this great
overturned saltshaker of stars,

00:11:08.329 --> 00:11:10.557
and I could see the tail lights of cars

00:11:10.581 --> 00:11:14.770
disappearing around the headlands
12 miles to the south.

00:11:14.794 --> 00:11:18.478
And it really seemed
like my concerns of the previous day

00:11:18.502 --> 00:11:20.428
vanishing.

00:11:20.452 --> 00:11:22.240
And the next day, when I woke up

00:11:22.264 --> 00:11:25.708
in the absence of telephones
and TVs and laptops,

00:11:25.732 --> 00:11:29.861
the days seemed to stretch
for a thousand hours.

00:11:29.885 --> 00:11:33.560
It was really all the freedom
I know when I'm traveling,

00:11:33.584 --> 00:11:38.174
but it also profoundly
felt like coming home.

00:11:38.198 --> 00:11:39.790
And I'm not a religious person,

00:11:39.814 --> 00:11:41.291
so I didn't go to the services.

00:11:41.315 --> 00:11:43.860
I didn't consult the monks for guidance.

00:11:43.884 --> 00:11:46.640
I just took walks along the monastery road

00:11:46.664 --> 00:11:48.989
and sent postcards to loved ones.

00:11:49.013 --> 00:11:50.823
I looked at the clouds,

00:11:50.847 --> 00:11:55.148
and I did what is hardest
of all for me to do usually,

00:11:55.172 --> 00:11:57.642
which is nothing at all.

00:11:57.666 --> 00:11:59.950
And I started to go back to this place,

00:11:59.974 --> 00:12:03.518
and I noticed that I was doing
my most important work there

00:12:03.542 --> 00:12:07.049
invisibly just by sitting still,

00:12:07.073 --> 00:12:10.174
and certainly coming
to my most critical decisions

00:12:10.198 --> 00:12:12.456
the way I never could when I was racing

00:12:12.480 --> 00:12:15.029
from the last email
to the next appointment.

00:12:15.053 --> 00:12:17.658
And I began to think that something in me

00:12:17.682 --> 00:12:19.647
had really been crying out for stillness,

00:12:19.671 --> 00:12:21.195
but of course I couldn't hear it

00:12:21.219 --> 00:12:22.981
because I was running around so much.

00:12:23.005 --> 00:12:25.634
I was like some crazy guy
who puts on a blindfold

00:12:25.658 --> 00:12:28.865
and then complains
that he can't see a thing.

00:12:28.889 --> 00:12:31.406
And I thought back
to that wonderful phrase

00:12:31.430 --> 00:12:33.778
I had learned as a boy from Seneca,

00:12:33.802 --> 00:12:37.436
in which he says, "That man is poor

00:12:37.460 --> 00:12:42.809
not who has little but who hankers
after more."

00:12:42.833 --> 00:12:44.901
And, of course, I'm not suggesting

00:12:44.925 --> 00:12:46.735
that anybody here go into a monastery.

00:12:46.759 --> 00:12:48.327
That's not the point.

00:12:48.351 --> 00:12:52.045
But I do think
it's only by stopping movement

00:12:52.069 --> 00:12:54.341
that you can see where to go.

00:12:54.365 --> 00:12:57.946
And it's only by stepping
out of your life and the world

00:12:57.970 --> 00:13:01.515
that you can see what you
most deeply care about

00:13:01.539 --> 00:13:03.921
and find a home.

00:13:03.945 --> 00:13:05.964
And I've noticed so many people now

00:13:05.988 --> 00:13:09.052
take conscious measures
to sit quietly for 30 minutes

00:13:09.076 --> 00:13:11.585
every morning just collecting themselves

00:13:11.609 --> 00:13:14.145
in one corner of the room
without their devices,

00:13:14.169 --> 00:13:16.218
or go running every evening,

00:13:16.242 --> 00:13:18.174
or leave their cell phones behind

00:13:18.198 --> 00:13:22.091
when they go to have a long
conversation with a friend.

00:13:22.115 --> 00:13:25.260
Movement is a fantastic privilege,

00:13:25.284 --> 00:13:28.617
and it allows us to do so
much that our grandparents

00:13:28.641 --> 00:13:30.738
could never have dreamed of doing.

00:13:30.762 --> 00:13:32.643
But movement, ultimately,

00:13:32.667 --> 00:13:37.184
only has a meaning if you
have a home to go back to.

00:13:37.208 --> 00:13:39.975
And home, in the end, is of course

00:13:39.999 --> 00:13:42.843
not just the place where you sleep.

00:13:42.867 --> 00:13:45.482
It's the place where you stand.

00:13:45.506 --> 00:13:46.939
Thank you.

00:13:46.963 --> 00:13:52.656
(Applause)
