WEBVTT

00:00:12.936 --> 00:00:16.907
I'm five years old, and I am very proud.

00:00:16.931 --> 00:00:20.466
My father has just built the best outhouse

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:23.056
in our little village in Ukraine.

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:26.605
Inside, it's a smelly,
gaping hole in the ground,

00:00:26.629 --> 00:00:30.611
but outside, it's pearly white formica

00:00:30.635 --> 00:00:34.239
and it literally gleams in the sun.

00:00:34.263 --> 00:00:37.796
This makes me feel so proud, so important,

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:40.836
that I appoint myself the leader
of my little group of friends

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.616
and I devise missions for us.

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:45.929
So we prowl from house to house

00:00:45.953 --> 00:00:49.296
looking for flies captured in spider webs

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.683
and we set them free.

00:00:51.707 --> 00:00:53.991
Four years earlier, when I was one,

00:00:54.015 --> 00:00:55.436
after the Chernobyl accident,

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:57.767
the rain came down black,

00:00:57.791 --> 00:00:59.967
and my sister's hair fell out in clumps,

00:00:59.991 --> 00:01:02.524
and I spent nine months in the hospital.

00:01:02.548 --> 00:01:04.076
There were no visitors allowed,

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:08.088
so my mother bribed a hospital worker.

00:01:08.112 --> 00:01:10.819
She acquired a nurse's uniform,

00:01:10.843 --> 00:01:15.164
and she snuck in every night
to sit by my side.

00:01:15.188 --> 00:01:18.224
Five years later,
an unexpected silver lining.

00:01:18.248 --> 00:01:22.326
Thanks to Chernobyl,
we get asylum in the U.S.

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.545
I am six years old, and I don't
cry when we leave home

00:01:26.569 --> 00:01:27.596
and we come to America,

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:31.344
because I expect it to be
a place filled with rare

00:01:31.368 --> 00:01:35.524
and wonderful things
like bananas and chocolate

00:01:35.548 --> 00:01:37.965
and Bazooka bubble gum,

00:01:37.989 --> 00:01:42.058
Bazooka bubble gum
with the little cartoon wrappers inside,

00:01:42.082 --> 00:01:45.175
Bazooka that we'd get
once a year in Ukraine

00:01:45.199 --> 00:01:49.211
and we'd have to chew
one piece for an entire week.

00:01:49.235 --> 00:01:51.017
So the first day we get to New York,

00:01:51.041 --> 00:01:53.250
my grandmother and I find a penny

00:01:53.274 --> 00:01:56.993
in the floor of the homeless shelter
that my family's staying in.

00:01:57.017 --> 00:01:58.528
Only, we don't know
that it's a homeless shelter.

00:01:58.552 --> 00:02:01.619
We think that it's a hotel,
a hotel with lots of rats.

00:02:01.643 --> 00:02:06.201
So we find this penny kind
of fossilized in the floor,

00:02:06.225 --> 00:02:09.197
and we think that a very wealthy
man must have left it there

00:02:09.221 --> 00:02:11.691
because regular people
don't just lose money.

00:02:11.715 --> 00:02:14.248
And I hold this penny
in the palm of my hand,

00:02:14.272 --> 00:02:16.910
and it's sticky and rusty,

00:02:16.934 --> 00:02:19.941
but it feels like I'm holding a fortune.

00:02:19.965 --> 00:02:22.251
I decide that I'm going
to get my very own piece

00:02:22.275 --> 00:02:24.066
of Bazooka bubble gum.

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:28.051
And in that moment, I feel
like a millionaire.

00:02:28.075 --> 00:02:30.361
About a year later, I get
to feel that way again

00:02:30.385 --> 00:02:33.120
when we find a bag full
of stuffed animals in the trash,

00:02:33.144 --> 00:02:34.851
and suddenly I have more toys

00:02:34.875 --> 00:02:37.595
than I've ever had in my whole life.

00:02:37.619 --> 00:02:39.980
And again, I get that feeling
when we get a knock

00:02:40.004 --> 00:02:41.957
on the door of our apartment in Brooklyn,

00:02:41.981 --> 00:02:44.266
and my sister and I find a deliveryman

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:46.819
with a box of pizza that we didn't order.

00:02:46.843 --> 00:02:50.008
So we take the pizza,
our very first pizza,

00:02:50.032 --> 00:02:52.847
and we devour slice after slice

00:02:52.871 --> 00:02:56.236
as the deliveryman stands there
and stares at us from the doorway.

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:59.236
And he tells us to pay,
but we don't speak English.

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:01.664
My mother comes out,
and he asks her for money,

00:03:01.688 --> 00:03:03.022
but she doesn't have enough.

00:03:03.046 --> 00:03:06.374
She walks 50 blocks
to and from work every day

00:03:06.398 --> 00:03:09.043
just to avoid spending money on bus fare.

00:03:09.067 --> 00:03:10.909
Then our neighbor pops her head in,

00:03:10.933 --> 00:03:13.499
and she turns red with rage
when she realizes

00:03:13.523 --> 00:03:15.845
that those immigrants from downstairs

00:03:15.869 --> 00:03:19.854
have somehow gotten
their hands on her pizza.

00:03:19.878 --> 00:03:21.410
Everyone's upset.

00:03:21.434 --> 00:03:25.251
But the pizza is delicious.

00:03:25.275 --> 00:03:31.212
It doesn't hit me until years
later just how little we had.

00:03:31.236 --> 00:03:33.526
On our 10 year anniversary
of being in the U.S.,

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:35.634
we decided to celebrate
by reserving a room

00:03:35.658 --> 00:03:38.516
at the hotel that we first stayed
in when we got to the U.S.

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:40.935
The man at the front desk
laughs, and he says,

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:43.817
"You can't reserve a room here.
This is a homeless shelter."

00:03:43.841 --> 00:03:45.954
And we were shocked.

00:03:45.978 --> 00:03:49.960
My husband Brian was also
homeless as a kid.

00:03:49.984 --> 00:03:53.050
His family lost everything, and at age 11,

00:03:53.074 --> 00:03:55.803
he had to live in motels with his dad,

00:03:55.827 --> 00:03:58.736
motels
that would round up all of their food

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:02.416
and keep it hostage until they were
able to pay the bill.

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:04.621
And one time, when he finally got his box

00:04:04.645 --> 00:04:08.217
of Frosted Flakes back, it
was crawling with roaches.

00:04:08.241 --> 00:04:10.133
But he did have one thing.

00:04:10.157 --> 00:04:12.777
He had this shoebox that he carried
with him everywhere

00:04:12.801 --> 00:04:15.240
containing nine comic books,

00:04:15.264 --> 00:04:18.386
two G.I. Joes painted
to look like Spider-Man

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:21.449
and five Gobots. And
this was his treasure.

00:04:21.473 --> 00:04:24.444
This was his own assembly of heroes

00:04:24.468 --> 00:04:26.647
that kept him from drugs and gangs

00:04:26.671 --> 00:04:29.443
and from giving up on his dreams.

00:04:29.467 --> 00:04:30.491
I'm going to tell you about one more

00:04:30.515 --> 00:04:33.282
formerly homeless member of our family.

00:04:33.306 --> 00:04:34.981
This is Scarlett.

00:04:35.005 --> 00:04:38.050
Once upon a time, Scarlet
was used as bait in dog fights.

00:04:38.074 --> 00:04:40.466
She was tied up and thrown into the ring

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:44.502
for other dogs to attack so they'd get
more aggressive before the fight.

00:04:44.526 --> 00:04:48.742
And now, these days, she eats organic food

00:04:48.766 --> 00:04:51.433
and she sleeps on an orthopedic
bed with her name on it,

00:04:51.457 --> 00:04:55.685
but when we pour water
for her in her bowl,

00:04:55.709 --> 00:04:59.674
she still looks up and she wags
her tail in gratitude.

00:04:59.698 --> 00:05:02.892
Sometimes Brian and I walk
through the park with Scarlett,

00:05:02.916 --> 00:05:05.311
and she rolls through the grass,

00:05:05.335 --> 00:05:07.712
and we just look at her

00:05:07.736 --> 00:05:09.532
and then we look at each other

00:05:09.556 --> 00:05:13.539
and we feel gratitude.

00:05:13.563 --> 00:05:17.170
We forget about all of our new
middle-class frustrations

00:05:17.194 --> 00:05:19.045
and disappointments,

00:05:19.069 --> 00:05:21.729
and we feel like millionaires.

00:05:21.753 --> 00:05:22.879
Thank you.

00:05:22.903 --> 00:05:26.896
(Applause)
