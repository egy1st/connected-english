00:00:12.486 --> 00:00:14.719
Motor racing is a funny old business.

00:00:14.743 --> 00:00:17.036
We make a new car every year,

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:19.224
and then we spend the rest of the season

00:00:19.248 --> 00:00:22.000
trying to understand
what it is we've built

00:00:22.024 --> 00:00:25.221
to make it better, to make it faster.

00:00:25.245 --> 00:00:28.496
And then the next year, we start again.

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:32.734
Now, the car you see in front
of you is quite complicated.

00:00:32.758 --> 00:00:36.353
The chassis is made
up of about 11,000 components,

00:00:36.377 --> 00:00:38.821
the engine another 6,000,

00:00:38.845 --> 00:00:41.914
the electronics
about eight and a half thousand.

00:00:41.938 --> 00:00:46.315
So there's about 25,000 things
there that can go wrong.

00:00:46.339 --> 00:00:51.141
So motor racing is very much
about attention to detail.

00:00:51.165 --> 00:00:54.404
The other thing about Formula
1 in particular

00:00:54.428 --> 00:00:56.528
is we're always changing the car.

00:00:56.552 --> 00:00:58.808
We're always trying to make it faster.

00:00:58.832 --> 00:01:01.792
So every two weeks, we will be making

00:01:01.816 --> 00:01:05.992
about 5,000 new components
to fit to the car.

00:01:06.016 --> 00:01:08.170
Five to 10 percent of the race car

00:01:08.194 --> 00:01:11.922
will be different
every two weeks of the year.

00:01:11.946 --> 00:01:14.231
So how do we do that?

00:01:14.255 --> 00:01:17.975
Well, we start our life
with the racing car.

00:01:17.999 --> 00:01:21.966
We have a lot of sensors
on the car to measure things.

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:23.848
On the race car in front of you here

00:01:23.872 --> 00:01:27.007
there are about 120 sensors
when it goes into a race.

00:01:27.031 --> 00:01:30.659
It's measuring all sorts
of things around the car.

00:01:30.683 --> 00:01:32.711
That data is logged. We're logging about

00:01:32.735 --> 00:01:36.415
500 different parameters
within the data systems,

00:01:36.439 --> 00:01:40.080
about 13,000 health parameters and events

00:01:40.104 --> 00:01:44.645
to say when things are not
working the way they should do,

00:01:44.669 --> 00:01:47.470
and we're sending that data
back to the garage

00:01:47.494 --> 00:01:52.449
using telemetry at a rate
of two to four megabits per second.

00:01:52.473 --> 00:01:55.576
So during a two-hour race,
each car will be sending

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:57.851
750 million numbers.

00:01:57.875 --> 00:02:00.994
That's twice as many numbers
as words that each of us

00:02:01.018 --> 00:02:02.625
speaks in a lifetime.

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:05.243
It's a huge amount of data.

00:02:05.267 --> 00:02:07.888
But it's not enough just
to have data and measure it.

00:02:07.912 --> 00:02:10.046
You need to be able to do
something with it.

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:12.440
So we've spent a lot of time and effort

00:02:12.464 --> 00:02:14.309
in turning the data into stories

00:02:14.333 --> 00:02:17.414
to be able to tell,
what's the state of the engine,

00:02:17.438 --> 00:02:19.686
how are the tires degrading,

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:23.434
what's the situation
with fuel consumption?

00:02:23.458 --> 00:02:26.222
So all of this is taking data

00:02:26.246 --> 00:02:30.024
and turning it into knowledge
that we can act upon.

00:02:30.048 --> 00:02:32.662
Okay, so let's have a look
at a little bit of data.

00:02:32.686 --> 00:02:34.692
Let's pick a bit of data from

00:02:34.716 --> 00:02:37.771
another three-month-old patient.

00:02:37.795 --> 00:02:41.942
This is a child, and what you're
seeing here is real data,

00:02:41.966 --> 00:02:43.919
and on the far right-hand side,

00:02:43.943 --> 00:02:46.705
where everything starts getting
a little bit catastrophic,

00:02:46.729 --> 00:02:50.090
that is the patient going
into cardiac arrest.

00:02:50.114 --> 00:02:53.322
It was deemed to be
an unpredictable event.

00:02:53.346 --> 00:02:57.111
This was a heart attack
that no one could see coming.

00:02:57.135 --> 00:02:59.661
But when we look at the information there,

00:02:59.685 --> 00:03:02.010
we can see that things
are starting to become

00:03:02.034 --> 00:03:06.039
a little fuzzy about five minutes
or so before the cardiac arrest.

00:03:06.063 --> 00:03:08.076
We can see small changes

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:10.459
in things like the heart rate moving.

00:03:10.483 --> 00:03:12.945
These were all undetected
by normal thresholds

00:03:12.969 --> 00:03:15.353
which would be applied to data.

00:03:15.377 --> 00:03:18.496
So the question is, why
couldn't we see it?

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:21.077
Was this a predictable event?

00:03:21.101 --> 00:03:24.087
Can we look more
at the patterns in the data

00:03:24.111 --> 00:03:27.467
to be able to do things better?

00:03:27.491 --> 00:03:30.117
So this is a child,

00:03:30.141 --> 00:03:33.349
about the same age
as the racing car on stage,

00:03:33.373 --> 00:03:34.979
three months old.

00:03:35.003 --> 00:03:37.584
It's a patient with a heart problem.

00:03:37.608 --> 00:03:41.052
Now, when you look at some of the data
on the screen above,

00:03:41.076 --> 00:03:45.954
things like heart rate, pulse,
oxygen, respiration rates,

00:03:45.978 --> 00:03:49.030
they're all unusual for a normal child,

00:03:49.054 --> 00:03:51.672
but they're quite normal
for the child there,

00:03:51.696 --> 00:03:55.810
and so one of the challenges
you have in health care is,

00:03:55.834 --> 00:03:58.661
how can I look at the patient
in front of me,

00:03:58.685 --> 00:04:01.708
have something which is specific for her,

00:04:01.732 --> 00:04:04.496
and be able to detect when
things start to change,

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:06.595
when things start to deteriorate?

00:04:06.619 --> 00:04:09.645
Because like a racing car, any patient,

00:04:09.669 --> 00:04:12.621
when things start to go
bad, you have a short time

00:04:12.645 --> 00:04:14.452
to make a difference.

00:04:14.476 --> 00:04:17.206
So what we did is we took a data system

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:20.337
which we run every two weeks
of the year in Formula 1

00:04:20.361 --> 00:04:23.339
and we installed it
on the hospital computers

00:04:23.363 --> 00:04:25.629
at Birmingham Children's Hospital.

00:04:25.653 --> 00:04:28.068
We streamed data
from the bedside instruments

00:04:28.092 --> 00:04:30.625
in their pediatric intensive care

00:04:30.649 --> 00:04:34.080
so that we could both look
at the data in real time

00:04:34.104 --> 00:04:36.952
and, more importantly, to store the data

00:04:36.976 --> 00:04:40.009
so that we could start to learn from it.

00:04:40.033 --> 00:04:44.393
And then, we applied an application on top

00:04:44.417 --> 00:04:47.663
which would allow us to tease
out the patterns in the data

00:04:47.687 --> 00:04:50.619
in real time so we could
see what was happening,

00:04:50.643 --> 00:04:54.332
so we could determine when
things started to change.

00:04:54.356 --> 00:04:58.195
Now, in motor racing, we're
all a little bit ambitious,

00:04:58.219 --> 00:05:00.744
audacious, a little bit
arrogant sometimes,

00:05:00.768 --> 00:05:04.142
so we decided we would also
look at the children

00:05:04.166 --> 00:05:07.099
as they were being transported
to intensive care.

00:05:07.123 --> 00:05:09.647
Why should we wait
until they arrived in the hospital

00:05:09.671 --> 00:05:11.247
before we started to look?

00:05:11.271 --> 00:05:14.244
And so we installed a real-time link

00:05:14.268 --> 00:05:17.080
between the ambulance and the hospital,

00:05:17.104 --> 00:05:20.856
just using normal 3G
telephony to send that data

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:23.343
so that the ambulance became an extra bed

00:05:23.367 --> 00:05:26.479
in intensive care.

00:05:26.503 --> 00:05:30.181
And then we started looking at the data.

00:05:30.205 --> 00:05:33.102
So the wiggly lines
at the top, all the colors,

00:05:33.126 --> 00:05:36.296
this is the normal sort of data
you would see on a monitor --

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:40.068
heart rate, pulse,
oxygen within the blood,

00:05:40.092 --> 00:05:42.703
and respiration.

00:05:42.727 --> 00:05:45.456
The lines on the bottom,
the blue and the red,

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:46.957
these are the interesting ones.

00:05:46.981 --> 00:05:50.025
The red line is showing
an automated version

00:05:50.049 --> 00:05:51.622
of the early warning score

00:05:51.646 --> 00:05:54.361
that Birmingham Children's Hospital
were already running.

00:05:54.385 --> 00:05:56.447
They'd been running that since 2008,

00:05:56.471 --> 00:05:58.703
and already have stopped cardiac arrests

00:05:58.727 --> 00:06:01.460
and distress within the hospital.

00:06:01.484 --> 00:06:03.892
The blue line is an indication

00:06:03.916 --> 00:06:06.392
of when patterns start to change,

00:06:06.416 --> 00:06:08.701
and immediately, before we even started

00:06:08.725 --> 00:06:10.409
putting in clinical interpretation,

00:06:10.433 --> 00:06:13.279
we can see that the data
is speaking to us.

00:06:13.303 --> 00:06:16.815
It's telling us that something
is going wrong.

00:06:16.839 --> 00:06:20.631
The plot with the red and the green blobs,

00:06:20.655 --> 00:06:23.436
this is plotting different components

00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:25.983
of the data against each other.

00:06:26.007 --> 00:06:29.823
The green is us learning
what is normal for that child.

00:06:29.847 --> 00:06:32.433
We call it the cloud of normality.

00:06:32.457 --> 00:06:34.674
And when things start to change,

00:06:34.698 --> 00:06:37.238
when conditions start to deteriorate,

00:06:37.262 --> 00:06:39.476
we move into the red line.

00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:41.133
There's no rocket science here.

00:06:41.157 --> 00:06:45.246
It is displaying data that exists
already in a different way,

00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:48.637
to amplify it, to provide
cues to the doctors,

00:06:48.661 --> 00:06:51.375
to the nurses, so they can
see what's happening.

00:06:51.399 --> 00:06:54.505
In the same way that a good racing driver

00:06:54.529 --> 00:06:58.549
relies on cues to decide
when to apply the brakes,

00:06:58.573 --> 00:07:00.025
when to turn into a corner,

00:07:00.049 --> 00:07:02.943
we need to help
our physicians and our nurses

00:07:02.967 --> 00:07:06.563
to see when things
are starting to go wrong.

00:07:06.587 --> 00:07:09.509
So we have a very ambitious program.

00:07:09.533 --> 00:07:14.245
We think that the race is on to do
something differently.

00:07:14.269 --> 00:07:17.149
We are thinking big.
It's the right thing to do.

00:07:17.173 --> 00:07:20.561
We have an approach which,
if it's successful,

00:07:20.585 --> 00:07:23.205
there's no reason why it
should stay within a hospital.

00:07:23.229 --> 00:07:24.933
It can go beyond the walls.

00:07:24.957 --> 00:07:27.004
With wireless connectivity these days,

00:07:27.028 --> 00:07:30.448
there is no reason why
patients, doctors and nurses

00:07:30.472 --> 00:07:32.619
always have to be in the same place

00:07:32.643 --> 00:07:34.612
at the same time.

00:07:34.636 --> 00:07:38.607
And meanwhile, we'll take
our little three-month-old baby,

00:07:38.631 --> 00:07:42.364
keep taking it to the track,
keeping it safe,

00:07:42.388 --> 00:07:44.697
and making it faster and better.

00:07:44.721 --> 00:07:46.102
Thank you very much.

00:07:46.126 --> 00:07:51.080
(Applause)
