WEBVTT

00:00:12.972 --> 00:00:16.407
So over the long course of human history,

00:00:16.407 --> 00:00:18.899
the infectious disease that's killed more humans

00:00:18.899 --> 00:00:21.385
than any other is malaria.

00:00:21.385 --> 00:00:24.246
It's carried in the bites of infected mosquitos,

00:00:24.246 --> 00:00:26.455
and it's probably our oldest scourge.

00:00:26.455 --> 00:00:30.342
We may have had malaria since we evolved from the apes.

00:00:30.342 --> 00:00:33.944
And to this day, malaria takes a huge toll on our species.

00:00:33.944 --> 00:00:36.395
We've got 300 million cases a year

00:00:36.395 --> 00:00:39.387
and over half a million deaths.

00:00:39.387 --> 00:00:42.352
Now this really makes no sense.

00:00:42.352 --> 00:00:45.004
We've known how to cure malaria

00:00:45.004 --> 00:00:46.644
since the 1600s.

00:00:46.644 --> 00:00:48.941
That's when Jesuit missionaries in Peru

00:00:48.941 --> 00:00:51.843
discovered the bark of the cinchona tree,

00:00:51.843 --> 00:00:53.716
and inside that bark was quinine,

00:00:53.716 --> 00:00:57.054
still an effective cure for malaria to this day.

00:00:57.054 --> 00:00:59.955
So we've known how to cure malaria for centuries.

00:00:59.955 --> 00:01:03.139
We've known how to prevent malaria since 1897.

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:05.412
That's when the British army surgeon Ronald Ross

00:01:05.412 --> 00:01:08.770
discovered that it was mosquitos that carried malaria,

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:12.962
not bad air or miasmas, as was previously thought.

00:01:12.962 --> 00:01:18.245
So malaria should be a relatively simple disease to solve,

00:01:18.245 --> 00:01:22.175
and yet to this day, hundreds of thousands of people

00:01:22.175 --> 00:01:25.650
are going to die from the bite of a mosquito.

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:26.895
Why is that?

00:01:26.895 --> 00:01:28.425
This is a question that's

00:01:28.425 --> 00:01:30.580
personally intrigued me for a long time.

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:33.339
I grew up as the daughter of Indian immigrants

00:01:33.339 --> 00:01:35.598
visiting my cousins in India every summer,

00:01:35.598 --> 00:01:38.786
and because I had no immunity to the local malarias,

00:01:38.786 --> 00:01:43.020
I was made to sleep under this hot, sweaty mosquito net every night

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:44.711
while my cousins, they were allowed to sleep

00:01:44.711 --> 00:01:45.940
out on the terrace and have

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:48.702
this nice, cool night breeze wafting over them.

00:01:48.702 --> 00:01:52.226
And I really hated the mosquitos for that.

00:01:52.226 --> 00:01:55.594
But at the same time, I come from a Jain family,

00:01:55.594 --> 00:01:57.908
and Jainism is a religion that espouses

00:01:57.908 --> 00:02:01.046
a very extreme form of nonviolence.

00:02:01.046 --> 00:02:04.374
So Jains are not supposed to eat meat.

00:02:04.374 --> 00:02:06.231
We're not supposed to walk on grass,

00:02:06.231 --> 00:02:07.492
because you could, you know,

00:02:07.492 --> 00:02:09.392
inadvertently kill some insects when you walk on grass.

00:02:09.392 --> 00:02:12.169
We're certainly not supposed to swat mosquitos.

00:02:12.169 --> 00:02:15.885
So the fearsome power of this little insect

00:02:15.885 --> 00:02:17.864
was apparent to me from a very young age,

00:02:17.864 --> 00:02:21.135
and it's one reason why I spent five years as a journalist

00:02:21.135 --> 00:02:23.823
trying to understand, why has malaria

00:02:23.823 --> 00:02:28.363
been such a horrible scourge for all of us for so very long?

00:02:28.363 --> 00:02:31.020
And I think there's three main reasons why.

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:33.488
Those three reasons add up to the fourth reason,

00:02:33.488 --> 00:02:36.299
which is probably the biggest reason of all.

00:02:36.299 --> 00:02:39.260
The first reason is certainly scientific.

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.575
This little parasite that causes malaria,

00:02:41.575 --> 00:02:43.502
it's probably one of the most complex

00:02:43.502 --> 00:02:46.093
and wily pathogens known to humankind.

00:02:46.093 --> 00:02:49.433
It lives half its life inside the cold-blooded mosquito

00:02:49.433 --> 00:02:53.835
and half its life inside the warm-blooded human.

00:02:53.835 --> 00:02:56.833
These two environments are totally different,

00:02:56.833 --> 00:02:59.849
but not only that, they're both utterly hostile.

00:02:59.849 --> 00:03:03.856
So the insect is continually trying to fight off the parasite,

00:03:03.856 --> 00:03:06.817
and so is the human body continually trying to fight it off.

00:03:06.817 --> 00:03:10.567
This little creature survives under siege like that,

00:03:10.567 --> 00:03:13.642
but not only does it survive, it has thrived.

00:03:13.642 --> 00:03:17.964
It has spread. It has more ways to evade attack than we know.

00:03:17.964 --> 00:03:20.078
It's a shape-shifter, for one thing.

00:03:20.078 --> 00:03:23.237
Just as a caterpillar turns into a butterfly,

00:03:23.237 --> 00:03:25.876
the malaria parasite transforms itself like that

00:03:25.876 --> 00:03:29.099
seven times in its life cycle.

00:03:29.099 --> 00:03:33.356
And each of those life stages not only looks totally different from each other,

00:03:33.356 --> 00:03:36.420
they have totally different physiology.

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:38.412
So say you came up with some great drug

00:03:38.412 --> 00:03:41.352
that worked against one stage of the parasite's life cycle.

00:03:41.352 --> 00:03:44.817
It might do nothing at all to any of the other stages.

00:03:44.817 --> 00:03:47.680
It can hide in our bodies, undetected,

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:50.044
unbeknownst to us, for days, for weeks,

00:03:50.044 --> 00:03:53.843
for months, for years, in some cases even decades.

00:03:53.843 --> 00:03:58.227
So the parasite is a very big scientific challenge to tackle,

00:03:58.227 --> 00:04:01.432
but so is the mosquito that carries the parasite.

00:04:01.432 --> 00:04:03.730
Only about 12 species of mosquitos

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:05.664
carry most of the world's malaria,

00:04:05.664 --> 00:04:08.140
and we know quite a bit about the kinds of

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:11.065
watery habitats that they specialize in.

00:04:11.065 --> 00:04:13.347
So you might think, then, well, why don't we just

00:04:13.347 --> 00:04:16.503
avoid the places where the killer mosquitos live? Right?

00:04:16.503 --> 00:04:18.781
We could avoid the places where the killer grizzly bears live

00:04:18.781 --> 00:04:21.540
and we avoid the places where the killer crocodiles live.

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:24.770
But say you live in the tropics

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:28.043
and you walk outside your hut one day

00:04:28.043 --> 00:04:30.065
and you leave some footprints in the soft dirt

00:04:30.065 --> 00:04:31.988
around your home.

00:04:31.988 --> 00:04:35.218
Or say your cow does, or say your pig does,

00:04:35.218 --> 00:04:37.352
and then, say, it rains,

00:04:37.352 --> 00:04:39.720
and that footprint fills up with a little bit of water.

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:41.801
That's it. You've created the perfect

00:04:41.801 --> 00:04:45.379
malarial mosquito habitat that's right outside your door.

00:04:45.379 --> 00:04:48.241
So it's not easy for us to extricate ourselves from these insects.

00:04:48.241 --> 00:04:50.875
We kind of create places that they love to live

00:04:50.875 --> 00:04:52.874
just by living our own lives.

00:04:52.874 --> 00:04:54.253
So there's a huge scientific challenge,

00:04:54.253 --> 00:04:56.460
but there's a huge economic challenge too.

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:58.395
Malaria occurs in some of the poorest

00:04:58.395 --> 00:05:00.334
and most remote places on Earth,

00:05:00.334 --> 00:05:02.179
and there's a reason for that.

00:05:02.179 --> 00:05:04.879
If you're poor, you're more likely to get malaria.

00:05:04.879 --> 00:05:07.032
If you're poor, you're more likely to live

00:05:07.032 --> 00:05:11.101
in rudimentary housing on marginal land that's poorly drained.

00:05:11.101 --> 00:05:13.690
These are places where mosquitos breed.

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:17.290
You're less likely to have door screens or window screens.

00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:19.193
You're less likely to have electricity

00:05:19.193 --> 00:05:22.199
and all the indoor activities that electricity makes possible,

00:05:22.199 --> 00:05:23.432
so you're outside more.

00:05:23.432 --> 00:05:25.764
You're getting bitten by mosquitos more.

00:05:25.764 --> 00:05:27.389
So poverty causes malaria,

00:05:27.389 --> 00:05:30.422
but what we also know now is that malaria itself

00:05:30.422 --> 00:05:32.069
causes poverty.

00:05:32.069 --> 00:05:34.720
For one thing, it strikes hardest during harvest season,

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:37.476
so exactly when farmers need to be out in the fields

00:05:37.476 --> 00:05:41.385
collecting their crops, they're home sick with a fever.

00:05:41.385 --> 00:05:44.246
But it also predisposes people to death

00:05:44.246 --> 00:05:46.031
from all other causes.

00:05:46.031 --> 00:05:47.391
So this has happened historically.

00:05:47.391 --> 00:05:50.773
We've been able to take malaria out of a society.

00:05:50.773 --> 00:05:52.230
Everything else stays the same,

00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:54.905
so we still have bad food, bad water, bad sanitation,

00:05:54.905 --> 00:05:56.666
all the things that make people sick.

00:05:56.666 --> 00:05:58.810
But just if you take malaria out,

00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:02.622
deaths from everything else go down.

00:06:02.622 --> 00:06:05.333
And the economist Jeff Sachs has actually quantified

00:06:05.333 --> 00:06:07.518
what this means for a society.

00:06:07.518 --> 00:06:10.272
What it means is, if you have malaria in your society,

00:06:10.272 --> 00:06:12.733
your economic growth is depressed

00:06:12.733 --> 00:06:16.703
by 1.3 percent every year,

00:06:16.703 --> 00:06:20.502
year after year after year, just this one disease alone.

00:06:20.502 --> 00:06:23.066
So this poses a huge economic challenge,

00:06:23.066 --> 00:06:25.250
because say you do come up with your great drug

00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:27.460
or your great vaccine -- how do you deliver it

00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:30.030
in a place where there's no roads,

00:06:30.030 --> 00:06:31.223
there's no infrastructure,

00:06:31.223 --> 00:06:34.557
there's no electricity for refrigeration to keep things cold,

00:06:34.557 --> 00:06:37.277
there's no clinics, there's no clinicians

00:06:37.277 --> 00:06:39.811
to deliver these things where they're needed?

00:06:39.811 --> 00:06:43.814
So there's a huge economic challenge in taming malaria.

00:06:43.814 --> 00:06:46.870
But along with the scientific challenge and the economic challenge,

00:06:46.870 --> 00:06:48.682
there's also a cultural challenge,

00:06:48.682 --> 00:06:52.067
and this is probably the part about malaria

00:06:52.067 --> 00:06:54.368
that people don't like to talk about.

00:06:54.368 --> 00:06:57.079
And it's the paradox that the people

00:06:57.079 --> 00:06:58.887
who have the most malaria in the world

00:06:58.887 --> 00:07:01.467
tend to care about it the least.

00:07:01.467 --> 00:07:04.879
This has been the finding of medical anthropologists again and again.

00:07:04.879 --> 00:07:07.646
They ask people in malarious parts of the world,

00:07:07.646 --> 00:07:09.702
"What do you think about malaria?"

00:07:09.702 --> 00:07:13.611
And they don't say, "It's a killer disease. We're scared of it."

00:07:13.611 --> 00:07:18.949
They say, "Malaria is a normal problem of life."

00:07:18.949 --> 00:07:20.715
And that was certainly my personal experience.

00:07:20.715 --> 00:07:22.734
When I told my relatives in India

00:07:22.734 --> 00:07:24.218
that I was writing a book about malaria,

00:07:24.218 --> 00:07:26.185
they kind of looked at me like

00:07:26.185 --> 00:07:28.886
I told them I was writing a book about warts or something.

00:07:28.886 --> 00:07:31.933
Like, why would you write about something so boring,

00:07:31.933 --> 00:07:33.599
so ordinary? You know?

00:07:33.599 --> 00:07:36.327
And it's simple risk perception, really.

00:07:36.327 --> 00:07:38.762
A child in Malawi, for example,

00:07:38.762 --> 00:07:43.574
she might have 12 episodes of malaria before the age of two,

00:07:43.574 --> 00:07:45.627
but if she survives,

00:07:45.627 --> 00:07:48.241
she'll continue to get malaria throughout her life,

00:07:48.241 --> 00:07:50.964
but she's much less likely to die of it.

00:07:50.964 --> 00:07:52.916
And so in her lived experience,

00:07:52.916 --> 00:07:56.247
malaria is something that comes and goes.

00:07:56.247 --> 00:07:58.277
And that's actually true for most of the world's malaria.

00:07:58.277 --> 00:08:01.854
Most of the world's malaria comes and goes on its own.

00:08:01.854 --> 00:08:04.978
It's just, there's so much malaria

00:08:04.978 --> 00:08:08.749
that this tiny fraction of cases that end in death

00:08:08.749 --> 00:08:11.710
add up to this big, huge number.

00:08:11.710 --> 00:08:13.703
So I think people in malarious parts of the world

00:08:13.703 --> 00:08:15.225
must think of malaria the way

00:08:15.225 --> 00:08:16.884
those of us who live in the temperate world

00:08:16.884 --> 00:08:19.135
think of cold and flu. Right?

00:08:19.135 --> 00:08:22.541
Cold and flu have a huge burden on our societies

00:08:22.541 --> 00:08:24.222
and on our own lives,

00:08:24.222 --> 00:08:25.486
but we don't really even take

00:08:25.486 --> 00:08:28.028
the most rudimentary precautions against it because

00:08:28.028 --> 00:08:30.749
we consider it normal to get cold and flu

00:08:30.749 --> 00:08:32.986
during cold and flu season.

00:08:32.986 --> 00:08:37.398
And so this poses a huge cultural challenge in taming malaria,

00:08:37.398 --> 00:08:41.172
because if people think it's normal to have malaria,

00:08:41.172 --> 00:08:44.630
then how do you get them to run to the doctor

00:08:44.630 --> 00:08:47.776
to get diagnosed, to pick up their prescription,

00:08:47.776 --> 00:08:49.298
to get it filled, to take the drugs,

00:08:49.298 --> 00:08:52.777
to put on the repellents, to tuck in the bed nets?

00:08:52.777 --> 00:08:57.444
This is a huge cultural challenge in taming this disease.

00:08:57.444 --> 00:08:58.946
So take all that together.

00:08:58.946 --> 00:09:03.398
We've got a disease. It's scientifically complicated,

00:09:03.398 --> 00:09:05.826
it's economically challenging to deal with,

00:09:05.826 --> 00:09:07.471
and it's one for which the people who stand

00:09:07.471 --> 00:09:09.775
to benefit the most care about it the least.

00:09:09.775 --> 00:09:11.863
And that adds up to the biggest problem of all,

00:09:11.863 --> 00:09:14.812
which, of course, is the political problem.

00:09:14.812 --> 00:09:17.670
How do you get a political leader to do anything

00:09:17.670 --> 00:09:19.731
about a problem like this?

00:09:19.731 --> 00:09:24.356
And the answer is, historically, you don't.

00:09:24.356 --> 00:09:26.489
Most malarious societies throughout history

00:09:26.489 --> 00:09:28.605
have simply lived with the disease.

00:09:28.605 --> 00:09:30.608
So the main attacks on malaria have come

00:09:30.608 --> 00:09:33.232
from outside of malarious societies,

00:09:33.232 --> 00:09:35.026
from people who aren't constrained

00:09:35.026 --> 00:09:38.005
by these rather paralyzing politics.

00:09:38.005 --> 00:09:41.300
But this, I think, introduces a whole host of other kinds of difficulties.

00:09:41.300 --> 00:09:43.720
The first concerted attack against malaria

00:09:43.720 --> 00:09:45.466
started in the 1950s.

00:09:45.466 --> 00:09:48.556
It was the brainchild of the U.S. State Department.

00:09:48.556 --> 00:09:51.593
And this effort well understood the economic challenge.

00:09:51.593 --> 00:09:55.074
They knew they had to focus on cheap, easy-to-use tools,

00:09:55.074 --> 00:09:56.849
and they focused on DDT.

00:09:56.849 --> 00:09:58.288
They understood the cultural challenge.

00:09:58.288 --> 00:10:01.293
In fact, their rather patronizing view was that

00:10:01.293 --> 00:10:04.196
people at risk of malaria shouldn't be asked to do anything at all.

00:10:04.196 --> 00:10:07.918
Everything should be done to them and for them.

00:10:07.918 --> 00:10:11.038
But they greatly underestimated the scientific challenge.

00:10:11.038 --> 00:10:13.365
They had so much faith in their tools

00:10:13.365 --> 00:10:16.356
that they stopped doing malaria research.

00:10:16.356 --> 00:10:18.824
And so when those tools started to fail,

00:10:18.824 --> 00:10:21.524
and public opinion started to turn against those tools,

00:10:21.524 --> 00:10:25.718
they had no scientific expertise to figure out what to do.

00:10:25.718 --> 00:10:29.169
The whole campaign crashed, malaria resurged back,

00:10:29.169 --> 00:10:30.983
but now it was even worse than before

00:10:30.983 --> 00:10:33.744
because it was corralled into the hardest-to-reach places

00:10:33.744 --> 00:10:36.930
in the most difficult-to-control forms.

00:10:36.930 --> 00:10:40.229
One WHO official at the time actually called that whole campaign

00:10:40.229 --> 00:10:45.286
"one of the greatest mistakes ever made in public health."

00:10:45.286 --> 00:10:47.793
The latest effort to tame malaria started in the late 1990s.

00:10:47.793 --> 00:10:51.505
It's similarly directed and financed primarily

00:10:51.505 --> 00:10:53.653
from outside of malarious societies.

00:10:53.653 --> 00:10:56.157
Now this effort well understands the scientific challenge.

00:10:56.157 --> 00:10:58.378
They are doing tons of malaria research.

00:10:58.378 --> 00:11:00.831
And they understand the economic challenge too.

00:11:00.831 --> 00:11:04.391
They're focusing on very cheap, very easy-to-use tools.

00:11:04.391 --> 00:11:08.283
But now, I think, the dilemma is the cultural challenge.

00:11:08.283 --> 00:11:11.917
The centerpiece of the current effort is the bed net.

00:11:11.917 --> 00:11:13.693
It's treated with insecticides.

00:11:13.693 --> 00:11:16.063
This thing has been distributed across the malarious world

00:11:16.063 --> 00:11:17.496
by the millions.

00:11:17.496 --> 00:11:19.728
And when you think about the bed net,

00:11:19.728 --> 00:11:22.287
it's sort of a surgical intervention.

00:11:22.287 --> 00:11:24.433
You know, it doesn't really have any value

00:11:24.433 --> 00:11:28.096
to a family with malaria except that it helps prevent malaria.

00:11:28.096 --> 00:11:32.105
And yet we're asking people to use these nets every night.

00:11:32.105 --> 00:11:33.382
They have to sleep under them every night.

00:11:33.382 --> 00:11:35.419
That's the only way they are effective.

00:11:35.419 --> 00:11:36.772
And they have to do that

00:11:36.772 --> 00:11:39.858
even if the net blocks the breeze,

00:11:39.858 --> 00:11:43.003
even if they might have to get up in the middle of the night

00:11:43.003 --> 00:11:44.537
and relieve themselves,

00:11:44.537 --> 00:11:46.786
even if they might have to move all their furnishings

00:11:46.786 --> 00:11:48.253
to put this thing up,

00:11:48.253 --> 00:11:51.106
even if, you know, they might live in a round hut

00:11:51.106 --> 00:11:54.843
in which it's difficult to string up a square net.

00:11:54.843 --> 00:11:59.781
Now that's no big deal if you're fighting a killer disease.

00:11:59.781 --> 00:12:02.112
I mean, these are minor inconveniences.

00:12:02.112 --> 00:12:05.951
But that's not how people with malaria think of malaria.

00:12:05.951 --> 00:12:10.831
So for them, the calculus must be quite different.

00:12:10.831 --> 00:12:14.749
Imagine, for example, if a bunch of well-meaning Kenyans

00:12:14.749 --> 00:12:16.830
came up to those of us in the temperate world and said,

00:12:16.830 --> 00:12:19.652
"You know, you people have a lot of cold and flu.

00:12:19.652 --> 00:12:22.780
We've designed this great, easy-to-use, cheap tool,

00:12:22.780 --> 00:12:23.850
we're going to give it to you for free.

00:12:23.850 --> 00:12:25.283
It's called a face mask,

00:12:25.283 --> 00:12:29.156
and all you need to do is

00:12:29.156 --> 00:12:31.566
wear it every day during cold and flu season

00:12:31.566 --> 00:12:34.320
when you go to school and when you go to work."

00:12:34.335 --> 00:12:36.265
Would we do that?

00:12:36.265 --> 00:12:38.401
And I wonder if that's how people

00:12:38.401 --> 00:12:40.467
in the malarious world thought of those nets

00:12:40.467 --> 00:12:42.170
when they first received them?

00:12:42.170 --> 00:12:45.568
Indeed, we know from studies

00:12:45.568 --> 00:12:48.246
that only 20 percent of the bed nets

00:12:48.246 --> 00:12:51.414
that were first distributed were actually used.

00:12:51.414 --> 00:12:53.125
And even that's probably an overestimate,

00:12:53.125 --> 00:12:55.547
because the same people who distributed the nets

00:12:55.547 --> 00:12:57.038
went back and asked the recipients,

00:12:57.038 --> 00:12:59.511
"Oh, did you use that net I gave you?"

00:12:59.511 --> 00:13:02.123
Which is like your Aunt Jane asking you,

00:13:02.123 --> 00:13:05.084
"Oh, did you use that vase I gave you for Christmas?"

00:13:05.084 --> 00:13:06.950
So it's probably an overestimate.

00:13:06.950 --> 00:13:10.274
But that's not an insurmountable problem.

00:13:10.274 --> 00:13:12.104
We can do more education,

00:13:12.104 --> 00:13:14.779
we can try to convince these people to use the nets.

00:13:14.779 --> 00:13:16.054
And that's what happening now.

00:13:16.054 --> 00:13:17.758
We're throwing a lot more time and money

00:13:17.758 --> 00:13:22.275
into workshops and trainings and musicals and plays

00:13:22.275 --> 00:13:24.688
and school meetings,

00:13:24.688 --> 00:13:26.983
all these things to convince people

00:13:26.983 --> 00:13:29.467
to use the nets we gave you.

00:13:29.467 --> 00:13:31.607
And that might work.

00:13:31.607 --> 00:13:34.285
But it takes time. It takes money.

00:13:34.285 --> 00:13:37.065
It takes resources. It takes infrastructure.

00:13:37.065 --> 00:13:39.747
It takes all the things that that cheap,

00:13:39.747 --> 00:13:42.526
easy-to-use bed net was not supposed to be.

00:13:42.526 --> 00:13:45.930
So it's difficult to attack malaria from inside malarious societies,

00:13:45.930 --> 00:13:48.468
but it's equally tricky when we try to attack it

00:13:48.468 --> 00:13:51.278
from outside of those societies.

00:13:51.278 --> 00:13:53.065
We end up imposing our own priorities

00:13:53.065 --> 00:13:54.609
on the people of the malarious world.

00:13:54.609 --> 00:13:57.403
That's exactly what we did in the 1950s,

00:13:57.403 --> 00:13:59.281
and that effort backfired.

00:13:59.281 --> 00:14:00.912
I would argue today,

00:14:00.912 --> 00:14:05.142
when we are distributing tools that we've designed

00:14:05.142 --> 00:14:08.895
and that don't necessarily make sense in people's lives,

00:14:08.895 --> 00:14:12.448
we run the risk of making the same mistake again.

00:14:12.448 --> 00:14:14.256
That's not to say that malaria is unconquerable,

00:14:14.256 --> 00:14:15.719
because I think it is,

00:14:15.719 --> 00:14:17.927
but what if we attacked this disease

00:14:17.927 --> 00:14:21.470
according to the priorities of the people who lived with it?

00:14:21.470 --> 00:14:23.906
Take the example of England and the United States.

00:14:23.906 --> 00:14:27.077
We had malaria in those countries for hundreds of years,

00:14:27.077 --> 00:14:29.235
and we got rid of it completely,

00:14:29.235 --> 00:14:32.244
not because we attacked malaria. We didn't.

00:14:32.244 --> 00:14:36.351
We attacked bad roads and bad houses

00:14:36.351 --> 00:14:41.233
and bad drainage and lack of electricity and rural poverty.

00:14:41.233 --> 00:14:44.550
We attacked the malarious way of life,

00:14:44.550 --> 00:14:50.270
and by doing that, we slowly built malaria out.

00:14:50.270 --> 00:14:51.908
Now attacking the malarious way of life,

00:14:51.908 --> 00:14:55.470
this is something -- these are things people care about today.

00:14:55.470 --> 00:14:57.857
And attacking the malarious way of life,

00:14:57.857 --> 00:15:02.616
it's not fast, it's not cheap, it's not easy,

00:15:02.616 --> 00:15:05.684
but I think it's the only lasting way forward.

00:15:05.684 --> 00:15:06.977
Thank you so much.

00:15:06.977 --> 00:15:12.424
