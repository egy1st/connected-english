WEBVTT

00:00:12.435 --> 00:00:15.510
Throughout my career, I've been fortunate enough

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:16.869
to work with many of the great

00:00:16.869 --> 00:00:18.595
international architects,

00:00:18.595 --> 00:00:21.019
documenting their work and observing

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:22.978
how their designs have the capacity

00:00:22.978 --> 00:00:25.947
to influence the cities in which they sit.

00:00:25.947 --> 00:00:28.790
I think of new cities like Dubai

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:31.267
or ancient cities like Rome

00:00:31.267 --> 00:00:34.629
with Zaha Hadid's incredible MAXXI museum,

00:00:34.629 --> 00:00:37.446
or like right here in New York with the High Line,

00:00:37.446 --> 00:00:40.017
a city which has been so much influenced

00:00:40.017 --> 00:00:41.720
by the development of this.

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:43.795
But what I find really fascinating

00:00:43.795 --> 00:00:46.891
is what happens when architects and planners leave

00:00:46.891 --> 00:00:50.010
and these places become appropriated by people,

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.350
like here in Chandigarh, India,

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.670
the city which has been completely designed

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:56.809
by the architect Le Corbusier.

00:00:56.809 --> 00:00:59.789
Now 60 years later, the city has been taken over

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:01.410
by people in very different ways

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.732
from whatever perhaps intended for,

00:01:04.732 --> 00:01:07.038
like here, where you have the people

00:01:07.038 --> 00:01:10.001
sitting in the windows of the assembly hall.

00:01:10.001 --> 00:01:12.088
But over the course of several years,

00:01:12.088 --> 00:01:14.506
I've been documenting Rem Koolhaas's

00:01:14.506 --> 00:01:16.552
CCTV building in Beijing

00:01:16.552 --> 00:01:19.390
and the olympic stadium in the same city

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:22.534
by the architects Herzog and de Meuron.

00:01:22.534 --> 00:01:25.979
At these large-scale construction sites in China,

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.102
you see a sort of makeshift camp

00:01:28.102 --> 00:01:32.292
where workers live during the entire building process.

00:01:32.292 --> 00:01:34.774
As the length of the construction takes years,

00:01:34.774 --> 00:01:37.532
workers end up forming a rather rough-and-ready

00:01:37.532 --> 00:01:40.798
informal city, making for quite a juxtaposition

00:01:40.798 --> 00:01:44.241
against the sophisticated structures that they're building.

00:01:44.241 --> 00:01:46.450
Over the past seven years, I've been following

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:49.121
my fascination with the built environment,

00:01:49.121 --> 00:01:51.824
and for those of you who know me, you would say

00:01:51.824 --> 00:01:53.810
that this obsession has led me to live

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:57.232
out of a suitcase 365 days a year.

00:01:57.232 --> 00:01:59.729
Being constantly on the move

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:01.544
means that sometimes I am able

00:02:01.544 --> 00:02:04.720
to catch life's most unpredictable moments,

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:06.701
like here in New York

00:02:06.701 --> 00:02:11.094
the day after the Sandy storm hit the city.

00:02:11.094 --> 00:02:13.158
Just over three years ago,

00:02:13.158 --> 00:02:15.844
I was for the first time in Caracas, Venezuela,

00:02:15.844 --> 00:02:18.640
and while flying over the city, I was just amazed

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:20.680
by the extent to which the slums

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:23.129
reach into every corner of the city,

00:02:23.129 --> 00:02:25.866
a place where nearly 70 percent of the population

00:02:25.866 --> 00:02:27.207
lives in slums,

00:02:27.207 --> 00:02:30.500
draped literally all over the mountains.

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:33.927
During a conversation with local architects Urban-Think Tank,

00:02:33.927 --> 00:02:36.280
I learned about the Torre David,

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:38.823
a 45-story office building which sits

00:02:38.823 --> 00:02:40.876
right in the center of Caracas.

00:02:40.876 --> 00:02:42.479
The building was under construction

00:02:42.479 --> 00:02:45.005
until the collapse of the Venezuelan economy

00:02:45.005 --> 00:02:48.371
and the death of the developer in the early '90s.

00:02:48.371 --> 00:02:51.333
About eight years ago, people started moving

00:02:51.333 --> 00:02:53.346
into the abandoned tower

00:02:53.346 --> 00:02:55.365
and began to build their homes right in between

00:02:55.365 --> 00:02:58.564
every column of this unfinished tower.

00:02:58.564 --> 00:03:01.361
There's only one little entrance to the entire building,

00:03:01.361 --> 00:03:04.299
and the 3,000 residents come in and out

00:03:04.299 --> 00:03:06.367
through that single door.

00:03:06.367 --> 00:03:09.256
Together, the inhabitants created public spaces

00:03:09.256 --> 00:03:11.529
and designed them to feel more like a home

00:03:11.529 --> 00:03:14.124
and less like an unfinished tower.

00:03:14.124 --> 00:03:17.639
In the lobby, they painted the walls and planted trees.

00:03:17.639 --> 00:03:20.649
They also made a basketball court.

00:03:20.649 --> 00:03:22.349
But when you look up closely,

00:03:22.349 --> 00:03:24.830
you see massive holes where elevators

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:27.410
and services would have run through.

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:29.399
Within the tower, people have come up

00:03:29.399 --> 00:03:31.665
with all sorts of solutions

00:03:31.665 --> 00:03:33.646
in response to the various needs

00:03:33.646 --> 00:03:37.133
which arise from living in an unfinished tower.

00:03:37.133 --> 00:03:38.332
With no elevators,

00:03:38.332 --> 00:03:41.660
the tower is like a 45-story walkup.

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:43.910
Designed in very specific ways

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:45.386
by this group of people

00:03:45.386 --> 00:03:49.282
who haven't had any education in architecture or design.

00:03:49.282 --> 00:03:51.563
And with each inhabitant finding their own

00:03:51.563 --> 00:03:53.530
unique way of coming by,

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:56.332
this tower becomes like a living city,

00:03:56.332 --> 00:03:59.544
a place which is alive with micro-economies

00:03:59.544 --> 00:04:01.461
and small businesses.

00:04:01.461 --> 00:04:04.075
The inventive inhabitants, for instance,

00:04:04.075 --> 00:04:06.806
find opportunities in the most unexpected cases,

00:04:06.806 --> 00:04:08.931
like the adjacent parking garage,

00:04:08.931 --> 00:04:11.008
which has been reclaimed as a taxi route

00:04:11.008 --> 00:04:13.306
to shuttle the inhabitants up through the ramps

00:04:13.306 --> 00:04:14.753
in order to shorten the hike

00:04:14.753 --> 00:04:18.771
up to the apartments.

00:04:18.771 --> 00:04:20.681
A walk through the tower

00:04:20.681 --> 00:04:22.791
reveals how residents have figured out

00:04:22.791 --> 00:04:26.317
how to create walls, how to make an air flow,

00:04:26.317 --> 00:04:28.280
how to create transparency,

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:30.704
circulation throughout the tower,

00:04:30.704 --> 00:04:32.523
essentially creating a home

00:04:32.523 --> 00:04:34.171
that's completely adapted

00:04:34.171 --> 00:04:37.449
to the conditions of the site.

00:04:37.449 --> 00:04:39.574
When a new inhabitant moves into the tower,

00:04:39.574 --> 00:04:41.482
they already have a roof over their head,

00:04:41.482 --> 00:04:43.521
so they just typically mark their space

00:04:43.521 --> 00:04:46.437
with a few curtains or sheets.

00:04:46.437 --> 00:04:49.609
Slowly, from found materials, walls rise,

00:04:49.609 --> 00:04:52.532
and people create a space out of any found objects

00:04:52.532 --> 00:04:54.421
or materials.

00:04:54.421 --> 00:04:56.921
It's remarkable to see the design decisions

00:04:56.921 --> 00:04:58.597
that they're making,

00:04:58.597 --> 00:05:01.232
like when everything is made out of red bricks,

00:05:01.232 --> 00:05:03.497
some residents will cover that red brick

00:05:03.497 --> 00:05:07.358
with another layer of red brick-patterned wallpaper

00:05:07.358 --> 00:05:12.410
just to make it a kind of clean finish.

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:14.869
The inhabitants literally built up these homes

00:05:14.869 --> 00:05:17.026
with their own hands, and this labor of love

00:05:17.026 --> 00:05:18.779
instills a great sense of pride

00:05:18.779 --> 00:05:22.031
in many families living in this tower.

00:05:22.031 --> 00:05:24.965
They typically make the best out of their conditions,

00:05:24.965 --> 00:05:27.773
and try to make their spaces look nice and homey,

00:05:27.773 --> 00:05:31.320
or at least up until as far as they can reach.

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:34.332
Throughout the tower, you come across

00:05:34.332 --> 00:05:36.498
all kinds of services, like the barber,

00:05:36.498 --> 00:05:40.311
small factories, and every floor has

00:05:40.311 --> 00:05:43.735
a little grocery store or shop.

00:05:43.735 --> 00:05:46.245
And you even find a church.

00:05:46.245 --> 00:05:48.609
And on the 30th floor, there is a gym

00:05:48.609 --> 00:05:50.363
where all the weights and barbells

00:05:50.363 --> 00:05:52.159
are made out of the leftover pulleys

00:05:52.159 --> 00:05:55.569
from the elevators which were never installed.

00:05:55.569 --> 00:05:58.204
From the outside, behind this always-changing facade,

00:05:58.204 --> 00:05:59.823
you see how the fixed concrete beams

00:05:59.823 --> 00:06:01.688
provide a framework for the inhabitants

00:06:01.688 --> 00:06:03.155
to create their homes

00:06:03.155 --> 00:06:05.031
in an organic, intuitive way

00:06:05.031 --> 00:06:07.748
that responds directly to their needs.

00:06:07.748 --> 00:06:10.403
Let's go now to Africa, to Nigeria,

00:06:10.403 --> 00:06:12.974
to a community called Makoko,

00:06:12.974 --> 00:06:15.533
a slum where 150,000 people

00:06:15.533 --> 00:06:18.715
live just meters above the Lagos Lagoon.

00:06:18.715 --> 00:06:22.429
While it may appear to be a completely chaotic place,

00:06:22.429 --> 00:06:24.835
when you see it from above, there seems to be

00:06:24.835 --> 00:06:28.000
a whole grid of waterways and canals

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.514
connecting each and every home.

00:06:30.514 --> 00:06:34.728
From the main dock, people board long wooden canoes

00:06:34.728 --> 00:06:37.398
which carry them out to their various homes and shops

00:06:37.398 --> 00:06:40.073
located in the expansive area.

00:06:40.073 --> 00:06:42.020
When out on the water, it's clear

00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:43.909
that life has been completely adapted

00:06:43.909 --> 00:06:46.548
to this very specific way of living.

00:06:46.548 --> 00:06:49.195
Even the canoes become variety stores

00:06:49.195 --> 00:06:51.135
where ladies paddle from house to house,

00:06:51.135 --> 00:06:55.251
selling anything from toothpaste to fresh fruits.

00:06:55.251 --> 00:06:57.270
Behind every window and door frame,

00:06:57.270 --> 00:06:59.973
you'll see a small child peering back at you,

00:06:59.973 --> 00:07:02.957
and while Makoko seems to be packed with people,

00:07:02.957 --> 00:07:04.792
what's more shocking is actually

00:07:04.792 --> 00:07:08.277
the amount of children pouring out of every building.

00:07:08.277 --> 00:07:10.257
The population growth in Nigeria,

00:07:10.257 --> 00:07:12.726
and especially in these areas like Makoko,

00:07:12.726 --> 00:07:14.878
are painful reminders

00:07:14.878 --> 00:07:19.117
of how out of control things really are.

00:07:19.117 --> 00:07:21.396
In Makoko, very few systems

00:07:21.396 --> 00:07:23.262
and infrastructures exist.

00:07:23.262 --> 00:07:26.194
Electricity is rigged and freshest water

00:07:26.194 --> 00:07:29.559
comes from self-built wells throughout the area.

00:07:29.559 --> 00:07:31.963
This entire economic model

00:07:31.963 --> 00:07:34.755
is designed to meet a specific way of living

00:07:34.755 --> 00:07:37.870
on the water, so fishing and boat-making

00:07:37.870 --> 00:07:39.645
are common professions.

00:07:39.645 --> 00:07:41.612
You'll have a set of entrepreneurs

00:07:41.612 --> 00:07:44.636
who have set up businesses throughout the area,

00:07:44.636 --> 00:07:49.436
like barbershops, CD and DVD stores,

00:07:49.436 --> 00:07:54.799
movie theaters, tailors, everything is there.

00:07:54.799 --> 00:07:56.594
There is even a photo studio

00:07:56.594 --> 00:07:58.351
where you see the sort of aspiration

00:07:58.351 --> 00:08:01.651
to live in a real house or to be associated

00:08:01.651 --> 00:08:05.950
with a faraway place, like that hotel in Sweden.

00:08:05.950 --> 00:08:07.574
On this particular evening,

00:08:07.574 --> 00:08:09.678
I came across this live band

00:08:09.678 --> 00:08:12.829
dressed to the T in their coordinating outfits.

00:08:12.829 --> 00:08:14.859
They were floating through the canals

00:08:14.859 --> 00:08:17.783
in a large canoe with a fitted-out generator

00:08:17.783 --> 00:08:22.119
for all of the community to enjoy.

00:08:22.119 --> 00:08:25.110
By nightfall, the area becomes almost pitch black,

00:08:25.110 --> 00:08:26.938
save for a small lightbulb

00:08:26.938 --> 00:08:29.672
or a fire.

00:08:29.672 --> 00:08:32.287
What originally brought me to Makoko

00:08:32.287 --> 00:08:34.094
was this project from a friend of mine,

00:08:34.094 --> 00:08:36.895
Kunlé Adeyemi, who recently finished building

00:08:36.895 --> 00:08:38.941
this three-story floating school

00:08:38.941 --> 00:08:40.962
for the kids in Makoko.

00:08:40.962 --> 00:08:43.991
With this entire village existing on the water,

00:08:43.991 --> 00:08:46.414
public space is very limited,

00:08:46.414 --> 00:08:48.078
so now that the school is finished,

00:08:48.078 --> 00:08:51.452
the ground floor is a playground for the kids,

00:08:51.452 --> 00:08:53.319
but when classes are out, the platform

00:08:53.319 --> 00:08:54.890
is just like a town square,

00:08:54.890 --> 00:08:57.285
where the fishermen mend their nets

00:08:57.285 --> 00:09:01.450
and floating shopkeepers dock their boats.

00:09:01.450 --> 00:09:03.980
Another place I'd like to share with you

00:09:03.980 --> 00:09:06.028
is the Zabbaleen in Cairo.

00:09:06.028 --> 00:09:08.787
They're descendants of farmers who began migrating

00:09:08.787 --> 00:09:11.257
from the upper Egypt in the '40s,

00:09:11.257 --> 00:09:12.683
and today they make their living

00:09:12.683 --> 00:09:15.873
by collecting and recycling waste from homes

00:09:15.873 --> 00:09:18.124
from all over Cairo.

00:09:18.124 --> 00:09:21.246
For years, the Zabbaleen would live in makeshift villages

00:09:21.246 --> 00:09:22.915
where they would move around

00:09:22.915 --> 00:09:25.434
trying to avoid the local authorities,

00:09:25.434 --> 00:09:27.753
but in the early 1980s, they settled

00:09:27.753 --> 00:09:29.470
on the Mokattam rocks

00:09:29.470 --> 00:09:32.119
just at the eastern edge of the city.

00:09:32.119 --> 00:09:34.150
Today, they live in this area,

00:09:34.150 --> 00:09:36.954
approximately 50,000 to 70,000 people,

00:09:36.954 --> 00:09:39.087
who live in this community of self-built

00:09:39.087 --> 00:09:41.267
multi-story houses

00:09:41.267 --> 00:09:45.560
where up to three generations live in one structure.

00:09:45.560 --> 00:09:48.038
While these apartments that they built for themselves

00:09:48.038 --> 00:09:51.023
appear to lack any planning or formal grid,

00:09:51.023 --> 00:09:54.429
each family specializing in a certain form of recycling

00:09:54.429 --> 00:09:56.662
means that the ground floor of each apartment

00:09:56.662 --> 00:10:00.319
is reserved for garbage-related activities

00:10:00.319 --> 00:10:04.342
and the upper floor is dedicated to living space.

00:10:04.342 --> 00:10:06.213
I find it incredible to see

00:10:06.213 --> 00:10:08.149
how these piles and piles of garbage

00:10:08.149 --> 00:10:10.660
are invisible to the people who live there,

00:10:10.660 --> 00:10:14.060
like this very distinguished man who is posing

00:10:14.060 --> 00:10:18.269
while all this garbage is sort of streaming out behind him,

00:10:18.269 --> 00:10:20.909
or like these two young men who are sitting

00:10:20.909 --> 00:10:25.761
and chatting amongst these tons of garbage.

00:10:25.761 --> 00:10:27.494
While to most of us, living amongst

00:10:27.494 --> 00:10:29.582
these piles and piles of garbage

00:10:29.582 --> 00:10:31.933
may seem totally uninhabitable,

00:10:31.933 --> 00:10:34.023
to those in the Zabbaleen, this is just

00:10:34.023 --> 00:10:36.502
a different type of normal.

00:10:36.502 --> 00:10:39.139
In all these places I've talked about today,

00:10:39.139 --> 00:10:41.260
what I do find fascinating is that there's really

00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:42.858
no such thing as normal,

00:10:42.858 --> 00:10:45.063
and it proves that people are able to adapt

00:10:45.063 --> 00:10:47.438
to any kind of situation.

00:10:47.438 --> 00:10:48.954
Throughout the day, it's quite common

00:10:48.954 --> 00:10:52.302
to come across a small party taking place

00:10:52.302 --> 00:10:56.146
in the streets, just like this engagement party.

00:10:56.146 --> 00:10:58.133
In this tradition, the bride-to-be

00:10:58.133 --> 00:11:00.278
displays all of their belongings,

00:11:00.278 --> 00:11:02.472
which they soon bring to their new husband.

00:11:02.472 --> 00:11:04.503
A gathering like this one

00:11:04.503 --> 00:11:06.400
offers such a juxtaposition

00:11:06.400 --> 00:11:09.178
where all the new stuff is displayed

00:11:09.178 --> 00:11:11.544
and all the garbage is used

00:11:11.544 --> 00:11:18.181
as props to display all their new home accessories.

00:11:18.181 --> 00:11:20.347
Like Makoko and the Torre David,

00:11:20.347 --> 00:11:21.892
throughout the Zabbaleen you'll find all

00:11:21.892 --> 00:11:25.036
the same facilities as in any typical neighborhood.

00:11:25.036 --> 00:11:27.116
There are the retail shops, the cafes

00:11:27.116 --> 00:11:29.436
and the restaurants, and the community

00:11:29.436 --> 00:11:32.377
is this community of Coptic Christians,

00:11:32.377 --> 00:11:34.616
so you'll also find a church,

00:11:34.616 --> 00:11:38.061
along with the scores of religious iconographies

00:11:38.061 --> 00:11:39.819
throughout the area,

00:11:39.819 --> 00:11:43.008
and also all the everyday services

00:11:43.008 --> 00:11:44.807
like the electronic repair shops,

00:11:44.807 --> 00:11:47.895
the barbers, everything.

00:11:47.895 --> 00:11:50.068
Visiting the homes of the Zabbaleen

00:11:50.068 --> 00:11:51.757
is also full of surprises.

00:11:51.757 --> 00:11:53.269
While from the outside,

00:11:53.269 --> 00:11:55.812
these homes look like any other informal structure

00:11:55.812 --> 00:11:58.130
in the city, when you step inside,

00:11:58.130 --> 00:12:01.993
you are met with all manner of design decisions

00:12:01.993 --> 00:12:04.260
and interior decoration.

00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:07.424
Despite having limited access to space and money,

00:12:07.424 --> 00:12:09.303
the homes in the area are designed

00:12:09.303 --> 00:12:11.289
with care and detail.

00:12:11.289 --> 00:12:13.332
Every apartment is unique,

00:12:13.332 --> 00:12:15.125
and this individuality tells a story

00:12:15.125 --> 00:12:18.251
about each family's circumstances and values.

00:12:18.251 --> 00:12:20.397
Many of these people take their homes

00:12:20.397 --> 00:12:23.565
and interior spaces very seriously,

00:12:23.565 --> 00:12:25.072
putting a lot of work and care

00:12:25.072 --> 00:12:26.398
into the details.

00:12:26.398 --> 00:12:29.571
The shared spaces are also treated in the same manner,

00:12:29.571 --> 00:12:33.428
where walls are decorated in faux marble patterns.

00:12:33.428 --> 00:12:36.411
But despite this elaborate decor,

00:12:36.411 --> 00:12:38.965
sometimes these apartments are used

00:12:38.965 --> 00:12:40.775
in very unexpected ways,

00:12:40.775 --> 00:12:43.155
like this home which caught my attention

00:12:43.155 --> 00:12:46.637
while all the mud and the grass was literally

00:12:46.637 --> 00:12:49.124
seeping out under the front door.

00:12:49.124 --> 00:12:52.923
When I was let in, it appeared that this fifth-floor apartment

00:12:52.923 --> 00:12:56.231
was being transformed into a complete animal farm,

00:12:56.231 --> 00:12:59.122
where six or seven cows stood grazing

00:12:59.122 --> 00:13:03.794
in what otherwise would be the living room.

00:13:03.794 --> 00:13:07.162
But then in the apartment across the hall

00:13:07.162 --> 00:13:09.685
from this cow shed lives a newly married couple

00:13:09.685 --> 00:13:11.511
in what locals describe

00:13:11.511 --> 00:13:19.632
as one of the nicest apartments in the area.

00:13:19.632 --> 00:13:22.858
The attention to this detail astonished me,

00:13:22.858 --> 00:13:25.529
and as the owner of the home so proudly

00:13:25.529 --> 00:13:27.515
led me around this apartment,

00:13:27.515 --> 00:13:31.231
from floor to ceiling, every part was decorated.

00:13:31.231 --> 00:13:35.033
But if it weren't for the strangely familiar

00:13:35.033 --> 00:13:37.896
stomach-churning odor that constantly

00:13:37.896 --> 00:13:41.341
passes through the apartment,

00:13:41.341 --> 00:13:43.934
it would be easy to forget

00:13:43.934 --> 00:13:46.626
that you are standing next to a cow shed

00:13:46.626 --> 00:13:52.123
and on top of a landfill.

00:13:52.123 --> 00:13:54.802
What moved me the most was that despite

00:13:54.802 --> 00:13:56.836
these seemingly inhospitable conditions,

00:13:56.836 --> 00:13:58.629
I was welcomed with open arms

00:13:58.629 --> 00:14:02.555
into a home that was made with love, care,

00:14:02.555 --> 00:14:04.805
and unreserved passion.

00:14:04.805 --> 00:14:08.189
Let's move across the map to China,

00:14:08.189 --> 00:14:12.076
to an area called Shanxi, Henan and Gansu.

00:14:12.076 --> 00:14:15.766
In a region famous for the soft, porous Loess Plateau soil,

00:14:15.766 --> 00:14:18.449
there lived until recently an estimated

00:14:18.449 --> 00:14:22.318
40 million people in these houses underground.

00:14:22.318 --> 00:14:24.769
These dwellings are called the yaodongs.

00:14:24.769 --> 00:14:26.959
Through this architecture by subtraction,

00:14:26.959 --> 00:14:30.546
these yaodongs are built literally inside of the soil.

00:14:30.546 --> 00:14:34.420
In these villages, you see an entirely altered landscape,

00:14:34.420 --> 00:14:37.166
and hidden behind these mounds of dirt

00:14:37.166 --> 00:14:39.666
are these square, rectangular houses

00:14:39.666 --> 00:14:42.257
which sit seven meters below the ground.

00:14:42.257 --> 00:14:44.245
When I asked people why they were digging

00:14:44.245 --> 00:14:46.134
their houses from the ground,

00:14:46.134 --> 00:14:48.157
they simply replied that they are poor wheat

00:14:48.157 --> 00:14:50.337
and apple farmers who didn't have the money

00:14:50.337 --> 00:14:53.738
to buy materials, and this digging out

00:14:53.738 --> 00:14:58.206
was their most logical form of living.

00:14:58.206 --> 00:15:01.104
From Makoko to Zabbaleen, these communities

00:15:01.104 --> 00:15:03.103
have approached the tasks of planning,

00:15:03.103 --> 00:15:05.502
design and management of their communities

00:15:05.502 --> 00:15:07.881
and neighborhoods in ways that respond

00:15:07.881 --> 00:15:11.791
specifically to their environment and circumstances.

00:15:11.791 --> 00:15:14.022
Created by these very people who live,

00:15:14.022 --> 00:15:17.733
work and play in these particular spaces,

00:15:17.733 --> 00:15:20.730
these neighborhoods are intuitively designed

00:15:20.730 --> 00:15:23.768
to make the most of their circumstances.

00:15:23.768 --> 00:15:25.673
In most of these places, the government

00:15:25.673 --> 00:15:28.202
is completely absent, leaving inhabitants

00:15:28.202 --> 00:15:32.121
with no choice but to reappropriate found materials,

00:15:32.121 --> 00:15:35.093
and while these communities are highly disadvantaged,

00:15:35.093 --> 00:15:37.135
they do present examples

00:15:37.135 --> 00:15:39.583
of brilliant forms of ingenuity,

00:15:39.583 --> 00:15:41.911
and prove that indeed we have the ability

00:15:41.911 --> 00:15:45.454
to adapt to all manner of circumstances.

00:15:45.454 --> 00:15:47.647
What makes places like the Torre David

00:15:47.647 --> 00:15:49.444
particularly remarkable

00:15:49.444 --> 00:15:51.345
is this sort of skeleton framework

00:15:51.345 --> 00:15:52.967
where people can have a foundation

00:15:52.967 --> 00:15:55.039
where they can tap into.

00:15:55.039 --> 00:15:58.137
Now imagine what these already ingenious communities

00:15:58.137 --> 00:16:00.229
could create themselves,

00:16:00.229 --> 00:16:02.915
and how highly particular their solutions would be,

00:16:02.915 --> 00:16:05.457
if they were given the basic infrastructures

00:16:05.457 --> 00:16:07.436
that they could tap into.

00:16:07.436 --> 00:16:10.943
Today, you see these large residential development projects

00:16:10.943 --> 00:16:13.398
which offer cookie-cutter housing solutions

00:16:13.398 --> 00:16:15.440
to massive amounts of people.

00:16:15.440 --> 00:16:18.000
From China to Brazil, these projects attempt

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:21.007
to provide as many houses as possible,

00:16:21.007 --> 00:16:23.210
but they're completely generic

00:16:23.210 --> 00:16:25.115
and simply do not work as an answer

00:16:25.115 --> 00:16:28.444
to the individual needs of the people.

00:16:28.444 --> 00:16:30.898
I would like to end with a quote

00:16:30.898 --> 00:16:33.979
from a friend of mine and a source of inspiration,

00:16:33.979 --> 00:16:36.745
Zita Cobb, the founder of the wonderful

00:16:36.745 --> 00:16:38.421
Shorefast Foundation,

00:16:38.421 --> 00:16:41.510
based out of Fogo Island, Newfoundland.

00:16:41.510 --> 00:16:44.351
She says that "there's this plague of sameness

00:16:44.351 --> 00:16:46.274
which is killing the human joy,"

00:16:46.274 --> 00:16:48.569
and I couldn't agree with her more.

00:16:48.569 --> 00:16:50.012
Thank you.

00:16:50.012 --> 00:16:53.974
(Applause)
