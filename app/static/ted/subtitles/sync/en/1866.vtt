00:00:13.085 --> 00:00:15.199
Today I am going to teach you

00:00:15.199 --> 00:00:18.959
how to play my favorite game:

00:00:18.959 --> 00:00:22.442
massively multiplayer thumb-wrestling.

00:00:22.442 --> 00:00:25.762
It's the only game in the world that I know of

00:00:25.762 --> 00:00:27.829
that allows you, the player,

00:00:27.829 --> 00:00:30.248
the opportunity to experience

00:00:30.248 --> 00:00:34.636
10 positive emotions in 60 seconds or less.

00:00:34.636 --> 00:00:37.148
This is true, so if you play this game with me today

00:00:37.148 --> 00:00:39.151
for just one single minute,

00:00:39.151 --> 00:00:42.851
you will get to feel joy, relief, love, surprise,

00:00:42.851 --> 00:00:45.917
pride, curiosity, excitement, awe and wonder,

00:00:45.917 --> 00:00:47.515
contentment, and creativity,

00:00:47.515 --> 00:00:49.054
all in the span of one minute.

00:00:49.054 --> 00:00:51.386
So this sounds pretty good, right?
Now you're willing to play.

00:00:51.386 --> 00:00:52.949
In order to teach you this game,

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:54.322
I'm going to need some volunteers

00:00:54.322 --> 00:00:56.225
to come up onstage really quickly,

00:00:56.225 --> 00:00:57.703
and we're going to do a little hands-on demo.

00:00:57.703 --> 00:00:59.744
While they're coming up, I should let you know,

00:00:59.744 --> 00:01:02.206
this game was invented 10 years ago

00:01:02.206 --> 00:01:05.503
by an artists' collective in Austria named Monochrom.

00:01:05.503 --> 00:01:07.248
So thank you, Monochrom.

00:01:07.248 --> 00:01:09.291
Okay, so most people are familiar

00:01:09.291 --> 00:01:11.283
with traditional, two-person thumb-wrestling.

00:01:11.283 --> 00:01:12.871
Sunni, let's just remind them.

00:01:12.871 --> 00:01:15.657
One, two, three, four, 
I declare a thumb war, and we wrestle,

00:01:15.657 --> 00:01:17.757
and of course Sunni beats me
because she's the best.

00:01:17.757 --> 00:01:21.561
Now the first thing about
massively multiplayer thumb-wrestling,

00:01:21.561 --> 00:01:22.972
we're the gamer generation.

00:01:22.972 --> 00:01:25.323
There are a billion gamers on the planet now,

00:01:25.323 --> 00:01:26.877
so we need more of a challenge.

00:01:26.877 --> 00:01:30.256
So the first thing we need is more thumbs.

00:01:30.256 --> 00:01:31.950
So Eric, come on over.

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.761
So we could get three thumbs together,

00:01:34.761 --> 00:01:37.219
and Peter could join us.

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:38.939
We could even have four thumbs together,

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:40.466
and the way you win

00:01:40.466 --> 00:01:43.663
is you're the first person
to pin someone else's thumb.

00:01:43.663 --> 00:01:45.521
This is really important. You can't, like,

00:01:45.521 --> 00:01:48.058
wait while they fight it out and
then swoop in at the last minute.

00:01:48.058 --> 00:01:49.553
That is not how you win.

00:01:49.553 --> 00:01:50.888
Ah, who did that? Eric you did that.

00:01:50.888 --> 00:01:53.690
So Eric would have won. He was
the first person to pin my thumb.

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:55.100
Okay, so that's the first rule,

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:56.959
and we can see that three or four

00:01:56.959 --> 00:02:00.138
is kind of the typical number of thumbs in a node,

00:02:00.138 --> 00:02:02.780
but if you feel ambitious,
you don't have to hold back.

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:04.145
We can really go for it.

00:02:04.145 --> 00:02:06.311
So you can see up here.

00:02:06.311 --> 00:02:09.283
Now the only other rule you need to remember is,

00:02:09.283 --> 00:02:11.550
gamer generation, we like a challenge.

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:13.197
I happen to notice you all have

00:02:13.197 --> 00:02:15.033
some thumbs you're not using.

00:02:15.033 --> 00:02:18.040
So I think we should kind of get some more involved.

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:19.810
And if we had just four people,

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:21.648
we would do it just like this,

00:02:21.648 --> 00:02:23.334
and we would try and wrestle

00:02:23.334 --> 00:02:25.115
both thumbs at the same time.

00:02:25.115 --> 00:02:26.422
Perfect.

00:02:26.422 --> 00:02:28.536
Now, if we had more people in the room,

00:02:28.536 --> 00:02:30.415
instead of just wrestling in a closed node,

00:02:30.415 --> 00:02:33.198
we might reach out and try
and grab some other people.

00:02:33.198 --> 00:02:34.919
And in fact, that's what we're going to do right now.

00:02:34.919 --> 00:02:37.471
We're going to try and get all, something like,

00:02:37.471 --> 00:02:40.447
I don't know, 1,500 thumbs in this room

00:02:40.447 --> 00:02:41.760
connected in a single node.

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:44.800
And we have to connect both levels,

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:47.246
so if you're up there, you're going to be

00:02:47.246 --> 00:02:49.459
reaching down and reaching up.

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:51.133
Now — (Laughter) —

00:02:51.133 --> 00:02:53.025
before we get started --

00:02:53.025 --> 00:02:56.058
This is great. You're excited to play. —

00:02:56.058 --> 00:02:59.138
before we get started, can I have
the slides back up here really quick,

00:02:59.138 --> 00:03:01.095
because if you get good at this game,

00:03:01.095 --> 00:03:03.731
I want you to know there are some advanced levels.

00:03:03.731 --> 00:03:06.643
So this is the kind of simple level, right?

00:03:06.643 --> 00:03:08.555
But there are advanced configurations.

00:03:08.555 --> 00:03:10.565
This is called the Death Star Configuration.

00:03:10.565 --> 00:03:12.272
Any Star Wars fans?

00:03:12.272 --> 00:03:14.620
And this one's called the Möbius Strip.

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:16.440
Any science geeks, you get that one.

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:19.344
This is the hardest level. This is the extreme.

00:03:19.344 --> 00:03:21.358
So we'll stick with the normal one for now,

00:03:21.358 --> 00:03:23.300
and I'm going to give you 30 seconds,

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:25.325
every thumb into the node,

00:03:25.325 --> 00:03:26.798
connect the upper and the lower levels,

00:03:26.798 --> 00:03:28.300
you guys go on down there.

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:32.476
Thirty seconds. Into the network. Make the node.

00:03:33.328 --> 00:03:36.082
Stand up! It's easier if you stand up.

00:03:36.082 --> 00:03:40.021
Everybody, up up up up up!

00:03:40.021 --> 00:03:42.785
Stand up, my friends.

00:03:43.311 --> 00:03:44.343
All right.

00:03:44.343 --> 00:03:47.151
Don't start wrestling yet.

00:03:47.151 --> 00:03:49.931
If you have a free thumb, wave it around,

00:03:49.931 --> 00:03:53.152
make sure it gets connected.

00:03:53.152 --> 00:03:55.844
Okay. We need to do a last-minute thumb check.

00:03:55.844 --> 00:03:59.177
If you have a free thumb,
wave it around to make sure.

00:03:59.177 --> 00:04:00.670
Grab that thumb!

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:02.013
Reach behind you. There you go.

00:04:02.013 --> 00:04:03.571
Any other thumbs?

00:04:03.571 --> 00:04:06.086
Okay, on the count of three, you're going to go.

00:04:06.086 --> 00:04:08.799
Try to keep track. Grab, grab, grab it.

00:04:08.799 --> 00:04:11.329
Okay? One, two, three, go!

00:04:11.329 --> 00:04:15.418
(Laughter)

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:21.682
Did you win? You got it? You got it? Excellent!

00:04:21.682 --> 00:04:24.199
(Applause)

00:04:24.199 --> 00:04:27.741
Well done. Thank you. Thank you very much.

00:04:27.741 --> 00:04:29.146
All right.

00:04:29.146 --> 00:04:32.558
While you are basking in the glow

00:04:32.558 --> 00:04:34.360
of having won your first

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:35.975
massively multiplayer thumb-wrestling game,

00:04:35.975 --> 00:04:38.565
let's do a quick recap on the positive emotions.

00:04:38.565 --> 00:04:40.504
So curiosity.

00:04:40.504 --> 00:04:42.476
I said "massively multiplayer thumb-wrestling."

00:04:42.476 --> 00:04:44.276
You were like, "What the hell is she talking about?"

00:04:44.276 --> 00:04:46.153
So I provoked a little curiosity.

00:04:46.153 --> 00:04:48.822
Creativity: it took creativity to solve the problem

00:04:48.822 --> 00:04:50.181
of getting all the thumbs into the node.

00:04:50.181 --> 00:04:51.594
I'm reaching around and I'm reaching up.

00:04:51.594 --> 00:04:53.148
So you used creativity. That was great.

00:04:53.148 --> 00:04:55.400
How about surprise? The actual feeling

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:58.062
of trying to wrestle two thumbs at once
is pretty surprising.

00:04:58.062 --> 00:04:59.922
You heard that sound go up in the room.

00:04:59.922 --> 00:05:01.761
We had excitement. As you started to wrestle,

00:05:01.761 --> 00:05:03.966
maybe you're starting to win
or this person's, like, really into it,

00:05:03.966 --> 00:05:06.452
so you kind of get the excitement going.

00:05:06.452 --> 00:05:08.395
We have relief. You got to stand up.

00:05:08.395 --> 00:05:10.153
You've been sitting for awhile, so the physical relief,

00:05:10.153 --> 00:05:11.470
getting to shake it out.

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:16.030
We had joy. You were laughing, smiling.
Look at your faces. This room is full of joy.

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:17.990
We had some contentment.

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:21.679
I didn't see anybody sending text messages
or checking their email while we were playing,

00:05:21.679 --> 00:05:23.672
so you were totally content to be playing.

00:05:23.672 --> 00:05:25.360
The most important three emotions,

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:28.972
awe and wonder, we had everybody
connected physically for a minute.

00:05:28.972 --> 00:05:30.571
When was the last time you were at TED

00:05:30.571 --> 00:05:33.400
and you got to connect physically
with every single person in the room?

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:35.046
And it's truly awesome and wondrous.

00:05:35.046 --> 00:05:36.890
And speaking of physical connection,

00:05:36.890 --> 00:05:39.893
you guys know I love the hormone oxytocin,

00:05:39.893 --> 00:05:43.070
you release oxytocin, you feel bonded
to everyone in the room.

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:45.586
You guys know that the best way
to release oxytocin quickly

00:05:45.586 --> 00:05:48.085
is to hold someone else's hand
for at least six seconds.

00:05:48.085 --> 00:05:50.637
You guys were all holding hands
for way more than six seconds,

00:05:50.637 --> 00:05:52.417
so we are all now biochemically primed

00:05:52.417 --> 00:05:54.270
to love each other. That is great.

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:57.194
And the last emotion of pride.

00:05:57.194 --> 00:05:59.998
How many people are like me. Just admit it.

00:05:59.998 --> 00:06:01.144
You lost both your thumbs.

00:06:01.144 --> 00:06:03.093
It just didn't work out for you.

00:06:03.093 --> 00:06:05.656
That's okay, because you learned a new skill today.

00:06:05.656 --> 00:06:08.420
You learned, from scratch,
a game you never knew before.

00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:10.126
Now you know how to play it.
You can teach other people.

00:06:10.126 --> 00:06:11.694
So congratulations.

00:06:11.694 --> 00:06:14.015
How many of you won just won thumb?

00:06:14.015 --> 00:06:15.386
All right. I have very good news for you.

00:06:15.386 --> 00:06:16.518
According to the official rules

00:06:16.518 --> 00:06:18.514
of massively multiplayer thumb-wrestling,

00:06:18.514 --> 00:06:22.295
this makes you a grandmaster of the game.

00:06:22.295 --> 00:06:24.527
Because there aren't that many
people who know how to play,

00:06:24.527 --> 00:06:26.726
we have to kind of accelerate the program

00:06:26.726 --> 00:06:28.319
more than a game like chess.

00:06:28.319 --> 00:06:30.112
So congratulations, grandmasters.

00:06:30.112 --> 00:06:32.603
Win one thumb once, you will
become a grandmaster.

00:06:32.603 --> 00:06:34.632
Did anybody win both their thumbs?

00:06:34.632 --> 00:06:36.131
Yes. Awesome. Okay.

00:06:36.131 --> 00:06:39.054
Get ready to update your Twitter or Facebook status.

00:06:39.054 --> 00:06:40.820
You guys, according to the rules,

00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:44.496
are legendary grandmasters, so congratulations.

00:06:44.496 --> 00:06:47.225
I will just leave you with this tip,
if you want to play again.

00:06:47.225 --> 00:06:49.013
The best way to become a legendary grandmaster,

00:06:49.013 --> 00:06:51.099
you've got your two nodes going on.

00:06:51.099 --> 00:06:52.821
Pick off the one that looks easiest.

00:06:52.821 --> 00:06:54.802
They're not paying attention. They look kind of weak.

00:06:54.802 --> 00:06:56.886
Focus on that one and do something crazy

00:06:56.886 --> 00:06:58.222
with this arm.

00:06:58.222 --> 00:07:00.551
As soon as you win, suddenly stop.

00:07:00.551 --> 00:07:02.351
Everybody is thrown off. You go in for the kill.

00:07:02.351 --> 00:07:04.917
That's how you become a legendary grandmaster
of massively multiplayer thumb-wrestling.

00:07:04.917 --> 00:07:07.444
Thank you for letting me
teach you my favorite game.

00:07:07.444 --> 00:07:09.280
Wooo! (Applause)

00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:13.360
Thank you. (Applause)
