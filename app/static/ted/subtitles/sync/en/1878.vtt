WEBVTT

00:00:12.381 --> 00:00:14.761
So yesterday, I was out in the street

00:00:14.761 --> 00:00:17.437
in front of this building,

00:00:17.437 --> 00:00:20.473
and I was walking down the sidewalk,

00:00:20.473 --> 00:00:22.333
and I had company, several of us,

00:00:22.333 --> 00:00:23.831
and we were all abiding by the rules

00:00:23.831 --> 00:00:26.218
of walking down sidewalks.

00:00:26.218 --> 00:00:28.660
We're not talking each other. We're facing forward.

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:30.083
We're moving.

00:00:30.083 --> 00:00:33.346
When the person in front of me slows down.

00:00:33.346 --> 00:00:35.336
And so I'm watching him, and he slows down,

00:00:35.336 --> 00:00:36.933
and finally he stops.

00:00:36.933 --> 00:00:39.018
Well, that wasn't fast enough for me,

00:00:39.018 --> 00:00:42.697
so I put on my turn signal, and I walked around him,

00:00:42.697 --> 00:00:45.430
and as I walked, I looked to see what he was doing,

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:47.993
and he was doing this.

00:00:47.998 --> 00:00:49.942
He was texting,

00:00:49.942 --> 00:00:51.964
and he couldn't text and walk at the same time.

00:00:51.964 --> 00:00:53.773
Now we could approach this

00:00:53.773 --> 00:00:55.665
from a working memory perspective

00:00:55.665 --> 00:00:57.650
or from a multitasking perspective.

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:00.179
We're going to do working memory today.

00:01:00.179 --> 00:01:02.319
Now, working memory

00:01:02.319 --> 00:01:05.467
is that part of our consciousness that we are

00:01:05.467 --> 00:01:07.921
aware of at any given time of day.

00:01:07.921 --> 00:01:09.563
You're going it right now.

00:01:09.563 --> 00:01:11.217
It's not something we can turn off.

00:01:11.217 --> 00:01:14.668
If you turn it off, that's called a coma, okay?

00:01:14.668 --> 00:01:17.771
So right now, you're doing just fine.

00:01:17.771 --> 00:01:20.127
Now working memory has four basic components.

00:01:20.127 --> 00:01:22.724
It allows us to store some immediate experiences

00:01:22.724 --> 00:01:24.340
and a little bit of knowledge.

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:27.709
It allows us to reach back
into our long-term memory

00:01:27.709 --> 00:01:29.559
and pull some of that in as we need it,

00:01:29.559 --> 00:01:31.759
mixes it, processes it

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:34.053
in light of whatever our current goal is.

00:01:34.053 --> 00:01:35.567
Now the current goal isn't something like,

00:01:35.567 --> 00:01:37.849
I want to be president or the best surfer in the world.

00:01:37.849 --> 00:01:40.652
It's more mundane. I'd like that cookie,

00:01:40.652 --> 00:01:43.254
or I need to figure out how to get into my hotel room.

00:01:43.254 --> 00:01:45.434
Now working memory capacity

00:01:45.434 --> 00:01:48.040
is our ability to leverage that,

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:50.835
our ability to take what we know

00:01:50.835 --> 00:01:52.111
and what we can hang onto

00:01:52.111 --> 00:01:55.710
and leverage it in ways that allow us to satisfy

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.460
our current goal.

00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:59.244
Now working memory capacity

00:01:59.244 --> 00:02:01.297
has a fairly long history,

00:02:01.297 --> 00:02:03.496
and it's associated with a lot of positive effects.

00:02:03.496 --> 00:02:05.884
People with high working memory capacity

00:02:05.884 --> 00:02:08.128
tend to be good storytellers.

00:02:08.128 --> 00:02:12.105
They tend to solve and do well
on standardized tests,

00:02:12.105 --> 00:02:14.450
however important that is.

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:18.233
They're able to have high levels of writing ability.

00:02:18.233 --> 00:02:21.107
They're also able to reason at high levels.

00:02:21.107 --> 00:02:24.025
So what we're going to do here
is play a little bit with some of that.

00:02:24.025 --> 00:02:26.575
So I'm going to ask you to perform a couple tasks,

00:02:26.575 --> 00:02:29.654
and we're going to take your 
working memory out for a ride.

00:02:29.654 --> 00:02:32.251
You up for that? Okay.

00:02:32.251 --> 00:02:34.449
I'm going to give you five words,

00:02:34.449 --> 00:02:36.242
and I just want you to hang on to them.

00:02:36.242 --> 00:02:38.110
Don't write them down. Just hang on to them.

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:39.522
Five words.

00:02:39.522 --> 00:02:42.725
While you're hanging on to them,
I'm going to ask you to answer three questions.

00:02:42.725 --> 00:02:44.630
I want to see what happens with those words.

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:46.477
So here's the words:

00:02:46.477 --> 00:02:49.765
tree,

00:02:49.765 --> 00:02:52.700
highway,

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:55.078
mirror,

00:02:55.078 --> 00:02:57.210
Saturn

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:59.629
and electrode.

00:02:59.629 --> 00:03:01.213
So far so good?

00:03:01.213 --> 00:03:03.067
Okay. What I want you to do

00:03:03.067 --> 00:03:06.414
is I want you to tell me what the answer is

00:03:06.414 --> 00:03:08.736
to 23 times eight.

00:03:08.736 --> 00:03:11.450
Just shout it out.

00:03:12.916 --> 00:03:16.618
(Mumbling) (Laughter)

00:03:16.618 --> 00:03:19.039
In fact it's -- (Mumbling) -- exactly. (Laughter)

00:03:19.039 --> 00:03:22.266
All right. I want you to take out your left hand

00:03:22.266 --> 00:03:24.946
and I want you to go, "One, two, three, four, five,

00:03:24.946 --> 00:03:27.149
six, seven, eight, nine, 10."

00:03:27.149 --> 00:03:29.845
It's a neurological test,
just in case you were wondering.

00:03:29.845 --> 00:03:31.710
All right, now what I want you to do

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:33.935
is to recite the last five letters

00:03:33.935 --> 00:03:36.804
of the English alphabet backwards.

00:03:38.787 --> 00:03:40.689
You should have started with Z.

00:03:40.689 --> 00:03:43.980
(Laughter)

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:46.067
All right. How many people here are still pretty sure

00:03:46.067 --> 00:03:48.518
you've got all five words?

00:03:48.518 --> 00:03:51.699
Okay. Typically we end up with about less than half,

00:03:51.699 --> 00:03:53.774
right, which is normal. There will be a range.

00:03:53.774 --> 00:03:55.330
Some people can hang on to five.

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:56.614
Some people can hang on to 10.

00:03:56.614 --> 00:03:58.919
Some will be down to two or three.

00:03:58.919 --> 00:04:02.323
What we know is this is really important
to the way we function, right?

00:04:02.323 --> 00:04:04.271
And it's going to be really important here at TED

00:04:04.271 --> 00:04:07.307
because you're going to be exposed
to so many different ideas.

00:04:07.307 --> 00:04:09.514
Now the problem that we have

00:04:09.514 --> 00:04:11.226
is that life comes at us,

00:04:11.226 --> 00:04:13.343
and it comes at us very quickly,

00:04:13.343 --> 00:04:17.256
and what we need to do is to take that amorphous

00:04:17.256 --> 00:04:19.034
flow of experience and somehow

00:04:19.034 --> 00:04:20.541
extract meaning from it

00:04:20.541 --> 00:04:21.840
with a working memory

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:24.109
that's about the size of a pea.

00:04:24.109 --> 00:04:26.656
Now don't get me wrong,
working memory is awesome.

00:04:26.656 --> 00:04:28.771
Working memory allows us

00:04:28.771 --> 00:04:31.143
to investigate our current experience

00:04:31.143 --> 00:04:32.638
as we move forward.

00:04:32.638 --> 00:04:35.806
It allows us to make sense of the world around us.

00:04:35.806 --> 00:04:37.725
But it does have certain limits.

00:04:37.725 --> 00:04:41.568
Now working memory is great
for allowing us to communicate.

00:04:41.568 --> 00:04:43.040
We can have a conversation,

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:45.727
and I can build a narrative around that

00:04:45.727 --> 00:04:47.457
so I know where we've been and where we're going

00:04:47.457 --> 00:04:49.545
and how to contribute to this conversation.

00:04:49.545 --> 00:04:51.782
It allows us to problem-solve, critical think.

00:04:51.782 --> 00:04:53.586
We can be in the middle of a meeting,

00:04:53.586 --> 00:04:56.089
listen to somebody's presentation, evaluate it,

00:04:56.089 --> 00:04:57.731
decide whether or not we like it,

00:04:57.731 --> 00:04:58.989
ask follow-up questions.

00:04:58.989 --> 00:05:02.359
All of that occurs within working memory.

00:05:02.359 --> 00:05:04.206
It also allows us to go to the store

00:05:04.206 --> 00:05:07.860
and allows us to get milk and eggs and cheese

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:09.631
when what we're really looking for

00:05:09.631 --> 00:05:12.468
is Red Bull and bacon. (Laughter)

00:05:12.468 --> 00:05:15.190
Gotta make sure we're getting what we're looking for.

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:18.527
Now, a central issue with working memory

00:05:18.527 --> 00:05:19.924
is that it's limited.

00:05:19.924 --> 00:05:22.120
It's limited in capacity, limited in duration,

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:23.730
limited in focus.

00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:26.465
We tend to remember about four things.

00:05:26.465 --> 00:05:28.362
Okay? It used to be seven,

00:05:28.362 --> 00:05:30.386
but with functional MRIs, apparently it's four,

00:05:30.386 --> 00:05:32.929
and we were overachieving.

00:05:32.929 --> 00:05:34.902
Now we can remember those four things

00:05:34.902 --> 00:05:36.765
for about 10 to 20 seconds

00:05:36.765 --> 00:05:38.492
unless we do something with it,

00:05:38.492 --> 00:05:41.005
unless we process it,
unless we apply it to something,

00:05:41.005 --> 00:05:44.650
unless we talk to somebody about it.

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:47.892
When we think about working memory,

00:05:47.892 --> 00:05:51.196
we have to realize that this limited capacity

00:05:51.196 --> 00:05:53.691
has lots of different impacts on us.

00:05:53.691 --> 00:05:56.716
Have you ever walked from one room to another

00:05:56.716 --> 00:05:59.727
and then forgotten why you're there?

00:05:59.727 --> 00:06:01.896
You do know the solution to that, right?

00:06:01.896 --> 00:06:04.242
You go back to that original room. (Laughter)

00:06:04.242 --> 00:06:08.179
Have you ever forgotten your keys?

00:06:08.179 --> 00:06:10.708
You ever forgotten your car?

00:06:10.708 --> 00:06:13.679
You ever forgotten your kids?

00:06:13.679 --> 00:06:15.868
Have you ever been involved in a conversation,

00:06:15.868 --> 00:06:17.812
and you realize that the conversation to your left

00:06:17.812 --> 00:06:20.646
is actually more interesting? (Laughter)

00:06:20.646 --> 00:06:22.270
So you're nodding and you're smiling,

00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:24.658
but you're really paying attention
to this one over here,

00:06:24.658 --> 00:06:26.958
until you hear that last word go up,

00:06:26.958 --> 00:06:28.618
and you realize,

00:06:28.618 --> 00:06:31.572
you've been asked a question. (Laughter)

00:06:31.572 --> 00:06:33.519
And you're really hoping the answer is no,

00:06:33.519 --> 00:06:36.738
because that's what you're about to say.

00:06:36.738 --> 00:06:39.214
All of that talks about working memory,

00:06:39.214 --> 00:06:41.472
what we can do and what we can't do.

00:06:41.472 --> 00:06:43.009
We need to realize that working memory

00:06:43.009 --> 00:06:44.408
has a limited capacity,

00:06:44.408 --> 00:06:47.927
and that working memory capacity itself
is how we negotiate that.

00:06:47.927 --> 00:06:50.098
We negotiate that through strategies.

00:06:50.098 --> 00:06:52.419
So what I want to do is talk a little bit
about a couple of strategies here,

00:06:52.419 --> 00:06:53.694
and these will be really important

00:06:53.694 --> 00:06:57.449
because you are now in an
information target-rich environment

00:06:57.449 --> 00:06:59.569
for the next several days.

00:06:59.569 --> 00:07:02.473
Now the first part of this that we need to think about

00:07:02.473 --> 00:07:05.240
and we need to process our existence, our life,

00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:06.955
immediately and repeatedly.

00:07:06.955 --> 00:07:09.396
We need to process what's going on

00:07:09.396 --> 00:07:12.310
the moment it happens, not 10 minutes later,

00:07:12.310 --> 00:07:14.579
not a week later, at the moment.

00:07:14.579 --> 00:07:18.312
So we need to think about, well,
do I agree with him?

00:07:18.312 --> 00:07:21.092
What's missing? What would I like to know?

00:07:21.092 --> 00:07:23.314
Do I agree with the assumptions?

00:07:23.314 --> 00:07:25.124
How can I apply this in my life?

00:07:25.124 --> 00:07:27.104
It's a way of processing what's going on

00:07:27.104 --> 00:07:28.871
so that we can use it later.

00:07:28.871 --> 00:07:31.831
Now we also need to repeat it. We need to practice.

00:07:31.831 --> 00:07:34.243
So we need to think about it here.

00:07:34.243 --> 00:07:37.038
In between, we want to talk to people about it.

00:07:37.038 --> 00:07:39.261
We're going to write it down,
and when you get home,

00:07:39.261 --> 00:07:41.221
pull out those notes and think about them

00:07:41.221 --> 00:07:43.610
and end up practicing over time.

00:07:43.610 --> 00:07:46.161
Practice for some reason
became a very negative thing.

00:07:46.161 --> 00:07:47.613
It's very positive.

00:07:47.613 --> 00:07:50.663
The next thing is, we need to think elaboratively

00:07:50.663 --> 00:07:53.003
and we need to think illustratively.

00:07:53.003 --> 00:07:56.457
Oftentimes, we think that we have to relate
new knowledge to prior knowledge.

00:07:56.457 --> 00:07:58.387
What we want to do is spin that around.

00:07:58.387 --> 00:08:00.144
We want to take all of our existence

00:08:00.144 --> 00:08:01.897
and wrap it around that new knowledge

00:08:01.897 --> 00:08:05.345
and make all of these connections
and it becomes more meaningful.

00:08:05.345 --> 00:08:09.139
We also want to use imagery.
We are built for images.

00:08:09.139 --> 00:08:10.997
We need to take advantage of that.

00:08:10.997 --> 00:08:12.507
Think about things in images,

00:08:12.507 --> 00:08:14.856
write things down that way.

00:08:14.856 --> 00:08:16.418
If you read a book, pull things up.

00:08:16.418 --> 00:08:18.471
I just got through reading "The Great Gatsby,"

00:08:18.471 --> 00:08:21.570
and I have a perfect idea of what he looks like

00:08:21.570 --> 00:08:24.568
in my head, so my own version.

00:08:24.568 --> 00:08:26.571
The last one is organization and support.

00:08:26.571 --> 00:08:29.140
We are meaning-making machines. It's what we do.

00:08:29.140 --> 00:08:32.281
We try to make meaning out of
everything that happens to us.

00:08:32.281 --> 00:08:34.571
Organization helps, so we need to structure

00:08:34.571 --> 00:08:36.150
what we're doing in ways that make sense.

00:08:36.150 --> 00:08:38.736
If we are providing knowledge and experience,

00:08:38.736 --> 00:08:40.221
we need to structure that.

00:08:40.221 --> 00:08:42.720
And the last one is support.

00:08:42.720 --> 00:08:44.442
We all started as novices.

00:08:44.442 --> 00:08:47.483
Everything we do is an
approximation of sophistication.

00:08:47.483 --> 00:08:50.420
We should expect it to change over time.
We have to support that.

00:08:50.420 --> 00:08:53.076
The support may come in asking people questions,

00:08:53.076 --> 00:08:56.574
giving them a sheet of paper that has
an organizational chart on it

00:08:56.579 --> 00:08:59.127
or has some guiding images,

00:08:59.127 --> 00:09:01.027
but we need to support it.

00:09:01.027 --> 00:09:06.318
Now, the final piece of this, the take-home message

00:09:06.318 --> 00:09:09.244
from a working memory capacity standpoint is this:

00:09:09.244 --> 00:09:12.175
what we process, we learn.

00:09:12.175 --> 00:09:16.976
If we're not processing life, we're not living it.

00:09:16.976 --> 00:09:18.868
Live life. Thank you.

00:09:18.868 --> 00:09:23.053
