00:00:13.096 --> 00:00:15.490
What is so special about the human brain?

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:17.702
Why is it that we study other animals

00:00:17.702 --> 00:00:19.823
instead of them studying us?

00:00:19.823 --> 00:00:21.621
What does a human brain have or do

00:00:21.621 --> 00:00:23.354
that no other brain does?

00:00:23.354 --> 00:00:26.202
When I became interested
in these questions about 10 years ago,

00:00:26.202 --> 00:00:29.144
scientists thought they knew
what different brains were made of.

00:00:29.144 --> 00:00:30.873
Though it was based on very little evidence,

00:00:30.873 --> 00:00:33.060
many scientists thought that all mammalian brains,

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:34.785
including the human brain,

00:00:34.785 --> 00:00:36.085
were made in the same way,

00:00:36.085 --> 00:00:37.587
with a number of neurons that was always

00:00:37.587 --> 00:00:39.818
proportional to the size of the brain.

00:00:39.818 --> 00:00:41.894
This means that two brains of the same size,

00:00:41.894 --> 00:00:45.442
like these two, with a respectable 400 grams,

00:00:45.442 --> 00:00:47.994
should have similar numbers of neurons.

00:00:47.994 --> 00:00:49.790
Now, if neurons are the functional

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:52.693
information processing units of the brain,

00:00:52.693 --> 00:00:54.285
then the owners of these two brains

00:00:54.285 --> 00:00:57.014
should have similar cognitive abilities.

00:00:57.014 --> 00:00:59.363
And yet, one is a chimp,

00:00:59.363 --> 00:01:02.000
and the other is a cow.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.362
Now maybe cows have a really rich

00:01:04.362 --> 00:01:06.615
internal mental life and are so smart

00:01:06.615 --> 00:01:10.418
that they choose not to let us realize it,

00:01:10.418 --> 00:01:11.863
but we eat them.

00:01:11.863 --> 00:01:13.562
I think most people will agree

00:01:13.562 --> 00:01:15.563
that chimps are capable of much more complex,

00:01:15.563 --> 00:01:18.619
elaborate and flexible behaviors than cows are.

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:20.551
So this is a first indication that the

00:01:20.551 --> 00:01:22.584
"all brains are made the same way" scenario

00:01:22.584 --> 00:01:24.255
is not quite right.

00:01:24.255 --> 00:01:25.601
But let's play along.

00:01:25.601 --> 00:01:27.379
If all brains were made the same way

00:01:27.379 --> 00:01:30.291
and you were to compare animals
with brains of different sizes,

00:01:30.291 --> 00:01:32.473
larger brains should always have more neurons

00:01:32.473 --> 00:01:34.796
than smaller brains,
and the larger the brain,

00:01:34.796 --> 00:01:37.818
the more cognitively able its owner should be.

00:01:37.818 --> 00:01:39.954
So the largest brain around should also be

00:01:39.954 --> 00:01:42.243
the most cognitively able.

00:01:42.243 --> 00:01:43.824
And here comes the bad news:

00:01:43.824 --> 00:01:46.581
Our brain, not the largest one around.

00:01:46.581 --> 00:01:48.136
It seems quite vexing.

00:01:48.136 --> 00:01:50.871
Our brain weighs between 1.2 and 1.5 kilos,

00:01:50.871 --> 00:01:54.188
but elephant brains weigh between four and five kilos,

00:01:54.188 --> 00:01:56.773
and whale brains can weigh up to nine kilos,

00:01:56.773 --> 00:02:01.511
which is why scientists used to resort to saying

00:02:01.511 --> 00:02:03.668
that our brain must be special

00:02:03.668 --> 00:02:06.530
to explain our cognitive abilities.

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:09.476
It must be really extraordinary,

00:02:09.476 --> 00:02:11.453
an exception to the rule.

00:02:11.453 --> 00:02:14.679
Theirs may be bigger, but ours is better,

00:02:14.679 --> 00:02:16.554
and it could be better, for example,

00:02:16.554 --> 00:02:18.665
in that it seems larger than it should be,

00:02:18.665 --> 00:02:21.363
with a much larger cerebral cortex
than we should have

00:02:21.363 --> 00:02:22.902
for the size of our bodies.

00:02:22.902 --> 00:02:24.554
So that would give us extra cortex

00:02:24.554 --> 00:02:27.514
to do more interesting things
than just operating the body.

00:02:27.514 --> 00:02:29.193
That's because the size of the brain

00:02:29.193 --> 00:02:31.526
usually follows the size of the body.

00:02:31.526 --> 00:02:33.843
So the main reason for saying that

00:02:33.843 --> 00:02:35.930
our brain is larger than it should be

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:37.702
actually comes from comparing ourselves

00:02:37.702 --> 00:02:39.388
to great apes.

00:02:39.388 --> 00:02:41.982
Gorillas can be two to three times larger than we are,

00:02:41.982 --> 00:02:44.403
so their brains should also be larger than ours,

00:02:44.403 --> 00:02:46.348
but instead it's the other way around.

00:02:46.348 --> 00:02:49.283
Our brain is three times larger than a gorilla brain.

00:02:49.283 --> 00:02:51.403
The human brain also seems special

00:02:51.403 --> 00:02:53.650
in the amount of energy that it uses.

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:56.399
Although it weighs only two percent of the body,

00:02:56.399 --> 00:02:59.842
it alone uses 25 percent of all the energy

00:02:59.842 --> 00:03:02.305
that your body requires to run per day.

00:03:02.305 --> 00:03:05.658
That's 500 calories out of a total of 2,000 calories,

00:03:05.658 --> 00:03:08.063
just to keep your brain working.

00:03:08.063 --> 00:03:10.991
So the human brain is larger than it should be,

00:03:10.991 --> 00:03:13.017
it uses much more energy than it should,

00:03:13.017 --> 00:03:14.475
so it's special.

00:03:14.475 --> 00:03:17.046
And this is where the story started to bother me.

00:03:17.046 --> 00:03:18.717
In biology, we look for rules

00:03:18.717 --> 00:03:21.563
that apply to all animals and to life in general,

00:03:21.563 --> 00:03:23.413
so why should the rules of evolution

00:03:23.413 --> 00:03:27.055
apply to everybody else but not to us?

00:03:27.055 --> 00:03:29.252
Maybe the problem was with the basic assumption

00:03:29.252 --> 00:03:31.123
that all brains are made in the same way.

00:03:31.123 --> 00:03:32.722
Maybe two brains of a similar size

00:03:32.722 --> 00:03:35.313
can actually be made of
very different numbers of neurons.

00:03:35.313 --> 00:03:36.920
Maybe a very large brain

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:38.760
does not necessarily have more neurons

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:40.981
than a more modest-sized brain.

00:03:40.981 --> 00:03:43.990
Maybe the human brain 
actually has the most neurons

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:46.563
of any brain, regardless of its size,

00:03:46.563 --> 00:03:48.657
especially in the cerebral cortex.

00:03:48.657 --> 00:03:50.209
So this to me became

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:51.938
the important question to answer:

00:03:51.938 --> 00:03:54.338
how many neurons does the human brain have,

00:03:54.338 --> 00:03:56.860
and how does that compare to other animals?

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:59.283
Now, you may have heard or read somewhere

00:03:59.283 --> 00:04:01.394
that we have 100 billion neurons,

00:04:01.394 --> 00:04:03.480
so 10 years ago, I asked my colleagues

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:05.319
if they knew where this number came from.

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:06.777
But nobody did.

00:04:06.777 --> 00:04:08.230
I've been digging through the literature

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:10.288
for the original reference for that number,

00:04:10.288 --> 00:04:12.071
and I could never find it.

00:04:12.071 --> 00:04:14.810
It seems that nobody had actually ever counted

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:16.344
the number of neurons in the human brain,

00:04:16.344 --> 00:04:18.843
or in any other brain for that matter.

00:04:18.843 --> 00:04:22.378
So I came up with my own way
to count cells in the brain,

00:04:22.378 --> 00:04:24.486
and it essentially consists of

00:04:24.486 --> 00:04:27.731
dissolving that brain into soup.

00:04:27.731 --> 00:04:29.768
It works like this:

00:04:29.768 --> 00:04:32.895
You take a brain, or parts of that brain,

00:04:32.895 --> 00:04:34.639
and you dissolve it in detergent,

00:04:34.639 --> 00:04:36.148
which destroys the cell membranes

00:04:36.148 --> 00:04:38.584
but keeps the cell nuclei intact,

00:04:38.584 --> 00:04:41.724
so you end up with a suspension of free nuclei

00:04:41.724 --> 00:04:43.505
that looks like this,

00:04:43.505 --> 00:04:44.778
like a clear soup.

00:04:44.778 --> 00:04:46.669
This soup contains all the nuclei

00:04:46.669 --> 00:04:48.723
that once were a mouse brain.

00:04:48.723 --> 00:04:51.753
Now, the beauty of a soup is that because it is soup,

00:04:51.753 --> 00:04:54.651
you can agitate it and make those nuclei

00:04:54.651 --> 00:04:56.622
be distributed homogeneously in the liquid,

00:04:56.622 --> 00:04:58.603
so that now by looking under the microscope

00:04:58.603 --> 00:05:02.686
at just four or five samples
of this homogeneous solution,

00:05:02.686 --> 00:05:05.222
you can count nuclei, and therefore tell

00:05:05.222 --> 00:05:06.901
how many cells that brain had.

00:05:06.901 --> 00:05:08.526
It's simple, it's straightforward,

00:05:08.526 --> 00:05:09.960
and it's really fast.

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:11.957
So we've used that method to count neurons

00:05:11.957 --> 00:05:14.268
in dozens of different species so far,

00:05:14.268 --> 00:05:15.957
and it turns out that all brains

00:05:15.957 --> 00:05:18.539
are not made the same way.

00:05:18.539 --> 00:05:20.726
Take rodents and primates, for instance:

00:05:20.726 --> 00:05:23.010
In larger rodent brains, the average size

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:24.696
of the neuron increases,

00:05:24.696 --> 00:05:27.295
so the brain inflates very rapidly

00:05:27.295 --> 00:05:30.460
and gains size much faster than it gains neurons.

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:32.163
But primate brains gain neurons

00:05:32.163 --> 00:05:34.622
without the average neuron becoming any larger,

00:05:34.622 --> 00:05:36.147
which is a very economical way

00:05:36.147 --> 00:05:37.800
to add neurons to your brain.

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:39.564
The result is that a primate brain

00:05:39.564 --> 00:05:42.731
will always have more neurons than
a rodent brain of the same size,

00:05:42.731 --> 00:05:44.214
and the larger the brain,

00:05:44.214 --> 00:05:46.428
the larger this difference will be.

00:05:46.428 --> 00:05:48.531
Well, what about our brain then?

00:05:48.531 --> 00:05:50.215
We found that we have, on average,

00:05:50.215 --> 00:05:52.000
86 billion neurons,

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.999
16 billion of which are in the cerebral cortex,

00:05:54.999 --> 00:05:57.080
and if you consider that the cerebral cortex

00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:00.174
is the seat of functions like

00:06:00.174 --> 00:06:03.311
awareness and logical and abstract reasoning,

00:06:03.311 --> 00:06:06.295
and that 16 billion is the most neurons

00:06:06.295 --> 00:06:08.916
that any cortex has,

00:06:08.916 --> 00:06:10.634
I think this is the simplest explanation

00:06:10.634 --> 00:06:13.776
for our remarkable cognitive abilities.

00:06:13.776 --> 00:06:16.997
But just as important is what
the 86 billion neurons mean.

00:06:16.997 --> 00:06:18.526
Because we found that the relationship

00:06:18.526 --> 00:06:20.878
between the size of the brain
and its number of neurons

00:06:20.878 --> 00:06:22.505
could be described mathematically,

00:06:22.505 --> 00:06:24.723
we could calculate what a human brain

00:06:24.723 --> 00:06:27.397
would look like if it was made like a rodent brain.

00:06:27.397 --> 00:06:30.971
So, a rodent brain with 86 billion neurons

00:06:30.971 --> 00:06:34.092
would weigh 36 kilos.

00:06:34.092 --> 00:06:35.725
That's not possible.

00:06:35.725 --> 00:06:37.631
A brain that huge would be crushed

00:06:37.631 --> 00:06:38.815
by its own weight,

00:06:38.815 --> 00:06:40.402
and this impossible brain would go

00:06:40.402 --> 00:06:44.173
in the body of 89 tons.

00:06:44.173 --> 00:06:46.307
I don't think it looks like us.

00:06:46.307 --> 00:06:48.860
So this brings us to a very important
conclusion already,

00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:51.507
which is that we are not rodents.

00:06:51.507 --> 00:06:54.775
The human brain is not a large rat brain.

00:06:54.775 --> 00:06:57.403
Compared to a rat, we might seem special, yes,

00:06:57.403 --> 00:06:59.623
but that's not a fair comparison to make,

00:06:59.623 --> 00:07:01.712
given that we know that we are not rodents.

00:07:01.712 --> 00:07:03.102
We are primates,

00:07:03.102 --> 00:07:05.876
so the correct comparison is to other primates.

00:07:05.876 --> 00:07:07.103
And there, if you do the math,

00:07:07.103 --> 00:07:09.889
you find that a generic primate

00:07:09.889 --> 00:07:11.819
with 86 billion neurons

00:07:11.819 --> 00:07:14.822
would have a brain of about 1.2 kilos,

00:07:14.822 --> 00:07:16.711
which seems just right,

00:07:16.711 --> 00:07:18.683
in a body of some 66 kilos,

00:07:18.683 --> 00:07:21.328
which in my case is exactly right,

00:07:21.328 --> 00:07:23.948
which brings us to a very unsurprising

00:07:23.948 --> 00:07:26.917
but still incredibly important conclusion:

00:07:26.917 --> 00:07:28.258
I am a primate.

00:07:28.258 --> 00:07:30.956
And all of you are primates.

00:07:30.956 --> 00:07:32.856
And so was Darwin.

00:07:32.856 --> 00:07:35.796
I love to think that Darwin
would have really appreciated this.

00:07:35.796 --> 00:07:37.763
His brain, like ours,

00:07:37.763 --> 00:07:41.274
was made in the image of other primate brains.

00:07:41.274 --> 00:07:43.576
So the human brain may be remarkable, yes,

00:07:43.576 --> 00:07:46.357
but it is not special in its number of neurons.

00:07:46.357 --> 00:07:48.212
It is just a large primate brain.

00:07:48.212 --> 00:07:51.256
I think that's a very humbling and sobering thought

00:07:51.256 --> 00:07:54.319
that should remind us of our place in nature.

00:07:54.319 --> 00:07:56.963
Why does it cost so much energy, then?

00:07:56.963 --> 00:07:58.410
Well, other people have figured out

00:07:58.410 --> 00:07:59.913
how much energy the human brain

00:07:59.913 --> 00:08:01.320
and that of other species costs,

00:08:01.320 --> 00:08:02.972
and now that we knew how many neurons

00:08:02.972 --> 00:08:05.314
each brain was made of, we could do the math.

00:08:05.314 --> 00:08:07.180
And it turns out that both human

00:08:07.180 --> 00:08:10.003
and other brains cost about the same,

00:08:10.003 --> 00:08:13.424
an average of six calories 
per billion neurons per day.

00:08:13.424 --> 00:08:15.563
So the total energetic cost of a brain

00:08:15.563 --> 00:08:17.597
is a simple, linear function

00:08:17.597 --> 00:08:19.306
of its number of neurons,

00:08:19.306 --> 00:08:21.489
and it turns out that the human brain

00:08:21.489 --> 00:08:25.330
costs just as much energy as you would expect.

00:08:25.330 --> 00:08:27.421
So the reason why the human brain

00:08:27.421 --> 00:08:29.093
costs so much energy is simply because

00:08:29.093 --> 00:08:31.076
it has a huge number of neurons,

00:08:31.076 --> 00:08:32.561
and because we are primates

00:08:32.561 --> 00:08:35.060
with many more neurons for a given body size

00:08:35.060 --> 00:08:36.582
than any other animal,

00:08:36.582 --> 00:08:40.122
the relative cost of our brain is large,

00:08:40.122 --> 00:08:43.123
but just because we're primates,
not because we're special.

00:08:43.123 --> 00:08:44.313
Last question, then:

00:08:44.313 --> 00:08:47.428
how did we come by this
remarkable number of neurons,

00:08:47.428 --> 00:08:49.328
and in particular, if great apes

00:08:49.328 --> 00:08:50.883
are larger than we are,

00:08:50.883 --> 00:08:54.648
why don't they have a larger brain 
than we do, with more neurons?

00:08:54.648 --> 00:08:56.738
When we realized how much expensive it is

00:08:56.738 --> 00:08:59.071
to have a lot of neurons in the brain, I figured,

00:08:59.071 --> 00:09:01.074
maybe there's a simple reason.

00:09:01.074 --> 00:09:02.757
They just can't afford the energy

00:09:02.757 --> 00:09:05.707
for both a large body 
and a large number of neurons.

00:09:05.707 --> 00:09:07.136
So we did the math.

00:09:07.136 --> 00:09:08.736
We calculated on the one hand

00:09:08.736 --> 00:09:10.677
how much energy a primate gets per day

00:09:10.677 --> 00:09:12.027
from eating raw foods,

00:09:12.027 --> 00:09:14.064
and on the other hand, how much energy

00:09:14.064 --> 00:09:15.828
a body of a certain size costs

00:09:15.828 --> 00:09:19.215
and how much energy a brain of a
certain number of neurons costs,

00:09:19.215 --> 00:09:20.704
and we looked for the combinations

00:09:20.704 --> 00:09:23.115
of body size and number of brain neurons

00:09:23.115 --> 00:09:24.385
that a primate could afford

00:09:24.385 --> 00:09:26.933
if it ate a certain number of hours per day.

00:09:26.933 --> 00:09:28.749
And what we found is that

00:09:28.749 --> 00:09:30.461
because neurons are so expensive,

00:09:30.461 --> 00:09:33.831
there is a tradeoff between
body size and number of neurons.

00:09:33.831 --> 00:09:36.782
So a primate that eats eight hours per day

00:09:36.782 --> 00:09:39.806
can afford at most 53 billion neurons,

00:09:39.806 --> 00:09:41.533
but then its body cannot be any bigger

00:09:41.533 --> 00:09:43.487
than 25 kilos.

00:09:43.487 --> 00:09:45.188
To weigh any more than that,

00:09:45.188 --> 00:09:46.957
it has to give up neurons.

00:09:46.957 --> 00:09:49.610
So it's either a large body

00:09:49.610 --> 00:09:51.105
or a large number of neurons.

00:09:51.105 --> 00:09:52.470
When you eat like a primate,

00:09:52.470 --> 00:09:54.706
you can't afford both.

00:09:54.706 --> 00:09:56.670
One way out of this metabolic limitation

00:09:56.670 --> 00:10:00.071
would be to spend even more hours per day eating,

00:10:00.071 --> 00:10:01.434
but that gets dangerous,

00:10:01.434 --> 00:10:04.153
and past a certain point, it's just not possible.

00:10:04.153 --> 00:10:05.690
Gorillas and orangutans, for instance,

00:10:05.690 --> 00:10:07.613
afford about 30 billion neurons

00:10:07.613 --> 00:10:10.579
by spending eight and a half hours per day eating,

00:10:10.579 --> 00:10:13.695
and that seems to be about as much as they can do.

00:10:13.695 --> 00:10:15.486
Nine hours of feeding per day

00:10:15.486 --> 00:10:18.757
seems to be the practical limit for a primate.

00:10:18.757 --> 00:10:20.548
What about us?

00:10:20.548 --> 00:10:22.148
With our 86 billion neurons

00:10:22.148 --> 00:10:25.183
and 60 to 70 kilos of body mass,

00:10:25.183 --> 00:10:28.744
we should have to spend over nine hours

00:10:28.744 --> 00:10:32.319
per day every single day feeding,

00:10:32.319 --> 00:10:34.358
which is just not feasible.

00:10:34.358 --> 00:10:36.192
If we ate like a primate,

00:10:36.192 --> 00:10:38.445
we should not be here.

00:10:38.445 --> 00:10:40.572
How did we get here, then?

00:10:40.572 --> 00:10:43.307
Well, if our brain costs just as much energy

00:10:43.307 --> 00:10:45.030
as it should, and if we can't spend

00:10:45.030 --> 00:10:48.704
every waking hour of the day feeding,

00:10:48.704 --> 00:10:50.615
then the only alternative, really,

00:10:50.615 --> 00:10:52.573
is to somehow get more energy

00:10:52.573 --> 00:10:54.526
out of the same foods.

00:10:54.526 --> 00:10:58.326
And remarkably, that matches exactly

00:10:58.326 --> 00:11:01.363
what our ancestors are believed to have invented

00:11:01.363 --> 00:11:03.202
one and a half million years ago,

00:11:03.202 --> 00:11:05.984
when they invented cooking.

00:11:05.984 --> 00:11:07.954
To cook is to use fire

00:11:07.954 --> 00:11:11.754
to pre-digest foods outside of your body.

00:11:11.754 --> 00:11:14.360
Cooked foods are softer, so they're easier to chew

00:11:14.360 --> 00:11:16.923
and to turn completely into mush in your mouth,

00:11:16.923 --> 00:11:19.075
so that allows them to be completely digested

00:11:19.075 --> 00:11:20.511
and absorbed in your gut,

00:11:20.511 --> 00:11:24.166
which makes them yield much more
energy in much less time.

00:11:24.166 --> 00:11:26.655
So cooking frees time for us to do

00:11:26.655 --> 00:11:28.717
much more interesting things with our day

00:11:28.717 --> 00:11:30.197
and with our neurons

00:11:30.197 --> 00:11:32.102
than just thinking about food,

00:11:32.102 --> 00:11:33.806
looking for food, and gobbling down food

00:11:33.806 --> 00:11:35.031
all day long.

00:11:35.031 --> 00:11:37.530
So because of cooking, what once was

00:11:37.530 --> 00:11:39.883
a major liability, this large,

00:11:39.883 --> 00:11:42.916
dangerously expensive brain with a lot of neurons,

00:11:42.916 --> 00:11:44.952
could now become a major asset,

00:11:44.952 --> 00:11:48.203
now that we could both afford 
the energy for a lot of neurons

00:11:48.206 --> 00:11:50.709
and the time to do interesting things with them.

00:11:50.709 --> 00:11:52.683
So I think this explains why the human brain

00:11:52.683 --> 00:11:55.923
grew to become so large so fast in evolution,

00:11:55.923 --> 00:11:59.820
all of the while remaining just a primate brain.

00:11:59.820 --> 00:12:02.594
With this large brain now affordable by cooking,

00:12:02.594 --> 00:12:05.507
we went rapidly from raw foods to culture,

00:12:05.507 --> 00:12:08.113
agriculture, civilization, grocery stores,

00:12:08.113 --> 00:12:09.738
electricity, refrigerators,

00:12:09.738 --> 00:12:11.345
all of those things that nowadays

00:12:11.345 --> 00:12:13.387
allow us to get all the energy we need

00:12:13.387 --> 00:12:16.169
for the whole day in a single sitting

00:12:16.169 --> 00:12:19.123
at your favorite fast food joint.

00:12:19.123 --> 00:12:21.560
So what once was a solution

00:12:21.560 --> 00:12:23.259
now became the problem,

00:12:23.259 --> 00:12:28.776
and ironically, we look for the solution in raw food.

00:12:28.776 --> 00:12:31.332
So what is the human advantage?

00:12:31.332 --> 00:12:32.835
What is it that we have

00:12:32.835 --> 00:12:35.370
that no other animal has?

00:12:35.370 --> 00:12:37.718
My answer is that we have the largest number

00:12:37.718 --> 00:12:39.190
of neurons in the cerebral cortex,

00:12:39.190 --> 00:12:41.034
and I think that's the simplest explanation

00:12:41.034 --> 00:12:43.047
for our remarkable cognitive abilities.

00:12:43.047 --> 00:12:46.274
And what is it that we do that no other animal does,

00:12:46.274 --> 00:12:48.243
and which I believe was fundamental

00:12:48.243 --> 00:12:51.326
to allow us to reach that large,

00:12:51.326 --> 00:12:53.548
largest number of neurons in the cortex?

00:12:53.548 --> 00:12:55.763
In two words, we cook.

00:12:55.763 --> 00:12:59.329
No other animal cooks its food. Only humans do.

00:12:59.329 --> 00:13:02.199
And I think that's how we got to become human.

00:13:02.199 --> 00:13:04.659
Studying the human brain changed 
the way I think about food.

00:13:04.659 --> 00:13:06.304
I now look at my kitchen,

00:13:06.304 --> 00:13:07.774
and I bow to it,

00:13:07.774 --> 00:13:09.479
and I thank my ancestors for coming up

00:13:09.479 --> 00:13:11.379
with the invention that probably made us humans.

00:13:11.379 --> 00:13:13.511
Thank you very much.

00:13:13.511 --> 00:13:19.864
(Applause)
