00:00:12.547 --> 00:00:16.107
I'm here today to talk about social change,

00:00:16.107 --> 00:00:19.390
not a new therapy or a new intervention

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:22.107
or a new way of working with kids
or something like that,

00:00:22.107 --> 00:00:25.052
but a new business model for social change,

00:00:25.052 --> 00:00:27.959
a new way of tackling the problem.

00:00:27.959 --> 00:00:32.133
In Britain, 63 percent of all men

00:00:32.133 --> 00:00:35.196
who come out of short sentences from prison

00:00:35.196 --> 00:00:37.717
re-offend again within a year.

00:00:37.717 --> 00:00:40.335
Now how many previous offenses

00:00:40.335 --> 00:00:42.718
do you think they have on average

00:00:42.718 --> 00:00:45.303
managed to commit?

00:00:45.303 --> 00:00:47.451
Forty-three.

00:00:47.451 --> 00:00:51.114
And how many previous times
do you think they've been in prison?

00:00:51.114 --> 00:00:52.301
Seven.

00:00:52.301 --> 00:00:55.115
So we went to talk to the Ministry of Justice,

00:00:55.115 --> 00:00:57.003
and we said to the Ministry of Justice,

00:00:57.003 --> 00:00:59.355
what's it worth to you

00:00:59.355 --> 00:01:01.532
if fewer of these guys re-offend?

00:01:01.532 --> 00:01:03.701
It's got to be worth something, right?

00:01:03.701 --> 00:01:05.528
I mean, there's prison costs,

00:01:05.528 --> 00:01:09.056
there's police costs, there's court costs,

00:01:09.056 --> 00:01:11.788
all these things that you're spending money on

00:01:11.788 --> 00:01:14.301
to deal with these guys. What's it worth?

00:01:14.301 --> 00:01:17.296
Now, of course, we care about the social value.

00:01:17.296 --> 00:01:20.582
Social Finance, the organization I helped set up,

00:01:20.582 --> 00:01:22.825
cares about social stuff.

00:01:22.825 --> 00:01:25.867
But we wanted to make the economic case,

00:01:25.867 --> 00:01:27.645
because if we could make the economic case,

00:01:27.645 --> 00:01:30.666
then the value of doing this 
would be completely compelling.

00:01:30.666 --> 00:01:33.501
And if we can agree on both a value

00:01:33.501 --> 00:01:35.838
and a way of measuring whether we've been

00:01:35.838 --> 00:01:38.236
successful at reducing that re-offending,

00:01:38.236 --> 00:01:40.207
then we can do something

00:01:40.207 --> 00:01:42.770
we think rather interesting.

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:46.694
The idea is called the social impact bond.

00:01:46.694 --> 00:01:49.071
Now, the social impact bond is simply saying,

00:01:49.071 --> 00:01:50.710
if we can get the government to agree,

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:53.461
that we can create a contract where

00:01:53.461 --> 00:01:56.920
they only pay if it worked.

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:00.089
So that means that they can try out new stuff

00:02:00.089 --> 00:02:01.552
without the embarrassment

00:02:01.552 --> 00:02:03.560
of having to pay if it didn't work,

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:05.232
which for still quite a lot of bits of government,

00:02:05.232 --> 00:02:06.579
that's a serious issue.

00:02:06.579 --> 00:02:08.174
Now, many of you may have noticed

00:02:08.174 --> 00:02:09.660
there's a problem at this point,

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.874
and that is that it takes a long time to measure

00:02:11.874 --> 00:02:14.640
whether those outcomes have happened.

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:17.856
So we have to raise some money.

00:02:17.856 --> 00:02:20.303
We use the contract to raise money

00:02:20.303 --> 00:02:22.527
from socially motivated investors.

00:02:22.527 --> 00:02:24.881
Socially motivated investors:

00:02:24.881 --> 00:02:27.179
there's an interesting idea, right?

00:02:27.179 --> 00:02:29.570
But actually, there's a lot of people who,

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:30.803
if they're given the chance,

00:02:30.803 --> 00:02:32.685
would love to invest in something

00:02:32.685 --> 00:02:35.448
that does social good.

00:02:35.448 --> 00:02:37.421
And here's the opportunity.

00:02:37.421 --> 00:02:39.678
Do you want to also help government find

00:02:39.678 --> 00:02:42.114
whether there's a better economic model,

00:02:42.114 --> 00:02:44.490
not just leaving these guys to come out of prison

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:47.361
and waiting till they re-offend
and putting them back in again,

00:02:47.361 --> 00:02:48.918
but actually working with them

00:02:48.918 --> 00:02:50.477
to move to a different path

00:02:50.477 --> 00:02:53.076
to end up with fewer crimes

00:02:53.076 --> 00:02:55.091
and fewer victims?

00:02:55.091 --> 00:02:57.602
So we find some investors,

00:02:57.602 --> 00:02:59.972
and they pay for a set of services,

00:02:59.972 --> 00:03:02.237
and if those services are successful,

00:03:02.237 --> 00:03:04.730
then they improve outcomes,

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:07.371
and with those measured reductions in re-offending,

00:03:07.371 --> 00:03:08.446
government saves money,

00:03:08.446 --> 00:03:09.983
and with those savings,

00:03:09.983 --> 00:03:12.437
they can pay outcomes.

00:03:12.437 --> 00:03:14.613
And the investors do not just get their money back,

00:03:14.613 --> 00:03:16.621
but they make a return.

00:03:16.621 --> 00:03:19.062
So in March 2010, we signed

00:03:19.062 --> 00:03:21.082
the first social impact bond

00:03:21.082 --> 00:03:22.909
with the Ministry of Justice

00:03:22.909 --> 00:03:24.946
around Peterborough Prison.

00:03:24.946 --> 00:03:27.970
It was to work with 3,000 offenders

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:30.898
split into three cohorts of 1,000 each.

00:03:30.898 --> 00:03:32.887
Now, each of those cohorts

00:03:32.887 --> 00:03:34.718
would get measured over the two years

00:03:34.718 --> 00:03:35.920
that they were coming out of prison.

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:37.975
They've got to have a year to commit their crimes,

00:03:37.975 --> 00:03:40.520
six months to get through the court system,

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:42.915
and then they would be compared to a group

00:03:42.915 --> 00:03:44.983
taken from the police national computer,

00:03:44.983 --> 00:03:46.810
as similar as possible,

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:48.344
and we would get paid

00:03:48.344 --> 00:03:51.133
providing we achieved a hurdle rate
of 10-percent reduction,

00:03:51.133 --> 00:03:54.691
for every conviction event that didn't happen.

00:03:54.691 --> 00:03:58.168
So we get paid for crimes saved.

00:03:58.168 --> 00:04:02.272
Now if we achieved that 10-percent reduction

00:04:02.272 --> 00:04:03.957
across all three cohorts,

00:04:03.957 --> 00:04:07.097
then the investors get a seven and a half percent

00:04:07.097 --> 00:04:09.240
annualized return on their investment,

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:10.780
and if we do better than that,

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:12.376
they can get up to 13 percent

00:04:12.376 --> 00:04:14.909
annualized return on their investment,

00:04:14.909 --> 00:04:17.027
which is okay.

00:04:17.027 --> 00:04:20.235
So everyone wins here, right?

00:04:20.235 --> 00:04:22.950
The Ministry of Justice can try out a new program

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:25.393
and they only pay if it works.

00:04:25.393 --> 00:04:27.805
Investors get two opportunities:

00:04:27.805 --> 00:04:30.861
for the first time, they can invest in social change.

00:04:30.861 --> 00:04:32.892
Also, they make a reasonable return,

00:04:32.892 --> 00:04:35.065
and they also know that

00:04:35.065 --> 00:04:37.337
first investors in these kinds of things,

00:04:37.337 --> 00:04:38.994
they're going to have to believers.

00:04:38.994 --> 00:04:41.097
They're going to have to care in the social program,

00:04:41.097 --> 00:04:43.089
but if this builds a track record

00:04:43.089 --> 00:04:44.537
over five or 10 years,

00:04:44.537 --> 00:04:46.601
then you can widen that investor community

00:04:46.601 --> 00:04:49.057
as more people have confidence in the product.

00:04:49.057 --> 00:04:51.245
The service providers, well, for the first time,

00:04:51.245 --> 00:04:54.104
they've got an opportunity to provide services

00:04:54.104 --> 00:04:56.331
and grow the evidence for what they're doing

00:04:56.331 --> 00:04:58.891
in a really constructive way and learn

00:04:58.891 --> 00:05:00.713
and demonstrate the value of what they're doing

00:05:00.713 --> 00:05:02.732
over five or six years, not just one or two

00:05:02.732 --> 00:05:04.573
as often happens at the moment.

00:05:04.573 --> 00:05:08.051
Society wins: fewer crimes, fewer victims.

00:05:08.051 --> 00:05:10.877
Now, the offenders, they also benefit.

00:05:10.877 --> 00:05:12.307
Instead of just coming out of the prison

00:05:12.307 --> 00:05:14.231
with 46 pounds in their pocket,

00:05:14.231 --> 00:05:15.730
half of them not knowing where they're spending

00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:17.868
their first night out of jail,

00:05:17.868 --> 00:05:20.787
actually, someone meets them in prison,

00:05:20.787 --> 00:05:22.651
learns about their issues,

00:05:22.651 --> 00:05:24.570
meets them at the gate,

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:27.323
takes them through to somewhere to stay,

00:05:27.323 --> 00:05:29.741
connects them to benefits,
connects them to employment,

00:05:29.741 --> 00:05:31.809
drug rehabilitation, mental health,

00:05:31.809 --> 00:05:33.539
whatever's needed.

00:05:33.539 --> 00:05:36.218
So let's think of another example:

00:05:36.218 --> 00:05:38.108
working with children in care.

00:05:38.108 --> 00:05:39.732
Social impact bonds work great

00:05:39.732 --> 00:05:42.393
for any area where there is at the moment

00:05:42.393 --> 00:05:44.792
very expensive provision that produces

00:05:44.792 --> 00:05:46.366
poor outcomes for people.

00:05:46.366 --> 00:05:48.280
So children in the state care

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:50.715
tend to do very badly.

00:05:50.715 --> 00:05:54.640
Only 13 percent achieve a reasonable level

00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:57.539
of five GCSEs at 16,

00:05:57.539 --> 00:06:00.009
against 58 percent of the wider population.

00:06:00.009 --> 00:06:03.668
More troublingly, 27 percent of offenders in prison

00:06:03.668 --> 00:06:05.709
have spent some time in care.

00:06:05.709 --> 00:06:07.001
And even more worryingly,

00:06:07.001 --> 00:06:08.973
and this is a Home Office statistic,

00:06:08.973 --> 00:06:10.873
70 percent of prostitutes

00:06:10.873 --> 00:06:13.057
have spent some time in care.

00:06:13.057 --> 00:06:16.057
The state is not a great parent.

00:06:16.057 --> 00:06:18.882
But there are great programs

00:06:18.882 --> 00:06:21.894
for adolescents who are on the edge of care,

00:06:21.894 --> 00:06:23.770
and 30 percent of kids going into care

00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:25.429
are adolescents.

00:06:25.429 --> 00:06:28.269
So we set up a program with Essex County Council

00:06:28.269 --> 00:06:31.915
to test out intensive family therapeutic support

00:06:31.915 --> 00:06:34.955
for those families with adolescents

00:06:34.955 --> 00:06:36.526
on the edge of the care system.

00:06:36.526 --> 00:06:39.312
Essex only pays in the event

00:06:39.312 --> 00:06:42.094
that it's saving them care costs.

00:06:42.094 --> 00:06:44.858
Investors have put in 3.1 million pounds.

00:06:44.858 --> 00:06:47.116
That program started last month.

00:06:47.116 --> 00:06:49.440
Others, around homelessness in London,

00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:53.320
around youth and employment and education

00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:54.687
elsewhere in the country.

00:06:54.687 --> 00:06:58.042
There are now 13 social impact bonds in Britain,

00:06:58.042 --> 00:07:00.517
and amazing levels of interest in this idea

00:07:00.517 --> 00:07:02.040
all over the world.

00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:04.755
So David Cameron's put 20 million pounds

00:07:04.755 --> 00:07:08.005
into a social outcomes fund to support this idea.

00:07:08.005 --> 00:07:11.185
Obama has suggested 300 million dollars

00:07:11.185 --> 00:07:14.718
in the U.S. budget for these kinds of ideas

00:07:14.718 --> 00:07:16.404
and structures to move it forward,

00:07:16.404 --> 00:07:17.895
and a lot of other countries

00:07:17.895 --> 00:07:20.112
are demonstrating considerable interest.

00:07:20.112 --> 00:07:22.168
So what's caused this excitement?

00:07:22.168 --> 00:07:24.687
Why is this so different for people?

00:07:24.687 --> 00:07:27.179
Well, the first piece, which we've talked about,

00:07:27.179 --> 00:07:28.397
is innovation.

00:07:28.397 --> 00:07:31.595
It enables testing of new ideas

00:07:31.595 --> 00:07:35.188
in a way that's less difficult for everybody.

00:07:35.188 --> 00:07:37.824
The second piece it brings is rigor.

00:07:37.824 --> 00:07:41.117
By working to outcomes, people really have to test

00:07:41.117 --> 00:07:44.986
and bring data into the situation
that one's dealing with.

00:07:44.995 --> 00:07:47.488
So taking Peterborough as an example,

00:07:47.488 --> 00:07:49.711
we add case management

00:07:49.711 --> 00:07:52.367
across all of the different organizations
that we're working with

00:07:52.367 --> 00:07:53.652
so they know

00:07:53.652 --> 00:07:55.801
what actually has been done with different prisoners,

00:07:55.801 --> 00:07:57.870
and at the same time they learn

00:07:57.870 --> 00:08:00.296
from the Ministry of Justice, and we learn,

00:08:00.296 --> 00:08:02.031
because we pushed for the data,

00:08:02.031 --> 00:08:04.238
what actually happens, whether
they get re-arrested or not.

00:08:04.238 --> 00:08:07.526
And we learn and adapt the program accordingly.

00:08:07.526 --> 00:08:10.463
And this leads to the third element, which is new,

00:08:10.463 --> 00:08:12.565
and that's flexibility.

00:08:12.565 --> 00:08:15.678
Because normal contracting for things,

00:08:15.678 --> 00:08:17.739
when you're spending government money,

00:08:17.739 --> 00:08:20.250
you're spending our money, tax money,

00:08:20.250 --> 00:08:22.947
and the people who are in charge 
of that are very aware of it

00:08:22.947 --> 00:08:26.797
so the temptation is to control
exactly how you spend it.

00:08:26.797 --> 00:08:29.850
Now any entrepreneur in the room knows

00:08:29.850 --> 00:08:31.947
that version 1.0, the business plan,

00:08:31.947 --> 00:08:34.794
is not the one that generally works.

00:08:34.794 --> 00:08:37.097
So when you're trying to do something like this,

00:08:37.097 --> 00:08:39.790
you need the flexibility to adapt the program.

00:08:39.790 --> 00:08:42.502
And again, in Peterborough, we started off

00:08:42.502 --> 00:08:46.659
with a program, but we also collected data,

00:08:46.659 --> 00:08:48.536
and over the period of time,

00:08:48.536 --> 00:08:50.734
we nuanced and changed that program

00:08:50.734 --> 00:08:53.354
to add a range of other elements,

00:08:53.354 --> 00:08:55.119
so that the service adapts

00:08:55.119 --> 00:08:57.620
and we meet the needs of the long term

00:08:57.620 --> 00:08:59.684
as well as the short term:

00:08:59.684 --> 00:09:02.793
greater engagement from the prisoners,

00:09:02.793 --> 00:09:05.572
longer-term engagement as well.

00:09:05.572 --> 00:09:08.108
The last element is partnership.

00:09:08.108 --> 00:09:11.285
There is, at the moment, a stale 
debate going on very often:

00:09:11.285 --> 00:09:13.410
state's better, public sector's better,

00:09:13.410 --> 00:09:16.921
private sector's better, social sector's better,

00:09:16.921 --> 00:09:18.589
for a lot of these programs.

00:09:18.589 --> 00:09:20.571
Actually, for creating social change,

00:09:20.571 --> 00:09:22.310
we need to bring in the expertise

00:09:22.310 --> 00:09:24.006
from all of those parties

00:09:24.006 --> 00:09:25.594
in order to make this work.

00:09:25.594 --> 00:09:27.637
And this creates a structure

00:09:27.637 --> 00:09:29.612
through which they can combine.

00:09:29.612 --> 00:09:31.544
So where does this leave us?

00:09:31.544 --> 00:09:33.378
This leaves us with a way

00:09:33.378 --> 00:09:36.365
that people can invest in social change.

00:09:36.365 --> 00:09:39.352
We've met thousands, possibly millions of people,

00:09:39.352 --> 00:09:41.785
who want the opportunity to invest in social change.

00:09:41.785 --> 00:09:44.874
We've met champions all over the public sector

00:09:44.874 --> 00:09:47.289
keen to make these kinds of differences.

00:09:47.289 --> 00:09:49.074
With this kind of model,

00:09:49.074 --> 00:09:51.010
we can help bring them together.

00:09:51.010 --> 00:09:52.972
Thank you.

00:09:52.972 --> 00:09:57.172
