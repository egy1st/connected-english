00:00:13.494 --> 00:00:18.407
(Aquatic noises)

00:00:20.961 --> 00:00:22.864
So this video was taken

00:00:22.864 --> 00:00:25.296
at Aquarius undersea laboratory

00:00:25.296 --> 00:00:27.149
four miles off the coast of Key Largo,

00:00:27.149 --> 00:00:29.727
about 60 feet below the surface.

00:00:29.727 --> 00:00:31.451
NASA uses this extreme environment

00:00:31.451 --> 00:00:33.875
to train astronauts and aquanauts,

00:00:33.875 --> 00:00:37.237
and last year, they invited us along for the ride.

00:00:37.237 --> 00:00:40.121
All the footage was taken from our open ROV,

00:00:40.121 --> 00:00:44.608
which is a robot that we built in our garage.

00:00:44.608 --> 00:00:48.176
So ROV stands for Remote Operated Vehicle,

00:00:48.176 --> 00:00:49.703
which in our case means our little robot

00:00:49.703 --> 00:00:51.967
sends live video

00:00:51.967 --> 00:00:53.885
across that ultra-thin tether

00:00:53.885 --> 00:00:56.313
back to the computer topside.

00:00:56.313 --> 00:00:58.291
It's open source, meaning we publish

00:00:58.291 --> 00:01:00.336
and share all of our design files

00:01:00.336 --> 00:01:01.844
and all of our code online,

00:01:01.844 --> 00:01:03.878
allowing anyone to modify

00:01:03.878 --> 00:01:06.227
or improve or change the design.

00:01:06.227 --> 00:01:08.530
It's built with mostly off-the-shelf parts

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:10.365
and costs about 1,000 times cheaper

00:01:10.365 --> 00:01:12.244
than the ROVs James Cameron used

00:01:12.244 --> 00:01:15.849
to explore the Titanic.

00:01:15.849 --> 00:01:18.059
So ROVs aren't new.

00:01:18.059 --> 00:01:19.767
They've been around for decades.

00:01:19.767 --> 00:01:22.803
Scientists use ROVs to explore the oceans.

00:01:22.803 --> 00:01:25.622
Oil and gas companies use them for exploration

00:01:25.622 --> 00:01:27.169
and construction.

00:01:27.169 --> 00:01:29.931
What we've built isn't unique.

00:01:29.931 --> 00:01:32.805
It's how we've built it that's really unique.

00:01:32.805 --> 00:01:35.786
So I want to give you a quick story
of how it got started.

00:01:35.786 --> 00:01:38.057
So a few years ago, my friend Eric and I

00:01:38.057 --> 00:01:40.257
decided we wanted to explore this underwater cave

00:01:40.257 --> 00:01:42.115
in the foothills of the Sierras.

00:01:42.115 --> 00:01:44.018
We had heard this story about lost gold

00:01:44.018 --> 00:01:46.536
from a Gold Rush-era robbery,
and we wanted to go up there.

00:01:46.536 --> 00:01:48.194
Unfortunately, we didn't have any money

00:01:48.194 --> 00:01:50.017
and we didn't have any tools to do it.

00:01:50.017 --> 00:01:53.217
So Eric had an initial design idea for a robot,

00:01:53.217 --> 00:01:55.990
but we didn't have all the parts figured out,

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:58.202
so we did what anybody would do in our situation:

00:01:58.202 --> 00:02:00.240
we asked the Internet for help.

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.772
More specifically, we created this website,

00:02:02.772 --> 00:02:05.667
openROV.com, and shared 
our intentions and our plans

00:02:05.667 --> 00:02:08.057
For the first few months, it was just Eric and I

00:02:08.057 --> 00:02:10.587
talking back to each other on the forums,

00:02:10.587 --> 00:02:12.675
but pretty soon, we started to get feedback

00:02:12.675 --> 00:02:14.518
from makers and hobbyists,

00:02:14.518 --> 00:02:16.512
and then actually professional ocean engineers

00:02:16.512 --> 00:02:20.044
who had some suggestions for what we should do.

00:02:20.044 --> 00:02:21.808
We kept working on it. We learned a lot.

00:02:21.808 --> 00:02:23.833
We kept prototyping, and eventually,

00:02:23.833 --> 00:02:26.552
we decided we wanted to go 
to the cave. We were ready.

00:02:26.552 --> 00:02:29.992
So about that time, our little expedition
became quite a story,

00:02:29.992 --> 00:02:32.013
and it got picked up in The New York Times.

00:02:32.013 --> 00:02:33.825
And we were pretty much just overwhelmed

00:02:33.825 --> 00:02:35.608
with interest from people who wanted a kit

00:02:35.608 --> 00:02:38.129
that they could build this open ROV themselves.

00:02:38.129 --> 00:02:41.418
So we decided to put the project on Kickstarter,

00:02:41.418 --> 00:02:42.650
and when we did,

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:44.725
we raised our funding goal in about two hours,

00:02:44.725 --> 00:02:47.930
and all of a sudden, 
had this money to make these kits.

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:50.125
But then we had to learn how to make them.

00:02:50.125 --> 00:02:52.290
I mean, we had to learn small batch manufacturing.

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:55.550
So we quickly learned that our garage

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:58.229
was not big enough to hold our growing operation.

00:02:58.229 --> 00:03:00.385
But we were able to do it, we got all the kits made,

00:03:00.385 --> 00:03:03.092
thanks a lot to TechShop,
which was a big help to us,

00:03:03.092 --> 00:03:06.077
and we shipped these kits all over the world

00:03:06.077 --> 00:03:07.906
just before Christmas of last year,

00:03:07.906 --> 00:03:09.688
so it was just a few months ago.

00:03:09.688 --> 00:03:11.596
But we're already starting to get video

00:03:11.596 --> 00:03:13.194
and photos back from all over the world,

00:03:13.194 --> 00:03:16.224
including this shot from under the ice in Antarctica.

00:03:16.224 --> 00:03:19.624
We've also learned the penguins love robots.

00:03:19.624 --> 00:03:21.637
(Laughter)

00:03:21.637 --> 00:03:24.805
So we're still publishing all the designs online,

00:03:24.805 --> 00:03:26.923
encouraging anyone to build these themselves.

00:03:26.923 --> 00:03:29.326
That's the only way that we could have done this.

00:03:29.326 --> 00:03:30.985
By being open source, we've created

00:03:30.985 --> 00:03:33.249
this distributed R&amp;D network,

00:03:33.249 --> 00:03:37.045
and we're moving faster than
any venture-backed counterpart.

00:03:37.045 --> 00:03:40.250
But the actual robot is really only half the story.

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:42.746
The real potential, the long term potential,

00:03:42.746 --> 00:03:45.423
is with this community of DIY ocean explorers

00:03:45.423 --> 00:03:47.819
that are forming all over the globe.

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:49.353
What can we discover

00:03:49.353 --> 00:03:51.257
when there's thousands of these devices

00:03:51.257 --> 00:03:53.303
roaming the seas?

00:03:53.303 --> 00:03:55.579
So you're probably all wondering: the cave.

00:03:55.579 --> 00:03:57.405
Did you find the gold?

00:03:57.405 --> 00:03:58.957
Well, we didn't find any gold,

00:03:58.957 --> 00:04:02.186
but we decided that what we found
was much more valuable.

00:04:02.186 --> 00:04:04.658
It was the glimpse into a potential future

00:04:04.658 --> 00:04:06.333
for ocean exploration.

00:04:06.333 --> 00:04:09.243
It's something that's not limited to
the James Camerons of the world,

00:04:09.243 --> 00:04:11.838
but something that we're all participating in.

00:04:11.838 --> 00:04:13.171
It's an underwater world

00:04:13.171 --> 00:04:15.682
we're all exploring together.

00:04:15.682 --> 00:04:17.857
Thank you.

00:04:17.857 --> 00:04:21.857
(Applause)
