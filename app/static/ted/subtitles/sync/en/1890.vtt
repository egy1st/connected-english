WEBVTT

00:00:12.731 --> 00:00:16.439
I'm a man who's trying to live from his heart,

00:00:16.439 --> 00:00:19.504
and so just before I get going,

00:00:19.504 --> 00:00:22.075
I wanted to tell you as a South African

00:00:22.075 --> 00:00:25.059
that one of the men who has inspired me most

00:00:25.059 --> 00:00:28.125
passed away a few hours ago.

00:00:28.125 --> 00:00:30.815
Nelson Mandela has come to the end

00:00:30.815 --> 00:00:33.495
of his long walk to freedom.

00:00:33.495 --> 00:00:38.430
And so this talk is going to be for him.

00:00:40.694 --> 00:00:43.504
I grew up in wonder.

00:00:43.504 --> 00:00:47.619
I grew up amongst those animals.

00:00:47.619 --> 00:00:52.010
I grew up in the wild eastern part of South Africa

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:54.908
at a place called Londolozi Game Reserve.

00:00:54.908 --> 00:00:57.680
It's a place where my family has been

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:01.875
in the safari business for four generations.

00:01:01.875 --> 00:01:04.112
Now for as long as I can remember,

00:01:04.112 --> 00:01:08.849
my job has been to take people out into nature,

00:01:08.849 --> 00:01:11.760
and so I think it's a lovely twist of fate today

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.580
to have the opportunity

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:16.461
to bring some of my experiences out in nature

00:01:16.461 --> 00:01:18.601
in to this gathering.

00:01:18.601 --> 00:01:20.480
Africa is a place

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:23.864
where people still sit under starlit skies

00:01:23.864 --> 00:01:27.274
and around campfires and tell stories,

00:01:27.274 --> 00:01:29.965
and so what I have to share with you today

00:01:29.965 --> 00:01:34.384
is the simple medicine of a few campfire stories,

00:01:34.384 --> 00:01:37.522
stories about heroes of heart.

00:01:37.522 --> 00:01:39.642
Now my stories are not the stories

00:01:39.642 --> 00:01:41.340
that you'll hear on the news,

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.313
and while it's true that Africa is a harsh place,

00:01:44.313 --> 00:01:46.250
I also know it to be a place

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:50.516
where people, animals and ecosystems

00:01:50.516 --> 00:01:54.903
teach us about a more interconnected world.

00:01:54.903 --> 00:01:56.881
When I was nine years old,

00:01:56.881 --> 00:02:00.115
President Mandela came to stay with my family.

00:02:00.115 --> 00:02:03.539
He had just been released from
his 27 years of incarceration,

00:02:03.539 --> 00:02:06.166
and was in a period of readjustment

00:02:06.166 --> 00:02:08.825
to his sudden global icon status.

00:02:08.825 --> 00:02:11.325
Members of the African National Congress

00:02:11.325 --> 00:02:13.316
thought that in the bush

00:02:13.316 --> 00:02:15.550
he would have time to rest and recuperate

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:17.311
away from the public eye,

00:02:17.311 --> 00:02:20.690
and it's true that lions tend to be

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:24.921
a very good deterrent to press and paparazzi.

00:02:24.921 --> 00:02:27.050
(Laughter)

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:29.596
But it was a defining time for me as a young boy.

00:02:29.596 --> 00:02:31.657
I would take him breakfast in bed,

00:02:31.657 --> 00:02:34.025
and then, in an old track suit and slippers,

00:02:34.025 --> 00:02:36.630
he would go for a walk around the garden.

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:38.308
At night, I would sit with my family

00:02:38.308 --> 00:02:40.809
around the snowy, bunny-eared TV,

00:02:40.809 --> 00:02:43.227
and watch images of that same

00:02:43.227 --> 00:02:45.161
quiet man from the garden

00:02:45.161 --> 00:02:48.211
surrounded by hundreds and thousands of people

00:02:48.211 --> 00:02:51.470
as scenes from his release were broadcast nightly.

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:53.422
He was bringing peace

00:02:53.422 --> 00:02:56.304
to a divided and violent South Africa,

00:02:56.304 --> 00:03:01.533
one man with an unbelievable sense of his humanity.

00:03:01.533 --> 00:03:04.297
Mandela said often that the gift of prison

00:03:04.297 --> 00:03:07.257
was the ability to go within and to think,

00:03:07.257 --> 00:03:08.986
to create in himself

00:03:08.986 --> 00:03:11.865
the things he most wanted for South Africa:

00:03:11.865 --> 00:03:15.210
peace, reconciliation, harmony.

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:18.065
Through this act of immense open-heartedness,

00:03:18.065 --> 00:03:20.297
he was to become the embodiment

00:03:20.297 --> 00:03:23.836
of what in South Africa we call "ubuntu."

00:03:23.836 --> 00:03:26.685
Ubuntu: I am because of you.

00:03:26.685 --> 00:03:29.348
Or, people are not people

00:03:29.348 --> 00:03:32.073
without other people.

00:03:32.073 --> 00:03:33.919
It's not a new idea or value

00:03:33.919 --> 00:03:35.774
but it's one that I certainly think at these times

00:03:35.774 --> 00:03:37.523
is worth building on.

00:03:37.523 --> 00:03:40.687
In fact, it is said that in the
collective consciousness of Africa,

00:03:40.687 --> 00:03:42.726
we get to experience the deepest parts

00:03:42.726 --> 00:03:44.031
of our own humanity

00:03:44.031 --> 00:03:46.815
through our interactions with others.

00:03:46.815 --> 00:03:48.927
Ubuntu is at play right now.

00:03:48.927 --> 00:03:50.927
You are holding a space for me

00:03:50.927 --> 00:03:54.319
to express the deepest truth of who I am.

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:56.579
Without you, I'm just a guy talking to an empty room,

00:03:56.579 --> 00:03:59.657
and I spent a lot of time last week doing that,

00:03:59.657 --> 00:04:02.980
and it's not the same as this.

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:05.406
(Laughter)

00:04:05.406 --> 00:04:08.854
If Mandela was the national
and international embodiment,

00:04:08.854 --> 00:04:10.448
then the man who taught me the most

00:04:10.448 --> 00:04:13.051
about this value personally was this man,

00:04:13.051 --> 00:04:14.409
Solly Mhlongo.

00:04:14.409 --> 00:04:16.217
Solly was born under a tree

00:04:16.217 --> 00:04:19.003
60 kilometers from where I grew up in Mozambique.

00:04:19.003 --> 00:04:20.503
He would never have a lot of money,

00:04:20.503 --> 00:04:21.925
but he was to be

00:04:21.925 --> 00:04:24.554
one of the richest men I would ever meet.

00:04:24.554 --> 00:04:27.273
Solly grew up tending to his father's cattle.

00:04:27.273 --> 00:04:31.455
Now, I can tell you, I don't know what it is
about people who grow up looking after cattle,

00:04:31.455 --> 00:04:34.477
but it makes for Ã¼ber-resourcefulness.

00:04:34.477 --> 00:04:36.951
The first job that he ever got in the safari business

00:04:36.951 --> 00:04:39.167
was fixing the safari trucks.

00:04:39.167 --> 00:04:41.821
Where he had learned to do that out in the bush

00:04:41.821 --> 00:04:43.950
I have no idea, but he could do it.

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:45.877
He then moved across into what we called

00:04:45.877 --> 00:04:47.264
the habitat team.

00:04:47.264 --> 00:04:49.150
These were the people on the reserve

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:51.507
who were responsible for its well-being.

00:04:51.507 --> 00:04:53.791
He fixed roads, he mended wetlands,

00:04:53.791 --> 00:04:55.609
he did some anti-poaching.

00:04:55.609 --> 00:04:57.735
And then one day we were out together,

00:04:57.735 --> 00:05:01.266
and he came across the tracks of where
a female leopard had walked.

00:05:01.266 --> 00:05:03.040
And it was an old track,

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:05.481
but for fun he turned and he began to follow it,

00:05:05.481 --> 00:05:07.056
and I tell you, I could tell by the speed

00:05:07.056 --> 00:05:08.753
at which he moved on those pad marks

00:05:08.753 --> 00:05:12.727
that this man was a Ph.D.-level tracker.

00:05:12.727 --> 00:05:14.501
If you drove past Solly

00:05:14.501 --> 00:05:16.179
somewhere out on the reserve,

00:05:16.179 --> 00:05:17.828
you look up in your rearview mirror,

00:05:17.828 --> 00:05:19.673
you'd see he'd stopped the car

00:05:19.673 --> 00:05:21.719
20, 50 meters down the road

00:05:21.719 --> 00:05:24.732
just in case you need help with something.

00:05:24.732 --> 00:05:27.485
The only accusation I ever heard leveled at him

00:05:27.485 --> 00:05:28.880
was when one of our clients said,

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:32.097
"Solly, you are pathologically helpful."

00:05:32.097 --> 00:05:34.544
(Laughter)

00:05:34.544 --> 00:05:37.435
When I started professionally guiding people

00:05:37.435 --> 00:05:39.092
out into this environment,

00:05:39.092 --> 00:05:40.652
Solly was my tracker.

00:05:40.652 --> 00:05:42.471
We worked together as a team.

00:05:42.471 --> 00:05:44.497
And the first guests we ever got

00:05:44.497 --> 00:05:47.344
were a philanthropy group from your East Coast,

00:05:47.344 --> 00:05:49.698
and they said to Solly, on the side, they said,

00:05:49.698 --> 00:05:52.339
"Before we even go out to see lions and leopards,

00:05:52.339 --> 00:05:54.401
we want to see where you live."

00:05:54.401 --> 00:05:55.866
So we took them up to his house,

00:05:55.866 --> 00:05:58.738
and this visit of the philanthropist to his house

00:05:58.738 --> 00:06:01.419
coincided with a time when Solly's wife,

00:06:01.419 --> 00:06:03.019
who was learning English,

00:06:03.019 --> 00:06:05.203
was going through a phase
where she would open the door

00:06:05.203 --> 00:06:07.867
by saying, "Hello, I love you.

00:06:07.867 --> 00:06:10.082
Welcome, I love you." (Laughter)

00:06:10.082 --> 00:06:12.631
And there was something so beautifully African

00:06:12.631 --> 00:06:14.476
about it to me, this small house

00:06:14.476 --> 00:06:17.061
with a huge heart in it.

00:06:17.061 --> 00:06:23.636
Now on the day that Solly saved my life,

00:06:23.636 --> 00:06:25.647
he was already my hero.

00:06:25.647 --> 00:06:27.228
It was a hot day,

00:06:27.228 --> 00:06:29.202
and we found ourselves down by the river.

00:06:29.202 --> 00:06:32.038
Because of the heat, I took my shoes off,

00:06:32.038 --> 00:06:33.741
and I rolled up my pants,

00:06:33.741 --> 00:06:35.982
and I walked into the water.

00:06:35.982 --> 00:06:37.544
Solly remained on the bank.

00:06:37.544 --> 00:06:40.567
The water was clear running over sand,

00:06:40.567 --> 00:06:43.881
and we turned and we began
to make our way upstream.

00:06:43.881 --> 00:06:45.701
And a few meters ahead of us,

00:06:45.701 --> 00:06:48.686
there was a place where a tree
had fallen out of the bank,

00:06:48.686 --> 00:06:51.457
and its branches were touching the water,

00:06:51.457 --> 00:06:53.054
and it was shadowy.

00:06:53.054 --> 00:06:55.512
And if had been a horror movie,

00:06:55.512 --> 00:06:57.748
people in the audience would have started saying,

00:06:57.748 --> 00:07:01.201
"Don't go in there. Don't go in there." (Laughter)

00:07:01.201 --> 00:07:04.958
And of course, the crocodile was in the shadows.

00:07:04.958 --> 00:07:07.073
Now the first thing that you notice
when a crocodile hits you

00:07:07.073 --> 00:07:08.673
is the ferocity of the bite.

00:07:08.673 --> 00:07:10.646
Wham! It hits me by my right leg.

00:07:10.646 --> 00:07:14.549
It pulls me. It turns. I throw my hand up.
I'm able to grab a branch.

00:07:14.549 --> 00:07:16.287
It's shaking me violently.

00:07:16.287 --> 00:07:18.001
It's a very strange sensation

00:07:18.001 --> 00:07:19.947
having another creature try and eat you,

00:07:19.947 --> 00:07:23.398
and there are few things that
promote vegetarianism like that.

00:07:23.398 --> 00:07:24.993
(Laughter)

00:07:24.993 --> 00:07:27.278
Solly on the bank sees that I'm in trouble.

00:07:27.278 --> 00:07:29.325
He turns. He begins to make his way to me.

00:07:29.325 --> 00:07:31.276
The croc again continues to shake me.

00:07:31.276 --> 00:07:33.193
It goes to bite me a second time.

00:07:33.193 --> 00:07:35.382
I notice a slick of blood in the water around me

00:07:35.382 --> 00:07:36.986
that gets washed downstream.

00:07:36.986 --> 00:07:39.159
As it bites the second time, I kick.

00:07:39.159 --> 00:07:41.892
My foot goes down its throat. It spits me out.

00:07:41.892 --> 00:07:44.023
I pull myself up into the branches,

00:07:44.023 --> 00:07:47.506
and as I come out of the water,
I look over my shoulder.

00:07:47.506 --> 00:07:49.426
My leg from the knee down

00:07:49.426 --> 00:07:51.354
is mangled beyond description.

00:07:51.354 --> 00:07:52.749
The bone is cracked.

00:07:52.749 --> 00:07:54.579
The meat is torn up.

00:07:54.579 --> 00:07:59.179
I make an instant decision that
I'll never look at that again.

00:07:59.179 --> 00:08:01.563
As I come out of the water,

00:08:01.563 --> 00:08:04.180
Solly arrives at a deep section,

00:08:04.180 --> 00:08:05.805
a channel between us.

00:08:05.805 --> 00:08:07.943
He knows, he sees the state of my leg,

00:08:07.943 --> 00:08:09.789
he knows that between him and I

00:08:09.789 --> 00:08:11.001
there is a crocodile,

00:08:11.001 --> 00:08:13.493
and I can tell you this man doesn't
slow down for one second.

00:08:13.493 --> 00:08:15.299
He comes straight into the channel.

00:08:15.299 --> 00:08:17.234
He wades in to above his waist.

00:08:17.234 --> 00:08:18.697
He gets to me. He grabs me.

00:08:18.697 --> 00:08:20.369
I'm still in a vulnerable position.

00:08:20.369 --> 00:08:22.094
He picks me and puts me on his shoulder.

00:08:22.094 --> 00:08:24.513
This is the other thing about Solly,
he's freakishly strong.

00:08:24.513 --> 00:08:26.976
He turns. He walks me up the bank.

00:08:26.976 --> 00:08:29.030
He lays me down. He pulls his shirt off.

00:08:29.030 --> 00:08:30.814
He wraps it around my leg,

00:08:30.814 --> 00:08:32.105
picks me up a second time,

00:08:32.105 --> 00:08:34.011
walks me to a vehicle,

00:08:34.011 --> 00:08:37.435
and he's able to get me to medical attention.

00:08:37.435 --> 00:08:40.658
And I survive.

00:08:40.658 --> 00:08:44.919
Now â (Applause)

00:08:44.919 --> 00:08:47.629
Now I don't know how many people you know

00:08:47.629 --> 00:08:49.845
that go into a deep channel of water

00:08:49.845 --> 00:08:52.105
that they know has a crocodile in it

00:08:52.105 --> 00:08:53.448
to come and help you,

00:08:53.448 --> 00:08:56.892
but for Solly, it was as natural as breathing.

00:08:56.892 --> 00:08:59.348
And he is one amazing example

00:08:59.348 --> 00:09:02.793
of what I have experienced all over Africa.

00:09:02.793 --> 00:09:04.924
In a more collective society,

00:09:04.924 --> 00:09:07.772
we realize from the inside

00:09:07.772 --> 00:09:10.905
that our own well-being is deeply tied

00:09:10.905 --> 00:09:14.143
to the well-being of others.

00:09:14.143 --> 00:09:17.412
Danger is shared. Pain is shared.

00:09:17.412 --> 00:09:20.337
Joy is shared. Achievement is shared.

00:09:20.337 --> 00:09:24.867
Houses are shared. Food is shared.

00:09:24.867 --> 00:09:28.063
Ubuntu asks us to open our hearts

00:09:28.063 --> 00:09:29.477
and to share,

00:09:29.477 --> 00:09:31.429
and what Solly taught me that day

00:09:31.429 --> 00:09:33.432
is the essence of this value,

00:09:33.432 --> 00:09:36.190
his animated, empathetic action

00:09:36.190 --> 00:09:38.235
in every moment.

00:09:38.235 --> 00:09:41.742
Now although the root word is about people,

00:09:41.742 --> 00:09:45.116
I thought that maybe ubuntu was only about people.

00:09:45.116 --> 00:09:48.390
And then I met this young lady.

00:09:48.390 --> 00:09:50.084
Her name was Elvis.

00:09:50.084 --> 00:09:51.855
In fact, Solly gave her the name Elvis

00:09:51.855 --> 00:09:54.712
because he said she walked like she was doing

00:09:54.712 --> 00:09:57.377
the Elvis the pelvis dance.

00:09:57.377 --> 00:10:01.743
She was born with very badly
deformed back legs and pelvis.

00:10:01.743 --> 00:10:04.007
She arrived at our reserve from a reserve

00:10:04.007 --> 00:10:06.063
east of us on her migratory route.

00:10:06.063 --> 00:10:07.842
When I first saw her,

00:10:07.842 --> 00:10:10.310
I thought she would be dead in a matter of days.

00:10:10.310 --> 00:10:13.238
And yet, for the next five years

00:10:13.238 --> 00:10:15.768
she returned in the winter months.

00:10:15.768 --> 00:10:18.145
And we would be so excited to be out in the bush

00:10:18.145 --> 00:10:20.541
and to come across this unusual track.

00:10:20.541 --> 00:10:22.036
It looked like an inverted bracket,

00:10:22.036 --> 00:10:24.485
and we would drop whatever
we were doing and we would follow,

00:10:24.485 --> 00:10:26.156
and then we would come around the corner,

00:10:26.156 --> 00:10:28.242
and there she would be with her herd.

00:10:28.242 --> 00:10:31.137
And that outpouring of emotion

00:10:31.137 --> 00:10:32.851
from people on our safari trucks

00:10:32.851 --> 00:10:36.093
as they saw her, it was this sense of kinship.

00:10:36.093 --> 00:10:37.578
And it reminded me

00:10:37.578 --> 00:10:39.509
that even people who grow up in cities

00:10:39.509 --> 00:10:43.094
feel a natural connection

00:10:43.094 --> 00:10:45.365
with the natural world and with animals.

00:10:45.365 --> 00:10:48.949
And yet still I remained amazed
that she was surviving.

00:10:48.949 --> 00:10:51.910
And then one day we came across
them at this small water hole.

00:10:51.910 --> 00:10:53.762
It was sort of a hollow in the ground.

00:10:53.762 --> 00:10:56.216
And I watched as the matriarch drank,

00:10:56.216 --> 00:10:59.490
and then she turned in that 
beautiful slow motion of elephants,

00:10:59.491 --> 00:11:01.260
looks like the arm in motion,

00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:04.266
and she began to make her way up the steep bank.

00:11:04.266 --> 00:11:08.910
The rest of the herd turned and began to follow.

00:11:08.910 --> 00:11:10.694
And I watched young Elvis

00:11:10.694 --> 00:11:14.050
begin to psych herself up for the hill.

00:11:14.050 --> 00:11:17.405
She got visibly -- ears came forward,

00:11:17.405 --> 00:11:19.554
she had a full go of it and halfway up,

00:11:19.554 --> 00:11:21.831
her legs gave way, and she fell backwards.

00:11:21.831 --> 00:11:23.650
She attempted it a second time,

00:11:23.650 --> 00:11:26.825
and again, halfway up, she fell backwards.

00:11:26.825 --> 00:11:28.682
And on the third attempt,

00:11:28.682 --> 00:11:31.139
an amazing thing happened.

00:11:31.139 --> 00:11:32.876
Halfway up the bank,

00:11:32.876 --> 00:11:35.949
a young teenage elephant came in behind her,

00:11:35.949 --> 00:11:38.152
and he propped his trunk underneath her,

00:11:38.152 --> 00:11:41.489
and he began to shovel her up the bank.

00:11:41.489 --> 00:11:42.877
And it occurred to me

00:11:42.877 --> 00:11:44.433
that the rest of the herd

00:11:44.433 --> 00:11:47.108
was in fact looking after this young elephant.

00:11:47.108 --> 00:11:49.632
The next day I watched again

00:11:49.632 --> 00:11:51.802
as the matriarch broke a branch

00:11:51.802 --> 00:11:53.643
and she would put it in her mouth,

00:11:53.643 --> 00:11:55.600
and then she would break a second one

00:11:55.600 --> 00:11:58.307
and drop it on the ground.

00:11:58.307 --> 00:12:00.679
And a consensus developed between all of us

00:12:00.679 --> 00:12:02.528
who were guiding people in that area

00:12:02.528 --> 00:12:05.677
that that herd was in fact moving slower

00:12:05.677 --> 00:12:09.733
to accommodate that elephant.

00:12:09.733 --> 00:12:11.824
What Elvis and the herd taught me

00:12:11.824 --> 00:12:15.148
caused me to expand my definition of ubuntu,

00:12:15.148 --> 00:12:17.764
and I believe that in the cathedral of the wild,

00:12:17.764 --> 00:12:19.975
we get to see the most beautiful parts of ourselves

00:12:19.975 --> 00:12:21.732
reflected back at us.

00:12:21.732 --> 00:12:25.372
And it is not only through other people

00:12:25.372 --> 00:12:28.292
that we get to experience our humanity

00:12:28.292 --> 00:12:32.218
but through all the creatures that live on this planet.

00:12:32.218 --> 00:12:35.032
If Africa has a gift to share,

00:12:35.032 --> 00:12:38.859
it's a gift of a more collective society.

00:12:38.859 --> 00:12:43.107
And while it's true that ubuntu is an African idea,

00:12:43.107 --> 00:12:47.518
what I see is the essence of that value

00:12:47.518 --> 00:12:49.880
being invented here.

00:12:49.880 --> 00:12:51.995
Thank you.

00:12:51.995 --> 00:12:56.848
(Applause)

00:13:16.232 --> 00:13:18.029
Pat Mitchell: So Boyd,

00:13:18.029 --> 00:13:23.070
we know that you knew President Mandela

00:13:23.070 --> 00:13:25.047
from early childhood

00:13:25.047 --> 00:13:27.946
and that you heard the news as we all did today,

00:13:27.946 --> 00:13:30.386
and deeply distraught

00:13:30.386 --> 00:13:34.817
and know the tragic loss that it is to the world.

00:13:34.817 --> 00:13:36.899
But I just wondered if you wanted

00:13:36.899 --> 00:13:38.790
to share any additional thoughts,

00:13:38.805 --> 00:13:40.879
because we know that you heard that news

00:13:40.879 --> 00:13:44.259
just before coming in to do this session.

00:13:44.259 --> 00:13:45.955
Boyd Varty: Well thanks, Pat.

00:13:45.955 --> 00:13:49.138
I'm so happy because it was time for him to pass on.

00:13:49.138 --> 00:13:50.909
He was suffering.

00:13:50.909 --> 00:13:53.307
And so of course there's the mixed emotions.

00:13:53.307 --> 00:13:55.291
But I just think of so many occurrences

00:13:55.291 --> 00:13:57.698
like the time he went on the Oprah show

00:13:57.698 --> 00:14:00.554
and asked her what the show would be about.

00:14:00.554 --> 00:14:02.032
(Laughter)

00:14:02.032 --> 00:14:05.330
And she was like, "Well, it'll be about you."

00:14:05.330 --> 00:14:08.078
I mean, that's just incredible humility.

00:14:08.078 --> 00:14:11.741
(Laughter)

00:14:11.741 --> 00:14:14.903
He was the father of our nation

00:14:14.903 --> 00:14:21.351
and we've got a road to walk in South Africa.

00:14:21.351 --> 00:14:24.761
And everything, they used to call it Madiba magic.

00:14:24.761 --> 00:14:27.544
You know, he used to go to
a rugby match and we would win.

00:14:27.544 --> 00:14:31.005
Anywhere he went, things went well.

00:14:31.005 --> 00:14:33.386
But I think that magic will be with us,

00:14:33.386 --> 00:14:36.947
and the important thing is that we carry

00:14:36.947 --> 00:14:38.472
what he stood for.

00:14:38.472 --> 00:14:41.959
And so that's what I'm going to try and do,

00:14:41.959 --> 00:14:44.851
and that's what people all over 
South Africa are trying to do.

00:14:44.851 --> 00:14:47.077
PM: And that's what you've done today.
BV: Oh, thank you.

00:14:47.077 --> 00:14:50.216
PM: Thank you.
BV: Thank you. Thanks very much.

00:14:50.216 --> 00:14:54.438
(Applause)
