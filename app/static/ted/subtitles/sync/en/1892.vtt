00:00:12.694 --> 00:00:15.721
By 2010, Detroit had become the poster child

00:00:15.721 --> 00:00:17.862
for an American city in crisis.

00:00:17.862 --> 00:00:19.734
There was a housing collapse,

00:00:19.734 --> 00:00:21.692
an auto industry collapse,

00:00:21.692 --> 00:00:24.244
and the population had plummeted by 25 percent

00:00:24.244 --> 00:00:26.666
between 2000 and 2010,

00:00:26.666 --> 00:00:28.883
and many people were beginning to write it off,

00:00:28.883 --> 00:00:32.609
as it had topped the list of American shrinking cities.

00:00:32.609 --> 00:00:34.996
By 2010, I had also been asked by

00:00:34.996 --> 00:00:37.196
the Kresge Foundation and the city of Detroit

00:00:37.196 --> 00:00:40.450
to join them in leading a citywide planning process

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:43.924
for the city to create a shared vision for its future.

00:00:43.924 --> 00:00:45.395
I come to this work

00:00:45.395 --> 00:00:47.212
as an architect and an urban planner,

00:00:47.212 --> 00:00:49.818
and I've spent my career working
in other contested cities,

00:00:49.818 --> 00:00:51.674
like Chicago, my hometown;

00:00:51.674 --> 00:00:53.680
Harlem, which is my current home;

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:56.706
Washington, D.C.; and Newark, New Jersey.

00:00:56.706 --> 00:00:59.086
All of these cities, to me, still had a number

00:00:59.086 --> 00:01:01.922
of unresolved issues related to urban justice,

00:01:01.922 --> 00:01:06.274
issues of equity, inclusion and access.

00:01:06.274 --> 00:01:08.337
Now by 2010, as well,

00:01:08.337 --> 00:01:10.352
popular design magazines were also beginning

00:01:10.352 --> 00:01:13.065
to take a closer look at cities like Detroit,

00:01:13.065 --> 00:01:16.702
and devoting whole issues to "fixing the city."

00:01:16.702 --> 00:01:19.078
I was asked by a good friend, Fred Bernstein,

00:01:19.078 --> 00:01:21.053
to do an interview for the October issue

00:01:21.053 --> 00:01:22.704
of Architect magazine,

00:01:22.704 --> 00:01:24.359
and he and I kind of had a good chuckle

00:01:24.359 --> 00:01:27.575
when we saw the magazine released with the title,

00:01:27.575 --> 00:01:30.461
"Can This Planner Save Detroit?"

00:01:30.461 --> 00:01:33.336
So I'm smiling with a little bit
of embarrassment right now,

00:01:33.336 --> 00:01:35.743
because obviously, it's completely absurd

00:01:35.743 --> 00:01:37.715
that a single person, let alone a planner,

00:01:37.715 --> 00:01:39.173
could save a city.

00:01:39.173 --> 00:01:41.674
But I'm also smiling because I thought it represented

00:01:41.674 --> 00:01:44.308
a sense of hopefulness that our profession

00:01:44.308 --> 00:01:47.226
could play a role in helping the city to think about

00:01:47.226 --> 00:01:51.290
how it would recover from its severe crisis.

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:53.562
So I'd like to spend a little bit of time this afternoon

00:01:53.562 --> 00:01:55.243
and tell you a little bit about our process

00:01:55.243 --> 00:01:57.919
for fixing the city, a little bit about Detroit,

00:01:57.919 --> 00:02:01.033
and I want to do that through
the voices of Detroiters.

00:02:01.033 --> 00:02:04.101
So we began our process in September of 2010.

00:02:04.101 --> 00:02:07.030
It's just after a special mayoral election,

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:09.071
and word has gotten out that there is going to be

00:02:09.071 --> 00:02:10.615
this citywide planning process,

00:02:10.615 --> 00:02:12.964
which brings a lot of anxiety and fears

00:02:12.964 --> 00:02:14.747
among Detroiters.

00:02:14.752 --> 00:02:18.992
We had planned to hold a number
of community meetings in rooms like this

00:02:18.992 --> 00:02:21.376
to introduce the planning process,

00:02:21.376 --> 00:02:23.372
and people came out from all over the city,

00:02:23.372 --> 00:02:26.223
including areas that were stable neighborhoods,

00:02:26.223 --> 00:02:27.999
as well as areas that were beginning to see

00:02:27.999 --> 00:02:29.993
a lot of vacancy.

00:02:29.993 --> 00:02:32.091
And most of our audience was representative

00:02:32.091 --> 00:02:34.644
of the 82 percent African-American population

00:02:34.644 --> 00:02:36.909
in the city at that time.

00:02:36.909 --> 00:02:40.397
So obviously, we have a Q&amp;A portion of our program,

00:02:40.397 --> 00:02:43.294
and people line up to mics to ask questions.

00:02:43.294 --> 00:02:46.053
Many of them step very firmly to the mic,

00:02:46.053 --> 00:02:48.901
put their hands across their chest, and go,

00:02:48.901 --> 00:02:52.380
"I know you people are trying to
move me out of my house, right?"

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:54.699
So that question is really powerful,

00:02:54.699 --> 00:02:57.912
and it was certainly powerful to us in the moment,

00:02:57.912 --> 00:03:00.021
when you connect it to the stories

00:03:00.021 --> 00:03:01.408
that some Detroiters had,

00:03:01.408 --> 00:03:03.614
and actually a lot of African-Americans'

00:03:03.614 --> 00:03:05.071
families have had

00:03:05.071 --> 00:03:08.802
that are living in Midwestern cities like Detroit.

00:03:08.802 --> 00:03:11.137
Many of them told us the stories about

00:03:11.137 --> 00:03:12.597
how they came to own their home

00:03:12.597 --> 00:03:14.761
through their grandparents or great-grandparents,

00:03:14.761 --> 00:03:17.635
who were one of 1.6 million people who migrated

00:03:17.635 --> 00:03:20.328
from the rural South to the industrial North,

00:03:20.328 --> 00:03:22.676
as depicted in this painting by Jacob Lawrence,

00:03:22.676 --> 00:03:24.302
"The Great Migration."

00:03:24.302 --> 00:03:27.545
They came to Detroit for a better way of life.

00:03:27.545 --> 00:03:30.149
Many found work in the automobile industry,

00:03:30.149 --> 00:03:32.550
the Ford Motor Company, as depicted in this mural

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:36.605
by Diego Rivera in the Detroit Institute of Art.

00:03:36.605 --> 00:03:39.580
The fruits of their labors would afford them a home,

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:42.461
for many the first piece of property
that they would ever know,

00:03:42.461 --> 00:03:44.324
and a community with other first-time

00:03:44.324 --> 00:03:46.453
African-American home buyers.

00:03:46.453 --> 00:03:48.833
The first couple of decades of their life in the North

00:03:48.833 --> 00:03:51.877
is quite well, up until about 1950,

00:03:51.877 --> 00:03:54.485
which coincides with the city's peak population

00:03:54.485 --> 00:03:56.792
at 1.8 million people.

00:03:56.792 --> 00:03:59.170
Now it's at this time that Detroit begins to see

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:01.388
a second kind of migration,

00:04:01.388 --> 00:04:03.721
a migration to the suburbs.

00:04:03.721 --> 00:04:06.558
Between 1950 and 2000,

00:04:06.558 --> 00:04:09.493
the region grows by 30 percent.

00:04:09.493 --> 00:04:11.392
But this time, the migration leaves

00:04:11.392 --> 00:04:13.497
African-Americans in place,

00:04:13.497 --> 00:04:16.443
as families and businesses flee the city,

00:04:16.443 --> 00:04:18.805
leaving the city pretty desolate of people

00:04:18.805 --> 00:04:20.559
as well as jobs.

00:04:20.559 --> 00:04:25.359
During that same period, between
1950 and 2000, 2010,

00:04:25.359 --> 00:04:28.224
the city loses 60 percent of its population,

00:04:28.224 --> 00:04:32.148
and today it hovers at above 700,000.

00:04:32.148 --> 00:04:34.634
The audience members who come
and talk to us that night

00:04:34.634 --> 00:04:37.419
tell us the stories of what it's like to live in a city

00:04:37.419 --> 00:04:40.136
with such depleted population.

00:04:40.136 --> 00:04:42.486
Many tell us that they're one of only a few homes

00:04:42.486 --> 00:04:45.029
on their block that are occupied,

00:04:45.029 --> 00:04:47.636
and that they can see several abandoned homes

00:04:47.636 --> 00:04:49.883
from where they sit on their porches.

00:04:49.883 --> 00:04:54.222
Citywide, there are 80,000 vacant homes.

00:04:54.222 --> 00:04:57.237
They can also see vacant property.

00:04:57.237 --> 00:04:59.094
They're beginning to see illegal activities

00:04:59.094 --> 00:05:01.318
on these properties, like illegal dumping,

00:05:01.318 --> 00:05:05.623
and they know that because the city
has lost so much population,

00:05:05.623 --> 00:05:10.790
their costs for water, electricity, gas are rising,

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:13.622
because there are not enough people
to pay property taxes

00:05:13.632 --> 00:05:16.966
to help support the services that they need.

00:05:16.966 --> 00:05:21.219
Citywide, there are about 100,000 vacant parcels.

00:05:21.223 --> 00:05:23.217
Now, to quickly give you all a sense of a scale,

00:05:23.217 --> 00:05:24.567
because I know that sounds like a big number,

00:05:24.567 --> 00:05:27.105
but I don't think you quite understand
until you look at the city map.

00:05:27.105 --> 00:05:29.811
So the city is 139 square miles.

00:05:29.811 --> 00:05:31.857
You can fit Boston, San Francisco,

00:05:31.857 --> 00:05:33.417
and the island of Manhattan

00:05:33.417 --> 00:05:35.093
within its footprint.

00:05:35.093 --> 00:05:37.483
So if we take all of that vacant
and abandoned property

00:05:37.483 --> 00:05:39.679
and we smush it together,

00:05:39.679 --> 00:05:41.515
it looks like about 20 square miles,

00:05:41.515 --> 00:05:43.483
and that's roughly equivalent to the size

00:05:43.483 --> 00:05:45.190
of the island we're sitting on today, Manhattan,

00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:46.640
at 22 square miles.

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:50.240
So it's a lot of vacancy.

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:52.416
Now some of our audience members

00:05:52.416 --> 00:05:54.534
also tell us about some of the positive things

00:05:54.534 --> 00:05:56.579
that are happening in their communities,

00:05:56.579 --> 00:05:58.166
and many of them are banding together

00:05:58.166 --> 00:06:00.272
to take control of some of the vacant lots,

00:06:00.272 --> 00:06:02.141
and they're starting community gardens,

00:06:02.141 --> 00:06:04.816
which are creating a great sense
of community stewardship,

00:06:04.816 --> 00:06:06.811
but they're very, very clear to tell us

00:06:06.811 --> 00:06:08.602
that this is not enough,

00:06:08.602 --> 00:06:10.108
that they want to see their neighborhoods

00:06:10.108 --> 00:06:13.461
return to the way that their
grandparents had found them.

00:06:13.461 --> 00:06:15.904
Now there's been a lot of speculation since 2010

00:06:15.904 --> 00:06:18.580
about what to do with the vacant property,

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:21.300
and a lot of that speculation has
been around community gardening,

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:23.532
or what we call urban agriculture.

00:06:23.532 --> 00:06:25.110
So many people would say to us,

00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:27.818
"What if you just take all that vacant land
and you could make it farmland?

00:06:27.818 --> 00:06:29.921
It can provide fresh foods,

00:06:29.921 --> 00:06:32.626
and it can put Detroiters back to work too."

00:06:32.626 --> 00:06:34.071
When I hear that story,

00:06:34.071 --> 00:06:36.687
I always imagine the folks from the Great Migration

00:06:36.687 --> 00:06:38.941
rolling over in their graves,

00:06:38.941 --> 00:06:42.258
because you can imagine that they didn't sacrifice

00:06:42.258 --> 00:06:44.335
moving from the South to the North

00:06:44.335 --> 00:06:46.447
to create a better life for their families,

00:06:46.447 --> 00:06:50.693
only to see their great-grandchildren
return to an agrarian lifestyle,

00:06:50.693 --> 00:06:52.901
especially in a city where they came

00:06:52.901 --> 00:06:54.955
with little less than a high school education

00:06:54.955 --> 00:06:56.922
or even a grammar school education

00:06:56.922 --> 00:06:58.947
and were able to afford the basic elements

00:06:58.947 --> 00:07:00.236
of the American dream:

00:07:00.236 --> 00:07:04.271
steady work and a home that they owned.

00:07:04.271 --> 00:07:06.502
Now, there's a third wave of migration

00:07:06.502 --> 00:07:08.062
happening in Detroit:

00:07:08.062 --> 00:07:11.206
a new ascendant of cultural entrepreneurs.

00:07:11.206 --> 00:07:13.622
These folks see that same vacant land

00:07:13.622 --> 00:07:15.117
and those same abandoned homes

00:07:15.117 --> 00:07:16.512
as opportunity for new,

00:07:16.512 --> 00:07:19.183
entrepreneurial ideas and profit,

00:07:19.183 --> 00:07:21.170
so much so that former models

00:07:21.170 --> 00:07:22.591
can move to Detroit,

00:07:22.591 --> 00:07:24.912
buy property, start successful

00:07:24.912 --> 00:07:26.589
businesses and restaurants,

00:07:26.589 --> 00:07:29.569
and become successful community
activists in their neighborhood,

00:07:29.569 --> 00:07:32.591
bringing about very positive change.

00:07:32.591 --> 00:07:35.495
Similarly, we have small manufacturing companies

00:07:35.495 --> 00:07:38.764
making conscious decisions to relocate to the city.

00:07:38.764 --> 00:07:41.549
This company, Shinola, which is a luxury watch

00:07:41.549 --> 00:07:43.261
and bicycle company,

00:07:43.261 --> 00:07:45.154
deliberately chose to relocate to Detroit,

00:07:45.154 --> 00:07:47.791
and they quote themselves by saying

00:07:47.791 --> 00:07:52.049
they were drawn to the global brand 
of Detroit's innovation.

00:07:52.049 --> 00:07:54.621
And they also knew that 
they can tap into a workforce

00:07:54.621 --> 00:07:58.147
that was still very skilled in how to make things.

00:07:58.147 --> 00:08:00.716
Now we have community stewardship

00:08:00.716 --> 00:08:02.276
happening in neighborhoods,

00:08:02.276 --> 00:08:05.075
we have cultural entrepreneurs making decisions

00:08:05.075 --> 00:08:08.123
to move to the city and create enterprises,

00:08:08.123 --> 00:08:09.858
and we have businesses relocating,

00:08:09.858 --> 00:08:11.244
and this is all in the context

00:08:11.244 --> 00:08:13.516
of what is no secret to us all,

00:08:13.516 --> 00:08:15.317
a city that's under the control

00:08:15.317 --> 00:08:16.939
of an emergency manager,

00:08:16.939 --> 00:08:21.213
and just this July filed for Chapter 9 bankruptcy.

00:08:21.213 --> 00:08:24.455
So 2010, we started this process, and by 2013,

00:08:24.455 --> 00:08:26.539
we released Detroit Future City,

00:08:26.539 --> 00:08:29.377
which was our strategic plan to guide the city

00:08:29.377 --> 00:08:31.196
into a better and more prosperous

00:08:31.196 --> 00:08:33.473
and more sustainable existence --

00:08:33.473 --> 00:08:37.138
not what it was, but what it could be,

00:08:37.138 --> 00:08:40.453
looking at new ways of economic growth,

00:08:40.453 --> 00:08:42.434
new forms of land use,

00:08:42.434 --> 00:08:45.542
more sustainable and denser neighborhoods,

00:08:45.542 --> 00:08:48.958
a reconfigured infrastructure
and city service system,

00:08:48.958 --> 00:08:51.826
and a heightened capacity for civic leaders

00:08:51.826 --> 00:08:55.088
to take action and implement change.

00:08:55.088 --> 00:08:57.686
Three key imperatives were really important

00:08:57.686 --> 00:08:58.967
to our work.

00:08:58.967 --> 00:09:02.845
One was that the city itself
wasn't necessarily too large,

00:09:02.845 --> 00:09:04.533
but the economy was too small.

00:09:04.533 --> 00:09:07.793
There are only 27 jobs per 100 people in Detroit,

00:09:07.793 --> 00:09:11.191
very different from a Denver
or an Atlanta or a Philadelphia

00:09:11.191 --> 00:09:16.111
that are anywhere between 
35 to 70 jobs per 100 people.

00:09:16.111 --> 00:09:18.533
Secondly, there had to be an acceptance

00:09:18.533 --> 00:09:20.489
that we were not going to be able to use

00:09:20.489 --> 00:09:23.353
all of this vacant land in the way that we had before

00:09:23.353 --> 00:09:25.362
and maybe for some time to come.

00:09:25.362 --> 00:09:27.927
It wasn't going to be our traditional
residential neighborhoods

00:09:27.927 --> 00:09:29.544
as we had before,

00:09:29.544 --> 00:09:32.302
and urban agriculture, while a very productive

00:09:32.302 --> 00:09:34.994
and successful intervention happening in Detroit,

00:09:34.994 --> 00:09:37.097
was not the only answer,

00:09:37.097 --> 00:09:39.533
that what we had to do is look at these areas

00:09:39.533 --> 00:09:41.341
where we had significant vacancy

00:09:41.341 --> 00:09:44.576
but still had a significant number of population

00:09:44.576 --> 00:09:47.474
of what could be new, productive, innovative,

00:09:47.474 --> 00:09:49.008
and entrepreneurial uses

00:09:49.008 --> 00:09:50.963
that could stabilize those communities,

00:09:50.963 --> 00:09:54.331
where still nearly 300,000 residents lived.

00:09:54.331 --> 00:09:57.147
So we came up with one neighborhood typology --

00:09:57.147 --> 00:10:00.120
there are several --
called a live-make neighborhood,

00:10:00.120 --> 00:10:02.079
where folks could reappropriate

00:10:02.079 --> 00:10:03.817
abandoned structures

00:10:03.817 --> 00:10:06.107
and turn them into entrepreneurial enterprises,

00:10:06.107 --> 00:10:09.190
with a specific emphasis on looking at the, again,

00:10:09.190 --> 00:10:12.375
majority 82 percent African-American population.

00:10:12.375 --> 00:10:14.476
So they, too, could take businesses

00:10:14.476 --> 00:10:16.875
that they maybe were doing out of their home

00:10:16.875 --> 00:10:19.586
and grow them to more prosperous industries

00:10:19.586 --> 00:10:22.296
and actually acquire property so they were actually

00:10:22.296 --> 00:10:24.745
property owners as well as business owners

00:10:24.745 --> 00:10:27.271
in the communities with which they resided.

00:10:27.271 --> 00:10:29.349
Then we also wanted to look at other ways

00:10:29.349 --> 00:10:32.683
of using land in addition to growing food

00:10:32.683 --> 00:10:34.507
and transforming landscape into

00:10:34.507 --> 00:10:36.367
much more productive uses,

00:10:36.367 --> 00:10:39.657
so that it could be used for storm
water management, for example,

00:10:39.657 --> 00:10:42.673
by using surface lakes and retention ponds,

00:10:42.673 --> 00:10:44.433
that created neighborhood amenities,

00:10:44.433 --> 00:10:46.125
places of recreation,

00:10:46.125 --> 00:10:47.942
and actually helped to elevate

00:10:47.942 --> 00:10:49.629
adjacent property levels.

00:10:49.629 --> 00:10:51.489
Or we could use it as research plots,

00:10:51.489 --> 00:10:54.797
where we can use it to remediate contaminated soils,

00:10:54.797 --> 00:10:58.763
or we could use it to generate energy.

00:10:58.763 --> 00:11:01.961
So the descendants of the Great Migration

00:11:01.961 --> 00:11:05.205
could either become precision
watchmakers at Shinola,

00:11:05.205 --> 00:11:08.516
like Willie H., who was featured
in one of their ads last year,

00:11:08.516 --> 00:11:10.908
or they can actually grow a business

00:11:10.908 --> 00:11:13.633
that would service companies like Shinola.

00:11:13.633 --> 00:11:15.635
The good news is, there is a future

00:11:15.635 --> 00:11:18.194
for the next generation of Detroiters,

00:11:18.194 --> 00:11:21.358
both those there now and those that want to come.

00:11:21.358 --> 00:11:23.489
So no thank you, Mayor Menino,

00:11:23.489 --> 00:11:25.132
who recently was quoted as saying,

00:11:25.132 --> 00:11:27.747
"I'd blow up the place and start over."

00:11:27.747 --> 00:11:30.098
There are very important people,

00:11:30.098 --> 00:11:32.499
business and land assets in Detroit,

00:11:32.499 --> 00:11:34.295
and there are real opportunities there.

00:11:34.295 --> 00:11:36.918
So while Detroit might not be what it was,

00:11:36.918 --> 00:11:38.537
Detroit will not die.

00:11:38.537 --> 00:11:40.560
Thank you.

00:11:40.560 --> 00:11:43.988
(Applause)
