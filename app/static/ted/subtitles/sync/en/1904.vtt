00:00:12.642 --> 00:00:16.074
The entire model of capitalism

00:00:16.074 --> 00:00:18.253
and the economic model that you and I

00:00:18.253 --> 00:00:19.932
did business in,

00:00:19.932 --> 00:00:21.759
and, in fact, continue to do business in,

00:00:21.759 --> 00:00:25.382
was built around what probably Milton Friedman

00:00:25.382 --> 00:00:27.100
put more succinctly.

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:29.680
And Adam Smith, of course, 
the father of modern economics

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:32.029
actually said many, many years ago,

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:33.547
the invisible hand,

00:00:33.547 --> 00:00:35.203
which is, "If you continue to operate

00:00:35.203 --> 00:00:37.316
in your own self-interest

00:00:37.316 --> 00:00:40.072
you will do the best good for society."

00:00:40.072 --> 00:00:44.803
Now, capitalism has done a lot of good things

00:00:44.803 --> 00:00:47.605
and I've talked about a lot of good 
things that have happened,

00:00:47.605 --> 00:00:50.991
but equally, it has not been able to meet up

00:00:50.991 --> 00:00:52.927
with some of the challenges that we've seen

00:00:52.927 --> 00:00:54.588
in society.

00:00:54.588 --> 00:00:56.802
The model that at least I was brought up in

00:00:56.802 --> 00:00:59.082
and a lot of us doing
business were brought up in

00:00:59.082 --> 00:01:00.791
was one which talked about

00:01:00.791 --> 00:01:03.219
what I call the three G's of growth:

00:01:03.219 --> 00:01:04.808
growth that is consistent,

00:01:04.808 --> 00:01:06.334
quarter on quarter;

00:01:06.334 --> 00:01:07.772
growth that is competitive,

00:01:07.772 --> 00:01:09.102
better than the other person;

00:01:09.102 --> 00:01:10.664
and growth that is profitable,

00:01:10.664 --> 00:01:12.153
so you continue to make

00:01:12.153 --> 00:01:15.072
more and more shareholder value.

00:01:15.072 --> 00:01:17.864
And I'm afraid this is not going to be good enough

00:01:17.864 --> 00:01:20.524
and we have to move from this 3G model

00:01:20.524 --> 00:01:22.838
to a model of what I call

00:01:22.838 --> 00:01:24.384
the fourth G:

00:01:24.384 --> 00:01:28.273
the G of growth that is responsible.

00:01:28.273 --> 00:01:31.710
And it is this that has to become

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.950
a very important part

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:35.825
of creating value.

00:01:35.825 --> 00:01:38.550
Of not just creating economic value

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:41.004
but creating social value.

00:01:41.004 --> 00:01:43.804
And companies that will thrive are those

00:01:43.804 --> 00:01:47.169
that will actually embrace the fourth G.

00:01:47.169 --> 00:01:50.194
And the model of 4G is quite simple:

00:01:50.194 --> 00:01:53.966
Companies cannot afford 
to be just innocent bystanders

00:01:53.966 --> 00:01:56.301
in what's happening around in society.

00:01:56.301 --> 00:01:59.868
They have to begin to play their role

00:01:59.868 --> 00:02:02.028
in terms of serving the communities

00:02:02.028 --> 00:02:04.126
which actually sustain them.

00:02:04.126 --> 00:02:05.823
And we have to move to a model

00:02:05.823 --> 00:02:07.916
of an and/and model which is

00:02:07.916 --> 00:02:11.398
how do we make money and do good?

00:02:11.398 --> 00:02:13.206
How do we make sure

00:02:13.206 --> 00:02:14.786
that we have a great business

00:02:14.786 --> 00:02:17.658
but we also have a great environment around us?

00:02:17.658 --> 00:02:18.978
And that model

00:02:18.978 --> 00:02:21.947
is all about doing well and doing good.

00:02:21.947 --> 00:02:24.268
But the question is easier said than done.

00:02:24.268 --> 00:02:26.405
But how do we actually get that done?

00:02:26.405 --> 00:02:27.751
And I do believe

00:02:27.751 --> 00:02:30.841
that the answer to that is going to be leadership.

00:02:30.841 --> 00:02:32.198
It is going to be to redefine

00:02:32.198 --> 00:02:34.068
the new business models

00:02:34.068 --> 00:02:35.414
which understand

00:02:35.414 --> 00:02:37.419
that the only license to operate

00:02:37.419 --> 00:02:39.556
is to combine these things.

00:02:39.556 --> 00:02:41.488
And for that you need businesses

00:02:41.488 --> 00:02:44.247
that can actually define their role

00:02:44.247 --> 00:02:46.332
in society

00:02:46.332 --> 00:02:47.976
in terms of a much larger purpose

00:02:47.976 --> 00:02:50.807
than the products and brands that they sell.

00:02:50.807 --> 00:02:54.040
And companies that actually define a true north,

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:55.786
things that are nonnegotiable

00:02:55.786 --> 00:02:58.346
whether times are good, bad, ugly --

00:02:58.346 --> 00:02:59.613
doesn't matter.

00:02:59.613 --> 00:03:01.779
There are things that you stand for.

00:03:01.779 --> 00:03:06.271
Values and purpose are going to be the two

00:03:06.271 --> 00:03:08.406
drivers of software

00:03:08.406 --> 00:03:10.118
that are going to create

00:03:10.118 --> 00:03:12.184
the companies of tomorrow.

00:03:12.184 --> 00:03:13.590
And I'm going to now shift

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:17.608
to talking a little bit about my own experiences.

00:03:17.608 --> 00:03:20.488
I joined Unilever in 1976

00:03:20.488 --> 00:03:23.621
as a management trainee in India.

00:03:23.621 --> 00:03:25.956
And on my first day of work

00:03:25.956 --> 00:03:28.290
I walked in and my boss tells me,

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:30.397
"Do you know why you're here?"

00:03:30.397 --> 00:03:33.694
I said, "I'm here to sell a lot of soap."

00:03:33.694 --> 00:03:36.780
And he said, 
"No, you're here to change lives."

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:39.072
You're here to change lives.

00:03:39.072 --> 00:03:40.702
You know, I thought it was rather facetious.

00:03:40.702 --> 00:03:43.517
We are a company that sells soap and soup.

00:03:43.517 --> 00:03:46.389
What are we doing about changing lives?

00:03:46.389 --> 00:03:50.404
And it's then I realized

00:03:50.404 --> 00:03:52.727
that simple acts

00:03:52.727 --> 00:03:55.159
like selling a bar of soap

00:03:55.159 --> 00:03:56.648
can save more lives

00:03:56.648 --> 00:03:58.125
than pharmaceutical companies.

00:03:58.125 --> 00:03:59.747
I don't know how many of you know

00:03:59.747 --> 00:04:03.082
that five million children don't reach the age of five

00:04:03.082 --> 00:04:05.958
because of simple infections that can be prevented

00:04:05.958 --> 00:04:08.898
by an act of washing their hands with soap.

00:04:08.898 --> 00:04:10.350
We run the largest

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:11.579
hand-washing program

00:04:11.579 --> 00:04:12.484
in the world.

00:04:12.484 --> 00:04:14.645
We are running a program on hygiene and health

00:04:14.645 --> 00:04:17.147
that now touches half a billion people.

00:04:17.147 --> 00:04:18.747
It's not about selling soap,

00:04:18.747 --> 00:04:20.708
there is a larger purpose out there.

00:04:20.708 --> 00:04:22.766
And brands indeed can be

00:04:22.766 --> 00:04:24.773
at the forefront of social change.

00:04:24.773 --> 00:04:26.430
And the reason for that is,

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:29.040
when two billion people use your brands

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:30.692
that's the amplifier.

00:04:30.692 --> 00:04:33.893
Small actions can make a big difference.

00:04:33.893 --> 00:04:35.431
Take another example,

00:04:35.431 --> 00:04:38.701
I was walking around in 
one of our villages in India.

00:04:38.701 --> 00:04:40.344
Now those of you who have done this

00:04:40.344 --> 00:04:45.518
will realize that this is no walk in the park.

00:04:45.518 --> 00:04:48.093
And we had this lady

00:04:48.093 --> 00:04:52.233
who was one of our small distributors --

00:04:52.233 --> 00:04:55.845
beautiful, very, very modest, her home --

00:04:55.845 --> 00:04:58.253
and she was out there,

00:04:58.253 --> 00:04:59.805
dressed nicely,

00:04:59.805 --> 00:05:01.965
her husband in the back, her mother-in-law behind

00:05:01.965 --> 00:05:04.191
and her sister-in-law behind her.

00:05:04.191 --> 00:05:06.263
The social order was changing

00:05:06.263 --> 00:05:08.013
because this lady

00:05:08.013 --> 00:05:10.149
is part of our Project Shakti

00:05:10.149 --> 00:05:12.433
that is actually teaching women

00:05:12.433 --> 00:05:14.304
how to do small business

00:05:14.304 --> 00:05:15.483
and how to carry the message

00:05:15.483 --> 00:05:18.126
of nutrition and hygiene.

00:05:18.126 --> 00:05:20.333
We have 60,000 such women

00:05:20.333 --> 00:05:22.185
now in India.

00:05:22.185 --> 00:05:24.638
It's not about selling soap,

00:05:24.638 --> 00:05:26.091
it's about making sure

00:05:26.091 --> 00:05:28.131
that in the process of doing so

00:05:28.131 --> 00:05:30.324
you can change people's lives.

00:05:30.324 --> 00:05:33.521
Small actions, big difference.

00:05:33.521 --> 00:05:35.240
Our R&amp;D folks

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:38.869
are not only working to give us 
some fantastic detergents,

00:05:38.869 --> 00:05:41.638
but they're working to make sure we use less water.

00:05:41.638 --> 00:05:43.802
A product that we've just launched recently,

00:05:43.802 --> 00:05:47.330
One Rinse product that allows you to save water

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:49.506
every time you wash your clothes.

00:05:49.506 --> 00:05:52.531
And if we can convert all our users to using this,

00:05:52.531 --> 00:05:54.764
that's 500 billion liters of water.

00:05:54.764 --> 00:05:57.058
By the way, that's equivalent to one month of water

00:05:57.058 --> 00:06:00.242
for a whole huge continent.

00:06:00.242 --> 00:06:01.918
So just think about it.

00:06:01.918 --> 00:06:05.485
There are small actions that 
can make a big difference.

00:06:05.485 --> 00:06:07.103
And I can go on and on.

00:06:07.103 --> 00:06:09.200
Our food chain, our brilliant products --

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:11.569
and I'm sorry I'm giving you 
a word from the sponsors --

00:06:11.569 --> 00:06:15.271
Knorr, Hellman's and all those wonderful products.

00:06:15.271 --> 00:06:17.331
We are committed to making sure that

00:06:17.331 --> 00:06:19.288
all our agricultural raw materials

00:06:19.288 --> 00:06:22.094
are sourced from sustainable sources,

00:06:22.094 --> 00:06:24.194
100-percent sustainable sources.

00:06:24.194 --> 00:06:25.742
We were the first

00:06:25.742 --> 00:06:27.951
to say we are going to buy all of our palm oil

00:06:27.951 --> 00:06:29.913
from sustainable sources.

00:06:29.913 --> 00:06:33.833
I don't know how many of you know that palm oil,

00:06:33.833 --> 00:06:36.246
and not buying it from sustainable sources,

00:06:36.246 --> 00:06:38.851
can create deforestation that is responsible

00:06:38.851 --> 00:06:41.393
for 20 percent of the greenhouse gasses in the world.

00:06:41.393 --> 00:06:43.909
We were the first to embrace that,

00:06:43.909 --> 00:06:48.307
and it's all because we market soap and soup.

00:06:48.307 --> 00:06:50.505
And the point I'm making here

00:06:50.505 --> 00:06:54.028
is that companies like yours, companies like mine

00:06:54.028 --> 00:06:56.151
have to define a purpose

00:06:56.151 --> 00:06:58.432
which embraces responsibility

00:06:58.432 --> 00:07:01.132
and understands that we have to play our part

00:07:01.132 --> 00:07:03.969
in the communities in which we operate.

00:07:03.969 --> 00:07:05.869
We introduced something called

00:07:05.869 --> 00:07:08.613
The Unilever Sustainable Living Plan, which said,

00:07:08.613 --> 00:07:11.499
"Our purpose is to make 
sustainable living commonplace,

00:07:11.499 --> 00:07:13.326
and we are gong to change the lives

00:07:13.326 --> 00:07:16.051
of one billion people over 2020."

00:07:16.051 --> 00:07:17.851
Now the question here is,

00:07:17.851 --> 00:07:19.375
where do we go from here?

00:07:19.375 --> 00:07:21.295
And the answer to that is very simple:

00:07:21.295 --> 00:07:23.428
We're not going to change the world alone.

00:07:23.428 --> 00:07:26.018
There are plenty of you and plenty of us

00:07:26.018 --> 00:07:27.488
who understand this.

00:07:27.488 --> 00:07:28.653
The question is,

00:07:28.653 --> 00:07:31.284
we need partnerships, we need coalitions

00:07:31.284 --> 00:07:33.740
and importantly, we need that leadership

00:07:33.740 --> 00:07:36.700
that will allow us to take this from here

00:07:36.700 --> 00:07:37.989
and to be the change

00:07:37.989 --> 00:07:39.525
that we want to see around us.

00:07:39.525 --> 00:07:40.845
Thank you very much.

00:07:40.845 --> 00:07:44.660
(Applause)
