00:00:12.727 --> 00:00:14.224
Joe Kowan: I have stage fright.

00:00:14.224 --> 00:00:15.717
I've always had stage fright,

00:00:15.717 --> 00:00:17.545
and not just a little bit,

00:00:17.545 --> 00:00:19.336
it's a big bit.

00:00:19.336 --> 00:00:22.129
And it didn't even matter until I was 27.

00:00:22.129 --> 00:00:24.687
That's when I started writing songs, and even then

00:00:24.687 --> 00:00:26.489
I only played them for myself.

00:00:26.489 --> 00:00:30.234
Just knowing my roommates were in the 
same house made me uncomfortable.

00:00:30.234 --> 00:00:33.041
But after a couple of years, 
just writing songs wasn't enough.

00:00:33.041 --> 00:00:36.060
I had all these stories and ideas,
and I wanted to share them with people,

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:39.366
but physiologically, I couldn't do it.

00:00:39.366 --> 00:00:42.292
I had this irrational fear.

00:00:42.292 --> 00:00:44.451
But the more I wrote, and the more I practiced,

00:00:44.451 --> 00:00:45.641
the more I wanted to perform.

00:00:45.641 --> 00:00:47.698
So on the week of my 30th birthday,

00:00:47.698 --> 00:00:50.651
I decided I was going to go to this local open mic,

00:00:50.651 --> 00:00:52.366
and put this fear behind me.

00:00:52.366 --> 00:00:55.223
Well, when I got there, it was packed.

00:00:55.223 --> 00:00:57.197
There were like 20 people there.

00:00:57.197 --> 00:00:59.080
(Laughter)

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:01.687
And they all looked angry.

00:01:01.687 --> 00:01:05.288
But I took a deep breath, and I signed up to play,

00:01:05.288 --> 00:01:06.780
and I felt pretty good.

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.841
Pretty good, until about 10 minutes before my turn,

00:01:09.841 --> 00:01:15.305
when my whole body rebelled, and 
this wave of anxiety just washed over me.

00:01:15.305 --> 00:01:18.860
Now, when you experience fear, 
your sympathetic nervous system kicks in.

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:21.703
So you have a rush of adrenaline, 
your heart rate increases,

00:01:21.703 --> 00:01:23.156
your breathing gets faster.

00:01:23.156 --> 00:01:29.328
Next your non-essential systems start 
to shut down, like digestion. (Laughter)

00:01:29.328 --> 00:01:32.692
So your mouth gets dry, and blood is routed
away from your extremities,

00:01:32.692 --> 00:01:35.292
so your fingers don't work anymore.

00:01:35.292 --> 00:01:38.424
Your pupils dilate, your muscles contract,
your Spidey sense tingles,

00:01:38.424 --> 00:01:43.598
basically your whole body is trigger-happy.
(Laughter)

00:01:43.598 --> 00:01:48.381
That condition is not conducive 
to performing folk music.

00:01:48.381 --> 00:01:49.950
(Laughter)

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.582
I mean, your nervous system is an idiot.

00:01:52.582 --> 00:01:56.392
Really? Two hundred thousand years of human evolution, and it still can't tell the difference

00:01:56.392 --> 00:01:58.764
between a saber tooth tiger and 20 folksingers

00:01:58.764 --> 00:02:00.835
on a Tuesday night open mic?

00:02:00.835 --> 00:02:02.266
(Laughter)

00:02:02.266 --> 00:02:06.323
I have never been more terrified -- until now.

00:02:06.323 --> 00:02:12.154
(Laughter and cheers)

00:02:15.398 --> 00:02:17.907
So then it was my turn,

00:02:17.907 --> 00:02:20.993
and somehow, I get myself onto 
the stage, I start my song,

00:02:20.993 --> 00:02:23.630
I open my mouth to sing the first line,

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:25.593
and this completely horrible vibrato --

00:02:25.593 --> 00:02:28.080
you know, when your voice wavers -- 
comes streaming out.

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:30.693
And this is not the good kind of vibrato, 
like an opera singer has,

00:02:30.693 --> 00:02:33.387
this is my whole body just convulsing with fear.

00:02:33.387 --> 00:02:35.038
I mean, it's a nightmare.

00:02:35.038 --> 00:02:37.506
I'm embarrassed, the audience 
is clearly uncomfortable,

00:02:37.506 --> 00:02:39.859
they're focused on my discomfort.

00:02:39.859 --> 00:02:43.634
It was so bad.

00:02:43.634 --> 00:02:47.571
But that was my first real experience 
as a solo singer-songwriter.

00:02:47.571 --> 00:02:50.586
And something good did happen --
I had the tiniest little glimpse

00:02:50.586 --> 00:02:53.069
of that audience connection that I was hoping for.

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:57.077
And I wanted more. But I knew 
I had to get past this nervousness.

00:02:57.077 --> 00:03:00.247
That night I promised myself: 
I would go back every week

00:03:00.247 --> 00:03:02.182
until I wasn't nervous anymore.

00:03:02.182 --> 00:03:05.065
And I did. I went back every single week,

00:03:05.065 --> 00:03:08.880
and sure enough, week after week,

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:13.050
it didn't get any better. The same 
thing happened every week. (Laughter)

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:14.998
I couldn't shake it.

00:03:14.998 --> 00:03:16.671
And that's when I had an epiphany.

00:03:16.671 --> 00:03:22.682
And I remember it really well, because I 
don't have a lot of epiphanies. (Laughter)

00:03:22.682 --> 00:03:26.311
All I had to do was write a song 
that exploits my nervousness.

00:03:26.311 --> 00:03:28.433
That only seems authentic when I have stage fright,

00:03:28.433 --> 00:03:29.721
and the more nervous I was,

00:03:29.721 --> 00:03:32.310
the better the song would be. Easy.

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:37.139
So I started writing a song about having stage fright.

00:03:37.139 --> 00:03:39.200
First, fessing up to the problem,

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:41.028
the physical manifestations, how I would feel,

00:03:41.028 --> 00:03:42.457
how the listener might feel.

00:03:42.457 --> 00:03:45.065
And then accounting for things like my shaky voice,

00:03:45.065 --> 00:03:47.997
and I knew I would be singing about a 
half-octave higher than normal,

00:03:47.997 --> 00:03:50.111
because I was nervous.

00:03:50.111 --> 00:03:53.183
By having a song that explained 
what was happening to me,

00:03:53.183 --> 00:03:54.670
while it was happening,

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:56.533
that gave the audience permission to think about it.

00:03:56.533 --> 00:03:59.294
They didn't have to feel bad 
for me because I was nervous,

00:03:59.294 --> 00:04:01.012
they could experience that with me,

00:04:01.012 --> 00:04:06.261
and we were all one big happy, nervous, 
uncomfortable family. (Laughter)

00:04:06.261 --> 00:04:11.070
By thinking about my audience, 
by embracing and exploiting my problem,

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:14.005
I was able to take something 
that was blocking my progress,

00:04:14.005 --> 00:04:17.942
and turn it into something that 
was essential for my success.

00:04:17.942 --> 00:04:20.962
And having the stage fright song let 
me get past that biggest issue

00:04:20.962 --> 00:04:22.780
right in the beginning of a performance.

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:24.324
And then I could move on, 
and play the rest of my songs

00:04:24.324 --> 00:04:27.578
with just a little bit more ease.

00:04:27.578 --> 00:04:33.854
And eventually, over time, I didn't 
have to play the stage fright song at all.

00:04:33.854 --> 00:04:39.574
Except for when I was really 
nervous, like now. (Laughter)

00:04:41.095 --> 00:04:43.820
Would it be okay if I played the 
stage fright song for you?

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:48.812
(Applause)

00:04:52.903 --> 00:04:55.865
Can I have a sip of water?

00:04:55.865 --> 00:04:59.816
(Music)

00:05:00.293 --> 00:05:02.670
Thank you.

00:05:07.592 --> 00:05:10.513
♫ I'm not joking, you know, ♫

00:05:10.513 --> 00:05:16.141
♫ this stage fright is real. ♫

00:05:16.141 --> 00:05:19.352
♫ And if I'm up here trembling and singing, ♫

00:05:19.352 --> 00:05:23.698
♫ well, you'll know how I feel. ♫

00:05:23.698 --> 00:05:27.618
♫ And the mistake I'd be making, ♫

00:05:27.618 --> 00:05:31.546
♫ the tremolo caused by my whole body shaking. ♫

00:05:31.546 --> 00:05:35.013
♫ As you sit there feeling embarrassed for me, ♫

00:05:35.013 --> 00:05:38.059
♫ well, you don't have to be. ♫

00:05:38.059 --> 00:05:40.574
♫ Well, maybe just a little bit. ♫

00:05:40.574 --> 00:05:41.975
(Laughter)

00:05:41.975 --> 00:05:49.854
♫ And maybe I'll try to imagine 
you all without clothes. ♫

00:05:49.854 --> 00:05:57.727
♫ But singing in front of all naked strangers
scares me more than anyone knows. ♫

00:05:57.727 --> 00:06:01.680
♫ Not to discuss this at length, ♫

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:06.925
♫ but my body image was never my strength. ♫

00:06:06.925 --> 00:06:10.463
♫ So frankly, I wish that you all would get dressed, ♫

00:06:10.463 --> 00:06:15.353
♫ I mean, you're not even really naked. ♫

00:06:15.353 --> 00:06:18.696
♫ And I'm the one with the problem. ♫

00:06:18.696 --> 00:06:25.964
♫ And you tell me, don't worry 
so much, you'll be great. ♫

00:06:25.964 --> 00:06:28.768
♫ But I'm the one living with me ♫

00:06:28.768 --> 00:06:31.086
♫ and I know how I get. ♫

00:06:31.086 --> 00:06:35.230
♫ Your advice is gentle but late. ♫

00:06:35.230 --> 00:06:38.679
♫ If not just a bit patronizing. ♫

00:06:38.679 --> 00:06:43.511
♫ And that sarcastic tone doesn't 
help me when I sing. ♫

00:06:43.511 --> 00:06:47.399
♫ But we shouldn't talk about 
these things right now, ♫

00:06:47.399 --> 00:06:54.286
♫ really, I'm up on stage, and 
you're in the crowd. Hi. ♫

00:06:54.286 --> 00:07:03.509
♫ And I'm not making fun of 
unnurtured, irrational fear, ♫

00:07:03.509 --> 00:07:06.425
♫ and if I wasn't ready to face this, ♫

00:07:06.425 --> 00:07:10.957
♫ I sure as hell wouldn't be here. ♫

00:07:10.957 --> 00:07:16.095
♫ But if I belt one note out clearly, ♫

00:07:16.095 --> 00:07:20.381
♫ you'll know I'm recovering slowly but surely. ♫

00:07:20.381 --> 00:07:24.344
♫ And maybe next week, I'll set my guitar ringin' ♫

00:07:24.344 --> 00:07:28.698
♫ my voice clear as water, and everyone singin'. ♫

00:07:28.698 --> 00:07:32.465
♫ But probably I'll just get up and start groovin', ♫

00:07:32.465 --> 00:07:35.872
♫ my vocal cords movin', ♫

00:07:35.872 --> 00:07:44.235
♫ at speeds slightly faster than sound. ♫

00:07:48.174 --> 00:07:53.977
(Applause)
