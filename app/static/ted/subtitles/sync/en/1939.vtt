00:00:12.757 --> 00:00:15.265
I had brain surgery 18 years ago,

00:00:15.265 --> 00:00:17.832
and since that time, brain science has become

00:00:17.832 --> 00:00:19.831
a personal passion of mine.

00:00:19.831 --> 00:00:22.066
I'm actually an engineer.

00:00:22.066 --> 00:00:24.582
And first let me say, I recently joined

00:00:24.582 --> 00:00:26.131
Google's Moonshot group,

00:00:26.131 --> 00:00:27.343
where I had a division,

00:00:27.343 --> 00:00:29.524
the display division in Google X,

00:00:29.524 --> 00:00:32.146
and the brain science work I'm speaking about today

00:00:32.146 --> 00:00:35.067
is work I did before I joined Google

00:00:35.067 --> 00:00:37.399
and on the side outside of Google.

00:00:37.399 --> 00:00:40.582
So that said, there's a stigma

00:00:40.582 --> 00:00:42.867
when you have brain surgery.

00:00:42.867 --> 00:00:45.690
Are you still smart or not?

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.538
And if not, can you make yourself smart again?

00:00:49.538 --> 00:00:51.304
After my neurosurgery,

00:00:51.304 --> 00:00:53.301
part of my brain was missing,

00:00:53.301 --> 00:00:56.074
and I had to deal with that.

00:00:56.074 --> 00:00:59.018
It wasn't the grey matter, but it 
was the gooey part dead center

00:00:59.018 --> 00:01:02.420
that makes key hormones and neurotransmitters.

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:04.651
Immediately after my surgery,

00:01:04.651 --> 00:01:06.794
I had to decide what amounts of each of over

00:01:06.794 --> 00:01:10.496
a dozen powerful chemicals to take each day,

00:01:10.496 --> 00:01:12.305
because if I just took nothing,

00:01:12.305 --> 00:01:15.037
I would die within hours.

00:01:15.037 --> 00:01:18.957
Every day now for 18 years -- every single day --

00:01:18.957 --> 00:01:21.667
I've had to try to decide the combinations

00:01:21.667 --> 00:01:22.995
and mixtures of chemicals,

00:01:22.995 --> 00:01:26.842
and try to get them, to stay alive.

00:01:26.842 --> 00:01:29.563
There have been several close calls.

00:01:29.563 --> 00:01:33.262
But luckily, I'm an experimentalist at heart,

00:01:33.262 --> 00:01:36.489
so I decided I would experiment

00:01:36.489 --> 00:01:38.929
to try to find more optimal dosages

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:40.566
because there really isn't a clear road map

00:01:40.566 --> 00:01:42.469
on this that's detailed.

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:44.620
I began to try different mixtures,

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:47.492
and I was blown away by how

00:01:47.492 --> 00:01:49.903
tiny changes in dosages

00:01:49.903 --> 00:01:53.052
dramatically changed my sense of self,

00:01:53.052 --> 00:01:54.863
my sense of who I was, my thinking,

00:01:54.863 --> 00:01:57.122
my behavior towards people.

00:01:57.122 --> 00:01:59.171
One particularly dramatic case:

00:01:59.171 --> 00:02:01.039
for a couple months I actually tried dosages

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:04.947
and chemicals typical of a man in his early 20s,

00:02:04.947 --> 00:02:07.958
and I was blown away by how my thoughts changed.

00:02:07.958 --> 00:02:11.078
(Laughter)

00:02:11.078 --> 00:02:14.136
I was angry all the time,

00:02:14.136 --> 00:02:15.982
I thought about sex constantly,

00:02:15.982 --> 00:02:18.931
and I thought I was the smartest person

00:02:18.931 --> 00:02:20.982
in the entire world, and

00:02:20.982 --> 00:02:23.245
—(Laughter)—

00:02:23.245 --> 00:02:26.170
of course over the years I'd
met guys kind of like that,

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:28.437
or maybe kind of toned-down versions of that.

00:02:28.437 --> 00:02:30.621
I was kind of extreme.

00:02:30.621 --> 00:02:33.190
But to me, the surprise was,

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:35.356
I wasn't trying to be arrogant.

00:02:35.356 --> 00:02:38.565
I was actually trying,

00:02:38.565 --> 00:02:40.925
with a little bit of insecurity,

00:02:40.925 --> 00:02:43.925
to actually fix a problem in front of me,

00:02:43.925 --> 00:02:45.781
and it just didn't come out that way.

00:02:45.781 --> 00:02:47.264
So I couldn't handle it.

00:02:47.264 --> 00:02:48.789
I changed my dosages.

00:02:48.789 --> 00:02:51.244
But that experience, I think, gave me

00:02:51.244 --> 00:02:52.995
a new appreciation for men

00:02:52.995 --> 00:02:54.811
and what they might walk through,

00:02:54.811 --> 00:02:56.501
and I've gotten along with men

00:02:56.501 --> 00:02:58.340
a lot better since then.

00:02:58.340 --> 00:02:59.885
What I was trying to do

00:02:59.885 --> 00:03:01.913
with tuning these hormones

00:03:01.913 --> 00:03:04.236
and neurotransmitters and so forth

00:03:04.236 --> 00:03:07.841
was to try to get my intelligence back

00:03:07.841 --> 00:03:10.475
after my illness and surgery,

00:03:10.475 --> 00:03:13.110
my creative thought, my idea flow.

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:15.751
And I think mostly in images,

00:03:15.751 --> 00:03:18.603
and so for me that became a key metric --

00:03:18.603 --> 00:03:20.933
how to get these mental images

00:03:20.933 --> 00:03:23.437
that I use as a way of rapid prototyping,

00:03:23.437 --> 00:03:25.180
if you will, my ideas,

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:27.552
trying on different new ideas for size,

00:03:27.552 --> 00:03:29.247
playing out scenarios.

00:03:29.247 --> 00:03:31.160
This kind of thinking isn't new.

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:34.415
Philiosophers like Hume and Descartes and Hobbes

00:03:34.415 --> 00:03:35.943
saw things similarly.

00:03:35.943 --> 00:03:38.680
They thought that mental images and ideas

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:41.011
were actually the same thing.

00:03:41.011 --> 00:03:43.428
There are those today that dispute that,

00:03:43.428 --> 00:03:46.623
and lots of debates about how the mind works,

00:03:46.623 --> 00:03:48.359
but for me it's simple:

00:03:48.359 --> 00:03:50.891
Mental images, for most of us,

00:03:50.891 --> 00:03:54.825
are central in inventive and creative thinking.

00:03:54.825 --> 00:03:56.600
So after several years,

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:59.833
I tuned myself up and I have lots of great,

00:03:59.833 --> 00:04:02.881
really vivid mental images with a lot of sophistication

00:04:02.881 --> 00:04:05.150
and the analytical backbone behind them.

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:07.071
And so now I'm working on,

00:04:07.071 --> 00:04:11.233
how can I get these mental images in my mind

00:04:11.233 --> 00:04:14.083
out to my computer screen faster?

00:04:14.083 --> 00:04:16.172
Can you imagine, if you will,

00:04:16.172 --> 00:04:18.292
a movie director being able to use

00:04:18.292 --> 00:04:22.054
her imagination alone to
direct the world in front of her?

00:04:22.054 --> 00:04:25.642
Or a musician to get the music out of his head?

00:04:25.642 --> 00:04:27.934
There are incredible possibilities with this

00:04:27.934 --> 00:04:29.927
as a way for creative people

00:04:29.927 --> 00:04:32.160
to share at light speed.

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:34.158
And the truth is, the remaining bottleneck

00:04:34.158 --> 00:04:35.331
in being able to do this

00:04:35.331 --> 00:04:39.311
is just upping the resolution of brain scan systems.

00:04:39.311 --> 00:04:42.169
So let me show you why I think 
we're pretty close to getting there

00:04:42.179 --> 00:04:44.566
by sharing with you two recent experiments

00:04:44.566 --> 00:04:47.153
from two top neuroscience groups.

00:04:47.153 --> 00:04:49.641
Both used fMRI technology --

00:04:49.641 --> 00:04:51.920
functional magnetic resonance imaging technology --

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:53.331
to image the brain,

00:04:53.331 --> 00:04:56.588
and here is a brain scan set from Giorgio Ganis

00:04:56.588 --> 00:04:58.538
and his colleagues at Harvard.

00:04:58.538 --> 00:05:01.692
And the left-hand column shows a brain scan

00:05:01.692 --> 00:05:04.959
of a person looking at an image.

00:05:04.959 --> 00:05:06.888
The middle column shows the brainscan

00:05:06.888 --> 00:05:08.509
of that same individual

00:05:08.509 --> 00:05:11.575
imagining, seeing that same image.

00:05:11.575 --> 00:05:13.623
And the right column was created

00:05:13.623 --> 00:05:17.217
by subtracting the middle 
column from the left column,

00:05:17.233 --> 00:05:20.176
showing the difference to be nearly zero.

00:05:20.176 --> 00:05:23.070
This was repeated on lots of different individuals

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:25.900
with lots of different images,

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:27.504
always with a similar result.

00:05:27.504 --> 00:05:29.593
The difference between seeing an image

00:05:29.593 --> 00:05:32.048
and imagining seeing that same image

00:05:32.048 --> 00:05:34.203
is next to nothing.

00:05:34.203 --> 00:05:36.964
Next let me share with you one other experiment,

00:05:36.964 --> 00:05:41.505
this from Jack Gallant's lab at Cal Berkeley.

00:05:41.505 --> 00:05:43.568
They've been able to decode brainwaves

00:05:43.568 --> 00:05:46.009
into recognizable visual fields.

00:05:46.009 --> 00:05:47.314
So let me set this up for you.

00:05:47.314 --> 00:05:49.647
In this experiment, individuals were shown

00:05:49.647 --> 00:05:51.642
hundreds of hours of YouTube videos

00:05:51.642 --> 00:05:53.681
while scans were made of their brains

00:05:53.681 --> 00:05:56.897
to create a large library of their brain reacting

00:05:56.897 --> 00:05:59.546
to video sequences.

00:05:59.546 --> 00:06:02.396
Then a new movie was shown with new images,

00:06:02.396 --> 00:06:04.348
new people, new animals in it,

00:06:04.348 --> 00:06:07.059
and a new scan set was recorded.

00:06:07.059 --> 00:06:09.847
The computer, using brain scan data alone,

00:06:09.847 --> 00:06:11.871
decoded that new brain scan

00:06:11.871 --> 00:06:16.247
to show what it thought the 
individual was actually seeing.

00:06:16.247 --> 00:06:19.628
On the right-hand side, you
see the computer's guess,

00:06:19.628 --> 00:06:23.635
and on the left-hand side, the presented clip.

00:06:23.635 --> 00:06:25.954
This is the jaw-dropper.

00:06:25.954 --> 00:06:28.641
We are so close to being able to do this.

00:06:28.641 --> 00:06:31.426
We just need to up the resolution.

00:06:31.426 --> 00:06:34.678
And now remember that when you see an image

00:06:34.678 --> 00:06:36.836
versus when you imagine that same image,

00:06:36.836 --> 00:06:40.311
it creates the same brain scan.

00:06:40.311 --> 00:06:43.033
So this was done with the highest-resolution

00:06:43.033 --> 00:06:45.218
brain scan systems available today,

00:06:45.218 --> 00:06:47.002
and their resolution has increased really

00:06:47.002 --> 00:06:50.499
about a thousandfold in the last several years.

00:06:50.499 --> 00:06:52.821
Next we need to increase the resolution

00:06:52.821 --> 00:06:54.798
another thousandfold

00:06:54.798 --> 00:06:56.587
to get a deeper glimpse.

00:06:56.587 --> 00:06:58.098
How do we do that?

00:06:58.098 --> 00:07:00.712
There's a lot of techniques in this approach.

00:07:00.712 --> 00:07:03.830
One way is to crack open your
skull and put in electrodes.

00:07:03.830 --> 00:07:05.233
I'm not for that.

00:07:05.233 --> 00:07:08.188
There's a lot of new imaging techniques

00:07:08.188 --> 00:07:10.191
being proposed, some even by me,

00:07:10.191 --> 00:07:13.150
but given the recent success of MRI,

00:07:13.150 --> 00:07:15.218
first we need to ask the question,

00:07:15.218 --> 00:07:18.059
is it the end of the road with this technology?

00:07:18.059 --> 00:07:20.514
Conventional wisdom says the only way

00:07:20.514 --> 00:07:23.103
to get higher resolution is with bigger magnets,

00:07:23.103 --> 00:07:24.945
but at this point bigger magnets

00:07:24.945 --> 00:07:28.695
only offer incremental resolution improvements,

00:07:28.695 --> 00:07:30.855
not the thousandfold we need.

00:07:30.855 --> 00:07:32.678
I'm putting forward an idea:

00:07:32.678 --> 00:07:34.641
instead of bigger magnets,

00:07:34.641 --> 00:07:37.091
let's make better magnets.

00:07:37.091 --> 00:07:39.094
There's some new technology breakthroughs

00:07:39.094 --> 00:07:40.551
in nanoscience

00:07:40.551 --> 00:07:42.278
when applied to magnetic structures

00:07:42.278 --> 00:07:45.291
that have created a whole new class of magnets,

00:07:45.291 --> 00:07:47.822
and with these magnets, we can lay down

00:07:47.822 --> 00:07:49.989
very fine detailed magnetic field patterns

00:07:49.989 --> 00:07:51.344
throughout the brain,

00:07:51.344 --> 00:07:54.526
and using those, we can actually create

00:07:54.526 --> 00:07:57.364
holographic-like interference structures

00:07:57.364 --> 00:08:00.833
to get precision control over many patterns,

00:08:00.833 --> 00:08:03.278
as is shown here by shifting things.

00:08:03.278 --> 00:08:06.428
We can create much more complicated structures

00:08:06.428 --> 00:08:08.499
with slightly different arrangements,

00:08:08.499 --> 00:08:11.532
kind of like making Spirograph.

00:08:11.532 --> 00:08:13.760
So why does that matter?

00:08:13.760 --> 00:08:16.337
A lot of effort in MRI over the years

00:08:16.337 --> 00:08:19.174
has gone into making really big,

00:08:19.174 --> 00:08:21.784
really huge magnets, right?

00:08:21.784 --> 00:08:24.293
But yet most of the recent advances

00:08:24.293 --> 00:08:26.490
in resolution have actually come from

00:08:26.490 --> 00:08:30.498
ingeniously clever encoding and decoding solutions

00:08:30.498 --> 00:08:33.785
in the F.M. radio frequency transmitters and receivers

00:08:33.785 --> 00:08:36.476
in the MRI systems.

00:08:36.476 --> 00:08:39.798
Let's also, instead of a uniform magnetic field,

00:08:39.798 --> 00:08:42.470
put down structured magnetic patterns

00:08:42.470 --> 00:08:45.569
in addition to the F.M. radio frequencies.

00:08:45.569 --> 00:08:47.876
So by combining the magnetics patterns

00:08:47.876 --> 00:08:50.586
with the patterns in the F.M. radio frequencies

00:08:50.586 --> 00:08:52.757
processing which can massively increase

00:08:52.757 --> 00:08:54.726
the information that we can extract

00:08:54.726 --> 00:08:57.172
in a single scan.

00:08:57.172 --> 00:08:59.504
And on top of that, we can then layer

00:08:59.504 --> 00:09:03.976
our ever-growing knowledge 
of brain structure and memory

00:09:03.976 --> 00:09:07.671
to create a thousandfold increase that we need.

00:09:07.671 --> 00:09:10.614
And using fMRI, we should be able to measure

00:09:10.614 --> 00:09:12.696
not just oxygenated blood flow,

00:09:12.696 --> 00:09:15.597
but the hormones and neurotransmitters 
I've talked about

00:09:15.597 --> 00:09:17.942
and maybe even the direct neural activity,

00:09:17.942 --> 00:09:19.445
which is the dream.

00:09:19.445 --> 00:09:21.679
We're going to be able to dump our ideas

00:09:21.679 --> 00:09:24.373
directly to digital media.

00:09:24.373 --> 00:09:27.084
Could you imagine if we could leapfrog language

00:09:27.084 --> 00:09:31.293
and communicate directly with human thought?

00:09:31.293 --> 00:09:34.486
What would we be capable of then?

00:09:34.486 --> 00:09:37.123
And how will we learn to deal

00:09:37.123 --> 00:09:41.342
with the truths of unfiltered human thought?

00:09:41.342 --> 00:09:43.909
You think the Internet was big.

00:09:43.909 --> 00:09:46.511
These are huge questions.

00:09:46.511 --> 00:09:48.659
It might be irresistible as a tool

00:09:48.659 --> 00:09:52.535
to amplify our thinking and communication skills.

00:09:52.535 --> 00:09:54.558
And indeed, this very same tool

00:09:54.558 --> 00:09:56.684
may prove to lead to the cure

00:09:56.684 --> 00:09:59.758
for Alzheimer's and similar diseases.

00:09:59.758 --> 00:10:03.270
We have little option but to open this door.

00:10:03.270 --> 00:10:04.855
Regardless, pick a year --

00:10:04.855 --> 00:10:07.121
will it happen in five years or 15 years?

00:10:07.121 --> 00:10:11.737
It's hard to imagine it taking much longer.

00:10:11.737 --> 00:10:15.432
We need to learn how to take this step together.

00:10:15.432 --> 00:10:17.606
Thank you.

00:10:17.606 --> 00:10:21.580
(Applause)
