WEBVTT

00:00:12.897 --> 00:00:15.220
The year is 1800.

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:18.276
A curious little invention is being talked about.

00:00:18.276 --> 00:00:21.357
It's called a microscope.

00:00:21.357 --> 00:00:23.136
What it allows you to do

00:00:23.136 --> 00:00:25.778
is see tiny little lifeforms

00:00:25.778 --> 00:00:28.265
that are invisible to the naked eye.

00:00:28.265 --> 00:00:30.293
Soon comes the medical discovery

00:00:30.293 --> 00:00:33.378
that many of these lifeforms are actually causes

00:00:33.378 --> 00:00:35.569
of terrible human diseases.

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:38.354
Imagine what happened to the society

00:00:38.354 --> 00:00:40.342
when they realized

00:00:40.342 --> 00:00:43.158
that an English mom in her teacup

00:00:43.158 --> 00:00:46.294
actually was drinking a monster soup,

00:00:46.294 --> 00:00:49.443
not very far from here. This is from London.

00:00:49.443 --> 00:00:52.285
Fast forward 200 years.

00:00:52.285 --> 00:00:54.417
We still have this monster soup around,

00:00:54.417 --> 00:00:57.272
and it's taken hold in the developing countries

00:00:57.272 --> 00:00:59.688
around the tropical belt.

00:00:59.688 --> 00:01:02.251
Just for malaria itself,

00:01:02.251 --> 00:01:04.696
there are a million deaths a year,

00:01:04.696 --> 00:01:06.442
and more than a billion people

00:01:06.442 --> 00:01:09.090
that need to be tested because they are at risk

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.325
for different species of malarial infections.

00:01:12.325 --> 00:01:15.136
Now it's actually very simple to put a face

00:01:15.136 --> 00:01:16.931
to many of these monsters.

00:01:16.931 --> 00:01:19.558
You take a stain, like acridine orange

00:01:19.558 --> 00:01:21.675
or a fluorescent stain or Giemsa,

00:01:21.675 --> 00:01:24.788
and a microscope, and you look at them.

00:01:24.788 --> 00:01:27.168
They all have faces.

00:01:27.168 --> 00:01:29.806
Why is that so, that Alex in Kenya,

00:01:29.806 --> 00:01:33.034
Fatima in Bangladesh, Navjoot in Mumbai,

00:01:33.034 --> 00:01:36.455
and Julie and Mary in Uganda still wait months

00:01:36.455 --> 00:01:40.034
to be able to diagnose why they are sick?

00:01:40.034 --> 00:01:43.060
And that's primarily because scalability

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:46.092
of the diagnostics is completely out of reach.

00:01:46.092 --> 00:01:50.008
And remember that number: one billion.

00:01:50.008 --> 00:01:53.909
The problem lies with the microscope itself.

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:56.285
Even though the pinnacle of modern science,

00:01:56.285 --> 00:01:59.420
research microscopes are
not designed for field testing.

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:01.100
Neither were they first designed

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:03.251
for diagnostics at all.

00:02:03.251 --> 00:02:06.639
They are heavy, bulky, really hard to maintain,

00:02:06.639 --> 00:02:08.940
and cost a lot of money.

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:12.345
This picture is Mahatma Gandhi in the '40s

00:02:12.345 --> 00:02:15.639
using the exact same setup
that we actually use today

00:02:15.639 --> 00:02:18.323
for diagnosing T.B. in his ashram

00:02:18.323 --> 00:02:20.768
in Sevagram in India.

00:02:20.768 --> 00:02:24.095
Two of my students, Jim and James,

00:02:24.095 --> 00:02:26.415
traveled around India and Thailand,

00:02:26.415 --> 00:02:28.667
starting to think about this problem a lot.

00:02:28.667 --> 00:02:31.142
We saw all kinds of donated equipment.

00:02:31.142 --> 00:02:34.054
We saw fungus growing on microscope lenses.

00:02:34.054 --> 00:02:36.249
And we saw people who had a functional microscope

00:02:36.249 --> 00:02:39.200
but just didn't know how to even turn it on.

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:41.840
What grew out of that work and that trip

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:45.591
was actually the idea of what we call Foldscopes.

00:02:45.591 --> 00:02:47.414
So what is a Foldscope?

00:02:47.414 --> 00:02:50.963
A Foldscope is a completely functional microscope,

00:02:50.963 --> 00:02:54.093
a platform for fluorescence, bright-field,

00:02:54.093 --> 00:02:55.668
polarization, projection,

00:02:55.668 --> 00:02:58.236
all kinds of advanced microscopy

00:02:58.236 --> 00:03:01.451
built purely by folding paper.

00:03:01.451 --> 00:03:04.312
So, now you think, how is that possible?

00:03:04.312 --> 00:03:06.275
I'm going to show you some examples here,

00:03:06.275 --> 00:03:08.076
and we will run through some of them.

00:03:08.076 --> 00:03:11.860
It starts with a single sheet of paper.

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:15.231
What you see here is all the possible components

00:03:15.231 --> 00:03:19.656
to build a functional bright-field
and fluorescence microscope.

00:03:19.656 --> 00:03:21.465
So, there are three stages:

00:03:21.465 --> 00:03:24.214
There is the optical stage, the illumination stage

00:03:24.214 --> 00:03:26.682
and the mask-holding stage.

00:03:26.682 --> 00:03:28.554
And there are micro optics at the bottom

00:03:28.554 --> 00:03:31.428
that's actually embedded in the paper itself.

00:03:31.428 --> 00:03:33.932
What you do is, you take it on,

00:03:33.932 --> 00:03:36.708
and just like you are playing like a toy,

00:03:36.708 --> 00:03:39.795
which it is,

00:03:40.734 --> 00:03:43.764
I tab it off,

00:03:47.189 --> 00:03:49.371
and I break it off.

00:03:49.371 --> 00:03:52.095
This paper has no instructions and no languages.

00:03:52.095 --> 00:03:54.414
There is a code, a color code embedded,

00:03:54.414 --> 00:03:59.025
that tells you exactly how to
fold that specific microscope.

00:03:59.025 --> 00:04:01.674
When it's done, it looks something like this,

00:04:01.674 --> 00:04:04.405
has all the functionalities of a standard microscope,

00:04:04.405 --> 00:04:06.286
just like an XY stage,

00:04:06.286 --> 00:04:10.707
a place where a sample slide could go,

00:04:10.707 --> 00:04:13.247
for example right here.

00:04:13.247 --> 00:04:14.759
We didn't want to change this,

00:04:14.759 --> 00:04:16.131
because this is the standard

00:04:16.131 --> 00:04:17.984
that's been optimized for over the years,

00:04:17.984 --> 00:04:20.680
and many health workers are actually used to this.

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:22.141
So this is what changes,

00:04:22.141 --> 00:04:24.308
but the standard stains all remain the same

00:04:24.308 --> 00:04:26.083
for many different diseases.

00:04:26.083 --> 00:04:29.015
You pop this in.

00:04:29.015 --> 00:04:32.901
There is an XY stage,

00:04:32.901 --> 00:04:34.874
and then there is a focusing stage,

00:04:34.874 --> 00:04:36.740
which is a flexure mechanism

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:39.293
that's built in paper itself that allows us to move

00:04:39.293 --> 00:04:42.274
and focus the lenses by micron steps.

00:04:42.274 --> 00:04:44.407
So what's really interesting about this object,

00:04:44.407 --> 00:04:46.290
and my students hate when I do this,

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:48.051
but I'm going to do this anyway,

00:04:48.051 --> 00:04:50.007
is these are rugged devices.

00:04:50.007 --> 00:04:54.584
I can turn it on and throw it on the floor

00:04:54.584 --> 00:04:57.536
and really try to stomp on it.

00:04:57.536 --> 00:04:59.911
And they last, even though they're designed

00:04:59.911 --> 00:05:03.374
from a very flexible material, like paper.

00:05:03.374 --> 00:05:06.226
Another fun fact is, this is what we actually

00:05:06.226 --> 00:05:10.281
send out there as a standard diagnostic tool,

00:05:10.281 --> 00:05:12.050
but here in this envelope

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:14.441
I have 30 different foldscopes

00:05:14.441 --> 00:05:20.172
of different configurations all in a single folder.

00:05:20.172 --> 00:05:21.984
And I'm going to pick one randomly.

00:05:21.984 --> 00:05:24.066
This one, it turns out, is actually designed

00:05:24.066 --> 00:05:25.629
specifically for malaria,

00:05:25.629 --> 00:05:27.940
because it has the fluorescent filters built

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:30.037
specifically for diagnosing malaria.

00:05:30.037 --> 00:05:33.965
So the idea of very specific diagnostic microscopes

00:05:33.965 --> 00:05:35.731
comes out of this.

00:05:35.731 --> 00:05:38.670
So up till now, you didn't actually see

00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:41.627
what I would see from one of these setups.

00:05:41.627 --> 00:05:43.308
So what I would like to do is,

00:05:43.308 --> 00:05:44.934
if we could dim the lights, please,

00:05:44.934 --> 00:05:48.599
it turns out foldscopes are
also projection microscopes.

00:05:48.599 --> 00:05:51.133
I have these two microscopes that I'm going to turn --

00:05:51.133 --> 00:05:52.886
go to the back of the wall --

00:05:52.886 --> 00:05:54.594
and just project, and this way you will see

00:05:54.594 --> 00:05:56.714
exactly what I would see.

00:05:56.714 --> 00:05:58.500
What you're looking at --

00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:00.883
(Applause) —

00:06:00.883 --> 00:06:03.519
This is a cross-section of a compound eye,

00:06:03.519 --> 00:06:05.870
and when I'm going to zoom in closer, right there,

00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:08.114
I am going through the z-axis.

00:06:08.114 --> 00:06:11.138
You actually see how the lenses are cut together

00:06:11.138 --> 00:06:12.711
in the cross-section pattern.

00:06:12.711 --> 00:06:15.267
Another example, one of my favorite insects,

00:06:15.267 --> 00:06:17.244
I love to hate this one,

00:06:17.244 --> 00:06:19.025
is a mosquito,

00:06:19.025 --> 00:06:22.787
and you're seeing the antenna of a culex pipiens.

00:06:22.787 --> 00:06:26.150
Right there.

00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:30.363
All from the simple setup that I actually described.

00:06:30.363 --> 00:06:32.136
So my wife has been field testing

00:06:32.136 --> 00:06:34.136
some of our microscopes

00:06:34.136 --> 00:06:36.617
by washing my clothes whenever I forget them

00:06:36.617 --> 00:06:38.646
in the dryer.

00:06:38.646 --> 00:06:41.446
So it turns out they're waterproof, and --

00:06:41.446 --> 00:06:43.234
(Laughter) —

00:06:43.234 --> 00:06:45.732
right here is just fluorescent water,

00:06:45.732 --> 00:06:47.282
and I don't know if you can actually see this.

00:06:47.282 --> 00:06:49.671
This also shows you how 
the projection scope works.

00:06:49.671 --> 00:06:53.324
You get to see the beam the 
way it's projected and bent.

00:06:56.349 --> 00:06:59.289
Can we get the lights back on again?

00:06:59.289 --> 00:07:01.076
So I'm quickly going to show you,

00:07:01.076 --> 00:07:03.125
since I'm running out of time,

00:07:03.125 --> 00:07:05.551
in terms of how much it costs for us to manufacture,

00:07:05.551 --> 00:07:08.631
the biggest idea was roll-to-roll manufacturing,

00:07:08.631 --> 00:07:11.753
so we built this out of 50 cents of parts and costs.

00:07:11.753 --> 00:07:14.612
(Applause)

00:07:14.612 --> 00:07:16.707
And what this allows us to do

00:07:16.707 --> 00:07:19.043
is to think about a new paradigm in microscopy,

00:07:19.043 --> 00:07:21.060
which we call use-and-throw microscopy.

00:07:21.060 --> 00:07:23.149
I'm going to give you a quick snapshot

00:07:23.149 --> 00:07:24.912
of some of the parts that go in.

00:07:24.912 --> 00:07:26.371
Here is a sheet of paper.

00:07:26.371 --> 00:07:28.460
This is when we were thinking about the idea.

00:07:28.460 --> 00:07:29.815
This is an A4 sheet of paper.

00:07:29.815 --> 00:07:31.796
These are the three stages that you actually see.

00:07:31.796 --> 00:07:35.226
And the optical components, if you
look at the inset up on the right,

00:07:35.226 --> 00:07:37.653
we had to figure out a way to manufacture lenses

00:07:37.653 --> 00:07:39.965
in paper itself at really high throughputs,

00:07:39.965 --> 00:07:41.824
so it uses a process of self-assembly

00:07:41.824 --> 00:07:42.936
and surface tension

00:07:42.936 --> 00:07:46.472
to build achromatic lenses in the paper itself.

00:07:46.472 --> 00:07:47.917
So that's where the lenses go.

00:07:47.917 --> 00:07:49.529
There are some light sources.

00:07:49.529 --> 00:07:50.914
And essentially, in the end,

00:07:50.914 --> 00:07:54.092
all the parts line up because of origami,

00:07:54.092 --> 00:07:57.363
because of the fact that origami allows us

00:07:57.363 --> 00:08:00.343
micron-scale precision of optical alignment.

00:08:00.343 --> 00:08:02.972
So even though this looks like a simple toy,

00:08:02.972 --> 00:08:04.886
the aspects of engineering that go in

00:08:04.886 --> 00:08:07.572
something like this are fairly sophisticated.

00:08:07.572 --> 00:08:10.807
So here is another obvious thing that we would do,

00:08:10.807 --> 00:08:12.400
typically, if I was going to show

00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:13.905
that these microscopes are robust,

00:08:13.905 --> 00:08:17.743
is go to the third floor and
drop it from the floor itself.

00:08:17.743 --> 00:08:21.066
There it is, and it survives.

00:08:21.066 --> 00:08:23.243
So for us, the next step actually

00:08:23.243 --> 00:08:25.082
is really finishing our field trials.

00:08:25.082 --> 00:08:27.187
We are starting at the end of the summer.

00:08:27.187 --> 00:08:30.114
We are at a stage where we'll be 
making thousands of microscopes.

00:08:30.114 --> 00:08:32.258
That would be the first time where we would be

00:08:32.258 --> 00:08:34.343
doing field trials with the highest density

00:08:34.343 --> 00:08:36.898
of microscopes ever at a given place.

00:08:36.898 --> 00:08:38.978
We've started collecting data for malaria,

00:08:38.978 --> 00:08:42.774
Chagas disease and giardia from patients themselves.

00:08:42.774 --> 00:08:44.868
And I want to leave you with this picture.

00:08:44.868 --> 00:08:46.793
I had not anticipated this before,

00:08:46.793 --> 00:08:48.480
but a really interesting link

00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:50.375
between hands-on science education

00:08:50.375 --> 00:08:51.633
and global health.

00:08:51.633 --> 00:08:54.559
What are the tools that we're actually providing

00:08:54.559 --> 00:08:56.739
the kids who are going to fight

00:08:56.739 --> 00:08:58.657
this monster soup for tomorrow?

00:08:58.657 --> 00:09:01.015
I would love for them to be able to just print out

00:09:01.015 --> 00:09:03.144
a Foldscope and carry them around in their pockets.
