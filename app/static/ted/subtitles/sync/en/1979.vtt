WEBVTT

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:15.271
Wow, this is bright.

00:00:15.271 --> 00:00:18.262
It must use a lot of power.

00:00:18.262 --> 00:00:19.754
Well, flying you all in here

00:00:19.754 --> 00:00:22.202
must have cost a bit of energy too.

00:00:22.202 --> 00:00:25.120
So the whole planet needs a lot of energy,

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:28.021
and so far we've been running mostly on fossil fuel.

00:00:28.021 --> 00:00:30.070
We've been burning gas.

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:31.457
It's been a good run.

00:00:31.457 --> 00:00:34.325
It got us to where we are, but we have to stop.

00:00:34.325 --> 00:00:36.479
We can't do that anymore.

00:00:36.479 --> 00:00:38.760
So we are trying different types of energy now,

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:39.974
alternative energy,

00:00:39.974 --> 00:00:42.472
but it proved quite difficult to find something

00:00:42.472 --> 00:00:45.273
that's as convenient and as cost-effective

00:00:45.273 --> 00:00:48.090
as oil, gas and coal.

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:52.180
My personal favorite is nuclear energy.

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:54.781
Now, it's very energy-dense,

00:00:54.781 --> 00:00:57.262
it produces solid, reliable power,

00:00:57.262 --> 00:00:59.645
and it doesn't make any CO2.

00:00:59.645 --> 00:01:01.137
Now we know of two ways

00:01:01.137 --> 00:01:06.311
of making nuclear energy: fission and fusion.

00:01:06.311 --> 00:01:08.656
Now in fission, you take a big nucleus,

00:01:08.656 --> 00:01:10.291
you break it in part, in two,

00:01:10.291 --> 00:01:11.838
and it makes lots of energy,

00:01:11.838 --> 00:01:14.051
and this is how the nuclear reactor today works.

00:01:14.051 --> 00:01:15.460
It works pretty good.

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:17.614
And then there's fusion.

00:01:17.614 --> 00:01:20.020
Now, I like fusion. Fusion's much better.

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:21.714
So you take two small nuclei,

00:01:21.714 --> 00:01:24.220
you put it together, and you make helium,

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:25.578
and that's very nice.

00:01:25.578 --> 00:01:27.124
It makes lots of energy.

00:01:27.124 --> 00:01:29.724
This is nature's way of producing energy.

00:01:29.724 --> 00:01:32.132
The sun and all the stars in the universe

00:01:32.132 --> 00:01:34.377
run on fusion.

00:01:34.377 --> 00:01:36.273
Now, a fusion plant

00:01:36.273 --> 00:01:38.588
would actually be quite cost-effective

00:01:38.588 --> 00:01:40.578
and it also would be quite safe.

00:01:40.578 --> 00:01:45.011
It only produces short term radioactive waste,

00:01:45.011 --> 00:01:47.043
and it cannot melt down.

00:01:47.043 --> 00:01:49.570
Now, the fuel from fusion comes from the ocean.

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:51.388
In the ocean, you can extract the fuel

00:01:51.388 --> 00:01:53.278
for about one thousandth of a cent

00:01:53.278 --> 00:01:55.609
per kilowatt-hour, so that's very, very cheap.

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:58.997
And if the whole planet would run on fusion,

00:01:58.997 --> 00:02:00.441
we could extract the fuel from the ocean.

00:02:00.441 --> 00:02:03.705
It would run for billions and billions of years.

00:02:03.705 --> 00:02:07.477
Now, if fusion is so great, why don't we have it?

00:02:07.477 --> 00:02:08.813
Where is it?

00:02:08.813 --> 00:02:10.661
Well, there's always a bit of a catch.

00:02:10.661 --> 00:02:13.899
Fusion is really, really hard to do.

00:02:13.899 --> 00:02:16.383
So the problem is, those two nuclei,

00:02:16.383 --> 00:02:18.011
they are both positively charged,

00:02:18.011 --> 00:02:19.802
so they don't want to fuse.

00:02:19.802 --> 00:02:21.579
They go like this. They go like that.

00:02:21.579 --> 00:02:22.543
So in order to make them fuse,

00:02:22.543 --> 00:02:24.730
you have to throw them at
each other with great speed,

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:25.643
and if they have enough speed,

00:02:25.643 --> 00:02:27.477
they will go against the repulsion,

00:02:27.477 --> 00:02:29.630
they will touch, and they will make energy.

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:32.037
Now, the particle speed

00:02:32.037 --> 00:02:33.807
is a measure of the temperature.

00:02:33.807 --> 00:02:35.549
So the temperature required for fusion

00:02:35.549 --> 00:02:38.711
is 150 billion degrees C.

00:02:38.711 --> 00:02:40.542
This is rather warm,

00:02:40.542 --> 00:02:43.988
and this is why fusion is so hard to do.

00:02:43.988 --> 00:02:46.013
Now, I caught my little fusion bug

00:02:46.013 --> 00:02:49.683
when I did my Ph.D. here at the
University of British Columbia,

00:02:49.683 --> 00:02:52.735
and then I got a big job in a laser printer place

00:02:52.735 --> 00:02:55.273
making printing for the printing industry.

00:02:55.273 --> 00:02:57.525
I worked there for 10 years,

00:02:57.525 --> 00:02:59.205
and I got a little bit bored,

00:02:59.205 --> 00:03:02.158
and then I was 40, and I got a mid-life crisis,

00:03:02.158 --> 00:03:03.791
you know, the usual thing:

00:03:03.791 --> 00:03:06.250
Who am I? What should I do?

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:08.836
What should I do? What can I do?

00:03:08.836 --> 00:03:10.888
And then I was looking at my good work,

00:03:10.888 --> 00:03:12.939
and what I was doing is I was cutting the forests

00:03:12.939 --> 00:03:14.294
around here in B.C.

00:03:14.294 --> 00:03:15.888
and burying you, all of you,

00:03:15.888 --> 00:03:19.330
in millions of tons of junk mail.

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:21.265
Now, that was not very satisfactory.

00:03:21.265 --> 00:03:23.530
So some people buy a Porsche.

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:26.301
Others get a mistress.

00:03:26.301 --> 00:03:27.975
But I've decided to get my bit

00:03:27.975 --> 00:03:32.238
to solve global warming and make fusion happen.

00:03:32.238 --> 00:03:33.969
Now, so the first thing I did

00:03:33.969 --> 00:03:36.398
is I looked into the literature and I see,

00:03:36.398 --> 00:03:39.140
how does fusion work?

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:42.282
So the physicists have been
working on fusion for a while,

00:03:42.282 --> 00:03:43.598
and one of the ways they do it

00:03:43.598 --> 00:03:45.904
is with something called a tokamak.

00:03:45.904 --> 00:03:48.634
It's a big ring of magnetic coil,

00:03:48.634 --> 00:03:49.960
superconducting coil,

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:51.310
and it makes a magnetic field

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:53.098
in a ring like this,

00:03:53.098 --> 00:03:54.490
and the hot gas in the middle,

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:56.620
which is called a plasma, is trapped.

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:58.368
The particles go round and round and round

00:03:58.368 --> 00:03:59.808
the circle at the wall.

00:03:59.808 --> 00:04:01.336
Then they throw a huge amount of heat in there

00:04:01.336 --> 00:04:03.810
to try to cook that to fusion temperature.

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:06.138
So this is the inside of one of those donuts,

00:04:06.138 --> 00:04:07.470
and on the right side you can see

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:09.610
the fusion plasma in there.

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:11.858
Now, a second way of doing this

00:04:11.858 --> 00:04:14.258
is by using laser fusion.

00:04:14.258 --> 00:04:16.378
Now in laser fusion, you have a little ping pong ball,

00:04:16.378 --> 00:04:18.424
you put the fusion fuel in the center,

00:04:18.424 --> 00:04:21.354
and you zap that with a whole
bunch of laser around it.

00:04:21.354 --> 00:04:23.058
The lasers are very strong, and it squashes

00:04:23.058 --> 00:04:24.784
the ping pong ball really, really quick.

00:04:24.784 --> 00:04:26.739
And if you squeeze something hard enough,

00:04:26.739 --> 00:04:28.114
it gets hotter,

00:04:28.114 --> 00:04:29.510
and if it gets really, really fast,

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:31.828
and they do that in one billionth of a second,

00:04:31.828 --> 00:04:33.731
it makes enough energy and enough heat

00:04:33.731 --> 00:04:35.067
to make fusion.

00:04:35.067 --> 00:04:37.144
So this is the inside of one such machine.

00:04:37.144 --> 00:04:38.987
You see the laser beam and the pellet

00:04:38.987 --> 00:04:40.536
in the center.

00:04:40.536 --> 00:04:43.498
Now, most people think that fusion is going nowhere.

00:04:43.498 --> 00:04:46.430
They always think that the physicists are in their lab

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:48.245
and they're working hard, but nothing is happening.

00:04:48.245 --> 00:04:49.765
That's actually not quite true.

00:04:49.765 --> 00:04:51.757
This is a curve of the gain in fusion

00:04:51.757 --> 00:04:53.949
over the last 30 years or so,

00:04:53.949 --> 00:04:55.507
and you can see that we're making now

00:04:55.507 --> 00:04:58.340
about 10,000 times more fusion than we used to

00:04:58.340 --> 00:04:59.414
when we started.

00:04:59.414 --> 00:05:00.409
That's a pretty good gain.

00:05:00.409 --> 00:05:02.395
As a matter of fact, it's as fast

00:05:02.395 --> 00:05:04.095
as the fabled Moore's Law

00:05:04.095 --> 00:05:06.299
that defined the amount of transistors

00:05:06.299 --> 00:05:07.816
they can put on a chip.

00:05:07.816 --> 00:05:10.821
Now, this dot here is called JET,

00:05:10.821 --> 00:05:12.244
the Joint European Torus.

00:05:12.244 --> 00:05:14.674
It's a big tokamak donut in Europe,

00:05:14.674 --> 00:05:17.744
and this machine in 1997

00:05:17.744 --> 00:05:20.968
produced 16 megawatts of fusion power

00:05:20.968 --> 00:05:23.126
with 17 megawatts of heat.

00:05:23.126 --> 00:05:24.931
Now, you say, that's not much use,

00:05:24.931 --> 00:05:26.642
but it's actually pretty close,

00:05:26.642 --> 00:05:27.682
considering we can get

00:05:27.682 --> 00:05:29.989
about 10,000 times more than we started.

00:05:29.989 --> 00:05:32.602
The second dot here is the NIF.

00:05:32.602 --> 00:05:34.888
It's the National Ignition Facility.

00:05:34.888 --> 00:05:37.414
It's a big laser machine in the U.S.,

00:05:37.414 --> 00:05:38.691
and last month they announced

00:05:38.691 --> 00:05:40.544
with quite a bit of noise

00:05:40.544 --> 00:05:42.702
that they had managed to make more fusion energy

00:05:42.702 --> 00:05:44.292
from the fusion

00:05:44.292 --> 00:05:47.148
than the energy that they put in 
the center of the ping pong ball.

00:05:47.148 --> 00:05:48.973
Now, that's not quite good enough,

00:05:48.973 --> 00:05:50.673
because the laser to put that energy in

00:05:50.673 --> 00:05:52.405
was more energy than that,

00:05:52.405 --> 00:05:54.445
but it was pretty good.

00:05:54.445 --> 00:05:56.172
Now this is ITER,

00:05:56.172 --> 00:05:58.230
pronounced in French: EE-tairh.

00:05:58.230 --> 00:06:01.361
So this is a big collaboration of different countries

00:06:01.361 --> 00:06:03.216
that are building a huge magnetic donut

00:06:03.216 --> 00:06:05.160
in the south of France,

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:07.168
and this machine, when it's finished,

00:06:07.168 --> 00:06:09.946
will produce 500 megawatts of fusion power

00:06:09.946 --> 00:06:12.346
with only 50 megawatts to make it.

00:06:12.346 --> 00:06:13.532
So this one is the real one.

00:06:13.532 --> 00:06:14.264
It's going to work.

00:06:14.264 --> 00:06:16.456
That's the kind of machine that makes energy.

00:06:16.456 --> 00:06:18.212
Now if you look at the graph, you will notice

00:06:18.212 --> 00:06:19.717
that those two dots are a little bit

00:06:19.717 --> 00:06:20.759
on the right of the curve.

00:06:20.759 --> 00:06:22.695
We kind of have fallen off the progress.

00:06:22.695 --> 00:06:24.684
Actually, the science to make those machines

00:06:24.684 --> 00:06:26.220
was really in time

00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:29.056
to produce fusion during that curve.

00:06:29.056 --> 00:06:31.795
However, there has been a bit of politics going on,

00:06:31.795 --> 00:06:33.927
and the will to do it was not there,

00:06:33.927 --> 00:06:35.605
so it drifted to the right.

00:06:35.605 --> 00:06:37.661
ITER, for example, could have been built

00:06:37.661 --> 00:06:39.512
in 2000 or 2005,

00:06:39.512 --> 00:06:41.957
but because it's a big international collaboration,

00:06:41.957 --> 00:06:44.405
the politics got in and it delayed it a bit.

00:06:44.405 --> 00:06:46.029
For example, it took them about three years

00:06:46.029 --> 00:06:47.597
to decide where to put it.

00:06:47.597 --> 00:06:50.133
Now, fusion is often criticized

00:06:50.133 --> 00:06:51.733
for being a little too expensive.

00:06:51.733 --> 00:06:53.274
Yes, it did cost

00:06:53.274 --> 00:06:55.310
a billion dollars or two billion dollars a year

00:06:55.310 --> 00:06:56.503
to make this progress.

00:06:56.503 --> 00:06:58.093
But you have to compare that to the cost

00:06:58.093 --> 00:06:59.333
of making Moore's Law.

00:06:59.333 --> 00:07:01.221
That cost way more than that.

00:07:01.221 --> 00:07:02.739
The result of Moore's Law

00:07:02.739 --> 00:07:04.675
is this cell phone here in my pocket.

00:07:04.675 --> 00:07:06.904
This cell phone, and the Internet behind it,

00:07:06.904 --> 00:07:09.584
cost about one trillion dollars,

00:07:09.584 --> 00:07:12.815
just so I can take a selfie

00:07:12.815 --> 00:07:15.389
and put it on Facebook.

00:07:15.389 --> 00:07:16.890
Then when my dad sees that,

00:07:16.890 --> 00:07:20.070
he'll be very proud.

00:07:20.070 --> 00:07:23.978
We also spend about 650 billion dollars a year

00:07:23.978 --> 00:07:26.280
in subsidies for oil and gas

00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:27.910
and renewable energy.

00:07:27.910 --> 00:07:32.084
Now, we spend one half of a percent of that on fusion.

00:07:32.084 --> 00:07:34.732
So me, personally, I don't think it's too expensive.

00:07:34.732 --> 00:07:36.512
I think it's actually been shortchanged,

00:07:36.512 --> 00:07:38.904
considering it can solve all our energy problems

00:07:38.904 --> 00:07:41.578
cleanly for the next couple of billions of years.

00:07:41.578 --> 00:07:44.238
Now I can say that, but I'm a little bit biased,

00:07:44.238 --> 00:07:46.126
because I started a fusion company

00:07:46.126 --> 00:07:48.684
and I don't even have a Facebook account.

00:07:48.684 --> 00:07:54.067
So when I started this fusion company in 2002,

00:07:54.067 --> 00:07:56.909
I knew I couldn't fight with the big lads.

00:07:56.909 --> 00:07:58.486
They had much more resources than me.

00:07:58.486 --> 00:08:00.726
So I decided I would need to find a solution

00:08:00.726 --> 00:08:02.613
that is cheaper and faster.

00:08:02.613 --> 00:08:04.523
Now magnetic and laser fusion

00:08:04.523 --> 00:08:05.954
are pretty good machines.

00:08:05.954 --> 00:08:07.395
They are awesome pieces of technology,

00:08:07.395 --> 00:08:09.269
wonderful machines, and they have shown

00:08:09.269 --> 00:08:10.748
that fusion can be done.

00:08:10.748 --> 00:08:12.702
However, as a power plant,

00:08:12.702 --> 00:08:14.573
I don't think they're very good.

00:08:14.573 --> 00:08:16.630
They're way too big, way too complicated,

00:08:16.630 --> 00:08:17.768
way too expensive,

00:08:17.768 --> 00:08:19.524
and also, they don't deal very much

00:08:19.524 --> 00:08:20.798
with the fusion energy.

00:08:20.798 --> 00:08:22.556
When you make fusion, the energy comes out

00:08:22.556 --> 00:08:25.224
as neutrons, fast neutrons comes out of the plasma.

00:08:25.224 --> 00:08:27.484
Those neutrons hit the wall of the machine.

00:08:27.484 --> 00:08:28.869
It damages it.

00:08:28.869 --> 00:08:30.833
And also, you have to catch
the heat from those neutrons

00:08:30.833 --> 00:08:33.266
and run some steam to spin a turbine somewhere,

00:08:33.266 --> 00:08:34.550
and on those machines,

00:08:34.550 --> 00:08:37.181
it was all a bit of an afterthought.

00:08:37.181 --> 00:08:40.332
So I decided that surely there
is a better way of doing that.

00:08:40.332 --> 00:08:41.616
So back to the literature,

00:08:41.616 --> 00:08:43.608
and I read about the fusion everywhere.

00:08:43.608 --> 00:08:46.330
One way in particular attracted my attention,

00:08:46.330 --> 00:08:48.420
and it's called magnetized target fusion,

00:08:48.420 --> 00:08:51.008
or MTF for short.

00:08:51.008 --> 00:08:53.450
Now, in MTF, what you want to do

00:08:53.450 --> 00:08:55.420
is you take a big vat

00:08:55.420 --> 00:08:57.436
and you fill that with liquid metal,

00:08:57.436 --> 00:08:58.956
and you spin the liquid metal

00:08:58.956 --> 00:09:00.604
to open a vortex in the center,

00:09:00.604 --> 00:09:01.740
a bit like your sink.

00:09:01.740 --> 00:09:03.844
When you pull the plug on a sink, it makes a vortex.

00:09:03.844 --> 00:09:06.240
And then you have some pistons driven by pressure

00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:07.716
that goes on the outside,

00:09:07.716 --> 00:09:09.636
and this compresses the liquid metal

00:09:09.636 --> 00:09:11.398
around the plasma, and it compresses it,

00:09:11.398 --> 00:09:13.052
it gets hotter, like a laser,

00:09:13.052 --> 00:09:14.278
and then it makes fusion.

00:09:14.278 --> 00:09:15.198
So it's a bit of a mix

00:09:15.198 --> 00:09:16.853
between a magnetized fusion

00:09:16.853 --> 00:09:18.836
and the laser fusion.

00:09:18.836 --> 00:09:21.609
So those have a couple of very good advantages.

00:09:21.609 --> 00:09:23.952
The liquid metal absorbs all the neutrons

00:09:23.952 --> 00:09:25.708
and no neutrons hit the wall,

00:09:25.708 --> 00:09:27.844
and therefore there's no damage to the machine.

00:09:27.844 --> 00:09:29.300
The liquid metal gets hot,

00:09:29.300 --> 00:09:31.300
so you can pump that in a heat exchanger,

00:09:31.300 --> 00:09:33.180
make some steam, spin a turbine.

00:09:33.180 --> 00:09:34.359
So that's a very convenient way of doing

00:09:34.359 --> 00:09:35.619
this part of the process.

00:09:35.619 --> 00:09:39.210
And finally, all the energy to make the fusion happen

00:09:39.210 --> 00:09:41.345
comes from steam-powered pistons,

00:09:41.345 --> 00:09:43.001
which is way cheaper than lasers

00:09:43.001 --> 00:09:44.895
or superconducting coils.

00:09:44.895 --> 00:09:46.383
Now, this was all very good

00:09:46.383 --> 00:09:48.887
except for the problem that it didn't quite work.

00:09:48.887 --> 00:09:50.757
(Laughter)

00:09:50.757 --> 00:09:52.053
There's always a catch.

00:09:52.053 --> 00:09:53.567
So when you compress that,

00:09:53.567 --> 00:09:55.491
the plasma cools down

00:09:55.491 --> 00:09:57.119
faster than the compression speed,

00:09:57.119 --> 00:09:58.432
so you're trying to compress it,

00:09:58.432 --> 00:10:00.767
but the plasma cooled down and
cooled down and cooled down

00:10:00.767 --> 00:10:02.708
and then it did absolutely nothing.

00:10:02.708 --> 00:10:04.743
So when I saw that, I said,
well, this is such a shame,

00:10:04.743 --> 00:10:06.493
because it's a very, very good idea.

00:10:06.493 --> 00:10:08.847
So hopefully I can improve on that.

00:10:08.847 --> 00:10:09.942
So I thought about it for a minute,

00:10:09.942 --> 00:10:12.019
and I said, okay, how can we make that work better?

00:10:12.019 --> 00:10:13.877
So then I thought about impact.

00:10:13.877 --> 00:10:15.711
What about if we use a big hammer

00:10:15.711 --> 00:10:18.243
and we swing it and we hit the nail like this,

00:10:18.243 --> 00:10:20.217
in the place of putting the hammer on the nail

00:10:20.217 --> 00:10:22.412
and pushing and try to put it in? That won't work.

00:10:22.412 --> 00:10:24.343
So what the idea is

00:10:24.343 --> 00:10:26.087
is to use the idea of an impact.

00:10:26.087 --> 00:10:28.169
So we accelerate the pistons with steam,

00:10:28.169 --> 00:10:29.448
that takes a little bit of time,

00:10:29.448 --> 00:10:31.431
but then, bang! you hit the piston,

00:10:31.431 --> 00:10:33.983
and, baff!, all the energy is done instantly,

00:10:33.983 --> 00:10:35.579
down instantly to the liquid,

00:10:35.579 --> 00:10:37.629
and that compresses the plasma much faster.

00:10:37.629 --> 00:10:40.077
So I decided, okay, this is good, let's make that.

00:10:40.077 --> 00:10:43.802
So we built this machine in this garage here.

00:10:43.802 --> 00:10:44.887
We made a small machine

00:10:44.887 --> 00:10:46.859
that we managed to squeeze

00:10:46.859 --> 00:10:48.507
a little bit of neutrons out of that,

00:10:48.507 --> 00:10:50.708
and those are my marketing neutrons,

00:10:50.708 --> 00:10:52.151
and with those marketing neutrons,

00:10:52.151 --> 00:10:54.750
then I raised about 50 million dollars,

00:10:54.750 --> 00:10:57.640
and I hired 65 people. That's my team here.

00:10:57.640 --> 00:10:59.222
And this is what we want to build.

00:10:59.222 --> 00:11:00.736
So it's going to be a big machine,

00:11:00.736 --> 00:11:02.210
about three meters in diameter,

00:11:02.210 --> 00:11:04.012
liquid lead spinning around,

00:11:04.012 --> 00:11:05.604
big vortex in the center,

00:11:05.604 --> 00:11:07.924
put the plasma on the top and on the bottom,

00:11:07.924 --> 00:11:09.350
piston hits on the side,

00:11:09.350 --> 00:11:10.860
bang!, it compresses it,

00:11:10.860 --> 00:11:12.144
and it will make some energy,

00:11:12.144 --> 00:11:14.536
and the neutron will come out in the liquid metal,

00:11:14.536 --> 00:11:17.136
going to go in a steam engine and make the turbine,

00:11:17.136 --> 00:11:18.642
and some of the steam will go back

00:11:18.642 --> 00:11:19.640
to fire the piston.

00:11:19.640 --> 00:11:21.530
We're going to run that about one time per second,

00:11:21.530 --> 00:11:26.914
and it will produce 100 megawatts of electricity.

00:11:26.914 --> 00:11:28.599
Okay, we also built this injector,

00:11:28.599 --> 00:11:30.886
so this injector makes the plasma to start with.

00:11:30.886 --> 00:11:32.601
It makes the plasma at about

00:11:32.601 --> 00:11:36.576
a lukewarm temperature of three million degrees C.

00:11:36.576 --> 00:11:38.783
Unfortunately, it doesn't last quite long enough,

00:11:38.783 --> 00:11:41.918
so we need to extend the life
of the plasma a little bit,

00:11:41.918 --> 00:11:43.550
but last month it got a lot better,

00:11:43.550 --> 00:11:46.135
so I think we have the plasma compressing now.

00:11:46.135 --> 00:11:48.691
Then we built a small sphere, about this big,

00:11:48.691 --> 00:11:50.157
14 pistons around it,

00:11:50.157 --> 00:11:52.481
and this will compress the liquid.

00:11:52.481 --> 00:11:54.586
However, plasma is difficult to compress.

00:11:54.586 --> 00:11:55.375
When you compress it,

00:11:55.375 --> 00:11:57.927
it tends to go a little bit crooked like that,

00:11:57.927 --> 00:11:59.535
so you need the timing of the piston

00:11:59.535 --> 00:12:00.631
to be very good,

00:12:00.631 --> 00:12:03.303
and for that we use several control systems,

00:12:03.303 --> 00:12:05.505
which was not possible in 1970,

00:12:05.505 --> 00:12:06.897
but we now can do that

00:12:06.897 --> 00:12:10.189
with nice, new electronics.

00:12:10.189 --> 00:12:12.718
So finally, most people think that fusion

00:12:12.718 --> 00:12:14.870
is in the future and will never happen,

00:12:14.870 --> 00:12:17.964
but as a matter of fact, fusion is getting very close.

00:12:17.964 --> 00:12:19.040
We are almost there.

00:12:19.040 --> 00:12:21.677
The big labs have shown that fusion is doable,

00:12:21.677 --> 00:12:23.984
and now there are small companies
that are thinking about that,

00:12:23.984 --> 00:12:26.345
and they say, it's not that it cannot be done,

00:12:26.345 --> 00:12:28.450
but it's how to make it cost-effectively.

00:12:28.450 --> 00:12:30.603
General Fusion is one of those small companies,

00:12:30.603 --> 00:12:33.921
and hopefully, very soon, somebody, someone,

00:12:33.921 --> 00:12:35.204
will crack that nut,

00:12:35.204 --> 00:12:36.778
and perhaps it will be General Fusion.

00:12:36.778 --> 00:12:38.557
Thank you very much.

00:12:38.557 --> 00:12:42.737
(Applause)
