00:00:12.871 --> 00:00:15.538
A computer is an incredibly powerful means

00:00:15.538 --> 00:00:17.192
of creative expression,

00:00:17.192 --> 00:00:18.763
but for the most part,

00:00:18.763 --> 00:00:20.928
that expression is confined to the screens

00:00:20.928 --> 00:00:23.346
of our laptops and mobile phones.

00:00:23.346 --> 00:00:25.546
And I'd like to tell you a story about

00:00:25.546 --> 00:00:27.502
bringing this power of the computer

00:00:27.502 --> 00:00:29.872
to move things around and interact with us

00:00:29.872 --> 00:00:32.785
off of the screen and into the physical world

00:00:32.785 --> 00:00:33.974
in which we live.

00:00:33.974 --> 00:00:35.592
A few years ago, I got a call from

00:00:35.592 --> 00:00:38.078
a luxury fashion store called Barneys New York,

00:00:38.078 --> 00:00:39.342
and the next thing I knew,

00:00:39.342 --> 00:00:42.035
I was designing storefront kinetic sculptures

00:00:42.035 --> 00:00:43.427
for their window displays.

00:00:43.427 --> 00:00:44.822
This one's called "The Chase."

00:00:44.822 --> 00:00:46.168
There are two pairs of shoes,

00:00:46.168 --> 00:00:47.793
a man's pair and a woman's pair,

00:00:47.793 --> 00:00:50.697
and they play out this slow, tense chase

00:00:50.697 --> 00:00:51.975
around the window

00:00:51.975 --> 00:00:54.200
in which the man scoots up behind the woman

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:55.773
and gets in her personal space,

00:00:55.773 --> 00:00:57.708
and then she moves away.

00:00:57.708 --> 00:00:59.549
Each of the shoes has magnets in it,

00:00:59.549 --> 00:01:01.552
and there are magnets underneath the table

00:01:01.552 --> 00:01:03.516
that move the shoes around.

00:01:03.516 --> 00:01:05.548
My friend Andy Cavatorta was building

00:01:05.548 --> 00:01:09.090
a robotic harp for Bjork's Biophilia tour

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.482
and I wound up building the electronics

00:01:11.482 --> 00:01:13.671
and motion control software

00:01:13.671 --> 00:01:16.137
to make the harps move and play music.

00:01:16.137 --> 00:01:18.148
The harp has four separate pendulums,

00:01:18.148 --> 00:01:20.274
and each pendulum has 11 strings,

00:01:20.274 --> 00:01:22.762
so the harp swings on its axis and also rotates

00:01:22.762 --> 00:01:24.965
in order to play different musical notes,

00:01:24.965 --> 00:01:27.127
and the harps are all networked together

00:01:27.127 --> 00:01:28.927
so that they can play the right notes

00:01:28.927 --> 00:01:31.553
at the right time in the music.

00:01:31.553 --> 00:01:33.977
I built an interactive chemistry exhibit

00:01:33.977 --> 00:01:36.576
at the Museum of Science and Industry in Chicago,

00:01:36.576 --> 00:01:39.557
and this exhibit lets people use physical objects

00:01:39.557 --> 00:01:42.593
to grab chemical elements off of the periodic table

00:01:42.593 --> 00:01:44.001
and bring them together to cause

00:01:44.001 --> 00:01:45.767
chemical reactions to happen.

00:01:45.767 --> 00:01:47.691
And the museum noticed that people

00:01:47.691 --> 00:01:49.917
were spending a lot of time with this exhibit,

00:01:49.917 --> 00:01:53.064
and a researcher from a science education center

00:01:53.064 --> 00:01:55.869
in Australia decided to study this exhibit

00:01:55.869 --> 00:01:58.109
and try to figure out what was going on.

00:01:58.109 --> 00:02:00.402
And she found that the physical objects

00:02:00.402 --> 00:02:02.066
that people were using were helping people

00:02:02.066 --> 00:02:04.080
understand how to use the exhibit,

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:07.023
and were helping people learn in a social way.

00:02:07.023 --> 00:02:09.289
And when you think about
it, this makes a lot of sense,

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:11.529
that using specialized physical objects

00:02:11.529 --> 00:02:14.801
would help people use an interface more easily.

00:02:14.801 --> 00:02:17.640
I mean, our hands and our minds are optimized

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:20.909
to think about and interact with tangible objects.

00:02:20.909 --> 00:02:22.971
Think about which you find easier to use,

00:02:22.971 --> 00:02:25.290
a physical keyboard or an onscreen keyboard

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:27.390
like on a phone?

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:28.415
But the thing that struck me

00:02:28.415 --> 00:02:30.414
about all of these different projects

00:02:30.414 --> 00:02:33.531
is that they really had to be built from scratch,

00:02:33.531 --> 00:02:35.321
down to the level of the electronics

00:02:35.321 --> 00:02:36.427
and the printed circuit boards and

00:02:36.427 --> 00:02:39.172
all the mechanisms all the way up to the software.

00:02:39.172 --> 00:02:40.934
I wanted to create something

00:02:40.934 --> 00:02:44.253
where we could move objects
under computer control

00:02:44.253 --> 00:02:46.502
and create interactions around that idea

00:02:46.502 --> 00:02:48.717
without having to go through this process

00:02:48.717 --> 00:02:50.100
of building something from scratch

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:51.475
every single time.

00:02:51.475 --> 00:02:53.466
So my first attempt at this

00:02:53.466 --> 00:02:55.150
was at the MIT Media Lab

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:56.731
with Professor Hiroshi Ishii,

00:02:56.731 --> 00:02:58.566
and we built this array of

00:02:58.566 --> 00:03:00.823
512 different electromagnets,

00:03:00.823 --> 00:03:03.450
and together they were able to move objects around

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:04.986
on top of their surface.

00:03:04.986 --> 00:03:06.534
But the problem with this

00:03:06.534 --> 00:03:08.190
was that these magnets

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:10.350
cost over 10,000 dollars.

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:12.016
Although each one was pretty small,

00:03:12.016 --> 00:03:13.725
altogether they weighed so much

00:03:13.725 --> 00:03:14.980
that the table that they were on

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:16.538
started to sag.

00:03:16.538 --> 00:03:17.870
So I wanted to build something

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:19.486
where you could have this kind of interaction

00:03:19.486 --> 00:03:22.129
on any tabletop surface.

00:03:22.129 --> 00:03:24.210
So to explore this idea,

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:26.360
I built an army of small robots,

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:29.125
and each of these robots has
what are called omni wheels.

00:03:29.125 --> 00:03:30.430
They're these special wheels

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:33.096
that can move equally easily in all directions,

00:03:33.096 --> 00:03:35.685
and when you couple these robots

00:03:35.685 --> 00:03:37.595
with a video projector,

00:03:37.595 --> 00:03:39.403
you have these physical tools

00:03:39.403 --> 00:03:42.303
for interacting with digital information.

00:03:42.303 --> 00:03:44.145
So here's an example of what I mean.

00:03:44.145 --> 00:03:46.067
This is a video editing application

00:03:46.067 --> 00:03:47.553
where all of the controls

00:03:47.553 --> 00:03:49.860
for manipulating the video are physical.

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:51.442
So if we want to tweak the color,

00:03:51.442 --> 00:03:52.794
we just enter the color mode,

00:03:52.794 --> 00:03:54.090
and then we get three different dials

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:55.468
for tweaking the color,

00:03:55.468 --> 00:03:57.429
or if we want to adjust the audio,

00:03:57.429 --> 00:04:00.770
then we get two different dials
for that, these physical objects.

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:03.616
So here the left and right channel stay in sync,

00:04:03.616 --> 00:04:05.359
but if we want to, we can override that

00:04:05.359 --> 00:04:08.358
by grabbing both of them at the same time.

00:04:08.358 --> 00:04:10.286
So the idea is that we get the speed

00:04:10.286 --> 00:04:13.403
and efficiency benefits of using these physical dials

00:04:13.403 --> 00:04:16.193
together with the flexibility and versatility

00:04:16.193 --> 00:04:19.524
of a system that's designed in software.

00:04:19.524 --> 00:04:21.459
And this is a mapping application

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:23.586
for disaster response.

00:04:23.586 --> 00:04:25.531
So you have these physical objects

00:04:25.531 --> 00:04:27.758
that represent police, fire and rescue,

00:04:27.758 --> 00:04:29.311
and a dispatcher can grab them

00:04:29.311 --> 00:04:30.637
and place them on the map

00:04:30.637 --> 00:04:32.626
to tell those units where to go,

00:04:32.626 --> 00:04:35.002
and then the position of the units on the map

00:04:35.002 --> 00:04:36.971
gets synced up with the position

00:04:36.971 --> 00:04:40.598
of those units in the real world.

00:04:40.598 --> 00:04:42.210
This is a video chat application.

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:44.562
It's amazing how much emotion you can convey

00:04:44.562 --> 00:04:45.775
with just a few simple movements

00:04:45.775 --> 00:04:48.200
of a physical object.

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:51.252
With this interface, we open up
a huge array of possibilities

00:04:51.252 --> 00:04:53.330
in between traditional board games

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:54.744
and arcade games,

00:04:54.744 --> 00:04:57.291
where the physical possibilities of interaction

00:04:57.291 --> 00:05:01.004
make so many different styles of play possible.

00:05:01.004 --> 00:05:03.393
But one of the areas that I'm most excited

00:05:03.393 --> 00:05:05.207
about using this platform for

00:05:05.207 --> 00:05:07.750
is applying it to problems that are difficult

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:10.004
for computers or people to solve alone.

00:05:10.004 --> 00:05:12.626
One example of those is protein folding.

00:05:12.626 --> 00:05:14.038
So here we have an interface

00:05:14.038 --> 00:05:17.552
where we have physical handles onto a protein,

00:05:17.552 --> 00:05:19.303
and we can grab those handles

00:05:19.303 --> 00:05:22.290
and try to move the protein and
try to fold it in different ways.

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:25.290
And if we move it in a way that
doesn't really make sense

00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:27.257
with the underlying molecular simulation,

00:05:27.257 --> 00:05:29.459
we get this physical feedback where we can

00:05:29.459 --> 00:05:31.432
actually feel these physical handles

00:05:31.432 --> 00:05:33.040
pulling back against us.

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:34.571
So feeling what's going on

00:05:34.571 --> 00:05:36.810
inside a molecular simulation

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:39.756
is a whole different level of interaction.

00:05:39.756 --> 00:05:42.737
So we're just beginning to explore

00:05:42.737 --> 00:05:45.248
what's possible when we use software

00:05:45.248 --> 00:05:46.739
to control the movement

00:05:46.739 --> 00:05:48.982
of objects in our environment.

00:05:48.982 --> 00:05:51.886
Maybe this is the computer of the future.

00:05:51.886 --> 00:05:53.502
There's no touchscreen.

00:05:53.502 --> 00:05:55.533
There's no technology visible at all.

00:05:55.533 --> 00:05:57.377
But when we want to have a video chat

00:05:57.377 --> 00:05:58.838
or play a game

00:05:58.838 --> 00:06:01.551
or lay out the slides to our next TED Talk,

00:06:01.551 --> 00:06:03.824
the objects on the table come alive.

00:06:03.824 --> 00:06:05.176
Thank you.

00:06:05.176 --> 00:06:07.299
(Applause)
