00:00:13.692 --> 00:00:16.536
There are 39 million people in the world

00:00:16.536 --> 00:00:18.026
who are blind.

00:00:18.026 --> 00:00:20.500
Eighty percent of them

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:23.319
are living in low-income countries such as Kenya,

00:00:23.319 --> 00:00:25.268
and the absolute majority

00:00:25.268 --> 00:00:26.775
do not need to be blind.

00:00:26.775 --> 00:00:28.630
They are blind from diseases

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:32.406
that are either completely curable or preventable.

00:00:32.406 --> 00:00:34.918
Knowing this, with my young family,

00:00:34.918 --> 00:00:36.312
we moved to Kenya.

00:00:36.312 --> 00:00:38.119
We secured equipment,

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:41.818
funds, vehicles, we trained a team,

00:00:41.818 --> 00:00:43.842
we set up a hundred clinics throughout

00:00:43.842 --> 00:00:45.340
the Great Rift Valley

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:48.801
to try and understand a single question:

00:00:48.801 --> 00:00:50.887
why are people going blind,

00:00:50.887 --> 00:00:53.806
and what can we do?

00:00:53.806 --> 00:00:56.720
The challenges were great.

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:58.551
When we got to where we were going,

00:00:58.551 --> 00:01:01.217
we set up our high-tech equipment.

00:01:01.217 --> 00:01:03.396
Power was rarely available.

00:01:03.396 --> 00:01:04.249
We'd have to run our equipment

00:01:04.249 --> 00:01:07.149
from petrol power generators.

00:01:07.149 --> 00:01:09.096
And then something occurred to me:

00:01:09.096 --> 00:01:11.591
There has to be an easier way,

00:01:11.591 --> 00:01:13.591
because it's the patients who are the most in need

00:01:13.591 --> 00:01:15.149
of access to eye care

00:01:15.149 --> 00:01:17.490
who are the least likely to get it.

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:18.596
More people in Kenya,

00:01:18.596 --> 00:01:20.508
and in sub-Saharan Africa,

00:01:20.508 --> 00:01:22.299
have access to a mobile phone

00:01:22.299 --> 00:01:24.452
than they do clean running water.

00:01:24.452 --> 00:01:26.171
So we said, could we harness

00:01:26.171 --> 00:01:27.790
the power of mobile technology

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:29.941
to deliver eye care in a new way?

00:01:29.941 --> 00:01:31.726
And so we developed Peek,

00:01:31.726 --> 00:01:34.264
a smartphone [system] that enables

00:01:34.264 --> 00:01:35.776
community healthcare workers

00:01:35.776 --> 00:01:39.606
and empowers them to deliver eye care everywhere.

00:01:39.606 --> 00:01:42.276
We set about replacing
traditional hospital equipment,

00:01:42.276 --> 00:01:44.799
which is bulky, expensive and fragile,

00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:46.834
with smartphone apps and hardware

00:01:46.834 --> 00:01:48.971
that make it possible to test anyone

00:01:48.971 --> 00:01:52.160
in any language and of any age.

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:53.964
Here we have a demonstration

00:01:53.964 --> 00:01:55.687
of a three-month-old having their vision

00:01:55.687 --> 00:02:00.060
accurately tested using an app and an eye tracker.

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:05.543
We've got many trials going on

00:02:05.543 --> 00:02:07.743
in the community and in schools,

00:02:07.743 --> 00:02:09.643
and through the lessons that
we've learned in the field,

00:02:09.643 --> 00:02:11.346
we've realized it's extremely important

00:02:11.346 --> 00:02:14.206
to share the data in non-medical jargon

00:02:14.206 --> 00:02:15.867
so that people understand

00:02:15.867 --> 00:02:18.490
what we're examining and what that means to them.

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:19.764
So here, for example,

00:02:19.764 --> 00:02:21.620
we use our sight sim application,

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:23.412
once your vision has been measured,

00:02:23.412 --> 00:02:26.122
to show carers and teachers

00:02:26.122 --> 00:02:28.636
what the visual world is like for that person,

00:02:28.636 --> 00:02:32.102
so they can empathize with them and help them.

00:02:32.102 --> 00:02:34.490
Once we've discovered somebody has low vision,

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:37.061
the next big challenge is to work out why,

00:02:37.061 --> 00:02:38.178
and to be able to do that,

00:02:38.178 --> 00:02:40.679
we need to have access to the inside of the eye.

00:02:40.679 --> 00:02:43.265
Traditionally, this requires expensive equipment

00:02:43.265 --> 00:02:45.346
to examine an area called the retina.

00:02:45.346 --> 00:02:48.155
The retina is the single part of the eye that has

00:02:48.155 --> 00:02:50.251
huge amounts of information about the body

00:02:50.251 --> 00:02:52.039
and its health.

00:02:52.039 --> 00:02:53.850
We've developed 3D-printed,

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:55.291
low-cost hardware

00:02:55.291 --> 00:02:57.691
that comes in at less than five dollars to produce,

00:02:57.691 --> 00:03:00.634
which can then be clipped onto a smartphone

00:03:00.634 --> 00:03:02.076
and makes it possible to get views

00:03:02.076 --> 00:03:03.297
of the back of the eye

00:03:03.297 --> 00:03:05.053
of a very high quality.

00:03:05.053 --> 00:03:08.250
And the beauty is, anybody can do it.

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:11.129
In our trials on over two and half thousand people,

00:03:11.129 --> 00:03:13.046
the smartphone with the add-on clip

00:03:13.046 --> 00:03:14.727
is comparable to a camera

00:03:14.727 --> 00:03:16.622
that is hugely more expensive

00:03:16.622 --> 00:03:20.211
and hugely more difficult to transport.

00:03:20.211 --> 00:03:22.090
When we first moved to Kenya,

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:24.743
we went with 150,000 dollars of equipment,

00:03:24.743 --> 00:03:27.200
a team of 15 people,

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:30.092
and that was what was
needed to deliver health care.

00:03:30.092 --> 00:03:32.457
Now, all that's needed

00:03:32.457 --> 00:03:34.249
is a single person

00:03:34.249 --> 00:03:37.645
on a bike with a smartphone.

00:03:37.645 --> 00:03:41.499
And it costs just 500 dollars.

00:03:41.499 --> 00:03:43.369
The issue of power supply

00:03:43.369 --> 00:03:45.930
is overcome by harnessing the power of solar.

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:47.070
Our healthcare workers travel

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:48.615
with a solar-powered rucksack

00:03:48.615 --> 00:03:51.076
which keeps the phone charged and backed up.

00:03:51.076 --> 00:03:53.346
Now we go to the patient

00:03:53.346 --> 00:03:56.057
rather than waiting for the patient never to come.

00:03:56.057 --> 00:03:57.790
We go to them in their homes

00:03:57.790 --> 00:03:59.587
and we give them the most comprehensive,

00:03:59.587 --> 00:04:01.527
high-tech, accurate examination,

00:04:01.527 --> 00:04:05.631
which can be delivered by
anyone with minimal training.

00:04:05.631 --> 00:04:08.468
We can link global experts

00:04:08.468 --> 00:04:10.210
with people in the most rural,

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:11.400
difficult-to-reach places

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:12.989
that are beyond the end of the road,

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:15.503
effectively putting those experts in their homes,

00:04:15.503 --> 00:04:17.481
allowing us to make diagnoses

00:04:17.481 --> 00:04:20.549
and make plans for treatment.

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:23.276
Project managers, hospital directors,

00:04:23.276 --> 00:04:25.195
are able to search on our interface

00:04:25.195 --> 00:04:27.197
by any parameter they may be interested in.

00:04:27.197 --> 00:04:29.220
Here in Nakuru, where I've been living,

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:30.556
we can search for people

00:04:30.556 --> 00:04:32.000
by whatever condition.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:33.272
Here are people who are blind

00:04:33.272 --> 00:04:35.802
from a curable condition cataract.

00:04:35.802 --> 00:04:37.831
Each red pin depicts somebody

00:04:37.831 --> 00:04:40.488
who is blind from a disease that is curable

00:04:40.488 --> 00:04:42.734
and treatable, and they're locatable.

00:04:42.734 --> 00:04:44.618
We can use bulk text messaging services

00:04:44.618 --> 00:04:47.772
to explain that we're coming to arrange a treatment.

00:04:47.772 --> 00:04:50.387
What's more, we've learned that this is something

00:04:50.387 --> 00:04:52.425
that we haven't built just for the community

00:04:52.425 --> 00:04:54.010
but with the community.

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:56.262
Those blue pins that drop represent

00:04:56.262 --> 00:04:58.363
elders, or local leaders,

00:04:58.363 --> 00:04:59.602
that are connected to those people

00:04:59.602 --> 00:05:00.935
who can ensure that we can find them

00:05:00.935 --> 00:05:03.036
and arrange treatment.

00:05:03.036 --> 00:05:06.038
So for patients like Mama Wangari,

00:05:06.038 --> 00:05:07.634
who have been blind for over 10 years

00:05:07.634 --> 00:05:09.263
and never seen her grandchildren,

00:05:09.263 --> 00:05:13.081
for less than 40 dollars, we can restore her eyesight.

00:05:13.081 --> 00:05:18.359
This is something that has to happen.

00:05:18.359 --> 00:05:19.990
It's only in statistics

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:22.713
that people go blind by the millions.

00:05:22.713 --> 00:05:26.581
The reality is everyone goes blind on their own.

00:05:26.581 --> 00:05:28.558
But now, they might just be

00:05:28.558 --> 00:05:30.697
a text message away from help.

00:05:30.697 --> 00:05:36.633
(Applause)

00:05:37.445 --> 00:05:39.576
And now because live demos are always a bad idea,

00:05:39.576 --> 00:05:41.374
we're going to try a live demo.

00:05:41.374 --> 00:05:42.630
(Laughter)

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:47.315
So here we have the Peek Vision app.

00:05:52.292 --> 00:05:54.936
Okay, and what we're looking at here,

00:05:54.936 --> 00:05:56.431
this is Sam's optic nerve,

00:05:56.431 --> 00:05:58.830
which is a direct extension of her brain,

00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:01.439
so I'm actually looking at her brain as we look there.

00:06:01.439 --> 00:06:04.970
We can see all parts of the retina.

00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:07.500
It makes it possible to pick up diseases

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:09.667
of the eye and of the body

00:06:09.667 --> 00:06:12.196
that would not be possible without access to the eye,

00:06:12.196 --> 00:06:14.131
and that clip-on device can be manufactured

00:06:14.131 --> 00:06:15.681
for just a few dollars,

00:06:15.681 --> 00:06:17.312
and people can be cured of blindness,

00:06:17.312 --> 00:06:20.535
and I think it says a lot about us as a human race

00:06:20.535 --> 00:06:23.060
if we've developed cures and we don't deliver them.

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:24.258
But now we can.

00:06:24.258 --> 00:06:26.474
Thank you.

00:06:26.474 --> 00:06:28.638
(Applause)
