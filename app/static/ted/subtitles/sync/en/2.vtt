00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:14.005
In terms of invention,

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:16.888
I'd like to tell you the tale
of one of my favorite projects.

00:00:16.912 --> 00:00:20.205
I think it's one of the most exciting
that I'm working on,

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:21.950
but I think it's also the simplest.

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:26.766
It's a project that has the potential
to make a huge impact around the world.

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:30.206
It addresses one of the biggest
health issues on the planet,

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:33.242
the number one cause of death
in children under five.

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:34.990
Which is ...?

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:38.910
Water-borne diseases?
Diarrhea? Malnutrition?

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:40.550
No.

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:44.646
It's breathing the smoke
from indoor cooking fires --

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.430
acute respiratory infections
caused by this.

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:49.390
Can you believe that?

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:53.286
I find this shocking
and somewhat appalling.

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:55.926
Can't we make
cleaner burning cooking fuels?

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:57.886
Can't we make better stoves?

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:01.926
How is it that this can lead
to over two million deaths every year?

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:06.286
I know Bill Joy was talking to you
about the wonders of carbon nanotubes,

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:10.126
so I'm going to talk to you
about the wonders of carbon macro-tubes,

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:11.366
which is charcoal.

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:13.366
(Laughter)

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:15.566
So this is a picture of rural Haiti.

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:18.886
Haiti is now 98 percent deforested.

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:22.006
You'll see scenes like this
all over the island.

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:24.806
It leads to all sorts
of environmental problems

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:29.086
and problems that affect people
throughout the nation.

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:31.166
A couple years ago
there was severe flooding

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:32.810
that led to thousands of deaths --

00:01:32.834 --> 00:01:34.766
that's directly attributable to the fact

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:37.766
that there are no trees on the hills
to stabilize the soil.

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:39.046
So the rains come --

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:41.510
they go down the rivers
and the flooding happens.

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:46.046
Now one of the reasons
why there are so few trees is this:

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:47.446
people need to cook,

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:51.566
and they harvest wood
and they make charcoal in order to do it.

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:54.495
It's not that people are ignorant
to the environmental damage.

00:01:54.519 --> 00:01:57.139
They know perfectly well,
but they have no other choice.

00:01:57.163 --> 00:01:59.166
Fossil fuels are not available,

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:04.086
and solar energy doesn't cook the way
that they like their food prepared.

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.246
And so this is what they do.

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:10.446
You'll find families like this who go out
into the forest to find a tree,

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:13.350
cut it down and make charcoal out of it.

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:15.806
So not surprisingly,

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:20.629
there's a lot of effort that's been done
to look at alternative cooking fuels.

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:24.566
About four years ago, I took
a team of students down to Haiti

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:27.006
and we worked with
Peace Corps volunteers there.

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:28.446
This is one such volunteer

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:32.086
and this is a device that he had built
in the village where he worked.

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:34.766
And the idea was
that you could take waste paper;

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:36.006
you could compress it

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:38.686
and make briquettes
that could be used for fuel.

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:40.726
But this device was very slow.

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:43.846
So our engineering students
went to work on it

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:45.966
and with some very simple changes,

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:49.046
they were able to triple
the throughput of this device.

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:51.606
So you could imagine
they were very excited about it.

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:55.430
And they took the briquettes back to MIT
so that they could test them.

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:00.406
And one of the things
that they found was they didn't burn.

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:03.206
So it was a little
discouraging to the students.

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:04.766
(Laughter)

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:07.166
And in fact, if you look closely,

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:09.790
right here you can see
it says, "US Peace Corps."

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:14.606
As it turns out, there actually wasn't
any waste paper in this village.

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:17.846
And while it was a good use
of government paperwork

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:20.775
for this volunteer to bring it
back with him to his village,

00:03:20.799 --> 00:03:22.886
it was 800 kilometers away.

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:25.806
And so we thought perhaps
there might be a better way

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:28.030
to come up with
an alternative cooking fuel.

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:31.046
What we wanted to do
is we wanted to make a fuel

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:34.406
that used something that was
readily available on the local level.

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:36.206
You see these all over Haiti as well.

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:37.966
They're small-scale sugar mills.

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:39.486
And the waste product from them

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:41.926
after you extract the juice
from the sugarcane

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:43.486
is called "bagasse."

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:44.726
It has no other use.

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:48.046
It has no nutritional value,
so they don't feed it to the animals.

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:52.110
It just sits in a pile near the sugar mill
until eventually they burn it.

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:55.486
What we wanted to do was
we wanted to find a way

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:58.486
to harness this waste resource
and turn it into a fuel

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:01.486
that would be something
that people could easily cook with,

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:02.750
something like charcoal.

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:05.366
So over the next couple of years,

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:09.046
students and I worked
to develop a process.

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:12.886
So you start with the bagasse,
and then you take a very simple kiln

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:16.086
that you can make out of
a waste fifty five-gallon oil drum.

00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:18.406
After some time, after setting it on fire,

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:22.406
you seal it to restrict the oxygen
that goes into the kiln,

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:25.430
and then you end up
with this carbonized material here.

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:27.806
However, you can't burn this.

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:32.525
It's too fine and it burns too quickly
to be useful for cooking.

00:04:32.549 --> 00:04:36.806
So we had to try to find a way
to form it into useful briquettes.

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:40.246
And conveniently,
one of my students was from Ghana,

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:43.604
and he remembered a dish his mom
used to make for him called "kokonte,"

00:04:43.628 --> 00:04:47.086
which is a very sticky porridge
made out of the cassava root.

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:48.686
And so what we did was we looked,

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:51.806
and we found that cassava
is indeed grown in Haiti,

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:53.966
under the name of "manioc."

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:55.943
In fact, it's grown all over the world --

00:04:55.967 --> 00:04:59.046
yucca, tapioca, manioc, cassava,
it's all the same thing --

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:01.166
a very starchy root vegetable.

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:04.406
And you can make a very thick,
sticky porridge out of it,

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:08.566
which you can use to bind together
the charcoal briquettes.

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:11.766
So we did this. We went down to Haiti.

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:14.446
These are the graduates
of the first Ecole de Charbon,

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:16.166
or Charcoal Institute.

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:17.406
And these --

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:18.646
(Laughter)

00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:24.646
That's right. So I'm actually
an instructor at MIT as well as CIT.

00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:26.750
And these are the briquettes that we made.

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:30.590
Now I'm going to take you
to a different continent.

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:32.686
This is India

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:35.926
and this is the most commonly used
cooking fuel in India.

00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:37.326
It's cow dung.

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:41.526
And more than in Haiti,
this produces really smoky fires,

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:44.006
and this is where you see
the health impacts

00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:48.110
of cooking with cow dung
and biomass as a fuel.

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:50.966
Kids and women
are especially affected by it,

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:54.126
because they're the ones
who are around the cooking fires.

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:55.366
So we wanted to see

00:05:55.390 --> 00:05:58.886
if we could introduce
this charcoal-making technology there.

00:05:58.910 --> 00:06:01.326
Well, unfortunately,
they didn't have sugarcane

00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:02.731
and they didn't have cassava,

00:06:02.755 --> 00:06:03.955
but that didn't stop us.

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:08.366
What we did was we found what were
the locally available sources of biomass.

00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:11.766
And there was wheat straw
and there was rice straw in this area.

00:06:11.790 --> 00:06:15.406
And what we could use as a binder
was actually small amounts of cow manure,

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:17.670
which they used ordinarily for their fuel.

00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:21.286
And we did side-by-side tests,

00:06:21.310 --> 00:06:23.886
and here you can see
the charcoal briquettes

00:06:23.910 --> 00:06:25.126
and here the cow dung.

00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:28.406
And you can see that it's a lot cleaner
burning of a cooking fuel.

00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:31.006
And in fact, it heats the water
a lot more quickly.

00:06:31.030 --> 00:06:33.326
And so we were very happy, thus far.

00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:35.046
But one of the things that we found

00:06:35.070 --> 00:06:37.886
was when we did side-by-side
comparisons with wood charcoal,

00:06:37.910 --> 00:06:39.526
it didn't burn as long.

00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:41.455
And the briquettes crumbled a little bit

00:06:41.479 --> 00:06:44.646
and we lost energy as they fell apart
as they were cooking.

00:06:44.670 --> 00:06:47.886
So we wanted to try to find a way
to make a stronger briquette

00:06:47.910 --> 00:06:51.510
so that we could compete with
wood charcoal in the markets in Haiti.

00:06:52.470 --> 00:06:54.486
So we went back to MIT,

00:06:54.510 --> 00:06:56.726
we took out the Instron machine

00:06:56.750 --> 00:06:59.446
and we figured out
what sort of forces you needed

00:06:59.470 --> 00:07:01.566
in order to compress
a briquette to the level

00:07:01.590 --> 00:07:04.448
that you actually are getting
improved performance out of it?

00:07:05.110 --> 00:07:08.406
And at the same time that we had
students in the lab looking at this,

00:07:08.430 --> 00:07:15.366
we also had community partners in Haiti
working to develop the process,

00:07:15.390 --> 00:07:20.390
to improve it and make it more accessible
to people in the villages there.

00:07:21.310 --> 00:07:22.526
And after some time,

00:07:22.550 --> 00:07:27.366
we developed a low-cost press
that allows you to produce charcoal,

00:07:27.390 --> 00:07:30.070
which actually now burns not only --

00:07:30.792 --> 00:07:34.110
actually, it burns longer,
cleaner than wood charcoal.

00:07:34.550 --> 00:07:37.086
So now we're in a situation
where we have a product,

00:07:37.110 --> 00:07:41.406
which is actually better than what
you can buy in Haiti in the marketplace,

00:07:41.430 --> 00:07:44.150
which is a very wonderful place to be.

00:07:46.110 --> 00:07:50.846
In Haiti alone, about 30 million trees
are cut down every year.

00:07:50.870 --> 00:07:53.366
There's a possibility
of this being implemented

00:07:53.390 --> 00:07:55.686
and saving a good portion of those.

00:07:55.710 --> 00:08:02.126
In addition, the revenue generated
from that charcoal is 260 million dollars.

00:08:02.150 --> 00:08:04.686
That's an awful lot
for a country like Haiti --

00:08:04.710 --> 00:08:06.566
with a population of eight million

00:08:06.590 --> 00:08:09.790
and an average income
of less than 400 dollars.

00:08:10.830 --> 00:08:14.686
So this is where we're also moving ahead
with our charcoal project.

00:08:14.710 --> 00:08:17.366
And one of the things
that I think is also interesting,

00:08:17.390 --> 00:08:21.686
is I have a friend up at UC Berkeley
who's been doing risk analysis.

00:08:21.710 --> 00:08:24.766
And he's looked at the problem
of the health impacts

00:08:24.790 --> 00:08:26.886
of burning wood versus charcoal.

00:08:26.910 --> 00:08:31.006
And he's found that worldwide,
you could prevent a million deaths

00:08:31.030 --> 00:08:34.006
switching from wood
to charcoal as a cooking fuel.

00:08:34.030 --> 00:08:35.246
That's remarkable,

00:08:35.270 --> 00:08:38.726
but up until now, there weren't ways
to do it without cutting down trees.

00:08:38.750 --> 00:08:39.966
But now we have a way

00:08:39.990 --> 00:08:43.670
that's using an agricultural
waste material to create a cooking fuel.

00:08:44.110 --> 00:08:46.126
One of the really exciting things, though,

00:08:46.150 --> 00:08:49.722
is something that came out of the trip
that I took to Ghana just last month.

00:08:49.746 --> 00:08:53.165
And I think it's the coolest thing,

00:08:53.189 --> 00:08:55.429
and it's even lower tech
than what you just saw,

00:08:55.453 --> 00:08:57.486
if you can imagine such a thing.

00:08:57.510 --> 00:08:58.726
Here it is.

00:08:58.750 --> 00:08:59.950
So what is this?

00:09:00.630 --> 00:09:03.206
This is corncobs turned into charcoal.

00:09:03.230 --> 00:09:06.373
And the beauty of this is
that you don't need to form briquettes --

00:09:06.397 --> 00:09:07.726
it comes ready made.

00:09:07.750 --> 00:09:10.606
This is my $100 laptop, right here.

00:09:10.630 --> 00:09:13.646
And actually, like Nick,
I brought samples.

00:09:13.670 --> 00:09:15.886
(Laughter)

00:09:15.910 --> 00:09:17.670
So we can pass these around.

00:09:19.670 --> 00:09:23.754
They're fully functional,
field-tested, ready to roll out.

00:09:23.778 --> 00:09:25.484
(Laughter)

00:09:27.670 --> 00:09:29.166
And I think one of the things

00:09:29.190 --> 00:09:33.406
which is also remarkable
about this technology,

00:09:33.430 --> 00:09:36.206
is that the technology
transfer is so easy.

00:09:36.230 --> 00:09:38.366
Compared to the sugarcane charcoal,

00:09:38.390 --> 00:09:41.206
where we have to teach people
how to form it into briquettes

00:09:41.230 --> 00:09:43.646
and you have the extra step
of cooking the binder,

00:09:43.670 --> 00:09:45.246
this comes pre-briquetted.

00:09:45.270 --> 00:09:48.223
And this is about the most exciting
thing in my life right now,

00:09:48.247 --> 00:09:51.446
which is perhaps
a sad commentary on my life.

00:09:51.470 --> 00:09:53.726
(Laughter)

00:09:53.750 --> 00:09:56.286
But once you see it,
like you guys in the front row --

00:09:56.310 --> 00:09:57.526
All right, yeah, OK.

00:09:57.550 --> 00:09:58.766
So anyway --

00:09:58.790 --> 00:10:00.806
(Laughter)

00:10:00.830 --> 00:10:02.046
Here it is.

00:10:02.070 --> 00:10:04.526
And this is, I think, a perfect example

00:10:04.550 --> 00:10:09.766
of what Robert Wright was talking about
in those non-zero-sum things.

00:10:09.790 --> 00:10:12.286
So not only do you have health benefits,

00:10:12.310 --> 00:10:14.446
you have environmental benefits.

00:10:14.470 --> 00:10:18.286
But this is one
of the incredibly rare situations

00:10:18.310 --> 00:10:20.646
where you also have economic benefits.

00:10:20.670 --> 00:10:23.726
People can make their own cooking fuel
from waste products.

00:10:23.750 --> 00:10:25.766
They can generate income from this.

00:10:25.790 --> 00:10:28.926
They can save the money
that they were going to spend on charcoal

00:10:28.950 --> 00:10:31.427
and they can produce excess
and sell it in the market

00:10:31.451 --> 00:10:33.406
to people who aren't making their own.

00:10:33.430 --> 00:10:35.726
It's really rare
that you don't have trade-offs

00:10:35.750 --> 00:10:38.966
between health and economics,
or environment and economics.

00:10:38.990 --> 00:10:42.726
So this is a project
that I just find extremely exciting

00:10:42.750 --> 00:10:48.150
and I'm really looking forward
to see where it takes us.

00:10:50.270 --> 00:10:53.766
So when we talk about, now,
the future we will create,

00:10:53.790 --> 00:10:55.806
one of the things
that I think is necessary

00:10:55.830 --> 00:10:59.790
is to have a very clear vision
of the world that we live in.

00:11:00.310 --> 00:11:03.096
And now, I don't actually mean
the world that we live in.

00:11:04.070 --> 00:11:08.166
I mean the world where women
spend two to three hours everyday

00:11:08.190 --> 00:11:10.630
grinding grain for their families to eat.

00:11:12.110 --> 00:11:14.486
I mean the world
where advanced building materials

00:11:14.510 --> 00:11:17.926
means cement roofing tiles
that are made by hand,

00:11:17.950 --> 00:11:20.086
and where, when you work 10 hours a day,

00:11:20.110 --> 00:11:22.950
you're still only earning
60 dollars in a month.

00:11:24.470 --> 00:11:25.686
I mean the world

00:11:25.710 --> 00:11:31.910
where women and children spend
40 billion hours a year fetching water.

00:11:32.670 --> 00:11:36.406
That's as if the entire workforce
of the state of California

00:11:36.430 --> 00:11:40.926
worked full time for a year
doing nothing but fetching water.

00:11:40.950 --> 00:11:45.286
It's a place where,
for example, if this were India,

00:11:45.310 --> 00:11:47.750
in this room, only three of us
would have a car.

00:11:48.510 --> 00:11:49.726
If this were Afghanistan,

00:11:49.750 --> 00:11:53.366
only one person in this room
would know how the use the Internet.

00:11:53.390 --> 00:11:54.590
If this were Zambia --

00:11:55.670 --> 00:11:58.366
300 of you would be farmers,

00:11:58.390 --> 00:12:01.526
100 of you would have AIDS or HIV.

00:12:01.550 --> 00:12:05.390
And more than half of you would be living
on less than a dollar a day.

00:12:06.430 --> 00:12:11.166
These are the issues that we
need to come up with solutions for.

00:12:11.190 --> 00:12:15.046
These are the issues that
we need to be training our engineers,

00:12:15.070 --> 00:12:18.510
our designers, our business people,
our entrepreneurs to be facing.

00:12:19.430 --> 00:12:22.126
These are the solutions
that we need to find.

00:12:22.150 --> 00:12:28.326
I have a few areas that I believe
are especially important that we address.

00:12:28.350 --> 00:12:30.406
One of them is creating technologies

00:12:30.430 --> 00:12:33.446
to promote micro-finance
and micro-enterprise,

00:12:33.470 --> 00:12:36.326
so that people who are living
below the poverty line

00:12:36.350 --> 00:12:37.886
can find a way to move out --

00:12:37.910 --> 00:12:39.291
and that they're not doing it

00:12:39.315 --> 00:12:42.926
using the same traditional
basket making, poultry rearing, etc.

00:12:42.950 --> 00:12:45.141
But there are new technologies
and new products

00:12:45.165 --> 00:12:47.405
that they can make on a small scale.

00:12:47.950 --> 00:12:49.166
The next thing I believe

00:12:49.190 --> 00:12:53.566
is that we need to create
technologies for poor farmers

00:12:53.590 --> 00:12:55.830
to add value to their own crops.

00:12:56.750 --> 00:12:59.406
And we need to rethink
our development strategies,

00:12:59.430 --> 00:13:02.686
so that we're not promoting
educational campaigns

00:13:02.710 --> 00:13:05.086
to get them to stop being farmers,

00:13:05.110 --> 00:13:07.886
but rather to stop being poor farmers.

00:13:07.910 --> 00:13:10.743
And we need to think
about how we can do that effectively.

00:13:11.710 --> 00:13:14.366
We need to work with the people
in these communities

00:13:14.390 --> 00:13:17.246
and give them the resources
and the tools that they need

00:13:17.270 --> 00:13:18.966
to solve their own problems.

00:13:18.990 --> 00:13:20.371
That's the best way to do it.

00:13:20.395 --> 00:13:22.686
We shouldn't be doing it from outside.

00:13:22.710 --> 00:13:26.870
So we need to create this future,
and we need to start doing it now.

00:13:27.390 --> 00:13:28.606
Thank you.

00:13:28.630 --> 00:13:33.886
(Applause)

00:13:33.910 --> 00:13:36.402
Chris Anderson: Thank you, incredible.

00:13:36.470 --> 00:13:37.670
Stay here.

00:13:38.510 --> 00:13:41.406
Tell us -- just while we see
if someone has a question --

00:13:41.430 --> 00:13:44.846
just tell us about one of the other things
that you've worked on.

00:13:44.870 --> 00:13:47.366
Amy Smith: Some of the other
things we're working on

00:13:47.390 --> 00:13:49.567
are ways to do low-cost
water quality testing,

00:13:49.591 --> 00:13:52.326
so that communities can maintain
their own water systems,

00:13:52.350 --> 00:13:55.065
know when they're working,
know when they treat them, etc.

00:13:55.089 --> 00:13:57.726
We're also looking at low-cost
water-treatment systems.

00:13:57.750 --> 00:14:01.131
One of the really exciting things
is looking at solar water disinfection

00:14:01.155 --> 00:14:03.715
and improving the ability
to be able to do that.

00:14:04.470 --> 00:14:08.406
CA: What's the bottleneck
preventing this stuff getting from scale?

00:14:08.430 --> 00:14:11.686
Do you need to find entrepreneurs,
or venture capitalists,

00:14:11.710 --> 00:14:16.566
or what do you need to take
what you've got and get it to scale?

00:14:16.590 --> 00:14:19.360
AS: I think it's large numbers
of people moving it forward.

00:14:19.384 --> 00:14:20.583
It's a difficult thing --

00:14:20.607 --> 00:14:22.614
it's a marketplace
which is very fragmented

00:14:22.638 --> 00:14:24.846
and a consumer population with no income.

00:14:24.870 --> 00:14:28.126
So you can't use the same models
that you use in the United States

00:14:28.150 --> 00:14:29.686
for making things move forward.

00:14:29.710 --> 00:14:31.726
And we're a pretty small staff,

00:14:31.750 --> 00:14:32.966
which is me.

00:14:32.990 --> 00:14:34.966
(Laughter)

00:14:34.990 --> 00:14:37.229
So, you know,
I do what I can with the students.

00:14:37.253 --> 00:14:39.492
We have 30 students a year
go out into the field

00:14:39.516 --> 00:14:41.966
and try to implement this
and move it forward.

00:14:41.990 --> 00:14:45.486
The other thing is you have to do things
with a long time frame,

00:14:45.510 --> 00:14:49.446
as, you know, you can't expect to get
something done in a year or two years;

00:14:49.470 --> 00:14:51.613
you have to be looking
five or 10 years ahead.

00:14:51.637 --> 00:14:54.837
But I think with the vision to do that,
we can move forward.
