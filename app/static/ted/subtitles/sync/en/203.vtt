00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:17.150
We are going to talk today about the sequel of "Inconvenient Truth."

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:22.150
It's time again to talk about "Inconvenient Truth,"

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:24.150
a truth that everyone is concerned about,

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.150
but nobody is willing to talk about.

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:30.150
Somebody has to take the lead, and I decided to do it.

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:34.150
If you are scared by global warming,

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:37.150
wait until we learn about local warming.

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:39.150
We will talk today about local warming.

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:45.150
Important health message: blogging may be hazardous to your health,

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:46.150
especially if you are a male.

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:50.150
This message is given as a public service.

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:54.150
Blogging affects your posture. We start with the posture.

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:58.150
This is the posture of ladies who are not blogging;

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:01.150
this is the posture of ladies who are blogging.

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:05.150
(Laughter)

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:08.150
This is the natural posture of a man sitting,

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:10.150
squatting for ventilation purposes.

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:13.150
(Laughter)

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:17.150
And this is the natural posture of a standing man,

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:20.150
and I think this picture inspired Chris to insert me

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:23.150
into the lateral thinking session.

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:28.150
This is male blogging posture sitting, and the result is,

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:30.150
"For greater comfort,

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.150
men naturally sit with their legs farther apart than women,

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:34.150
when working on laptop.

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:37.150
However, they will adopt a less natural posture

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:40.150
in order to balance it on their laps,

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:42.150
which resulted in a significant rise of body heat

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:46.150
between their thighs." This is the issue of local warming.

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:47.150
(Laughter)

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:52.150
This is a very serious newspaper; it's Times of England --

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:55.150
very serious. This is a very --

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:57.150
(Laughter)

00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:58.150
-- gentlemen and ladies, be serious.

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:03.150
This is a very serious research, that you should read the underline.

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:11.150
And be careful, your genes are in danger.

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:13.150
Will geeks become endangered species?

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:18.150
The fact: population growth in countries with high laptop --

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:20.150
(Laughter)

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:22.150
I need Hans Rosling to give me a graph.

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:24.150
(Applause)

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:25.150
Global warming fun.

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:28.150
(Laughter)

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:30.150
But let's keep things in proportion.

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:34.150
How to take care in five easy steps:

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:39.150
first of all, you can use natural ventilation. You can use body breath.

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:44.150
You should stay cool with the appropriate clothing.

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:47.150
You should care about your posture -- this is not right.

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:52.150
Can you extract from Chris another minute and a half for me,

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:54.150
because I have a video I have to show you.

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:57.150
(Applause)

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:00.150
You are great. This is the correct posture.

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:04.150
Another benefit of Wi-Fi, we learned yesterday about the benefits of Wi-Fi.

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:10.150
Wi-Fi enables you to avoid the processor. And there are some enhanced

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:12.150
protection measures, which I would like to share with you,

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:17.150
and I would like, in a minute, to thank Philips for helping.

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:21.150
This is a research which was done in '86, but it's still valid.

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:24.150
Scrotal temperature reflects intratesticular temperature

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:26.150
and is lowered by shaving.

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:29.150
By the way, I must admit, my English is not so good,

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:33.150
I didn't know what is scrotal; I understand it's a scrotum.

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:36.150
I guess in plural it's scrotal, like medium and media.

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:39.150
Digital scrotum, digital media.

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:45.150
And only last year I recognized that I'm a proud scrotum owner.

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:48.150
(Laughter)

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:52.150
And this research is being precipitated by the U.S. government,

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:55.150
so you can see that your tax man is working for good causes.

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:59.150
Video: Man: The Philips Bodygroom has a sleek,

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:02.150
ergonomic design for a safe and easy way to trim

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:08.150
those scruffy underarm hairs, the untidy curls on and around your

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:11.150
[bleep], as well as the hard to reach locks on the underside of your

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:17.150
[bleep] and [bleep]. Once you use the Bodygroom, the world looks different.

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:22.150
And so does your [bleep]. These days, with a hair-free back,

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:26.150
well-groomed shoulders and an extra optical inch on my [bleep],

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:33.150
well, let's just say life has gotten pretty darn cozy.

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:41.150
Yossi Vardi: This is one of the most popular viral advertisement of last year,

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:45.150
known as the optical inch by Philips. Let's applaud Philips --

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:46.150
(Applause)

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:48.150
-- for this gesture for humanity.

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:52.150
And this is how they are promoting the product. This is --

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:54.150
I didn't touch it, this is original.

00:04:54.150 --> 00:05:01.150
Laptop use to solve overpopulation. And if everything failed,

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:03.150
there are some secondary uses.

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:10.150
And then our next talk, our next TED if you invite me

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:12.150
will be why you should not carry a cell phone in your pocket.

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:17.150
And this is what the young generation says.

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:21.150
(Applause)

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:23.150
And I just want to show you that I'm not just preaching,

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:25.150
but I also practice.

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:28.150
(Laughter)

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:29.150
4 am in the morning.

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:32.150
(Laughter)

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:33.150
You cannot use this picture.

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:38.150
(Applause)

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:47.150
Now, I have some mini TED Prizes, this is the Philips Bodygroom,

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:48.150
one for our leader.

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:52.150
(Applause)

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:54.150
Anybody feels threatened, anybody really need it?

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:57.150
(Laughter)

00:05:57.150 --> 00:06:02.150
Any lady, any lady? Thank you very much.

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:09.150
(Applause)
