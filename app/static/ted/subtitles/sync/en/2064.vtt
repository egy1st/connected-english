00:00:12.956 --> 00:00:14.456
I would like to share with you today

00:00:14.456 --> 00:00:16.610
a project that has changed how I approach

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:18.521
and practice architecture:

00:00:18.521 --> 00:00:21.449
the Fez River Rehabilitation Project.

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:23.790
My hometown of Fez, Morocco,

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:27.457
boasts one of the largest walled
medieval cities in the world,

00:00:27.457 --> 00:00:30.186
called the medina, nestled in a river valley.

00:00:30.196 --> 00:00:33.784
The entire city is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

00:00:33.784 --> 00:00:37.760
Since the 1950s, as the
population of the medina grew,

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:39.680
basic urban infrastructure

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:42.610
such as green open spaces and sewage

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:47.260
quickly changed and got highly stressed.

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:50.215
One of the biggest casualties of the situation

00:00:50.215 --> 00:00:54.178
was the Fez River, which bisects
the medina in its middle

00:00:54.178 --> 00:00:57.150
and has been considered for many centuries

00:00:57.150 --> 00:00:59.722
as the city's very soul.

00:00:59.722 --> 00:01:02.140
In fact, one can witness the presence

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:05.320
of the river's extensive water network

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:06.601
all throughout the city,

00:01:06.601 --> 00:01:10.222
in places such as private and public fountains.

00:01:10.222 --> 00:01:14.071
Unfortunately, because of the pollution of the river,

00:01:14.071 --> 00:01:16.507
it has been covered little by little

00:01:16.507 --> 00:01:19.581
by concrete slabs since 1952.

00:01:19.581 --> 00:01:23.009
This process of erasure was coupled

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.045
with the destruction of many houses

00:01:25.045 --> 00:01:26.537
along the river banks

00:01:26.537 --> 00:01:28.526
to be able to make machineries

00:01:28.526 --> 00:01:33.190
enter the narrow pedestrian network of the medina.

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:36.485
Those urban voids quickly became illegal parking

00:01:36.485 --> 00:01:38.441
or trash yards.

00:01:38.441 --> 00:01:40.410
Actually, the state of the river

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:43.685
before entering the medina is pretty healthy.

00:01:43.685 --> 00:01:45.980
Then pollution takes its toll,

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:48.399
mainly due to untreated sewage

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:52.050
and chemical dumping from crafts such as tanning.

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:54.100
At some point, I couldn't bear

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:55.755
the desecration of the river,

00:01:55.755 --> 00:01:58.485
such an important part of my city,

00:01:58.485 --> 00:02:00.136
and I decided to take action,

00:02:00.136 --> 00:02:02.471
especially after I heard that the city

00:02:02.471 --> 00:02:05.565
received a grant to divert sewage water

00:02:05.565 --> 00:02:07.185
and to treat it.

00:02:07.185 --> 00:02:09.142
With clean water, suddenly

00:02:09.142 --> 00:02:11.617
the uncovering of the river became possible,

00:02:11.617 --> 00:02:14.497
and with luck and actually a lot of pushing,

00:02:14.497 --> 00:02:16.713
my partner Takako Tajima and I

00:02:16.713 --> 00:02:20.344
were commissioned by the city to
work with a team of engineers

00:02:20.344 --> 00:02:22.452
to uncover the river.

00:02:22.452 --> 00:02:24.407
However, we were sneaky,

00:02:24.407 --> 00:02:25.724
and we proposed more:

00:02:25.724 --> 00:02:30.400
to convert riverbanks into pedestrian pathways,

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:32.360
and then to connect these pathways

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:34.003
back to the city fabric,

00:02:34.003 --> 00:02:36.556
and finally to convert the urban voids

00:02:36.556 --> 00:02:39.987
along the riverbanks into public spaces

00:02:39.987 --> 00:02:42.337
that are lacking in the Medina of Fez.

00:02:42.337 --> 00:02:44.104
I will show you briefly now

00:02:44.104 --> 00:02:47.141
two of these public spaces.

00:02:47.141 --> 00:02:49.921
The first one is the Rcif Plaza,

00:02:49.921 --> 00:02:53.003
which sits actually right on top of the river,

00:02:53.003 --> 00:02:56.040
which you can see here in dotted lines.

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:59.707
This plaza used to be a chaotic transportation hub

00:02:59.707 --> 00:03:01.631
that actually compromised the urban integrity

00:03:01.631 --> 00:03:03.999
of the medina, that has the largest

00:03:03.999 --> 00:03:06.598
pedestrian network in the world.

00:03:06.598 --> 00:03:09.703
And right beyond the historic
bridge that you can see here,

00:03:09.703 --> 00:03:11.514
right next to the plaza,

00:03:11.514 --> 00:03:13.674
you can see that the river looked like

00:03:13.674 --> 00:03:15.935
a river of trash.

00:03:15.935 --> 00:03:18.167
Instead, what we proposed is to make

00:03:18.167 --> 00:03:20.525
the plaza entirely pedestrian,

00:03:20.525 --> 00:03:23.428
to cover it with recycled leather canopies,

00:03:23.428 --> 00:03:27.180
and to connect it to the banks of the river.

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:29.064
The second site of intervention

00:03:29.064 --> 00:03:32.070
is also an urban void along the river banks,

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:34.417
and it used to be an illegal parking,

00:03:34.417 --> 00:03:35.872
and we proposed to transform it

00:03:35.872 --> 00:03:38.947
into the first playground in the medina.

00:03:38.947 --> 00:03:42.675
The playground is constructed using recycled tires

00:03:42.675 --> 00:03:45.510
and also is coupled with a constructed wetland

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:47.940
that not only cleans the water of the river

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:51.531
but also retains it when floods occur.

00:03:51.531 --> 00:03:54.562
As the project progressed and
received several design awards,

00:03:54.562 --> 00:03:56.830
new stakeholders intervened

00:03:56.830 --> 00:04:00.608
and changed the project goals and design.

00:04:00.608 --> 00:04:03.390
The only way for us to be able to bring

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:06.682
the main goals of the project ahead

00:04:06.682 --> 00:04:09.112
was for us to do something very unusual

00:04:09.112 --> 00:04:11.024
that usually architects don't do.

00:04:11.024 --> 00:04:14.276
It was for us to take our design ego

00:04:14.276 --> 00:04:15.752
and our sense of authorship

00:04:15.752 --> 00:04:17.886
and put it in the backseat

00:04:17.886 --> 00:04:20.395
and to focus mainly on being activists

00:04:20.395 --> 00:04:22.300
and on trying to coalesce

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:24.591
all of the agendas of stakeholders

00:04:24.591 --> 00:04:27.414
and focus on the main goals of the project:

00:04:27.414 --> 00:04:29.946
that is, to uncover the river, treat its water,

00:04:29.946 --> 00:04:31.940
and provide public spaces for all.

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:33.432
We were actually very lucky,

00:04:33.432 --> 00:04:35.975
and many of those goals happened

00:04:35.975 --> 00:04:37.568
or are in the process of happening.

00:04:37.568 --> 00:04:39.628
Like, you can see here in the Rcif Plaza.

00:04:39.628 --> 00:04:42.319
This is how it looked like about six years ago.

00:04:42.319 --> 00:04:44.401
This is how it looks like today.

00:04:44.401 --> 00:04:46.133
It's still under construction,

00:04:46.133 --> 00:04:47.630
but actually it is heavily used

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:49.273
by the local population.

00:04:49.273 --> 00:04:52.096
And finally, this is how the Rcif Plaza will look like

00:04:52.096 --> 00:04:53.981
when the project is completed.

00:04:53.981 --> 00:04:57.979
This is the river, covered, used as a trash yard.

00:04:57.979 --> 00:04:59.801
Then after many years of work,

00:04:59.801 --> 00:05:02.535
the river with clean water, uncovered.

00:05:02.535 --> 00:05:04.560
And finally, you can see here the river

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:07.001
when the project will be completed.

00:05:07.001 --> 00:05:09.442
So for sure, the Fez River Rehabilitation

00:05:09.442 --> 00:05:11.860
will keep on changing and adapting

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:14.088
to the sociopolitical landscape of the city,

00:05:14.088 --> 00:05:17.148
but we strongly believe that by reimagining

00:05:17.148 --> 00:05:19.589
the role and the agency of the architect,

00:05:19.589 --> 00:05:23.548
we have set up the core idea
of the project into motion;

00:05:23.548 --> 00:05:26.057
that is, to transform the river from sewage

00:05:26.057 --> 00:05:27.711
to public space for all,

00:05:27.711 --> 00:05:30.883
thereby making sure that the city of Fez

00:05:30.883 --> 00:05:33.110
will remain a living city for its inhabitants

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:35.270
rather than a mummified heritage.

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:37.006
Thank you very much.

00:05:37.006 --> 00:05:37.925
(Applause)
