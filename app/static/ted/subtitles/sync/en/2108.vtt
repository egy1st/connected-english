WEBVTT

00:00:12.558 --> 00:00:18.320
So imagine that a plane is about to crash

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:21.121
with 250 children and babies,

00:00:21.121 --> 00:00:24.540
and if you knew how to stop that, would you?

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:26.511
Now imagine

00:00:26.511 --> 00:00:30.150
that 60 planes full of babies under five

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:33.360
crash every single day.

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.132
That's the number of kids

00:00:35.132 --> 00:00:37.457
that never make it to their fifth birthday.

00:00:37.457 --> 00:00:40.697
6.6 million children

00:00:40.697 --> 00:00:44.288
never make it to their fifth birthday.

00:00:44.288 --> 00:00:46.744
Most of these deaths are preventable,

00:00:46.744 --> 00:00:48.712
and that doesn't just make me sad,

00:00:48.712 --> 00:00:50.408
it makes me angry,

00:00:50.408 --> 00:00:52.766
and it makes me determined.

00:00:52.766 --> 00:00:54.656
Diarrhea and pneumonia

00:00:54.656 --> 00:00:56.472
are among the top two killers

00:00:56.472 --> 00:00:58.790
of children under five,

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:01.046
and what we can do to prevent these diseases

00:01:01.046 --> 00:01:03.226
isn't some smart,

00:01:03.226 --> 00:01:06.143
new technological innovations.

00:01:06.143 --> 00:01:11.022
It's one of the world's oldest inventions:

00:01:11.022 --> 00:01:14.547
a bar of soap.

00:01:14.547 --> 00:01:15.979
Washing hands with soap,

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:18.350
a habit we all take for granted,

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:20.634
can reduce diarrhea by half,

00:01:20.634 --> 00:01:24.290
can reduce respiratory infections by one third.

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:26.061
Handwashing with soap

00:01:26.061 --> 00:01:27.710
can have an impact

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:32.737
on reducing flu, trachoma, SARS,

00:01:32.737 --> 00:01:35.127
and most recently in the case of cholera

00:01:35.127 --> 00:01:37.817
and Ebola outbreak,

00:01:37.817 --> 00:01:39.508
one of the key interventions

00:01:39.508 --> 00:01:42.326
is handwashing with soap.

00:01:42.326 --> 00:01:45.581
Handwashing with soap keeps kids in school.

00:01:45.581 --> 00:01:48.404
It stops babies from dying.

00:01:48.404 --> 00:01:50.277
Handwashing with soap

00:01:50.277 --> 00:01:53.074
is one of the most cost-effective

00:01:53.074 --> 00:01:55.620
ways of saving children's lives.

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:59.276
It can save over 600,000 children every year.

00:01:59.276 --> 00:02:02.240
That's the equivalent of stopping

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:04.220
10 jumbo jets

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:06.148
full of babies and children

00:02:06.148 --> 00:02:08.859
from crashing every single day.

00:02:08.859 --> 00:02:11.283
I think you'll agree with me that that's a pretty

00:02:11.283 --> 00:02:14.565
useful public health intervention.

00:02:14.565 --> 00:02:17.515
So now just take a minute.

00:02:17.515 --> 00:02:19.451
I think you need to get to
know the person next to you.

00:02:19.451 --> 00:02:21.399
Why don't you just shake their hands.

00:02:21.399 --> 00:02:23.643
Please shake their hands.

00:02:23.643 --> 00:02:24.943
All right, get to know each other.

00:02:24.943 --> 00:02:26.478
They look really pretty.

00:02:26.478 --> 00:02:28.251
All right.

00:02:28.251 --> 00:02:30.549
So what if I told you

00:02:30.549 --> 00:02:33.134
that the person whose hands you just shook

00:02:33.134 --> 00:02:34.842
actually didn't wash their hands

00:02:34.842 --> 00:02:37.500
when they were coming out of the toilet?
(Laughter)

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:40.830
They don't look so pretty anymore, right?

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:43.986
Pretty yucky, you would agree with me.

00:02:43.986 --> 00:02:45.651
Well, statistics are actually showing

00:02:45.651 --> 00:02:48.067
that four people out of five

00:02:48.067 --> 00:02:50.675
don't wash their hands when
they come out of the toilet,

00:02:50.675 --> 00:02:52.363
globally.

00:02:52.363 --> 00:02:54.633
And the same way,

00:02:54.633 --> 00:02:57.377
we don't do it when we've got fancy toilets,

00:02:57.377 --> 00:02:59.827
running water, and soap available,

00:02:59.827 --> 00:03:01.761
it's the same thing in the countries

00:03:01.761 --> 00:03:05.135
where child mortality is really high.

00:03:05.135 --> 00:03:07.449
What is it? Is there no soap?

00:03:07.449 --> 00:03:09.698
Actually, soap is available.

00:03:09.698 --> 00:03:13.353
In 90 percent of households in India,

00:03:13.353 --> 00:03:16.033
94 percent of households in Kenya,

00:03:16.033 --> 00:03:17.513
you will find soap.

00:03:17.513 --> 00:03:21.350
Even in countries where soap is the lowest,

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:24.929
like Ethiopia, we are at 50 percent.

00:03:24.929 --> 00:03:26.156
So why is it?

00:03:26.156 --> 00:03:29.089
Why aren't people washing their hands?

00:03:29.089 --> 00:03:31.473
Why is it that Mayank,

00:03:31.473 --> 00:03:33.740
this young boy that I met in India,

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:35.485
isn't washing his hands?

00:03:35.485 --> 00:03:38.097
Well, in Mayank's family,

00:03:38.097 --> 00:03:40.529
soap is used for bathing,

00:03:40.529 --> 00:03:42.521
soap is used for laundry,

00:03:42.521 --> 00:03:45.390
soap is used for washing dishes.

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:47.257
His parents think sometimes

00:03:47.257 --> 00:03:48.821
it's a precious commodity,

00:03:48.821 --> 00:03:51.088
so they'll keep it in a cupboard.

00:03:51.088 --> 00:03:53.842
They'll keep it away from him so he doesn't waste it.

00:03:53.842 --> 00:03:56.392
On average, in Mayank's family,

00:03:56.392 --> 00:03:58.464
they will use soap for washing hands

00:03:58.464 --> 00:03:59.915
once a day

00:03:59.915 --> 00:04:02.280
at the very best, and sometimes

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:05.265
even once a week for washing hands with soap.

00:04:05.265 --> 00:04:07.480
What's the result of that?

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:09.345
Children pick up disease

00:04:09.345 --> 00:04:11.020
in the place that's supposed to love them

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:15.928
and protect them the most, in their homes.

00:04:15.928 --> 00:04:18.476
Think about where you learned to wash your hands.

00:04:18.476 --> 00:04:21.280
Did you learn to wash your hands at home?

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:24.056
Did you learn to wash your hands in school?

00:04:24.056 --> 00:04:26.536
I think behavioral scientists will tell you

00:04:26.536 --> 00:04:29.075
that it's very difficult to change the habits

00:04:29.075 --> 00:04:33.960
that you have had early in life.

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:36.757
However, we all copy what everyone else does,

00:04:36.757 --> 00:04:39.481
and local cultural norms are something

00:04:39.481 --> 00:04:42.792
that shape how we change our behavior,

00:04:42.792 --> 00:04:45.568
and this is where the private sector comes in.

00:04:45.568 --> 00:04:49.368
Every second in Asia and Africa,

00:04:49.368 --> 00:04:52.290
111 mothers

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:56.008
will buy this bar to protect their family.

00:04:56.008 --> 00:04:58.048
Many women in India will tell you

00:04:58.048 --> 00:05:00.274
they learned all about hygiene, diseases,

00:05:00.274 --> 00:05:04.020
from this bar of soap from Lifebuoy brand.

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:05.895
Iconic brands like this one

00:05:05.895 --> 00:05:07.783
have a responsibility to do good

00:05:07.783 --> 00:05:10.264
in the places where they sell their products.

00:05:10.264 --> 00:05:13.439
It's that belief, plus the scale of Unilever,

00:05:13.439 --> 00:05:15.879
that allows us to keep talking about

00:05:15.879 --> 00:05:19.695
handwashing with soap and
hygiene to these mothers.

00:05:19.695 --> 00:05:22.967
Big businesses and brands can change

00:05:22.967 --> 00:05:25.119
and shift those social norms

00:05:25.119 --> 00:05:27.031
and make a difference for those habits

00:05:27.031 --> 00:05:29.211
that are so stubborn.

00:05:29.211 --> 00:05:30.469
Think about it:

00:05:30.469 --> 00:05:33.974
Marketeers spend all their time

00:05:33.974 --> 00:05:38.330
making us switch from one brand to the other.

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:41.320
And actually, they know how to transform

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:44.353
science and facts into compelling messages.

00:05:44.353 --> 00:05:46.249
Just for a minute, imagine

00:05:46.249 --> 00:05:48.990
when they put all their forces behind

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:51.940
a message as powerful as handwashing with soap.

00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:54.899
The profit motive is transforming health outcomes

00:05:54.899 --> 00:05:56.777
in this world.

00:05:56.777 --> 00:05:58.596
But it's been happening for centuries:

00:05:58.596 --> 00:06:02.129
the Lifebuoy brand was launched in 1894

00:06:02.129 --> 00:06:03.865
in Victorian England

00:06:03.865 --> 00:06:06.137
to actually combat cholera.

00:06:06.137 --> 00:06:08.441
Last week, I was in Ghana

00:06:08.441 --> 00:06:09.980
with the minister of health,

00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:11.199
because if you don't know,

00:06:11.199 --> 00:06:13.856
there's a cholera outbreak in Ghana at the moment.

00:06:13.856 --> 00:06:15.992
A hundred and eighteen years later,

00:06:15.992 --> 00:06:17.912
the solution is exactly the same:

00:06:17.912 --> 00:06:20.408
It's about ensuring that they have access

00:06:20.408 --> 00:06:21.824
to this bar of soap,

00:06:21.824 --> 00:06:23.569
and that they're using it,

00:06:23.569 --> 00:06:25.529
because that's the number one way

00:06:25.529 --> 00:06:28.760
to actually stop cholera from spreading.

00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:31.160
I think this drive for profit

00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:33.031
is extremely powerful,

00:06:33.031 --> 00:06:34.491
sometimes more powerful than

00:06:34.491 --> 00:06:37.786
the most committed charity or government.

00:06:37.786 --> 00:06:39.588
Government is doing what they can,

00:06:39.588 --> 00:06:42.963
especially in terms of the pandemics

00:06:42.963 --> 00:06:45.500
and epidemics such as cholera,

00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:46.955
or Ebola at the moment,

00:06:46.955 --> 00:06:49.495
but with competing priorities.

00:06:49.495 --> 00:06:52.000
The budget is not always there.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:53.863
And when you think about this,

00:06:53.863 --> 00:06:55.970
you think about what is required

00:06:55.970 --> 00:06:58.291
to make handwashing a daily habit,

00:06:58.291 --> 00:07:02.112
it requires sustained funding

00:07:02.112 --> 00:07:05.220
to refine this behavior.

00:07:05.220 --> 00:07:09.653
In short, those that fight for public health

00:07:09.653 --> 00:07:12.417
are actually dependent upon the soap companies

00:07:12.417 --> 00:07:15.413
to keep promoting handwashing with soap.

00:07:15.413 --> 00:07:18.655
We have friends like USAID,

00:07:18.655 --> 00:07:21.960
the Global Public-Private Partnership
for Handwashing with Soap,

00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:24.120
London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine,

00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:25.689
Plan, WaterAid,

00:07:25.689 --> 00:07:27.196
that all believe

00:07:27.196 --> 00:07:30.911
for a win-win-win partnership.

00:07:30.911 --> 00:07:32.896
Win for the public sector,

00:07:32.896 --> 00:07:35.971
because we help them reach their targets.

00:07:35.971 --> 00:07:38.359
Win for the private sector,

00:07:38.359 --> 00:07:39.773
because we build new generations

00:07:39.773 --> 00:07:41.570
of future handwashers.

00:07:41.570 --> 00:07:43.783
And most importantly,

00:07:43.783 --> 00:07:46.390
win for the most vulnerable.

00:07:46.390 --> 00:07:48.446
On October 15,

00:07:48.446 --> 00:07:50.798
we will celebrate Global Handwashing Day.

00:07:50.798 --> 00:07:52.518
Schools, communities,

00:07:52.518 --> 00:07:54.398
our friends in the public sector

00:07:54.398 --> 00:07:57.014
and our friends in the private sector —

00:07:57.014 --> 00:07:59.294
yes, on that day even our competitors,

00:07:59.294 --> 00:08:01.280
we all join hands to celebrate

00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:03.262
the world's most important

00:08:03.262 --> 00:08:05.310
public health intervention.

00:08:05.310 --> 00:08:06.535
What's required,

00:08:06.535 --> 00:08:09.271
and again where the private sector
can make a huge difference,

00:08:09.271 --> 00:08:13.037
is coming up with this big, creative thinking

00:08:13.037 --> 00:08:15.278
that drives advocacy.

00:08:15.278 --> 00:08:17.941
If you take our Help a Child Reach 5 campaign,

00:08:17.941 --> 00:08:20.920
we've created great films

00:08:20.920 --> 00:08:23.006
that bring the message of handwashing with soap

00:08:23.006 --> 00:08:24.701
to the everyday person

00:08:24.701 --> 00:08:27.277
in a way that can relate to them.

00:08:27.277 --> 00:08:29.037
We've had over 30 million views.

00:08:29.037 --> 00:08:31.564
Most of these discussions are still happening online.

00:08:31.564 --> 00:08:33.036
I urge you to take five minutes

00:08:33.036 --> 00:08:37.093
and look at those films.

00:08:37.093 --> 00:08:38.622
I come from Mali,

00:08:38.622 --> 00:08:40.965
one of the world's poorest countries.

00:08:40.965 --> 00:08:43.701
I grew up in a family where every dinner conversation

00:08:43.701 --> 00:08:45.879
was around social justice.

00:08:45.879 --> 00:08:49.407
I trained in Europe's premier school of public health.

00:08:49.407 --> 00:08:51.135
I think I'm probably one of the only women

00:08:51.135 --> 00:08:54.576
in my country with this high degree in health,

00:08:54.576 --> 00:08:56.060
and the only one

00:08:56.060 --> 00:08:59.662
with a doctorate in handwashing with soap.

00:08:59.662 --> 00:09:01.398
(Laughter)

00:09:01.398 --> 00:09:05.610
(Applause)

00:09:08.022 --> 00:09:10.373
Nine years ago, I decided,

00:09:10.373 --> 00:09:13.286
with a successful public health career in the making,

00:09:13.286 --> 00:09:16.814
that I could make the biggest impact coming,

00:09:16.814 --> 00:09:19.845
selling and promoting the world's best invention

00:09:19.845 --> 00:09:22.380
in public health: soap.

00:09:22.380 --> 00:09:24.509
We run today the world's largest

00:09:24.509 --> 00:09:25.880
handwashing program

00:09:25.880 --> 00:09:28.458
by any public health standards.

00:09:28.458 --> 00:09:31.930
We've reached over 183 million people

00:09:31.930 --> 00:09:35.120
in 16 countries.

00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:36.956
My team and I have the ambition

00:09:36.956 --> 00:09:40.714
to reach one billion by 2020.

00:09:40.714 --> 00:09:42.908
Over the last four years,

00:09:42.908 --> 00:09:45.636
business has grown double digits,

00:09:45.636 --> 00:09:47.573
whilst child mortality has reduced

00:09:47.573 --> 00:09:51.995
in all the places where soap use has increased.

00:09:51.995 --> 00:09:54.300
It may be uncomfortable for some to hear —

00:09:54.300 --> 00:09:56.555
business growth and lives saved

00:09:56.555 --> 00:10:00.068
somehow equated in the same sentence —

00:10:00.068 --> 00:10:01.987
but it is that business growth

00:10:01.987 --> 00:10:04.283
that allows us to keep doing more.

00:10:04.283 --> 00:10:07.027
Without it, and without talking about it,

00:10:07.027 --> 00:10:11.075
we cannot achieve the change that we need.

00:10:11.075 --> 00:10:13.260
Last week, my team and I

00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:16.556
spent time visiting mothers

00:10:16.556 --> 00:10:19.067
that have all experienced the same thing:

00:10:19.067 --> 00:10:21.499
the death of a newborn.

00:10:21.499 --> 00:10:24.499
I'm a mom. I can't imagine anything more powerful

00:10:24.499 --> 00:10:27.412
and more painful.

00:10:27.412 --> 00:10:30.044
This one is from Myanmar.

00:10:30.044 --> 00:10:32.050
She had the most beautiful smile,

00:10:32.050 --> 00:10:34.260
the smile, I think, that life gives you

00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:36.647
when you've had a second chance.

00:10:36.647 --> 00:10:39.981
Her son, Myo, is her second one.

00:10:39.981 --> 00:10:41.885
She had a daughter

00:10:41.885 --> 00:10:44.277
who passed away at three weeks,

00:10:44.277 --> 00:10:46.630
and we know that the majority

00:10:46.630 --> 00:10:47.970
of children that actually die

00:10:47.970 --> 00:10:49.836
die in the first month of their life,

00:10:49.836 --> 00:10:52.704
and we know that if we give a bar of soap

00:10:52.704 --> 00:10:54.964
to every skilled birth attendant,

00:10:54.964 --> 00:10:57.514
and that if soap is used 
before touching the babies,

00:10:57.514 --> 00:10:58.756
we can reduce and make a change

00:10:58.756 --> 00:11:00.800
in terms of those numbers.

00:11:00.800 --> 00:11:02.668
And that's what inspires me,

00:11:02.668 --> 00:11:04.900
inspires me to continue in this mission,

00:11:04.900 --> 00:11:07.284
to know that I can equip her

00:11:07.284 --> 00:11:09.089
with what's needed

00:11:09.089 --> 00:11:10.940
so that she can do

00:11:10.940 --> 00:11:13.004
the most beautiful job in the world:

00:11:13.004 --> 00:11:15.130
nurturing her newborn.

00:11:15.130 --> 00:11:17.435
And next time you think of a gift

00:11:17.435 --> 00:11:19.525
for a new mom and her family,

00:11:19.525 --> 00:11:22.315
don't look far: buy her soap.

00:11:22.315 --> 00:11:25.523
It's the most beautiful invention in public health.

00:11:25.523 --> 00:11:27.899
I hope you will join us

00:11:27.899 --> 00:11:30.851
and make handwashing part of your daily lives

00:11:30.851 --> 00:11:32.555
and our daily lives

00:11:32.555 --> 00:11:34.779
and help more children like Myo

00:11:34.779 --> 00:11:35.907
reach their fifth birthday.

00:11:35.907 --> 00:11:38.314
Thank you.

00:11:38.314 --> 00:11:40.528
(Applause)
