WEBVTT

00:00:12.962 --> 00:00:14.599
So I started working

00:00:14.599 --> 00:00:16.483
with refugees because I wanted

00:00:16.483 --> 00:00:18.823
to make a difference,

00:00:18.823 --> 00:00:20.230
and making a difference starts

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:22.586
with telling their stories.

00:00:22.586 --> 00:00:24.076
So when I meet refugees,

00:00:24.076 --> 00:00:26.876
I always ask them questions.

00:00:26.876 --> 00:00:29.194
Who bombed your house?

00:00:29.194 --> 00:00:31.847
Who killed your son?

00:00:31.847 --> 00:00:35.891
Did the rest of your family make it out alive?

00:00:35.891 --> 00:00:37.877
How are you coping

00:00:37.877 --> 00:00:40.408
in your life in exile?

00:00:40.408 --> 00:00:43.411
But there's one question that always seems to me

00:00:43.411 --> 00:00:45.875
to be most revealing, and that is:

00:00:45.875 --> 00:00:48.057
What did you take?

00:00:48.057 --> 00:00:50.307
What was that most important thing

00:00:50.307 --> 00:00:52.379
that you had to take with you

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:55.785
when the bombs were exploding in your town,

00:00:55.785 --> 00:01:00.210
and the armed gangs were approaching your house?

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.815
A Syrian refugee boy I know

00:01:02.815 --> 00:01:05.505
told me that he didn't hesitate

00:01:05.505 --> 00:01:09.295
when his life was in imminent danger.

00:01:09.295 --> 00:01:12.276
He took his high school diploma,

00:01:12.276 --> 00:01:14.205
and later he told me why.

00:01:14.205 --> 00:01:17.413
He said, "I took my high school diploma

00:01:17.413 --> 00:01:20.619
because my life depended on it."

00:01:20.619 --> 00:01:23.848
And he would risk his life to get that diploma.

00:01:23.848 --> 00:01:27.530
On his way to school, he would dodge snipers.

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:30.045
His classroom sometimes shook

00:01:30.045 --> 00:01:33.279
with the sound of bombs and shelling,

00:01:33.279 --> 00:01:36.086
and his mother told me,

00:01:36.086 --> 00:01:39.155
"Every day, I would say to him every morning,

00:01:39.155 --> 00:01:42.081
'Honey, please don't go to school.'"

00:01:42.081 --> 00:01:45.540
And when he insisted, she said,

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:49.512
"I would hug him as if it were for the last time."

00:01:49.512 --> 00:01:51.542
But he said to his mother,

00:01:51.542 --> 00:01:53.387
"We're all afraid,

00:01:53.387 --> 00:01:56.278
but our determination to graduate

00:01:56.278 --> 00:01:59.612
is stronger than our fear."

00:01:59.612 --> 00:02:02.948
But one day, the family got terrible news.

00:02:02.948 --> 00:02:05.682
Hany's aunt, his uncle and his cousin

00:02:05.682 --> 00:02:08.371
were murdered in their homes for refusing

00:02:08.371 --> 00:02:09.365
to leave their house.

00:02:09.365 --> 00:02:12.230
Their throats were slit.

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:14.861
It was time to flee.

00:02:14.861 --> 00:02:17.875
They left that day, right away, in their car,

00:02:17.875 --> 00:02:19.736
Hany hidden in the back because they were facing

00:02:19.736 --> 00:02:23.646
checkpoints of menacing soldiers.

00:02:23.646 --> 00:02:27.358
And they would cross the border into Lebanon,

00:02:27.358 --> 00:02:30.054
where they would find peace.

00:02:30.054 --> 00:02:33.736
But they would begin a life of grueling hardship

00:02:33.736 --> 00:02:36.740
and monotony.

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:39.439
They had no choice but to build a shack

00:02:39.439 --> 00:02:40.772
on the side of a muddy field,

00:02:40.772 --> 00:02:43.090
and this is Hany's brother Ashraf,

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:44.828
who plays outside.

00:02:44.828 --> 00:02:47.250
And that day, they joined

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:52.454
the biggest population of refugees in the world,

00:02:52.454 --> 00:02:55.480
in a country, Lebanon, that is tiny.

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:58.131
It only has four million citizens,

00:02:58.131 --> 00:03:01.701
and there are one million Syrian refugees living there.

00:03:01.701 --> 00:03:05.795
There's not a town, a city or a village

00:03:05.795 --> 00:03:10.542
that is not host to Syrian refugees.

00:03:10.542 --> 00:03:13.737
This is generosity and humanity

00:03:13.737 --> 00:03:18.111
that is remarkable.

00:03:18.111 --> 00:03:21.105
Think about it this way, proportionately.

00:03:21.105 --> 00:03:22.861
It would be as if

00:03:22.861 --> 00:03:25.852
the entire population of Germany,

00:03:25.852 --> 00:03:27.717
80 million people,

00:03:27.717 --> 00:03:33.107
would flee to the United States in just three years.

00:03:33.107 --> 00:03:36.268
Half of the entire population of Syria

00:03:36.268 --> 00:03:38.698
is now uprooted,

00:03:38.698 --> 00:03:40.453
most of them inside the country.

00:03:40.453 --> 00:03:42.748
Six and a half million people

00:03:42.748 --> 00:03:45.470
have fled for their lives.

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:48.360
Over and well over three million people

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:50.082
have crossed the borders

00:03:50.082 --> 00:03:53.625
and have found sanctuary
in the neighboring countries,

00:03:53.625 --> 00:03:56.550
and only a small proportion, as you see,

00:03:56.550 --> 00:04:00.684
have moved on to Europe.

00:04:00.684 --> 00:04:03.355
What I find most worrying

00:04:03.355 --> 00:04:07.281
is that half of all Syrian refugees are children.

00:04:07.281 --> 00:04:09.519
I took this picture of this little girl.

00:04:09.519 --> 00:04:12.444
It was just two hours after she had arrived

00:04:12.444 --> 00:04:16.786
after a long trek from Syria into Jordan.

00:04:16.786 --> 00:04:20.211
And most troubling of all

00:04:20.211 --> 00:04:23.952
is that only 20 percent of 
Syrian refugee children

00:04:23.952 --> 00:04:27.427
are in school in Lebanon.

00:04:27.427 --> 00:04:30.360
And yet, Syrian refugee children,

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:32.658
all refugee children tell us

00:04:32.658 --> 00:04:37.724
education is the most important thing in their lives.

00:04:37.724 --> 00:04:41.905
Why? Because it allows them to think of their future

00:04:41.905 --> 00:04:45.300
rather than the nightmare of their past.

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:50.934
It allows them to think of hope rather than hatred.

00:04:50.934 --> 00:04:52.963
I'm reminded of a recent visit I took

00:04:52.963 --> 00:04:56.540
to a Syrian refugee camp in northern Iraq,

00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:58.352
and I met this girl,

00:04:58.352 --> 00:05:00.129
and I thought, "She's beautiful,"

00:05:00.129 --> 00:05:01.836
and I went up to her and asked her,

00:05:01.836 --> 00:05:03.784
"Can I take your picture?"

00:05:03.784 --> 00:05:05.483
And she said yes,

00:05:05.483 --> 00:05:08.520
but she refused to smile.

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:11.569
I think she couldn't,

00:05:11.569 --> 00:05:15.075
because I think she must realize that she represents

00:05:15.075 --> 00:05:19.519
a lost generation of Syrian refugee children,

00:05:19.519 --> 00:05:24.100
a generation isolated and frustrated.

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:27.646
And yet, look at what they fled:

00:05:27.646 --> 00:05:29.485
utter destruction,

00:05:29.485 --> 00:05:35.064
buildings, industries, schools, roads, homes.

00:05:35.064 --> 00:05:37.743
Hany's home was also destroyed.

00:05:37.743 --> 00:05:40.956
This will need to be rebuilt

00:05:40.956 --> 00:05:45.787
by architects, by engineers, by electricians.

00:05:45.787 --> 00:05:49.434
Communities will need teachers and lawyers

00:05:49.434 --> 00:05:53.675
and politicians interested in reconciliation

00:05:53.675 --> 00:05:56.319
and not revenge.

00:05:56.319 --> 00:05:58.074
Shouldn't this be rebuilt

00:05:58.074 --> 00:06:01.165
by the people with the largest stake,

00:06:01.165 --> 00:06:07.030
the societies in exile, the refugees?

00:06:07.030 --> 00:06:09.784
Refugees have a lot of time

00:06:09.784 --> 00:06:12.030
to prepare for their return.

00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:14.745
You might imagine that being a refugee

00:06:14.745 --> 00:06:17.253
is just a temporary state.

00:06:17.253 --> 00:06:20.194
Well far from it.

00:06:20.194 --> 00:06:23.710
With wars going on and on,

00:06:23.710 --> 00:06:27.512
the average time a refugee will spend in exile

00:06:27.512 --> 00:06:30.977
is 17 years.

00:06:30.977 --> 00:06:34.565
Hany was into his second year in limbo

00:06:34.565 --> 00:06:36.939
when I went to visit him recently,

00:06:36.939 --> 00:06:40.696
and we conducted our entire conversation in English,

00:06:40.696 --> 00:06:42.585
which he confessed to me he learned

00:06:42.585 --> 00:06:46.239
from reading all of Dan Brown's novels

00:06:46.239 --> 00:06:50.594
and from listening to American rap.

00:06:50.594 --> 00:06:53.339
We also spent some nice moments of laughter

00:06:53.339 --> 00:06:57.973
and fun with his beloved brother Ashraf.

00:06:57.973 --> 00:06:59.594
But I'll never forget what he told me

00:06:59.594 --> 00:07:03.018
when we ended our conversation that day.

00:07:03.018 --> 00:07:05.431
He said to me,

00:07:05.431 --> 00:07:10.960
"If I am not a student, I am nothing."

00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:14.677
Hany is one of 50 million people

00:07:14.677 --> 00:07:18.255
uprooted in this world today.

00:07:18.255 --> 00:07:21.034
Never since World War II

00:07:21.034 --> 00:07:26.301
have so many people been forcibly displaced.

00:07:26.301 --> 00:07:28.930
So while we're making sweeping progress

00:07:28.930 --> 00:07:31.031
in human health,

00:07:31.031 --> 00:07:36.025
in technology, in education and design,

00:07:36.025 --> 00:07:39.388
we are doing dangerously little

00:07:39.388 --> 00:07:42.696
to help the victims

00:07:42.696 --> 00:07:45.395
and we are doing far too little

00:07:45.395 --> 00:07:47.431
to stop and prevent

00:07:47.431 --> 00:07:50.840
the wars that are driving them from their homes.

00:07:50.840 --> 00:07:55.283
And there are more and more victims.

00:07:55.283 --> 00:07:58.417
Every day, on average,

00:07:58.417 --> 00:08:00.599
by the end of this day,

00:08:00.599 --> 00:08:04.447
32,000 people will be forcibly displaced

00:08:04.447 --> 00:08:06.482
from their homes —

00:08:06.482 --> 00:08:09.394
32,000 people.

00:08:11.421 --> 00:08:15.170
They flee across borders like this one.

00:08:15.170 --> 00:08:18.865
We captured this on the Syrian border to Jordan,

00:08:18.865 --> 00:08:21.825
and this is a typical day.

00:08:25.738 --> 00:08:30.642
Or they flee on unseaworthy and overcrowded boats,

00:08:30.642 --> 00:08:32.442
risking their lives in this case

00:08:32.442 --> 00:08:35.073
just to reach safety in Europe.

00:08:35.073 --> 00:08:36.788
This Syrian young man

00:08:36.788 --> 00:08:39.574
survived one of these boats that capsized —

00:08:39.574 --> 00:08:41.197
most of the people drowned —

00:08:41.197 --> 00:08:43.412
and he told us,

00:08:43.412 --> 00:08:47.571
"Syrians are just looking for a quiet place

00:08:47.571 --> 00:08:50.440
where nobody hurts you,

00:08:50.440 --> 00:08:52.982
where nobody humiliates you,

00:08:52.982 --> 00:08:55.693
and where nobody kills you."

00:08:55.693 --> 00:08:58.911
Well, I think that should be the minimum.

00:08:58.911 --> 00:09:02.038
How about a place of healing,

00:09:02.038 --> 00:09:03.916
of learning,

00:09:03.916 --> 00:09:07.310
and even opportunity?

00:09:08.982 --> 00:09:11.006
Americans and Europeans

00:09:11.006 --> 00:09:14.257
have the impression that proportionally

00:09:14.257 --> 00:09:16.630
huge numbers of refugees are coming

00:09:16.630 --> 00:09:18.650
to their country,

00:09:18.650 --> 00:09:20.792
but the reality is

00:09:20.792 --> 00:09:24.437
that 86 percent, the vast majority of refugees,

00:09:24.437 --> 00:09:27.117
are living in the developing world,

00:09:27.117 --> 00:09:31.670
in countries struggling with their own insecurity,

00:09:31.670 --> 00:09:35.689
with their own issues of helping their own populations

00:09:35.689 --> 00:09:37.812
and poverty.

00:09:37.812 --> 00:09:41.085
So wealthy countries in the world should recognize

00:09:41.085 --> 00:09:44.786
the humanity and the generosity of the countries

00:09:44.786 --> 00:09:48.904
that are hosting so many refugees.

00:09:48.904 --> 00:09:52.536
And all countries should make sure that no one

00:09:52.536 --> 00:09:55.089
fleeing war and persecution

00:09:55.089 --> 00:09:58.802
arrives at a closed border.

00:09:58.802 --> 00:10:01.432
(Applause)

00:10:01.432 --> 00:10:04.669
Thank you.

00:10:06.350 --> 00:10:08.655
But there is something more that we can do

00:10:08.655 --> 00:10:13.065
than just simply helping refugees survive.

00:10:13.065 --> 00:10:16.596
We can help them thrive.

00:10:16.596 --> 00:10:19.656
We should think of refugee camps and communities

00:10:19.656 --> 00:10:23.863
as more than just temporary population centers

00:10:23.863 --> 00:10:26.023
where people languish

00:10:26.023 --> 00:10:28.932
waiting for the war to end.

00:10:28.932 --> 00:10:32.661
Rather, as centers of excellence,

00:10:32.661 --> 00:10:36.609
where refugees can triumph over their trauma

00:10:36.609 --> 00:10:39.793
and train for the day that they can go home

00:10:39.793 --> 00:10:42.874
as agents of positive change

00:10:42.874 --> 00:10:47.272
and social transformation.

00:10:47.272 --> 00:10:49.658
It makes so much sense,

00:10:49.658 --> 00:10:53.967
but I'm reminded of the terrible war in Somalia

00:10:53.967 --> 00:10:57.891
that has been raging on for 22 years.

00:10:57.891 --> 00:11:00.400
And imagine living in this camp.

00:11:00.400 --> 00:11:01.973
I visited this camp.

00:11:01.973 --> 00:11:03.850
It's in Djibouti, neighboring Somalia,

00:11:03.850 --> 00:11:06.394
and it was so remote

00:11:06.394 --> 00:11:08.835
that we had to take a helicopter to fly there.

00:11:08.835 --> 00:11:12.281
It was dusty and it was terribly hot.

00:11:12.281 --> 00:11:14.575
And we went to visit a school

00:11:14.575 --> 00:11:16.492
and started talking to the children,

00:11:16.492 --> 00:11:19.086
and then I saw this girl across the room

00:11:19.086 --> 00:11:20.935
who looked to me to be the same age

00:11:20.935 --> 00:11:24.216
as my own daughter, and I went up and talked to her.

00:11:24.216 --> 00:11:25.760
And I asked her the questions

00:11:25.760 --> 00:11:27.939
that grown-ups ask kids,

00:11:27.939 --> 00:11:29.862
like, "What is your favorite subject?"

00:11:29.862 --> 00:11:32.517
and, "What do you want to be when you grow up?"

00:11:32.517 --> 00:11:35.814
And this is when her face turned blank,

00:11:35.814 --> 00:11:37.864
and she said to me,

00:11:37.864 --> 00:11:40.335
"I have no future.

00:11:40.335 --> 00:11:43.312
My schooling days are over."

00:11:43.312 --> 00:11:44.960
And I thought, there must be some misunderstanding,

00:11:44.960 --> 00:11:47.269
so I turned to my colleague

00:11:47.269 --> 00:11:49.367
and she confirmed to me

00:11:49.367 --> 00:11:52.060
there is no funding for secondary education

00:11:52.060 --> 00:11:54.330
in this camp.

00:11:54.330 --> 00:11:55.799
And how I wished at that moment

00:11:55.799 --> 00:11:58.117
that I could say to her,

00:11:58.117 --> 00:12:00.522
"We will build you a school."

00:12:00.522 --> 00:12:04.696
And I also thought, what a waste.

00:12:04.696 --> 00:12:07.744
She should be and she is

00:12:07.744 --> 00:12:12.075
the future of Somalia.

00:12:12.075 --> 00:12:15.281
A boy named Jacob Atem

00:12:15.281 --> 00:12:18.476
had a different chance, but not before he experienced

00:12:18.476 --> 00:12:20.568
terribly tragedy.

00:12:20.568 --> 00:12:23.032
He watched — this is in Sudan —

00:12:23.032 --> 00:12:25.326
as his village — he was only seven years old —

00:12:25.326 --> 00:12:27.708
burned to the ground, and he learned

00:12:27.708 --> 00:12:29.547
that his mother and his father

00:12:29.547 --> 00:12:31.536
and his entire family

00:12:31.536 --> 00:12:33.400
were killed that day.

00:12:33.400 --> 00:12:35.190
Only his cousin survived, and the two of them

00:12:35.190 --> 00:12:37.470
walked for seven months —

00:12:37.470 --> 00:12:39.320
this is boys like him —

00:12:39.320 --> 00:12:42.528
chased and pursued by wild
animals and armed gangs,

00:12:42.528 --> 00:12:44.888
and they finally made it to refugee camps

00:12:44.888 --> 00:12:46.421
where they found safety,

00:12:46.421 --> 00:12:48.544
and he would spend the next seven years

00:12:48.544 --> 00:12:51.731
in Kenya in a refugee camp.

00:12:51.731 --> 00:12:54.259
But his life changed

00:12:54.259 --> 00:12:56.362
when he got the chance to be resettled

00:12:56.362 --> 00:12:58.567
to the United States,

00:12:58.567 --> 00:13:01.263
and he found love in a foster family

00:13:01.263 --> 00:13:03.851
and he was able to go to school,

00:13:03.851 --> 00:13:06.145
and he wanted me to share with you

00:13:06.145 --> 00:13:07.713
this proud moment

00:13:07.713 --> 00:13:10.018
when he graduated from university.

00:13:10.018 --> 00:13:13.960
(Applause)

00:13:15.979 --> 00:13:18.393
I spoke to him on Skype the other day,

00:13:18.393 --> 00:13:23.387
and he was in his new university in Florida

00:13:23.387 --> 00:13:26.386
pursuing his Ph.D. in public health,

00:13:26.386 --> 00:13:29.456
and he proudly told me how he was able to raise

00:13:29.456 --> 00:13:32.140
enough funds from the American public

00:13:32.140 --> 00:13:36.725
to establish a health clinic back in his village

00:13:36.725 --> 00:13:39.805
back home.

00:13:39.805 --> 00:13:43.089
So I want to take you back to Hany.

00:13:43.089 --> 00:13:45.310
When I told him I was going to have the chance

00:13:45.310 --> 00:13:48.027
to speak to you here on the TED stage,

00:13:48.027 --> 00:13:50.322
he allowed me to read you a poem

00:13:50.322 --> 00:13:53.682
that he sent in an email to me.

00:13:53.682 --> 00:13:56.599
He wrote:

00:13:57.420 --> 00:13:59.980
"I miss myself,

00:13:59.980 --> 00:14:02.485
my friends,

00:14:02.485 --> 00:14:06.740
times of reading novels or writing poems,

00:14:06.740 --> 00:14:11.665
birds and tea in the morning.

00:14:11.665 --> 00:14:16.614
My room, my books, myself,

00:14:16.614 --> 00:14:22.272
and everything that was making me smile.

00:14:22.272 --> 00:14:26.400
Oh, oh, I had so many dreams

00:14:26.400 --> 00:14:29.946
that were about to be realized."

00:14:31.473 --> 00:14:33.701
So here is my point:

00:14:33.701 --> 00:14:35.747
Not investing in refugees

00:14:35.747 --> 00:14:41.391
is a huge missed opportunity.

00:14:41.391 --> 00:14:43.242
Leave them abandoned,

00:14:43.242 --> 00:14:48.589
and they risk exploitation and abuse,

00:14:48.589 --> 00:14:51.862
and leave them unskilled and uneducated,

00:14:51.862 --> 00:14:54.415
and delay by years the return

00:14:54.415 --> 00:15:00.265
to peace and prosperity in their countries.

00:15:00.265 --> 00:15:03.549
I believe how we treat the uprooted

00:15:03.549 --> 00:15:08.122
will shape the future of our world.

00:15:08.122 --> 00:15:11.076
The victims of war can hold the keys

00:15:11.076 --> 00:15:13.597
to lasting peace,

00:15:13.597 --> 00:15:15.406
and it's the refugees

00:15:15.406 --> 00:15:19.073
who can stop the cycle of violence.

00:15:19.073 --> 00:15:22.094
Hany is at a tipping point.

00:15:22.094 --> 00:15:24.359
We would love to help him go to university

00:15:24.359 --> 00:15:27.419
and to become an engineer,

00:15:27.419 --> 00:15:31.266
but our funds are prioritized for the basics in life:

00:15:31.266 --> 00:15:35.313
tents and blankets and mattresses and kitchen sets,

00:15:35.313 --> 00:15:39.669
food rations and a bit of medicine.

00:15:39.669 --> 00:15:43.066
University is a luxury.

00:15:43.066 --> 00:15:47.403
But leave him to languish in this muddy field,

00:15:47.403 --> 00:15:49.364
and he will become a member

00:15:49.364 --> 00:15:52.786
of a lost generation.

00:15:52.786 --> 00:15:57.490
Hany's story is a tragedy,

00:15:57.490 --> 00:16:01.223
but it doesn't have to end that way.

00:16:01.223 --> 00:16:03.600
Thank you.

00:16:03.600 --> 00:16:07.195
(Applause)
