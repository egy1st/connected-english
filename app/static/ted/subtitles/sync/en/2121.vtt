WEBVTT

00:00:12.267 --> 00:00:15.919
So this is Anna Hazare,

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:19.827
and Anna Hazare may well be
the most cutting-edge

00:00:19.827 --> 00:00:23.064
digital activist in the world today.

00:00:23.064 --> 00:00:24.602
And you wouldn't know it by looking at him.

00:00:24.602 --> 00:00:30.249
Hazare is a 77-year-old Indian 
anticorruption and social justice activist.

00:00:30.249 --> 00:00:33.840
And in 2011, he was running a big campaign

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.800
to address everyday corruption in India,

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:39.671
a topic that Indian elites love to ignore.

00:00:39.671 --> 00:00:41.253
So as part of this campaign,

00:00:41.253 --> 00:00:43.175
he was using all of the traditional tactics

00:00:43.175 --> 00:00:45.391
that a good Gandhian organizer would use.

00:00:45.391 --> 00:00:47.447
So he was on a hunger strike,

00:00:47.447 --> 00:00:49.972
and Hazare realized through his hunger

00:00:49.972 --> 00:00:51.749
that actually maybe this time,

00:00:51.749 --> 00:00:53.495
in the 21st century,

00:00:53.495 --> 00:00:54.984
a hunger strike wouldn't be enough.

00:00:54.984 --> 00:00:59.276
So he started playing around 
with mobile activism.

00:00:59.276 --> 00:01:01.163
So the first thing he did 
is he said to people,

00:01:01.163 --> 00:01:03.234
"Okay, why don't you send me

00:01:03.234 --> 00:01:04.995
a text message if you support

00:01:04.995 --> 00:01:06.735
my campaign against corruption?"

00:01:06.735 --> 00:01:09.004
So he does this, he 
gives people a short code,

00:01:09.004 --> 00:01:11.620
and about 80,000 people do it.

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:13.588
Okay, that's pretty respectable.

00:01:13.588 --> 00:01:14.525
But then he decides,

00:01:14.525 --> 00:01:16.645
"Let me tweak my tactics a little bit."

00:01:16.645 --> 00:01:21.120
He says, "Why don't you leave
me a missed call?"

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:24.189
Now, for those of you who have
lived in the global South,

00:01:24.189 --> 00:01:25.681
you'll know that missed calls

00:01:25.681 --> 00:01:29.524
are a really critical part
of global mobile culture.

00:01:29.524 --> 00:01:30.638
I see people nodding.

00:01:30.638 --> 00:01:32.746
People leave missed calls all the time:

00:01:32.746 --> 00:01:34.692
If you're running late for a meeting

00:01:34.692 --> 00:01:36.998
and you just want to let them
know that you're on the way,

00:01:36.998 --> 00:01:38.721
you leave them a missed call.

00:01:38.721 --> 00:01:40.647
If you're dating someone and 
you just want to say "I miss you"

00:01:40.647 --> 00:01:42.033
you leave them a missed call.

00:01:42.033 --> 00:01:44.577
So a note for a dating tip here,

00:01:44.577 --> 00:01:45.702
in some cultures,

00:01:45.702 --> 00:01:46.984
if you want to please your lover,

00:01:46.984 --> 00:01:51.485
you call them and hang up.
(Laughter)

00:01:51.485 --> 00:01:54.840
So why do people leave missed calls?

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.290
Well, the reason of course is that

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:59.048
they're trying to avoid charges

00:01:59.048 --> 00:02:02.414
associated with making calls
and sending texts.

00:02:02.414 --> 00:02:06.470
So when Hazare asked people 
to leave him a missed call,

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:12.147
let's have a little guess how 
many people actually did this?

00:02:12.147 --> 00:02:15.565
Thirty-five million.

00:02:15.565 --> 00:02:19.608
So this is one of the largest coordinated
actions in human history.

00:02:19.608 --> 00:02:21.362
It's remarkable.

00:02:21.362 --> 00:02:25.862
And this reflects the extraordinary strength 
of the emerging Indian middle class

00:02:25.862 --> 00:02:28.834
and the power that their
mobile phones bring.

00:02:28.834 --> 00:02:30.419
But he used that,

00:02:30.419 --> 00:02:34.638
Hazare ended up with this massive 
CSV file of mobile phone numbers,

00:02:34.638 --> 00:02:36.423
and he used that to deploy

00:02:36.423 --> 00:02:38.419
real people power on the ground

00:02:38.419 --> 00:02:41.833
to get hundreds of thousands of
people out on the streets in Delhi

00:02:41.833 --> 00:02:46.183
to make a national point of 
everyday corruption in India.

00:02:46.183 --> 00:02:48.620
It's a really striking story.

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:50.830
So this is me when I was 12 years old.

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:52.542
I hope you see the resemblance.

00:02:52.542 --> 00:02:54.467
And I was also an activist,

00:02:54.467 --> 00:02:56.707
and I have been an activist all my life.

00:02:56.707 --> 00:02:58.037
I had this really funny childhood

00:02:58.037 --> 00:03:00.060
where I traipsed around the world

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:02.854
meeting world leaders and 
Noble prize winners,

00:03:02.854 --> 00:03:05.140
talking about Third World debt,

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:06.429
as it was then called,

00:03:06.429 --> 00:03:07.963
and demilitarization.

00:03:07.963 --> 00:03:12.195
I was a very, very serious child.
(Laughter)

00:03:12.195 --> 00:03:14.100
And back then,

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:15.534
in the early '90s,

00:03:15.534 --> 00:03:19.364
I had a very cutting-edge
tech tool of my own:

00:03:19.364 --> 00:03:21.616
the fax.

00:03:21.616 --> 00:03:23.794
And the fax was the 
tool of my activism.

00:03:23.794 --> 00:03:25.352
And at that time, it was the best way

00:03:25.352 --> 00:03:27.247
to get a message to a lot of people

00:03:27.247 --> 00:03:29.685
all at once.

00:03:29.685 --> 00:03:32.131
I'll give you one example of a fax
campaign that I ran.

00:03:32.131 --> 00:03:34.227
It was the eve of the Gulf War

00:03:34.227 --> 00:03:37.778
and I organized a global campaign 
to flood the hotel,

00:03:37.778 --> 00:03:39.259
the Intercontinental in Geneva,

00:03:39.259 --> 00:03:40.814
where James Baker and Tariq Aziz

00:03:40.814 --> 00:03:42.738
were meeting on the eve of the war,

00:03:42.738 --> 00:03:45.122
and I thought if I could 
flood them with faxes,

00:03:45.122 --> 00:03:46.200
we'll stop the war.

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:48.393
Well, unsurprisingly,

00:03:48.393 --> 00:03:51.984
that campaign was wholly unsuccessful.

00:03:51.984 --> 00:03:53.638
There are lots of reasons for that,

00:03:53.638 --> 00:03:56.123
but there's no doubt that 
one sputtering fax machine

00:03:56.123 --> 00:03:59.450
in Geneva was a little bit
of a bandwidth constraint

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:02.292
in terms of the ability to 
get a message to lots of people.

00:04:02.292 --> 00:04:06.322
And so, I went on to 
discover some better tools.

00:04:06.322 --> 00:04:08.964
I cofounded Avaaz, which uses the 
Internet to mobilize people

00:04:08.964 --> 00:04:11.562
and now has almost 
40 million members,

00:04:11.562 --> 00:04:14.122
and I now run Purpose, which 
is a home for these kinds of

00:04:14.122 --> 00:04:16.418
technology-powered movements.

00:04:16.418 --> 00:04:18.238
So what's the moral of this story?

00:04:18.238 --> 00:04:19.746
Is the moral of this story,

00:04:19.746 --> 00:04:24.855
you know what, the fax is kind of
eclipsed by the mobile phone?

00:04:24.855 --> 00:04:27.085
This is another story of 
tech-determinism?

00:04:27.085 --> 00:04:30.275
Well, I would argue that there's 
actually more to it than that.

00:04:30.275 --> 00:04:32.948
I'd argue that in the last 20 years,

00:04:32.948 --> 00:04:35.186
something more fundamental has changed

00:04:35.186 --> 00:04:36.891
than just new tech.

00:04:36.891 --> 00:04:39.711
I would argue that there has
been a fundamental shift

00:04:39.711 --> 00:04:41.859
in the balance of power

00:04:41.859 --> 00:04:43.378
in the world.

00:04:43.378 --> 00:04:45.295
You ask any activist how 
to understand the world,

00:04:45.295 --> 00:04:47.769
and they'll say,
"Look at where the power is,

00:04:47.769 --> 00:04:50.227
who has it, how it's shifting."

00:04:50.227 --> 00:04:53.229
And I think we all sense that 
something big is happening.

00:04:53.229 --> 00:04:55.673
So Henry Timms and I —

00:04:55.673 --> 00:04:57.521
Henry's a fellow movement builder —

00:04:57.521 --> 00:04:59.423
got talking one day and 
we started to think,

00:04:59.423 --> 00:05:01.424
how can we make sense of this new world?

00:05:01.424 --> 00:05:02.613
How can we describe it and give

00:05:02.613 --> 00:05:05.056
it a framework that makes it more useful?

00:05:05.056 --> 00:05:06.286
Because we realized that many

00:05:06.286 --> 00:05:09.100
of the lessons that we were
discovering in movements

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:11.807
actually applied all over the world

00:05:11.807 --> 00:05:13.929
in many sectors of our society.

00:05:13.929 --> 00:05:15.806
So I want to introduce you to
this framework:

00:05:15.806 --> 00:05:18.026
Old power, meet new power.

00:05:18.026 --> 00:05:21.457
And I want to talk to you about
what new power is today.

00:05:21.457 --> 00:05:23.421
New power is the deployment

00:05:23.421 --> 00:05:26.610
of mass participation 
and peer coordination —

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:28.252
these are the two key elements —

00:05:28.252 --> 00:05:30.749
to create change and shift outcomes.

00:05:30.749 --> 00:05:33.837
And we see new power all around us.

00:05:33.837 --> 00:05:35.121
This is Beppe Grillo

00:05:35.121 --> 00:05:37.266
he was a populist Italian blogger

00:05:37.266 --> 00:05:40.686
who, with a minimal political apparatus
and only some online tools,

00:05:40.686 --> 00:05:43.184
won more than 25 percent of the vote

00:05:43.184 --> 00:05:45.605
in recent Italian elections.

00:05:45.605 --> 00:05:46.967
This is Airbnb,

00:05:46.967 --> 00:05:48.716
which in just a few years

00:05:48.716 --> 00:05:50.878
has radically disrupted the hotel industry

00:05:50.878 --> 00:05:53.796
without owning a single
square foot of real estate.

00:05:53.796 --> 00:05:55.151
This is Kickstarter,

00:05:55.151 --> 00:05:58.048
which we know has raised over a billion dollars

00:05:58.048 --> 00:06:00.469
from more than five million people.

00:06:00.469 --> 00:06:02.399
Now, we're familiar with all of these models.

00:06:02.399 --> 00:06:05.600
But what's striking is the commonalities,

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:07.726
the structural features of 
these new models

00:06:07.726 --> 00:06:09.875
and how they differ from old power.

00:06:09.875 --> 00:06:11.544
Let's look a little bit at this.

00:06:11.544 --> 00:06:14.702
Old power is held like a currency.

00:06:14.702 --> 00:06:16.681
New power works like a current.

00:06:16.681 --> 00:06:19.183
Old power is held by a few.

00:06:19.183 --> 00:06:22.623
New power isn't held by a few,
it's made by many.

00:06:22.623 --> 00:06:25.130
Old power is all about download,

00:06:25.130 --> 00:06:26.856
and new power uploads.

00:06:26.856 --> 00:06:29.390
And you see a whole set of 
characteristics that you can trace,

00:06:29.390 --> 00:06:32.506
whether it's in media or 
politics or education.

00:06:32.506 --> 00:06:34.572
So we've talked a little bit 
about what new power is.

00:06:34.572 --> 00:06:37.737
Let's, for a second, talk about 
what new power isn't.

00:06:37.737 --> 00:06:41.533
New power is not your Facebook page.

00:06:41.533 --> 00:06:44.358
I assure you that having a 
social media strategy

00:06:44.358 --> 00:06:46.906
can enable you to do just as much download

00:06:46.906 --> 00:06:49.768
as you used to do when you had the radio.

00:06:49.768 --> 00:06:53.296
Just ask Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad,

00:06:53.296 --> 00:06:55.038
I assure you that his Facebook page

00:06:55.038 --> 00:06:59.165
has not embraced the power
of participation.

00:06:59.165 --> 00:07:02.563
New power is not inherently positive.

00:07:02.563 --> 00:07:04.852
In fact, this isn't an normative
argument that we're making,

00:07:04.852 --> 00:07:06.664
there are many good things 
about new power,

00:07:06.664 --> 00:07:08.481
but it can produce bad outcomes.

00:07:08.481 --> 00:07:10.486
More participation, more peer coordination,

00:07:10.486 --> 00:07:12.273
sometimes distorts outcomes

00:07:12.273 --> 00:07:13.348
and there are some things,

00:07:13.348 --> 00:07:15.447
like things, for example, 
in the medical profession

00:07:15.447 --> 00:07:18.443
that we want new power 
to get nowhere near.

00:07:18.443 --> 00:07:21.446
And thirdly, new power is not
the inevitable victor.

00:07:21.446 --> 00:07:23.025
In fact, unsurprisingly,

00:07:23.025 --> 00:07:26.014
as many of these new power
models get to scale,

00:07:26.014 --> 00:07:28.484
what you see is this massive pushback

00:07:28.484 --> 00:07:30.233
from the forces of old power.

00:07:30.233 --> 00:07:32.442
Just look at this really 
interesting epic struggle

00:07:32.442 --> 00:07:36.825
going on right now between 
Edward Snowden and the NSA.

00:07:36.825 --> 00:07:39.209
You'll note that only one of 
the two people on this slide

00:07:39.209 --> 00:07:41.388
is currently in exile.

00:07:41.388 --> 00:07:42.803
And so, it's not at all clear

00:07:42.803 --> 00:07:44.893
that new power will be 
the inevitable victor.

00:07:44.893 --> 00:07:47.836
That said, keep one thing in mind:

00:07:47.836 --> 00:07:50.725
We're at the beginning of a
very steep curve.

00:07:50.725 --> 00:07:52.366
So you think about some of 
these new power models, right?

00:07:52.366 --> 00:07:54.478
These were just like someone's

00:07:54.478 --> 00:07:57.024
garage idea a few years ago,

00:07:57.024 --> 00:08:00.160
and now they're disrupting 
entire industries.

00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:02.829
And so, what's interesting
about new power,

00:08:02.829 --> 00:08:04.845
is the way it feeds
on itself.

00:08:04.845 --> 00:08:06.869
Once you have an experience of new power,

00:08:06.869 --> 00:08:09.059
you tend to expect and 
want more of it.

00:08:09.059 --> 00:08:11.939
So let's say you've used a
peer-to-peer lending platform

00:08:11.939 --> 00:08:14.473
like Lending Tree or Prosper,

00:08:14.473 --> 00:08:16.757
then you've figured out that
you don't need the bank,

00:08:16.757 --> 00:08:18.694
and who wants the bank, right?

00:08:18.694 --> 00:08:21.132
And so, that experience tends 
to embolden you

00:08:21.132 --> 00:08:24.069
it tends to make you want
more participation

00:08:24.069 --> 00:08:26.414
across more aspects of your life.

00:08:26.414 --> 00:08:27.959
And what this gives rise to is

00:08:27.959 --> 00:08:29.530
a set of values.

00:08:29.530 --> 00:08:30.840
We talked about the models

00:08:30.840 --> 00:08:32.434
that new power has engendered —

00:08:32.434 --> 00:08:34.266
the Airbnbs, the Kickstarters.

00:08:34.266 --> 00:08:35.795
What about the values?

00:08:35.795 --> 00:08:37.465
And this is an early sketch

00:08:37.465 --> 00:08:40.028
at what new power values look like.

00:08:40.028 --> 00:08:43.159
New power values prize
transparency above all else.

00:08:43.159 --> 00:08:45.381
It's almost a religious 
belief in transparency,

00:08:45.381 --> 00:08:47.645
a belief that if you shine 
a light on something,

00:08:47.645 --> 00:08:49.076
it will be better.

00:08:49.076 --> 00:08:51.826
And remember that in the 20th 
century, this was not at all true.

00:08:51.826 --> 00:08:54.793
People thought that gentlemen
should sit behind closed doors

00:08:54.793 --> 00:08:57.075
and make comfortable agreements.

00:08:57.075 --> 00:09:00.480
New power values of informal,
networked governance.

00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:03.124
New power folks would never 
have invented the U.N. today,

00:09:03.124 --> 00:09:04.957
for better or worse.

00:09:04.957 --> 00:09:06.672
New power values participation,

00:09:06.672 --> 00:09:09.467
and new power is all about do-it-yourself.

00:09:09.467 --> 00:09:10.956
In fact, what's interesting 
about new power

00:09:10.956 --> 00:09:14.669
is that it eschews some of 
the professionalization

00:09:14.669 --> 00:09:16.144
and specialization that was

00:09:16.144 --> 00:09:18.534
all the rage in the 20th century.

00:09:18.534 --> 00:09:20.344
So what's interesting about these

00:09:20.344 --> 00:09:22.310
new power values and these
new power models

00:09:22.310 --> 00:09:24.605
is what they mean for organizations.

00:09:24.605 --> 00:09:27.113
So we've spent a bit of time thinking,

00:09:27.113 --> 00:09:29.379
how can we plot organizations

00:09:29.379 --> 00:09:31.643
on a two-by-two where, essentially,

00:09:31.643 --> 00:09:33.699
we look at new power values

00:09:33.699 --> 00:09:34.963
and new power models

00:09:34.963 --> 00:09:36.764
and see where different people sit?

00:09:36.764 --> 00:09:38.653
We started with a U.S. analysis,

00:09:38.653 --> 00:09:41.029
and let me show you 
some interesting findings.

00:09:41.029 --> 00:09:43.008
So the first is Apple.

00:09:43.008 --> 00:09:45.543
In this framework, we actually
described Apple

00:09:45.543 --> 00:09:47.665
as an old power company.

00:09:47.665 --> 00:09:49.319
That's because the ideology,

00:09:49.319 --> 00:09:51.607
the governing ideology of Apple

00:09:51.607 --> 00:09:54.481
is the ideology of the perfectionist

00:09:54.481 --> 00:09:56.505
product designer in Cupertino.

00:09:56.505 --> 00:10:00.577
It's absolutely about that beautiful, 
perfect thing descending upon us

00:10:00.577 --> 00:10:01.928
in perfection.

00:10:01.928 --> 00:10:04.551
And it does not value, as a 
company, transparency.

00:10:04.551 --> 00:10:06.214
In fact, it's very secretive.

00:10:06.214 --> 00:10:09.040
Now, Apple is one of the most
succesful companies in the world.

00:10:09.040 --> 00:10:10.412
So this shows that you can

00:10:10.412 --> 00:10:13.101
still pursue a successful 
old power strategy.

00:10:13.101 --> 00:10:16.071
But one can argue that there's 
real vulnerabilites in that model.

00:10:16.071 --> 00:10:18.095
I think another interesting comparison

00:10:18.095 --> 00:10:20.272
is that of the Obama campaign

00:10:20.272 --> 00:10:23.388
versus the Obama presidency.

00:10:23.388 --> 00:10:30.850
(Applause)

00:10:30.850 --> 00:10:32.597
Now, I like President Obama,

00:10:32.597 --> 00:10:36.553
but he ran with new 
power at his back, right?

00:10:36.553 --> 00:10:38.380
And he said to people,

00:10:38.380 --> 00:10:40.353
we are the ones we've
been waiting for.

00:10:40.353 --> 00:10:41.804
And he used crowdfunding

00:10:41.804 --> 00:10:43.015
to power a campaign.

00:10:43.015 --> 00:10:44.416
But when he got into office,

00:10:44.416 --> 00:10:47.608
he governed like more or less 
all the other presidents did.

00:10:47.608 --> 00:10:49.972
And this is a really interesting trend,

00:10:49.972 --> 00:10:51.970
is when new power gets powerful,

00:10:51.970 --> 00:10:53.541
what happens?

00:10:53.541 --> 00:10:55.305
So this is a framework you 
should look at

00:10:55.305 --> 00:10:56.797
and think about where your
own organization

00:10:56.797 --> 00:10:57.761
sits on it.

00:10:57.761 --> 00:10:59.334
And think about where it
should be 

00:10:59.334 --> 00:11:00.882
in five or 10 years.

00:11:00.882 --> 00:11:03.347
So what do you do if you're old power?

00:11:03.347 --> 00:11:06.312
Well, if you're there 
thinking, in old power,

00:11:06.312 --> 00:11:08.212
this won't happen to us.

00:11:08.212 --> 00:11:13.379
Then just look at the Wikipedia
entry for Encyclopædia Britannica.

00:11:13.379 --> 00:11:15.775
Let me tell you, it's a very sad read.

00:11:15.775 --> 00:11:17.194
But if you are old power,

00:11:17.194 --> 00:11:20.987
the most important thing you 
can do is to occupy yourself

00:11:20.987 --> 00:11:23.641
before others occupy you,

00:11:23.641 --> 00:11:24.969
before you are occupied.

00:11:24.969 --> 00:11:27.742
Imagine that a group
of your biggest skeptics

00:11:27.742 --> 00:11:30.094
are camped in the heart
of your organization

00:11:30.094 --> 00:11:31.973
asking the toughest questions

00:11:31.973 --> 00:11:34.901
and they can see everything
inside of your organization.

00:11:34.901 --> 00:11:37.651
And ask them, would they 
like what they see

00:11:37.651 --> 00:11:39.926
and should our model change?

00:11:39.926 --> 00:11:41.789
What about if you're new power?

00:11:41.789 --> 00:11:44.423
Is new power kind of just 
riding the wave to glory?

00:11:44.423 --> 00:11:45.903
I would argue no.

00:11:45.903 --> 00:11:47.859
I would argue that there
are some very real challenges

00:11:47.859 --> 00:11:49.551
to new power in this nascent phase.

00:11:49.551 --> 00:11:53.053
Let's stick with the Occupy Wall Street
example for a moment.

00:11:53.053 --> 00:11:56.043
Occupy was this incredible example 
of new power,

00:11:56.043 --> 00:11:57.886
the purest example of new power.

00:11:57.886 --> 00:12:00.417
And yet, it failed to consolidate.

00:12:00.417 --> 00:12:02.314
So the energy that it created

00:12:02.314 --> 00:12:03.755
was great for the meme phase,

00:12:03.755 --> 00:12:06.556
but they were so committed to participation,

00:12:06.556 --> 00:12:08.190
that they never got anything done.

00:12:08.190 --> 00:12:09.981
And in fact that model

00:12:09.981 --> 00:12:12.773
means that the challenge for new power is:

00:12:12.773 --> 00:12:15.312
how do you use institutional power

00:12:15.312 --> 00:12:17.383
without being institutionalized?

00:12:17.383 --> 00:12:20.016
One the other end of the spectra is Uber.

00:12:20.016 --> 00:12:21.400
Uber is an amazing,

00:12:21.400 --> 00:12:23.453
highly scalable new power model.

00:12:23.453 --> 00:12:25.479
That network is getting denser and denser

00:12:25.479 --> 00:12:26.739
by the day.

00:12:26.739 --> 00:12:28.898
But what's really interesting 
about Uber is

00:12:28.898 --> 00:12:32.639
it hasn't really adopted new power values.

00:12:32.639 --> 00:12:36.711
This is a real quote from 
the Uber CEO recently:

00:12:36.711 --> 00:12:41.159
He says, "Once we get rid of the dude 
in the car" — he means drivers —

00:12:41.159 --> 00:12:45.051
"Uber will be cheaper."

00:12:45.051 --> 00:12:48.026
Now, new power models
live and die

00:12:48.026 --> 00:12:50.208
by the strength of their networks.

00:12:50.208 --> 00:12:52.141
By whether the drivers and the consumers

00:12:52.141 --> 00:12:54.482
who use the service actually believe in it.

00:12:54.482 --> 00:12:57.983
Because they're not an exercise 
of top-down perfectionism,

00:12:57.983 --> 00:12:59.931
they are about the network.

00:12:59.931 --> 00:13:01.627
And so, the challenge,

00:13:01.627 --> 00:13:03.877
and this is why it's in
no way surprising,

00:13:03.877 --> 00:13:08.133
is that Uber's drivers 
are now unionizing.

00:13:08.133 --> 00:13:09.733
It's extraordinary.

00:13:09.733 --> 00:13:12.022
Uber's drivers are turning on Uber.

00:13:12.022 --> 00:13:13.316
And the challenge for Uber —

00:13:13.316 --> 00:13:15.243
this isn't an easy situation for them —

00:13:15.243 --> 00:13:18.539
is that they are locked into
a broader superstrcuture

00:13:18.539 --> 00:13:20.224
that is really old power.

00:13:20.224 --> 00:13:23.232
They've raised more than a billion 
dollars in the capital markets.

00:13:23.232 --> 00:13:25.760
Those markets expect a financial return,

00:13:25.760 --> 00:13:27.677
and they way you get a financial return

00:13:27.677 --> 00:13:30.074
is by squeezing and squeezing

00:13:30.074 --> 00:13:32.319
your users and your drivers

00:13:32.319 --> 00:13:33.614
for more and more value

00:13:33.614 --> 00:13:36.081
and giving that value to your investors.

00:13:36.081 --> 00:13:39.684
So the big question about the future 
of new power, in my view, is:

00:13:39.684 --> 00:13:42.243
Will that old power just emerge?

00:13:42.243 --> 00:13:44.026
So will new power elites just become

00:13:44.026 --> 00:13:45.915
old power and squeeze?

00:13:45.915 --> 00:13:48.528
Or will that new power
base bite back?

00:13:48.528 --> 00:13:50.289
Will the next big Uber

00:13:50.289 --> 00:13:52.669
be co-owned by Uber drivers?

00:13:52.669 --> 00:13:55.452
And I think this going 
to be a very interesting

00:13:55.452 --> 00:13:57.354
structural question.

00:13:57.354 --> 00:14:00.636
Finally, think about new power

00:14:00.636 --> 00:14:03.003
being more than just an

00:14:03.003 --> 00:14:04.639
entity that scales things 

00:14:04.639 --> 00:14:08.355
that make us have slightly 
better consumer experiences.

00:14:08.355 --> 00:14:10.521
My call to action for new power

00:14:10.521 --> 00:14:12.929
is to not be an island.

00:14:12.929 --> 00:14:16.085
We have major structural
problems in the world today

00:14:16.085 --> 00:14:18.341
that could benefit enormously

00:14:18.341 --> 00:14:20.655
from the kinds of mass participation

00:14:20.655 --> 00:14:21.992
and peer coordination

00:14:21.992 --> 00:14:23.720
that these new power players

00:14:23.720 --> 00:14:26.116
know so well how to generate.

00:14:26.116 --> 00:14:29.629
And we badly need them to 
turn their energies and their power

00:14:29.629 --> 00:14:32.853
to big, what economists might call

00:14:32.853 --> 00:14:34.426
public goods problems,

00:14:34.426 --> 00:14:36.472
that are often beyond markets

00:14:36.472 --> 00:14:38.482
where investors can easily be found.

00:14:38.482 --> 00:14:40.372
And I think if we can do that,

00:14:40.372 --> 00:14:43.357
we might be able to fundamentally change

00:14:43.357 --> 00:14:46.888
not only human beings' sense of 
their own agency and power —

00:14:46.888 --> 00:14:49.746
because I think that's the most
wonderful thing about new power,

00:14:49.746 --> 00:14:52.498
is that people feel more powerful —

00:14:52.498 --> 00:14:54.279
but we might also be able to change

00:14:54.279 --> 00:14:56.042
the way we relate to each other

00:14:56.042 --> 00:14:59.153
and the way we relate to 
authority and institutions.

00:14:59.153 --> 00:15:01.201
And to me, that's absolutely

00:15:01.201 --> 00:15:02.772
worth trying for.

00:15:02.772 --> 00:15:03.868
Thank you very much.

00:15:03.868 --> 00:15:05.960
(Applause)
