00:00:13.422 --> 00:00:14.799
Picture this:

00:00:14.799 --> 00:00:15.892
It's Monday morning,

00:00:15.892 --> 00:00:17.011
you're at the office,

00:00:17.011 --> 00:00:18.765
you're settling in for the day at work,

00:00:18.765 --> 00:00:21.587
and this guy that you sort of 
recognize from down the hall,

00:00:21.587 --> 00:00:23.423
walks right into your cubicle

00:00:23.423 --> 00:00:24.825
and he steals your chair.

00:00:24.825 --> 00:00:26.067
Doesn't say a word —

00:00:26.067 --> 00:00:27.455
just rolls away with it.

00:00:27.455 --> 00:00:29.938
Doesn't give you any information
about why he took your chair

00:00:29.938 --> 00:00:32.049
out of all the other chairs 
that are out there.

00:00:32.049 --> 00:00:34.191
Doesn't acknowledge the fact 
that you might need your chair

00:00:34.191 --> 00:00:35.732
to get some work done today.

00:00:35.732 --> 00:00:37.989
You wouldn't stand for 
it. You'd make a stink.

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:40.016
You'd follow that guy
back to his cubicle

00:00:40.016 --> 00:00:43.328
and you'd say, "Why my chair?"

00:00:43.328 --> 00:00:47.449
Okay, so now it's Tuesday morning
and you're at the office,

00:00:47.449 --> 00:00:50.178
and a meeting invitation pops 
up in your calendar.

00:00:50.178 --> 00:00:51.783
(Laughter)

00:00:51.783 --> 00:00:54.859
And it's from this woman who you 
kind of know from down the hall,

00:00:54.859 --> 00:00:58.664
and the subject line references some 
project that you heard a little bit about.

00:00:58.664 --> 00:01:00.347
But there's no agenda.

00:01:00.347 --> 00:01:03.423
There's no information about why
you were invited to the meeting.

00:01:03.423 --> 00:01:08.039
And yet you accept the 
meeting invitation, and you go.

00:01:08.039 --> 00:01:10.966
And when this highly 
unproductive session is over,

00:01:10.966 --> 00:01:12.649
you go back to your desk,

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:14.158
and you stand at your 
desk and you say,

00:01:14.158 --> 00:01:16.821
"Boy, I wish I had those two hours back,

00:01:16.821 --> 00:01:18.824
like I wish I had my chair back."

00:01:18.824 --> 00:01:20.330
(Laughter)

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:22.901
Every day, we allow our coworkers,

00:01:22.901 --> 00:01:25.115
who are otherwise very, 
very nice people,

00:01:25.115 --> 00:01:26.782
to steal from us.

00:01:26.782 --> 00:01:30.860
And I'm talking about something far 
more valuable than office furniture.

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:33.889
I'm talking about time. Your time.

00:01:33.889 --> 00:01:36.542
In fact, I believe that

00:01:36.542 --> 00:01:39.027
we are in the middle
of a global epidemic

00:01:39.027 --> 00:01:44.067
of a terrible new illness
known as MAS:

00:01:44.067 --> 00:01:46.340
Mindless Accept Syndrome.

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:48.234
(Laughter)

00:01:48.234 --> 00:01:50.935
The primary symptom of 
Mindless Accept Syndrome

00:01:50.935 --> 00:01:54.855
is just accepting a meeting invitation
the minute it pops up in your calendar.

00:01:54.855 --> 00:01:56.125
(Laughter)

00:01:56.125 --> 00:01:59.793
It's an involuntary reflex — ding, 
click, bing — it's in your calendar,

00:01:59.793 --> 00:02:03.086
"Gotta go, I'm already late 
for a meeting." (Laughter)

00:02:03.086 --> 00:02:05.473
Meetings are important, right?

00:02:05.473 --> 00:02:08.419
And collaboration is key to 
the success of any enterprise.

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:11.812
And a well-run meeting can yield 
really positive, actionable results.

00:02:11.812 --> 00:02:13.570
But between globalization

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:15.885
and pervasive information technology,

00:02:15.885 --> 00:02:17.556
the way that we work

00:02:17.556 --> 00:02:20.785
has really changed dramatically 
over the last few years.

00:02:20.785 --> 00:02:23.992
And we're miserable. (Laughter)

00:02:23.992 --> 00:02:27.532
And we're miserable not because the 
other guy can't run a good meeting,

00:02:27.532 --> 00:02:30.344
it's because of MAS, our 
Mindless Accept Syndrome,

00:02:30.344 --> 00:02:34.120
which is a self-inflicted wound.

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:39.267
Actually, I have evidence to prove
that MAS is a global epidemic.

00:02:39.267 --> 00:02:40.914
Let me tell you why.

00:02:40.914 --> 00:02:45.186
A couple of years ago, I put a video 
on Youtube, and in the video,

00:02:45.186 --> 00:02:48.384
I acted out every terrible 
conference call you've ever been on.

00:02:48.384 --> 00:02:50.043
It goes on for about five minutes,

00:02:50.043 --> 00:02:53.234
and it has all the things that we 
hate about really bad meetings.

00:02:53.234 --> 00:02:56.577
There's the moderator who has 
no idea how to run the meeting.

00:02:56.577 --> 00:02:59.135
There are the participants who 
have no idea why they're there.

00:02:59.135 --> 00:03:02.838
The whole thing kind of collapses
into this collaborative train wreck.

00:03:02.838 --> 00:03:05.264
And everybody leaves very angry.

00:03:05.264 --> 00:03:07.053
It's kind of funny.

00:03:07.053 --> 00:03:08.636
(Laughter)

00:03:08.636 --> 00:03:10.788
Let's take a quick look.

00:03:10.788 --> 00:03:14.615
(Video) Our goal today is to come to an 
agreement on a very important proposal.

00:03:14.615 --> 00:03:16.702
As a group, we need to decide if —

00:03:16.702 --> 00:03:19.481
bloop bloop —

00:03:19.481 --> 00:03:23.048
Hi, who just joined?

00:03:23.048 --> 00:03:26.060
Hi, it's Joe. I'm working from home today.

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:27.950
(Laughter)

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:31.018
Hi, Joe. Thanks for 
joining us today, great.

00:03:31.018 --> 00:03:33.808
I was just saying, we have a lot of people 
on the call we'd like to get through,

00:03:33.808 --> 00:03:35.442
so let's skip the roll call 

00:03:35.442 --> 00:03:38.115
and I'm gonna dive right in.

00:03:38.115 --> 00:03:41.990
Our goal today is to come to an 
agreement on a very important proposal.

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:44.555
As a group, we need to decide if —

00:03:44.555 --> 00:03:45.848
bloop bloop —

00:03:45.848 --> 00:03:47.311
(Laughter)

00:03:47.311 --> 00:03:49.334
Hi, who just joined?

00:03:49.334 --> 00:03:54.143
No? I thought I heard a beep. (Laughter)

00:03:54.143 --> 00:03:55.779
Sound familiar?

00:03:55.779 --> 00:03:57.756
Yeah, it sounds familiar 
to me, too.

00:03:57.756 --> 00:03:59.812
A couple of weeks after I put that online,

00:03:59.812 --> 00:04:02.613
500,000 people in dozens of countries,

00:04:02.613 --> 00:04:04.253
I mean dozens of countries,

00:04:04.253 --> 00:04:05.437
watched this video.

00:04:05.437 --> 00:04:08.791
And three years later, it's still getting 
thousands of views every month.

00:04:08.791 --> 00:04:10.758
It's close to about a million right now.

00:04:10.758 --> 00:04:12.766
And in fact, some of the biggest
companies in the world,

00:04:12.766 --> 00:04:14.676
companies that you've 
heard of but I won't name,

00:04:14.676 --> 00:04:18.571
have asked for my permission to use 
this video in their new-hire training

00:04:18.571 --> 00:04:22.820
to teach their new employees how 
not to run a meeting at their company.

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:24.305
And if the numbers —

00:04:24.305 --> 00:04:26.686
there are a million views and it's
being used by all these companies —

00:04:26.686 --> 00:04:30.212
aren't enough proof that we have 
a global problem with meetings,

00:04:30.212 --> 00:04:31.989
there are the many, many thousands

00:04:31.989 --> 00:04:33.609
of comments posted online

00:04:33.609 --> 00:04:35.797
after the video went up.

00:04:35.797 --> 00:04:37.771
Thousands of people wrote things like,

00:04:37.771 --> 00:04:39.625
"OMG, that was my day today!"

00:04:39.625 --> 00:04:41.588
"That was my day every day!"

00:04:41.588 --> 00:04:42.747
"This is my life."

00:04:42.747 --> 00:04:43.677
One guy wrote,

00:04:43.677 --> 00:04:45.216
"It's funny because it's true.

00:04:45.216 --> 00:04:47.123
Eerily, sadly, depressingly true.

00:04:47.123 --> 00:04:48.841
It made me laugh until I cried.

00:04:48.841 --> 00:04:51.591
And cried. And I cried some more."

00:04:51.591 --> 00:04:53.223
(Laughter)

00:04:53.223 --> 00:04:54.684
This poor guy said,

00:04:54.684 --> 00:04:59.761
"My daily life until 
retirement or death, sigh."

00:04:59.761 --> 00:05:01.161
These are real quotes

00:05:01.161 --> 00:05:02.960
and it's real sad.

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:05.783
A common theme running through
all of these comments online

00:05:05.783 --> 00:05:08.324
is this fundamental belief 
that we are powerless

00:05:08.324 --> 00:05:10.225
to do anything other 
than go to meetings

00:05:10.225 --> 00:05:12.603
and suffer through these 
poorly run meetings

00:05:12.603 --> 00:05:14.692
and live to meet another day.

00:05:14.692 --> 00:05:17.833
But the truth is, we're 
not powerless at all.

00:05:17.833 --> 00:05:20.926
In fact, the cure for MAS
is right here in our hands.

00:05:20.942 --> 00:05:23.127
It's right at our fingertips, literally.

00:05:23.127 --> 00:05:26.388
It's something that I call ¡No MAS!

00:05:26.388 --> 00:05:28.618
(Laughter)

00:05:28.618 --> 00:05:31.016
Which, if I remember my 
high school Spanish,

00:05:31.016 --> 00:05:33.807
means something like, 
"Enough already, make it stop!"

00:05:33.807 --> 00:05:36.559
Here's how No MAS 
works. It's very simple.

00:05:36.559 --> 00:05:39.756
First of all, the next time you 
get a meeting invitation

00:05:39.756 --> 00:05:42.603
that doesn't have a lot 
of information in it at all,

00:05:42.603 --> 00:05:44.443
click the tentative button!

00:05:44.443 --> 00:05:46.893
It's okay, you're allowed, 
that's why it's there.

00:05:46.893 --> 00:05:48.402
It's right next to the accept button.

00:05:48.402 --> 00:05:51.996
Or the maybe button, or whatever button 
is there for you not to accept immediately.

00:05:51.996 --> 00:05:55.779
Then, get in touch with the person
who asked you to the meeting.

00:05:55.779 --> 00:05:58.365
Tell them you're very excited 
to support their work,

00:05:58.365 --> 00:06:00.380
ask them what the goal 
of the meeting is,

00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:04.067
and tell them you're interested in learning 
how you can help them achieve their goal.

00:06:04.067 --> 00:06:05.995
And if we do this often enough,

00:06:05.995 --> 00:06:07.333
and we do it respectfully,

00:06:07.333 --> 00:06:09.370
people might start to be 
a little bit more thoughtful

00:06:09.370 --> 00:06:11.832
about the way they put together
meeting invitations.

00:06:11.832 --> 00:06:14.684
And you can make more thoughtful 
decisions about accepting it.

00:06:14.684 --> 00:06:17.944
People might actually start 
sending out agendas. Imagine!

00:06:17.944 --> 00:06:21.692
Or they might not have a conference call
with 12 people to talk about a status

00:06:21.692 --> 00:06:24.975
when they could just do a quick
email and get it done with.

00:06:24.975 --> 00:06:29.809
People just might start to change their 
behavior because you changed yours.

00:06:29.809 --> 00:06:33.294
And they just might bring
your chair back, too. (Laughter)

00:06:33.294 --> 00:06:34.669
No MAS!

00:06:34.669 --> 00:06:36.109
Thank you.

00:06:36.109 --> 00:06:38.175
(Applause).
