WEBVTT

00:00:13.317 --> 00:00:14.624
Thank you.

00:00:14.624 --> 00:00:16.133
I have only got 18 minutes

00:00:16.133 --> 00:00:18.982
to explain something 
that lasts for hours and days,

00:00:18.982 --> 00:00:21.252
so I'd better get started.

00:00:21.252 --> 00:00:26.109
Let's start with a clip
from Al Jazeera's Listening Post.

00:00:26.799 --> 00:00:30.646
Richard Gizbert: Norway is a country that 
gets relatively little media coverage.

00:00:30.646 --> 00:00:33.637
Even the elections this past week
passed without much drama.

00:00:33.637 --> 00:00:36.295
And that's the Norwegian
media in a nutshell:

00:00:36.295 --> 00:00:37.772
not much drama.

00:00:37.772 --> 00:00:39.109
A few years back,

00:00:39.109 --> 00:00:41.566
Norway's public TV channel NRK

00:00:41.566 --> 00:00:45.743
decided to broadcast live coverage
of a seven-hour train ride --

00:00:45.743 --> 00:00:48.044
seven hours of simple footage,

00:00:48.044 --> 00:00:50.273
a train rolling down the tracks.

00:00:50.273 --> 00:00:54.135
Norwegians, more than a million of them
according to the ratings, loved it.

00:00:54.135 --> 00:00:57.051
A new kind of reality TV show was born,

00:00:57.051 --> 00:01:00.186
and it goes against all the rules
of TV engagement.

00:01:00.186 --> 00:01:02.626
There is no story line, no script,

00:01:02.626 --> 00:01:04.669
no drama, no climax,

00:01:04.669 --> 00:01:06.593
and it's called Slow TV.

00:01:06.593 --> 00:01:08.065
For the past two months,

00:01:08.065 --> 00:01:11.657
Norwegians have been watching 
a cruise ship's journey up the coast,

00:01:11.657 --> 00:01:13.716
and there's a lot of fog on that coast.

00:01:13.716 --> 00:01:16.789
Executives at Norway's
National Broadcasting Service

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:20.879
are now considering broadcasting
a night of knitting nationwide.

00:01:20.879 --> 00:01:23.360
On the surface, it sounds boring,

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:24.660
because it is,

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:26.750
but something about this TV experiment

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:28.608
has gripped Norwegians.

00:01:28.608 --> 00:01:31.765
So we sent the Listening Post's
Marcela Pizarro to Oslo

00:01:31.765 --> 00:01:34.296
to find out what it is,
but first a warning:

00:01:34.296 --> 00:01:38.799
Viewers may find some of the images
in the following report disappointing.

00:01:38.799 --> 00:01:39.814
(Laughter)

00:01:40.184 --> 00:01:43.700
Thomas Hellum: And then follows
an eight-minute story on Al Jazeera

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:47.026
about some strange
TV programs in little Norway.

00:01:47.026 --> 00:01:50.084
Al Jazeera. CNN. How did we get there?

00:01:50.084 --> 00:01:52.104
We have to go back to 2009,

00:01:52.104 --> 00:01:54.103
when one of my colleagues
got a great idea.

00:01:54.103 --> 00:01:55.906
Where do you get your ideas?

00:01:55.906 --> 00:01:57.387
In the lunchroom.

00:01:57.887 --> 00:02:00.864
So he said, why don't we make
a radio program

00:02:00.864 --> 00:02:04.449
marking the day of the German invasion
of Norway in 1940.

00:02:04.449 --> 00:02:08.493
We tell the story at the exact time
during the night.

00:02:08.493 --> 00:02:10.657
Wow. Brilliant idea, except

00:02:10.657 --> 00:02:13.560
this was just a couple of weeks
before the invasion day.

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.905
So we sat in our lunchroom and discussed

00:02:15.905 --> 00:02:20.113
what other stories
can you tell as they evolve?

00:02:20.113 --> 00:02:24.251
What other things take a really long time?

00:02:24.571 --> 00:02:26.887
So one of us came up with a train.

00:02:26.887 --> 00:02:30.879
The Bergen Railway had its 
100-year anniversary that year

00:02:30.879 --> 00:02:33.574
It goes from western Norway
to eastern Norway,

00:02:33.574 --> 00:02:37.737
and it takes exactly the same time
as it did 40 years ago,

00:02:37.737 --> 00:02:40.935
over seven hours. (Laughter)

00:02:40.935 --> 00:02:43.921
So we caught our commissioning editors 
in Oslo, and we said,

00:02:43.921 --> 00:02:46.908
we want to make a documentary
about the Bergen Railway,

00:02:46.908 --> 00:02:48.860
and we want to make it in full length,

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:50.214
and the answer was,

00:02:50.214 --> 00:02:52.149
"Yes, but how long will the program be?"

00:02:52.149 --> 00:02:54.007
"Oh," we said, "full length."

00:02:54.007 --> 00:02:55.499
"Yes, but we mean the program."

00:02:55.499 --> 00:02:57.606
And back and forth.

00:02:57.606 --> 00:03:03.093
Luckily for us, they met us with laughter,
very, very good laughter,

00:03:03.093 --> 00:03:05.779
so one bright day in September,

00:03:05.779 --> 00:03:09.765
we started a program that we thought
should be seven hours and four minutes.

00:03:09.765 --> 00:03:12.629
Actually, it turned out
to be seven hours and 14 minutes

00:03:12.629 --> 00:03:17.133
due to a signal failure
at the last station.

00:03:17.133 --> 00:03:19.107
We had four cameras,

00:03:19.107 --> 00:03:22.413
three of them pointing out
to the beautiful nature.

00:03:22.413 --> 00:03:26.383
Some talking to the guests,
some information.

00:03:26.383 --> 00:03:30.433
(Video) Train announcement: 
We will arrive at Haugastøl Station.

00:03:30.433 --> 00:03:31.801
TH: And that's about it,

00:03:31.801 --> 00:03:33.596
but of course, also

00:03:33.596 --> 00:03:37.437
the 160 tunnels gave us the opportunity
to do some archives.

00:03:37.437 --> 00:03:41.333
Narrator [in Norwegian]: Then a bit of
flirting while the food is digested.

00:03:42.633 --> 00:03:46.981
The last downhill stretch
before we reach our destination.

00:03:48.051 --> 00:03:51.407
We pass Mjølfjell Station.

00:03:52.357 --> 00:03:54.765
Then a new tunnel.

00:03:54.765 --> 00:03:55.915
(Laughter)

00:03:55.915 --> 00:03:59.172
TH: And now we thought, yes,
we have a brilliant program.

00:03:59.172 --> 00:04:03.769
It will fit for the 2,000
train spotters in Norway.

00:04:03.769 --> 00:04:06.370
We brought it on air in November 2009.

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:08.817
But no, this was far more attractive.

00:04:08.817 --> 00:04:12.639
This is the five biggest TV channels
in Norway on a normal Friday,

00:04:12.639 --> 00:04:14.938
and if you look at NRK2 over here,

00:04:14.938 --> 00:04:18.334
look what happened when they put on
the Bergen Railway show:

00:04:19.134 --> 00:04:22.859
1.2 million Norwegians
watched part of this program.

00:04:22.859 --> 00:04:25.184
(Applause)

00:04:26.774 --> 00:04:28.960
And another funny thing:

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:30.907
When the host on our main channel,

00:04:30.907 --> 00:04:33.374
after they have got news for you,

00:04:33.374 --> 00:04:35.812
she said, "And on our second channel,

00:04:35.812 --> 00:04:38.807
the train has now
nearly reached Myrdal station."

00:04:38.807 --> 00:04:41.500
Thousands of people
just jumped on the train

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:45.516
on our second channel like this.
(Laughter)

00:04:45.516 --> 00:04:49.162
This was also a huge success
in terms of social media.

00:04:49.162 --> 00:04:53.266
It was so nice to see all the thousands
of Facebook and Twitter users

00:04:53.266 --> 00:04:56.127
discussing the same view,

00:04:56.127 --> 00:05:00.613
talking to each other as if they were
on the same train together.

00:05:00.613 --> 00:05:03.898
And especially, I like this one.
It's a 76-year-old man.

00:05:03.898 --> 00:05:05.578
He's watched all the program,

00:05:05.578 --> 00:05:09.595
and at the end station, he rises up
to pick up what he thinks is his luggage,

00:05:09.595 --> 00:05:13.153
and his head hit the curtain rod,

00:05:13.153 --> 00:05:15.841
and he realized he is
in his own living room.

00:05:15.841 --> 00:05:20.369
(Applause)

00:05:21.576 --> 00:05:26.220
So that's strong and living TV.

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:29.564
Four hundred and thirty-six
minute by minute on a Friday night,

00:05:29.564 --> 00:05:31.425
and during that first night,

00:05:31.425 --> 00:05:33.979
the first Twitter message came:
Why be a chicken?

00:05:33.979 --> 00:05:39.648
Why stop at 436
when you can expand that

00:05:39.648 --> 00:05:43.309
to 8,040, minute by minute,

00:05:43.309 --> 00:05:45.515
and do the iconic journey in Norway,

00:05:45.515 --> 00:05:48.957
the coastal ship journey Hurtigruten
from Bergen to Kirkenes,

00:05:48.957 --> 00:05:52.511
almost 3,000 kilometers,
covering most of our coast.

00:05:52.511 --> 00:05:57.089
It has 120-year-old,
very interesting history,

00:05:57.089 --> 00:06:01.905
and literally takes part in life
and death along the coast.

00:06:01.905 --> 00:06:04.276
So just a week after the Bergen Railway,

00:06:04.276 --> 00:06:09.022
we called the Hurtigruten company
and we started planning for our next show.

00:06:10.232 --> 00:06:12.395
We wanted to do something different.

00:06:12.395 --> 00:06:15.676
The Bergen Railway was a recorded program.

00:06:15.676 --> 00:06:17.766
So when we sat in our editing room,

00:06:17.766 --> 00:06:20.370
we watched this picture --
it's all Ål Station --

00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:21.878
we saw this journalist.

00:06:21.878 --> 00:06:23.831
We had called him, we had spoken to him,

00:06:23.831 --> 00:06:25.687
and when we left the station,

00:06:25.687 --> 00:06:28.878
he took this picture of us
and he waved to the camera,

00:06:28.878 --> 00:06:30.338
and we thought,

00:06:30.338 --> 00:06:33.590
what if more people knew
that we were on board that train?

00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:35.436
Would more people show up?

00:06:35.436 --> 00:06:37.409
What would it look like?

00:06:37.409 --> 00:06:40.939
So we decided our next project,
it should be live.

00:06:40.939 --> 00:06:45.844
We wanted this picture of us on the fjord
and on the screen at the same time.

00:06:47.184 --> 00:06:50.505
So this is not the first time
NRK had been on board a ship.

00:06:50.505 --> 00:06:52.223
This is back in 1964,

00:06:52.223 --> 00:06:55.079
when the technical managers
have suits and ties

00:06:55.079 --> 00:06:59.119
and NRK rolled all its equipment
on board a ship,

00:06:59.119 --> 00:07:03.159
and 200 meters out of the shore,
transmitting the signal back,

00:07:03.159 --> 00:07:07.107
and in the machine room,
they talked to the machine guy,

00:07:07.107 --> 00:07:11.260
and on the deck, they have
splendid entertainment.

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:16.439
So being on a ship, 
it's not the first time.

00:07:17.459 --> 00:07:22.485
But five and a half days in a row,
and live, we wanted some help.

00:07:22.485 --> 00:07:26.648
And we asked our viewers out there,
what do you want to see?

00:07:26.648 --> 00:07:30.760
What do you want us to film?
How do you want this to look?

00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:33.468
Do you want us to make a website?
What do you want on it?

00:07:33.468 --> 00:07:35.706
And we got some answers
from you out there,

00:07:35.706 --> 00:07:39.957
and it helped us a very lot
to build the program.

00:07:39.957 --> 00:07:42.812
So in June 2011,

00:07:42.812 --> 00:07:46.596
23 of us went on board
the Hurtigruten coastal ship

00:07:46.596 --> 00:07:48.314
and we set off.

00:07:48.314 --> 00:07:52.146
(Music)

00:08:47.523 --> 00:08:51.242
I have some really strong memories
from that week, and it's all about people.

00:08:51.242 --> 00:08:52.882
This guy, for instance,

00:08:52.882 --> 00:08:55.575
he's head of research
at the University in Tromsø

00:08:55.575 --> 00:08:57.338
(Laughter)

00:08:57.338 --> 00:09:02.221
And I will show you a piece of cloth,

00:09:02.221 --> 00:09:05.448
this one.

00:09:06.528 --> 00:09:08.072
It's the other strong memory.

00:09:08.072 --> 00:09:11.926
It belongs to a guy called Erik Hansen.

00:09:12.946 --> 00:09:20.968
And it's people like those two
who took a firm grip of our program,

00:09:20.968 --> 00:09:24.789
and together with thousands
of others along the route,

00:09:24.789 --> 00:09:27.669
they made the program what it became.

00:09:27.669 --> 00:09:30.197
They made all the stories.

00:09:30.197 --> 00:09:33.241
This is Karl. He's in the ninth grade.

00:09:33.241 --> 00:09:36.863
It says, "I will be a little
late for school tomorrow."

00:09:36.863 --> 00:09:39.533
He was supposed to be
in the school at 8 a.m.

00:09:39.533 --> 00:09:42.634
He came at 9 a.m., and he didn't
get a note from his teacher,

00:09:42.634 --> 00:09:44.735
because the teacher
had watched the program.

00:09:44.735 --> 00:09:46.196
(Laughter)

00:09:46.196 --> 00:09:47.869
How did we do this?

00:09:47.869 --> 00:09:51.085
Yes, we took a conference room
on board the Hurtigruten.

00:09:51.085 --> 00:09:54.197
We turned it into
a complete TV control room.

00:09:54.197 --> 00:09:57.250
We made it all work, of course,

00:09:57.250 --> 00:09:59.409
and then we took along 11 cameras.

00:09:59.409 --> 00:10:00.524
This is one of them.

00:10:00.524 --> 00:10:02.497
This is my sketch from February,

00:10:02.497 --> 00:10:05.005
and when you give this sketch
to professional people

00:10:05.005 --> 00:10:07.234
in the Norwegian broadcasting company NRK,

00:10:07.234 --> 00:10:10.174
you get some cool stuff back.

00:10:10.174 --> 00:10:13.781
And with some very creative solutions.

00:10:14.351 --> 00:10:16.869
(Video) Narrator [in Norwegian]: 
Run it up and down.

00:10:16.869 --> 00:10:20.291
This is Norway's most
important drill right now.

00:10:20.291 --> 00:10:26.204
It regulates the height of a bow
camera in NRK's live production,

00:10:26.204 --> 00:10:30.940
one of 11 that capture
great shots from the MS Nord-Norge.

00:10:30.940 --> 00:10:33.611
Eight wires keep the camera stable.

00:10:33.611 --> 00:10:37.256
Cameraman: I work 
on different camera solutions.

00:10:37.256 --> 00:10:41.110
They're just tools
used in a different context.

00:10:41.110 --> 00:10:44.454
TH: Another camera is this one.
It's normally used for sports.

00:10:44.454 --> 00:10:48.053
It made it possible for us to take
close-up pictures of people

00:10:48.053 --> 00:10:50.073
100 kilomteres away,

00:10:50.073 --> 00:10:54.508
like this one. (Laughter)

00:10:54.508 --> 00:10:57.340
People called us and asked,
how is this man doing?

00:10:57.340 --> 00:11:00.289
He's doing fine. Everything went well.

00:11:00.289 --> 00:11:03.522
We also could take pictures of
people waving at us,

00:11:03.522 --> 00:11:05.839
people along the route,
thousands of them,

00:11:05.839 --> 00:11:08.264
and they all had a phone in their hand.

00:11:08.264 --> 00:11:11.249
And when you take a picture of them,
and they get the message,

00:11:11.249 --> 00:11:14.104
"Now we are on TV, dad,"
they start waving back.

00:11:14.104 --> 00:11:16.264
This was waving TV 
for five and a half days,

00:11:16.264 --> 00:11:18.423
and people get so extremely happy

00:11:18.423 --> 00:11:23.240
when they can send a warm message
to their loved ones.

00:11:23.240 --> 00:11:26.759
It was also a great success
on social media.

00:11:26.759 --> 00:11:29.568
On the last day, we met
Her Majesty the Queen of Norway,

00:11:29.568 --> 00:11:33.167
and Twitter couldn't quite handle it.

00:11:33.167 --> 00:11:35.536
And we also, on the web,

00:11:35.536 --> 00:11:40.410
during this week we streamed
more than 100 years of video

00:11:40.410 --> 00:11:43.778
to 148 nations,

00:11:43.778 --> 00:11:47.979
and the websites are still there
and they will be forever, actually,

00:11:47.979 --> 00:11:49.885
because Hurtigruten was selected

00:11:49.885 --> 00:11:54.417
to be part of the Norwegian
UNESCO list of documents,

00:11:54.417 --> 00:11:57.408
and it's also in
the Guinness Book of Records

00:11:57.408 --> 00:12:00.914
as the longest documentary ever.

00:12:00.914 --> 00:12:04.397
(Applause)

00:12:04.397 --> 00:12:08.135
Thank you.

00:12:08.135 --> 00:12:11.525
But it's a long program,

00:12:11.525 --> 00:12:14.613
so some watched part of it,
like the Prime Minister.

00:12:14.613 --> 00:12:16.355
Some watched a little bit more.

00:12:16.355 --> 00:12:20.764
It says, "I haven't used
my bed for five days."

00:12:20.764 --> 00:12:25.235
And he's 82 years old,
and he hardly slept.

00:12:25.235 --> 00:12:28.591
He kept watching because
something might happen,

00:12:28.591 --> 00:12:31.004
though it probably won't. (Laughter)

00:12:31.004 --> 00:12:33.653
This is the number
of viewers along the route.

00:12:33.653 --> 00:12:35.255
You can see the famous Trollfjord

00:12:35.255 --> 00:12:39.999
and a day after, all-time high for NRK2.

00:12:39.999 --> 00:12:45.821
If you see the four biggest
channels in Norway during June 2011,

00:12:45.821 --> 00:12:48.118
they will look like this,

00:12:48.118 --> 00:12:51.968
and as a TV producer, it's a pleasure
to put Hurtigruten on top of it.

00:12:51.968 --> 00:12:53.691
It looks like this:

00:12:53.691 --> 00:12:57.058
3.2 million Norwegians
watched part of this program,

00:12:57.058 --> 00:12:58.938
and we are only five million here.

00:12:58.938 --> 00:13:01.972
Even the passengers on board
the Hurtigruten coastal ship --

00:13:01.972 --> 00:13:03.586
(Laughter) --

00:13:03.586 --> 00:13:07.711
they chose to watched the telly
instead of turning 90 degrees

00:13:07.711 --> 00:13:09.825
and watching out the window.

00:13:10.585 --> 00:13:13.566
So we were allowed to be 
part of people's living room

00:13:13.566 --> 00:13:16.323
with this strange TV program,

00:13:16.323 --> 00:13:19.696
with music, nature, people.

00:13:19.696 --> 00:13:22.389
And Slow TV was now a buzzword,

00:13:22.389 --> 00:13:26.223
and we started looking for other things
we could make Slow TV about.

00:13:26.223 --> 00:13:29.665
So we could either take something long
and make it a topic,

00:13:29.665 --> 00:13:31.886
like with the railway and the Hurtigruten,

00:13:31.886 --> 00:13:34.417
or we could take a topic and make it long.

00:13:34.417 --> 00:13:36.925
This is the last project.
It's the peep show.

00:13:36.925 --> 00:13:39.711
It's 14 hours of birdwatching
on a TV screen,

00:13:39.711 --> 00:13:42.892
actually 87 days on the web.

00:13:42.892 --> 00:13:46.514
We have made 18 hours
of live salmon fishing.

00:13:46.514 --> 00:13:49.579
It actually took three hours
before we got the first fish,

00:13:49.579 --> 00:13:51.390
and that's quite slow.

00:13:51.390 --> 00:13:56.426
We have made 12 hours of boat ride
into the beautiful Telemark Canal,

00:13:56.426 --> 00:13:59.971
and we have made another train ride
with the northern railway,

00:13:59.971 --> 00:14:03.973
and because this we couldn't do live,
we did it in four seasons

00:14:03.973 --> 00:14:08.048
just to give the viewer
another experience on the way.

00:14:09.208 --> 00:14:13.748
So our next project got us
some attention outside Norway.

00:14:13.748 --> 00:14:16.634
This is from the Colbert Report
on Comedy Central.

00:14:16.634 --> 00:14:20.430
(Video) Stephen Colbert: I've got my eye
on a wildly popular program from Norway

00:14:20.430 --> 00:14:23.363
called "National Firewood Night,"

00:14:23.363 --> 00:14:27.635
which consisted of mostly people in parkas
chatting and chopping in the woods,

00:14:27.635 --> 00:14:31.280
and then eight hours of a fire 
burning in a fireplace. (Laughter)

00:14:31.280 --> 00:14:33.881
It destroyed the other 
top Norwegian shows,

00:14:33.881 --> 00:14:36.296
like "So You Think
You Can Watch Paint Dry"

00:14:36.296 --> 00:14:40.127
and "The Amazing Glacier Race."

00:14:40.127 --> 00:14:45.332
And get this, almost 20 percent
of the Norwegian population tuned in,

00:14:45.332 --> 00:14:47.000
20 percent.

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:50.877
TH: So, when wood fire and wood chopping
can be that interesting,

00:14:50.877 --> 00:14:52.410
why not knitting?

00:14:52.410 --> 00:14:54.128
So on our next project,

00:14:54.128 --> 00:14:59.145
we used more than eight hours
to go live from a sheep to a sweater,

00:14:59.145 --> 00:15:01.452
and Jimmy Kimmel in the ABC show,

00:15:01.452 --> 00:15:03.601
he liked that.

00:15:03.601 --> 00:15:10.474
(Music)

00:15:10.474 --> 00:15:14.194
(Video) Jimmy Kimmel: Even the people
on the show are falling asleep,

00:15:14.194 --> 00:15:16.470
and after all that,
the knitters actually failed

00:15:16.470 --> 00:15:18.146
to break the world record.

00:15:18.146 --> 00:15:19.492
They did not succeed,

00:15:19.492 --> 00:15:21.735
but remember the old Norwegian saying,

00:15:21.735 --> 00:15:23.913
it's not whether you win
or lose that counts.

00:15:23.913 --> 00:15:26.637
In fact, nothing counts, 
and death is coming for us all.

00:15:26.637 --> 00:15:28.081
(Laughter)

00:15:28.081 --> 00:15:30.975
TH: Exactly. So why does this stand out?

00:15:30.975 --> 00:15:34.255
This is so completely different
to other TV programming.

00:15:34.255 --> 00:15:38.997
We take the viewer on a journey
that happens right now in real time,

00:15:38.997 --> 00:15:42.574
and the viewer gets the feeling
of actually being there,

00:15:42.574 --> 00:15:44.738
actually being on the train, on the boat,

00:15:44.738 --> 00:15:46.565
and knitting together with others,

00:15:46.565 --> 00:15:49.022
and the reason I think
why they're doing that

00:15:49.022 --> 00:15:51.502
is because we don't edit the timeline.

00:15:51.502 --> 00:15:53.870
It's important that
we don't edit the timeline,

00:15:53.870 --> 00:15:57.069
and it's also important
that what we make Slow TV about

00:15:57.069 --> 00:16:01.798
is something that we all can relate to,
that the viewer can relate to,

00:16:01.798 --> 00:16:04.915
and that somehow has 
a root in our culture.

00:16:04.915 --> 00:16:06.641
This is a picture from last summer

00:16:06.641 --> 00:16:09.218
when we traveled the coast
again for seven weeks.

00:16:09.218 --> 00:16:13.581
And of course this is a lot of planning,
this is a lot of logistics.

00:16:13.581 --> 00:16:17.693
So this is the working plan
for 150 people last summer,

00:16:17.693 --> 00:16:20.538
but more important is what you don't plan.

00:16:20.538 --> 00:16:23.055
You don't plan what's going to happen.

00:16:23.055 --> 00:16:26.041
You have to just
take your cameras with you.

00:16:26.041 --> 00:16:27.561
It's like a sports event.

00:16:27.561 --> 00:16:29.720
You rig them and you see what's happening.

00:16:29.720 --> 00:16:32.204
So this is actually
the whole running order

00:16:32.204 --> 00:16:36.651
for Hurtigruten, 134 hours,
just written on one page.

00:16:36.651 --> 00:16:40.703
We didn't know anything more
when we left Bergen.

00:16:40.703 --> 00:16:44.047
So you have to let the viewers
make the stories themselves,

00:16:44.047 --> 00:16:46.276
and I'll give you an example of that.

00:16:46.276 --> 00:16:48.040
This is from last summer,

00:16:48.040 --> 00:16:49.898
and as a TV producer,

00:16:49.898 --> 00:16:53.545
it's a nice picture, but now
you can cut to the next one.

00:16:53.545 --> 00:16:55.285
But this is Slow TV,

00:16:55.285 --> 00:16:58.959
so you have to keep this picture until 
it really starts hurting your stomach,

00:16:58.959 --> 00:17:01.319
and then you keep it a little bit longer,

00:17:01.319 --> 00:17:02.839
and when you keep it that long,

00:17:02.839 --> 00:17:05.603
I'm sure some of you now
have noticed the cow.

00:17:05.603 --> 00:17:07.637
Some of you have seen the flag.

00:17:07.637 --> 00:17:10.043
Some of you start wondering,
is the farmer at home?

00:17:10.043 --> 00:17:12.490
Has he left? Is he watching the cow?

00:17:12.490 --> 00:17:15.717
And where is that cow going?

00:17:15.717 --> 00:17:18.951
So my point is, the longer
you keep a picture like this,

00:17:18.951 --> 00:17:21.243
and we kept it for 10 minutes,

00:17:21.243 --> 00:17:25.214
you start making
the stories in your own head.

00:17:25.214 --> 00:17:29.417
That's Slow TV.

00:17:29.417 --> 00:17:34.827
So we think that Slow TV is
one nice way of telling a TV story,

00:17:34.827 --> 00:17:37.311
and we think that we
can continue doing it,

00:17:37.311 --> 00:17:41.815
not too often, once or twice a year,
so we keep the feeling of an event,

00:17:41.815 --> 00:17:44.718
and we also think that
the good Slow TV idea,

00:17:44.718 --> 00:17:46.390
that's the idea when people say,

00:17:46.390 --> 00:17:49.826
"Oh no, you can't put that on TV."

00:17:49.826 --> 00:17:52.868
When people smile, it might be
a very good slow idea,

00:17:52.868 --> 00:17:57.120
so after all, life is best
when it's a bit strange.

00:17:57.120 --> 00:17:58.613
Thank you.

00:17:58.613 --> 00:18:05.197
(Applause)
