00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.118
I'm a tourism entrepreneur
and a peacebuilder,

00:00:16.118 --> 00:00:18.974
but this is not how I started.

00:00:18.974 --> 00:00:22.039
When I was seven years old,
I remember watching television

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:24.616
and seeing people throwing rocks,

00:00:24.616 --> 00:00:28.006
and thinking, this must be
a fun thing to do.

00:00:28.006 --> 00:00:30.351
So I got out to the street
and threw rocks,

00:00:30.351 --> 00:00:34.832
not realizing I was supposed
to throw rocks at Israeli cars.

00:00:34.832 --> 00:00:39.058
Instead, I ended up stoning
my neighbors' cars. (Laughter)

00:00:39.058 --> 00:00:42.960
They were not enthusiastic
about my patriotism.

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.054
This is my picture with my brother.

00:00:45.054 --> 00:00:47.889
This is me, the little one,
and I know what you're thinking:

00:00:47.889 --> 00:00:50.830
"You used to look cute,
what the heck happened to you?"

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:52.781
But my brother, who is older than me,

00:00:52.781 --> 00:00:55.195
was arrested when he was 18,

00:00:55.195 --> 00:00:58.144
taken to prison on charges
of throwing stones.

00:00:58.144 --> 00:01:01.720
He was beaten up when he refused
to confess that he threw stones,

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:04.321
and as a result, had internal injuries

00:01:04.321 --> 00:01:08.964
that caused his death soon after
he was released from prison.

00:01:08.964 --> 00:01:12.610
I was angry, I was bitter,

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:16.302
and all I wanted was revenge.

00:01:16.302 --> 00:01:18.809
But that changed when I was 18.

00:01:18.809 --> 00:01:22.246
I decided that I needed
Hebrew to get a job,

00:01:22.246 --> 00:01:24.753
and going to study Hebrew
in that classroom

00:01:24.753 --> 00:01:30.187
was the first time I ever met Jews
who were not soldiers.

00:01:30.187 --> 00:01:35.069
And we connected over really small things,
like the fact that I love country music,

00:01:35.069 --> 00:01:38.796
which is really strange
for Palestinians.

00:01:38.796 --> 00:01:43.456
But it was then that I realized also
that we have a wall of anger,

00:01:43.456 --> 00:01:49.069
of hatred and of ignorance
that separates us.

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:53.568
I decided that it doesn't matter
what happens to me.

00:01:53.568 --> 00:01:56.261
What really matters is how I deal with it.

00:01:56.261 --> 00:01:59.605
And therefore, I decided
to dedicate my life

00:01:59.605 --> 00:02:03.993
to bringing down the walls
that separate people.

00:02:03.993 --> 00:02:06.013
I do so through many ways.

00:02:06.013 --> 00:02:09.113
Tourism is one of them,
but also media and education,

00:02:09.113 --> 00:02:12.807
and you might be wondering,
really, can tourism change things?

00:02:12.807 --> 00:02:14.517
Can it bring down walls? Yes.

00:02:14.517 --> 00:02:19.237
Tourism is the best sustainable way
to bring down those walls

00:02:19.237 --> 00:02:23.622
and to create a sustainable way
of connecting with each other

00:02:23.622 --> 00:02:26.176
and creating friendships.

00:02:26.176 --> 00:02:29.961
In 2009, I cofounded Mejdi Tours,

00:02:29.961 --> 00:02:33.421
a social enterprise that
aims to connect people,

00:02:33.421 --> 00:02:35.882
with two Jewish friends, by the way,

00:02:35.882 --> 00:02:38.181
and what we'll do, the model we did,

00:02:38.181 --> 00:02:41.687
for example, in Jerusalem,
we would have two tour guides,

00:02:41.687 --> 00:02:45.146
one Israeli and one Palestinian,
guiding the trips together,

00:02:45.146 --> 00:02:48.351
telling history and narrative
and archaeology and conflict

00:02:48.351 --> 00:02:51.323
from totally different perspectives.

00:02:51.323 --> 00:02:54.681
I remember running a trip together
with a friend named Kobi --

00:02:54.681 --> 00:02:57.705
Jewish congregation from Chicago,
the trip was in Jerusalem --

00:02:57.705 --> 00:03:00.867
and we took them to a refugee camp,
a Palestinian refugee camp,

00:03:00.867 --> 00:03:02.967
and there we had this amazing food.

00:03:02.967 --> 00:03:05.850
By the way, this is my mother. She's cool.

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:08.404
And that's the Palestinian
food called maqluba.

00:03:08.404 --> 00:03:09.721
It means "upside-down."

00:03:09.721 --> 00:03:12.945
You cook it with rice and chicken,
and you flip it upside-down.

00:03:12.945 --> 00:03:14.586
It's the best meal ever.

00:03:14.586 --> 00:03:15.894
And we'll eat together.

00:03:15.894 --> 00:03:18.698
Then we had a joint band,
Israeli and Palestinian musicians,

00:03:18.698 --> 00:03:20.555
and we did some belly-dancing.

00:03:20.555 --> 00:03:23.945
If you don't know any,
I'll teach you later.

00:03:23.945 --> 00:03:27.057
But when we left, both sides,

00:03:27.057 --> 00:03:29.634
they were crying because
they did not want to leave.

00:03:29.634 --> 00:03:33.256
Three years later, those
relationships still exist.

00:03:33.256 --> 00:03:36.066
Imagine with me
if the one billion people

00:03:36.066 --> 00:03:39.873
who travel internationally 
every year travel like this,

00:03:39.874 --> 00:03:42.846
not being taken in the bus
from one side to another,

00:03:42.846 --> 00:03:45.167
from one hotel to another,

00:03:45.167 --> 00:03:49.138
taking pictures from the windows
of their buses of people and cultures,

00:03:49.138 --> 00:03:52.319
but actually connecting with people.

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:56.243
You know, I remember having
a Muslim group from the U.K.

00:03:56.243 --> 00:03:59.029
going to the house
of an Orthodox Jewish family,

00:03:59.029 --> 00:04:03.418
and having their first Friday night
dinners, that Sabbath dinner,

00:04:03.418 --> 00:04:06.993
and eating together hamin,
which is a Jewish food, a stew,

00:04:06.993 --> 00:04:09.872
just having the connection
of realizing, after a while,

00:04:09.872 --> 00:04:12.844
that a hundred years ago,
their families came out

00:04:12.844 --> 00:04:15.923
of the same place in Northern Africa.

00:04:15.923 --> 00:04:18.998
This is not a photo profile
for your Facebook.

00:04:18.998 --> 00:04:20.832
This is not disaster tourism.

00:04:20.832 --> 00:04:23.200
This is the future of travel,

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:26.264
and I invite you to join me to do that,
to change your travel.

00:04:26.264 --> 00:04:28.215
We're doing it all over the world now,

00:04:28.215 --> 00:04:30.653
from Ireland to Iran to Turkey,

00:04:30.653 --> 00:04:33.649
and we see ourselves going
everywhere to change the world.

00:04:33.649 --> 00:04:34.879
Thank you.

00:04:34.879 --> 00:04:36.783
(Applause)
