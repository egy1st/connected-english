WEBVTT

00:00:13.079 --> 00:00:14.966
I am multidisciplinary.

00:00:14.966 --> 00:00:19.949
As a scientist, I've been a crew commander
for a NASA Mars simulation last year,

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:26.868
and as an artist, I create multicultural
community art all over the planet.

00:00:26.868 --> 00:00:29.772
And recently, I've actually
been combining both.

00:00:29.772 --> 00:00:32.777
But let me first talk a little more
about that NASA mission.

00:00:33.487 --> 00:00:35.390
This is the HI-SEAS program.

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:39.086
HI-SEAS is a NASA-funded
planetary surface analogue

00:00:39.086 --> 00:00:41.814
on the Mauna Loa volcano in Hawaii,

00:00:41.814 --> 00:00:44.840
and it's a research program
that is specifically designed

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:49.863
to study the effects
of long-term isolation of small crews.

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:53.751
I lived in this dome for four months
with a crew of six,

00:00:53.751 --> 00:00:56.536
a very interesting experience, of course.

00:00:56.536 --> 00:00:58.519
We did all kinds of research.

00:00:59.619 --> 00:01:01.971
Our main research
was actually a food study,

00:01:01.971 --> 00:01:03.850
but apart from that food study --

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:07.638
developing a new food system
for astronauts living in deep space --

00:01:07.638 --> 00:01:09.771
we also did all kinds of other research.

00:01:09.771 --> 00:01:13.092
We did extra-vehicular activities,
as you can see here,

00:01:13.092 --> 00:01:15.136
wearing mock-up space suits,

00:01:15.136 --> 00:01:17.805
but we also had our chores
and lots of other stuff to do,

00:01:17.805 --> 00:01:20.057
like questionnaires
at the end of every day.

00:01:20.057 --> 00:01:21.850
Busy, busy work.

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:23.902
Now, as you can imagine,

00:01:23.902 --> 00:01:26.954
it's quite challenging to live
with just a small group of people

00:01:26.954 --> 00:01:29.137
in a small space for a long time.

00:01:29.137 --> 00:01:31.366
There's all kinds
of psychological challenges:

00:01:31.366 --> 00:01:35.242
how to keep a team together
in these circumstances;

00:01:35.242 --> 00:01:37.972
how to deal with the warping of time
you start to sense

00:01:37.972 --> 00:01:40.165
when you're living in these circumstances;

00:01:40.165 --> 00:01:42.099
sleep problems that arise; etc.

00:01:42.099 --> 00:01:44.183
But also we learned a lot.

00:01:44.183 --> 00:01:46.899
I learned a lot about
how individual crew members

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:49.569
actually cope with a situation like this;

00:01:49.569 --> 00:01:53.076
how you can keep a crew
productive and happy,

00:01:53.076 --> 00:01:55.676
for example, giving them
a good deal of autonomy

00:01:55.676 --> 00:01:57.208
is a good trick to do that;

00:01:57.208 --> 00:02:00.197
and honestly, I learned
a lot about leadership,

00:02:00.197 --> 00:02:02.085
because I was a crew commander.

00:02:02.085 --> 00:02:03.989
So doing this mission,

00:02:03.989 --> 00:02:08.875
I really started thinking more deeply
about our future in outer space.

00:02:08.875 --> 00:02:12.544
We will venture into outer space,
and we will start inhabiting outer space.

00:02:12.544 --> 00:02:14.309
I have no doubt about it.

00:02:14.309 --> 00:02:17.894
It might take 50 years
or it might take 500 years,

00:02:17.894 --> 00:02:20.593
but it's going to happen nevertheless.

00:02:20.593 --> 00:02:24.584
So I came up with
a new art project called Seeker.

00:02:24.584 --> 00:02:28.505
And the Seeker project is actually
challenging communities all over the world

00:02:28.505 --> 00:02:31.359
to come up with starship prototypes

00:02:31.359 --> 00:02:34.663
that re-envision
human habitation and survival.

00:02:34.663 --> 00:02:36.532
That's the core of the project.

00:02:36.532 --> 00:02:38.889
Now, one important thing:

00:02:38.889 --> 00:02:41.394
This is not a dystopian project.

00:02:41.394 --> 00:02:44.106
This is not about, "Oh my God,
the world is going wrong

00:02:44.106 --> 00:02:47.368
and we have to escape because we need
another future somewhere else."

00:02:47.368 --> 00:02:48.649
No, no.

00:02:49.179 --> 00:02:51.846
The project is basically inviting people

00:02:51.846 --> 00:02:54.811
to take a step away
from earthbound constraints

00:02:54.811 --> 00:02:57.469
and, as such, reimagine our future.

00:02:57.469 --> 00:03:00.153
And it's really helpful,
and it works really well,

00:03:00.153 --> 00:03:04.410
so that's really the important part
of what we're doing.

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:09.138
Now, in this project,
I'm using a cocreation approach,

00:03:09.138 --> 00:03:11.228
which is a slightly different approach

00:03:11.228 --> 00:03:13.730
from what you would expect
from many artists.

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:18.112
I'm essentially dropping a basic idea
into a group, into a community,

00:03:18.113 --> 00:03:20.641
people start gravitating to the idea,

00:03:20.641 --> 00:03:24.001
and together, we shape 
and build the artwork.

00:03:24.001 --> 00:03:26.168
It's a little bit like termites, really.

00:03:26.168 --> 00:03:27.458
We just work together,

00:03:27.458 --> 00:03:30.414
and even, for example,
when architects visit what we're doing,

00:03:30.414 --> 00:03:32.999
sometimes they have a bit
of a hard time understanding

00:03:32.999 --> 00:03:34.677
how we build without a master plan.

00:03:34.677 --> 00:03:38.136
We always come up with these
fantastic large-scale scupltures

00:03:38.136 --> 00:03:40.678
that actually we can also inhabit.

00:03:41.828 --> 00:03:45.172
The first version was done
in Belgium and Holland.

00:03:45.172 --> 00:03:48.074
It was built with a team
of almost 50 people.

00:03:48.074 --> 00:03:50.935
This is the second iteration
of that same project,

00:03:50.935 --> 00:03:52.895
but in Slovenia, in a different country,

00:03:52.895 --> 00:03:57.137
and the new group was like, we're going 
to do the architecture differently.

00:03:57.137 --> 00:04:00.441
So they took away the architecture,
they kept the base of the artwork,

00:04:00.441 --> 00:04:02.493
and they built an entirely new,

00:04:02.493 --> 00:04:05.164
much more biomorphic
architecture on top of that.

00:04:05.164 --> 00:04:07.579
And that's another
crucial part of the project.

00:04:07.579 --> 00:04:11.460
It's an evolving artwork,
evolving architecture.

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:15.287
This was the last version that was just
presented a few weeks ago in Holland,

00:04:15.287 --> 00:04:19.432
which was using caravans 
as modules to build a starship.

00:04:19.432 --> 00:04:21.458
We bought some second-hand caravans,

00:04:21.458 --> 00:04:22.755
cut them open,

00:04:22.755 --> 00:04:25.492
and reassembled them into a starship.

00:04:25.492 --> 00:04:28.399
Now, when we're thinking about starships,

00:04:28.399 --> 00:04:31.437
we're not just approaching it
as a technological challenge.

00:04:31.437 --> 00:04:34.365
We're really looking at it
as a combination of three systems:

00:04:34.365 --> 00:04:36.746
ecology, people and technology.

00:04:36.746 --> 00:04:40.304
So there's always a strong ecological
component in the project.

00:04:40.304 --> 00:04:42.673
Here you can see aquaponic systems

00:04:42.673 --> 00:04:44.877
that are actually
surrounding the astronauts,

00:04:44.877 --> 00:04:50.369
so they're constantly in contact
with part of the food that they're eating.

00:04:50.809 --> 00:04:53.845
Now, a very typical thing for this project

00:04:53.845 --> 00:05:00.923
is that we run our own isolation missions
inside these art and design projects.

00:05:00.923 --> 00:05:03.897
We actually lock ourselves up
for multiple days on end,

00:05:03.897 --> 00:05:05.597
and test what we build.

00:05:05.597 --> 00:05:07.025
And this is, for example,

00:05:07.025 --> 00:05:09.639
on the right hand side
you can see an isolation mission

00:05:09.639 --> 00:05:12.557
in the Museum of Modern Art
in Ljubljana in Slovenia,

00:05:12.557 --> 00:05:15.175
where six artists and designers
locked themselves up --

00:05:15.175 --> 00:05:17.085
I was part of that --

00:05:17.085 --> 00:05:19.323
for four days inside the museum.

00:05:19.323 --> 00:05:22.078
And, of course, obviously,
this is a very performative

00:05:22.078 --> 00:05:26.280
and very strong experience for all of us.

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:30.699
Now, the next version of the project
is currently being developed

00:05:30.699 --> 00:05:34.662
together with Camilo Rodriguez-Beltran,
who is also a TED Fellow,

00:05:34.662 --> 00:05:38.938
in the Atacama Desert in Chile,
a magical place.

00:05:38.938 --> 00:05:42.046
First of all, it's really
considered a Mars analogue.

00:05:42.046 --> 00:05:44.740
It really does look like Mars
in certain locations

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:48.269
and has been used by NASA
to test equipment.

00:05:48.269 --> 00:05:51.372
And it has a long history
of being connected to space

00:05:51.372 --> 00:05:54.127
through observations of the stars.

00:05:54.127 --> 00:05:55.795
It's now home to ALMA,

00:05:55.795 --> 00:05:58.573
the large telescope
that's being developed there.

00:05:59.333 --> 00:06:03.293
But also, it's the driest
location on the planet,

00:06:03.293 --> 00:06:06.294
and that makes it extremely interesting
to build our project,

00:06:06.294 --> 00:06:11.979
because suddenly, sustainability
is something we have to explore fully.

00:06:11.979 --> 00:06:13.811
We have no other option,

00:06:13.811 --> 00:06:16.224
so I'm very curious to see
what's going to happen.

00:06:16.224 --> 00:06:20.381
Now, a specific thing for this
particular version of the project

00:06:20.381 --> 00:06:22.563
is that I'm very interested to see

00:06:22.563 --> 00:06:24.719
how we can connect
with the local population,

00:06:24.719 --> 00:06:25.952
the native population.

00:06:25.952 --> 00:06:28.694
These people have been living there
for a very long time

00:06:28.694 --> 00:06:31.666
and can be considered
experts in sustainability,

00:06:31.666 --> 00:06:34.637
and so I'm very interested
to see what we can learn from them,

00:06:34.637 --> 00:06:37.969
and have an input of indigenous knowledge
into space exploration.

00:06:38.869 --> 00:06:43.748
So we're trying to redefine
how we look at our future in outer space

00:06:43.748 --> 00:06:48.152
by exploring integration,
biology, technology and people;

00:06:48.152 --> 00:06:50.802
by using a cocreation approach;

00:06:50.802 --> 00:06:54.249
and by using and exploring
local traditions

00:06:54.249 --> 00:06:58.678
and to see how we can learn from the past
and integrate that into our deep future.

00:06:58.678 --> 00:07:00.471
Thank you.

00:07:00.471 --> 00:07:03.095
(Applause)
