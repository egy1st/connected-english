00:00:13.683 --> 00:00:16.629
As a software developer and technologist,

00:00:16.629 --> 00:00:19.276
I've worked on a number
of civic technology projects

00:00:19.276 --> 00:00:20.622
over the years.

00:00:20.622 --> 00:00:24.268
Civic tech is sometimes
referred to as tech for good,

00:00:24.268 --> 00:00:27.913
using technology to solve
humanitarian problems.

00:00:27.913 --> 00:00:30.026
This is in 2010 in Uganda,

00:00:30.026 --> 00:00:32.766
working on a solution
that allowed local populations

00:00:32.766 --> 00:00:36.249
to avoid government surveillance
on their mobile phones

00:00:36.249 --> 00:00:38.478
for expressing dissent.

00:00:38.478 --> 00:00:41.366
That same technology was deployed
later in North Africa

00:00:41.366 --> 00:00:45.148
for similar purposes
to help activists stay connected

00:00:45.148 --> 00:00:48.299
when governments were
deliberately shutting off connectivity

00:00:48.299 --> 00:00:50.375
as a means of population control.

00:00:51.486 --> 00:00:54.672
But over the years, as I have thought
about these technologies

00:00:54.672 --> 00:00:56.673
and the things that I work on,

00:00:56.673 --> 00:00:59.692
a question kind of nags
in the back of my mind, which is,

00:00:59.692 --> 00:01:02.417
what if we're wrong about
the virtues of technology,

00:01:02.417 --> 00:01:04.669
and if it sometimes actively hurts

00:01:04.669 --> 00:01:07.827
the communities
that we're intending to help?

00:01:07.827 --> 00:01:11.606
The tech industry around the world
tends to operate under similar assumptions

00:01:11.606 --> 00:01:13.771
that if we build great things,

00:01:13.771 --> 00:01:16.185
it will positively affect everyone.

00:01:16.185 --> 00:01:20.054
Eventually, these innovations
will get out and find everyone.

00:01:20.054 --> 00:01:22.153
But that's not always the case.

00:01:22.153 --> 00:01:27.934
I like to call this blind championing
of technology "trickle-down techonomics,"

00:01:27.934 --> 00:01:30.279
to borrow a phrase. (Laughter)

00:01:30.279 --> 00:01:33.195
We tend to think that if
we design things for the select few,

00:01:33.195 --> 00:01:35.597
eventually those technologies
will reach everyone,

00:01:35.597 --> 00:01:37.152
and that's not always the case.

00:01:37.152 --> 00:01:42.168
Technology and innovation
behaves a lot like wealth and capital.

00:01:42.168 --> 00:01:45.047
They tend to consolidate
in the hands of the few,

00:01:45.047 --> 00:01:48.437
and sometimes they find their way out
into the hands of the many.

00:01:48.437 --> 00:01:53.638
And so most of you aren't tackling
oppressive regimes on the weekends,

00:01:53.638 --> 00:01:57.864
so I wanted to think of a few examples
that might be a little bit more relatable.

00:01:57.864 --> 00:02:02.216
In the world of wearables
and smartphones and apps,

00:02:02.216 --> 00:02:05.479
there's a big movement
to track people's personal health

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:08.527
with applications that track
the number of calories that you burn

00:02:08.551 --> 00:02:13.370
or whether you're sitting too much
or walking enough.

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:19.711
These technologies make patient intake
in medical facilities much more efficient,

00:02:19.711 --> 00:02:23.646
and in turn, these medical facilities

00:02:23.646 --> 00:02:26.233
are starting to expect
these types of efficiencies.

00:02:26.233 --> 00:02:29.033
As these digital tools
find their way into medical rooms,

00:02:29.033 --> 00:02:31.078
and they become digitally ready,

00:02:31.078 --> 00:02:33.447
what happens to the digitally invisible?

00:02:33.447 --> 00:02:35.447
What does the medical experience look like

00:02:35.471 --> 00:02:38.805
for someone who doesn't have
the $400 phone or watch

00:02:38.805 --> 00:02:40.598
tracking their every movement?

00:02:40.598 --> 00:02:43.431
Do they now become a burden
on the medical system?

00:02:43.431 --> 00:02:46.229
Is their experience changed?

00:02:46.229 --> 00:02:49.491
In the world of finance,
Bitcoin and crypto-currencies

00:02:49.491 --> 00:02:52.411
are revolutionizing the way
we move money around the world,

00:02:52.411 --> 00:02:54.808
but the challenge with these technologies

00:02:54.808 --> 00:02:57.397
is the barrier to entry
is incredibly high, right?

00:02:57.397 --> 00:03:01.193
You need access to the same
phones, devices, connectivity,

00:03:01.193 --> 00:03:04.328
and even where you don't,
where you can find a proxy agent,

00:03:04.328 --> 00:03:09.367
usually they require a certain amount
of capital to participate.

00:03:09.367 --> 00:03:14.150
And so the question that I ask myself
is, what happens to the last community

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:18.220
using paper notes when the rest
of the world moves to digital currency?

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:23.205
Another example from my hometown
in Philadelphia:

00:03:23.205 --> 00:03:25.370
I recently went
to the public library there,

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:27.942
and they are facing an existential crisis.

00:03:27.942 --> 00:03:29.615
Public funding is dwindling,

00:03:29.615 --> 00:03:34.791
they have to reduce their footprint
to stay open and stay relevant,

00:03:34.791 --> 00:03:37.627
and so one of the ways
they're going about this

00:03:37.627 --> 00:03:40.920
is digitizing a number of the books
and moving them to the cloud.

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:42.895
This is great for most kids. Right?

00:03:42.895 --> 00:03:44.748
You can check out books from home,

00:03:44.748 --> 00:03:47.297
you can research on the way
to school or from school,

00:03:47.297 --> 00:03:49.489
but these are really two big assumptions,

00:03:49.489 --> 00:03:51.486
that one, you have access at home,

00:03:51.486 --> 00:03:54.086
and two, that you have access
to a mobile phone,

00:03:54.086 --> 00:03:56.962
and in Philadelphia, many kids do not.

00:03:56.962 --> 00:03:59.821
So what does their
education experience look like

00:03:59.821 --> 00:04:03.258
in the wake of a completely
cloud-based library,

00:04:03.258 --> 00:04:06.717
what used to be considered
such a basic part of education?

00:04:06.717 --> 00:04:08.706
How do they stay competitive?

00:04:09.716 --> 00:04:13.616
A final example from
across the world in East Africa:

00:04:13.616 --> 00:04:18.932
there's been a huge movement
to digitize land ownership rights,

00:04:18.932 --> 00:04:20.533
for a number of reasons.

00:04:20.533 --> 00:04:23.435
Migrant communities,
older generations dying off,

00:04:23.435 --> 00:04:26.075
and ultimately poor record-keeping

00:04:26.075 --> 00:04:29.542
have led to conflicts over who owns what.

00:04:29.542 --> 00:04:33.814
And so there was a big movement
to put all this information online,

00:04:33.814 --> 00:04:37.574
to track all the ownership
of these plots of land,

00:04:37.574 --> 00:04:40.269
put them in the cloud,
and give them to the communities.

00:04:40.269 --> 00:04:43.311
But actually, the unintended
consequence of this

00:04:43.311 --> 00:04:47.681
has been that venture capitalists,
investors, real estate developers,

00:04:47.734 --> 00:04:50.708
have swooped in and they've begun
buying up these plots of land

00:04:50.797 --> 00:04:52.714
right out from under these communities,

00:04:52.714 --> 00:04:54.850
because they have access
to the technologies

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:58.287
and the connectivity
that makes that possible.

00:04:58.287 --> 00:05:01.437
So that's the common thread
that connects these examples,

00:05:01.437 --> 00:05:04.986
the unintended consequences of the tools
and the technologies that we make.

00:05:04.986 --> 00:05:07.951
As engineers, as technologists,

00:05:07.951 --> 00:05:11.510
we sometimes prefer
efficiency over efficacy.

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:15.903
We think more about doing things
than the outcomes of what we are doing.

00:05:15.903 --> 00:05:17.370
This needs to change.

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:21.401
We have a responsibility to think about
the outcomes of the technologies we build,

00:05:21.401 --> 00:05:24.884
especially as they increasingly
control the world in which we live.

00:05:24.884 --> 00:05:26.324
In the late '90s,

00:05:26.324 --> 00:05:30.433
there was a big push for ethics
in the world of investment and banking.

00:05:30.433 --> 00:05:34.241
I think in 2014, we're long overdue
for a similar movement

00:05:34.241 --> 00:05:37.903
in the area of tech and technology.

00:05:38.723 --> 00:05:42.685
So, I just encourage you, as you are all
thinking about the next big thing,

00:05:42.685 --> 00:05:48.057
as entrepreneurs, as CEOs,
as engineers, as makers,

00:05:48.057 --> 00:05:51.934
that you think about
the unintended consequences

00:05:51.934 --> 00:05:54.094
of the things that you're building,

00:05:54.094 --> 00:05:57.646
because the real innovation
is in finding ways to include everyone.

00:05:57.646 --> 00:05:59.318
Thank you.

00:05:59.318 --> 00:06:03.428
(Applause)
