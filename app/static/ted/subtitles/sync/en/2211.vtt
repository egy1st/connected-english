WEBVTT

00:00:13.189 --> 00:00:15.842
I cannot forget them.

00:00:15.842 --> 00:00:20.619
Their names were Aslan, Alik, Andrei,

00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:25.263
Fernanda, Fred, Galina, Gunnhild,

00:00:25.263 --> 00:00:30.557
Hans, Ingeborg, Matti, Natalya,

00:00:30.557 --> 00:00:35.317
Nancy, Sheryl, Usman, Zarema,

00:00:35.317 --> 00:00:37.275
and the list is longer.

00:00:38.405 --> 00:00:41.749
For many, their existence,
their humanity,

00:00:41.749 --> 00:00:45.394
has been reduced to statistics,

00:00:45.394 --> 00:00:49.690
coldly recorded as "security incidents."

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:51.245
For me, they were colleagues

00:00:51.245 --> 00:00:54.775
belonging to that community
of humanitarian aid workers

00:00:54.775 --> 00:00:57.584
that tried to bring a bit of comfort

00:00:57.584 --> 00:01:01.671
to the victims of the wars
in Chechnya in the '90s.

00:01:01.671 --> 00:01:06.314
They were nurses, logisticians,
shelter experts,

00:01:06.314 --> 00:01:09.147
paralegals, interpreters.

00:01:09.147 --> 00:01:13.303
And for this service, they were murdered,

00:01:13.303 --> 00:01:15.765
their families torn apart,

00:01:15.765 --> 00:01:17.967
and their story largely forgotten.

00:01:18.977 --> 00:01:22.124
No one was ever sentenced
for these crimes.

00:01:23.034 --> 00:01:25.191
I cannot forget them.

00:01:25.191 --> 00:01:27.240
They live in me somehow,

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.470
their memories giving me
meaning every day.

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:34.901
But they are also haunting
the dark street of my mind.

00:01:34.901 --> 00:01:36.862
As humanitarian aid workers,

00:01:36.862 --> 00:01:40.214
they made the choice
to be at the side of the victim,

00:01:40.214 --> 00:01:44.811
to provide some assistance,
some comfort, some protection,

00:01:44.811 --> 00:01:47.737
but when they needed
protection themselves,

00:01:47.737 --> 00:01:49.445
it wasn't there.

00:01:49.835 --> 00:01:53.008
When you see the headlines
of your newspaper these days

00:01:53.008 --> 00:01:56.073
with the war in Iraq or in Syria --

00:01:56.073 --> 00:02:00.237
aid worker abducted, hostage executed --

00:02:00.237 --> 00:02:02.250
but who were they?

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.175
Why were they there?

00:02:04.175 --> 00:02:06.183
What motivated them?

00:02:06.183 --> 00:02:10.059
How did we become
so indifferent to these crimes?

00:02:10.059 --> 00:02:13.188
This is why I am here today with you.

00:02:13.188 --> 00:02:15.585
We need to find better ways
to remember them.

00:02:16.725 --> 00:02:22.716
We also need to explain the key values
to which they dedicated their lives.

00:02:22.716 --> 00:02:26.928
We also need to demand justice.

00:02:28.208 --> 00:02:30.089
When in '96 I was sent

00:02:30.089 --> 00:02:33.804
by the United Nations High Commissioner
for Refugees to the North Caucasus,

00:02:33.804 --> 00:02:35.676
I knew some of the risks.

00:02:35.676 --> 00:02:38.029
Five colleagues had been killed,

00:02:38.029 --> 00:02:40.096
three had been seriously injured,

00:02:40.096 --> 00:02:42.441
seven had already been taken hostage.

00:02:42.441 --> 00:02:44.228
So we were careful.

00:02:44.228 --> 00:02:48.302
We were using armored 
vehicles, decoy cars,

00:02:48.302 --> 00:02:51.357
changing patterns of travel,
changing homes,

00:02:51.357 --> 00:02:54.148
all sorts of security measures.

00:02:55.408 --> 00:03:01.358
Yet on a cold winter night
of January '98, it was my turn.

00:03:01.358 --> 00:03:05.335
When I entered my flat
in Vladikavkaz with a guard,

00:03:05.335 --> 00:03:07.491
we were surrounded by armed men.

00:03:08.931 --> 00:03:11.148
They took the guard,
they put him on the floor,

00:03:11.148 --> 00:03:13.772
they beat him up in front of me,

00:03:13.772 --> 00:03:16.456
tied him, dragged him away.

00:03:17.686 --> 00:03:22.471
I was handcuffed, blindfolded,
and forced to kneel,

00:03:22.471 --> 00:03:26.354
as the silencer of a gun
pressed against my neck.

00:03:26.354 --> 00:03:28.092
When it happens to you,

00:03:28.092 --> 00:03:31.125
there is no time for thinking,
no time for praying.

00:03:32.195 --> 00:03:34.899
My brain went on automatic,

00:03:34.899 --> 00:03:39.265
rewinding quickly
the life I'd just left behind.

00:03:39.265 --> 00:03:41.795
It took me long minutes to figure out

00:03:41.795 --> 00:03:45.208
that those masked men there
were not there to kill me,

00:03:45.208 --> 00:03:49.381
but that someone, somewhere,
had ordered my kidnapping.

00:03:50.701 --> 00:03:54.772
Then a process of dehumanization
started that day.

00:03:54.772 --> 00:03:59.195
I was no more than just a commodity.

00:04:01.345 --> 00:04:03.161
I normally don't talk about this,

00:04:03.161 --> 00:04:08.178
but I'd like to share a bit with you
some of those 317 days of captivity.

00:04:08.748 --> 00:04:11.804
I was kept in an underground cellar,

00:04:11.804 --> 00:04:13.868
total darkness,

00:04:13.868 --> 00:04:17.622
for 23 hours and 45 minutes every day,

00:04:17.622 --> 00:04:20.908
and then the guards 
would come, normally two.

00:04:20.908 --> 00:04:23.582
They would bring a big piece of bread,

00:04:23.582 --> 00:04:26.086
a bowl of soup, and a candle.

00:04:27.356 --> 00:04:31.430
That candle would burn for 15 minutes,

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:35.238
15 minutes of precious light,

00:04:35.238 --> 00:04:39.374
and then they would take it away,
and I returned to darkness.

00:04:41.174 --> 00:04:44.688
I was chained by a metal cable to my bed.

00:04:44.688 --> 00:04:47.930
I could do only four small steps.

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:52.885
I always dreamt of the fifth one.

00:04:52.885 --> 00:04:57.126
And no TV, no radio,
no newspaper, no one to talk to.

00:04:57.126 --> 00:05:01.219
I had no towel, no soap, no toilet paper,

00:05:01.219 --> 00:05:07.506
just two metal buckets open,
one for water, for one waste.

00:05:10.076 --> 00:05:15.105
Can you imagine that mock execution
can be a pastime for guards

00:05:15.105 --> 00:05:20.414
when they are sadistic
or when they are just bored or drunk?

00:05:21.815 --> 00:05:25.223
We are breaking my nerves very slowly.

00:05:25.223 --> 00:05:29.733
Isolation and darkness
are particularly difficult to describe.

00:05:29.733 --> 00:05:32.125
How do you describe nothing?

00:05:32.125 --> 00:05:35.143
There are no words for the depths
of loneliness I reached

00:05:35.143 --> 00:05:40.268
in that very thin border
between sanity and madness.

00:05:42.318 --> 00:05:47.558
In the darkness, sometimes
I played imaginary games of checkers.

00:05:47.558 --> 00:05:49.761
I would start with the black,

00:05:49.761 --> 00:05:51.420
play with the white,

00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:54.029
back to the black
trying to trick the other side.

00:05:55.619 --> 00:05:59.010
I don't play checkers anymore.

00:05:59.010 --> 00:06:05.327
I was tormented by the thoughts of my
family and my colleague, the guard, Edik.

00:06:05.327 --> 00:06:08.137
I didn't know what had happened to him.

00:06:08.137 --> 00:06:10.622
I was trying not to think,

00:06:10.622 --> 00:06:12.082
I tried to fill up my time

00:06:12.082 --> 00:06:15.893
by doing all sorts of physical
exercise on the spot.

00:06:15.893 --> 00:06:19.833
I tried to pray, I tried all sorts
of memorization games.

00:06:21.213 --> 00:06:25.606
But darkness also creates images
and thoughts that are not normal.

00:06:25.606 --> 00:06:31.867
One part of your brain wants you
to resist, to shout, to cry,

00:06:31.867 --> 00:06:35.304
and the other part of the brain
orders you to shut up

00:06:35.304 --> 00:06:38.113
and just go through it.

00:06:38.113 --> 00:06:41.803
It's a constant internal debate;
there is no one to arbitrate.

00:06:43.313 --> 00:06:48.233
Once a guard came to me,
very aggressively, and he told me,

00:06:48.233 --> 00:06:52.370
"Today you're going to kneel
and beg for your food."

00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:55.992
I wasn't in a good mood,
so I insulted him.

00:06:55.992 --> 00:06:58.926
I insulted his mother,
I insulted his ancestors.

00:06:58.926 --> 00:07:03.357
The consequence was moderate:
he threw the food into my waste.

00:07:03.357 --> 00:07:07.032
The day after he came back
with the same demand.

00:07:07.032 --> 00:07:09.471
He got the same answer,

00:07:09.471 --> 00:07:13.682
which had the same consequence.

00:07:13.682 --> 00:07:17.513
Four days later,
the body was full of pain.

00:07:17.513 --> 00:07:21.855
I didn't know hunger hurt so much
when you have so little.

00:07:21.855 --> 00:07:25.269
So when the guards came down,

00:07:28.199 --> 00:07:31.213
I knelt.

00:07:31.213 --> 00:07:34.231
I begged for my food.

00:07:34.231 --> 00:07:39.818
Submission was the only way for me
to make it to another candle.

00:07:41.452 --> 00:07:43.263
After my kidnapping,

00:07:43.263 --> 00:07:46.420
I was transferred
from North Ossetia to Chechnya,

00:07:46.420 --> 00:07:50.740
three days of slow travel
in the trunks of different cars,

00:07:50.740 --> 00:07:53.039
and upon arrival, I was interrogated

00:07:53.039 --> 00:07:56.704
for 11 days by a guy called Ruslan.

00:07:56.704 --> 00:07:58.468
The routine was always the same:

00:07:58.468 --> 00:08:00.860
a bit more light, 45 minutes.

00:08:00.860 --> 00:08:03.135
He would come down to the cellar,

00:08:03.135 --> 00:08:05.399
he would ask the guards
to tie me on the chair,

00:08:05.399 --> 00:08:08.499
and he would turn on the music loud.

00:08:08.499 --> 00:08:11.680
And then he would yell questions.

00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:14.475
He would scream. He would beat me.

00:08:14.475 --> 00:08:16.378
I'll spare you the details.

00:08:16.398 --> 00:08:18.831
There are many questions
I could not understand,

00:08:18.831 --> 00:08:23.394
and there are some questions
I did not want to understand.

00:08:24.404 --> 00:08:28.583
The length of the interrogation
was the duration of the tape:

00:08:28.583 --> 00:08:31.950
15 songs, 45 minutes.

00:08:31.950 --> 00:08:34.135
I would always long for the last song.

00:08:34.725 --> 00:08:38.430
On one day, one night in that cellar,
I don't know what it was,

00:08:38.430 --> 00:08:41.447
I heard a child crying above my head,

00:08:41.447 --> 00:08:44.279
a boy, maybe two or three years old.

00:08:44.279 --> 00:08:47.926
Footsteps, confusion, people running.

00:08:49.016 --> 00:08:52.050
So when Ruslan came the day after,

00:08:52.050 --> 00:08:54.519
before he put the first question to me,

00:08:54.519 --> 00:08:58.118
I asked him, "How is your son today?
Is he feeling better?"

00:08:58.118 --> 00:09:00.904
Ruslan was taken by surprise.

00:09:00.904 --> 00:09:03.733
He was furious that the guards
may have leaked some details

00:09:03.733 --> 00:09:06.311
about his private life.

00:09:06.311 --> 00:09:11.024
I kept talking about NGOs
supplying medicines to local clinics

00:09:11.024 --> 00:09:13.935
that may help his son to get better.

00:09:13.935 --> 00:09:18.059
And we talked about education,
we talked about families.

00:09:18.059 --> 00:09:19.917
He talked to me about his children.

00:09:19.917 --> 00:09:21.983
I talked to him about my daughters.

00:09:21.983 --> 00:09:25.373
And then he'd talk about guns,
about cars, about women,

00:09:25.373 --> 00:09:29.692
and I had to talk about guns,
about cars, about women.

00:09:29.692 --> 00:09:33.430
And we talked until
the last song on the tape.

00:09:33.430 --> 00:09:39.073
Ruslan was the most brutal man I ever met.

00:09:39.073 --> 00:09:42.370
He did not touch me anymore.

00:09:42.370 --> 00:09:45.086
He did not ask any other questions.

00:09:45.086 --> 00:09:48.941
I was no longer just a commodity.

00:09:48.941 --> 00:09:53.910
Two days after, I was transferred
to another place.

00:09:53.910 --> 00:09:59.016
There, a guard came to me,
very close -- it was quite unusual --

00:09:59.016 --> 00:10:02.175
and he said with
a very soft voice, he said,

00:10:02.175 --> 00:10:04.799
"I'd like to thank you

00:10:04.799 --> 00:10:08.839
for the assistance your organization
provided my family

00:10:08.839 --> 00:10:12.888
when we were displaced
in nearby Dagestan."

00:10:14.458 --> 00:10:18.041
What could I possibly reply?

00:10:18.041 --> 00:10:22.817
It was so painful.
It was like a blade in the belly.

00:10:22.817 --> 00:10:26.161
It took me weeks of internal thinking
to try to reconcile

00:10:26.161 --> 00:10:29.435
the good reasons we had
to assist that family

00:10:29.435 --> 00:10:32.407
and the soldier of fortune he became.

00:10:32.407 --> 00:10:34.520
He was young, he was shy.

00:10:34.520 --> 00:10:36.795
I never saw his face.

00:10:36.795 --> 00:10:39.465
He probably meant well.

00:10:39.465 --> 00:10:41.857
But in those 15 seconds,

00:10:41.857 --> 00:10:45.572
he made me question everything we did,

00:10:45.572 --> 00:10:47.963
all the sacrifices.

00:10:47.963 --> 00:10:51.516
He made me think also how they see us.

00:10:51.516 --> 00:10:54.186
Until then, I had assumed
that they know why we are there

00:10:54.186 --> 00:10:57.065
and what we are doing.

00:10:57.065 --> 00:10:59.918
One cannot assume this.

00:10:59.918 --> 00:11:04.170
Well, explaining why we do this
is not that easy,

00:11:04.170 --> 00:11:05.962
even to our closest relatives.

00:11:07.212 --> 00:11:10.609
We are not perfect, we are not superior,

00:11:10.609 --> 00:11:13.085
we are not the world's fire brigade,

00:11:13.085 --> 00:11:15.199
we are not superheroes,

00:11:15.199 --> 00:11:16.871
we don't stop wars,

00:11:16.871 --> 00:11:22.255
we know that humanitarian response is not
a substitute for political solution.

00:11:22.255 --> 00:11:26.713
Yet we do this because one life matters.

00:11:26.713 --> 00:11:28.966
Sometimes that's the only
difference you make --

00:11:28.966 --> 00:11:32.286
one individual, one family,
a small group of individuals --

00:11:32.286 --> 00:11:34.260
and it matters.

00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:37.117
When you have a tsunami,
an earthquake or a typhoon,

00:11:37.117 --> 00:11:41.225
you see teams of rescuers
coming from all over the world,

00:11:41.225 --> 00:11:44.267
searching for survivors for weeks.

00:11:44.267 --> 00:11:46.821
Why? Nobody questions this.

00:11:46.821 --> 00:11:48.934
Every life matters,

00:11:48.934 --> 00:11:53.160
or every life should matter.

00:11:53.160 --> 00:11:56.085
This is the same for us
when we help refugees,

00:11:56.085 --> 00:12:00.945
people displaced within their country
by conflict, or stateless persons,

00:12:01.745 --> 00:12:03.540
I know many people,

00:12:03.540 --> 00:12:06.548
when they are confronted
by overwhelming suffering,

00:12:06.548 --> 00:12:10.319
they feel powerless and they stop there.

00:12:10.319 --> 00:12:14.196
It's a pity, because there are
so many ways people can help.

00:12:14.196 --> 00:12:16.177
We don't stop with that feeling.

00:12:16.177 --> 00:12:18.828
We try to do whatever we can
to provide some assistance,

00:12:18.828 --> 00:12:21.482
some protection, some comfort.

00:12:21.482 --> 00:12:23.243
We have to.

00:12:23.243 --> 00:12:24.993
We can't do otherwise.

00:12:24.993 --> 00:12:30.347
It's what makes us feel,
I don't know, simply human.

00:12:30.347 --> 00:12:34.466
That's a picture of me
the day of my release.

00:12:34.466 --> 00:12:38.808
Months after my release,
I met the then-French prime minister.

00:12:38.808 --> 00:12:40.850
The second thing he told me:

00:12:40.850 --> 00:12:44.381
"You were totally irresponsible
to go to the North Caucasus.

00:12:44.381 --> 00:12:48.287
You don't know how many
problems you've created for us."

00:12:50.167 --> 00:12:52.002
It was a short meeting.

00:12:52.002 --> 00:12:53.721
(Laughter)

00:12:54.811 --> 00:12:59.385
I think helping people
in danger is responsible.

00:12:59.385 --> 00:13:03.913
In that war, that nobody
seriously wanted to stop,

00:13:03.913 --> 00:13:06.258
and we have many of these today,

00:13:06.258 --> 00:13:10.758
bringing some assistance to people in need
and a bit of protection

00:13:10.758 --> 00:13:12.667
was not just an act of humanity,

00:13:12.667 --> 00:13:15.569
it was making a real difference
for the people.

00:13:15.569 --> 00:13:18.820
Why could he not understand this?

00:13:18.820 --> 00:13:20.747
We have a responsibility to try.

00:13:20.747 --> 00:13:24.581
You've heard about that concept:
Responsibility to Protect.

00:13:24.581 --> 00:13:28.662
Outcomes may depend
on various parameters.

00:13:28.662 --> 00:13:32.519
We may even fail,
but there is worse than failing --

00:13:32.519 --> 00:13:35.270
it's not even trying when we can.

00:13:36.591 --> 00:13:40.466
Well, if you are met this way,
if you sign up for this sort of job,

00:13:40.466 --> 00:13:45.104
your life is going to be full
of joy and sadness,

00:13:45.104 --> 00:13:47.783
because there are a lot of people
we cannot help,

00:13:47.783 --> 00:13:51.707
a lot of people we cannot protect,
a lot of people we did not save.

00:13:51.707 --> 00:13:53.950
I call them my ghost,

00:13:53.950 --> 00:13:56.907
and by having witnessed
their suffering from close,

00:13:56.907 --> 00:14:01.054
you take a bit 
of that suffering on yourself.

00:14:01.454 --> 00:14:04.120
Many young humanitarian workers

00:14:04.120 --> 00:14:07.138
go through their first experience
with a lot of bitterness.

00:14:07.138 --> 00:14:10.110
They are thrown into situations
where they are witness,

00:14:10.110 --> 00:14:13.222
but they are powerless
to bring any change.

00:14:13.222 --> 00:14:15.729
They have to learn to accept it

00:14:15.729 --> 00:14:19.108
and gradually turn this
into positive energy.

00:14:19.108 --> 00:14:20.557
It's difficult.

00:14:20.557 --> 00:14:23.095
Many don't succeed,

00:14:23.095 --> 00:14:27.103
but for those who do,
there is no other job like this.

00:14:27.103 --> 00:14:30.883
You can see the difference
you make every day.

00:14:31.793 --> 00:14:34.955
Humanitarian aid workers
know the risk they are taking

00:14:34.955 --> 00:14:39.867
in conflict areas or 
in post-conflict environments,

00:14:39.867 --> 00:14:46.579
yet our life, our job, is becoming 
increasingly life-threatening,

00:14:46.579 --> 00:14:49.761
and the sanctity of our life is fading.

00:14:51.591 --> 00:14:54.250
Do you know that since the millennium,

00:14:54.250 --> 00:14:58.569
the number of attacks on humanitarian 
aid workers has tripled?

00:14:59.559 --> 00:15:02.191
2013 broke new records:

00:15:03.261 --> 00:15:06.533
155 colleagues killed,

00:15:06.533 --> 00:15:09.667
171 seriously wounded,

00:15:09.667 --> 00:15:13.125
134 abducted.

00:15:13.525 --> 00:15:17.328
So many broken lives.

00:15:17.328 --> 00:15:22.530
Until the beginning of the civil war
in Somalia in the late '80s,

00:15:22.530 --> 00:15:26.640
humanitarian aid workers
were sometimes victims

00:15:26.640 --> 00:15:28.637
of what we call collateral damages,

00:15:28.637 --> 00:15:32.352
but by and large we were not
the target of these attacks.

00:15:32.352 --> 00:15:33.906
This has changed.

00:15:33.906 --> 00:15:35.182
Look at this picture.

00:15:35.182 --> 00:15:38.016
Baghdad, August 2003:

00:15:38.016 --> 00:15:40.781
24 colleagues were killed.

00:15:40.781 --> 00:15:44.307
Gone are the days when
a U.N. blue flag or a Red Cross

00:15:44.307 --> 00:15:48.083
would automatically protect us.

00:15:48.083 --> 00:15:51.345
Criminal groups and some political groups

00:15:51.345 --> 00:15:54.201
have cross-fertilized
over the last 20 years,

00:15:54.201 --> 00:15:57.336
and they've created these sort of hybrids

00:15:57.336 --> 00:16:00.202
with whom we have no way of communicating.

00:16:00.202 --> 00:16:05.576
Humanitarian principles are tested,
questioned, and often ignored,

00:16:05.576 --> 00:16:10.462
but perhaps more importantly,
we have abandoned the search for justice.

00:16:10.462 --> 00:16:13.682
There seems to be
no consequence whatsoever

00:16:13.682 --> 00:16:17.147
for attacks against
humanitarian aid workers.

00:16:17.147 --> 00:16:21.507
After my release, I was told
not to seek any form of justice.

00:16:21.507 --> 00:16:24.734
It won't do you any good,
that's what I was told.

00:16:24.734 --> 00:16:28.823
Plus, you're going to put in danger
the life of other colleagues.

00:16:29.873 --> 00:16:33.034
It took me years to see the sentencing

00:16:33.034 --> 00:16:37.325
of three people associated 
with my kidnapping,

00:16:37.325 --> 00:16:39.861
but this was the exception.

00:16:39.861 --> 00:16:44.380
There was no justice for any 
of the humanitarian aid workers

00:16:44.380 --> 00:16:48.668
killed or abducted in Chechnya
between '95 and '99,

00:16:48.668 --> 00:16:51.296
and it's the same all over the world.

00:16:52.586 --> 00:16:54.733
This is unacceptable.

00:16:54.733 --> 00:16:56.544
This is inexcusable.

00:16:56.544 --> 00:17:01.257
Attacks on humanitarian aid workers
are war crimes in international law.

00:17:01.257 --> 00:17:04.345
Those crimes should not go unpunished.

00:17:04.345 --> 00:17:07.085
We must end this cycle of impunity.

00:17:07.085 --> 00:17:10.916
We must consider that those attacks
against humanitarian aid workers

00:17:10.916 --> 00:17:14.469
are attacks against humanity itself.

00:17:14.469 --> 00:17:18.094
That makes me furious.

00:17:18.424 --> 00:17:23.138
I know I'm very lucky
compared to the refugees I work for.

00:17:24.564 --> 00:17:28.191
I don't know what it is to have seen
my whole town destroyed.

00:17:28.191 --> 00:17:32.255
I don't know what it is to have seen
my relatives shot in front of me.

00:17:32.255 --> 00:17:36.504
I don't know what it is to lose
the protection of my country.

00:17:36.504 --> 00:17:40.799
I also know that I'm very lucky
compared to other hostages.

00:17:40.799 --> 00:17:46.481
Four days before my eventful release,
four hostages were beheaded

00:17:46.481 --> 00:17:50.876
a few miles away from where
I was kept in captivity.

00:17:50.876 --> 00:17:53.080
Why them?

00:17:53.080 --> 00:17:55.741
Why am I here today?

00:17:56.791 --> 00:18:00.580
No easy answer.

00:18:00.580 --> 00:18:04.193
I was received with a lot of support
that I got from my relatives,

00:18:04.193 --> 00:18:08.012
from colleagues, from friends,
from people I didn't know.

00:18:08.012 --> 00:18:11.531
They have helped me over the years
to come out of the darkness.

00:18:12.441 --> 00:18:15.709
Not everyone was treated
with the same attention.

00:18:16.339 --> 00:18:19.964
How many of my colleagues,
after a traumatic incident,

00:18:19.964 --> 00:18:23.240
took their own life?

00:18:23.240 --> 00:18:26.969
I can count nine that I knew personally.

00:18:26.969 --> 00:18:30.697
How many of my colleagues
went through a difficult divorce

00:18:30.697 --> 00:18:33.631
after a traumatic experience

00:18:33.631 --> 00:18:38.359
because they could not explain
anything anymore to their spouse?

00:18:38.359 --> 00:18:40.813
I've lost that count.

00:18:40.813 --> 00:18:44.373
There is a price for this type of life.

00:18:44.373 --> 00:18:49.006
In Russia, all war monuments have
this beautiful inscription at the top.

00:18:49.006 --> 00:18:53.115
It says, (In Russian)

00:18:53.115 --> 00:18:56.366
"No one is forgotten,
nothing is forgotten."

00:18:57.536 --> 00:19:00.673
I do not forget my lost colleagues.

00:19:00.673 --> 00:19:03.009
I cannot forget anything.

00:19:03.009 --> 00:19:06.222
I call on you to remember their dedication

00:19:06.222 --> 00:19:09.728
and demand that humanitarian
aid workers around the world

00:19:09.728 --> 00:19:12.305
be better protected.

00:19:12.305 --> 00:19:17.901
We should not let that light of hope
they have brought to be switched off.

00:19:17.901 --> 00:19:22.591
After my ordeal, a lot of colleagues
asked me, "But why do you continue?

00:19:22.591 --> 00:19:24.797
Why do you do this sort of job?

00:19:24.797 --> 00:19:27.351
Why do you have to go back to it?"

00:19:27.351 --> 00:19:29.846
My answer was very simple:

00:19:30.216 --> 00:19:32.686
If I had quit,

00:19:32.686 --> 00:19:36.703
that would have meant
my kidnapper had won.

00:19:36.703 --> 00:19:39.054
They would have taken my soul

00:19:39.054 --> 00:19:41.329
and my humanity.

00:19:41.329 --> 00:19:43.976
Thank you.

00:19:43.976 --> 00:19:46.143
(Applause)
