00:00:13.857 --> 00:00:16.746
People back home call me a heckler,

00:00:16.746 --> 00:00:19.463
a troublemaker, an irritant,

00:00:19.463 --> 00:00:22.133
a rebel, an activist,

00:00:22.133 --> 00:00:23.990
the voice of the people.

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:26.160
But that wasn't always me.

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:28.332
Growing up, I had a nickname.

00:00:28.332 --> 00:00:30.652
They used to call me Softy,

00:00:30.652 --> 00:00:33.905
meaning the soft, harmless boy.

00:00:33.905 --> 00:00:36.645
Like every other human being,
I avoided trouble.

00:00:36.645 --> 00:00:38.688
In my childhood, they taught me silence.

00:00:38.688 --> 00:00:40.490
Don't argue, do as you're told.

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:44.422
In Sunday school, they taught me
don't confront, don't argue,

00:00:44.422 --> 00:00:47.735
even if you're right,
turn the other cheek.

00:00:47.735 --> 00:00:52.332
This was reinforced
by the political climate of the time.

00:00:52.332 --> 00:00:55.933
(Laughter)

00:00:55.933 --> 00:00:57.742
Kenya is a country
where you are guilty

00:00:57.742 --> 00:01:00.389
until proven rich.

00:01:00.389 --> 00:01:03.134
(Laughter)

00:01:03.134 --> 00:01:05.876
Kenya's poor are five times more likely

00:01:05.876 --> 00:01:08.800
to be shot dead by the police
who are meant to protect them

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:10.448
than by criminals.

00:01:10.448 --> 00:01:13.095
This was reinforced
by the political climate of the day.

00:01:13.095 --> 00:01:16.044
We had a president,
Moi, who was a dictator.

00:01:16.044 --> 00:01:18.250
He ruled the country with an iron fist,

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:20.688
and anyone who dared
question his authority

00:01:20.688 --> 00:01:25.657
was arrested, tortured,
jailed or even killed.

00:01:25.657 --> 00:01:29.581
That meant that people were taught
to be smart cowards, stay out of trouble.

00:01:29.581 --> 00:01:31.624
Being a coward was not an insult.

00:01:31.624 --> 00:01:33.551
Being a coward was a compliment.

00:01:33.551 --> 00:01:36.709
We used to be told that a coward
goes home to his mother.

00:01:36.709 --> 00:01:40.470
What that meant: that if you stayed
out of trouble you're going to stay alive.

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.410
I used to question this advice,

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:45.232
and eight years ago
we had an election in Kenya,

00:01:45.232 --> 00:01:47.715
and the results were violently disputed.

00:01:47.715 --> 00:01:52.452
What followed that election
was terrible violence, rape,

00:01:52.452 --> 00:01:56.389
and the killing of over 1,000 people.

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:59.510
My work was to document the violence.

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:02.366
As a photographer,
I took thousands of images,

00:02:02.366 --> 00:02:04.433
and after two months,

00:02:04.433 --> 00:02:09.308
the two politicians came together,
had a cup of tea,

00:02:09.308 --> 00:02:12.745
signed a peace agreement,
and the country moved on.

00:02:12.745 --> 00:02:16.274
I was a very disturbed man
because I saw the violence firsthand.

00:02:16.274 --> 00:02:19.880
I saw the killings.
I saw the displacement.

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:22.961
I met women who had been raped,
and it disturbed me,

00:02:22.961 --> 00:02:25.005
but the country never spoke about it.

00:02:25.005 --> 00:02:27.489
We pretended. We all became smart cowards.

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:31.088
We decided to stay out of trouble
and not talk about it.

00:02:31.088 --> 00:02:34.385
Ten months later, I quit my job.
I said I could not stand it anymore.

00:02:34.385 --> 00:02:36.980
After quitting my job,
I decided to organize my friends

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:39.000
to speak about
the violence in the country,

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.864
to speak about the state of the nation,

00:02:40.864 --> 00:02:44.980
and June 1, 2009 was the day
that we were meant to go to the stadium

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:47.039
and try and get the president's attention.

00:02:47.039 --> 00:02:48.479
It's a national holiday,

00:02:48.479 --> 00:02:50.128
it's broadcast across the country,

00:02:50.128 --> 00:02:53.536
and I showed up at the stadium.

00:02:53.536 --> 00:02:56.530
My friends did not show up.

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:59.903
I found myself alone,

00:02:59.903 --> 00:03:02.430
and I didn't know what to do.

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:03.845
I was scared,

00:03:03.845 --> 00:03:06.015
but I knew very well
that that particular day,

00:03:06.015 --> 00:03:07.236
I had to make a decision.

00:03:07.236 --> 00:03:09.659
Was I able to live as a coward,
like everyone else,

00:03:09.659 --> 00:03:11.257
or was I going to make a stand?

00:03:11.257 --> 00:03:13.463
And when the president stood up to speak,

00:03:13.463 --> 00:03:18.070
I found myself on my feet
shouting at the president,

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:21.264
telling him to remember
the post-election violence victims,

00:03:21.264 --> 00:03:23.540
to stop the corruption.

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:25.745
And suddenly, out of nowhere,

00:03:25.745 --> 00:03:28.857
the police pounced on me
like hungry lions.

00:03:28.857 --> 00:03:30.714
They held my mouth

00:03:30.714 --> 00:03:32.641
and dragged me out of the stadium,

00:03:32.641 --> 00:03:35.612
where they thoroughly beat me up
and locked me up in jail.

00:03:37.262 --> 00:03:44.020
I spent that night in
a cold cement floor in the jail,

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:46.668
and that got me thinking.

00:03:46.668 --> 00:03:48.539
What was making me feel this way?

00:03:48.539 --> 00:03:51.704
My friends and family thought
I was crazy because of what I did,

00:03:51.704 --> 00:03:56.718
and the images that I took
were disturbing my life.

00:03:56.718 --> 00:03:59.668
The images that I took
were just a number to many Kenyans.

00:03:59.668 --> 00:04:01.615
Most Kenyans did not see the violence.

00:04:01.615 --> 00:04:03.310
It was a story to them.

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:06.097
And so I decided to actually
start a street exhibition

00:04:06.097 --> 00:04:08.883
to show the images of the violence
across the country

00:04:08.883 --> 00:04:10.857
and get people talking about it.

00:04:10.857 --> 00:04:13.666
We traveled the country
and showed the images,

00:04:13.666 --> 00:04:17.149
and this was a journey that has started me
to the activist path,

00:04:17.149 --> 00:04:19.866
where I decided to become silent no more,

00:04:19.866 --> 00:04:22.064
to talk about those things.

00:04:22.064 --> 00:04:25.714
We traveled, and our general site
from our street exhibit

00:04:25.714 --> 00:04:30.512
became for political graffiti
about the situation in the country,

00:04:30.512 --> 00:04:33.270
talking about corruption, bad leadership.

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:37.050
We have even done symbolic burials.

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:41.032
We have delivered live pigs
to Kenya's parliament

00:04:41.032 --> 00:04:42.960
as a symbol of our politicians' greed.

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:45.191
It has been done in Uganda
and other countries,

00:04:45.191 --> 00:04:48.700
and what is most powerful is that
the images have been picked by the media

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:51.736
and amplified across the country,
across the continent.

00:04:51.736 --> 00:04:54.383
Where I used to stand up alone
seven years ago,

00:04:54.383 --> 00:04:57.409
now I belong to a community
of many people who stand up with me.

00:04:57.409 --> 00:05:01.737
I am no longer alone when I stand up
to speak about these things.

00:05:02.327 --> 00:05:06.500
I belong to a group of young people
who are passionate about the country,

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:08.350
who want to bring about change,

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:12.764
and they're no longer afraid,
and they're no longer smart cowards.

00:05:13.894 --> 00:05:16.622
So that was my story.

00:05:18.392 --> 00:05:20.990
That day in the stadium,

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:23.477
I stood up as a smart coward.

00:05:23.477 --> 00:05:28.724
By that one action, I said goodbye
to the 24 years living as a coward.

00:05:28.724 --> 00:05:31.766
There are two most powerful
days in your life:

00:05:31.766 --> 00:05:36.312
the day you're born,
and the day you discover why.

00:05:36.921 --> 00:05:40.165
That day standing up in that stadium
shouting at the President,

00:05:40.165 --> 00:05:43.445
I discovered why I was truly born,

00:05:43.445 --> 00:05:46.696
that I would no longer be silent
in the face of injustice.

00:05:47.926 --> 00:05:50.730
Do you know why you were born?

00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:53.685
Thank you.

00:05:53.685 --> 00:05:58.604
(Applause)

00:06:00.674 --> 00:06:03.181
Tom Rielly: It's an amazing story.

00:06:03.181 --> 00:06:05.737
I just want to ask you
a couple quick questions.

00:06:05.737 --> 00:06:08.057
So PAWA254:

00:06:08.057 --> 00:06:12.370
you've created a studio, a place
where young people can go

00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:14.326
and harness the power of digital media

00:06:14.326 --> 00:06:16.837
to do some of this action.

00:06:16.837 --> 00:06:18.714
What's happening now with PAWA?

00:06:18.714 --> 00:06:21.497
Boniface Mwangi: So we have 
this community of filmmakers,

00:06:21.497 --> 00:06:24.860
graffiti artists, musicians,
and when there's an issue in the country,

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:27.661
we come together, we brainstorm,
and take up on that issue.

00:06:27.661 --> 00:06:29.717
So our most powerful tool is art,

00:06:29.717 --> 00:06:33.548
because we live in a very busy world
where people are so busy in their life,

00:06:33.548 --> 00:06:35.615
and they don't have time to read.

00:06:35.615 --> 00:06:39.748
So we package our activism
and we package our message in art.

00:06:39.748 --> 00:06:44.727
So from the music, the graffiti, 
the art, that's what we do.

00:06:45.707 --> 00:06:47.735
Can I say one more thing?

00:06:47.735 --> 00:06:49.616
TR: Yeah, of course. (Applause)

00:06:49.616 --> 00:06:52.251
BM: In spite of being arrested,
beaten up, threatened,

00:06:52.251 --> 00:06:53.964
the moment I discovered my voice,

00:06:53.964 --> 00:06:56.860
that I could actually stand up
for what I really believed in,

00:06:56.860 --> 00:06:57.898
I'm no longer afraid.

00:06:57.898 --> 00:07:00.640
I used to be called softy,
but I'm no longer softy,

00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:04.041
because I discovered who I really am,
as in, that's what I want to do,

00:07:04.041 --> 00:07:07.077
and there's such beauty in doing that.

00:07:07.077 --> 00:07:10.466
There's nothing as powerful as that,
knowing that I'm meant to do this,

00:07:10.466 --> 00:07:13.613
because you don't get scared,
you just continue living your life.

00:07:13.613 --> 00:07:15.799
Thank you.

00:07:15.799 --> 00:07:19.389
(Applause)
