00:00:13.261 --> 00:00:18.601
Today, I am going to talk about anger.

00:00:21.278 --> 00:00:23.280
When I was 11,

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:26.612
seeing some of my friends 
leaving the school

00:00:26.612 --> 00:00:30.834
because their parents 
could not afford textbooks

00:00:30.834 --> 00:00:33.336
made me angry.

00:00:35.466 --> 00:00:38.218
When I was 27,

00:00:38.218 --> 00:00:43.430
hearing the plight
of a desperate slave father

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:48.442
whose daughter was 
about to be sold to a brothel

00:00:48.452 --> 00:00:50.833
made me angry.

00:00:52.573 --> 00:00:54.913
At the age of 50,

00:00:54.913 --> 00:00:59.736
lying on the street,
in a pool of blood,

00:00:59.736 --> 00:01:02.682
along with my own son,

00:01:02.682 --> 00:01:05.149
made me angry.

00:01:07.449 --> 00:01:12.634
Dear friends, for centuries
we were taught anger is bad.

00:01:13.424 --> 00:01:15.636
Our parents, teachers, priests --

00:01:15.636 --> 00:01:21.521
everyone taught us how to control 
and suppress our anger.

00:01:24.391 --> 00:01:26.296
But I ask why?

00:01:27.746 --> 00:01:32.663
Why can't we convert our anger
for the larger good of society?

00:01:32.663 --> 00:01:34.259
Why can't we use our anger

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:37.765
to challenge and change
the evils of the world?

00:01:41.855 --> 00:01:44.326
That I tried to do.

00:01:46.186 --> 00:01:47.997
Friends,

00:01:49.517 --> 00:01:55.520
most of the brightest ideas
came to my mind out of anger.

00:01:55.964 --> 00:02:05.664
Like when I was 35 and sat 
in a locked-up, tiny prison.

00:02:06.714 --> 00:02:09.217
The whole night, I was angry.

00:02:10.107 --> 00:02:13.167
But it has given birth to a new idea.

00:02:13.167 --> 00:02:16.326
But I will come to that later on.

00:02:16.326 --> 00:02:23.191
Let me begin with the story
of how I got a name for myself.

00:02:25.631 --> 00:02:29.772
I had been a big admirer 
of Mahatma Gandhi since my childhood.

00:02:31.182 --> 00:02:36.471
Gandhi fought and lead 
India's freedom movement.

00:02:37.411 --> 00:02:39.449
But more importantly,

00:02:39.449 --> 00:02:46.184
he taught us how to treat 
the most vulnerable sections,

00:02:46.184 --> 00:02:50.455
the most deprived people, 
with dignity and respect.

00:02:51.745 --> 00:02:56.712
And so, when India was celebrating

00:02:56.712 --> 00:02:59.979
Mahatma Gandhi's 
birth centenary in 1969 --

00:02:59.979 --> 00:03:02.267
at that time I was 15 --

00:03:02.267 --> 00:03:04.624
an idea came to my mind.

00:03:05.924 --> 00:03:09.394
Why can't we celebrate it differently?

00:03:09.394 --> 00:03:14.822
I knew, as perhaps
many of you might know,

00:03:14.822 --> 00:03:22.815
that in India, a large number of people
are born in the lowest segment of caste.

00:03:24.335 --> 00:03:27.474
And they are treated as untouchables.

00:03:27.474 --> 00:03:28.806
These are the people --

00:03:28.806 --> 00:03:33.216
forget about allowing them 
to go to the temples,

00:03:33.216 --> 00:03:40.400
they cannot even go into the houses 
and shops of high-caste people.

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:45.714
So I was very impressed with 
the leaders of my town

00:03:45.714 --> 00:03:50.252
who were speaking very highly against
the caste system and untouchability

00:03:50.252 --> 00:03:52.424
and talking of Gandhian ideals.

00:03:53.924 --> 00:03:57.094
So inspired by that, I thought,
let us set an example

00:03:57.094 --> 00:04:03.539
by inviting these people to eat food
cooked and served

00:04:03.539 --> 00:04:06.769
by the untouchable community.

00:04:06.769 --> 00:04:11.701
I went to some low-caste,
so-called untouchable, people,

00:04:13.571 --> 00:04:17.957
tried to convince them,
but it was unthinkable for them.

00:04:17.957 --> 00:04:21.910
They told me, "No, no. It's not possible.
It never happened."

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:24.934
I said, "Look at these leaders,

00:04:24.934 --> 00:04:27.371
they are so great, 
they are against untouchability.

00:04:27.371 --> 00:04:30.061
They will come. If nobody comes, 
we can set an example."

00:04:33.041 --> 00:04:38.901
These people thought that I was too naive.

00:04:40.311 --> 00:04:42.801
Finally, they were convinced.

00:04:42.801 --> 00:04:48.502
My friends and I took our bicycles
and invited political leaders.

00:04:50.132 --> 00:04:53.276
And I was so thrilled, rather, empowered

00:04:53.276 --> 00:04:57.872
to see that each one of them 
agreed to come.

00:04:59.342 --> 00:05:02.233
I thought, "Great idea.
We can set an example.

00:05:02.233 --> 00:05:05.861
We can bring about change in the society."

00:05:07.601 --> 00:05:09.154
The day has come.

00:05:09.874 --> 00:05:15.617
All these untouchables,
three women and two men,

00:05:15.617 --> 00:05:18.966
they agreed to come.

00:05:19.586 --> 00:05:25.225
I could recall that they had used 
the best of their clothes.

00:05:26.625 --> 00:05:28.890
They brought new utensils.

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:32.489
They had taken baths 
hundreds of times

00:05:32.489 --> 00:05:35.450
because it was unthinkable
for them to do.

00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:38.094
It was the moment of change.

00:05:39.404 --> 00:05:41.852
They gathered. Food was cooked.

00:05:42.552 --> 00:05:45.150
It was 7 o'clock.

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:48.026
By 8 o'clock, we kept on waiting,

00:05:48.026 --> 00:05:53.007
because it's not very uncommon 
that the leaders become late,

00:05:53.007 --> 00:05:54.689
for an hour or so.

00:05:55.389 --> 00:06:02.072
So after 8 o'clock, we took our bicycles
and went to these leaders' homes,

00:06:02.072 --> 00:06:04.428
just to remind them.

00:06:06.398 --> 00:06:11.095
One of the leader's wives told me,

00:06:11.095 --> 00:06:16.110
"Sorry, he is having some headache,
perhaps he cannot come."

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:18.187
I went to another leader

00:06:18.187 --> 00:06:22.247
and his wife told me, 
"Okay, you go, he will definitely join."

00:06:23.507 --> 00:06:27.619
So I thought that the dinner
will take place,

00:06:27.619 --> 00:06:32.102
though not at that large a scale.

00:06:33.502 --> 00:06:39.469
I went back to the venue, which was
a newly built Mahatma Gandhi Park.

00:06:40.709 --> 00:06:42.203
It was 10 o'clock.

00:06:43.633 --> 00:06:46.972
None of the leaders showed up.

00:06:48.282 --> 00:06:50.985
That made me angry.

00:06:52.425 --> 00:06:58.829
I was standing, leaning against
Mahatma Gandhi's statue.

00:07:01.989 --> 00:07:06.460
I was emotionally drained,
rather exhausted.

00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:14.525
Then I sat down where 
the food was lying.

00:07:17.845 --> 00:07:19.935
I kept my emotions on hold.

00:07:19.935 --> 00:07:24.429
But then, when I took the first bite,

00:07:24.429 --> 00:07:27.360
I broke down in tears.

00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:32.299
And suddenly I felt a hand on my shoulder.

00:07:32.299 --> 00:07:38.197
And it was the healing, motherly touch 
of an untouchable woman.

00:07:38.197 --> 00:07:42.428
And she told me,
"Kailash, why are you crying?

00:07:43.748 --> 00:07:46.161
You have done your bit.

00:07:46.161 --> 00:07:49.286
You have eaten the food
cooked by untouchables,

00:07:49.286 --> 00:07:52.277
which has never happened in our memory."

00:07:53.357 --> 00:07:57.939
She said, "You won today."

00:07:57.939 --> 00:08:02.909
And my friends, she was right.

00:08:04.209 --> 00:08:07.939
I came back home, a little after midnight,

00:08:07.939 --> 00:08:12.513
shocked to see that several 
high-caste elderly people

00:08:12.513 --> 00:08:14.667
were sitting in my courtyard.

00:08:14.667 --> 00:08:17.763
I saw my mother and 
elderly women were crying

00:08:17.763 --> 00:08:22.221
and they were pleading 
to these elderly people

00:08:22.221 --> 00:08:25.155
because they had threatened 
to outcaste my whole family.

00:08:26.495 --> 00:08:31.627
And you know, outcasting the family
is the biggest social punishment

00:08:31.627 --> 00:08:34.181
one can think of.

00:08:36.131 --> 00:08:40.971
Somehow they agreed to punish only me,
and the punishment was purification.

00:08:40.971 --> 00:08:45.486
That means I had to go 600 miles
away from my hometown

00:08:45.486 --> 00:08:49.417
to the River Ganges to take a holy dip.

00:08:49.417 --> 00:08:53.841
And after that, I should organize a feast
for priests, 101 priests,

00:08:53.841 --> 00:08:57.389
wash their feet and drink that water.

00:08:58.679 --> 00:09:01.678
It was total nonsense,

00:09:01.678 --> 00:09:04.567
and I refused to accept that punishment.

00:09:05.417 --> 00:09:07.547
How did they punish me?

00:09:07.547 --> 00:09:13.344
I was barred from entering into my own 
kitchen and my own dining room,

00:09:13.344 --> 00:09:16.396
my utensils were separated.

00:09:16.396 --> 00:09:21.450
But the night when I was angry,
they wanted to outcaste me.

00:09:22.750 --> 00:09:26.783
But I decided to outcaste 
the entire caste system.

00:09:27.653 --> 00:09:32.378
(Applause)

00:09:33.138 --> 00:09:38.153
And that was possible because
the beginning would have been

00:09:38.153 --> 00:09:40.269
to change the family name, or surname,

00:09:40.269 --> 00:09:43.934
because in India, most of
the family names are caste names.

00:09:43.934 --> 00:09:46.456
So I decided to drop my name.

00:09:46.456 --> 00:09:52.960
And then, later on, I gave 
a new name to myself: Satyarthi,

00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:55.926
that means, "seeker of truth."

00:09:57.366 --> 00:10:01.398
(Applause)

00:10:01.398 --> 00:10:04.735
And that was the beginning 
of my transformative anger.

00:10:06.245 --> 00:10:08.854
Friends, maybe one of you can tell me,

00:10:08.854 --> 00:10:13.680
what was I doing before becoming
a children's rights activist?

00:10:14.560 --> 00:10:15.938
Does anybody know?

00:10:17.048 --> 00:10:18.319
No.

00:10:18.319 --> 00:10:24.708
I was an engineer, an electrical engineer.

00:10:24.708 --> 00:10:29.812
And then I learned how the energy

00:10:29.812 --> 00:10:34.296
of burning fire, coal,

00:10:34.296 --> 00:10:38.400
the nuclear blast inside the chambers,

00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:41.592
raging river currents,

00:10:41.592 --> 00:10:45.216
fierce winds,

00:10:45.216 --> 00:10:50.233
could be converted into the light 
and lives of millions.

00:10:51.113 --> 00:10:55.645
I also learned how the most
uncontrollable form of energy

00:10:55.645 --> 00:11:00.120
could be harnessed for good 
and making society better.

00:11:05.075 --> 00:11:11.842
So I'll come back to the story
of when I was caught in the prison:

00:11:11.842 --> 00:11:16.069
I was very happy freeing 
a dozen children from slavery,

00:11:16.069 --> 00:11:19.040
handing them over to their parents.

00:11:19.040 --> 00:11:22.228
I cannot explain my joy 
when I free a child.

00:11:23.388 --> 00:11:24.578
I was so happy.

00:11:25.608 --> 00:11:31.171
But when I was waiting for my train
to come back to my hometown, Delhi,

00:11:31.171 --> 00:11:34.414
I saw that dozens of children 
were arriving;

00:11:34.414 --> 00:11:37.712
they were being trafficked by someone.

00:11:37.712 --> 00:11:40.565
I stopped them, those people.

00:11:40.565 --> 00:11:42.667
I complained to the police.

00:11:42.667 --> 00:11:47.221
So the policemen, instead of helping me,

00:11:47.221 --> 00:11:52.923
they threw me in this small, 
tiny shell, like an animal.

00:11:53.723 --> 00:11:55.271
And that was the night of anger

00:11:55.271 --> 00:11:59.122
when one of the brightest 
and biggest ideas was born.

00:11:59.782 --> 00:12:05.250
I thought that if I keep on freeing 10 
children, and 50 more will join,

00:12:05.250 --> 00:12:06.710
that's not done.

00:12:06.710 --> 00:12:09.518
And I believed in the power of consumers,

00:12:09.518 --> 00:12:13.002
and let me tell you that this
was the first time

00:12:13.002 --> 00:12:18.118
when a campaign was launched by me
or anywhere in the world,

00:12:18.118 --> 00:12:22.191
to educate and sensitize the consumers

00:12:22.191 --> 00:12:26.651
to create a demand
for child-labor-free rugs.

00:12:27.841 --> 00:12:31.233
In Europe and America, 
we have been successful.

00:12:31.233 --> 00:12:35.918
And it has resulted 
in a fall in child labor

00:12:35.918 --> 00:12:39.174
in South Asian countries by 80 percent.

00:12:39.174 --> 00:12:42.556
(Applause)

00:12:44.886 --> 00:12:51.547
Not only that, but this first-ever 
consumer's power, or consumer's campaign

00:12:51.547 --> 00:12:55.655
has grown in other countries
and other industries,

00:12:55.655 --> 00:13:01.081
maybe chocolate, maybe apparel, 
maybe shoes -- it has gone beyond.

00:13:03.421 --> 00:13:04.973
My anger at the age of 11,

00:13:04.973 --> 00:13:10.326
when I realized how important
education is for every child,

00:13:10.326 --> 00:13:17.971
I got an idea to collect used books
and help the poorest children.

00:13:17.971 --> 00:13:21.420
I created a book bank at the age of 11.

00:13:22.720 --> 00:13:23.963
But I did not stop.

00:13:23.963 --> 00:13:26.196
Later on, I cofounded

00:13:26.196 --> 00:13:30.730
the world's single largest civil society
campaign for education

00:13:30.730 --> 00:13:33.721
that is the Global Campaign for Education.

00:13:34.371 --> 00:13:39.016
That has helped in changing 
the whole thinking towards education

00:13:39.016 --> 00:13:41.407
from the charity mode
to the human rights mode,

00:13:41.407 --> 00:13:46.176
and that has concretely helped 
the reduction of out-of-school children

00:13:46.176 --> 00:13:49.764
by half in the last 15 years.

00:13:49.764 --> 00:13:53.843
(Applause)

00:13:55.903 --> 00:13:59.017
My anger at the age of 27,

00:13:59.017 --> 00:14:04.385
to free that girl who was about
to be sold to a brothel,

00:14:04.385 --> 00:14:09.168
has given me an idea

00:14:09.168 --> 00:14:13.421
to go for a new strategy
of raid and rescue,

00:14:13.421 --> 00:14:16.338
freeing children from slavery.

00:14:16.908 --> 00:14:22.764
And I am so lucky and proud to say
that it is not one or 10 or 20,

00:14:22.764 --> 00:14:29.107
but my colleagues and I have been able
to physically liberate 83,000 child slaves

00:14:29.112 --> 00:14:32.243
and hand them over
back to their families and mothers.

00:14:32.243 --> 00:14:35.602
(Applause)

00:14:37.842 --> 00:14:40.129
I knew that we needed global policies.

00:14:40.129 --> 00:14:43.161
We organized the worldwide marches
against child labor

00:14:43.161 --> 00:14:49.223
and that has also resulted in 
a new international convention

00:14:49.223 --> 00:14:53.322
to protect the children
who are in the worst forms.

00:14:54.412 --> 00:14:58.501
And the concrete result was that
the number of child laborers globally

00:14:58.501 --> 00:15:04.041
has gone down by one third 
in the last 15 years.

00:15:04.041 --> 00:15:08.461
(Applause)

00:15:08.461 --> 00:15:11.871
So, in each case,

00:15:11.871 --> 00:15:15.660
it began from anger,

00:15:15.660 --> 00:15:18.309
turned into an idea,

00:15:18.309 --> 00:15:21.715
and action.

00:15:21.715 --> 00:15:24.591
So anger, what next?

00:15:24.591 --> 00:15:27.070
Idea, and --

00:15:27.070 --> 00:15:28.428
Audience: Action

00:15:28.428 --> 00:15:32.985
Kailash Satyarthi: Anger, idea, action.
Which I tried to do.

00:15:34.404 --> 00:15:36.901
Anger is a power, anger is an energy,

00:15:36.901 --> 00:15:39.702
and the law of nature is that energy

00:15:39.702 --> 00:15:44.945
can never be created and never 
be vanished, can never be destroyed.

00:15:44.945 --> 00:15:51.835
So why can't the energy of anger
be translated and harnessed

00:15:51.835 --> 00:15:56.371
to create a better and beautiful world,
a more just and equitable world?

00:15:57.011 --> 00:15:59.491
Anger is within each one of you,

00:15:59.491 --> 00:16:05.391
and I will share a secret
for a few seconds:

00:16:05.391 --> 00:16:12.945
that if we are confined in 
the narrow shells of egos,

00:16:12.945 --> 00:16:17.375
and the circles of selfishness,

00:16:17.375 --> 00:16:24.859
then the anger will turn out to be
hatred, violence, revenge, destruction.

00:16:25.689 --> 00:16:28.745
But if we are able to break the circles,

00:16:28.745 --> 00:16:34.631
then the same anger could turn 
into a great power.

00:16:34.631 --> 00:16:38.978
We can break the circles 
by using our inherent compassion

00:16:38.978 --> 00:16:42.828
and connect with the world through 
compassion to make this world better.

00:16:42.828 --> 00:16:46.501
That same anger could be
transformed into it.

00:16:46.501 --> 00:16:51.086
So dear friends, sisters and brothers,
again, as a Nobel Laureate,

00:16:52.106 --> 00:16:54.861
I am urging you to become angry.

00:16:55.991 --> 00:16:59.133
I am urging you to become angry.

00:17:00.153 --> 00:17:04.449
And the angriest among us

00:17:04.449 --> 00:17:11.660
is the one who can transform his anger 
into idea and action.

00:17:12.590 --> 00:17:14.425
Thank you so much.

00:17:14.425 --> 00:17:18.395
(Applause)

00:17:27.265 --> 00:17:31.074
Chris Anderson: For many years, 
you've been an inspiration to others.

00:17:31.074 --> 00:17:34.259
Who or what inspires you and why?

00:17:34.779 --> 00:17:36.491
KS: Good question.

00:17:36.491 --> 00:17:40.485
Chris, let me tell you, 
and that is the truth,

00:17:40.485 --> 00:17:44.999
each time when I free a child,

00:17:44.999 --> 00:17:49.178
the child who has lost all his hope
that he will ever come back to his mother,

00:17:49.178 --> 00:17:53.485
the first smile of freedom,

00:17:53.485 --> 00:17:56.040
and the mother who has lost all hope

00:17:56.040 --> 00:18:02.651
that the son or daughter 
can ever come back and sit in her lap,

00:18:02.651 --> 00:18:04.806
they become so emotional

00:18:04.806 --> 00:18:09.959
and the first tear of joy 
rolls down on her cheek,

00:18:09.959 --> 00:18:13.304
I see the glimpse of God in it --
this is my biggest inspiration.

00:18:13.304 --> 00:18:18.182
And I am so lucky that not once,
as I said before, but thousands of times,

00:18:18.182 --> 00:18:21.778
I have been able to witness my God
in the faces of those children

00:18:21.778 --> 00:18:23.790
and they are my biggest inspirations.

00:18:23.790 --> 00:18:25.802
Thank you.

00:18:25.802 --> 00:18:27.815
(Applause)
