(Music)

00:00:18.005 --> 00:00:22.760
Dannielle Hadley: Life
in Pennsylvania means just that:

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:26.452
life without the possibility of parole.

00:00:26.452 --> 00:00:28.332
For us lifers,

00:00:28.332 --> 00:00:30.561
as we call ourselves,

00:00:30.561 --> 00:00:32.605
our only chance for release

00:00:32.605 --> 00:00:34.834
is through commutation,

00:00:34.834 --> 00:00:39.454
which has only been granted
to two women since 1989,

00:00:39.454 --> 00:00:42.255
close to 30 years ago.

00:00:42.255 --> 00:00:46.109
Our song, "This Is Not Our Home,"

00:00:46.109 --> 00:00:48.037
it tells of our experiences

00:00:48.037 --> 00:00:53.354
while doing life without
the possibility of parole.

00:00:53.354 --> 00:00:57.833
(Music)

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:15.450
Brenda Watkins: I'm a woman.

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.477
I'm a grandmother.

00:01:18.477 --> 00:01:21.356
I'm a daughter.

00:01:21.356 --> 00:01:24.273
I have a son.

00:01:24.273 --> 00:01:26.920
I'm not an angel.

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:30.078
I'm not the devil.

00:01:30.078 --> 00:01:32.861
I came to jail

00:01:32.861 --> 00:01:36.786
when I was so young.

00:01:42.632 --> 00:01:47.442
I spend my time here

00:01:47.442 --> 00:01:53.433
inside these prison walls.

00:01:53.433 --> 00:01:57.001
Lost friends to death,

00:01:57.001 --> 00:02:03.417
saw some go home.

00:02:03.417 --> 00:02:07.240
Watch years pass,

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:11.404
people come and go,

00:02:11.404 --> 00:02:21.642
while I do life without parole.

00:02:25.253 --> 00:02:30.528
I am a prisoner
for the wrong I've done.

00:02:30.528 --> 00:02:33.523
I'm doing time here.

00:02:33.523 --> 00:02:35.404
This is not my home.

00:02:35.404 --> 00:02:40.466
Dream of freedom, hope for mercy.

00:02:40.466 --> 00:02:44.599
Will I see

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:48.337
my family

00:02:48.337 --> 00:02:53.990
or die alone?

00:02:58.878 --> 00:03:02.361
As the years go by,

00:03:02.361 --> 00:03:07.980
I hold back my tears,

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:16.455
because if I cry I'd give in to fear.

00:03:16.455 --> 00:03:24.260
I must be strong, have to hold on.

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:28.179
Gotta get through

00:03:28.179 --> 00:03:32.528
another year.

00:03:32.528 --> 00:03:38.031
I am a prisoner
for the wrong I've done.

00:03:38.031 --> 00:03:41.723
I'm doing time here.
This is not my home.

00:03:41.723 --> 00:03:46.808
Dream of freedom, hope for mercy.

00:03:46.808 --> 00:03:51.278
Will I see

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:54.400
my family

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:59.700
or die alone?

00:04:04.547 --> 00:04:08.819
I'm not saying that I'm not guilty,

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:13.394
I'm not saying that I shouldn't pay.

00:04:13.394 --> 00:04:17.132
All I'm asking is for forgiveness.

00:04:17.132 --> 00:04:24.071
Gotta have hope I'll be free someday.

00:04:28.881 --> 00:04:34.755
Is there a place for me

00:04:34.755 --> 00:04:39.051
in the world out there?

00:04:39.051 --> 00:04:45.950
Will they ever know or care
that I'm chained?

00:04:47.396 --> 00:04:54.513
Is there redemption for the sin
of my younger days?

00:04:54.513 --> 00:04:58.458
Because I've changed.

00:04:58.458 --> 00:05:02.540
Lord knows I've changed.

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:07.746
I am a prisoner
for the wrong I've done.

00:05:07.746 --> 00:05:11.066
I'm doing time here.
This is not my home.

00:05:11.066 --> 00:05:15.780
Dream of freedom, hope for mercy.

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:19.680
Will I see

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:22.722
my family

00:05:22.722 --> 00:05:28.130
or die alone?

00:05:31.754 --> 00:05:35.359
Will I see

00:05:35.359 --> 00:05:38.558
my family

00:05:38.558 --> 00:05:43.292
