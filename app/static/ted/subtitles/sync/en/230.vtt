00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.150
In this rather long sort of marathon presentation,

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:18.150
I've tried to break it up into three parts:

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:23.150
the first being a whole lot of examples on how it can be

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:27.150
a little bit more pleasurable to deal with a computer

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.150
and really address the qualities of the human interface.

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:33.150
And these will be some simple design qualities

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:36.150
and they will also be some qualities of, if you will,

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:38.150
the intelligence of interaction.

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:42.150
Then the second part will really just be examples of new technologies --

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:46.150
new media falling very much into that mold.

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:49.150
Again, I will go through them as fast as possible.

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:52.150
And then the last one will be some examples

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:56.150
I've been able to collect, which I think

00:00:56.150 --> 00:01:02.150
illustrate this at least as best I can, in the world of entertainment.

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:08.150
People have this belief -- and I share most of it --

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:12.150
that we will be using the TV screens or their equivalents

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.150
for electronic books of the future. But then you think,

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:20.150
"My God! What a terrible image you get when you look at still pictures on TV."

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:22.150
Well, it doesn't have to be terrible.

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:26.150
And that is a slide taken from a TV set

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:30.150
and it was pre-processed to be very sympathetic to the TV medium,

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.150
and it absolutely looks beautiful.

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:39.150
Well, what's happened? How did people get into this mess?

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.150
Where you are now, all of a sudden,

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:43.150
sitting in front of personal computers

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:47.150
and video text -- teletext systems,

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:50.150
and somewhat horrified by what you see on the screen?

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:53.150
Well, you have to remember that TV was designed

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:56.150
to be looked at eight times the distance of the diagonal.

00:01:56.150 --> 00:02:01.150
So you get a 13-inch, 19-inch, whatever, TV,

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:03.150
and then you should multiply that by eight

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:06.150
and that's the distance you should sit away from the TV set.

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:11.150
Now we've put people 18 inches in front of a TV,

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:16.150
and all the artifacts that none of the original designers expected to be seen,

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:18.150
all of a sudden, are staring you in the face:

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:21.150
the shadow mask, the scan lines, all of that.

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:23.150
And they can be treated very easily;

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:26.150
there are actually ways of getting rid of them,

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:32.150
there are actually ways of just making absolutely beautiful pictures.

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:35.150
I'm talking here a little bit about display technologies.

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:38.150
Let me talk about how you might input information.

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:42.150
And my favorite example is always fingers.

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:44.150
I'm very interested in touch-sensitive displays.

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:48.150
High-tech, high-touch. Isn't that what some of you said?

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:55.150
It's certainly a very important medium for input,

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:58.150
and a lot of people think that fingers are a very low-resolution

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:02.150
sort of stylus for inputting to a display.

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:06.150
In fact, they're not: it's really a very, very high-resolution input medium --

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:09.150
you have to just do it twice, you have to touch the screen

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:12.150
and then rotate your finger slightly --

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:15.150
and you can move a cursor with great accuracy.

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:17.150
And so when you see on the market these systems

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:22.150
that have just a few light emitting diodes on the side and are very low resolution,

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:26.150
it's nice that they exist because it still is better than nothing.

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:28.150
But it, in some sense, misses the point:

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:34.150
namely, that fingers are a very, very high-resolution input medium.

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:36.150
Now, what are some of the other advantages?

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:40.150
Well, the one advantage is that you don't have to pick them up,

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:44.150
and people don't realize how important that is --

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:47.150
not having to pick up your fingers to use them. (Laughter)

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:54.150
When you think for a second of the mouse on Macintosh --

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:58.150
and I will not criticize the mouse too much --

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:02.150
when you're typing -- what you have -- you want to now put something --

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:04.150
first of all, you've got to find the mouse.

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:09.150
You have to probably stop. Maybe not come to a grinding halt,

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:12.150
but you've got to sort of find that mouse. Then you find the mouse,

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:14.150
and you're going to have to wiggle it a little bit

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:16.150
to see where the cursor is on the screen.

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:18.150
And then when you finally see where it is,

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:20.150
then you've got to move it to get the cursor over there,

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:23.150
and then -- "Bang" -- you've got to hit a button or do whatever.

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:26.150
That's four separate steps versus typing and then touching

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:31.150
and typing and just doing it all in one motion --

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:35.150
or one-and-a-half, depending on how you want to count.

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:37.150
Again, what I'm trying to do is just illustrate

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:41.150
the kinds of problems that I think face the designers

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:44.150
of new computer systems and entertainment systems

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:47.150
and educational systems

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:50.150
from the perspective of the quality of that interface.

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:55.150
And another advantage, of course, of using fingers is you have 10 of them.

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:58.150
And we have never known how to do this technically,

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:00.150
so this slide is a fake slide.

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:03.150
We never succeeded in using ten fingers,

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:06.150
but there are certain things you can do, obviously,

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:11.150
with more than one-finger input, which is rather fascinating.

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:14.150
What we did stumble across was something ...

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:17.150
Again, which is typical of the computer field,

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:22.150
is when you have a bug that you can't get rid of you turn it into a feature.

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:24.150
And maybe ... (Laughter)

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:28.150
maybe a mouse is a new kind of bug.

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:32.150
But the bug in our case was in touch-sensitive displays:

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:36.150
we wanted to be able to draw -- you know, rub your finger

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:39.150
across the screen to input continuous points --

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:41.150
and there was just too much friction

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:43.150
created between your finger and the glass --

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:47.150
if glass was the substrate, which it usually is.

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:50.150
So we found that that actually was a feature

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:53.150
in the sense you could build a pressure-sensitive display.

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:55.150
And when you touch it with your finger,

00:05:55.150 --> 00:06:00.150
you can actually, then, introduce all the forces on the face of that screen,

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:04.150
and that actually has a certain amount of value.

00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:06.150
Let me see if I can load another disc

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:15.150
and show you, quickly, an example.

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:18.150
Now, imagine a screen, which is not only touch-sensitive now,

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:20.150
it's pressure-sensitive.

00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:24.150
And it's pressure-sensitive to the forces both in the plane of the screen --

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:26.150
X, Y, and Z at least in one direction;

00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:30.150
we couldn't figure out how to come in the other direction.

00:06:30.150 --> 00:06:34.150
But let me get rid of the slide,

00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:41.150
and let's see if this comes on.

00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:45.150
OK. So there is the pressure-sensitive display in operation.

00:06:45.150 --> 00:06:50.150
The person's just, if you will, pushing on the screen to make a curve.

00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:52.150
But this is the interesting part.

00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:56.150
I want to stop it for a second

00:06:56.150 --> 00:07:00.150
because the movie is very badly made.

00:07:00.150 --> 00:07:03.150
And the particular display was built about six years ago,

00:07:03.150 --> 00:07:05.150
and when we moved from one room to another room,

00:07:05.150 --> 00:07:09.150
a rather large person sat on it and it got destroyed.

00:07:09.150 --> 00:07:12.150
So all we have is this record. (Laughter)

00:07:12.150 --> 00:07:20.150
But imagine that screen having lots of objects on it

00:07:20.150 --> 00:07:23.150
and the person has touched an object --

00:07:23.150 --> 00:07:28.150
one of N -- like he did there, and then pushed on it.

00:07:28.150 --> 00:07:30.150
Now, imagine a program

00:07:30.150 --> 00:07:34.150
where some of those objects are physically heavy and some are light:

00:07:34.150 --> 00:07:38.150
one is an anvil on a fuzzy rug

00:07:38.150 --> 00:07:42.150
and the other one is a ping-pong ball on a sheet of glass.

00:07:42.150 --> 00:07:46.150
And when you touch it, you have to really push very hard

00:07:46.150 --> 00:07:48.150
to move that anvil across the screen,

00:07:48.150 --> 00:07:51.150
and yet you touch the ping-pong ball very lightly

00:07:51.150 --> 00:07:53.150
and it just scoots across the screen.

00:07:53.150 --> 00:07:58.150
And what you can do -- oops, I didn't mean to do that --

00:07:58.150 --> 00:08:02.150
what you can do is actually feed back to the user

00:08:02.150 --> 00:08:05.150
the feeling of the physical properties.

00:08:05.150 --> 00:08:08.150
So again, they don't have to be weight;

00:08:08.150 --> 00:08:11.150
they could be a general trying to move troops,

00:08:11.150 --> 00:08:15.150
and he's got to move an aircraft carrier versus a little boat.

00:08:15.150 --> 00:08:18.150
In fact, they funded it for that very reason.

00:08:18.150 --> 00:08:22.150
(Laughter)

00:08:22.150 --> 00:08:28.150
The whole notion, then, is one that at the interface

00:08:28.150 --> 00:08:32.150
there are physical properties in that transducer --

00:08:32.150 --> 00:08:34.150
in this case it's pressure and touches --

00:08:34.150 --> 00:08:38.150
that allow you to present things to the user that you could never present before.

00:08:38.150 --> 00:08:43.150
So it's not simply looking at the quality or, if you will, the luxury of that interface,

00:08:43.150 --> 00:08:45.150
but it's actually looking at the idea

00:08:45.150 --> 00:08:48.150
of presenting things that previously couldn't be presented before.

00:08:48.150 --> 00:08:52.150
I want to move on to another example,

00:08:52.150 --> 00:08:58.150
which is one of a different sort, where we're trying to use computer

00:08:58.150 --> 00:09:03.150
and video disc technology now to come up with a new kind of book.

00:09:03.150 --> 00:09:08.150
Here, the idea is that you're going to take this book,

00:09:08.150 --> 00:09:10.150
if you will, and it's going to come alive.

00:09:10.150 --> 00:09:13.150
You're going to sort of breathe life into it.

00:09:13.150 --> 00:09:17.150
We are so used to doing monologues.

00:09:17.150 --> 00:09:21.150
Filmmakers, for example, are the experts in monologue making:

00:09:21.150 --> 00:09:24.150
you make a film and it has a well-formed beginning, middle and end,

00:09:24.150 --> 00:09:27.150
and in some sense the art of it is that.

00:09:27.150 --> 00:09:31.150
And you then say, "There's an opportunity

00:09:31.150 --> 00:09:35.150
for making conversational movies." Well, what does that mean?

00:09:35.150 --> 00:09:41.150
And it sort of nibbles at the core of the whole profession

00:09:41.150 --> 00:09:43.150
and all the assumptions of that medium.

00:09:43.150 --> 00:09:46.150
So, book writing is the same thing.

00:09:46.150 --> 00:09:49.150
What I'll show you very quickly is a new kind of book

00:09:49.150 --> 00:09:53.150
where it is mixed now with ... all sorts of things live in there,

00:09:53.150 --> 00:09:56.150
but you have to keep a few things in mind.

00:09:56.150 --> 00:10:01.150
One is that this book knows about itself.

00:10:01.150 --> 00:10:07.150
Each frame of the movie has information about itself.

00:10:07.150 --> 00:10:12.150
So it knows, or at least there is computer-readable information

00:10:12.150 --> 00:10:16.150
in the medium itself. It's just not a static movie frame.

00:10:16.150 --> 00:10:18.150
That's one thing. The other is that you have to realize

00:10:18.150 --> 00:10:21.150
that it is a random access medium,

00:10:21.150 --> 00:10:24.150
and you can, in fact, branch and expand and elaborate and shrink.

00:10:24.150 --> 00:10:28.150
And here -- again, my favorite example -- is the cookbook,

00:10:28.150 --> 00:10:31.150
the "Larousse Gastronomique."

00:10:31.150 --> 00:10:34.150
And I think I use the example all too often,

00:10:34.150 --> 00:10:39.150
but it's a great one because there is a classic ending in that little

00:10:39.150 --> 00:10:46.150
encyclopedia-style cookbook that tells you how to do something like penguin,

00:10:46.150 --> 00:10:50.150
and you get to the end of the recipe and it says, "Cook until done."

00:10:50.150 --> 00:10:55.150
Now, that would be, if you will, the top green track,

00:10:55.150 --> 00:10:59.150
which doesn't mean too much. But you might have to elaborate for me

00:10:59.150 --> 00:11:01.150
or for somebody who isn't an expert, and say,

00:11:01.150 --> 00:11:03.150
"Cook at 380 degrees for 45 minutes."

00:11:03.150 --> 00:11:06.150
And then for a real beginner, you would go down even further

00:11:06.150 --> 00:11:10.150
and elaborate more -- say, "Open the oven, preheat, wait for the light to go out,

00:11:10.150 --> 00:11:13.150
open the door, don't leave it open too long,

00:11:13.150 --> 00:11:16.150
put the penguin in and shut the door ..." (Laughter) whatever.

00:11:16.150 --> 00:11:19.150
And that's a much more elaborate one than you dribble back.

00:11:19.150 --> 00:11:24.150
That's one kind of use of random access.

00:11:24.150 --> 00:11:32.150
And the other is where you want to explain the same thing in different ways.

00:11:32.150 --> 00:11:36.150
If you're in a classroom situation and somebody asks a question,

00:11:36.150 --> 00:11:39.150
the last thing you do is repeat what you just said.

00:11:39.150 --> 00:11:43.150
You try and think of a different way of saying the same thing,

00:11:43.150 --> 00:11:48.150
or if you know the particular student and that student's cognitive style,

00:11:48.150 --> 00:11:50.150
then you might say it in a way that you think

00:11:50.150 --> 00:11:53.150
would have a good impedance match with that student.

00:11:53.150 --> 00:11:55.150
There are all sorts of techniques you will use --

00:11:55.150 --> 00:11:59.150
and again, this is a different kind of branching.

00:11:59.150 --> 00:12:05.150
So, what I will show you is ... it's a rather boring book,

00:12:05.150 --> 00:12:08.150
but I'm afraid sometimes you have to do boring books

00:12:08.150 --> 00:12:13.150
because your sponsors aren't necessarily interested in fiction

00:12:13.150 --> 00:12:19.150
and entertainment. And this is a book on how to repair a transmission.

00:12:19.150 --> 00:12:22.150
Now, I don't even know what vintage the transmission is,

00:12:22.150 --> 00:12:27.150
but let me just show you very quickly some of it, and we'll move on.

00:12:33.150 --> 00:12:36.150
(Video) Narrator: And continue to get descriptions for each of these chapters.

00:12:36.150 --> 00:12:38.150
Nicholas Negroponte: Now, this is his table of contents.

00:12:38.150 --> 00:12:42.150
Just a picture of the transmission, and as you rub your finger across the transmission

00:12:42.150 --> 00:12:45.150
it highlights the various parts.

00:12:45.150 --> 00:12:47.150
Narrator: When I find a chapter that I want to see,

00:12:47.150 --> 00:12:59.150
I just touch the text and the system will format pages for me to read.

00:12:59.150 --> 00:13:05.150
The words or phrases that are lit up in red are glossary words,

00:13:05.150 --> 00:13:08.150
so I can get a different definition by just touching the word,

00:13:08.150 --> 00:13:22.150
and the definition appears, superimposed over the illustration.

00:13:33.150 --> 00:13:44.150
NN: This is about the oil pan, or the oil filter and all that.

00:13:44.150 --> 00:13:48.150
This is relatively important because it sets the page ...

00:13:48.150 --> 00:13:53.150
Narrator: This is another example of a page with glossary words

00:13:53.150 --> 00:13:57.150
highlighted in red.

00:13:57.150 --> 00:14:00.150
I can get a definition of these words just by touching them,

00:14:00.150 --> 00:14:08.150
and the definition will appear in the illustration corner.

00:14:08.150 --> 00:14:13.150
I can get back to the illustration, but in this case it's not a single frame,

00:14:13.150 --> 00:14:16.150
but it's actually a movie of someone coming into the frame and doing the repair

00:14:16.150 --> 00:14:19.150
that's described in the text.

00:14:19.150 --> 00:14:23.150
The two-headed slider is a speed control that allows me to watch the movie

00:14:23.150 --> 00:14:26.150
at various speeds, in forward or reverse.

00:14:26.150 --> 00:14:31.150
And the movie is displayed as a full frame movie.

00:14:31.150 --> 00:14:49.150
I can go back to the beginning ... and play the movie at full speed.

00:14:49.150 --> 00:14:51.150
Here's another step-by-step procedure, only in this case --

00:14:51.150 --> 00:14:55.150
NN: Okay, this movie is ... Everybody's heard of sound-sync movies --

00:14:55.150 --> 00:15:00.150
this is text-sync movies, so as the movie plays, the text gets highlighted.

00:15:00.150 --> 00:15:04.150
We highlight the text as we go through the movie.

00:15:04.150 --> 00:15:08.150
Repairman: ... Not too far out. Front poles, preferably.

00:15:08.150 --> 00:15:13.150
Don't loosen them too far. If you loosen them too far, you'll have a big mess.

00:15:14.150 --> 00:15:18.150
NN: I suspect that some of you might not even understand that language.

00:15:18.150 --> 00:15:23.150
(Laughter)

00:15:23.150 --> 00:15:28.150
OK. I'm at the third and last part of this,

00:15:28.150 --> 00:15:32.150
which I said I would make an attempt to at least give you some examples

00:15:32.150 --> 00:15:36.150
that may be more directly related to the world of entertainment.

00:15:36.150 --> 00:15:41.150
And of course, good education has got to be good entertainment,

00:15:41.150 --> 00:15:48.150
so my first example will be drawn from a very recent experiment

00:15:48.150 --> 00:15:51.150
that we've been doing -- in this case, in Senegal --

00:15:51.150 --> 00:15:56.150
where we have tried to use personal computers

00:15:56.150 --> 00:16:01.150
as a pedagogical medium. But not as teaching machines at all;

00:16:01.150 --> 00:16:05.150
the whole notion is to use this as an instrument

00:16:05.150 --> 00:16:08.150
where there is a complete reversal of roles --

00:16:08.150 --> 00:16:12.150
the child is, if you will, the teacher and the machine is the student --

00:16:12.150 --> 00:16:14.150
and the art of computer programming is a vehicle that sort of

00:16:14.150 --> 00:16:17.150
approximates thinking about thinking.

00:16:17.150 --> 00:16:22.150
But teaching kids programming per se is utterly irrelevant.

00:16:22.150 --> 00:16:25.150
And there are just a few slides I want to go through,

00:16:25.150 --> 00:16:31.150
but there's a story I'd like to tell. And that was when,

00:16:31.150 --> 00:16:33.150
before we did this in any developing countries --

00:16:33.150 --> 00:16:35.150
we're doing it, in fact, in three developing countries right now:

00:16:35.150 --> 00:16:37.150
Pakistan, Colombia and Senegal --

00:16:37.150 --> 00:16:42.150
we did it in some pretty rough areas of New York City.

00:16:42.150 --> 00:16:47.150
And one child, whose name I've forgotten, was about seven or eight years old,

00:16:47.150 --> 00:16:52.150
absolutely considered mentally handicapped --

00:16:52.150 --> 00:17:00.150
couldn't read, didn't even make it in the lowest section of the school's classes --

00:17:00.150 --> 00:17:03.150
and was pretty much not in school, though physically there.

00:17:03.150 --> 00:17:06.150
But did hang around the, quote, "computer room,"

00:17:06.150 --> 00:17:08.150
where there were quite a few computers,

00:17:08.150 --> 00:17:12.150
and learned this particular language called Logo --

00:17:12.150 --> 00:17:15.150
and learned it with great ease and found it a lot of fun,

00:17:15.150 --> 00:17:20.150
it was very interesting. And one day, by chance,

00:17:20.150 --> 00:17:26.150
some visitors from the NIE came by in their double-breasted suits

00:17:26.150 --> 00:17:31.150
looking at this setup, and none of the children who were normally there,

00:17:31.150 --> 00:17:35.150
except for this one child, were there.

00:17:35.150 --> 00:17:38.150
He was, and he said, "Let me show you how this works,"

00:17:38.150 --> 00:17:43.150
and they got an absolutely ingenuous, wonderful description of Logo.

00:17:43.150 --> 00:17:47.150
And the child was just zipping right through it, showing them all sorts of things

00:17:47.150 --> 00:17:51.150
until they asked him how to do something which he couldn't explain

00:17:51.150 --> 00:17:54.150
and so he flipped through the manual, found the explanation

00:17:54.150 --> 00:17:56.150
and typed the command and got it to do what they asked.

00:17:56.150 --> 00:18:00.150
They were delighted, and by the time it was time to go see the principal,

00:18:00.150 --> 00:18:03.150
whom they'd actually come to see -- not the computer room --

00:18:03.150 --> 00:18:04.150
they went upstairs and they said,

00:18:04.150 --> 00:18:06.150
"This is absolutely remarkable!

00:18:06.150 --> 00:18:10.150
That child was very articulate and showed us

00:18:10.150 --> 00:18:14.150
and even dealt with the things he couldn't do automatically

00:18:14.150 --> 00:18:18.150
with that manual. It was just absolutely fantastic."

00:18:18.150 --> 00:18:21.150
The principal said, "There's a dreadful mistake,

00:18:21.150 --> 00:18:23.150
because that child can't read.

00:18:23.150 --> 00:18:25.150
And you obviously have been hoodwinked

00:18:25.150 --> 00:18:28.150
or you've talked about somebody else."

00:18:28.150 --> 00:18:30.150
And they all got up and they all went downstairs

00:18:30.150 --> 00:18:34.150
and the child was still there. And they did something very intelligent:

00:18:34.150 --> 00:18:38.150
they asked the child, "Can you read?"

00:18:38.150 --> 00:18:41.150
And the child said, "No, I can't."

00:18:41.150 --> 00:18:43.150
And then they said, "But wait a minute. You

00:18:43.150 --> 00:18:46.150
just looked through that manual and you found ... "

00:18:46.150 --> 00:18:49.150
and he said, "Oh, but that's not reading."

00:18:49.150 --> 00:18:51.150
And so they said, "Well, what's reading then?"

00:18:51.150 --> 00:18:55.150
He says, "Well, reading is this junk they give me in little books to read.

00:18:55.150 --> 00:19:02.150
It's absolutely irrelevant, (Laughter) and I get nothing for it.

00:19:02.150 --> 00:19:06.150
But here, with a little bit of effort I get a lot of return."

00:19:06.150 --> 00:19:08.150
And it really meant something to the child.

00:19:08.150 --> 00:19:10.150
The child read beautifully, it turned out,

00:19:10.150 --> 00:19:14.150
and was really very competent. So it actually meant something.

00:19:14.150 --> 00:19:19.150
And that story has many other anecdotes that are similar,

00:19:19.150 --> 00:19:26.150
but wow. The key to the future of computers in education is right there,

00:19:26.150 --> 00:19:29.150
and it is: when does it mean something to a child?

00:19:29.150 --> 00:19:32.150
There is a myth, and it truly is a myth:

00:19:32.150 --> 00:19:35.150
we believe -- and I'm sure a lot of you believe in this room --

00:19:35.150 --> 00:19:40.150
that it is harder to read and write than it is to learn how to speak.

00:19:40.150 --> 00:19:46.150
And it's not, but we think speech -- "My God, little children pick it up somehow,

00:19:46.150 --> 00:19:48.150
and by the age of two they're doing a mediocre job,

00:19:48.150 --> 00:19:51.150
and by three and four they're speaking reasonably well.

00:19:51.150 --> 00:19:53.150
And yet you've got to go to school to learn how to read,

00:19:53.150 --> 00:19:56.150
and you have to sit in a classroom and somebody has to teach you.

00:19:56.150 --> 00:19:59.150
Hence, it must be harder." Well, it's not harder.

00:19:59.150 --> 00:20:06.150
What the truth is is that speaking has great value to a child;

00:20:06.150 --> 00:20:09.150
the child can get a great deal by talking to you.

00:20:09.150 --> 00:20:11.150
Reading and writing is utterly useless.

00:20:11.150 --> 00:20:16.150
There is no reason for a child to read and write except blind faith,

00:20:16.150 --> 00:20:19.150
and that it's going to help you. (Laughter)

00:20:19.150 --> 00:20:22.150
So what happens is you go to school and people say,

00:20:22.150 --> 00:20:25.150
"Just believe me, you're going to like it.

00:20:25.150 --> 00:20:28.150
You're going to like reading," and just read and read.

00:20:28.150 --> 00:20:32.150
On the other hand, you give a kid -- a three-year-old kid -- a computer

00:20:32.150 --> 00:20:35.150
and they type a little command and -- Poof! -- something happens.

00:20:35.150 --> 00:20:38.150
And all of a sudden ... You may not call that reading and writing,

00:20:38.150 --> 00:20:41.150
but a certain bit of typing and reading stuff on the screen

00:20:41.150 --> 00:20:44.150
has a huge payoff, and it's a lot of fun.

00:20:44.150 --> 00:20:48.150
And in fact, it's a powerful educational instrument.

00:20:48.150 --> 00:20:53.150
Well, in Senegal we found that this was the traditional classroom:

00:20:53.150 --> 00:20:58.150
120 kids -- three per desk -- one teacher, a little bit of chalk.

00:20:58.150 --> 00:21:01.150
This student was one of our first students,

00:21:01.150 --> 00:21:05.150
and it's the girl on the left leaning with her chalkboard,

00:21:05.150 --> 00:21:08.150
and she came ... within two days --

00:21:08.150 --> 00:21:10.150
I want to show you the program she wrote,

00:21:10.150 --> 00:21:16.150
and remember her hairstyle. And that is the program she made.

00:21:16.150 --> 00:21:20.150
That's what meant something to her, is doing the hair pattern,

00:21:20.150 --> 00:21:25.150
and actually did it within two days -- an hour each day --

00:21:25.150 --> 00:21:27.150
and found it was, to her,

00:21:27.150 --> 00:21:30.150
absolutely the most meaningful piece ...

00:21:30.150 --> 00:21:34.150
But rooted in that, little did she know how much knowledge

00:21:34.150 --> 00:21:36.150
she was acquiring about geometry

00:21:36.150 --> 00:21:39.150
and just math and logic and all the rest.

00:21:39.150 --> 00:21:42.150
And again, I could talk for three hours about this subject.

00:21:42.150 --> 00:21:50.150
I will come to my last example and then quit.

00:21:50.150 --> 00:21:56.150
And my last example -- as some of my former colleagues,

00:21:56.150 --> 00:21:59.150
whom I see in the room, can imagine what it will be.

00:21:59.150 --> 00:22:02.150
Yes, it is. It's our work -- that was a while ago,

00:22:02.150 --> 00:22:06.150
and it still is my favorite project -- of teleconferencing.

00:22:06.150 --> 00:22:08.150
And the reason it remains a favorite project

00:22:08.150 --> 00:22:15.150
is that we were asked to do a teleconferencing system

00:22:15.150 --> 00:22:17.150
where you had the following situation:

00:22:17.150 --> 00:22:22.150
you had five people at five different sites -- they were known people --

00:22:22.150 --> 00:22:27.150
and you had to have these people in teleconference,

00:22:27.150 --> 00:22:30.150
such that each one was utterly convinced

00:22:30.150 --> 00:22:34.150
that the other four were physically present.

00:22:34.150 --> 00:22:38.150
Now, that is sufficiently

00:22:38.150 --> 00:22:43.150
zany that we would, obviously, jump to the bait, and we did.

00:22:43.150 --> 00:22:46.150
And the fact that we knew the people --

00:22:46.150 --> 00:22:49.150
we had to take a page out of the history of Walt Disney --

00:22:49.150 --> 00:22:52.150
we actually went so far as to build CRTs

00:22:52.150 --> 00:22:55.150
in the shapes of the people's faces.

00:22:55.150 --> 00:23:00.150
So if I wanted to call my friend Peter Sprague on the phone,

00:23:00.150 --> 00:23:03.150
my secretary would get his head out and bring it and set it on the desk,

00:23:03.150 --> 00:23:04.150
(Laughter)

00:23:04.150 --> 00:23:09.150
and that would be the TV used for the occasion.

00:23:09.150 --> 00:23:12.150
And it's uncanny: there's no way I can explain to you

00:23:12.150 --> 00:23:16.150
the amount of eye contact you get with that physical face

00:23:16.150 --> 00:23:20.150
projected on a 3D CRT of that sort.

00:23:20.150 --> 00:23:23.150
The next thing that we had to do is to persuade them

00:23:23.150 --> 00:23:27.150
that there needed to be spatial correspondence, which is straightforward,

00:23:27.150 --> 00:23:29.150
but again, it's something that didn't fall naturally

00:23:29.150 --> 00:23:32.150
out of a telecommunications or computing style of thinking;

00:23:32.150 --> 00:23:36.150
it was a very, if you will, architectural or spatial concept.

00:23:36.150 --> 00:23:39.150
And that was to recognize that when you sit around the table,

00:23:39.150 --> 00:23:44.150
the actual location of the people becomes rather important.

00:23:44.150 --> 00:23:47.150
And when somebody gets up, in fact, to go answer a phone

00:23:47.150 --> 00:23:50.150
or use a bathroom or something, the empty seat becomes,

00:23:50.150 --> 00:23:53.150
if you will, that person. And you point frequently to the empty seat

00:23:53.150 --> 00:23:56.150
and you say, "He or she wouldn't agree,"

00:23:56.150 --> 00:24:02.150
and the empty chair is that person and the spatiality is crucial.

00:24:02.150 --> 00:24:05.150
So we said, "Well, these will be on round tables

00:24:05.150 --> 00:24:08.150
and the order around the table had to be the same,

00:24:08.150 --> 00:24:11.150
so that at my site, I would be, if you will, real

00:24:11.150 --> 00:24:16.150
and then at each other's site you'd have these plastic heads.

00:24:16.150 --> 00:24:20.150
And the plastic heads, sometimes you want to project them.

00:24:20.150 --> 00:24:23.150
And there are a number of schemes, which I don't want to dwell on,

00:24:23.150 --> 00:24:25.150
but this is the one that we finally used

00:24:25.150 --> 00:24:29.150
where we projected onto rear screen material

00:24:29.150 --> 00:24:33.150
that was molded in the face -- literally in the face of the person.

00:24:33.150 --> 00:24:37.150
And I'll show you one more slide, where this is actually made

00:24:37.150 --> 00:24:41.150
from something called a solid photograph and is the screen.

00:24:41.150 --> 00:24:44.150
Now, we track, on the person's head, the head motions --

00:24:44.150 --> 00:24:48.150
so we transmit with a video the head positions --

00:24:48.150 --> 00:24:55.150
and so this head moves in about two axes.

00:24:55.150 --> 00:25:00.150
So if I, all of a sudden, turn to the person to my left

00:25:00.150 --> 00:25:05.150
and start talking to that person, then at the person to my right's site,

00:25:05.150 --> 00:25:08.150
he'll see these two plastic heads talking to each other.

00:25:08.150 --> 00:25:13.150
And then if that person interrupts, then those two heads may turn.

00:25:13.150 --> 00:25:18.150
And it really is reconstructing, quite accurately, teleconferencing.
