WEBVTT

00:00:13.808 --> 00:00:19.754
Imagine a place where your neighbors
greet your children by name;

00:00:19.778 --> 00:00:23.081
a place with splendid vistas;

00:00:23.105 --> 00:00:26.216
a place where you can drive
just 20 minutes

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:28.302
and put your sailboat on the water.

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.409
It's a seductive place, isn't it?

00:00:32.411 --> 00:00:34.007
I don't live there.

00:00:34.031 --> 00:00:36.580
(Laughter)

00:00:36.604 --> 00:00:42.623
But I did journey on a 27,000-mile trip

00:00:42.647 --> 00:00:49.009
for two years, to the fastest-growing
and whitest counties in America.

00:00:50.882 --> 00:00:52.351
What is a Whitopia?

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:56.125
I define Whitopia in three ways:

00:00:56.149 --> 00:01:02.808
First, a Whitopia has posted at least
six percent population growth since 2000.

00:01:03.601 --> 00:01:08.074
Secondly, the majority of that growth
comes from white migrants.

00:01:08.565 --> 00:01:12.365
And third, the Whitopia
has an ineffable charm,

00:01:12.389 --> 00:01:14.944
a pleasant look and feel,

00:01:14.968 --> 00:01:16.476
a je Ne sais quoi.

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.709
(Laughter)

00:01:19.733 --> 00:01:24.125
To learn how and why
Whitopias are ticking,

00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:29.572
I immersed myself for several months
apiece in three of them:

00:01:29.596 --> 00:01:32.246
first, St. George, Utah;

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:34.707
second, Coeur d'Alene, Idaho;

00:01:34.731 --> 00:01:37.334
and third, Forsyth County, Georgia.

00:01:39.033 --> 00:01:44.559
First stop, St. George --
a beautiful town of red rock landscapes.

00:01:44.583 --> 00:01:49.936
In the 1850s, Brigham Young
dispatched families to St. George

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:53.244
to grow cotton because
of the hot, arid climate.

00:01:53.268 --> 00:01:57.696
And so they called it Utah's Dixie,
and the name sticks to this day.

00:02:00.518 --> 00:02:05.480
I approached my time in each Whitopia
like an anthropologist.

00:02:05.504 --> 00:02:10.125
I made detailed spreadsheets of all
the power brokers in the communities,

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:13.583
who I needed to meet,
where I needed to be,

00:02:13.607 --> 00:02:16.825
and I threw myself with gusto
in these communities.

00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:19.125
I went to zoning board meetings,

00:02:19.149 --> 00:02:22.912
I went to Democratic clubs
and Republican clubs.

00:02:22.936 --> 00:02:24.848
I went to poker nights.

00:02:27.356 --> 00:02:32.268
In St. George, I rented
a home at the Entrada,

00:02:32.292 --> 00:02:35.404
one of the town's
premier gated communities.

00:02:35.428 --> 00:02:39.746
There were no Motel 6's
or Howard Johnsons for me.

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:44.104
I lived in Whitopia as a resident,
and not like a visitor.

00:02:45.033 --> 00:02:49.535
I rented myself this home by phone.

00:02:49.559 --> 00:02:52.098
(Laughter)

00:02:52.122 --> 00:02:53.487
(Applause)

00:02:53.511 --> 00:02:59.471
Golf is the perfect seductive
symbol of Whitopia.

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:01.710
When I went on my journey,

00:03:01.734 --> 00:03:04.849
I had barely ever held a golf club.

00:03:04.873 --> 00:03:09.548
By the time I left, I was golfing
at least three times a week.

00:03:09.572 --> 00:03:12.259
(Laughter)

00:03:12.283 --> 00:03:15.219
Golf helps people bond.

00:03:15.243 --> 00:03:21.486
Some of the best interviews I ever scored
during my trip were on the golf courses.

00:03:21.866 --> 00:03:27.325
One venture capitalist, for example,
invited me to golf in his private club

00:03:27.349 --> 00:03:29.404
that had no minority members.

00:03:31.083 --> 00:03:32.558
I also went fishing.

00:03:32.582 --> 00:03:34.583
(Laughter)

00:03:34.607 --> 00:03:37.623
Because I had never fished,
this fellow had to teach me

00:03:37.647 --> 00:03:40.423
how to cast my line and what bait to use.

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:45.971
I also played poker every weekend.

00:03:45.995 --> 00:03:48.827
It was Texas Hold 'em with a $10 buy-in.

00:03:50.208 --> 00:03:54.467
My poker mates may have been bluffing
about the hands that they drew,

00:03:54.491 --> 00:03:57.673
but they weren't bluffing
about their social beliefs.

00:03:57.697 --> 00:04:01.300
Some of the most raw,
salty conversations I ever had

00:04:01.324 --> 00:04:04.029
during my journey were at the poker table.

00:04:05.101 --> 00:04:07.107
I'm a gung ho entertainer.

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:12.266
I love to cook, I hosted
many dinner parties, and in return,

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:15.438
people invited me to their dinner parties,

00:04:15.462 --> 00:04:18.120
and to their barbecues,
and to their pool parties,

00:04:18.144 --> 00:04:19.939
and to their birthday parties.

00:04:21.535 --> 00:04:23.002
But it wasn't all fun.

00:04:23.931 --> 00:04:28.293
Immigration turned out to be
a big issue in this Whitopia.

00:04:28.317 --> 00:04:31.731
The St. George's Citizens Council
on Illegal Immigration

00:04:31.755 --> 00:04:35.849
held regular and active protests
against immigration,

00:04:35.873 --> 00:04:41.774
and so what I gleaned from this Whitopia
is what a hot debate this would become.

00:04:41.798 --> 00:04:45.783
It was a real-time preview,
and so it has become.

00:04:47.234 --> 00:04:52.577
Next stop: Almost Heaven,
a cabin I rented for myself

00:04:52.601 --> 00:04:56.268
in Coeur d'Alene, in the beautiful
North Idaho panhandle.

00:04:57.198 --> 00:05:00.221
I rented this place
for myself, also by phone.

00:05:00.245 --> 00:05:01.625
(Laughter)

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:07.500
The book "A Thousand Places To See
Before You Die" lists Coeur d'Alene --

00:05:07.524 --> 00:05:11.618
it's a gorgeous paradise for huntsmen,
boatmen and fishermen.

00:05:13.181 --> 00:05:16.214
My growing golf skills
came in handy in Coeur d'Alene.

00:05:16.238 --> 00:05:19.182
I golfed with retired LAPD cops.

00:05:19.864 --> 00:05:25.374
In 1993, around 11,000 families and cops

00:05:25.398 --> 00:05:31.508
fled Los Angeles
after the L.A. racial unrest,

00:05:31.532 --> 00:05:35.554
for North Idaho, and they've built
an expatriated community.

00:05:36.959 --> 00:05:39.972
Given the conservatism of these cops,

00:05:39.996 --> 00:05:45.338
there's no surprise that North Idaho
has a strong gun culture.

00:05:45.362 --> 00:05:51.144
In fact, it is said, North Idaho
has more gun dealers than gas stations.

00:05:53.827 --> 00:05:56.963
So what's a resident to do to fit in?

00:05:56.987 --> 00:05:58.353
I hit the gun club.

00:05:59.092 --> 00:06:02.487
When I rented a gun,
the gentleman behind the counter

00:06:02.511 --> 00:06:05.125
was perfectly pleasant and kind,

00:06:05.149 --> 00:06:08.090
until I showed him
my New York City driver's license.

00:06:09.149 --> 00:06:10.647
That's when he got nervous.

00:06:11.917 --> 00:06:15.186
I'm not as bad a shot
as I thought I might have been.

00:06:16.598 --> 00:06:23.054
What I learned from North Idaho
is the peculiar brand of paranoia

00:06:23.078 --> 00:06:28.193
that can permeate a community
when so many cops and guns are around.

00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:34.927
In North Idaho, in my red pickup truck,

00:06:34.951 --> 00:06:36.308
I kept a notepad.

00:06:36.850 --> 00:06:41.088
And in that notepad I counted
more Confederate flags than black people.

00:06:41.739 --> 00:06:45.002
In North Idaho, I found Confederate flags

00:06:45.026 --> 00:06:49.251
on key chains, on cellphone paraphernalia,

00:06:49.275 --> 00:06:50.572
and on cars.

00:06:51.930 --> 00:06:55.375
About a seven-minute drive
from my hidden lake cabin

00:06:55.399 --> 00:06:58.216
was the compound of Aryan Nations,

00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:00.232
the white supremacist group.

00:07:02.534 --> 00:07:07.606
America's Promise Ministries,
the religious arm of Aryan Nations,

00:07:07.630 --> 00:07:12.118
happened to have a three-day
retreat during my visit.

00:07:13.063 --> 00:07:14.698
So I decided to crash it.

00:07:14.722 --> 00:07:17.334
(Laughter)

00:07:17.358 --> 00:07:22.193
I'm the only non-Aryan journalist
I'm aware of ever to have done so.

00:07:22.217 --> 00:07:23.279
(Laughter)

00:07:23.303 --> 00:07:27.916
Among the many memorable
episodes of that retreat...

00:07:27.940 --> 00:07:29.209
(Laughter)

00:07:29.233 --> 00:07:33.125
...is when Abe, an Aryan,
sidled up next to me.

00:07:33.149 --> 00:07:38.569
He slapped my knee, and he said, "Hey
Rich, I just want you to know one thing.

00:07:38.593 --> 00:07:43.093
We are not white supremacists.
We are white separatists.

00:07:43.117 --> 00:07:44.991
We don't think we're better than you,

00:07:45.015 --> 00:07:46.704
we just want to be away from you."

00:07:46.728 --> 00:07:51.142
(Laughter)

00:07:51.166 --> 00:07:58.161
Indeed, most white people in Whitopia
are neither white supremacists

00:07:58.185 --> 00:08:00.000
or white separatists;

00:08:00.024 --> 00:08:03.949
in fact, they're not there
for explicitly racial reasons at all.

00:08:04.290 --> 00:08:07.346
Rather, they emigrate there

00:08:07.370 --> 00:08:11.078
for friendliness, comfort,
security, safety --

00:08:11.102 --> 00:08:16.095
reasons that they implicitly associate
to whiteness in itself.

00:08:17.214 --> 00:08:19.088
Next stop was Georgia.

00:08:20.374 --> 00:08:24.486
In Georgia, I stayed in an exurb
north of Atlanta.

00:08:25.177 --> 00:08:26.972
In Utah, I found poker;

00:08:26.996 --> 00:08:28.687
in Idaho, I found guns;

00:08:28.711 --> 00:08:30.265
in Georgia, I found God.

00:08:30.289 --> 00:08:31.528
(Laughter)

00:08:31.552 --> 00:08:35.125
The way that I immersed myself
in this Whitopia

00:08:35.149 --> 00:08:38.540
was to become active
at First Redeemer Church,

00:08:38.564 --> 00:08:42.068
a megachurch that's so huge
that it has golf carts

00:08:42.092 --> 00:08:47.257
to escort the congregants around
its many parking lots on campus.

00:08:47.908 --> 00:08:50.617
I was active in the youth ministry.

00:08:50.641 --> 00:08:55.573
And for me, personally,
I was more comfortable in this Whitopia

00:08:55.597 --> 00:09:00.230
than say, in a Colorado, or an Idaho,
or even a suburban Boston.

00:09:01.149 --> 00:09:04.239
That is because [there], in Georgia,

00:09:04.263 --> 00:09:08.782
white people and black people are more
historically familiar to one another.

00:09:09.242 --> 00:09:12.038
I was less exotic in this Whitopia.

00:09:12.062 --> 00:09:14.062
(Laughter)

00:09:14.834 --> 00:09:16.421
But what does it all mean?

00:09:17.192 --> 00:09:22.573
Whitopian dreaming, Whitopia migration,
is a push-pull phenomenon,

00:09:22.597 --> 00:09:26.738
full of alarming pushes
and alluring pulls,

00:09:26.762 --> 00:09:33.375
and Whitopia operates at the level
of conscious and unconscious bias.

00:09:34.010 --> 00:09:39.413
It's possible for people to be in Whitopia
not for racist reasons,

00:09:39.437 --> 00:09:41.727
though it has racist outcomes.

00:09:43.854 --> 00:09:47.698
Many Whitopians feel pushed by illegals,

00:09:47.722 --> 00:09:53.239
social welfare abuse, minorities,
density, crowded schools.

00:09:53.263 --> 00:09:58.442
Many Whitopians feel pulled by merit,

00:09:58.466 --> 00:10:04.230
freedom, the allure of privatism --
privatized places, privatized people,

00:10:04.254 --> 00:10:05.571
privatized things.

00:10:07.674 --> 00:10:13.262
And I learned in Whitopia
how a country can have racism

00:10:13.286 --> 00:10:14.621
without racists.

00:10:15.391 --> 00:10:18.178
Many of my smug urban liberal friends

00:10:18.202 --> 00:10:20.939
couldn't believe I would go
on such a venture.

00:10:21.597 --> 00:10:27.119
The reality is that many white Americans
are affable and kind.

00:10:27.793 --> 00:10:32.562
Interpersonal race relations --
how we treat each other as human beings --

00:10:32.586 --> 00:10:36.193
are vastly better than in
my parents' generation.

00:10:37.312 --> 00:10:40.935
Can you imagine me going
to Whitopia 40 years ago?

00:10:41.746 --> 00:10:43.634
What a journey that would have been.

00:10:43.658 --> 00:10:45.416
(Laughter)

00:10:45.440 --> 00:10:47.309
And yet, some things haven't changed.

00:10:47.722 --> 00:10:54.433
America is as residentially
and educationally segregated today

00:10:54.457 --> 00:10:57.024
as it was in 1970.

00:10:59.673 --> 00:11:04.304
As Americans, we often find ways
to cook for each other,

00:11:04.328 --> 00:11:05.948
to dance with each other,

00:11:05.972 --> 00:11:07.845
to host with each other,

00:11:07.869 --> 00:11:12.917
but why can't that translate into how we
treat each other as communities?

00:11:13.385 --> 00:11:15.505
It's a devastating irony,

00:11:15.529 --> 00:11:18.841
how we have gone forward as individuals,

00:11:18.865 --> 00:11:21.475
and backwards as communities.

00:11:23.916 --> 00:11:28.209
One of the Whitopian outlooks
that really hit me

00:11:28.233 --> 00:11:30.405
was a proverbial saying:

00:11:30.429 --> 00:11:33.905
"One black man is
a delightful dinner guest;

00:11:33.929 --> 00:11:35.971
50 black men is a ghetto."

00:11:41.029 --> 00:11:47.905
One of the big contexts animating
my Whitopian journey was the year 2042.

00:11:48.818 --> 00:11:54.926
By 2042, white people will no longer be
the American majority.

00:11:55.600 --> 00:11:58.901
As such, will there be more Whitopias?

00:12:01.076 --> 00:12:02.763
In looking at this,

00:12:02.787 --> 00:12:09.494
the danger of Whitopia is
that the more segregation we have,

00:12:09.518 --> 00:12:15.319
the less we can look at and confront
conscious and unconscious bias.

00:12:18.454 --> 00:12:22.815
I ventured on my two-year,
27,000 mile journey

00:12:22.839 --> 00:12:27.926
to learn where, why, and how
white people are fleeing,

00:12:27.950 --> 00:12:30.692
but I didn't expect to have
so much fun on my journey.

00:12:30.716 --> 00:12:31.723
(Laughter)

00:12:31.747 --> 00:12:34.637
I didn't expect to learn
so much about myself.

00:12:35.558 --> 00:12:39.006
I don't expect I'll be living
in a Whitopia --

00:12:39.030 --> 00:12:41.141
or a Blacktopia, for that matter.

00:12:41.942 --> 00:12:45.351
I do plan to continue golfing
every chance I get.

00:12:45.375 --> 00:12:46.937
(Laughter)

00:12:46.961 --> 00:12:51.586
And I'll just have to leave the guns
and megachurches back in Whitopia.

00:12:52.864 --> 00:12:54.016
Thank you.

00:12:54.040 --> 00:13:00.126
(Applause)
