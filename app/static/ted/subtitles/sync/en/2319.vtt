WEBVTT

00:00:12.832 --> 00:00:14.920
I was raised by lesbians in the mountains,

00:00:14.944 --> 00:00:18.518
and I sort of came like a forest gnome
to New York City a while back.

00:00:18.542 --> 00:00:19.676
(Laughter)

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:24.484
Really messed with my head,
but I'll get into that later.

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:27.545
I'll start with when
I was eight years old.

00:00:27.889 --> 00:00:29.805
I took a wood box,

00:00:29.829 --> 00:00:34.924
and I buried a dollar bill, a pen
and a fork inside this box in Colorado.

00:00:35.281 --> 00:00:40.865
And I thought some strange humanoids
or aliens in 500 years would find this box

00:00:40.889 --> 00:00:45.415
and learn about the way
our species exchanged ideas,

00:00:45.439 --> 00:00:47.473
maybe how we ate our spaghetti.

00:00:47.497 --> 00:00:48.829
I really didn't know.

00:00:49.551 --> 00:00:50.988
Anyway, this is kind of funny,

00:00:51.012 --> 00:00:55.359
because here I am, 30 years later,
and I'm still making boxes.

00:00:56.439 --> 00:00:59.422
Now, at some point I was in Hawaii --

00:00:59.446 --> 00:01:01.948
I like to hike and surf
and do all that weird stuff,

00:01:01.972 --> 00:01:04.064
and I was making a collage for my ma.

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.588
And I took a dictionary
and I ripped it up,

00:01:06.612 --> 00:01:09.347
and I made it into a sort
of Agnes Martin grid,

00:01:09.371 --> 00:01:11.942
and I poured resin all over it
and a bee got stuck.

00:01:11.966 --> 00:01:14.684
Now, she's afraid of bees
and she's allergic to them,

00:01:14.708 --> 00:01:18.943
so I poured more resin on the canvas,
thinking I could hide it or something.

00:01:18.967 --> 00:01:20.507
Instead, the opposite happened:

00:01:20.531 --> 00:01:22.213
It sort of created a magnification,

00:01:22.237 --> 00:01:24.625
like a magnifying glass,
on the dictionary text.

00:01:25.428 --> 00:01:27.650
So what did I do? I built more boxes.

00:01:28.108 --> 00:01:32.012
This time, I started putting
electronics, frogs,

00:01:32.036 --> 00:01:35.583
strange bottles I'd find in the street --
anything I could find --

00:01:35.607 --> 00:01:37.956
because I was always
finding things my whole life,

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:41.618
and trying to make relationships
and tell stories between these objects.

00:01:42.046 --> 00:01:44.427
So I started drawing around the objects,

00:01:44.451 --> 00:01:47.763
and I realized: Holy moly,
I can draw in space!

00:01:47.787 --> 00:01:49.786
I can make free-floating lines,

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:52.833
like the way you would draw
around a dead body at a crime scene.

00:01:52.857 --> 00:01:54.133
So I took the objects out,

00:01:54.157 --> 00:01:57.122
and I created my own taxonomy
of invented specimens.

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:00.924
First, botanical --
which you can kind of get a sense of.

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:04.810
Then I made some
weird insects and creatures.

00:02:06.142 --> 00:02:09.016
It was really fun; I was just
drawing on the layers of resin.

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:12.498
And it was cool, because I was actually
starting to have shows and stuff,

00:02:12.522 --> 00:02:15.494
I was making some money,
I could take my girlfriend for dinner,

00:02:15.518 --> 00:02:16.773
and like, go to Sizzler.

00:02:16.797 --> 00:02:18.202
It was some good shit, man.

00:02:18.226 --> 00:02:19.854
(Laughter)

00:02:19.878 --> 00:02:23.784
At some point, I got up to the human form,

00:02:23.808 --> 00:02:28.435
life-size resin sculptures
with drawings of humans inside the layers.

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:30.918
This was great, except for one thing:

00:02:30.942 --> 00:02:32.192
I was going to die.

00:02:32.686 --> 00:02:35.749
I didn't know what to do,
because the resin was going to kill me.

00:02:35.773 --> 00:02:38.086
And I went to bed every night
thinking about it.

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:40.602
So I tried using glass.

00:02:40.626 --> 00:02:42.615
I started drawing on the layers of glass,

00:02:42.639 --> 00:02:45.711
almost like if you drew on a window,
then you put another window,

00:02:45.735 --> 00:02:48.478
and another window, and you had
all these windows together

00:02:48.502 --> 00:02:50.637
that made a three-dimensional composition.

00:02:50.661 --> 00:02:53.594
And this really worked,
because I could stop using the resin.

00:02:54.087 --> 00:02:55.468
So I did this for years,

00:02:55.492 --> 00:02:59.927
which culminated in a very large work,
which I call "The Triptych."

00:03:00.277 --> 00:03:02.198
"The Triptych" was largely inspired

00:03:02.222 --> 00:03:05.159
by Hieronymus Bosch's
"[The] Garden of Earthly Delights,"

00:03:05.183 --> 00:03:07.807
which is a painting
in the [Museo del] Prado in Spain.

00:03:07.831 --> 00:03:09.530
Do you guys know this painting?

00:03:09.554 --> 00:03:10.847
Good, it's a cool painting.

00:03:10.871 --> 00:03:12.845
It's kind of ahead of its time, they say.

00:03:12.869 --> 00:03:15.360
So, "The Triptych."
I'll walk you through this piece.

00:03:15.384 --> 00:03:17.682
It weighs 24,000 pounds.

00:03:19.055 --> 00:03:21.032
It's 18 feet long.

00:03:21.056 --> 00:03:23.807
It's double-sided,
so it's 36 feet of composition.

00:03:23.831 --> 00:03:24.989
It's kind of weird.

00:03:26.798 --> 00:03:29.210
Well, that's the blood fountain.

00:03:29.234 --> 00:03:31.447
(Laughter)

00:03:31.471 --> 00:03:33.690
To the left, you have
Jesus and the locusts.

00:03:34.622 --> 00:03:35.829
There's a cave

00:03:35.853 --> 00:03:39.100
where all these animal-headed creatures
travel between two worlds.

00:03:39.124 --> 00:03:41.046
They go from the representational world,

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:43.954
to this analog-mesh underworld,
where they're hiding.

00:03:43.978 --> 00:03:47.041
This is where the animal-headed creatures
are by the lighthouse,

00:03:47.065 --> 00:03:49.904
and they're all about to commit
mass suicide into the ocean.

00:03:49.928 --> 00:03:52.896
The ocean is made up
of thousands of elements.

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:55.219
This is a bird god
tied up to a battleship.

00:03:55.243 --> 00:03:56.281
(Laughter)

00:03:56.305 --> 00:03:57.909
Billy Graham is in the ocean;

00:03:57.933 --> 00:04:02.160
the Horizon from the oil spill;
Waldo; Osama Bin Laden's shelter --

00:04:02.184 --> 00:04:04.527
there's all kinds of weird stuff
that you can find

00:04:04.551 --> 00:04:06.518
if you look really hard, in the ocean.

00:04:06.891 --> 00:04:09.310
Anyway, this is a lady creature.

00:04:09.334 --> 00:04:12.784
She's coming out of the ocean,
and she's spitting oil into one hand

00:04:12.808 --> 00:04:15.325
and she has clouds
coming out of her other hand.

00:04:15.349 --> 00:04:16.956
Her hands are like scales,

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:21.618
and she has the mythological reference
of the Earth and cosmos in balance.

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:24.031
So that's one side of "The Triptych."

00:04:24.055 --> 00:04:25.515
It's a little narrative thing.

00:04:25.539 --> 00:04:27.619
That's her hand that she's spitting into.

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:30.256
And then, when you go to the other side,

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:32.389
she has like a trunk, like a bird's beak,

00:04:32.413 --> 00:04:34.447
and she's spitting clouds
out of her trunk.

00:04:34.812 --> 00:04:38.507
Then she has an 18-foot-long serpent's
tail that connects "The Triptych."

00:04:38.896 --> 00:04:41.885
Anyway, her tail catches on fire
from the back of the volcano.

00:04:41.909 --> 00:04:42.986
(Laughter)

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:44.698
I don't know why that happened.

00:04:44.722 --> 00:04:46.280
(Laughter)

00:04:46.304 --> 00:04:47.779
That happens, you know.

00:04:48.623 --> 00:04:52.095
Her tail terminates
in a cycloptic eyeball,

00:04:52.119 --> 00:04:54.650
made out of 1986 terrorist cards.

00:04:54.674 --> 00:04:55.879
Have you guys seen those?

00:04:55.903 --> 00:04:59.301
They were made in the 1980's,
they're like baseball cards of terrorists.

00:04:59.325 --> 00:05:00.484
Way ahead of their time.

00:05:00.508 --> 00:05:02.841
(Laughter)

00:05:02.865 --> 00:05:04.862
That will bring you to my latest project.

00:05:04.886 --> 00:05:06.539
I'm in the middle of two projects:

00:05:06.563 --> 00:05:08.183
One's called "Psychogeographies."

00:05:08.207 --> 00:05:11.287
It's about a six-year project
to make 100 of these humans.

00:05:11.311 --> 00:05:13.681
Each one is an archive of our culture,

00:05:13.705 --> 00:05:15.704
through our ripped-up media and matter,

00:05:15.728 --> 00:05:19.012
whether it's encyclopedias
or dictionaries or magazines.

00:05:19.036 --> 00:05:22.209
But each one acts as a sort of an archive
in the shape of a human,

00:05:22.233 --> 00:05:25.642
and they travel in groups
of 20, 4, or 12 at a time.

00:05:25.666 --> 00:05:28.607
They're like cells --
they come together, they divide.

00:05:28.976 --> 00:05:31.612
And you kind of walk through them.
It's taking me years.

00:05:31.636 --> 00:05:35.621
Each one is basically
a 3,000-pound microscope slide

00:05:35.645 --> 00:05:37.582
with a human stuck inside.

00:05:38.358 --> 00:05:40.393
This one has a little cave in his chest.

00:05:40.829 --> 00:05:44.124
That's his head; there's the chest,
you can kind of see the beginning.

00:05:44.148 --> 00:05:46.179
I'm going to go down the body for you:

00:05:46.203 --> 00:05:50.241
There's a waterfall
coming out of his chest,

00:05:50.265 --> 00:05:52.869
covering his penis -- or not-penis,
or whatever it is,

00:05:52.893 --> 00:05:54.375
a kind of androgynous thing.

00:05:54.805 --> 00:05:57.694
I'll take you quickly through these works,

00:05:57.718 --> 00:06:00.575
because I can't explain them for too long.

00:06:00.599 --> 00:06:03.002
There are the layers,
you can kind of see it.

00:06:03.962 --> 00:06:06.152
That's a body getting split in half.

00:06:06.501 --> 00:06:07.748
This one has two heads,

00:06:07.772 --> 00:06:09.962
and it's communicating
between the two heads.

00:06:10.469 --> 00:06:12.245
You can see the pills coming out,

00:06:12.269 --> 00:06:14.610
going into one head
from this weird statue.

00:06:14.634 --> 00:06:17.465
There's a little forest scene
inside the chest cavity.

00:06:17.489 --> 00:06:18.647
Can you see that?

00:06:18.671 --> 00:06:20.758
Anyway, this talk's all about these boxes,

00:06:20.782 --> 00:06:22.300
like the boxes we're in.

00:06:23.054 --> 00:06:25.479
This box we're in,
the solar system is a box.

00:06:25.965 --> 00:06:27.892
This brings you to my latest box.

00:06:28.532 --> 00:06:30.983
It's a brick box.
It's called Pioneer Works.

00:06:31.007 --> 00:06:32.320
(Cheers)

00:06:32.344 --> 00:06:36.856
Inside of this box is a physicist,

00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:40.006
a neuroscientist, a painter, a musician,

00:06:40.030 --> 00:06:45.357
a writer, a radio station,
a museum, a school,

00:06:45.381 --> 00:06:50.538
a publishing arm to disseminate all
the content we make there into the world;

00:06:50.562 --> 00:06:51.719
a garden.

00:06:52.282 --> 00:06:53.679
We shake this box up,

00:06:53.703 --> 00:06:56.954
and all these people kind of start
hitting each other like particles.

00:06:56.978 --> 00:06:59.277
And I think that's the way
you change the world.

00:06:59.301 --> 00:07:03.183
You redefine your insides
and the box that you're living in.

00:07:03.207 --> 00:07:06.771
And you come together to realize
that we're all in this together,

00:07:06.795 --> 00:07:08.541
that this delusion of difference --

00:07:08.565 --> 00:07:13.635
this idea of countries, of borders,
of religion -- doesn't work.

00:07:14.081 --> 00:07:18.710
We're all really made up
of the same stuff, in the same box.

00:07:18.734 --> 00:07:22.758
And if we don't start
exchanging that stuff sweetly and nicely,

00:07:22.782 --> 00:07:24.901
we're all going to die real soon.

00:07:25.449 --> 00:07:26.639
Thank you very much.

00:07:27.162 --> 00:07:30.173
(Applause)
