00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:18.406
Imagine being unable to say,
"I am hungry," "I am in pain,"

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:20.966
"thank you," or "I love you."

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:23.086
Being trapped inside your body,

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:26.246
a body that doesn't respond to commands.

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:27.926
Surrounded by people,

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:29.566
yet utterly alone.

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:31.286
Wishing you could reach out,

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:35.526
to connect, to comfort, to participate.

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.630
For 13 long years, that was my reality.

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:45.206
Most of us never think twice
about talking, about communicating.

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:47.366
I've thought a lot about it.

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:50.046
I've had a lot of time to think.

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.166
For the first 12 years of my life,

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:54.886
I was a normal, happy, healthy little boy.

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:57.046
Then everything changed.

00:00:57.070 --> 00:00:59.326
I contracted a brain infection.

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:01.646
The doctors weren't sure what it was,

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:04.166
but they treated me the best they could.

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:07.566
However, I progressively got worse.

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:11.766
Eventually, I lost my ability
to control my movements,

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.126
make eye contact,

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:16.389
and finally, my ability to speak.

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:18.646
While in hospital,

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:21.246
I desperately wanted to go home.

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:24.566
I said to my mother, "When home?"

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:29.046
Those were the last words
I ever spoke with my own voice.

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.886
I would eventually fail every test
for mental awareness.

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:35.726
My parents were told
I was as good as not there.

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:40.366
A vegetable, having the intelligence
of a three-month-old baby.

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:44.046
They were told to take me home
and try to keep me comfortable

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:45.270
until I died.

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:49.686
My parents, in fact
my entire family's lives,

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:54.006
became consumed by taking care of me
the best they knew how.

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.366
Their friends drifted away.

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:58.206
One year turned to two,

00:01:58.230 --> 00:01:59.550
two turned to three.

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:04.806
It seemed like the person I once was
began to disappear.

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:09.726
The Lego blocks and electronic circuits
I'd loved as a boy were put away.

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:14.206
I had been moved out of my bedroom
into another more practical one.

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:15.926
I had become a ghost,

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:20.325
a faded memory of a boy
people once knew and loved.

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:24.606
Meanwhile, my mind began
knitting itself back together.

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:27.646
Gradually, my awareness started to return.

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:31.006
But no one realized
that I had come back to life.

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:32.846
I was aware of everything,

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:34.886
just like any normal person.

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:37.206
I could see and understand everything,

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:40.070
but I couldn't find a way
to let anybody know.

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:44.686
My personality was entombed
within a seemingly silent body,

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:48.430
a vibrant mind hidden in plain sight
within a chrysalis.

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:51.806
The stark reality hit me
that I was going to spend

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:54.486
the rest of my life locked inside myself,

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:56.206
totally alone.

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:59.846
I was trapped with only
my thoughts for company.

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:02.046
I would never be rescued.

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:05.006
No one would ever show me tenderness.

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:07.286
I would never talk to a friend.

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:09.230
No one would ever love me.

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:14.206
I had no dreams, no hope,
nothing to look forward to.

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:16.726
Well, nothing pleasant.

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:18.086
I lived in fear,

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:19.646
and, to put it bluntly,

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:22.726
was waiting for death
to finally release me,

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:26.646
expecting to die all alone in a care home.

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:30.046
I don't know if it's truly possible
to express in words

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:32.886
what it's like not to be able
to communicate.

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:36.326
Your personality appears
to vanish into a heavy fog

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:42.126
and all of your emotions and desires are
constricted, stifled and muted within you.

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:46.646
For me, the worst was the feeling
of utter powerlessness.

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:48.110
I simply existed.

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:51.286
It's a very dark place to find yourself

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:53.990
because in a sense, you have vanished.

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:58.366
Other people controlled
every aspect of my life.

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:00.686
They decided what I ate and when.

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:04.686
Whether I was laid on my side
or strapped into my wheelchair.

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:08.086
I often spent my days
positioned in front of the TV

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:09.950
watching Barney reruns.

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:13.486
I think because Barney
is so happy and jolly,

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:15.246
and I absolutely wasn't,

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:16.950
it made it so much worse.

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:21.366
I was completely powerless
to change anything in my life

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:23.846
or people's perceptions of me.

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:27.446
I was a silent, invisible observer
of how people behaved

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:29.846
when they thought no one was watching.

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:33.566
Unfortunately, I wasn't only an observer.

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:37.566
With no way to communicate,
I became the perfect victim:

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:41.566
a defenseless object,
seemingly devoid of feelings

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:45.326
that people used
to play out their darkest desires.

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:49.006
For more than 10 years,
people who were charged with my care

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:52.190
abused me physically,
verbally and sexually.

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:55.670
Despite what they thought, I did feel.

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:58.286
The first time it happened,

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:00.966
I was shocked and filled with disbelief.

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:02.510
How could they do this to me?

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:04.846
I was confused.

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:06.990
What had I done to deserve this?

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:11.646
Part of me wanted to cry
and another part wanted to fight.

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:15.406
Hurt, sadness and anger
flooded through me.

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:17.206
I felt worthless.

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:19.150
There was no one to comfort me.

00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:23.486
But neither of my parents
knew this was happening.

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:27.566
I lived in terror, knowing
it would happen again and again.

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:29.686
I just never knew when.

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:32.470
All I knew was that I would
never be the same.

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:37.126
I remember once listening
to Whitney Houston singing,

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:42.006
"No matter what they take from me,
they can't take away my dignity."

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:44.950
And I thought to myself,
"You want to bet?"

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:51.006
Perhaps my parents could have
found out and could have helped.

00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:53.286
But the years of constant caretaking,

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:56.206
having to wake up
every two hours to turn me,

00:05:56.230 --> 00:05:59.606
combined with them essentially
grieving the loss of their son,

00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:02.966
had taken a toll on my mother and father.

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:06.566
Following yet another heated argument
between my parents,

00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:09.206
in a moment of despair and desperation,

00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:12.550
my mother turned to me
and told me that I should die.

00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:17.446
I was shocked, but as I thought
about what she had said,

00:06:17.470 --> 00:06:21.486
I was filled with enormous compassion
and love for my mother,

00:06:21.510 --> 00:06:23.470
yet I could do nothing about it.

00:06:24.790 --> 00:06:27.166
There were many moments when I gave up,

00:06:27.190 --> 00:06:29.566
sinking into a dark abyss.

00:06:29.590 --> 00:06:32.726
I remember one particularly low moment.

00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:35.006
My dad left me alone in the car

00:06:35.030 --> 00:06:38.606
while he quickly went
to buy something from the store.

00:06:38.630 --> 00:06:41.246
A random stranger walked past,

00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:44.110
looked at me and he smiled.

00:06:45.030 --> 00:06:48.166
I may never know why, but that simple act,

00:06:48.190 --> 00:06:50.486
the fleeting moment of human connection,

00:06:50.510 --> 00:06:52.886
transformed how I was feeling,

00:06:52.910 --> 00:06:54.830
making me want to keep going.

00:06:55.910 --> 00:06:58.846
My existence was tortured by monotony,

00:06:58.870 --> 00:07:01.886
a reality that was often too much to bear.

00:07:01.910 --> 00:07:06.046
Alone with my thoughts,
I constructed intricate fantasies

00:07:06.070 --> 00:07:09.446
about ants running across the floor.

00:07:09.470 --> 00:07:14.566
I taught myself to tell the time
by noticing where the shadows were.

00:07:14.590 --> 00:07:18.726
As I learned how the shadows moved
as the hours of the day passed,

00:07:18.750 --> 00:07:23.406
I understood how long it would be
before I was picked up and taken home.

00:07:23.430 --> 00:07:26.686
Seeing my father walk
through the door to collect me

00:07:26.710 --> 00:07:28.870
was the best moment of the day.

00:07:29.750 --> 00:07:32.086
My mind became a tool that I could use

00:07:32.110 --> 00:07:34.926
to either close down
to retreat from my reality

00:07:34.950 --> 00:07:39.926
or enlarge into a gigantic space
that I could fill with fantasies.

00:07:39.950 --> 00:07:41.926
I hoped that my reality would change

00:07:41.950 --> 00:07:44.806
and someone would see
that I had come back to life.

00:07:44.830 --> 00:07:47.526
But I had been washed away
like a sand castle

00:07:47.550 --> 00:07:49.686
built too close to the waves,

00:07:49.710 --> 00:07:53.886
and in my place was the person
people expected me to be.

00:07:53.910 --> 00:07:57.686
To some I was Martin,
a vacant shell, the vegetable,

00:07:57.710 --> 00:08:02.126
deserving of harsh words,
dismissal and even abuse.

00:08:02.150 --> 00:08:05.086
To others, I was the tragically
brain-damaged boy

00:08:05.110 --> 00:08:07.326
who had grown to become a man.

00:08:07.350 --> 00:08:10.526
Someone they were kind to and cared for.

00:08:10.550 --> 00:08:13.046
Good or bad, I was a blank canvas

00:08:13.070 --> 00:08:16.390
onto which different versions
of myself were projected.

00:08:17.310 --> 00:08:20.606
It took someone new
to see me in a different way.

00:08:20.630 --> 00:08:24.886
An aromatherapist began coming
to the care home about once a week.

00:08:24.910 --> 00:08:27.886
Whether through intuition
or her attention to details

00:08:27.910 --> 00:08:29.926
that others failed to notice,

00:08:29.950 --> 00:08:34.086
she became convinced that I could
understand what was being said.

00:08:34.110 --> 00:08:37.606
She urged my parents
to have me tested by experts

00:08:37.630 --> 00:08:40.926
in augmentative
and alternative communication.

00:08:40.950 --> 00:08:42.166
And within a year,

00:08:42.190 --> 00:08:46.246
I was beginning to use
a computer program to communicate.

00:08:46.270 --> 00:08:50.006
It was exhilarating,
but frustrating at times.

00:08:50.030 --> 00:08:52.006
I had so many words in my mind,

00:08:52.030 --> 00:08:54.846
that I couldn't wait
to be able to share them.

00:08:54.870 --> 00:08:59.606
Sometimes, I would say things to myself
simply because I could.

00:08:59.630 --> 00:09:02.246
In myself, I had a ready audience,

00:09:02.270 --> 00:09:05.406
and I believed that by expressing
my thoughts and wishes,

00:09:05.430 --> 00:09:07.166
others would listen, too.

00:09:07.190 --> 00:09:09.446
But as I began to communicate more,

00:09:09.470 --> 00:09:12.646
I realized that it was in fact
only just the beginning

00:09:12.670 --> 00:09:15.606
of creating a new voice for myself.

00:09:15.630 --> 00:09:19.966
I was thrust into a world
I didn't quite know how to function in.

00:09:19.990 --> 00:09:21.646
I stopped going to the care home

00:09:21.670 --> 00:09:25.526
and managed to get my first job
making photocopies.

00:09:25.550 --> 00:09:29.006
As simple as this may sound,
it was amazing.

00:09:29.030 --> 00:09:31.046
My new world was really exciting

00:09:31.070 --> 00:09:33.886
but often quite overwhelming
and frightening.

00:09:33.910 --> 00:09:35.726
I was like a man-child,

00:09:35.750 --> 00:09:37.846
and as liberating as it often was,

00:09:37.870 --> 00:09:39.606
I struggled.

00:09:39.630 --> 00:09:43.166
I also learned that many of those
who had known me for a long time

00:09:43.190 --> 00:09:47.846
found it impossible to abandon the idea
of Martin they had in their heads.

00:09:47.870 --> 00:09:49.486
While those I had only just met

00:09:49.510 --> 00:09:53.270
struggled to look past the image
of a silent man in a wheelchair.

00:09:54.150 --> 00:09:56.886
I realized that some people
would only listen to me

00:09:56.910 --> 00:09:59.926
if what I said was in line
with what they expected.

00:09:59.950 --> 00:10:01.966
Otherwise, it was disregarded

00:10:01.990 --> 00:10:04.646
and they did what they felt was best.

00:10:04.670 --> 00:10:06.686
I discovered that true communication

00:10:06.710 --> 00:10:10.526
is about more than merely
physically conveying a message.

00:10:10.550 --> 00:10:13.510
It is about getting the message
heard and respected.

00:10:15.110 --> 00:10:17.366
Still, things were going well.

00:10:17.390 --> 00:10:19.966
My body was slowly getting stronger.

00:10:19.990 --> 00:10:22.446
I had a job in computing that I loved,

00:10:22.470 --> 00:10:27.366
and had even got Kojak, the dog
I had been dreaming about for years.

00:10:27.390 --> 00:10:31.326
However, I longed to share
my life with someone.

00:10:31.350 --> 00:10:35.766
I remember staring out the window
as my dad drove me home from work,

00:10:35.790 --> 00:10:40.486
thinking I have so much love inside of me
and nobody to give it to.

00:10:40.510 --> 00:10:44.966
Just as I had resigned myself
to being single for the rest of my life,

00:10:44.990 --> 00:10:46.766
I met Joan.

00:10:46.790 --> 00:10:50.246
Not only is she the best thing
that has ever happened to me,

00:10:50.270 --> 00:10:55.166
but Joan helped me to challenge
my own misconceptions about myself.

00:10:55.190 --> 00:10:59.806
Joan said it was through my words
that she fell in love with me.

00:10:59.830 --> 00:11:02.606
However, after all I had been through,

00:11:02.630 --> 00:11:04.366
I still couldn't shake the belief

00:11:04.390 --> 00:11:07.606
that nobody could truly see
beyond my disability

00:11:07.630 --> 00:11:10.206
and accept me for who I am.

00:11:10.230 --> 00:11:14.406
I also really struggled
to comprehend that I was a man.

00:11:14.430 --> 00:11:17.246
The first time someone
referred to me as a man,

00:11:17.270 --> 00:11:19.566
it stopped me in my tracks.

00:11:19.590 --> 00:11:24.206
I felt like looking around
and asking, "Who, me?"

00:11:24.230 --> 00:11:26.406
That all changed with Joan.

00:11:26.430 --> 00:11:28.006
We have an amazing connection

00:11:28.030 --> 00:11:32.686
and I learned how important it is
to communicate openly and honestly.

00:11:32.710 --> 00:11:37.646
I felt safe, and it gave me the confidence
to truly say what I thought.

00:11:37.670 --> 00:11:41.966
I started to feel whole again,
a man worthy of love.

00:11:41.990 --> 00:11:44.446
I began to reshape my destiny.

00:11:44.470 --> 00:11:46.686
I spoke up a little more at work.

00:11:46.710 --> 00:11:51.086
I asserted my need for independence
to the people around me.

00:11:51.110 --> 00:11:54.966
Being given a means of communication
changed everything.

00:11:54.990 --> 00:11:59.206
I used the power of words and will
to challenge the preconceptions

00:11:59.230 --> 00:12:02.806
of those around me
and those I had of myself.

00:12:02.830 --> 00:12:05.526
Communication is what makes us human,

00:12:05.550 --> 00:12:07.846
enabling us to connect
on the deepest level

00:12:07.870 --> 00:12:09.806
with those around us --

00:12:09.830 --> 00:12:11.406
telling our own stories,

00:12:11.430 --> 00:12:15.046
expressing wants, needs and desires,

00:12:15.070 --> 00:12:18.206
or hearing those of others
by really listening.

00:12:18.230 --> 00:12:21.566
All this is how the world
knows who we are.

00:12:21.590 --> 00:12:23.390
So who are we without it?

00:12:24.630 --> 00:12:27.806
True communication increases understanding

00:12:27.830 --> 00:12:30.870
and creates a more caring
and compassionate world.

00:12:31.950 --> 00:12:35.046
Once, I was perceived
to be an inanimate object,

00:12:35.070 --> 00:12:38.366
a mindless phantom
of a boy in a wheelchair.

00:12:38.390 --> 00:12:40.646
Today, I am so much more.

00:12:40.670 --> 00:12:43.086
A husband, a son, a friend,

00:12:43.110 --> 00:12:47.366
a brother, a business owner,
a first-class honors graduate,

00:12:47.390 --> 00:12:49.726
a keen amateur photographer.

00:12:49.750 --> 00:12:53.590
It is my ability to communicate
that has given me all this.

00:12:54.470 --> 00:12:58.166
We are told that actions
speak louder than words.

00:12:58.190 --> 00:13:00.126
But I wonder,

00:13:00.150 --> 00:13:01.350
do they?

00:13:03.030 --> 00:13:05.686
Our words, however we communicate them,

00:13:05.710 --> 00:13:07.806
are just as powerful.

00:13:07.830 --> 00:13:10.566
Whether we speak the words
with our own voices,

00:13:10.590 --> 00:13:11.926
type them with our eyes,

00:13:11.950 --> 00:13:16.206
or communicate them non-verbally
to someone who speaks them for us,

00:13:16.230 --> 00:13:19.110
words are among our most powerful tools.

00:13:20.550 --> 00:13:23.366
I have come to you through
a terrible darkness,

00:13:23.390 --> 00:13:25.486
pulled from it by caring souls

00:13:25.510 --> 00:13:27.846
and by language itself.

00:13:27.870 --> 00:13:31.886
The act of you listening to me today
brings me farther into the light.

00:13:31.910 --> 00:13:34.206
We are shining here together.

00:13:34.230 --> 00:13:38.526
If there is one most difficult obstacle
to my way of communicating,

00:13:38.550 --> 00:13:40.486
it is that sometimes I want to shout

00:13:40.510 --> 00:13:44.806
and other times simply to whisper
a word of love or gratitude.

00:13:44.830 --> 00:13:47.086
It all sounds the same.

00:13:47.110 --> 00:13:48.526
But if you will,

00:13:48.550 --> 00:13:52.310
please imagine these next two words
as warmly as you can:

00:13:54.630 --> 00:13:55.830
Thank you.

00:13:56.430 --> 00:14:07.230
(Applause)
