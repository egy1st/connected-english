WEBVTT

00:00:14.086 --> 00:00:18.467
Can we, as adults, grow new nerve cells?

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:22.387
There's still some confusion
about that question,

00:00:22.411 --> 00:00:25.021
as this is a fairly new field of research.

00:00:25.719 --> 00:00:29.078
For example, I was talking
to one of my colleagues, Robert,

00:00:29.102 --> 00:00:30.410
who is an oncologist,

00:00:30.434 --> 00:00:31.735
and he was telling me,

00:00:32.164 --> 00:00:33.919
"Sandrine, this is puzzling.

00:00:33.943 --> 00:00:38.257
Some of my patients that have been told
they are cured of their cancer

00:00:38.281 --> 00:00:40.678
still develop symptoms of depression."

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:42.965
And I responded to him,

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:45.329
"Well, from my point of view
that makes sense.

00:00:45.353 --> 00:00:49.891
The drug you give to your patients
that stops the cancer cells multiplying

00:00:49.915 --> 00:00:55.018
also stops the newborn neurons
being generated in their brain."

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:58.756
And then Robert looked at me
like I was crazy and said,

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:00.962
"But Sandrine, these are adult patients --

00:01:00.986 --> 00:01:03.558
adults do not grow new nerve cells."

00:01:04.693 --> 00:01:08.359
And much to his surprise, I said,
"Well actually, we do."

00:01:09.248 --> 00:01:14.074
And this is a phenomenon
that we call neurogenesis.

00:01:14.098 --> 00:01:15.288
[Neurogenesis]

00:01:15.312 --> 00:01:19.082
Now Robert is not a neuroscientist,

00:01:19.106 --> 00:01:23.731
and when he went to medical school
he was not taught what we know now --

00:01:23.755 --> 00:01:27.494
that the adult brain
can generate new nerve cells.

00:01:29.367 --> 00:01:33.737
So Robert, you know,
being the good doctor that he is,

00:01:33.761 --> 00:01:35.460
wanted to come to my lab

00:01:35.484 --> 00:01:38.308
to understand the topic
a little bit better.

00:01:39.031 --> 00:01:41.286
And I took him for a tour

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.223
of one of the most exciting
parts of the brain

00:01:44.247 --> 00:01:46.420
when it comes to neurogenesis --

00:01:46.444 --> 00:01:48.532
and this is the hippocampus.

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:53.082
So this is this gray structure
in the center of the brain.

00:01:53.763 --> 00:01:56.185
And what we've known already
for very long,

00:01:56.209 --> 00:02:00.974
is that this is important for learning,
memory, mood and emotion.

00:02:01.493 --> 00:02:04.540
However, what we
have learned more recently

00:02:04.564 --> 00:02:09.222
is that this is one of the unique
structures of the adult brain

00:02:09.246 --> 00:02:11.896
where new neurons can be generated.

00:02:12.555 --> 00:02:14.866
And if we slice through the hippocampus

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:16.158
and zoom in,

00:02:16.182 --> 00:02:18.983
what you actually see here in blue

00:02:19.007 --> 00:02:23.580
is a newborn neuron
in an adult mouse brain.

00:02:24.919 --> 00:02:27.974
So when it comes to the human brain --

00:02:27.998 --> 00:02:31.530
my colleague Jonas FrisÃ©n
from the Karolinska Institutet,

00:02:31.554 --> 00:02:37.294
has estimated that we produce
700 new neurons per day

00:02:37.318 --> 00:02:38.516
in the hippocampus.

00:02:39.333 --> 00:02:41.008
You might think this is not much,

00:02:41.032 --> 00:02:43.421
compared to the billions
of neurons we have.

00:02:43.794 --> 00:02:46.865
But by the time we turn 50,

00:02:46.889 --> 00:02:51.565
we will have all exchanged the neurons
we were born with in that structure

00:02:51.589 --> 00:02:53.804
with adult-born neurons.

00:02:55.398 --> 00:03:00.434
So why are these new neurons important
and what are their functions?

00:03:01.474 --> 00:03:05.172
First, we know that they're important
for learning and memory.

00:03:05.196 --> 00:03:06.713
And in the lab we have shown

00:03:06.737 --> 00:03:09.973
that if we block the ability
of the adult brain

00:03:09.997 --> 00:03:12.557
to produce new neurons in the hippocampus,

00:03:12.581 --> 00:03:15.097
then we block certain memory abilities.

00:03:15.871 --> 00:03:22.783
And this is especially new and true
for spatial recognition --

00:03:22.807 --> 00:03:25.605
so like, how you navigate
your way in the city.

00:03:26.331 --> 00:03:27.809
We are still learning a lot,

00:03:27.833 --> 00:03:30.896
and neurons are not only important
for memory capacity,

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:33.823
but also for the quality of the memory.

00:03:33.847 --> 00:03:37.892
And they will have been helpful
to add time to our memory

00:03:37.916 --> 00:03:42.598
and they will help differentiate
very similar memories, like:

00:03:42.622 --> 00:03:44.702
how do you find your bike

00:03:44.726 --> 00:03:48.242
that you park at the station
every day in the same area,

00:03:48.266 --> 00:03:50.408
but in a slightly different position?

00:03:52.218 --> 00:03:54.702
And more interesting
to my colleague Robert

00:03:54.726 --> 00:03:59.588
is the research we have been doing
on neurogenesis and depression.

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:02.098
So in an animal model of depression,

00:04:02.122 --> 00:04:06.126
we have seen that we have
a lower level of neurogenesis.

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:08.893
And if we give antidepressants,

00:04:08.917 --> 00:04:12.371
then we increase the production
of these newborn neurons,

00:04:12.395 --> 00:04:15.538
and we decrease
the symptoms of depression,

00:04:15.562 --> 00:04:21.022
establishing a clear link
between neurogenesis and depression.

00:04:21.341 --> 00:04:25.650
But moreover, if you
just block neurogenesis,

00:04:25.674 --> 00:04:28.507
then you block the efficacy
of the antidepressant.

00:04:29.864 --> 00:04:31.627
So by then, Robert had understood

00:04:31.651 --> 00:04:35.349
that very likely his patients
were suffering from depression

00:04:35.373 --> 00:04:37.968
even after being cured of their cancer,

00:04:37.992 --> 00:04:42.373
because the cancer drug had stopped
newborn neurons from being generated.

00:04:42.397 --> 00:04:46.025
And it will take time
to generate new neurons

00:04:46.049 --> 00:04:48.255
that reach normal functions.

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:54.339
So, collectively, now we think
we have enough evidence

00:04:54.363 --> 00:04:58.078
to say that neurogenesis
is a target of choice

00:04:58.102 --> 00:05:01.716
if we want to improve
memory formation or mood,

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:05.303
or even prevent the decline
associated with aging,

00:05:05.327 --> 00:05:07.461
or associated with stress.

00:05:08.438 --> 00:05:10.169
So the next question is:

00:05:10.193 --> 00:05:12.367
can we control neurogenesis?

00:05:13.216 --> 00:05:14.407
The answer is yes.

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:17.573
And we are now going to do a little quiz.

00:05:18.351 --> 00:05:21.532
I'm going to give you a set
of behaviors and activities,

00:05:21.556 --> 00:05:26.240
and you tell me if you think
they will increase neurogenesis

00:05:26.264 --> 00:05:28.430
or if they will decrease neurogenesis.

00:05:28.954 --> 00:05:30.113
Are we ready?

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:31.859
OK, let's go.

00:05:32.184 --> 00:05:33.771
So what about learning?

00:05:34.671 --> 00:05:35.851
Increasing?

00:05:35.875 --> 00:05:37.034
Yes.

00:05:37.058 --> 00:05:40.844
Learning will increase the production
of these new neurons.

00:05:40.868 --> 00:05:42.184
How about stress?

00:05:43.581 --> 00:05:48.318
Yes, stress will decrease the production
of new neurons in the hippocampus.

00:05:48.342 --> 00:05:49.954
How about sleep deprivation?

00:05:51.525 --> 00:05:54.224
Indeed, it will decrease neurogenesis.

00:05:54.248 --> 00:05:55.469
How about sex?

00:05:56.564 --> 00:05:57.716
Oh, wow!

00:05:57.740 --> 00:05:59.007
(Laughter)

00:05:59.031 --> 00:06:02.784
Yes, you are right, it will increase
the production of new neurons.

00:06:02.808 --> 00:06:04.960
However, it's all about balance here.

00:06:04.984 --> 00:06:07.197
We don't want to fall in a situation --

00:06:07.221 --> 00:06:09.149
(Laughter)

00:06:09.173 --> 00:06:12.007
about too much sex
leading to sleep deprivation.

00:06:12.031 --> 00:06:14.260
(Laughter)

00:06:14.903 --> 00:06:17.094
How about getting older?

00:06:19.795 --> 00:06:23.478
So the neurogenesis rate
will decrease as we get older,

00:06:23.502 --> 00:06:25.248
but it is still occurring.

00:06:26.192 --> 00:06:28.383
And then finally, how about running?

00:06:30.062 --> 00:06:32.871
I will let you judge that one by yourself.

00:06:33.713 --> 00:06:35.509
So this is one of the first studies

00:06:35.533 --> 00:06:39.936
that was carried out by one of my mentors,
Rusty Gage from the Salk Institute,

00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:42.234
showing that the environment
can have an impact

00:06:42.258 --> 00:06:44.147
on the production of new neurons.

00:06:44.171 --> 00:06:48.425
And here you see a section
of the hippocampus of a mouse

00:06:48.449 --> 00:06:50.694
that had no running wheel in its cage.

00:06:50.718 --> 00:06:54.753
And the little black dots you see
are actually newborn neurons-to-be.

00:06:55.396 --> 00:07:00.534
And now, you see a section
of the hippocampus of a mouse

00:07:00.558 --> 00:07:03.154
that had a running wheel in its cage.

00:07:03.178 --> 00:07:04.701
So you see the massive increase

00:07:04.725 --> 00:07:07.538
of the black dots representing
the new neurons-to-be.

00:07:08.969 --> 00:07:12.762
So activity impacts neurogenesis,
but that's not all.

00:07:13.789 --> 00:07:16.436
What you eat will have an effect

00:07:16.460 --> 00:07:19.374
on the production of new neurons
in the hippocampus.

00:07:19.398 --> 00:07:22.358
So here we have a sample of diet --

00:07:22.382 --> 00:07:25.659
of nutrients that have been shown
to have efficacy.

00:07:26.123 --> 00:07:28.718
And I'm just going
to point a few out to you:

00:07:28.742 --> 00:07:33.836
Calorie restriction of 20 to 30 percent
will increase neurogenesis.

00:07:34.278 --> 00:07:37.760
Intermittent fasting --
spacing the time between your meals --

00:07:37.784 --> 00:07:39.923
will increase neurogenesis.

00:07:39.947 --> 00:07:41.270
Intake of flavonoids,

00:07:41.294 --> 00:07:44.297
which are contained
in dark chocolate or blueberries,

00:07:44.321 --> 00:07:46.144
will increase neurogenesis.

00:07:46.505 --> 00:07:48.011
Omega-3 fatty acids,

00:07:48.035 --> 00:07:50.246
present in fatty fish, like salmon,

00:07:50.270 --> 00:07:52.708
will increase the production
of these new neurons.

00:07:53.652 --> 00:07:57.753
Conversely, a diet rich
in high saturated fat

00:07:57.777 --> 00:08:00.517
will have a negative impact
on neurogenesis.

00:08:01.382 --> 00:08:05.564
Ethanol -- intake of alcohol --
will decrease neurogenesis.

00:08:06.131 --> 00:08:08.853
However, not everything is lost;

00:08:08.877 --> 00:08:11.929
resveratrol, which is
contained in red wine,

00:08:11.953 --> 00:08:15.444
has been shown to promote
the survival of these new neurons.

00:08:15.858 --> 00:08:17.724
So next time you are at a dinner party,

00:08:17.748 --> 00:08:21.752
you might want to reach for this possibly
"neurogenesis-neutral" drink.

00:08:22.059 --> 00:08:24.192
(Laughter)

00:08:24.216 --> 00:08:26.717
And then finally,
let me point out the last one --

00:08:26.741 --> 00:08:27.899
a quirky one.

00:08:27.923 --> 00:08:31.818
So Japanese groups are fascinated
with food textures,

00:08:31.842 --> 00:08:37.145
and they have shown that actually
soft diet impairs neurogenesis,

00:08:37.169 --> 00:08:41.890
as opposed to food that requires
mastication -- chewing -- or crunchy food.

00:08:42.977 --> 00:08:44.770
So all of this data,

00:08:44.794 --> 00:08:47.375
where we need to look
at the cellular level,

00:08:47.399 --> 00:08:49.906
has been generated using animal models.

00:08:50.620 --> 00:08:55.001
But this diet has also been given
to human participants,

00:08:55.025 --> 00:09:01.183
and what we could see is that
the diet modulates memory and mood

00:09:01.207 --> 00:09:04.691
in the same direction
as it modulates neurogenesis,

00:09:04.715 --> 00:09:09.472
such as: calorie restriction
will improve memory capacity,

00:09:09.496 --> 00:09:14.595
whereas a high-fat diet will exacerbate
symptoms of depression --

00:09:14.619 --> 00:09:18.483
as opposed to omega-3 fatty acids,
which increase neurogenesis,

00:09:18.507 --> 00:09:22.690
and also help to decrease
the symptoms of depression.

00:09:23.793 --> 00:09:28.610
So we think that the effect of diet

00:09:28.634 --> 00:09:32.229
on mental health, on memory and mood,

00:09:32.253 --> 00:09:36.725
is actually mediated by the production
of the new neurons in the hippocampus.

00:09:37.144 --> 00:09:39.064
And it's not only what you eat,

00:09:39.088 --> 00:09:42.153
but it's also the texture
of the food, when you eat it

00:09:42.177 --> 00:09:44.001
and how much of it you eat.

00:09:45.991 --> 00:09:50.024
On our side -- neuroscientists
interested in neurogenesis --

00:09:50.048 --> 00:09:53.713
we need to understand better
the function of these new neurons,

00:09:53.737 --> 00:09:57.721
and how we can control their survival
and their production.

00:09:58.046 --> 00:10:02.585
We also need to find a way to protect
the neurogenesis of Robert's patients.

00:10:03.421 --> 00:10:04.798
And on your side --

00:10:04.822 --> 00:10:07.252
I leave you in charge
of your neurogenesis.

00:10:07.841 --> 00:10:08.999
Thank you.

00:10:09.023 --> 00:10:14.982
(Applause)

00:10:15.006 --> 00:10:17.338
Margaret Heffernan:
Fantastic research, Sandrine.

00:10:17.362 --> 00:10:19.607
Now, I told you you changed my life --

00:10:19.631 --> 00:10:21.409
I now eat a lot of blueberries.

00:10:21.433 --> 00:10:22.980
Sandrine Thuret: Very good.

00:10:23.678 --> 00:10:26.122
MH: I'm really interested
in the running thing.

00:10:27.019 --> 00:10:28.670
Do I have to run?

00:10:29.518 --> 00:10:32.160
Or is it really just
about aerobic exercise,

00:10:32.184 --> 00:10:33.789
getting oxygen to the brain?

00:10:33.813 --> 00:10:35.948
Could it be any kind of vigorous exercise?

00:10:36.251 --> 00:10:37.988
ST: So for the moment,

00:10:38.012 --> 00:10:41.252
we can't really say
if it's just the running itself,

00:10:41.276 --> 00:10:46.313
but we think that anything that indeed
will increase the production --

00:10:46.337 --> 00:10:49.417
or moving the blood flow to the brain,

00:10:49.441 --> 00:10:51.043
should be beneficial.

00:10:51.503 --> 00:10:54.130
MH: So I don't have to get
a running wheel in my office?

00:10:54.154 --> 00:10:55.317
ST: No, you don't!

00:10:55.341 --> 00:10:57.434
