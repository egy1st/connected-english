00:00:18.587 --> 00:00:20.594
(Guitar music)

00:00:27.276 --> 00:00:30.132
I was just thinking

00:00:32.268 --> 00:00:36.680
that I have been missing you way too long

00:00:37.676 --> 00:00:42.844
There's something inside this weary head

00:00:42.868 --> 00:00:47.894
that wants us to love just instead

00:00:47.918 --> 00:00:51.063
But I was just thinking,

00:00:52.951 --> 00:00:57.749
merely thinking

00:01:00.495 --> 00:01:04.073
I've got loads of pictures,

00:01:06.062 --> 00:01:11.205
I've got the one of you
in that dancing dress

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:16.347
But man I feel silly in that dim light

00:01:16.371 --> 00:01:21.804
Just after doing you
by the sight of my Kodak delights,

00:01:21.828 --> 00:01:26.200
I am sinking,

00:01:26.224 --> 00:01:29.281
merely sinking

00:01:33.685 --> 00:01:40.018
I think about long distance rates
instead of kissing you babe

00:01:40.042 --> 00:01:44.960
I'm a singer without a song

00:01:44.984 --> 00:01:47.495
If I wait for you longer

00:01:47.519 --> 00:01:50.949
my affection is stronger

00:01:50.973 --> 00:01:56.966
and I ... I was just thinking,

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:02.406
merely thinking

00:02:04.353 --> 00:02:08.126
that this boat is sinking

00:02:19.643 --> 00:02:22.824
I'm tired of postcards,

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:29.952
especially the ones
with cute dogs and cupids

00:02:30.677 --> 00:02:35.060
I'm tired of calling you and missing you

00:02:35.084 --> 00:02:37.965
and dreaming I slept with you

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:42.249
Don't get me wrong
I still desperately love you

00:02:42.273 --> 00:02:46.026
inside this weary head

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:50.710
I just want us to love just instead

00:02:50.734 --> 00:02:56.563
But I was just thinking and thinking,

00:02:56.587 --> 00:03:00.212
merely thinking

00:03:04.229 --> 00:03:10.440
I think about long distance rates
instead of kissing you babe

00:03:10.464 --> 00:03:15.190
and time is running me still

00:03:15.214 --> 00:03:17.794
If I wait for you longer

00:03:17.818 --> 00:03:21.752
my affection is stronger

00:03:21.776 --> 00:03:27.072
I ... I was just thinking

00:03:31.023 --> 00:03:37.100
I ... I was just thinking

00:03:39.465 --> 00:03:43.781
that I'm tired of calling you once a week

00:03:43.805 --> 00:03:50.131
thinking of long distance rates
instead of kissing you

00:03:50.155 --> 00:03:56.054
So baby I'm sinking,

00:03:56.078 --> 00:03:58.252
merely sinking

00:03:59.938 --> 00:04:01.938
(Guitar music ends)

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:09.663
(Applause)

00:04:10.015 --> 00:04:11.172
Thank you.

00:04:12.553 --> 00:04:14.729
Singing is sharing.

00:04:16.464 --> 00:04:20.758
When you sing, you have to know
what you're talking about intimately,

00:04:20.782 --> 00:04:24.068
and you have to be willing
to share this insight

00:04:24.092 --> 00:04:26.181
and give away a piece of yourself.

00:04:26.205 --> 00:04:30.718
I look for this intention
to share in everything,

00:04:30.742 --> 00:04:36.349
and I ask: what are the intentions
behind this architecture or this product

00:04:36.373 --> 00:04:38.424
or this restaurant or this meal?

00:04:39.046 --> 00:04:42.130
And if your intentions
are to impress people

00:04:42.154 --> 00:04:44.760
or to get the big applause at the end,

00:04:44.784 --> 00:04:47.022
then you are taking, not giving.

00:04:48.343 --> 00:04:50.812
And this is a song that's about --

00:04:50.836 --> 00:04:53.534
it's the kind of song that everyone
has their version of.

00:04:53.558 --> 00:04:55.722
This song is called "Home,"

00:04:55.746 --> 00:04:59.492
and it's sort of a "This is where
I'm from, nice to meet you all,"

00:04:59.516 --> 00:05:00.668
kind of song.

00:05:00.692 --> 00:05:02.889
(Laughter)

00:05:02.913 --> 00:05:06.689
(Applause)

00:05:09.336 --> 00:05:11.336
(Piano music)

00:05:55.329 --> 00:06:01.412
Home is the sound of birds
early in the morning

00:06:02.015 --> 00:06:06.695
Home is a song I've always remembered

00:06:06.719 --> 00:06:11.714
Home is the memory
of my first day in school

00:06:11.738 --> 00:06:16.377
Home is the books that I carry around

00:06:16.401 --> 00:06:20.882
Home is an alley in a faraway town

00:06:20.906 --> 00:06:26.734
Home is the places I’ve been
and where I’d like to go

00:06:30.892 --> 00:06:33.107
Home

00:06:33.131 --> 00:06:37.401
I'm always gonna feel at home

00:06:37.425 --> 00:06:42.035
No matter where I may roam

00:06:42.059 --> 00:06:46.376
I'm always gonna find my way back home

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:50.201
No matter how far I’m gone

00:06:50.225 --> 00:06:57.153
I’m always gonna feel this longing

00:06:57.177 --> 00:07:03.048
No matter where I might stay

00:07:07.990 --> 00:07:12.845
Home is a feather twirling in the air

00:07:12.869 --> 00:07:17.978
Home is flowers in a windowsill

00:07:18.002 --> 00:07:21.448
Home is all the things she said to me

00:07:22.901 --> 00:07:26.377
Home is a photo I never threw away

00:07:27.631 --> 00:07:31.790
Home is the smile on my face when I die

00:07:32.925 --> 00:07:38.099
Home is the taste of an apple pie

00:07:44.325 --> 00:07:50.810
I met a woman, she always lived
in the same place

00:07:52.079 --> 00:07:57.523
And she said home is where
you’re born and raised

00:08:00.870 --> 00:08:06.668
And I met a man, he sat
looking out to the sea

00:08:07.866 --> 00:08:13.750
And he said home is where you want to be

00:08:16.870 --> 00:08:23.135
I met a girl in some downtown bar

00:08:24.027 --> 00:08:29.349
And she said I'll have
whatever he's having

00:08:32.381 --> 00:08:37.320
And I asked her how come
we never met before?

00:08:38.637 --> 00:08:45.496
And she said all my life I’ve been trying

00:08:45.520 --> 00:08:48.257
to get a place of my own

00:08:49.732 --> 00:08:53.199
I’m always gonna feel at home

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:57.415
No matter where I may roam

00:08:58.669 --> 00:09:02.927
Always gonna find my way back home

00:09:02.951 --> 00:09:06.481
No matter how far I’m gone

00:09:06.966 --> 00:09:12.628
I'm always gonna feel this longing

00:09:13.667 --> 00:09:19.335
No matter where I might stay

00:09:22.183 --> 00:09:24.183
(Piano music)

00:10:28.990 --> 00:10:30.990
(Piano music ends)

00:10:37.350 --> 00:10:44.296
(Applause)
