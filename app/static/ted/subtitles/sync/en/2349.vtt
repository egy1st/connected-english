WEBVTT

00:00:12.966 --> 00:00:15.538
We all go to doctors.

00:00:17.094 --> 00:00:21.432
And we do so with trust and blind faith

00:00:21.456 --> 00:00:25.314
that the test they are ordering
and the medications they're prescribing

00:00:25.338 --> 00:00:28.513
are based upon evidence --

00:00:28.537 --> 00:00:31.464
evidence that's designed to help us.

00:00:32.488 --> 00:00:38.331
However, the reality is that that hasn't
always been the case for everyone.

00:00:39.236 --> 00:00:40.531
What if I told you

00:00:40.555 --> 00:00:44.501
that the medical science discovered
over the past century

00:00:44.525 --> 00:00:48.192
has been based on only
half the population?

00:00:48.216 --> 00:00:50.510
I'm an emergency medicine doctor.

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:54.550
I was trained to be prepared
in a medical emergency.

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:59.539
It's about saving lives. How cool is that?

00:01:00.642 --> 00:01:03.802
OK, there's a lot of runny noses
and stubbed toes,

00:01:03.826 --> 00:01:07.491
but no matter who walks
through the door to the ER,

00:01:07.515 --> 00:01:09.967
we order the same tests,

00:01:09.991 --> 00:01:12.125
we prescribe the same medication,

00:01:12.149 --> 00:01:16.551
without ever thinking about the sex
or gender of our patients.

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:18.774
Why would we?

00:01:19.203 --> 00:01:22.944
We were never taught that there were
any differences between men and women.

00:01:22.968 --> 00:01:27.527
A recent Government Accountability study
revealed that 80 percent of the drugs

00:01:27.551 --> 00:01:29.702
withdrawn from the market

00:01:29.726 --> 00:01:32.119
are due to side effects on women.

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:35.541
So let's think about that for a minute.

00:01:35.565 --> 00:01:39.439
Why are we discovering
side effects on women

00:01:39.463 --> 00:01:42.749
only after a drug has been
released to the market?

00:01:43.646 --> 00:01:49.306
Do you know that it takes years
for a drug to go from an idea

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:52.487
to being tested on cells in a laboratory,

00:01:52.511 --> 00:01:54.479
to animal studies,

00:01:54.503 --> 00:01:56.630
to then clinical trials on humans,

00:01:56.654 --> 00:02:00.525
finally to go through
a regulatory approval process,

00:02:00.549 --> 00:02:04.885
to be available for your doctor
to prescribe to you?

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:09.690
Not to mention the millions and billions
of dollars of funding

00:02:09.714 --> 00:02:12.096
it takes to go through that process.

00:02:13.747 --> 00:02:16.699
So why are we discovering
unacceptable side effects

00:02:16.723 --> 00:02:21.174
on half the population
after that has gone through?

00:02:23.313 --> 00:02:24.577
What's happening?

00:02:24.927 --> 00:02:29.031
Well, it turns out that those cells
used in that laboratory,

00:02:29.055 --> 00:02:30.985
they're male cells,

00:02:31.009 --> 00:02:34.411
and the animals used
in the animal studies were male animals,

00:02:34.435 --> 00:02:39.525
and the clinical trials have been
performed almost exclusively on men.

00:02:41.326 --> 00:02:46.680
How is it that the male model became
our framework for medical research?

00:02:46.704 --> 00:02:50.775
Let's look at an example that has been
popularized in the media,

00:02:50.799 --> 00:02:54.005
and it has to do
with the sleep aid Ambien.

00:02:54.029 --> 00:02:58.793
Ambien was released on the market
over 20 years ago,

00:02:58.817 --> 00:03:03.630
and since then, hundreds of millions
of prescriptions have been written,

00:03:03.654 --> 00:03:08.102
primarily to women, because women
suffer more sleep disorders than men.

00:03:09.197 --> 00:03:11.373
But just this past year,

00:03:11.397 --> 00:03:14.821
the Food and Drug Administration
recommended cutting the dose in half

00:03:14.845 --> 00:03:17.732
for women only,

00:03:17.756 --> 00:03:20.593
because they just realized
that women metabolize the drug

00:03:20.617 --> 00:03:23.530
at a slower rate than men,

00:03:23.554 --> 00:03:25.593
causing them to wake up in the morning

00:03:25.617 --> 00:03:28.811
with more of the active drug
in their system.

00:03:28.835 --> 00:03:32.765
And then they're drowsy and they're
getting behind the wheel of the car,

00:03:32.789 --> 00:03:35.756
and they're at risk
for motor vehicle accidents.

00:03:37.105 --> 00:03:41.049
And I can't help but think,
as an emergency physician,

00:03:41.073 --> 00:03:45.866
how many of my patients
that I've cared for over the years

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:48.696
were involved in a motor vehicle accident

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:52.172
that possibly could have been prevented

00:03:52.196 --> 00:03:57.311
if this type of analysis was performed
and acted upon 20 years ago

00:03:57.335 --> 00:03:59.343
when this drug was first released.

00:04:01.239 --> 00:04:04.434
How many other things need
to be analyzed by gender?

00:04:05.347 --> 00:04:07.029
What else are we missing?

00:04:09.705 --> 00:04:13.381
World War II changed a lot of things,

00:04:13.405 --> 00:04:16.286
and one of them was this need
to protect people

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:20.650
from becoming victims of medical research
without informed consent.

00:04:21.617 --> 00:04:25.293
So some much-needed guidelines
or rules were set into place,

00:04:25.317 --> 00:04:30.339
and part of that was this desire
to protect women of childbearing age

00:04:30.363 --> 00:04:33.314
from entering into any
medical research studies.

00:04:34.166 --> 00:04:38.729
There was fear: what if something
happened to the fetus during the study?

00:04:39.516 --> 00:04:41.065
Who would be responsible?

00:04:42.149 --> 00:04:44.638
And so the scientists
at this time actually thought

00:04:44.662 --> 00:04:47.278
this was a blessing in disguise,

00:04:47.302 --> 00:04:52.515
because let's face it -- men's bodies
are pretty homogeneous.

00:04:53.017 --> 00:04:56.463
They don't have the constantly
fluctuating levels of hormones

00:04:56.487 --> 00:05:00.231
that could disrupt clean data
they could get if they had only men.

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:04.070
It was easier. It was cheaper.

00:05:05.801 --> 00:05:08.634
Not to mention, at this time,
there was a general assumption

00:05:08.658 --> 00:05:12.883
that men and women
were alike in every way,

00:05:12.907 --> 00:05:16.350
apart from their reproductive organs
and sex hormones.

00:05:17.361 --> 00:05:20.178
So it was decided:

00:05:21.267 --> 00:05:24.783
medical research was performed on men,

00:05:24.807 --> 00:05:27.564
and the results were later
applied to women.

00:05:29.353 --> 00:05:32.894
What did this do to the notion
of women's health?

00:05:32.918 --> 00:05:37.174
Women's health became synonymous
with reproduction:

00:05:37.198 --> 00:05:41.743
breasts, ovaries, uterus, pregnancy.

00:05:42.505 --> 00:05:45.537
It's this term we now refer
to as "bikini medicine."

00:05:46.611 --> 00:05:49.255
And this stayed this way
until about the 1980s,

00:05:49.279 --> 00:05:52.764
when this concept was challenged
by the medical community

00:05:52.788 --> 00:05:56.929
and by the public health policymakers
when they realized that

00:05:56.953 --> 00:06:01.256
by excluding women
from all medical research studies

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:04.769
we actually did them a disservice,

00:06:04.793 --> 00:06:07.125
in that apart from reproductive issues,

00:06:07.149 --> 00:06:09.713
virtually nothing was known
about the unique needs

00:06:09.737 --> 00:06:11.455
of the female patient.

00:06:13.149 --> 00:06:18.663
Since that time, an overwhelming amount
of evidence has come to light

00:06:18.687 --> 00:06:24.198
that shows us just how different
men and women are in every way.

00:06:29.447 --> 00:06:32.200
You know, we have this saying in medicine:

00:06:32.224 --> 00:06:35.172
children are not just little adults.

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:38.897
And we say that to remind ourselves

00:06:38.921 --> 00:06:43.598
that children actually have
a different physiology than normal adults.

00:06:44.828 --> 00:06:49.785
And it's because of this that the medical
specialty of pediatrics came to light.

00:06:49.809 --> 00:06:56.055
And we now conduct research on children
in order to improve their lives.

00:06:57.189 --> 00:07:00.086
And I know the same thing
can be said about women.

00:07:00.110 --> 00:07:05.171
Women are not just men
with boobs and tubes.

00:07:06.711 --> 00:07:10.267
But they have their own
anatomy and physiology

00:07:10.291 --> 00:07:13.821
that deserves to be studied
with the same intensity.

00:07:15.531 --> 00:07:18.462
Let's take the cardiovascular
system, for example.

00:07:19.149 --> 00:07:22.856
This area in medicine has done the most
to try to figure out

00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:27.029
why it seems men and women have
completely different heart attacks.

00:07:28.149 --> 00:07:33.239
Heart disease is the number one killer
for both men and women,

00:07:33.263 --> 00:07:37.699
but more women die within the first year
of having a heart attack than men.

00:07:39.199 --> 00:07:43.213
Men will complain
of crushing chest pain --

00:07:43.237 --> 00:07:45.719
an elephant is sitting on their chest.

00:07:46.605 --> 00:07:48.145
And we call this typical.

00:07:49.772 --> 00:07:52.862
Women have chest pain, too.

00:07:52.886 --> 00:07:59.583
But more women than men
will complain of "just not feeling right,"

00:08:01.048 --> 00:08:03.917
"can't seem to get enough air in,"

00:08:03.941 --> 00:08:05.915
"just so tired lately."

00:08:07.150 --> 00:08:10.053
And for some reason we call this atypical,

00:08:10.077 --> 00:08:14.004
even though, as I mentioned,
women do make up half the population.

00:08:15.687 --> 00:08:21.458
And so what is some of the evidence
to help explain some of these differences?

00:08:22.149 --> 00:08:24.680
If we look at the anatomy,

00:08:24.704 --> 00:08:30.719
the blood vessels that surround the heart
are smaller in women compared to men,

00:08:30.743 --> 00:08:35.223
and the way that those blood vessels
develop disease is different

00:08:35.247 --> 00:08:37.302
in women compared to men.

00:08:38.025 --> 00:08:43.177
And the test that we use to determine
if someone is at risk for a heart attack,

00:08:43.201 --> 00:08:47.773
well, they were initially designed
and tested and perfected in men,

00:08:47.797 --> 00:08:50.931
and so aren't as good
at determining that in women.

00:08:52.455 --> 00:08:55.392
And then if we think
about the medications --

00:08:55.416 --> 00:08:58.663
common medications
that we use, like aspirin.

00:08:59.917 --> 00:09:04.444
We give aspirin to healthy men to help
prevent them from having a heart attack,

00:09:04.468 --> 00:09:08.702
but do you know that if you
give aspirin to a healthy woman,

00:09:08.726 --> 00:09:10.312
it's actually harmful?

00:09:12.526 --> 00:09:14.908
What this is doing is merely telling us

00:09:14.932 --> 00:09:17.684
that we are scratching the surface.

00:09:19.295 --> 00:09:22.721
Emergency medicine
is a fast-paced business.

00:09:23.713 --> 00:09:27.066
In how many life-saving areas of medicine,

00:09:27.090 --> 00:09:31.066
like cancer and stroke,

00:09:31.090 --> 00:09:35.223
are there important differences between
men and women that we could be utilizing?

00:09:36.402 --> 00:09:41.206
Or even, why is it that some people
get those runny noses

00:09:41.230 --> 00:09:43.415
more than others,

00:09:43.439 --> 00:09:46.766
or why the pain medication that we give
to those stubbed toes

00:09:46.790 --> 00:09:49.995
work in some and not in others?

00:09:53.438 --> 00:09:58.668
The Institute of Medicine has said
every cell has a sex.

00:09:59.970 --> 00:10:01.383
What does this mean?

00:10:02.682 --> 00:10:05.080
Sex is DNA.

00:10:05.104 --> 00:10:09.445
Gender is how someone
presents themselves in society.

00:10:10.033 --> 00:10:12.573
And these two may not always match up,

00:10:12.597 --> 00:10:15.763
as we can see with our
transgendered population.

00:10:16.890 --> 00:10:21.805
But it's important to realize
that from the moment of conception,

00:10:21.829 --> 00:10:23.951
every cell in our bodies --

00:10:23.975 --> 00:10:27.276
skin, hair, heart and lungs --

00:10:27.300 --> 00:10:30.587
contains our own unique DNA,

00:10:30.611 --> 00:10:34.362
and that DNA contains
the chromosomes that determine

00:10:34.386 --> 00:10:39.447
whether we become
male or female, man or woman.

00:10:40.550 --> 00:10:42.138
It used to be thought

00:10:42.162 --> 00:10:46.490
that those sex-determining
chromosomes pictured here --

00:10:46.514 --> 00:10:49.887
XY if you're male, XX if you're female --

00:10:49.911 --> 00:10:55.125
merely determined whether you
would be born with ovaries or testes,

00:10:55.149 --> 00:10:58.890
and it was the sex hormones
that those organs produced

00:10:58.914 --> 00:11:03.479
that were responsible for the differences
we see in the opposite sex.

00:11:04.907 --> 00:11:09.741
But we now know that
that theory was wrong --

00:11:09.765 --> 00:11:12.210
or it's at least a little incomplete.

00:11:12.234 --> 00:11:17.012
And thankfully, scientists like Dr. Page
from the Whitehead Institute,

00:11:17.036 --> 00:11:19.010
who works on the Y chromosome,

00:11:19.034 --> 00:11:21.201
and Doctor Yang from UCLA,

00:11:21.225 --> 00:11:26.884
they have found evidence that tells us
that those sex-determining chromosomes

00:11:26.908 --> 00:11:29.505
that are in every cell in our bodies

00:11:29.529 --> 00:11:34.888
continue to remain active
for our entire lives

00:11:36.667 --> 00:11:40.242
and could be what's responsible
for the differences we see

00:11:40.266 --> 00:11:42.481
in the dosing of drugs,

00:11:42.505 --> 00:11:45.471
or why there are differences
between men and women

00:11:45.495 --> 00:11:49.011
in the susceptibility
and severity of diseases.

00:11:51.182 --> 00:11:54.102
This new knowledge is the game-changer,

00:11:57.575 --> 00:12:00.949
and it's up to those scientists
that continue to find that evidence,

00:12:00.973 --> 00:12:05.126
but it's up to the clinicians
to start translating this data

00:12:05.150 --> 00:12:08.149
at the bedside, today.

00:12:09.318 --> 00:12:10.474
Right now.

00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:16.624
And to help do this, I'm a co-founder
of a national organization

00:12:16.648 --> 00:12:19.631
called Sex and Gender
Women's Health Collaborative,

00:12:19.655 --> 00:12:24.275
and we collect all of this data
so that it's available for teaching

00:12:24.299 --> 00:12:25.704
and for patient care.

00:12:26.530 --> 00:12:30.898
And we're working to bring together
the medical educators to the table.

00:12:31.906 --> 00:12:33.374
That's a big job.

00:12:34.312 --> 00:12:39.451
It's changing the way medical training
has been done since its inception.

00:12:41.189 --> 00:12:43.032
But I believe in them.

00:12:44.032 --> 00:12:49.629
I know they're going to see the value
of incorporating the gender lens

00:12:49.653 --> 00:12:51.375
into the current curriculum.

00:12:52.748 --> 00:12:57.366
It's about training the future
health care providers correctly.

00:13:00.587 --> 00:13:01.738
And regionally,

00:13:01.762 --> 00:13:05.623
I'm a co-creator of a division within
the Department of Emergency Medicine

00:13:05.647 --> 00:13:07.367
here at Brown University,

00:13:07.391 --> 00:13:10.001
called Sex and Gender
in Emergency Medicine,

00:13:10.025 --> 00:13:14.651
and we conduct the research to determine
the differences between men and women

00:13:14.675 --> 00:13:16.833
in emergent conditions,

00:13:16.857 --> 00:13:22.125
like heart disease and stroke
and sepsis and substance abuse,

00:13:22.149 --> 00:13:26.526
but we also believe
that education is paramount.

00:13:27.454 --> 00:13:31.455
We've created a 360-degree
model of education.

00:13:31.479 --> 00:13:37.437
We have programs for the doctors,
for the nurses, for the students

00:13:37.461 --> 00:13:39.167
and for the patients.

00:13:39.661 --> 00:13:43.719
Because this cannot just be left up
to the health care leaders.

00:13:44.465 --> 00:13:47.942
We all have a role in making a difference.

00:13:48.800 --> 00:13:52.657
But I must warn you: this is not easy.

00:13:53.990 --> 00:13:55.582
In fact, it's hard.

00:13:57.296 --> 00:14:01.688
It's essentially changing the way
we think about medicine

00:14:01.712 --> 00:14:04.709
and health and research.

00:14:05.861 --> 00:14:08.997
It's changing our relationship
to the health care system.

00:14:09.910 --> 00:14:12.798
But there's no going back.

00:14:13.489 --> 00:14:17.188
We now know just enough

00:14:17.212 --> 00:14:19.568
to know that we weren't doing it right.

00:14:21.822 --> 00:14:24.140
Martin Luther King, Jr. has said,

00:14:24.164 --> 00:14:28.813
"Change does not roll in
on the wheels of inevitability,

00:14:28.837 --> 00:14:31.011
but comes through continuous struggle."

00:14:32.464 --> 00:14:35.194
And the first step
towards change is awareness.

00:14:36.266 --> 00:14:40.344
This is not just about improving
medical care for women.

00:14:40.852 --> 00:14:45.811
This is about personalized,
individualized health care for everyone.

00:14:47.240 --> 00:14:53.342
This awareness has the power to transform
medical care for men and women.

00:14:54.977 --> 00:15:00.665
And from now on, I want you
to ask your doctors

00:15:00.689 --> 00:15:04.966
whether the treatments you are receiving
are specific to your sex and gender.

00:15:06.396 --> 00:15:09.085
They may not know the answer --

00:15:09.109 --> 00:15:10.275
yet.

00:15:11.251 --> 00:15:15.113
But the conversation has begun,
and together we can all learn.

00:15:15.947 --> 00:15:20.324
Remember, for me
and my colleagues in this field,

00:15:20.348 --> 00:15:22.625
your sex and gender matter.

00:15:23.529 --> 00:15:24.681
Thank you.

00:15:24.705 --> 00:15:29.149
(Applause)
