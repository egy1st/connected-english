00:00:12.729 --> 00:00:16.174
I would like to demonstrate
for the first time in public

00:00:16.198 --> 00:00:20.269
that it is possible to transmit a video

00:00:20.293 --> 00:00:24.602
from a standard off-the-shelf LED lamp

00:00:24.626 --> 00:00:29.786
to a solar cell with a laptop
acting as a receiver.

00:00:30.628 --> 00:00:33.219
There is no Wi-Fi involved,
it's just light.

00:00:33.243 --> 00:00:36.077
And you may wonder, what's the point?

00:00:36.101 --> 00:00:37.845
And the point is this:

00:00:38.549 --> 00:00:41.225
There will be a massive
extension of the Internet

00:00:41.249 --> 00:00:44.059
to close the digital divide,

00:00:44.083 --> 00:00:48.264
and also to allow for what we call
"The Internet of Things" --

00:00:48.288 --> 00:00:51.454
tens of billions of devices
connected to the Internet.

00:00:51.478 --> 00:00:55.509
In my view, such an extension
of the Internet can only work

00:00:55.533 --> 00:00:57.880
if it's almost energy-neutral.

00:00:58.323 --> 00:01:03.155
This means we need to use existing
infrastructure as much as possible.

00:01:03.647 --> 00:01:08.584
And this is where the solar cell
and the LED come in.

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:11.427
I demonstrated for the first time,

00:01:11.451 --> 00:01:13.416
at TED in 2011,

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:15.424
Li-Fi, or Light Fidelity.

00:01:15.931 --> 00:01:21.926
Li-Fi uses off-the-shelf LEDs
to transmit data incredibly fast,

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:24.242
and also in a safe and secure manner.

00:01:25.552 --> 00:01:28.433
Data is transported by the light,

00:01:28.457 --> 00:01:31.582
encoded in subtle changes
of the brightness.

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:36.104
If we look around,
we have many LEDs around us,

00:01:36.128 --> 00:01:40.789
so there's a rich infrastructure
of Li-Fi transmitters around us.

00:01:41.543 --> 00:01:46.782
But so far, we have been using
special devices -- small photo detectors,

00:01:46.806 --> 00:01:50.488
to receive the information
encoded in the data.

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.982
I wanted to find a way to also use
existing infrastructure

00:01:55.006 --> 00:01:58.012
to receive data from our Li-Fi lights.

00:01:58.576 --> 00:02:02.690
And this is why I have been looking into
solar cells and solar panels.

00:02:03.166 --> 00:02:08.294
A solar cell absorbs light
and converts it into electrical energy.

00:02:08.699 --> 00:02:13.685
This is why we can use a solar cell
to charge our mobile phone.

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:15.115
But now we need to remember

00:02:15.139 --> 00:02:21.370
that the data is encoded in subtle changes
of the brightness of the LED,

00:02:21.394 --> 00:02:24.743
so if the incoming light fluctuates,

00:02:24.767 --> 00:02:27.698
so does the energy harvested
from the solar cell.

00:02:28.729 --> 00:02:32.238
This means we have
a principal mechanism in place

00:02:32.262 --> 00:02:38.372
to receive information from the light
and by the solar cell,

00:02:38.396 --> 00:02:41.171
because the fluctuations
of the energy harvested

00:02:41.195 --> 00:02:43.313
correspond to the data transmitted.

00:02:44.084 --> 00:02:46.210
Of course the question is:

00:02:46.234 --> 00:02:50.394
can we receive very fast and subtle
changes of the brightness,

00:02:50.418 --> 00:02:54.228
such as the ones transmitted
by our LED lights?

00:02:54.791 --> 00:02:58.295
And the answer to that is yes, we can.

00:02:58.787 --> 00:03:00.566
We have shown in the lab

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:04.072
that we can receive up to 50
megabytes per second

00:03:04.096 --> 00:03:06.531
from a standard, off-the-shelf solar cell.

00:03:07.071 --> 00:03:10.698
And this is faster than most
broadband connections these days.

00:03:11.587 --> 00:03:14.897
Now let me show you in practice.

00:03:17.245 --> 00:03:21.633
In this box is a standard,
off-the-shelf LED lamp.

00:03:23.343 --> 00:03:25.918
This is a standard,
off-the-shelf solar cell;

00:03:25.942 --> 00:03:28.125
it is connected to the laptop.

00:03:29.099 --> 00:03:31.419
And also we have an instrument here

00:03:31.443 --> 00:03:35.221
to visualize the energy
we harvest from the solar cell.

00:03:35.245 --> 00:03:38.043
And this instrument shows
something at the moment.

00:03:38.067 --> 00:03:42.348
This is because the solar cell already
harvests light from the ambient light.

00:03:43.252 --> 00:03:46.092
Now what I would like to do first
is switch on the light,

00:03:46.116 --> 00:03:48.222
and I'll simply, only switch on the light,

00:03:48.246 --> 00:03:50.354
for a moment,

00:03:50.378 --> 00:03:54.372
and what you'll notice is that
the instrument jumps to the right.

00:03:55.054 --> 00:03:56.744
So the solar cell, for a moment,

00:03:56.768 --> 00:04:00.290
is harvesting energy
from this artificial light source.

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:03.968
If I turn it off, we see it drops.

00:04:03.992 --> 00:04:05.175
I turn it on ...

00:04:05.199 --> 00:04:07.918
So we harvest energy with the solar cell.

00:04:08.736 --> 00:04:14.059
But next I would like to activate
the streaming of the video.

00:04:15.568 --> 00:04:17.892
And I've done this
by pressing this button.

00:04:17.916 --> 00:04:22.639
So now this LED lamp here
is streaming a video

00:04:22.663 --> 00:04:26.795
by changing the brightness of the LED
in a very subtle way,

00:04:26.819 --> 00:04:29.317
and in a way that you can't
recognize with your eye,

00:04:29.341 --> 00:04:32.597
because the changes
are too fast to recognize.

00:04:33.534 --> 00:04:35.933
But in order to prove the point,

00:04:35.957 --> 00:04:39.102
I can block the light of the solar cell.

00:04:40.237 --> 00:04:43.460
So first you notice
the energy harvesting drops

00:04:43.484 --> 00:04:45.176
and the video stops as well.

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:48.856
If I remove the blockage,
the video will restart.

00:04:49.507 --> 00:04:55.736
(Applause)

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:58.093
And I can repeat that.

00:04:58.117 --> 00:05:03.368
So we stop the transmission of the video
and energy harvesting stops as well.

00:05:03.392 --> 00:05:07.800
So that is to show that the solar cell
acts as a receiver.

00:05:08.229 --> 00:05:13.613
But now imagine that this LED lamp
is a street light, and there's fog.

00:05:14.256 --> 00:05:16.559
And so I want to simulate fog,

00:05:16.583 --> 00:05:19.326
and that's why I brought
a handkerchief with me.

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:20.782
(Laughter)

00:05:20.806 --> 00:05:24.766
And let me put the handkerchief
over the solar cell.

00:05:26.055 --> 00:05:27.683
First you notice

00:05:27.707 --> 00:05:31.904
the energy harvested drops, as expected,

00:05:31.928 --> 00:05:34.506
but now the video still continues.

00:05:34.919 --> 00:05:37.538
This means, despite the blockage,

00:05:37.562 --> 00:05:41.443
there's sufficient light coming through
the handkerchief to the solar cell,

00:05:41.467 --> 00:05:46.982
so that the solar cell is able to decode
and stream that information,

00:05:47.006 --> 00:05:49.610
in this case, a high-definition video.

00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:56.753
What's really important here is that
a solar cell has become a receiver

00:05:56.777 --> 00:06:00.592
for high-speed wireless signals
encoded in light,

00:06:00.616 --> 00:06:05.432
while it maintains its primary function
as an energy-harvesting device.

00:06:06.022 --> 00:06:08.441
That's why it is possible

00:06:08.465 --> 00:06:12.322
to use existing solar cells
on the roof of a hut

00:06:12.346 --> 00:06:14.839
to act as a broadband receiver

00:06:14.863 --> 00:06:19.239
from a laser station on a close by hill,
or indeed, lamp post.

00:06:19.755 --> 00:06:23.450
And It really doesn't matter
where the beam hits the solar cell.

00:06:23.797 --> 00:06:24.975
And the same is true

00:06:24.999 --> 00:06:28.792
for translucent solar cells
integrated into windows,

00:06:28.816 --> 00:06:32.348
solar cells integrated
into street furniture,

00:06:32.372 --> 00:06:36.915
or indeed, solar cells integrated
into these billions of devices

00:06:36.939 --> 00:06:39.015
that will form the Internet of Things.

00:06:39.039 --> 00:06:40.197
Because simply,

00:06:40.221 --> 00:06:42.712
we don't want to charge
these devices regularly,

00:06:42.736 --> 00:06:45.711
or worse, replace the batteries
every few months.

00:06:46.568 --> 00:06:48.298
As I said to you,

00:06:48.322 --> 00:06:50.640
this is the first time
I've shown this in public.

00:06:50.664 --> 00:06:52.719
It's very much a lab demonstration,

00:06:52.743 --> 00:06:53.946
a prototype.

00:06:54.426 --> 00:06:57.720
But my team and I are confident
that we can take this to market

00:06:57.744 --> 00:06:59.735
within the next two to three years.

00:07:00.401 --> 00:07:05.694
And we hope we will be able to contribute
to closing the digital divide,

00:07:05.718 --> 00:07:06.916
and also contribute

00:07:06.940 --> 00:07:09.885
to connecting all these billions
of devices to the Internet.

00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:12.045
And all of this without causing

00:07:12.069 --> 00:07:14.521
a massive explosion
of energy consumption --

00:07:14.545 --> 00:07:16.767
because of the solar cells,
quite the opposite.

00:07:16.791 --> 00:07:17.944
Thank you.

00:07:17.968 --> 00:07:23.150
(Applause)
