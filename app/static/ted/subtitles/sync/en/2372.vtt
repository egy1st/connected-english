00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:15.766
Religion is more than belief.

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:18.606
It's power, and it's influence.

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:21.246
And that influence affects all of us,

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:25.126
every day, regardless of your own belief.

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:29.206
Despite the enormous influence
of religion on the world today,

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:33.006
we hold them to a different standard
of scrutiny and accountability

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.086
than any other sector of our society.

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:40.526
For example, if there were
a multinational organization,

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:43.606
government or corporation today

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:47.886
that said no female
could be on a leadership board,

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:52.006
not one woman could have
a decision-making authority,

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:55.886
not one woman could handle
any financial matter,

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:57.286
we would have outrage.

00:00:57.310 --> 00:00:58.966
There would be sanctions.

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:04.526
And yet this is a common practice
in almost every world religion today.

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:06.966
We accept things in our religious lives

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:10.086
that we do not accept
in our secular lives,

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:14.166
and I know this because I've been
doing it for three decades.

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:18.686
I was the type of girl that fought every
form of gender discrimination growing up.

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:22.726
I played pickup basketball games
with the boys and inserted myself.

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:26.186
I said I was going to be the first
female President of the United States.

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:28.646
I have been fighting
for the Equal Rights Amendment,

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:31.126
which has been dead for 40 years.

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:34.286
I'm the first woman
in both sides of my family

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:38.486
to ever work outside the home
and ever receive a higher education.

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:43.326
I never accepted being excluded
because I was a woman,

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.526
except in my religion.

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:46.926
Throughout all of that time,

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:51.246
I was a part of a very patriarchal
orthodox Mormon religion.

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.046
I grew up in an enormously
traditional family.

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:56.206
I have eight siblings,
a stay-at-home mother.

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:59.430
My father's actually
a religious leader in the community.

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:05.166
And I grew up in a world believing
that my worth and my standing

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:09.246
was in keeping these rules
that I'd known my whole life.

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:12.086
You get married a virgin,
you never drink alcohol,

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:14.486
you don't smoke, you always do service,

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:16.486
you're a good kid.

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:20.086
Some of the rules we had were strict,

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:22.726
but you followed the rules
because you loved the people

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:25.406
and you loved the religion
and you believed.

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:28.246
Everything about Mormonism
determined what you wore,

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:29.776
who you dated, who you married.

00:02:29.801 --> 00:02:32.150
It determined what underwear we wore.

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:36.246
I was the kind of religious
where everyone I know

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:39.646
donated 10 percent of everything
they earned to the church,

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:40.886
including myself.

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:44.846
From paper routes and babysitting,
I donated 10 percent.

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:47.926
I was the kind of religious
where I heard parents tell children

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:51.566
when they're leaving
on a two-year proselytizing mission

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:54.126
that they would rather have them die

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:57.366
than return home
without honor, having sinned.

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:59.846
I was the type and the kind of religious

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:03.326
where kids kill themselves
every single year

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:07.686
because they're terrified
of coming out to our community as gay.

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:09.726
But I was also the kind of religious

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:12.286
where it didn't matter
where in the world I lived,

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:16.086
I had friendship,
instantaneous mutual aid.

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:20.326
This was where I felt safe.
This is certainty and clarity about life.

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:22.606
I had help raising my little daughter.

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:27.526
So that's why I accepted without question
that only men can lead,

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:29.686
and I accepted without question

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:32.846
that women can't have the spiritual
authority of God on the Earth,

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:34.286
which we call the priesthood.

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:38.806
And I allowed discrepancies between
men and women in operating budgets,

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:42.206
disciplinary councils,
in decision-making capacities,

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:45.366
and I gave my religion a free pass

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:47.246
because I loved it.

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:49.246
Until I stopped,

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:52.886
and I realized that I had
been allowing myself to be treated

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:57.806
as the support staff
to the real work of men.

00:03:57.830 --> 00:04:00.206
And I faced this contradiction in myself,

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:02.966
and I joined with other activists
in my community.

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:07.366
We've been working very, very, very hard
for the last decade and more.

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:09.604
The first thing we did
was raise consciousness.

00:04:09.628 --> 00:04:12.126
You can't change what you can't see.

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:15.366
We started podcasting,
blogging, writing articles.

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:17.926
I created lists of hundreds of ways

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:20.966
that men and women
are unequal in our community.

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:24.486
The next thing we did
was build advocacy organizations.

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:28.446
We tried to do things
that were unignorable,

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:33.926
like wearing pants to church
and trying to attend all-male meetings.

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:36.446
These seem like simple things,

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:40.686
but to us, the organizers,
they were enormously costly.

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:43.966
We lost relationships. We lost jobs.

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:46.046
We got hate mail on a daily basis.

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:49.406
We were attacked in social media
and national press.

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:51.126
We received death threats.

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:55.366
We lost standing in our community.
Some of us got excommunicated.

00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:58.286
Most of us got put
in front of a disciplinary council,

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:01.446
and were rejected
from the communities that we loved

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:05.470
because we wanted to make them better,
because we believed that they could be.

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:09.886
And I began to expect this reaction
from my own people.

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:13.846
I know what it feels like when you feel
like someone's trying to change you

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:15.886
or criticize you.

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:20.046
But what utterly shocked me
was throughout all of this work

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:24.270
I received equal measures of vitriol
from the secular left,

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:29.246
the same vehemence as the religious right.

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:33.126
And what my secular friends didn't realize
was that this religious hostility,

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:37.286
these phrases of, "Oh, all religious
people are crazy or stupid."

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:39.366
"Don't pay attention to religion."

00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:42.726
"They're going to be
homophobic and sexist."

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:44.806
What they didn't understand

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:49.390
was that that type of hostility
did not fight religious extremism,

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:52.766
it bred religious extremism.

00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:56.206
Those arguments don't work,
and I know because I remember

00:05:56.230 --> 00:06:00.270
someone telling me
that I was stupid for being Mormon.

00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:05.806
And what it caused me to do
was defend myself and my people

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:09.310
and everything we believe in,
because we're not stupid.

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:15.646
So criticism and hostility doesn't work,
and I didn't listen to these arguments.

00:06:15.670 --> 00:06:18.366
When I hear these arguments,
I still continue to bristle,

00:06:18.390 --> 00:06:20.046
because I have family and friends.

00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:22.766
These are my people,
and I'm the first to defend them,

00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:24.806
but the struggle is real.

00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:28.606
How do we respect
someone's religious beliefs

00:06:28.630 --> 00:06:31.926
while still holding them accountable
for the harm or damage

00:06:31.950 --> 00:06:34.246
that those beliefs may cause others?

00:06:34.270 --> 00:06:37.046
It's a tough question.
I still don't have a perfect answer.

00:06:37.070 --> 00:06:41.206
My parents and I have been walking
on this tightrope for the last decade.

00:06:41.230 --> 00:06:43.966
They're intelligent people.
They're lovely people.

00:06:43.990 --> 00:06:47.886
And let me try to help you
understand their perspective.

00:06:47.910 --> 00:06:50.886
In Mormonism, we believe
that after you die,

00:06:50.910 --> 00:06:54.246
if you keep all the rules
and you follow all the rituals,

00:06:54.270 --> 00:06:57.366
you can be together as a family again.

00:06:57.390 --> 00:06:59.806
And to my parents,
me doing something as simple

00:06:59.830 --> 00:07:03.206
as having a sleeveless top right now,
showing my shoulders,

00:07:03.230 --> 00:07:05.006
that makes me unworthy.

00:07:05.030 --> 00:07:08.366
I won't be with my family
in the eternities.

00:07:08.390 --> 00:07:12.566
But even more, I had a brother
die in a tragic accident at 15,

00:07:12.590 --> 00:07:16.846
and something as simple as this
means we won't be together as a family.

00:07:16.870 --> 00:07:20.446
And to my parents, they cannot understand

00:07:20.470 --> 00:07:23.566
why something as simple
as fashion or women's rights

00:07:23.590 --> 00:07:26.286
would prevent me
from seeing my brother again.

00:07:26.310 --> 00:07:29.046
And that's the mindset
that we're dealing with,

00:07:29.070 --> 00:07:32.166
and criticism does not change that.

00:07:32.190 --> 00:07:34.886
And so my parents and I
have been walking this tightrope,

00:07:34.910 --> 00:07:37.846
explaining our sides,
respecting one another,

00:07:37.870 --> 00:07:41.846
but actually invalidating
each other's very basic beliefs

00:07:41.870 --> 00:07:45.206
by the way we live our lives,
and it's been difficult.

00:07:45.230 --> 00:07:47.686
The way that we've been able to do that

00:07:47.710 --> 00:07:50.126
is to get past those defensive shells

00:07:50.150 --> 00:07:54.166
and really see the soft inside
of unbelief and belief

00:07:54.190 --> 00:07:58.806
and try to respect each other
while still holding boundaries clear.

00:07:58.830 --> 00:08:03.286
The other thing that the secular left
and the atheists and the orthodox

00:08:03.310 --> 00:08:07.326
and the religious right,
what they all don't understand

00:08:07.350 --> 00:08:10.206
was why even care
about religious activism?

00:08:10.230 --> 00:08:13.286
I cannot tell you the hundreds
of people who have said,

00:08:13.310 --> 00:08:15.926
"If you don't like religion, just leave."

00:08:15.950 --> 00:08:17.830
Why would you try to change it?

00:08:19.030 --> 00:08:21.467
Because what is taught on the Sabbath

00:08:21.492 --> 00:08:24.526
leaks into our politics,
our health policy,

00:08:24.550 --> 00:08:26.406
violence around the world.

00:08:26.430 --> 00:08:30.126
It leaks into education,
military, fiscal decision-making.

00:08:30.150 --> 00:08:33.446
These laws get legally
and culturally codified.

00:08:33.470 --> 00:08:38.406
In fact, my own religion has had
an enormous effect on this nation.

00:08:38.430 --> 00:08:43.006
For example, during Prop 8,
my church raised over 22 million dollars

00:08:43.030 --> 00:08:46.309
to fight same-sex marriage in California.

00:08:46.990 --> 00:08:51.206
Forty years ago,
political historians will say,

00:08:51.230 --> 00:08:55.086
that if it wasn't for the Mormon
opposition to the Equal Rights Amendment,

00:08:55.110 --> 00:08:58.926
we'd have an Equal Rights Amendment
in our Constitution today.

00:08:58.950 --> 00:09:02.110
How many lives did that affect?

00:09:02.950 --> 00:09:05.726
And we can spend time
fighting every single one

00:09:05.750 --> 00:09:08.886
of these little tiny laws and rules,

00:09:08.910 --> 00:09:10.486
or we can ask ourselves,

00:09:10.510 --> 00:09:16.686
why is gender inequality
the default around the world?

00:09:16.710 --> 00:09:19.366
Why is that the assumption?

00:09:19.390 --> 00:09:25.326
Because religion doesn't just
create the roots of morality,

00:09:25.350 --> 00:09:29.406
it creates the seeds of normality.

00:09:29.430 --> 00:09:32.766
Religions can liberate or subjugate,

00:09:32.790 --> 00:09:36.006
they can empower or exploit,
they can comfort or destroy,

00:09:36.030 --> 00:09:40.566
and the people that tip the scales
over to the ethical and the moral

00:09:40.590 --> 00:09:43.726
are often not those in charge.

00:09:43.750 --> 00:09:46.646
Religions can't be dismissed or ignored.

00:09:46.670 --> 00:09:49.566
We need to take them seriously.

00:09:49.590 --> 00:09:54.126
But it's not easy to influence a religion,
like we just talked about.

00:09:54.150 --> 00:09:56.366
But I'll tell you
what my people have done.

00:09:56.390 --> 00:09:58.486
My groups are small,
there's hundreds of us,

00:09:58.510 --> 00:10:00.886
but we've had huge impact.

00:10:00.910 --> 00:10:03.926
Right now, women's pictures
are hanging in the halls next to men

00:10:03.950 --> 00:10:05.166
for the first time.

00:10:05.190 --> 00:10:07.926
Women are now allowed
to pray in our church-wide meetings,

00:10:07.950 --> 00:10:10.966
and they never were before
in the general conferences.

00:10:10.990 --> 00:10:13.526
As of last week, in a historic move,

00:10:13.550 --> 00:10:16.726
three women were invited
down to three leadership boards

00:10:16.750 --> 00:10:18.726
that oversee the entire church.

00:10:18.750 --> 00:10:21.566
We've seen perceptual shifts
in the Mormon community

00:10:21.590 --> 00:10:24.086
that allow for talk of gender inequality.

00:10:24.110 --> 00:10:27.486
We've opened up space,
regardless of being despised,

00:10:27.510 --> 00:10:31.406
for more conservative women
to step in and make real changes,

00:10:31.430 --> 00:10:36.286
and the words "women" and "the priesthood"
can now be uttered in the same sentence.

00:10:36.310 --> 00:10:38.926
I never had that.

00:10:38.950 --> 00:10:43.526
My daughter and my nieces are inheriting
a religion that I never had,

00:10:43.550 --> 00:10:46.310
that's more equal -- we've had an effect.

00:10:47.550 --> 00:10:50.446
It wasn't easy standing in those lines

00:10:50.470 --> 00:10:53.646
trying to get into those male meetings.

00:10:53.670 --> 00:10:55.846
There were hundreds of us,

00:10:55.870 --> 00:10:58.486
and one by one, when we got to the door,

00:10:58.510 --> 00:11:02.166
we were told, "I'm sorry,
this meeting is just for men,"

00:11:02.190 --> 00:11:06.966
and we had to step back
and watch men get into the meeting

00:11:06.990 --> 00:11:09.126
as young as 12 years old,

00:11:09.150 --> 00:11:13.206
escorted and walked past us
as we all stood in line.

00:11:13.230 --> 00:11:15.966
But not one woman in that line
will forget that day,

00:11:15.990 --> 00:11:19.950
and not one little boy
that walked past us will forget that day.

00:11:21.670 --> 00:11:27.286
If we were a multinational corporation
or a government, and that had happened,

00:11:27.310 --> 00:11:28.926
there would be outrage,

00:11:28.950 --> 00:11:31.366
but we're just a religion.

00:11:31.390 --> 00:11:34.350
We're all just part of religions.

00:11:35.270 --> 00:11:38.006
We can't keep looking
at religion that way,

00:11:38.030 --> 00:11:40.886
because it doesn't only affect me,
it affects my daughter

00:11:40.910 --> 00:11:43.886
and all of your daughters
and what opportunities they have,

00:11:43.910 --> 00:11:46.163
what they can wear,
who they can love and marry,

00:11:46.188 --> 00:11:49.286
if they have access
to reproductive healthcare.

00:11:49.310 --> 00:11:52.646
We need to reclaim morality
in a secular context

00:11:52.670 --> 00:11:54.926
that creates ethical scrutiny
and accountability

00:11:54.950 --> 00:11:57.126
for religions all around the world,

00:11:57.150 --> 00:12:00.286
but we need to do it in a respectful way

00:12:00.310 --> 00:12:03.526
that breeds cooperation and not extremism.

00:12:03.550 --> 00:12:07.606
And we can do it through
unignorable acts of bravery,

00:12:07.630 --> 00:12:10.966
standing up for gender equality.

00:12:10.990 --> 00:12:13.486
It's time that half
of the world's population

00:12:13.510 --> 00:12:16.446
had voice and equality
within our world's religions,

00:12:16.470 --> 00:12:21.006
churches, synagogues, mosques
and shrines around the world.

00:12:21.030 --> 00:12:24.590
I'm working on my people.
What are you doing for yours?

00:12:25.550 --> 00:12:31.390
(Applause)
