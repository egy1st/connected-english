00:00:13.316 --> 00:00:15.008
For much of the past century,

00:00:15.032 --> 00:00:17.840
architecture was under the spell
of a famous doctrine.

00:00:18.546 --> 00:00:22.141
"Form follows function" had become
modernity's ambitious manifesto

00:00:22.165 --> 00:00:24.418
and detrimental straitjacket,

00:00:24.442 --> 00:00:27.411
as it liberated architecture
from the decorative,

00:00:27.435 --> 00:00:31.336
but condemned it to utilitarian rigor
and restrained purpose.

00:00:32.568 --> 00:00:35.274
Of course, architecture is about function,

00:00:35.298 --> 00:00:38.965
but I want to remember a rewriting
of this phrase by Bernard Tschumi,

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:41.702
and I want to propose
a completely different quality.

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.263
If form follows fiction,

00:00:45.706 --> 00:00:49.889
we could think of architecture
and buildings as a space of stories --

00:00:49.913 --> 00:00:52.393
stories of the people that live there,

00:00:52.417 --> 00:00:54.772
of the people that work
in these buildings.

00:00:55.238 --> 00:00:59.253
And we could start to imagine
the experiences our buildings create.

00:01:00.115 --> 00:01:02.718
In this sense, I'm interested in fiction

00:01:02.742 --> 00:01:06.320
not as the implausible but as the real,

00:01:06.344 --> 00:01:08.342
as the reality of what architecture means

00:01:08.366 --> 00:01:10.714
for the people that live
in it and with it.

00:01:11.816 --> 00:01:15.415
Our buildings are prototypes,
ideas for how the space of living

00:01:15.439 --> 00:01:17.767
or how the space of working
could be different,

00:01:18.878 --> 00:01:22.379
and what a space of culture
or a space of media could look like today.

00:01:23.396 --> 00:01:25.476
Our buildings are real;
they're being built.

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.359
They're an explicit engagement
in physical reality

00:01:28.383 --> 00:01:30.511
and conceptual possibility.

00:01:32.163 --> 00:01:35.917
I think of our architecture
as organizational structures.

00:01:36.426 --> 00:01:40.054
At their core is indeed
structural thinking, like a system:

00:01:40.078 --> 00:01:43.229
How can we arrange things
in both a functional

00:01:43.253 --> 00:01:45.018
and experiential way?

00:01:46.338 --> 00:01:49.006
How can we create structures
that generate a series

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:51.449
of relationships and narratives?

00:01:51.822 --> 00:01:53.413
And how can fictive stories

00:01:53.437 --> 00:01:56.251
of the inhabitants and users
of our buildings

00:01:56.275 --> 00:01:58.227
script the architecture,

00:01:58.251 --> 00:02:01.618
while the architecture scripts
those stories at the same time?

00:02:02.578 --> 00:02:04.563
And here comes the second term into play,

00:02:04.587 --> 00:02:06.825
what I call "narrative hybrids" --

00:02:06.849 --> 00:02:09.594
structures of multiple
simultaneous stories

00:02:09.618 --> 00:02:12.348
that unfold throughout
the buildings we create.

00:02:12.856 --> 00:02:17.716
So we could think of architecture
as complex systems of relationships,

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:20.556
both in a programmatic and functional way

00:02:21.048 --> 00:02:25.551
and in an experiential
and emotive or social way.

00:02:27.337 --> 00:02:30.084
This is the headquarters
for China's national broadcaster,

00:02:30.108 --> 00:02:33.249
which I designed together
with Rem Koolhaas at OMA.

00:02:34.032 --> 00:02:38.171
When I first arrived in Beijing in 2002,
the city planners showed us this image:

00:02:38.195 --> 00:02:40.362
a forest of several hundred skyscrapers

00:02:40.386 --> 00:02:42.457
to emerge in the central
business district,

00:02:42.481 --> 00:02:45.102
except at that time,
only a handful of them existed.

00:02:45.539 --> 00:02:48.802
So we had to design in a context
that we knew almost nothing about,

00:02:48.826 --> 00:02:51.921
except one thing:
it would all be about verticality.

00:02:52.516 --> 00:02:57.295
Of course, the skyscraper is vertical --
it's a profoundly hierarchical structure,

00:02:57.319 --> 00:02:59.735
the top always the best,
the bottom the worst,

00:02:59.759 --> 00:03:02.922
and the taller you are,
the better, so it seems.

00:03:03.811 --> 00:03:05.320
And we wanted to ask ourselves,

00:03:05.344 --> 00:03:08.137
could a building be about
a completely different quality?

00:03:08.161 --> 00:03:12.114
Could it undo this hierarchy,
and could it be about a system

00:03:12.138 --> 00:03:15.362
that is more about collaboration,
rather than isolation?

00:03:15.386 --> 00:03:18.440
So we took this needle
and bent it back into itself,

00:03:18.464 --> 00:03:21.317
into a loop of interconnected activities.

00:03:22.016 --> 00:03:25.295
Our idea was to bring all aspects
of television-making

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:29.306
into one single structure: news,
program production, broadcasting,

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:31.552
research and training, administration --

00:03:31.576 --> 00:03:35.244
all into a circuit
of interconnected activities

00:03:35.268 --> 00:03:39.181
where people would meet in a process
of exchange and collaboration.

00:03:40.109 --> 00:03:41.927
I still very much like this image.

00:03:41.951 --> 00:03:45.074
It reminds one of biology classes,
if you remember the human body

00:03:45.098 --> 00:03:48.002
with all its organs
and circulatory systems, like at school.

00:03:48.026 --> 00:03:52.023
And suddenly you think of architecture
no longer as built substance,

00:03:52.047 --> 00:03:54.149
but as an organism, as a life form.

00:03:54.586 --> 00:03:56.933
And as you start to dissect this organism,

00:03:56.957 --> 00:04:01.686
you can identify a series
of primary technical clusters --

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:04.404
program production,
broadcasting center and news.

00:04:05.007 --> 00:04:08.487
Those are tightly intertwined
with social clusters:

00:04:08.511 --> 00:04:11.575
meeting rooms, canteens, chat areas --

00:04:11.599 --> 00:04:14.683
informal spaces for people
to meet and exchange.

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:19.648
So the organizational structure
of this building was a hybrid

00:04:19.672 --> 00:04:22.118
between the technical and the social,

00:04:22.142 --> 00:04:23.976
the human and the performative.

00:04:24.483 --> 00:04:28.123
And of course, we used the loop
of the building as a circulatory system,

00:04:28.147 --> 00:04:32.056
to thread everything together
and to allow both visitors and staff

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:35.665
to experience all these different
functions in a great unity.

00:04:37.268 --> 00:04:40.328
With 473,000 square meters,

00:04:40.352 --> 00:04:43.363
it is one of the largest buildings
ever built in the world.

00:04:43.387 --> 00:04:46.055
It has a population of over 10,000 people,

00:04:46.079 --> 00:04:49.665
and of course, this is a scale
that exceeds the comprehension

00:04:49.689 --> 00:04:52.449
of many things and the scale
of typical architecture.

00:04:52.473 --> 00:04:54.101
So we stopped work for a while

00:04:54.125 --> 00:04:58.430
and sat down and cut 10,000 little sticks
and glued them onto a model,

00:04:58.454 --> 00:05:02.477
just simply to confront ourselves
with what that quantity actually meant.

00:05:03.411 --> 00:05:05.021
But of course, it's not a number,

00:05:05.045 --> 00:05:09.654
it is the people, it is a community
that inhabits the building,

00:05:09.678 --> 00:05:14.131
and in order to both comprehend
this, but also script this architecture,

00:05:14.155 --> 00:05:17.401
we identified five characters,
hypothetical characters,

00:05:17.425 --> 00:05:21.994
and we followed them throughout their day
in a life in this building,

00:05:22.018 --> 00:05:24.901
thought of where they would meet,
what they would experience.

00:05:24.925 --> 00:05:28.064
So it was a way to script and design
the building, but of course,

00:05:28.088 --> 00:05:30.125
also to communicate its experiences.

00:05:30.149 --> 00:05:33.437
This was part of an exhibition
with the Museum of Modern Art

00:05:33.461 --> 00:05:35.769
in both New York and Beijing.

00:05:37.015 --> 00:05:39.214
This is the main broadcast control room,

00:05:39.238 --> 00:05:41.056
a technical installation so large,

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:44.412
it can broadcast over 200
channels simultaneously.

00:05:45.793 --> 00:05:49.213
And this is how the building
stands in Beijing today.

00:05:49.951 --> 00:05:53.245
Its first broadcast live
was the London Olympics 2012,

00:05:53.269 --> 00:05:57.324
after it had been completed
from the outside for the Beijing Olympics.

00:05:58.148 --> 00:06:02.211
And you can see at the very tip
of this 75-meter cantilever,

00:06:02.235 --> 00:06:03.789
those three little circles.

00:06:03.813 --> 00:06:07.314
And they're indeed part of a public loop
that goes through the building.

00:06:07.338 --> 00:06:09.890
They're a piece of glass
that you can stand on

00:06:09.914 --> 00:06:14.017
and watch the city pass by
below you in slow motion.

00:06:15.674 --> 00:06:18.924
The building has become
part of everyday life in Beijing.

00:06:18.948 --> 00:06:20.439
It is there.

00:06:20.463 --> 00:06:23.551
It has also become a very popular backdrop

00:06:23.575 --> 00:06:25.060
for wedding photography.

00:06:25.084 --> 00:06:27.946
(Laughter)

00:06:30.771 --> 00:06:33.745
But its most important moment
is maybe sill this one.

00:06:33.769 --> 00:06:35.823
"That's Beijing" is similar to "Time Out,"

00:06:35.847 --> 00:06:40.697
a magazine that broadcasts what
is happening in town during the week,

00:06:40.721 --> 00:06:45.684
and suddenly you see the building
portrayed no longer as physical matter,

00:06:45.708 --> 00:06:47.223
but actually as an urban actor,

00:06:47.247 --> 00:06:51.936
as part of a series of personas
that define the life of the city.

00:06:53.137 --> 00:06:58.047
So architecture suddenly
assumes the quality of a player,

00:06:58.071 --> 00:07:01.994
of something that writes stories
and performs stories.

00:07:02.769 --> 00:07:07.081
And I think that could be one
of its primary meanings

00:07:07.105 --> 00:07:08.352
that we believe in.

00:07:08.376 --> 00:07:10.987
But of course, there's another
story to this building.

00:07:11.011 --> 00:07:13.940
It is the story of the people
that made it --

00:07:13.964 --> 00:07:16.782
400 engineers and architects
that I was guiding

00:07:16.806 --> 00:07:19.397
over almost a decade of collaborative work

00:07:19.421 --> 00:07:22.388
that we spent together
in scripting this building,

00:07:22.412 --> 00:07:24.318
in imagining its reality

00:07:24.342 --> 00:07:27.633
and ultimately getting it built in China.

00:07:29.887 --> 00:07:34.243
This is a residential development
in Singapore, large scale.

00:07:34.691 --> 00:07:38.921
If we look at Singapore like most of Asia
and more and more of the world,

00:07:38.945 --> 00:07:42.492
of course, it is dominated by the tower,

00:07:42.516 --> 00:07:47.037
a typology that indeed creates
more isolation than connectedness,

00:07:47.061 --> 00:07:50.272
and I wanted to ask, how
could we think about living,

00:07:50.296 --> 00:07:54.121
not only in terms of the privacy
and individuality of ourselves

00:07:54.145 --> 00:07:55.581
and our apartment,

00:07:55.605 --> 00:07:58.241
but in an idea of a collective?

00:07:58.265 --> 00:08:01.664
How could we think about creating
a communal environment

00:08:01.688 --> 00:08:05.576
in which sharing things was as great
as having your own?

00:08:06.814 --> 00:08:11.510
The typical answer to the question --
we had to design 1,040 apartments --

00:08:11.534 --> 00:08:12.891
would have looked like this:

00:08:12.915 --> 00:08:15.661
24-story height limit given
by the planning authorities,

00:08:15.685 --> 00:08:19.659
12 towers with nothing
but residual in between --

00:08:19.683 --> 00:08:22.596
a very tight system that,
although the tower isolates you,

00:08:22.620 --> 00:08:26.127
it doesn't even give you privacy,
because you're so close to the next one,

00:08:26.151 --> 00:08:29.441
that it is very questionable
what the qualities of this would be.

00:08:30.638 --> 00:08:34.932
So I proposed to topple the towers,
throw the vertical into the horizontal

00:08:34.956 --> 00:08:36.746
and stack them up,

00:08:36.770 --> 00:08:39.317
and what looks a bit random from the side,

00:08:39.341 --> 00:08:42.135
if you look from the viewpoint
of the helicopter,

00:08:42.159 --> 00:08:46.888
you can see its organizational structure
is actually a hexagonal grid,

00:08:46.912 --> 00:08:50.649
in which these horizontal
building blocks are stacked up

00:08:50.673 --> 00:08:55.742
to create huge outdoor courtyards --
central spaces for the community,

00:08:55.766 --> 00:08:59.122
programmed with a variety
of amenities and functions.

00:08:59.950 --> 00:09:03.237
And you see that these courtyards
are not hermetically sealed spaces.

00:09:03.261 --> 00:09:05.753
They're open, permeable;
they're interconnected.

00:09:05.777 --> 00:09:08.001
We called the project "The Interlace,"

00:09:08.025 --> 00:09:10.999
thinking that we interlace
and interconnect

00:09:11.023 --> 00:09:13.938
the human beings and the spaces alike.

00:09:14.652 --> 00:09:17.543
And the detailed quality
of everything we designed

00:09:17.567 --> 00:09:21.399
was about animating the space
and giving the space to the inhabitants.

00:09:21.423 --> 00:09:22.820
And, in fact, it was a system

00:09:22.844 --> 00:09:26.312
where we would layer
primarily communal spaces,

00:09:26.336 --> 00:09:30.296
stacked to more and more
individual and private spaces.

00:09:30.812 --> 00:09:32.655
So we would open up a spectrum

00:09:32.679 --> 00:09:35.869
between the collective and the individual.

00:09:36.353 --> 00:09:37.504
A little piece of math:

00:09:37.528 --> 00:09:40.079
if we count all the green
that we left on the ground,

00:09:40.103 --> 00:09:42.188
minus the footprint of the buildings,

00:09:42.212 --> 00:09:45.639
and we would add back
the green of all the terraces,

00:09:45.663 --> 00:09:47.717
we have 112 percent green space,

00:09:47.741 --> 00:09:50.224
so more nature than not
having built a building.

00:09:50.613 --> 00:09:54.615
And of course this little piece of math
shows you that we are multiplying

00:09:54.639 --> 00:09:57.496
the space available
to those who live there.

00:09:57.980 --> 00:10:01.164
This is, in fact, the 13th floor
of one of these terraces.

00:10:01.188 --> 00:10:05.807
So you see new datum planes,
new grounds planes for social activity.

00:10:06.942 --> 00:10:09.880
We paid a lot of attention
to sustainability.

00:10:10.362 --> 00:10:13.941
In the tropics, the sun is the most
important thing to pay attention to,

00:10:13.965 --> 00:10:17.027
and, in fact, it is seeking
protection from the sun.

00:10:17.051 --> 00:10:20.188
We first proved that all apartments
would have sufficient daylight

00:10:20.212 --> 00:10:21.385
through the year.

00:10:21.798 --> 00:10:24.459
We then went on to optimize
the glazing of the facades

00:10:24.483 --> 00:10:27.052
to minimize the energy
consumption of the building.

00:10:28.131 --> 00:10:31.546
But most importantly, we could prove
that through the geometry

00:10:31.570 --> 00:10:33.146
of the building design,

00:10:33.170 --> 00:10:36.532
the building itself would provide
sufficient shading to the courtyards

00:10:36.556 --> 00:10:39.558
so that those would be usable
throughout the entire year.

00:10:39.582 --> 00:10:43.060
We further placed water bodies
along the prevailing wind corridors,

00:10:43.084 --> 00:10:46.804
so that evaporative cooling
would create microclimates

00:10:46.828 --> 00:10:50.313
that, again, would enhance
the quality of those spaces

00:10:50.337 --> 00:10:52.748
available for the inhabitants.

00:10:53.923 --> 00:10:57.669
And it was the idea of creating
this variety of choices,

00:10:57.693 --> 00:11:01.766
of freedom to think
where you would want to be,

00:11:01.790 --> 00:11:03.694
where you would want to escape, maybe,

00:11:03.718 --> 00:11:07.536
within the own complexity
of the complex in which you live.

00:11:09.186 --> 00:11:11.226
But coming from Asia to Europe:

00:11:11.250 --> 00:11:15.106
a building for a German
media company based in Berlin,

00:11:15.130 --> 00:11:19.550
transitioning from the traditional
print media to the digital media.

00:11:19.980 --> 00:11:22.844
And its CEO asked a few
very pertinent questions:

00:11:23.296 --> 00:11:25.901
Why would anyone today
still want to go to the office,

00:11:25.925 --> 00:11:28.114
because you can actually work anywhere?

00:11:28.138 --> 00:11:32.011
And how could a digital identity
of a company be embodied

00:11:32.035 --> 00:11:33.186
in a building?

00:11:34.297 --> 00:11:38.120
We created not only an object,
but at the center of this object

00:11:38.144 --> 00:11:39.739
we created a giant space,

00:11:39.763 --> 00:11:43.437
and this space was about
the experience of a collective,

00:11:43.461 --> 00:11:46.328
the experience of collaboration
and of togetherness.

00:11:47.161 --> 00:11:50.776
Communication, interaction
as the center of a space

00:11:50.800 --> 00:11:53.339
that in itself would float,

00:11:53.363 --> 00:11:55.475
like what we call the collaborative cloud,

00:11:55.499 --> 00:11:57.007
in the middle of the building,

00:11:57.031 --> 00:12:00.419
surrounded by an envelope
of standard modular offices.

00:12:01.094 --> 00:12:04.244
So with only a few steps
from your quiet work desk,

00:12:04.268 --> 00:12:07.995
you could participate
in the giant collective experience

00:12:08.019 --> 00:12:09.648
of the central space.

00:12:12.309 --> 00:12:15.888
Finally, we come to London,
a project commissioned

00:12:15.912 --> 00:12:18.490
by the London Legacy
Development Corporation

00:12:18.514 --> 00:12:19.943
of the Mayor of London.

00:12:20.459 --> 00:12:22.647
We were asked to undertake a study

00:12:22.671 --> 00:12:25.463
and investigate the potential of a site

00:12:25.487 --> 00:12:27.958
out in Stratford in the Olympic Park.

00:12:28.379 --> 00:12:31.963
In the 19th century, Prince Albert
had created Albertopolis.

00:12:32.663 --> 00:12:36.401
And Boris Johnson thought
of creating Olympicopolis.

00:12:37.361 --> 00:12:41.633
The idea was to bring together
some of Britain's greatest institutions,

00:12:41.657 --> 00:12:45.517
some international ones,
and to create a new system of synergies.

00:12:45.953 --> 00:12:50.477
Prince Albert, as yet, created
Albertopolis in the 19th century,

00:12:50.501 --> 00:12:52.964
thought of showcasing
all achievements of mankind,

00:12:52.988 --> 00:12:55.788
bringing arts and science closer together.

00:12:56.232 --> 00:13:00.906
And he built Exhibition Road,
a linear sequence of those institutions.

00:13:01.986 --> 00:13:05.677
But of course, today's society
has moved on from there.

00:13:05.701 --> 00:13:07.657
We no longer live in a world

00:13:07.681 --> 00:13:10.361
in which everything
is as clearly delineated

00:13:10.385 --> 00:13:11.887
or separated from each other.

00:13:11.911 --> 00:13:15.300
We live in a world in which
boundaries start to blur

00:13:15.324 --> 00:13:16.792
between the different domains,

00:13:16.816 --> 00:13:20.806
and in which collaboration and interaction
becomes far more important

00:13:20.830 --> 00:13:22.614
than keeping separations.

00:13:23.558 --> 00:13:26.577
So we wanted to think
of a giant culture machine,

00:13:26.601 --> 00:13:31.378
a building that would orchestrate
and animate the various domains,

00:13:31.402 --> 00:13:34.456
but allow them to interact
and collaborate.

00:13:35.361 --> 00:13:37.466
At the base of it is a very simple module,

00:13:37.490 --> 00:13:38.641
a ring module.

00:13:38.665 --> 00:13:42.308
It can function as a double-loaded
corridor, has daylight, has ventilation.

00:13:42.332 --> 00:13:43.483
It can be glazed over

00:13:43.507 --> 00:13:46.380
and turned into a giant
exhibitional performance space.

00:13:46.404 --> 00:13:48.529
These modules were stacked together

00:13:48.553 --> 00:13:52.315
with the idea that almost any
function could, over time,

00:13:52.339 --> 00:13:54.076
occupy any of these modules.

00:13:54.100 --> 00:13:57.216
So institutions could shrink or contract,

00:13:57.240 --> 00:14:01.961
as, of course, the future of culture
is, in a way, the most uncertain of all.

00:14:02.883 --> 00:14:05.838
This is how the building sits,
adjacent to the Aquatics Centre,

00:14:05.862 --> 00:14:07.813
opposite the Olympic Stadium.

00:14:08.758 --> 00:14:11.091
And you can see how
its cantilevering volumes

00:14:11.115 --> 00:14:13.905
project out and engage the public space

00:14:13.929 --> 00:14:17.630
and how its courtyards
animate the public inside.

00:14:19.463 --> 00:14:22.691
The idea was to create a complex system

00:14:22.715 --> 00:14:27.603
in which institutional entities
could maintain their own identity,

00:14:27.627 --> 00:14:30.560
in which they would not
be subsumed in a singular volume.

00:14:30.584 --> 00:14:33.750
Here's a scale comparison
to the Centre Pompidou in Paris.

00:14:33.774 --> 00:14:37.139
It both shows the enormous scale
and potential of the project,

00:14:37.163 --> 00:14:38.450
but also the difference:

00:14:38.474 --> 00:14:42.649
here, it is a multiplicity
of a heterogeneous structure,

00:14:42.673 --> 00:14:45.184
in which different entities can interact

00:14:45.208 --> 00:14:47.667
without losing their own identity.

00:14:48.545 --> 00:14:52.495
And it was this thought: to create
an organizational structure

00:14:52.519 --> 00:14:55.352
that would allow for multiple
narratives to be scripted --

00:14:55.376 --> 00:15:00.830
for those in the educational parts
that create and think culture;

00:15:00.854 --> 00:15:04.360
for those that present
the visual arts, the dance;

00:15:04.384 --> 00:15:07.193
and for the public to be
admitted into all of this

00:15:07.217 --> 00:15:09.863
with a series of possible trajectories,

00:15:09.887 --> 00:15:12.619
to script their own reading
of these narratives

00:15:12.643 --> 00:15:14.276
and their own experience.

00:15:16.625 --> 00:15:20.031
And I want to end on a project
that is very small,

00:15:20.055 --> 00:15:21.308
in a way, very different:

00:15:22.046 --> 00:15:24.094
a floating cinema
in the ocean of Thailand.

00:15:24.118 --> 00:15:27.654
Friends of mine had founded
a film festival,

00:15:27.678 --> 00:15:28.868
and I thought,

00:15:29.376 --> 00:15:32.655
if we think of the stories
and narratives of movies,

00:15:32.679 --> 00:15:36.222
we should also think of the narratives
of the people that watch them.

00:15:36.246 --> 00:15:39.531
So I designed a small
modular floating platform,

00:15:39.555 --> 00:15:41.829
based on the techniques
of local fishermen,

00:15:41.853 --> 00:15:43.940
how they built their lobster
and fish farms.

00:15:43.964 --> 00:15:46.343
We collaborated with the local community

00:15:46.367 --> 00:15:50.099
and built, out of recycled
materials of their own,

00:15:50.123 --> 00:15:52.245
this fantastical floating platform

00:15:52.269 --> 00:15:54.190
that gently moved in the ocean

00:15:54.214 --> 00:15:57.098
as we watched films
from the British film archive,

00:15:57.122 --> 00:15:59.788
[1903] "Alice in Wonderland," for example.

00:16:00.137 --> 00:16:03.194
The most primordial
experiences of the audience

00:16:03.218 --> 00:16:06.283
merged with the stories of the movies.

00:16:07.990 --> 00:16:12.800
So I believe that architecture exceeds
the domain of physical matter,

00:16:12.824 --> 00:16:14.284
of the built environment,

00:16:14.308 --> 00:16:17.497
but is really about how
we want to live our lives,

00:16:17.521 --> 00:16:20.583
how we script our own stories
and those of others.

00:16:21.035 --> 00:16:22.186
Thank you.

00:16:22.210 --> 00:16:25.623
(Applause)
