WEBVTT

00:00:13.069 --> 00:00:17.411
So, I have an overlooked
but potentially lucrative

00:00:17.435 --> 00:00:19.414
investment opportunity for you.

00:00:20.597 --> 00:00:23.011
Over the past 10 years in the UK,

00:00:23.035 --> 00:00:26.470
the return on burial plots
has outperformed the UK property market

00:00:26.494 --> 00:00:28.797
by a ratio of around three to one.

00:00:30.074 --> 00:00:33.896
There are private cemeteries being set up
with plots for sale to investors,

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:37.064
and they start at around 3,900 pounds.

00:00:37.088 --> 00:00:40.610
And they're projected to achieve
about 40 percent growth.

00:00:40.634 --> 00:00:45.702
The biggest advantage is that this
is a market with continuous demand.

00:00:48.146 --> 00:00:50.211
Now, this is a real proposition,

00:00:50.235 --> 00:00:54.681
and there are companies out there
that really are offering this investment,

00:00:54.705 --> 00:00:57.467
but my interest in it is quite different.

00:00:57.863 --> 00:00:59.905
I'm an architect and urban designer,

00:00:59.929 --> 00:01:01.520
and for the past year and a half,

00:01:01.544 --> 00:01:04.544
I've been looking at approaches
to death and dying

00:01:04.568 --> 00:01:07.879
and at how they've shaped our cities
and the buildings within them.

00:01:08.665 --> 00:01:11.825
So in the summer,
I did my first exhibition

00:01:11.849 --> 00:01:14.365
on death and architecture in Venice,

00:01:14.389 --> 00:01:16.269
and it was called "Death in Venice."

00:01:16.713 --> 00:01:18.714
And because death is a subject

00:01:18.738 --> 00:01:21.795
that many of us find quite
uncomfortable to talk about,

00:01:21.819 --> 00:01:24.144
the exhibition was designed
to be quite playful,

00:01:24.168 --> 00:01:26.667
so that people would
literally engage with it.

00:01:27.032 --> 00:01:30.577
So one of our exhibits
was an interactive map of London

00:01:30.601 --> 00:01:33.619
which showed just how much
of the real estate in the city

00:01:33.643 --> 00:01:35.593
is given over to death.

00:01:35.617 --> 00:01:37.799
As you wave your hand across the map,

00:01:37.823 --> 00:01:41.328
the name of the piece of real estate --
the building or the cemetery --

00:01:41.352 --> 00:01:42.502
is revealed.

00:01:42.883 --> 00:01:45.623
And those white shapes that you can see,

00:01:45.647 --> 00:01:48.556
they're all of the hospitals and hospices

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:51.311
and mortuaries and cemeteries in the city.

00:01:51.335 --> 00:01:53.397
In fact, the majority are cemeteries.

00:01:53.802 --> 00:01:58.504
We wanted to show that, even though
death and burial are things

00:01:58.528 --> 00:02:00.019
that we might not think about,

00:02:00.043 --> 00:02:03.573
they're all around us, and they're
important parts of our cities.

00:02:04.185 --> 00:02:08.645
So about half a million people
die in the UK each year,

00:02:08.669 --> 00:02:11.698
and of those, around a quarter
will want to be buried.

00:02:11.722 --> 00:02:15.662
But the UK, like many
Western European countries,

00:02:15.686 --> 00:02:17.361
is running out of burial space,

00:02:17.385 --> 00:02:19.265
especially in the major cities.

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:23.336
And the Greater London Authority
has been aware of this for a while,

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:26.828
and the main causes are population growth,

00:02:26.852 --> 00:02:29.693
the fact that existing
cemeteries are almost full.

00:02:29.717 --> 00:02:34.024
There's a custom in the UK that graves
are considered to be occupied forever,

00:02:34.048 --> 00:02:37.775
and there's also development pressure --
people want to use that same land

00:02:37.799 --> 00:02:41.358
to build houses or offices or shops.

00:02:42.046 --> 00:02:43.847
So they came up with a few solutions.

00:02:43.871 --> 00:02:47.914
They were like, well, maybe we can
reuse those graves after 50 years.

00:02:47.938 --> 00:02:50.251
Or maybe we can bury people,
like, four deep,

00:02:50.275 --> 00:02:53.263
so that four people can be buried
in the same plot,

00:02:53.287 --> 00:02:55.930
and we can make more efficient use
of the land that way,

00:02:55.954 --> 00:02:59.294
and in that way, hopefully London
will still have space to bury people

00:02:59.318 --> 00:03:00.469
in the near future.

00:03:01.256 --> 00:03:03.918
But, traditionally, cemeteries
haven't been taken care of

00:03:03.942 --> 00:03:05.682
by the local authority.

00:03:05.706 --> 00:03:09.072
In fact, the surprising thing is that
there's no legal obligation

00:03:09.096 --> 00:03:12.125
on anyone in the UK
to provide burial space.

00:03:12.649 --> 00:03:17.432
Traditionally, it's been done
by private and religious organizations,

00:03:17.456 --> 00:03:20.267
like churches and mosques and synagogues.

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:24.585
But there's also occasionally
been a for-profit group

00:03:24.609 --> 00:03:26.626
who has wanted to get in on the act.

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:30.155
And, you know, they look at
the small size of a burial plot

00:03:30.179 --> 00:03:31.847
and that high cost,

00:03:31.871 --> 00:03:34.363
and it looks like there's
serious money to be made.

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:38.444
So, actually, if you want to go out
and start your own cemetery,

00:03:38.468 --> 00:03:39.891
you kind of can.

00:03:39.915 --> 00:03:42.051
There was this couple in South Wales,

00:03:42.075 --> 00:03:45.311
and they had a farmhouse
and a load of fields next to it,

00:03:45.335 --> 00:03:47.466
and they wanted to develop the land.

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:48.891
They had a load of ideas.

00:03:48.915 --> 00:03:52.029
They first thought about making
a caravan park,

00:03:52.053 --> 00:03:53.767
but the council said no.

00:03:53.791 --> 00:03:55.759
And then they wanted to make a fish farm

00:03:55.783 --> 00:03:57.504
and again the council said no.

00:03:57.901 --> 00:04:00.572
Then they hit on the idea
of making a cemetery

00:04:00.596 --> 00:04:02.652
and they calculated that by doing this,

00:04:02.676 --> 00:04:05.193
they could increase
the value of their land

00:04:05.217 --> 00:04:09.946
from about 95,000 pounds
to over one million pounds.

00:04:10.952 --> 00:04:15.711
But just to come back to this idea
of making profit from cemeteries,

00:04:15.735 --> 00:04:17.805
like, it's kind of ludicrous, right?

00:04:18.417 --> 00:04:21.930
The thing is that the high cost
of those burial plots

00:04:21.954 --> 00:04:24.070
is actually very misleading.

00:04:24.094 --> 00:04:25.881
They look like they're expensive,

00:04:25.905 --> 00:04:30.107
but that cost reflects the fact that
you need to maintain the burial plot --

00:04:30.131 --> 00:04:33.439
like, someone has to cut the grass
for the next 50 years.

00:04:33.463 --> 00:04:36.360
That means it's very difficult
to make money from cemeteries.

00:04:36.384 --> 00:04:39.209
And it's the reason that normally
they're run by the council

00:04:39.233 --> 00:04:41.229
or by a not-for-profit group.

00:04:41.253 --> 00:04:43.904
But anyway, the council granted
these people permission,

00:04:43.928 --> 00:04:46.379
and they're now trying
to build their cemetery.

00:04:46.403 --> 00:04:49.723
So just to explain to you
kind of how this works:

00:04:49.747 --> 00:04:51.804
If I want to build something in the UK,

00:04:51.828 --> 00:04:54.020
like a cemetery for example,

00:04:54.044 --> 00:04:57.018
then I have to apply
for planning permission first.

00:04:57.042 --> 00:05:01.252
So if I want to build a new
office building for a client

00:05:01.276 --> 00:05:03.530
or if I want to extend my home

00:05:03.554 --> 00:05:07.323
or, you know, if I have a shop
and I want to convert it into an office,

00:05:07.347 --> 00:05:08.878
I have to do a load of drawings,

00:05:08.902 --> 00:05:11.338
and I submit them
to the council for permission.

00:05:11.362 --> 00:05:15.319
And they'll look at things like
how it fits in the surroundings.

00:05:15.343 --> 00:05:17.375
So they'll look at what it looks like.

00:05:17.399 --> 00:05:20.995
But they'll also think about things
like what impact is it going to have

00:05:21.019 --> 00:05:22.494
on the local environment?

00:05:22.518 --> 00:05:24.558
And they'll be thinking about things like,

00:05:24.582 --> 00:05:26.423
is this thing going to cause pollution

00:05:26.447 --> 00:05:28.375
or is there going to be a lot of traffic

00:05:28.399 --> 00:05:30.732
that wants to go to this thing
that I've built?

00:05:30.756 --> 00:05:32.136
But also good things.

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:35.477
Is it going to add local services
like shops to the neighborhood

00:05:35.501 --> 00:05:37.563
that local people would like to use?

00:05:38.333 --> 00:05:41.027
And they'll weigh up the advantages
and the disadvantages

00:05:41.051 --> 00:05:42.487
and they'll make a decision.

00:05:43.058 --> 00:05:47.030
So that's how it works if I want
to build a large cemetery.

00:05:47.506 --> 00:05:49.500
But what if I've got a piece of land

00:05:49.524 --> 00:05:52.842
and I just want to bury
a few people, like five or six?

00:05:53.683 --> 00:05:57.302
Well, then -- actually, I don't need
permission from anyone!

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:02.366
There's actually almost no regulation
in the UK around burial,

00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:06.033
and the little bit that there is,
is about not polluting water courses,

00:06:06.057 --> 00:06:08.667
like not polluting rivers or groundwater.

00:06:09.112 --> 00:06:12.136
So actually, if you want to go
and make your own mini-cemetery,

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:13.455
then you can.

00:06:13.479 --> 00:06:16.907
But I mean, like -- really,
who does this? Right?

00:06:18.161 --> 00:06:21.779
Well, if you're an aristocratic family
and you have a large estate,

00:06:21.803 --> 00:06:24.486
then there's a chance that you'll
have a mausoleum on it,

00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:26.319
and you'll bury your family there.

00:06:26.858 --> 00:06:29.017
But the really weird thing

00:06:29.041 --> 00:06:32.410
is that you don't need to have
a piece of land of a certain size

00:06:32.434 --> 00:06:35.036
before you're allowed
to start burying people on it.

00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:37.005
And so that means that, technically,

00:06:37.029 --> 00:06:40.718
this applies to, like, the back garden
of your house in the suburbs.

00:06:40.742 --> 00:06:42.071
(Laughter)

00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:46.544
So what if you wanted
to try this yourself at home?

00:06:46.568 --> 00:06:50.616
Well, there's a few councils
that have guidance on their website

00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:52.027
which can help you.

00:06:52.051 --> 00:06:54.145
So, the first thing that they tell you

00:06:54.169 --> 00:06:57.905
is that you need to have a certificate
of burial before you can go ahead --

00:06:57.929 --> 00:07:01.277
you're not allowed to just murder people
and put them under the patio.

00:07:01.301 --> 00:07:03.301
(Laughter)

00:07:04.403 --> 00:07:08.206
They also tell you that you need to keep
a record of where the grave is.

00:07:08.230 --> 00:07:10.863
But that's pretty much it
for formal requirements.

00:07:10.887 --> 00:07:13.889
Now, they do warn you that
your neighbors might not like this,

00:07:13.913 --> 00:07:17.816
but, legally speaking, there's almost
nothing that they can do about it.

00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:23.006
And just in case any of you
still had that profit idea in your mind

00:07:23.030 --> 00:07:25.291
about how much those burial plots cost

00:07:25.315 --> 00:07:27.663
and how much money
you might be able to make,

00:07:27.687 --> 00:07:30.433
they also warn that it might cause
the value of your house

00:07:30.457 --> 00:07:32.187
to drop by 20 percent.

00:07:32.665 --> 00:07:34.412
Although, actually, it's more likely

00:07:34.436 --> 00:07:37.404
that no one will want to buy
your house at all after that.

00:07:38.491 --> 00:07:41.050
So what I find fascinating about this

00:07:41.074 --> 00:07:45.739
is the fact that it kind of sums up
many of our attitudes towards death.

00:07:46.430 --> 00:07:50.846
In the UK, and I think that the figures
across Europe are probably similar,

00:07:50.870 --> 00:07:53.981
only about 30 percent of people
have ever talked to anyone

00:07:54.005 --> 00:07:55.697
about their wishes around death,

00:07:55.721 --> 00:07:57.631
and even for people over 75,

00:07:57.655 --> 00:08:01.241
only 45 percent of people
have ever talked about this.

00:08:01.614 --> 00:08:04.289
And the reasons that
people give ... you know,

00:08:04.313 --> 00:08:06.134
they think that their death is far off

00:08:06.158 --> 00:08:09.035
or they think that they're going
to make people uncomfortable

00:08:09.059 --> 00:08:10.445
by talking about it.

00:08:10.469 --> 00:08:12.224
And you know, to a certain extent,

00:08:12.248 --> 00:08:15.886
there are other people out there
who are taking care of things for us.

00:08:15.910 --> 00:08:19.591
The government has all this regulation
and bureaucracy around things

00:08:19.615 --> 00:08:21.848
like burying a death, for example,

00:08:21.872 --> 00:08:23.841
and there's people like funeral directors

00:08:23.865 --> 00:08:26.461
who devote their entire
working lives to this issue.

00:08:26.485 --> 00:08:27.991
But when it comes to our cities

00:08:28.015 --> 00:08:31.057
and thinking about how
death fits in our cities,

00:08:31.081 --> 00:08:35.130
there's much less regulation
and design and thought

00:08:35.154 --> 00:08:36.470
than we might imagine.

00:08:36.494 --> 00:08:38.708
So we're not thinking about this,

00:08:38.732 --> 00:08:41.632
but all of the people we imagine
are thinking about it --

00:08:41.656 --> 00:08:43.701
they're not taking care of it either.

00:08:43.725 --> 00:08:44.883
Thank you.

00:08:44.907 --> 00:08:47.865
(Applause)
