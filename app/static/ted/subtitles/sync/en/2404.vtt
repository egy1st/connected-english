00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:16.726
Our grandparents' generation
created an amazing system

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:19.326
of canals and reservoirs
that made it possible

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:22.766
for people to live in places
where there wasn't a lot of water.

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:25.326
For example, during the Great Depression,

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:26.966
they created the Hoover Dam,

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:29.406
which in turn, created Lake Mead

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:33.046
and made it possible for the cities
of Las Vegas and Phoenix

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:34.806
and Los Angeles to provide water

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:37.030
for people who lived
in a really dry place.

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:41.806
In the 20th century,
we literally spent trillions of dollars

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:45.246
building infrastructure
to get water to our cities.

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:49.206
In terms of economic development,
it was a great investment.

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.206
But in the last decade,
we've seen the combined effects

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:58.006
of climate change, population growth
and competition for water resources

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:01.686
threaten these vital lifelines
and water resources.

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:05.846
This figure shows you the change
in the lake level of Lake Mead

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:08.126
that happened in the last 15 years.

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:10.486
You can see starting around the year 2000,

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:12.406
the lake level started to drop.

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:14.246
And it was dropping at such a rate

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:18.150
that it would have left the drinking water
intakes for Las Vegas high and dry.

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:21.606
The city became so concerned about this

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.566
that they recently constructed
a new drinking water intake structure

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.646
that they referred to as the "Third Straw"

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:30.390
to pull water out
of the greater depths of the lake.

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:34.886
The challenges associated
with providing water to a modern city

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:37.966
are not restricted
to the American Southwest.

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:43.326
In the year 2007, the third largest
city in Australia, Brisbane,

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:46.286
came within 6 months
of running out of water.

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:50.566
A similar drama is playing out today
in São Paulo, Brazil,

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:52.406
where the main reservoir for the city

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:55.326
has gone from being
completely full in 2010,

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.526
to being nearly empty today

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:01.030
as the city approaches
the 2016 Summer Olympics.

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:04.686
For those of us who are fortunate enough

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:06.766
to live in one
of the world's great cities,

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:10.926
we've never truly experienced
the effects of a catastrophic drought.

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:14.686
We like to complain
about the navy showers we have to take.

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:19.086
We like our neighbors to see
our dirty cars and our brown lawns.

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:22.646
But we've never really faced
the prospect of turning on the tap

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:24.190
and having nothing come out.

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:27.886
And that's because when things
have gotten bad in the past,

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:30.966
it's always been possible
to expand a reservoir

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:33.190
or dig a few more groundwater wells.

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:38.086
Well, in a time when all
of the water resources are spoken for,

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:41.486
it's not going to be possible
to rely on this tried and true way

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:43.846
of providing ourselves with water.

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:47.646
Some people think that we're going
to solve the urban water problem

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:49.670
by taking water from our rural neighbors.

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:56.806
But that's an approach that's fraught
with political, legal and social dangers.

00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:00.366
And even if we succeed in grabbing
the water from our rural neighbors,

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:02.886
we're just transferring
the problem to someone else

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:05.526
and there's a good chance
it will come back and bite us

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:07.446
in the form of higher food prices

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:11.430
and damage to the aquatic ecosystems
that already rely upon that water.

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:15.726
I think that there's a better way
to solve our urban water crisis

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:20.166
and I think that's to open up
four new local sources of water

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:21.926
that I liken to faucets.

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:26.046
If we can make smart investments
in these new sources of water

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:27.366
in the coming years,

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:29.726
we can solve our urban water problem

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:33.086
and decrease the likelihood
that we'll ever run across

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:35.350
the effects of a catastrophic drought.

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:38.486
Now, if you told me 20 years ago

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:43.126
that a modern city could exist
without a supply of imported water,

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:46.790
I probably would have dismissed you
as an unrealistic and uninformed dreamer.

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:49.166
But my own experiences

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:53.566
working with some of the world's most
water-starved cities in the last decades

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:57.526
have shown me that we have
the technologies and the management skills

00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:00.446
to actually transition away
from imported water,

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:02.790
and that's what I want
to tell you about tonight.

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:07.766
The first source of local water
supply that we need to develop

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:09.926
to solve our urban water problem

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:13.206
will flow with the rainwater
that falls in our cities.

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:16.646
One of the great tragedies
of urban development

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:18.646
is that as our cities grew,

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:22.326
we started covering all the surfaces
with concrete and asphalt.

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:24.766
And when we did that,
we had to build storm sewers

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:26.886
to get the water
that fell on the cities out

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:28.846
before it could cause flooding,

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:31.710
and that's a waste
of a vital water resource.

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:34.126
Let me give you an example.

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:37.366
This figure here shows you
the volume of water

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:40.006
that could be collected
in the city of San Jose

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:43.806
if they could harvest the stormwater
that fell within the city limits.

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:48.606
You can see from the intersection
of the blue line and the black dotted line

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:52.926
that if San Jose could just capture half
of the water that fell within the city,

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:56.286
they'd have enough water
to get them through an entire year.

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:58.926
Now, I know what some of you
are probably thinking.

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:02.526
"The answer to our problem
is to start building great big tanks

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:05.406
and attaching them
to the downspouts of our roof gutters,

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:06.670
rainwater harvesting."

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:09.726
Now, that's an idea
that might work in some places.

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:13.006
But if you live in a place
where it mainly rains in the winter time

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:15.446
and most of the water demand
is in the summertime,

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:19.206
it's not a very cost-effective way
to solve a water problem.

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:22.246
And if you experience the effects
of a multiyear drought,

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:24.446
like California's currently experiencing,

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:28.686
you just can't build a rainwater tank
that's big enough to solve your problem.

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:30.726
I think there's a lot more practical way

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:34.246
to harvest the stormwater and
the rainwater that falls in our cities,

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:38.046
and that's to capture it
and let it percolate into the ground.

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:43.246
After all, many of our cities are sitting
on top of a natural water storage system

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:45.670
that can accommodate
huge volumes of water.

00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:50.046
For example, historically,
Los Angeles has obtained

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:53.086
about a third of its water supply
from a massive aquifer

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:55.150
that underlies the San Fernando Valley.

00:05:56.550 --> 00:05:59.326
Now, when you look at the water
that comes off of your roof

00:05:59.350 --> 00:06:01.806
and runs off of your lawn
and flows down the gutter,

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:04.950
you might say to yourself,
"Do I really want to drink that stuff?"

00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:07.846
Well, the answer is
you don't want to drink it

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:09.686
until it's been treated a little bit.

00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:12.806
And so the challenge that we face
in urban water harvesting

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:15.566
is to capture the water, clean the water

00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:16.830
and get it underground.

00:06:17.670 --> 00:06:20.686
And that's exactly
what the city of Los Angeles is doing

00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:24.806
with a new project that they're building
in Burbank, California.

00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:28.926
This figure here shows
the stormwater park that they're building

00:06:28.950 --> 00:06:34.126
by hooking a series of stormwater
collection systems, or storm sewers,

00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:37.726
and routing that water
into an abandoned gravel quarry.

00:06:37.750 --> 00:06:39.646
The water that's captured in the quarry

00:06:39.670 --> 00:06:42.446
is slowly passed
through a man-made wetland,

00:06:42.470 --> 00:06:45.086
and then it goes
into that ball field there

00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:47.046
and percolates into the ground,

00:06:47.070 --> 00:06:49.430
recharging the drinking water
aquifer of the city.

00:06:50.110 --> 00:06:53.126
And in the process
of passing through the wetland

00:06:53.150 --> 00:06:54.926
and percolating through the ground,

00:06:54.950 --> 00:06:58.446
the water encounters microbes
that live on the surfaces of the plants

00:06:58.470 --> 00:07:00.046
and the surfaces of the soil,

00:07:00.070 --> 00:07:01.550
and that purifies the water.

00:07:02.310 --> 00:07:04.686
And if the water's
still not clean enough to drink

00:07:04.710 --> 00:07:07.406
after it's been through
this natural treatment process,

00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:08.766
the city can treat it again

00:07:08.790 --> 00:07:11.366
when they pump if back out
of the groundwater aquifers

00:07:11.390 --> 00:07:13.470
before they deliver it to people to drink.

00:07:14.590 --> 00:07:18.966
The second tap that we need to open up
to solve our urban water problem

00:07:18.990 --> 00:07:20.446
will flow with the wastewater

00:07:20.470 --> 00:07:22.630
that comes out
of our sewage treatment plants.

00:07:23.510 --> 00:07:26.987
Now, many of you are probably familiar
with the concept of recycled water.

00:07:27.011 --> 00:07:28.886
You've probably seen signs like this

00:07:28.910 --> 00:07:32.166
that tell you that the shrubbery
and the highway median

00:07:32.190 --> 00:07:33.686
and the local golf course

00:07:33.710 --> 00:07:35.566
is being watered with water

00:07:35.590 --> 00:07:37.870
that used to be
in a sewage treatment plant.

00:07:38.550 --> 00:07:41.486
We've been doing this
for a couple of decades now.

00:07:41.510 --> 00:07:43.526
But what we're learning
from our experience

00:07:43.550 --> 00:07:47.646
is that this approach is much more
expensive that we expected it to be.

00:07:47.670 --> 00:07:50.766
Because once we build
the first few water recycling systems

00:07:50.790 --> 00:07:52.566
close to the sewage treatment plant,

00:07:52.590 --> 00:07:54.829
we have to build longer
and longer pipe networks

00:07:54.853 --> 00:07:57.013
to get that water to where it needs to go.

00:07:57.750 --> 00:08:00.550
And that becomes prohibitive
in terms of cost.

00:08:01.150 --> 00:08:02.366
What we're finding is

00:08:02.390 --> 00:08:06.406
that a much more cost-effective
and practical way of recycling wastewater

00:08:06.430 --> 00:08:09.006
is to turn treated wastewater
into drinking water

00:08:09.030 --> 00:08:10.550
through a two-step process.

00:08:11.230 --> 00:08:14.366
In the first step in this process
we pressurize the water

00:08:14.390 --> 00:08:17.126
and pass it through
a reverse osmosis membrane:

00:08:17.150 --> 00:08:19.566
a thin, permeable plastic membrane

00:08:19.590 --> 00:08:22.126
that allows water molecules
to pass through

00:08:22.150 --> 00:08:26.926
but traps and retains the salts,
the viruses and the organic chemicals

00:08:26.950 --> 00:08:28.870
that might be present in the wastewater.

00:08:29.670 --> 00:08:31.606
In the second step in the process,

00:08:31.630 --> 00:08:34.126
we add a small amount of hydrogen peroxide

00:08:34.150 --> 00:08:36.846
and shine ultraviolet light on the water.

00:08:36.870 --> 00:08:39.766
The ultraviolet light
cleaves the hydrogen peroxide

00:08:39.790 --> 00:08:42.926
into two parts that are called
hydroxyl radicals,

00:08:42.950 --> 00:08:47.045
and these hydroxyl radicals
are very potent forms of oxygen

00:08:47.069 --> 00:08:49.470
that break down most organic chemicals.

00:08:50.270 --> 00:08:53.326
After the water's been
through this two-stage process,

00:08:53.350 --> 00:08:54.966
it's safe to drink.

00:08:54.990 --> 00:08:56.246
I know,

00:08:56.270 --> 00:08:58.846
I've been studying recycled water

00:08:58.870 --> 00:09:02.286
using every measurement technique
known to modern science

00:09:02.310 --> 00:09:03.750
for the past 15 years.

00:09:04.470 --> 00:09:05.886
We've detected some chemicals

00:09:05.910 --> 00:09:08.486
that can make it through
the first step in the process,

00:09:08.510 --> 00:09:10.510
but by the time we get to the second step,

00:09:10.534 --> 00:09:12.446
the advanced oxidation process,

00:09:12.470 --> 00:09:14.886
we rarely see any chemicals present.

00:09:14.910 --> 00:09:19.086
And that's in stark contrast
to the taken-for-granted water supplies

00:09:19.110 --> 00:09:20.990
that we regularly drink all the time.

00:09:22.190 --> 00:09:24.566
There's another way we can recycle water.

00:09:24.590 --> 00:09:27.686
This is an engineered treatment wetland
that we recently built

00:09:27.710 --> 00:09:30.486
on the Santa Ana River
in Southern California.

00:09:30.510 --> 00:09:34.606
The treatment wetland receives water
from a part of the Santa Ana River

00:09:34.630 --> 00:09:38.246
that in the summertime consists
almost entirely of wastewater effluent

00:09:38.270 --> 00:09:41.286
from cities like Riverside
and San Bernardino.

00:09:41.310 --> 00:09:43.366
The water comes
into our treatment wetland,

00:09:43.390 --> 00:09:45.726
it's exposed to sunlight and algae

00:09:45.750 --> 00:09:48.246
and those break down
the organic chemicals,

00:09:48.270 --> 00:09:51.806
remove the nutrients
and inactivate the waterborne pathogens.

00:09:51.830 --> 00:09:54.286
The water gets put back
in the Santa Ana River,

00:09:54.310 --> 00:09:56.206
it flows down to Anaheim,

00:09:56.230 --> 00:09:59.486
gets taken out at Anaheim
and percolated into the ground,

00:09:59.510 --> 00:10:02.166
and becomes the drinking water
of the city of Anaheim,

00:10:02.190 --> 00:10:06.126
completing the trip
from the sewers of Riverside County

00:10:06.150 --> 00:10:08.430
to the drinking water supply
of Orange County.

00:10:10.150 --> 00:10:13.566
Now, you might think
that this idea of drinking wastewater

00:10:13.590 --> 00:10:17.006
is some sort of futuristic fantasy
or not commonly done.

00:10:17.030 --> 00:10:21.406
Well, in California, we already recycle
about 40 billion gallons a year

00:10:21.430 --> 00:10:24.526
of wastewater through the two-stage
advanced treatment process

00:10:24.550 --> 00:10:25.846
I was telling you about.

00:10:25.870 --> 00:10:29.606
That's enough water to be
the supply of about a million people

00:10:29.630 --> 00:10:31.390
if it were their sole water supply.

00:10:32.430 --> 00:10:36.646
The third tap that we need to open up
will not be a tap at all,

00:10:36.670 --> 00:10:38.286
it will be a kind of virtual tap,

00:10:38.310 --> 00:10:41.406
it will be the water conservation
that we manage to do.

00:10:41.430 --> 00:10:44.886
And the place where we need to think
about water conservation is outdoors

00:10:44.910 --> 00:10:48.526
because in California
and other modern American cities,

00:10:48.550 --> 00:10:50.950
about half of our water use
happens outdoors.

00:10:51.910 --> 00:10:53.366
In the current drought,

00:10:53.390 --> 00:10:54.966
we've seen that it's possible

00:10:54.990 --> 00:10:57.966
to have our lawns survive
and our plants survive

00:10:57.990 --> 00:10:59.886
with about half as much water.

00:10:59.910 --> 00:11:02.926
So there's no need
to start painting concrete green

00:11:02.950 --> 00:11:06.046
and putting in Astroturf
and buying cactuses.

00:11:06.070 --> 00:11:10.286
We can have California-friendly
landscaping with soil moisture detectors

00:11:10.310 --> 00:11:12.206
and smart irrigation controllers

00:11:12.230 --> 00:11:14.670
and have beautiful
green landscapes in our cities.

00:11:15.910 --> 00:11:18.926
The fourth and final water tap
that we need to open up

00:11:18.950 --> 00:11:20.846
to solve our urban water problem

00:11:20.870 --> 00:11:22.910
will flow with desalinated seawater.

00:11:23.510 --> 00:11:27.486
Now, I know what you probably heard
people say about seawater desalination.

00:11:27.510 --> 00:11:31.686
"It's a great thing to do if you have
lots of oil, not a lot of water

00:11:31.710 --> 00:11:34.086
and you don't care about climate change."

00:11:34.110 --> 00:11:38.446
Seawater desalination is energy-intensive
no matter how you slice it.

00:11:38.470 --> 00:11:41.086
But that characterization
of seawater desalination

00:11:41.110 --> 00:11:44.126
as being a nonstarter
is hopelessly out of date.

00:11:44.150 --> 00:11:46.926
We've made tremendous progress
in seawater desalination

00:11:46.950 --> 00:11:48.190
in the past two decades.

00:11:49.070 --> 00:11:50.726
This picture shows you

00:11:50.750 --> 00:11:54.726
the largest seawater desalination plant
in the Western hemisphere

00:11:54.750 --> 00:11:57.566
that's currently being built
north of San Diego.

00:11:57.590 --> 00:11:59.846
Compared to the seawater
desalination plant

00:11:59.870 --> 00:12:03.166
that was built in
Santa Barbara 25 years ago,

00:12:03.190 --> 00:12:05.846
this treatment plant
will use about half the energy

00:12:05.870 --> 00:12:07.390
to produce a gallon of water.

00:12:07.990 --> 00:12:11.726
But just because seawater desalination
has become less energy-intensive,

00:12:11.750 --> 00:12:14.989
doesn't mean we should start building
desalination plants everywhere.

00:12:15.013 --> 00:12:16.749
Among the different choices we have,

00:12:16.773 --> 00:12:18.886
it's probably the most energy-intensive

00:12:18.910 --> 00:12:20.846
and potentially environmentally damaging

00:12:20.870 --> 00:12:23.790
of the options to create
a local water supply.

00:12:24.710 --> 00:12:25.926
So there it is.

00:12:25.950 --> 00:12:27.726
With these four sources of water,

00:12:27.750 --> 00:12:31.070
we can move away
from our reliance on imported water.

00:12:31.830 --> 00:12:36.326
Through reform in the way we landscape
our surfaces and our properties,

00:12:36.350 --> 00:12:39.446
we can reduce outdoor water use
by about 50 percent,

00:12:39.470 --> 00:12:42.926
thereby increasing 
the water supply by 25 percent.

00:12:42.950 --> 00:12:45.474
We can recycle the water
that makes it into the sewer,

00:12:45.498 --> 00:12:48.578
thereby increasing
our water supply by 40 percent.

00:12:49.030 --> 00:12:51.646
And we can make up the difference
through a combination

00:12:51.670 --> 00:12:54.150
of stormwater harvesting
and seawater desalination.

00:12:55.430 --> 00:12:59.246
So, let's create a water supply

00:12:59.270 --> 00:13:02.926
that will be able
to withstand any of the challenges

00:13:02.950 --> 00:13:05.526
that climate change throws at us
in the coming years.

00:13:05.550 --> 00:13:08.886
Let's create a water supply
that uses local sources

00:13:08.910 --> 00:13:12.950
and leaves more water
in the environment for fish and for food.

00:13:13.790 --> 00:13:18.806
Let's create a water system that's
consistent with out environmental values.

00:13:18.830 --> 00:13:22.286
And let's do it for our children
and our grandchildren

00:13:22.310 --> 00:13:24.926
and let's tell them this is the system

00:13:24.950 --> 00:13:27.286
that they have to
take care of in the future

00:13:27.310 --> 00:13:31.246
because it's our last chance
to create a new kind of water system.

00:13:31.270 --> 00:13:33.128
Thank you very much for your attention.

00:13:33.152 --> 00:13:36.072
