WEBVTT

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:14.550
Democracy.

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:16.446
In the West,

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.406
we make a colossal mistake
taking it for granted.

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:21.726
We see democracy

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:26.246
not as the most fragile
of flowers that it really is,

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:29.110
but we see it as part
of our society's furniture.

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:34.110
We tend to think of it
as an intransigent given.

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:40.046
We mistakenly believe that capitalism
begets inevitably democracy.

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:41.406
It doesn't.

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.806
Singapore's Lee Kuan Yew
and his great imitators in Beijing

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:48.766
have demonstrated beyond reasonable doubt

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:52.686
that it is perfectly possible
to have a flourishing capitalism,

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.310
spectacular growth,

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:58.166
while politics remains democracy-free.

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:02.606
Indeed, democracy is receding
in our neck of the woods,

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:04.206
here in Europe.

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:07.606
Earlier this year,
while I was representing Greece --

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:10.366
the newly elected Greek government --

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:13.086
in the Eurogroup as its Finance Minister,

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:18.046
I was told in no uncertain terms
that our nation's democratic process --

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:19.486
our elections --

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:21.286
could not be allowed to interfere

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:24.550
with economic policies
that were being implemented in Greece.

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:26.486
At that moment,

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:30.806
I felt that there could be no greater
vindication of Lee Kuan Yew,

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:32.366
or the Chinese Communist Party,

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:36.126
indeed of some recalcitrant
friends of mine who kept telling me

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:40.470
that democracy would be banned
if it ever threatened to change anything.

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:45.046
Tonight, here, I want to present to you

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:48.230
an economic case
for an authentic democracy.

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:53.606
I want to ask you
to join me in believing again

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:55.630
that Lee Kuan Yew,

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:58.006
the Chinese Communist Party

00:01:58.030 --> 00:01:59.406
and indeed the Eurogroup

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:03.070
are wrong in believing
that we can dispense with democracy --

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:07.486
that we need an authentic,
boisterous democracy.

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:10.486
And without democracy,

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:13.366
our societies will be nastier,

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:15.526
our future bleak

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:18.366
and our great, new technologies wasted.

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:19.646
Speaking of waste,

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:22.445
allow me to point out
an interesting paradox

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:25.246
that is threatening
our economies as we speak.

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:27.566
I call it the twin peaks paradox.

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:28.886
One peak you understand --

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:30.526
you know it, you recognize it --

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:35.606
is the mountain of debts
that has been casting a long shadow

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:38.446
over the United States,
Europe, the whole world.

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:40.350
We all recognize the mountain of debts.

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:45.150
But few people discern its twin.

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:47.990
A mountain of idle cash

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:52.350
belonging to rich savers
and to corporations,

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:55.846
too terrified to invest it

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:59.166
into the productive activities
that can generate the incomes

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:02.246
from which you can extinguish
the mountain of debts

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:06.246
and which can produce all those things
that humanity desperately needs,

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:07.926
like green energy.

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:10.286
Now let me give you two numbers.

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:11.646
Over the last three months,

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:14.446
in the United States,
in Britain and in the Eurozone,

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:18.886
we have invested, collectively,
3.4 trillion dollars

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:21.566
on all the wealth-producing goods --

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:24.606
things like industrial plants, machinery,

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:26.846
office blocks, schools,

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:30.006
roads, railways, machinery,
and so on and so forth.

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:32.766
$3.4 trillion sounds like a lot of money

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:36.646
until you compare it to the $5.1 trillion

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:39.366
that has been slushing around
in the same countries,

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:41.206
in our financial institutions,

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:44.430
doing absolutely nothing
during the same period

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:50.446
except inflating stock exchanges
and bidding up house prices.

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:55.726
So a mountain of debt
and a mountain of idle cash

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:59.446
form twin peaks, 
failing to cancel each other out

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:02.286
through the normal
operation of the markets.

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:04.630
The result is stagnant wages,

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:11.166
more than a quarter of 25- to 54-year-olds
in America, in Japan and in Europe

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:12.686
out of work.

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:15.046
And consequently, low aggregate demand,

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:17.286
which in a never-ending cycle,

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:20.030
reinforces the pessimism of the investors,

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:24.846
who, fearing low demand,
reproduce it by not investing --

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:27.566
exactly like Oedipus' father,

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:30.085
who, terrified
by the prophecy of the oracle

00:04:30.109 --> 00:04:32.846
that his son would grow up to kill him,

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:34.806
unwittingly engineered the conditions

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:37.830
that ensured that Oedipus,
his son, would kill him.

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:40.710
This is my quarrel with capitalism.

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:43.366
Its gross wastefulness,

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:45.006
all this idle cash,

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:49.126
should be energized to improve lives,

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:50.486
to develop human talents,

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:53.366
and indeed to finance
all these technologies,

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:54.646
green technologies,

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:57.430
which are absolutely essential
for saving planet Earth.

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:01.686
Am I right in believing
that democracy might be the answer?

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:02.926
I believe so,

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:04.166
but before we move on,

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:05.590
what do we mean by democracy?

00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:09.086
Aristotle defined democracy

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:14.046
as the constitution
in which the free and the poor,

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:16.230
being in the majority, control government.

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:20.446
Now, of course Athenian democracy
excluded too many.

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:23.510
Women, migrants and,
of course, the slaves.

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:25.446
But it would be a mistake

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:29.046
to dismiss the significance
of ancient Athenian democracy

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:31.070
on the basis of whom it excluded.

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:33.086
What was more pertinent,

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:36.966
and continues to be so
about ancient Athenian democracy,

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:40.486
was the inclusion of the working poor,

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:45.206
who not only acquired
the right to free speech,

00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:47.486
but more importantly, crucially,

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:50.126
they acquired the rights
to political judgments

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:52.526
that were afforded equal weight

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:56.206
in the decision-making
concerning matters of state.

00:05:56.230 --> 00:05:59.286
Now, of course, Athenian
democracy didn't last long.

00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:03.726
Like a candle that burns brightly,
it burned out quickly.

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:04.966
And indeed,

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:09.246
our liberal democracies today
do not have their roots in ancient Athens.

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:11.606
They have their roots in the Magna Carta,

00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:14.886
in the 1688 Glorious Revolution,

00:06:14.910 --> 00:06:17.126
indeed in the American constitution.

00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:22.166
Whereas Athenian democracy
was focusing on the masterless citizen

00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:24.470
and empowering the working poor,

00:06:25.390 --> 00:06:29.566
our liberal democracies are founded
on the Magna Carta tradition,

00:06:29.590 --> 00:06:32.686
which was, after all,
a charter for masters.

00:06:32.710 --> 00:06:37.006
And indeed, liberal democracy
only surfaced when it was possible

00:06:37.030 --> 00:06:40.886
to separate fully the political sphere
from the economic sphere,

00:06:40.910 --> 00:06:45.966
so as to confine the democratic process
fully in the political sphere,

00:06:45.990 --> 00:06:47.846
leaving the economic sphere --

00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:49.806
the corporate world, if you want --

00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:52.510
as a democracy-free zone.

00:06:53.870 --> 00:06:56.846
Now, in our democracies today,

00:06:56.870 --> 00:07:00.366
this separation of the economic
from the political sphere,

00:07:00.390 --> 00:07:02.646
the moment it started happening,

00:07:02.670 --> 00:07:06.966
it gave rise to an inexorable,
epic struggle between the two,

00:07:06.990 --> 00:07:10.206
with the economic sphere
colonizing the political sphere,

00:07:10.230 --> 00:07:11.750
eating into its power.

00:07:12.630 --> 00:07:16.030
Have you wondered why politicians
are not what they used to be?

00:07:16.710 --> 00:07:19.126
It's not because their DNA
has degenerated.

00:07:19.150 --> 00:07:20.766
(Laughter)

00:07:20.790 --> 00:07:25.406
It is rather because one can be
in government today and not in power,

00:07:25.430 --> 00:07:28.726
because power has migrated
from the political to the economic sphere,

00:07:28.750 --> 00:07:29.990
which is separate.

00:07:31.310 --> 00:07:32.886
Indeed,

00:07:32.910 --> 00:07:35.206
I spoke about my quarrel
with capitalism.

00:07:35.230 --> 00:07:36.966
If you think about it,

00:07:36.990 --> 00:07:40.310
it is a little bit like
a population of predators,

00:07:41.230 --> 00:07:45.950
that are so successful in decimating
the prey that they must feed on,

00:07:46.710 --> 00:07:48.846
that in the end they starve.

00:07:48.870 --> 00:07:50.086
Similarly,

00:07:50.110 --> 00:07:53.806
the economic sphere has been colonizing
and cannibalizing the political sphere

00:07:53.830 --> 00:07:57.206
to such an extent
that it is undermining itself,

00:07:57.230 --> 00:07:58.966
causing economic crisis.

00:07:58.990 --> 00:08:01.086
Corporate power is increasing,

00:08:01.110 --> 00:08:03.326
political goods are devaluing,

00:08:03.350 --> 00:08:05.166
inequality is rising,

00:08:05.190 --> 00:08:06.766
aggregate demand is falling

00:08:06.790 --> 00:08:12.910
and CEOs of corporations are too scared
to invest the cash of their corporations.

00:08:13.670 --> 00:08:20.326
So the more capitalism succeeds
in taking the demos out of democracy,

00:08:20.350 --> 00:08:21.686
the taller the twin peaks

00:08:21.710 --> 00:08:25.246
and the greater the waste
of human resources

00:08:25.270 --> 00:08:26.710
and humanity's wealth.

00:08:27.790 --> 00:08:30.646
Clearly, if this is right,

00:08:30.670 --> 00:08:33.726
we must reunite the political
and economic spheres

00:08:33.750 --> 00:08:37.246
and better do it
with a demos being in control,

00:08:37.270 --> 00:08:40.206
like in ancient Athens
except without the slaves

00:08:40.230 --> 00:08:43.190
or the exclusion of women and migrants.

00:08:44.270 --> 00:08:46.006
Now, this is not an original idea.

00:08:46.030 --> 00:08:48.805
The Marxist left
had that idea 100 years ago

00:08:48.829 --> 00:08:50.510
and it didn't go very well, did it?

00:08:50.990 --> 00:08:54.406
The lesson that we learned
from the Soviet debacle

00:08:54.430 --> 00:09:00.766
is that only by a miracle
will the working poor be reempowered,

00:09:00.790 --> 00:09:02.766
as they were in ancient Athens,

00:09:02.790 --> 00:09:06.550
without creating new forms
of brutality and waste.

00:09:07.110 --> 00:09:08.350
But there is a solution:

00:09:09.030 --> 00:09:10.870
eliminate the working poor.

00:09:11.510 --> 00:09:12.766
Capitalism's doing it

00:09:12.790 --> 00:09:17.670
by replacing low-wage workers
with automata, androids, robots.

00:09:19.230 --> 00:09:20.446
The problem is

00:09:20.470 --> 00:09:23.686
that as long as the economic
and the political spheres are separate,

00:09:23.710 --> 00:09:28.030
automation makes the twin peaks taller,

00:09:28.790 --> 00:09:30.526
the waste loftier

00:09:30.550 --> 00:09:32.606
and the social conflicts deeper,

00:09:32.630 --> 00:09:33.830
including --

00:09:34.470 --> 00:09:36.006
soon, I believe --

00:09:36.030 --> 00:09:37.630
in places like China.

00:09:38.870 --> 00:09:41.286
So we need to reconfigure,

00:09:41.310 --> 00:09:44.966
we need to reunite the economic
and the political spheres,

00:09:44.990 --> 00:09:50.366
but we'd better do it
by democratizing the reunified sphere,

00:09:50.390 --> 00:09:56.086
lest we end up with
a surveillance-mad hyperautocracy

00:09:56.110 --> 00:10:00.126
that makes The Matrix, the movie,
look like a documentary.

00:10:00.150 --> 00:10:01.726
(Laughter)

00:10:01.750 --> 00:10:05.166
So the question is not
whether capitalism will survive

00:10:05.190 --> 00:10:07.510
the technological innovations
it is spawning.

00:10:08.110 --> 00:10:09.726
The more interesting question

00:10:09.750 --> 00:10:15.486
is whether capitalism will be succeeded
by something resembling a Matrix dystopia

00:10:15.510 --> 00:10:19.926
or something much closer
to a Star Trek-like society,

00:10:19.950 --> 00:10:22.326
where machines serve the humans

00:10:22.350 --> 00:10:26.766
and the humans expend their energies
exploring the universe

00:10:26.790 --> 00:10:31.086
and indulging in long debates
about the meaning of life

00:10:31.110 --> 00:10:35.110
in some ancient, Athenian-like,
high tech agora.

00:10:36.510 --> 00:10:39.950
I think we can afford to be optimistic.

00:10:41.550 --> 00:10:42.846
But what would it take,

00:10:42.870 --> 00:10:44.846
what would it look like

00:10:44.870 --> 00:10:49.750
to have this Star Trek-like utopia,
instead of the Matrix-like dystopia?

00:10:50.390 --> 00:10:51.646
In practical terms,

00:10:51.670 --> 00:10:53.406
allow me to share just briefly,

00:10:53.430 --> 00:10:54.630
a couple of examples.

00:10:55.230 --> 00:10:57.006
At the level of the enterprise,

00:10:57.030 --> 00:10:59.366
imagine a capital market,

00:10:59.390 --> 00:11:02.070
where you earn capital as you work,

00:11:03.030 --> 00:11:08.366
and where your capital follows you
from one job to another,

00:11:08.390 --> 00:11:09.886
from one company to another,

00:11:09.910 --> 00:11:11.166
and the company --

00:11:11.190 --> 00:11:14.646
whichever one you happen
to work at at that time --

00:11:14.670 --> 00:11:18.990
is solely owned by those who happen
to work in it at that moment.

00:11:19.550 --> 00:11:24.246
Then all income stems
from capital, from profits,

00:11:24.270 --> 00:11:28.646
and the very concept
of wage labor becomes obsolete.

00:11:28.670 --> 00:11:35.286
No more separation between those
who own but do not work in the company

00:11:35.310 --> 00:11:38.566
and those who work
but do not own the company;

00:11:38.590 --> 00:11:41.790
no more tug-of-war
between capital and labor;

00:11:42.590 --> 00:11:46.726
no great gap between
investment and saving;

00:11:46.750 --> 00:11:49.990
indeed, no towering twin peaks.

00:11:50.750 --> 00:11:53.126
At the level of the global
political economy,

00:11:53.150 --> 00:11:55.086
imagine for a moment

00:11:55.110 --> 00:12:00.086
that our national currencies
have a free-floating exchange rate,

00:12:00.110 --> 00:12:03.886
with a universal,
global, digital currency,

00:12:03.910 --> 00:12:07.926
one that is issued
by the International Monetary Fund,

00:12:07.950 --> 00:12:09.166
the G-20,

00:12:09.190 --> 00:12:11.726
on behalf of all humanity.

00:12:11.750 --> 00:12:12.966
And imagine further

00:12:12.990 --> 00:12:17.326
that all international trade
is denominated in this currency --

00:12:17.350 --> 00:12:19.166
let's call it "the cosmos,"

00:12:19.190 --> 00:12:20.590
in units of cosmos --

00:12:21.870 --> 00:12:26.246
with every government agreeing
to be paying into a common fund

00:12:26.270 --> 00:12:31.806
a sum of cosmos units proportional
to the country's trade deficit,

00:12:31.830 --> 00:12:35.230
or indeed to a country's trade surplus.

00:12:35.870 --> 00:12:41.086
And imagine that that fund is utilized
to invest in green technologies,

00:12:41.110 --> 00:12:46.430
especially in parts of the world
where investment funding is scarce.

00:12:46.990 --> 00:12:48.566
This is not a new idea.

00:12:48.590 --> 00:12:51.926
It's what, effectively,
John Maynard Keynes proposed

00:12:51.950 --> 00:12:55.270
in 1944 at the Bretton Woods Conference.

00:12:56.230 --> 00:12:57.446
The problem is

00:12:57.470 --> 00:13:00.766
that back then, they didn't have
the technology to implement it.

00:13:00.790 --> 00:13:02.006
Now we do,

00:13:02.030 --> 00:13:07.950
especially in the context
of a reunified political-economic sphere.

00:13:08.790 --> 00:13:11.206
The world that I am describing to you

00:13:11.230 --> 00:13:13.686
is simultaneously libertarian,

00:13:13.710 --> 00:13:18.286
in that it prioritizes
empowered individuals,

00:13:18.310 --> 00:13:19.526
Marxist,

00:13:19.550 --> 00:13:22.766
since it will have confined
to the dustbin of history

00:13:22.790 --> 00:13:25.246
the division between capital and labor,

00:13:25.270 --> 00:13:26.830
and Keynesian,

00:13:27.470 --> 00:13:28.950
global Keynesian.

00:13:30.470 --> 00:13:32.046
But above all else,

00:13:32.070 --> 00:13:36.990
it is a world in which we will be able
to imagine an authentic democracy.

00:13:37.910 --> 00:13:39.670
Will such a world dawn?

00:13:40.550 --> 00:13:45.046
Or shall we descend
into a Matrix-like dystopia?

00:13:45.070 --> 00:13:49.190
The answer lies in the political choice
that we shall be making collectively.

00:13:49.870 --> 00:13:51.486
It is our choice,

00:13:51.510 --> 00:13:53.830
and we'd better make it democratically.

00:13:54.430 --> 00:13:55.686
Thank you.

00:13:55.710 --> 00:13:59.070
(Applause)

00:14:01.630 --> 00:14:02.830
Bruno Giussani: Yanis ...

00:14:04.030 --> 00:14:08.470
It was you who described yourself
in your bios as a libertarian Marxist.

00:14:10.550 --> 00:14:13.070
What is the relevance
of Marx's analysis today?

00:14:14.150 --> 00:14:17.486
Yanis Varoufakis: Well, if there was
any relevance in what I just said,

00:14:17.510 --> 00:14:18.726
then Marx is relevant.

00:14:18.750 --> 00:14:22.246
Because the whole point of reunifying
the political and economic is --

00:14:22.270 --> 00:14:23.486
if we don't do it,

00:14:23.510 --> 00:14:25.766
then technological innovation
is going to create

00:14:25.790 --> 00:14:28.086
such a massive fall in aggregate demand,

00:14:28.110 --> 00:14:32.886
what Larry Summers
refers to as secular stagnation.

00:14:32.910 --> 00:14:35.766
With this crisis migrating
from one part of the world,

00:14:35.790 --> 00:14:37.326
as it is now,

00:14:37.350 --> 00:14:40.046
it will destabilize
not only our democracies,

00:14:40.070 --> 00:14:44.286
but even the emerging world that is not
that keen on liberal democracy.

00:14:44.310 --> 00:14:48.126
So if this analysis holds water,
then Marx is absolutely relevant.

00:14:48.150 --> 00:14:49.886
But so is Hayek,

00:14:49.910 --> 00:14:51.726
that's why I'm a libertarian Marxist,

00:14:51.750 --> 00:14:52.966
and so is Keynes,

00:14:52.990 --> 00:14:54.886
so that's why I'm totally confused.

00:14:54.910 --> 00:14:56.126
(Laughter)

00:14:56.150 --> 00:14:58.206
BG: Indeed, and possibly we are too, now.

00:14:58.230 --> 00:14:59.526
(Laughter)

00:14:59.550 --> 00:15:01.526
(Applause)

00:15:01.550 --> 00:15:04.326
YV: If you are not confused,
you are not thinking, OK?

00:15:04.350 --> 00:15:07.446
BG: That's a very, very Greek
philosopher kind of thing to say --

00:15:07.470 --> 00:15:09.126
YV: That was Einstein, actually --

00:15:09.150 --> 00:15:11.766
BG: During your talk
you mentioned Singapore and China,

00:15:11.790 --> 00:15:13.846
and last night at the speaker dinner,

00:15:13.870 --> 00:15:19.046
you expressed a pretty strong opinion
about how the West looks at China.

00:15:19.070 --> 00:15:20.646
Would you like to share that?

00:15:20.670 --> 00:15:22.830
YV: Well, there's a great
degree of hypocrisy.

00:15:23.550 --> 00:15:27.846
In our liberal democracies,
we have a semblance of democracy.

00:15:27.870 --> 00:15:30.606
It's because we have confined,
as I was saying in my talk,

00:15:30.630 --> 00:15:32.286
democracy to the political sphere,

00:15:32.310 --> 00:15:35.766
while leaving the one sphere
where all the action is --

00:15:35.790 --> 00:15:37.006
the economic sphere --

00:15:37.030 --> 00:15:38.870
a completely democracy-free zone.

00:15:39.430 --> 00:15:40.686
In a sense,

00:15:40.710 --> 00:15:42.910
if I am allowed to be provocative,

00:15:44.030 --> 00:15:48.446
China today is closer to Britain
in the 19th century.

00:15:48.470 --> 00:15:49.726
Because remember,

00:15:49.750 --> 00:15:52.086
we tend to associate
liberalism with democracy --

00:15:52.110 --> 00:15:53.606
that's a mistake, historically.

00:15:53.630 --> 00:15:56.166
Liberalism, liberal,
it's like John Stuart Mill.

00:15:56.190 --> 00:16:00.886
John Stuart Mill was particularly
skeptical about the democratic process.

00:16:00.910 --> 00:16:06.286
So what you are seeing now in China
is a very similar process

00:16:06.310 --> 00:16:09.486
to the one that we had in Britain
during the Industrial Revolution,

00:16:09.510 --> 00:16:12.486
especially the transition
from the first to the second.

00:16:12.510 --> 00:16:15.806
And to be castigating China

00:16:15.830 --> 00:16:18.966
for doing that which the West did
in the 19th century,

00:16:18.990 --> 00:16:20.310
smacks of hypocrisy.

00:16:21.670 --> 00:16:25.326
BG: I am sure that many people here
are wondering about your experience

00:16:25.350 --> 00:16:28.086
as the Finance Minister of Greece
earlier this year.

00:16:28.110 --> 00:16:29.491
YV: I knew this was coming.

00:16:29.515 --> 00:16:30.766
BG: Yes.

00:16:30.790 --> 00:16:32.126
BG: Six months after,

00:16:32.150 --> 00:16:34.550
how do you look back
at the first half of the year?

00:16:36.070 --> 00:16:38.686
YV: Extremely exciting,
from a personal point of view,

00:16:38.710 --> 00:16:39.966
and very disappointing,

00:16:39.990 --> 00:16:43.886
because we had an opportunity
to reboot the Eurozone.

00:16:43.910 --> 00:16:46.006
Not just Greece, the Eurozone.

00:16:46.030 --> 00:16:48.966
To move away from the complacency

00:16:48.990 --> 00:16:51.446
and the constant denial
that there was a massive --

00:16:51.470 --> 00:16:54.326
and there is a massive
architectural fault line

00:16:54.350 --> 00:16:56.526
going through the Eurozone,

00:16:56.550 --> 00:17:00.966
which is threatening, massively,
the whole of the European Union process.

00:17:00.990 --> 00:17:04.166
We had an opportunity
on the basis of the Greek program --

00:17:04.190 --> 00:17:05.526
which by the way,

00:17:05.550 --> 00:17:09.926
was the first program
to manifest that denial --

00:17:09.950 --> 00:17:11.166
to put it right.

00:17:11.190 --> 00:17:12.406
And, unfortunately,

00:17:12.430 --> 00:17:14.246
the powers in the Eurozone,

00:17:14.270 --> 00:17:15.470
in the Eurogroup,

00:17:16.229 --> 00:17:18.206
chose to maintain denial.

00:17:18.229 --> 00:17:19.486
But you know what happens.

00:17:19.509 --> 00:17:21.565
This is the experience
of the Soviet Union.

00:17:21.590 --> 00:17:24.085
When you try to keep alive

00:17:24.110 --> 00:17:27.989
an economic system
that architecturally cannot survive,

00:17:28.670 --> 00:17:31.325
through political will
and through authoritarianism,

00:17:31.350 --> 00:17:33.006
you may succeed in prolonging it,

00:17:33.030 --> 00:17:34.605
but when change happens

00:17:34.630 --> 00:17:37.126
it happens very abruptly
and catastrophically.

00:17:37.150 --> 00:17:39.157
BG: What kind of change
are you foreseeing?

00:17:39.181 --> 00:17:40.435
YV: Well, there's no doubt

00:17:40.459 --> 00:17:43.126
that if we don't change
the architecture of the Eurozone,

00:17:43.151 --> 00:17:45.045
the Eurozone has no future.

00:17:45.070 --> 00:17:47.966
BG: Did you make any mistakes
when you were Finance Minister?

00:17:47.990 --> 00:17:49.206
YV: Every day.

00:17:49.230 --> 00:17:51.766
BG: For example?
YV: Anybody who looks back --

00:17:51.790 --> 00:17:53.870
(Applause)

00:17:56.270 --> 00:17:57.646
No, but seriously.

00:17:57.670 --> 00:18:01.246
If there's any Minister of Finance,
or of anything else for that matter,

00:18:01.270 --> 00:18:03.486
who tells you after six months in a job,

00:18:03.510 --> 00:18:07.206
especially in such a stressful situation,

00:18:07.230 --> 00:18:09.926
that they have made no mistake,
they're dangerous people.

00:18:09.950 --> 00:18:11.246
Of course I made mistakes.

00:18:11.270 --> 00:18:14.086
The greatest mistake
was to sign the application

00:18:14.110 --> 00:18:16.206
for the extension of a loan agreement

00:18:16.230 --> 00:18:17.846
in the end of February.

00:18:17.870 --> 00:18:19.086
I was imagining

00:18:19.110 --> 00:18:22.086
that there was a genuine interest
on the side of the creditors

00:18:22.110 --> 00:18:23.366
to find common ground.

00:18:23.390 --> 00:18:24.606
And there wasn't.

00:18:24.630 --> 00:18:27.246
They were simply interested
in crushing our government,

00:18:27.270 --> 00:18:28.726
just because they did not want

00:18:28.750 --> 00:18:31.886
to have to deal with
the architectural fault lines

00:18:31.910 --> 00:18:33.926
that were running through the Eurozone.

00:18:33.950 --> 00:18:35.766
And because they didn't want to admit

00:18:35.790 --> 00:18:39.406
that for five years they were implementing
a catastrophic program in Greece.

00:18:39.430 --> 00:18:42.326
We lost one-third of our nominal GDP.

00:18:42.350 --> 00:18:44.286
This is worse than the Great Depression.

00:18:44.310 --> 00:18:45.566
And no one has come clean

00:18:45.590 --> 00:18:48.526
from the troika of lenders
that have been imposing this policy

00:18:48.550 --> 00:18:51.526
to say, "This was a colossal mistake."

00:18:51.550 --> 00:18:52.766
BG: Despite all this,

00:18:52.790 --> 00:18:55.126
and despite the aggressiveness
of the discussion,

00:18:55.150 --> 00:18:57.566
you seem to be remaining
quite pro-European.

00:18:57.590 --> 00:18:58.806
YV: Absolutely.

00:18:58.830 --> 00:19:02.966
Look, my criticism
of the European Union and the Eurozone

00:19:02.990 --> 00:19:07.030
comes from a person
who lives and breathes Europe.

00:19:07.830 --> 00:19:11.406
My greatest fear is that
the Eurozone will not survive.

00:19:11.430 --> 00:19:12.886
Because if it doesn't,

00:19:12.910 --> 00:19:15.766
the centrifugal forces
that will be unleashed

00:19:15.790 --> 00:19:17.486
will be demonic,

00:19:17.510 --> 00:19:19.486
and they will destroy the European Union.

00:19:19.510 --> 00:19:21.926
And that will be catastrophic
not just for Europe

00:19:21.950 --> 00:19:23.566
but for the whole global economy.

00:19:23.590 --> 00:19:27.686
We are probably the largest
economy in the world.

00:19:27.710 --> 00:19:29.446
And if we allow ourselves

00:19:29.470 --> 00:19:32.286
to fall into a route
of the postmodern 1930's,

00:19:32.310 --> 00:19:34.966
which seems to me to be what we are doing,

00:19:34.990 --> 00:19:36.806
then that will be detrimental

00:19:36.830 --> 00:19:40.246
to the future of Europeans
and non-Europeans alike.

00:19:40.270 --> 00:19:42.686
BG: We definitely hope
you are wrong on that point.

00:19:42.710 --> 00:19:44.406
Yanis, thank you for coming to TED.

00:19:44.430 --> 00:19:45.646
YV: Thank you.

00:19:45.670 --> 00:19:50.493
(Applause)
