00:00:13.509 --> 00:00:18.606
Our ability to create
and sustain economic growth

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:21.366
is the defining challenge of our time.

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:23.926
Of course there are other challenges --

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:27.086
health care, disease burdens
and pandemics,

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:28.910
environmental challenges

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.230
and, of course, radicalized terrorism.

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:34.166
However,

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:38.766
to the extent that we can actually
solve the economic growth challenge,

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.126
it will take us a long way

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:42.750
to solving the challenges
that I've just elucidated.

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:45.206
More importantly,

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:49.726
unless and until we solve economic growth

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:53.766
and create sustainable,
long-term economic growth,

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:56.206
we'll be unable to address

00:00:56.230 --> 00:01:01.566
the seemingly intractable challenges
that continue to pervade the globe today,

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:05.990
whether it's health care,
education or economic development.

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:09.030
The fundamental question is this:

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:12.286
How are we going to create economic growth

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:16.886
in advanced and developed economies
like the United States and across Europe

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:18.966
at a time when they continue to struggle

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.790
to create economic growth
after the financial crisis?

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:25.406
They continue to underperform

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:29.550
and to see an erosion in the three
key drivers of economic growth:

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:33.510
capital, labor and productivity.

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:35.726
In particular,

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:40.686
these developed economies
continue to see debts and deficits,

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:45.566
the decline and erosion
of both the quality and quantity of labor

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:47.870
and they also see productivity stalling.

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.446
In a similar vein,

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:53.886
how are we going to create
economic growth in the emerging markets,

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:57.166
where 90 percent
of the world's population lives

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:58.726
and where, on average,

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:02.270
70 percent of the population
is under the age of 25?

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:04.246
In these countries,

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:08.446
it is essential that they grow
at a minimum of seven percent a year

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:10.566
in order to put a dent in poverty

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:13.790
and to double per capita incomes
in one generation.

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:16.726
And yet today,

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:18.846
the largest emerging economies --

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:21.566
countries with at least
50 million people --

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:25.070
continue to struggle to reach
that seven percent magic mark.

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:27.126
Worse than that,

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:31.766
countries like India, Russia,
South Africa, Brazil and even China

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:34.286
are falling below
that seven percent number

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:37.150
and, in many cases, actually regressing.

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:39.870
Economic growth matters.

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:42.046
With economic growth,

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:46.246
countries and societies
enter into a virtuous cycle

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:50.870
of upward mobility, opportunity
and improved living standards.

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:55.206
Without growth,
countries contract and atrophy,

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:58.446
not just in the annals
of economic statistics

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:01.990
but also in the meaning of life
and how lives are lived.

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:06.470
Economic growth matters
powerfully for the individual.

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:08.886
If growth wanes,

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:10.926
the risk to human progress

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:15.366
and the risk of political
and social instability rises,

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:19.950
and societies become dimmer,
coarser and smaller.

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:22.446
The context matters.

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:24.086
And countries in emerging markets

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:27.950
do not need to grow at the same
rates as developed countries.

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:33.830
Now, I know some of you in this room
find this to be a risky proposition.

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:36.686
There are some people here

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:39.246
who will turn around
and be quite disillusioned

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:41.046
by what's happened around the world

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:43.670
and basically ascribe that
to economic growth.

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:47.886
You worry about the
overpopulation of the planet.

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:50.806
And looking at the UN's
recent statistics and projections

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:53.526
that the world will have
11 billion people on the planet

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:56.126
before it plateaus in 2100,

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:59.966
you're concerned about what that does
to natural resources --

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:04.110
arable land, potable water,
energy and minerals.

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:08.270
You are also concerned about
the degradation of the environment.

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:12.046
And you worry about how man,

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:14.686
embodied in the corporate globalist,

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:17.750
has become greedy and corrupt.

00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:22.086
But I'm here to tell you today
that economic growth

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:25.486
has been the backbone
of changes in living standards

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:27.470
of millions of people around the world.

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:29.926
And more importantly,

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:34.430
it's not just economic growth
that has been driven by capitalism.

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:39.886
The definition of capitalism,
very simply put,

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:41.966
is that the factors of production,

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:45.366
such as trade and industry,
capital and labor,

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:49.310
are left in the hands
of the private sector and not the state.

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:52.566
It's really essential here
that we understand

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:57.606
that fundamentally the critique
is not for economic growth per se

00:04:57.630 --> 00:04:59.686
but what has happened to capitalism.

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:03.726
And to the extent that we need to create
economic growth over the long term,

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:08.430
we're going to have to pursue it
with a better form of economic stance.

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:12.366
Economic growth needs capitalism,

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:14.070
but it needs it to work properly.

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:17.286
And as I mentioned a moment ago,

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:23.270
the core of the capitalist system
has been defined by private actors.

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:27.926
And even this, however,
is a very simplistic dichotomy.

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:30.870
Capitalism: good; non-capitalism: bad.

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:33.926
When in practical experience,

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:36.406
capitalism is much more of a spectrum.

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:38.686
And we have countries such as China,

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:41.126
which have practiced
more state capitalism,

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:43.246
and we have countries
like the Unites States

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:44.870
which are more market capitalist.

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:48.446
Our efforts to critique
the capitalist system, however,

00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:51.686
have tended to focus
on countries like China

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:55.110
that are in fact
not blatantly market capitalism.

00:05:55.750 --> 00:05:59.406
However, there is
a real reason and real concern

00:05:59.430 --> 00:06:04.086
for us to now focus our attentions
on purer forms of capitalism,

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:06.830
particularly those embodied
by the United States.

00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:09.206
This is really important

00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:11.686
because this type of capitalism

00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:14.966
has increasingly
been afforded the critique

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:17.406
that it is now fostering corruption

00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:18.806
and, worse still,

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:21.470
it's increasing income inequality --

00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:26.990
the idea that the few are benefiting
at the expense of the many.

00:06:28.910 --> 00:06:32.126
The two really critical questions
that we need to address

00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:34.846
is how can we fix capitalism

00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:37.646
so that it can help create economic growth

00:06:37.670 --> 00:06:41.030
but at the same time
can help to address social ills.

00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:45.246
In order to think about that framing,
we have to ask ourselves,

00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:46.990
how does capitalism work today?

00:06:47.910 --> 00:06:49.510
Very simplistically,

00:06:50.110 --> 00:06:55.886
capitalism is set on the basis
of an individual utility maximizer --

00:06:55.910 --> 00:07:00.206
a selfish individual
who goes after what he or she wants.

00:07:00.230 --> 00:07:03.366
And only after they've
maximized their utility

00:07:03.390 --> 00:07:05.886
do they then decide it's important

00:07:05.910 --> 00:07:08.990
to provide support
to other social contracts.

00:07:09.510 --> 00:07:12.926
Of course, in this system
governments do tax,

00:07:12.950 --> 00:07:16.686
and they use part of their revenues
to fund social programs,

00:07:16.710 --> 00:07:19.566
recognizing that government's role
is not just regulation

00:07:19.590 --> 00:07:22.870
but also to be arbiter of social goods.

00:07:23.470 --> 00:07:24.766
But nevertheless,

00:07:24.790 --> 00:07:26.126
this framework --

00:07:26.150 --> 00:07:28.126
this two-stage framework --

00:07:28.150 --> 00:07:30.126
is the basis from which we must now start

00:07:30.150 --> 00:07:32.750
to think about how we can
improve the capitalist model.

00:07:33.670 --> 00:07:37.070
I would argue that there are
two sides to this challenge.

00:07:37.670 --> 00:07:38.886
First of all,

00:07:38.910 --> 00:07:41.846
we can draw on the right-wing policies

00:07:41.870 --> 00:07:43.726
to see what could be beneficial for us

00:07:43.750 --> 00:07:45.870
to think about how
we can improve capitalism.

00:07:46.590 --> 00:07:47.846
In particular,

00:07:47.870 --> 00:07:49.606
right-leaning policies

00:07:49.630 --> 00:07:53.086
have tended to focus on things
like conditional transfers,

00:07:53.110 --> 00:07:56.126
where we pay and reward people
for doing the things

00:07:56.150 --> 00:07:59.606
that we actually think
can help enhance economic growth.

00:07:59.630 --> 00:08:00.846
For example,

00:08:00.870 --> 00:08:02.486
sending children to school,

00:08:02.510 --> 00:08:04.726
parents could earn money for that,

00:08:04.750 --> 00:08:08.126
or getting their children
inoculated or immunized,

00:08:08.150 --> 00:08:10.030
parents could get paid for doing that.

00:08:10.510 --> 00:08:12.606
Now, quite apart from the debate

00:08:12.630 --> 00:08:14.926
on whether or not
we should be paying people

00:08:14.950 --> 00:08:17.646
to do what we think they should do anyway,

00:08:17.670 --> 00:08:20.846
the fact of the matter
is that pay for performance

00:08:20.870 --> 00:08:23.286
has actually yielded some positive results

00:08:23.310 --> 00:08:25.006
in places like Mexico,

00:08:25.030 --> 00:08:26.286
in Brazil

00:08:26.310 --> 00:08:28.910
and also in pilot programs in New York.

00:08:29.670 --> 00:08:31.166
But there are also benefits

00:08:31.190 --> 00:08:35.550
and significant changes underway
on left-leaning policies.

00:08:36.030 --> 00:08:40.286
Arguments that government should
expand its role and responsibility

00:08:40.310 --> 00:08:42.526
so that it's not so narrowly defined

00:08:42.550 --> 00:08:45.045
and that government should be
much more of an arbiter

00:08:45.069 --> 00:08:46.446
of the factors of production

00:08:46.470 --> 00:08:48.870
have become commonplace
with the success of China.

00:08:49.550 --> 00:08:51.846
But also we've started to have debates

00:08:51.870 --> 00:08:54.126
about how the role of the private sector

00:08:54.150 --> 00:08:56.726
should move away
from just being a profit motive

00:08:56.750 --> 00:09:00.246
and really be more engaged
in the delivery of social programs.

00:09:00.270 --> 00:09:03.486
Things like the corporate
social responsibility programs,

00:09:03.510 --> 00:09:05.486
albeit small in scale,

00:09:05.510 --> 00:09:07.390
are moving in that right direction.

00:09:08.110 --> 00:09:13.326
Of course, left-leaning policies
have also tended to blur the lines

00:09:13.350 --> 00:09:16.030
between government,
NGOs and private sector.

00:09:16.950 --> 00:09:20.926
Two very good examples of this
are the 19th-century United States,

00:09:20.950 --> 00:09:22.566
when the infrastructure rollout

00:09:22.590 --> 00:09:25.686
was really about
public-private partnerships.

00:09:25.710 --> 00:09:27.126
More recently, of course,

00:09:27.150 --> 00:09:30.766
the advent of the Internet
has also proven to the world

00:09:30.790 --> 00:09:34.630
that public and private can work together
for the betterment of society.

00:09:36.390 --> 00:09:39.446
My fundamental message to you is this:

00:09:39.470 --> 00:09:44.886
We cannot continue to try and solve
the world economic growth challenges

00:09:44.910 --> 00:09:49.070
by being dogmatic
and being unnecessarily ideological.

00:09:49.950 --> 00:09:53.766
In order to create sustainable,
long-term economic growth

00:09:53.790 --> 00:09:58.086
and solve the challenges and social ills
that continue to plague the world today,

00:09:58.110 --> 00:10:00.406
we're going to have to be
more broad-minded

00:10:00.430 --> 00:10:01.950
about what might work.

00:10:02.430 --> 00:10:04.006
Ultimately,

00:10:04.030 --> 00:10:08.166
we have to recognize
that ideology is the enemy of growth.

00:10:08.190 --> 00:10:09.406
Thank you.

00:10:09.430 --> 00:10:11.670
(Applause)

00:10:15.310 --> 00:10:18.206
Bruno Giussani: I want to ask
a couple of questions, Dambisa,

00:10:18.230 --> 00:10:20.366
because one could react
to your last sentence

00:10:20.390 --> 00:10:22.206
by saying growth is also an ideology,

00:10:22.230 --> 00:10:24.566
it's possibly the dominant
ideology of our times.

00:10:24.590 --> 00:10:26.686
What do you say
to those who react that way?

00:10:26.710 --> 00:10:29.166
DM: Well, I think that that's
completely legitimate,

00:10:29.190 --> 00:10:31.766
and I think that we're already
having that discussion.

00:10:31.790 --> 00:10:34.006
There's a lot of work
going on around happiness

00:10:34.030 --> 00:10:37.526
and other metrics being used
for measuring people's success

00:10:37.550 --> 00:10:39.366
and improvements in living standards.

00:10:39.390 --> 00:10:41.446
And so I think that we should be open

00:10:41.470 --> 00:10:44.446
to what could deliver improvements
in people's living standards

00:10:44.470 --> 00:10:46.726
and continue to reduce
poverty around the world.

00:10:46.750 --> 00:10:49.566
BG: So you're basically pleading
for rehabilitating growth,

00:10:49.590 --> 00:10:51.166
but the only way for that happen

00:10:51.190 --> 00:10:53.526
without compromising
the capacity of the earth,

00:10:53.550 --> 00:10:55.086
to take us on a long journey,

00:10:55.110 --> 00:10:56.766
is for economic growth

00:10:56.790 --> 00:10:59.486
somehow to decouple
from the underlying use of resources.

00:10:59.510 --> 00:11:00.806
Do you see that happening?

00:11:00.830 --> 00:11:05.366
DM: Well, I think that I'm more optimistic
about human ability and ingenuity.

00:11:05.390 --> 00:11:07.566
I think if we start to constrain ourselves

00:11:07.590 --> 00:11:10.646
using the finite, scarce
and depleting resources

00:11:10.670 --> 00:11:11.926
that we know today,

00:11:11.950 --> 00:11:13.286
we could get quite negative

00:11:13.310 --> 00:11:15.526
and quite concerned
about the way the world is.

00:11:15.550 --> 00:11:17.846
However, we've seen the Club of Rome,

00:11:17.870 --> 00:11:20.286
we've seen previous claims

00:11:20.310 --> 00:11:22.646
that the world would be
running out of resources,

00:11:22.670 --> 00:11:25.246
and it's not to argue
that those things are not valid.

00:11:25.270 --> 00:11:27.926
But I think, with ingenuity
we could see desalination,

00:11:27.950 --> 00:11:29.886
I think we could reinvest in energy,

00:11:29.910 --> 00:11:32.046
so that we can actually
get better outcomes.

00:11:32.070 --> 00:11:33.286
And so in that sense,

00:11:33.310 --> 00:11:35.686
I'm much more optimistic
about what humans can do.

00:11:35.710 --> 00:11:37.126
BG: The thing that strikes me

00:11:37.150 --> 00:11:40.526
about your proposals
for rehabilitating growth

00:11:40.550 --> 00:11:42.166
and taking a different direction

00:11:42.190 --> 00:11:47.246
is that you're kind of suggesting
to fix capitalism with more capitalism --

00:11:47.270 --> 00:11:50.886
with putting a price tag
on good behavior as incentive

00:11:50.910 --> 00:11:55.086
or developing a bigger role
for business in social issues.

00:11:55.110 --> 00:11:56.606
Is that what you're suggesting?

00:11:56.630 --> 00:11:58.766
DM: I'm suggesting
we have to be open-minded.

00:11:58.790 --> 00:12:01.006
I think it is absolutely the case

00:12:01.030 --> 00:12:03.486
that traditional models of economic growth

00:12:03.510 --> 00:12:05.926
are not working the way
we would like them to.

00:12:05.950 --> 00:12:07.846
And I think it's no accident

00:12:07.870 --> 00:12:11.166
that today the largest
economy in the world, the United States,

00:12:11.190 --> 00:12:12.486
has democracy,

00:12:12.510 --> 00:12:15.606
liberal democracy,
as it's core political stance

00:12:15.630 --> 00:12:17.806
and it has free market capitalism --

00:12:17.830 --> 00:12:19.406
to the extent that it is free --

00:12:19.430 --> 00:12:21.606
free market capitalism
as its economic stance.

00:12:21.630 --> 00:12:23.766
The second largest economy is China.

00:12:23.790 --> 00:12:25.926
It has deprioritized democracy

00:12:25.950 --> 00:12:29.126
and it has state capitalism,
which is a completely different model.

00:12:29.150 --> 00:12:31.886
These two countries,
completely different political models

00:12:31.910 --> 00:12:33.886
and completely different economic models,

00:12:33.910 --> 00:12:36.326
and yet they have the same
income inequality number

00:12:36.350 --> 00:12:37.846
measured as a Gini coefficient.

00:12:37.870 --> 00:12:40.006
I think those are the debates
we should have,

00:12:40.030 --> 00:12:42.166
because it's not clear at all

00:12:42.190 --> 00:12:44.006
what model we should be adopting,

00:12:44.030 --> 00:12:46.366
and I think there needs to be
much more discourse

00:12:46.390 --> 00:12:49.806
and much more humility
about what we know and what we don't know.

00:12:49.830 --> 00:12:53.206
BG: One last question.
The COP21 is going on in Paris.

00:12:53.230 --> 00:12:54.726
If you could send a tweet

00:12:54.750 --> 00:12:58.046
to all the heads of state
and heads of delegations there,

00:12:58.070 --> 00:12:59.446
what would you say?

00:12:59.470 --> 00:13:02.126
DM: Again, I would be very much
about being open-minded.

00:13:02.150 --> 00:13:03.366
As you're aware,

00:13:03.390 --> 00:13:05.486
the issues around
the environmental concerns

00:13:05.510 --> 00:13:07.486
have been on the agenda many times now --

00:13:07.510 --> 00:13:09.766
in Copenhagen,
'72 in Stockholm --

00:13:09.790 --> 00:13:12.086
and we keep revisiting these issues

00:13:12.110 --> 00:13:15.686
partly because there is not
a fundamental agreement,

00:13:15.710 --> 00:13:16.966
in fact there's a schism

00:13:16.990 --> 00:13:19.726
between what the developed
countries believe and want

00:13:19.750 --> 00:13:22.086
and what emerging market countries want.

00:13:22.110 --> 00:13:25.326
Emerging market countries need
to continue to create economic growth

00:13:25.350 --> 00:13:28.766
so that we don't have political
uncertainty in the those countries.

00:13:28.790 --> 00:13:30.926
Developed countries recognize

00:13:30.950 --> 00:13:33.206
that they have a real,
important responsibility

00:13:33.230 --> 00:13:36.046
not only just to manage
their CO2 emissions

00:13:36.070 --> 00:13:39.246
and some of the degradation
that they're contributing to the world,

00:13:39.270 --> 00:13:41.046
but also as trendsetters in R&amp;D.

00:13:41.070 --> 00:13:43.326
And so they have to come
to the table as well.

00:13:43.350 --> 00:13:45.806
But in essence, it cannot be a situation

00:13:45.830 --> 00:13:49.966
where we start ascribing policies
to the emerging markets

00:13:49.990 --> 00:13:51.846
without developed countries themselves

00:13:51.870 --> 00:13:54.246
also taking quite a swipe
at what they're doing

00:13:54.270 --> 00:13:57.046
both in demand and supply
in developed markets.

00:13:57.070 --> 00:14:00.166
BG: Dambisa, thank you for coming to TED.
DM: Thank you very much.

00:14:00.190 --> 00:14:03.633
