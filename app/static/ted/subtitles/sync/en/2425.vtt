00:00:13.165 --> 00:00:15.927
You may never have heard
of Kenema, Sierra Leone

00:00:15.951 --> 00:00:17.483
or Arua, Nigeria.

00:00:17.507 --> 00:00:21.278
But I know them as two of the most
extraordinary places on earth.

00:00:22.106 --> 00:00:27.159
In hospitals there, there's a community
of nurses, physicians and scientists

00:00:27.183 --> 00:00:28.740
that have been quietly battling

00:00:28.764 --> 00:00:31.464
one of the deadliest threats
to humanity for years:

00:00:31.488 --> 00:00:32.662
Lassa virus.

00:00:33.268 --> 00:00:35.406
Lassa virus is a lot like Ebola.

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.663
It can cause a severe fever
and can often be fatal.

00:00:39.203 --> 00:00:43.142
But these individuals,
they risk their lives every day

00:00:43.166 --> 00:00:46.083
to protect the individuals
in their communities,

00:00:46.107 --> 00:00:48.687
and by doing so, protect us all.

00:00:49.243 --> 00:00:52.151
But one of the most extraordinary things
I learned about them

00:00:52.175 --> 00:00:54.742
on one of my first visits
out there many years ago

00:00:54.766 --> 00:00:56.475
was that they start each morning --

00:00:56.499 --> 00:01:01.442
these challenging, extraordinary days
on the front lines -- by singing.

00:01:01.881 --> 00:01:05.220
They gather together,
and they show their joy.

00:01:05.244 --> 00:01:06.766
They show their spirit.

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:07.949
And over the years,

00:01:07.973 --> 00:01:11.086
from year after year as I've visited them
and they've visited me,

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:13.103
I get to gather with them and I sing

00:01:13.127 --> 00:01:15.301
and we write and we love it,

00:01:15.325 --> 00:01:18.868
because it reminds us that we're not
just there to pursue science together;

00:01:18.892 --> 00:01:21.209
we're bonded through a shared humanity.

00:01:21.736 --> 00:01:26.059
And that of course, as you can imagine,
becomes extremely important,

00:01:26.083 --> 00:01:28.856
even essential, as things begin to change.

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:33.669
And that changed a great deal
in March of 2014,

00:01:33.693 --> 00:01:36.039
when the Ebola outbreak
was declared in Guinea.

00:01:36.576 --> 00:01:38.708
This is the first outbreak in West Africa,

00:01:38.732 --> 00:01:41.174
near the border
of Sierra Leone and Liberia.

00:01:42.224 --> 00:01:44.746
And it was frightening,
frightening for us all.

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:46.682
We had actually suspected for some time

00:01:46.706 --> 00:01:49.348
that Lassa and Ebola were more
widespread than thought,

00:01:49.372 --> 00:01:51.681
and we thought it could
one day come to Kenema.

00:01:52.046 --> 00:01:54.456
And so members of my team
immediately went out

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:56.877
and joined Dr. Humarr Khan
and his team there,

00:01:56.901 --> 00:02:00.578
and we set up diagnostics to be able
to have sensitive molecular tests

00:02:00.602 --> 00:02:02.755
to pick up Ebola if it came
across the border

00:02:02.779 --> 00:02:04.042
and into Sierra Leone.

00:02:04.066 --> 00:02:07.062
We'd already set up this kind
of capacity for Lassa virus,

00:02:07.086 --> 00:02:08.243
we knew how to do it,

00:02:08.267 --> 00:02:09.697
the team is outstanding.

00:02:09.721 --> 00:02:12.958
We just had to give them
the tools and place to survey for Ebola.

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:15.118
And unfortunately, that day came.

00:02:15.142 --> 00:02:20.123
On May 23, 2014, a woman checked
into the maternity ward at the hospital,

00:02:20.147 --> 00:02:23.873
and the team ran
those important molecular tests

00:02:23.897 --> 00:02:27.732
and they identified the first
confirmed case of Ebola in Sierra Leone.

00:02:28.257 --> 00:02:30.306
This was an exceptional
work that was done.

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:32.590
They were able to diagnose
the case immediately,

00:02:32.614 --> 00:02:34.927
to safely treat the patient

00:02:34.951 --> 00:02:37.969
and to begin to do contact tracing
to follow what was going on.

00:02:37.993 --> 00:02:39.965
It could've stopped something.

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:42.836
But by the time that day came,

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:45.218
the outbreak had already
been breeding for months.

00:02:45.242 --> 00:02:48.882
With hundreds of cases, it had already
eclipsed all previous outbreaks.

00:02:48.906 --> 00:02:52.550
And it came into Sierra Leone
not as that singular case,

00:02:52.574 --> 00:02:53.866
but as a tidal wave.

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:56.545
We had to work
with the international community,

00:02:56.569 --> 00:03:00.275
with the Ministry of Health, with Kenema,
to begin to deal with the cases,

00:03:00.299 --> 00:03:02.370
as the next week brought 31,

00:03:02.394 --> 00:03:06.068
then 92, then 147 cases --
all coming to Kenema,

00:03:06.092 --> 00:03:09.393
one of the only places in Sierra Leone
that could deal with this.

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:13.159
And we worked around the clock
trying to do everything we could,

00:03:13.183 --> 00:03:16.144
trying to help the individuals,
trying to get attention,

00:03:16.168 --> 00:03:18.115
but we also did one other simple thing.

00:03:18.694 --> 00:03:22.483
From that specimen that we take
from a patient's blood to detect Ebola,

00:03:22.507 --> 00:03:24.562
we can discard it, obviously.

00:03:24.586 --> 00:03:28.202
The other thing we can do is, actually,
put in a chemical and deactivate it,

00:03:28.226 --> 00:03:30.956
so just place it into a box
and ship it across the ocean,

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:32.131
and that's what we did.

00:03:32.155 --> 00:03:34.251
We sent it to Boston, where my team works.

00:03:34.874 --> 00:03:38.711
And we also worked around the clock
doing shift work, day after day,

00:03:38.735 --> 00:03:42.604
and we quickly generated 99 genomes
of the Ebola virus.

00:03:42.628 --> 00:03:45.685
This is the blueprint -- the genome
of a virus is the blueprint.

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:46.868
We all have one.

00:03:46.892 --> 00:03:48.837
It says everything that makes up us,

00:03:48.861 --> 00:03:50.770
and it tells us so much information.

00:03:50.794 --> 00:03:53.971
The results of this kind of work
are simple and they're powerful.

00:03:54.546 --> 00:03:57.016
We could actually take
these 99 different viruses,

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:58.487
look at them and compare them,

00:03:58.511 --> 00:04:01.357
and we could see, actually,
compared to three genomes

00:04:01.381 --> 00:04:04.217
that had been previously
published from Guinea,

00:04:04.241 --> 00:04:07.952
we could show that the outbreak
emerged in Guinea months before,

00:04:07.976 --> 00:04:09.818
once into the human population,

00:04:09.842 --> 00:04:12.514
and from there had been transmitting
from human to human.

00:04:12.538 --> 00:04:14.082
Now, that's incredibly important

00:04:14.106 --> 00:04:16.474
when you're trying to figure out
how to intervene,

00:04:16.498 --> 00:04:18.564
but the important thing
is contact tracing.

00:04:18.588 --> 00:04:21.990
We also could see that as the virus
was moving between humans,

00:04:22.014 --> 00:04:23.271
it was mutating.

00:04:23.295 --> 00:04:25.446
And each of those mutations
are so important,

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:27.790
because the diagnostics, the vaccines,

00:04:27.814 --> 00:04:29.299
the therapies that we're using,

00:04:29.323 --> 00:04:32.681
are all based on that genome
sequence, fundamentally --

00:04:32.705 --> 00:04:33.926
that's what drives it.

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:36.832
And so global health experts
would need to respond,

00:04:36.856 --> 00:04:38.053
would have to develop,

00:04:38.077 --> 00:04:40.630
to recalibrate everything
that they were doing.

00:04:41.229 --> 00:04:44.410
But the way that science works,
the position I was in at that point

00:04:44.434 --> 00:04:45.585
is, I had the data,

00:04:45.609 --> 00:04:48.245
and I could have worked
in a silo for many, many months,

00:04:48.269 --> 00:04:50.468
analyzed the data carefully, slowly,

00:04:50.492 --> 00:04:53.952
submitted the paper for publication,
gone through a few back-and-forths,

00:04:53.976 --> 00:04:57.105
and then finally when the paper came out,
might release that data.

00:04:57.129 --> 00:04:59.333
That's the way the status quo works.

00:04:59.357 --> 00:05:01.928
Well, that was not going to work
at this point, right?

00:05:01.952 --> 00:05:03.560
We had friends on the front lines

00:05:03.584 --> 00:05:06.838
and to us it was just obvious
that what we needed is help,

00:05:06.862 --> 00:05:08.018
lots of help.

00:05:08.042 --> 00:05:09.439
So the first thing we did is,

00:05:09.463 --> 00:05:12.148
as soon as the sequences
came off the machines,

00:05:12.172 --> 00:05:13.601
we published it to the web.

00:05:13.625 --> 00:05:16.461
We just released it to the whole world
and said, "Help us."

00:05:16.485 --> 00:05:17.820
And help came.

00:05:17.844 --> 00:05:19.006
Before we knew it,

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:21.366
we were being contacted
from people all over,

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:23.834
surprised to see the data
out there and released.

00:05:23.858 --> 00:05:26.110
Some of the greatest
viral trackers in the world

00:05:26.134 --> 00:05:28.213
were suddenly part of our community.

00:05:28.237 --> 00:05:30.567
We were working together
in this virtual way,

00:05:30.591 --> 00:05:33.572
sharing, regular calls, communications,

00:05:33.596 --> 00:05:36.347
trying to follow the virus
minute by minute,

00:05:36.371 --> 00:05:38.592
to see ways that we could stop it.

00:05:39.177 --> 00:05:42.935
And there are so many ways
that we can form communities like that.

00:05:43.332 --> 00:05:47.657
Everybody, particularly when the outbreak
started to expand globally,

00:05:47.681 --> 00:05:51.271
was reaching out to learn,
to participate, to engage.

00:05:51.938 --> 00:05:53.532
Everybody wants to play a part.

00:05:53.556 --> 00:05:56.336
The amount of human capacity
out there is just amazing,

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:58.083
and the Internet connects us all.

00:05:58.107 --> 00:06:01.358
And could you imagine that instead
of being frightened of each other,

00:06:01.382 --> 00:06:03.239
that we all just said, "Let's do this.

00:06:03.263 --> 00:06:05.786
Let's work together,
and let's make this happen."

00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:08.552
But the problem is that the data
that all of us are using,

00:06:08.576 --> 00:06:12.613
Googling on the web, is just too limited
to do what we need to do.

00:06:12.637 --> 00:06:15.288
And so many opportunities
get missed when that happens.

00:06:15.312 --> 00:06:17.793
So in the early part
of the epidemic from Kenema,

00:06:17.817 --> 00:06:20.559
we'd had 106 clinical records
from patients,

00:06:20.583 --> 00:06:23.417
and we once again made that
publicly available to the world.

00:06:23.441 --> 00:06:27.111
And in our own lab, we could show
that you could take those 106 records,

00:06:27.135 --> 00:06:30.753
we could train computers to predict
the prognosis for Ebola patients

00:06:30.777 --> 00:06:32.554
to near 100 percent accuracy.

00:06:32.578 --> 00:06:34.675
And we made an app
that could release that,

00:06:34.699 --> 00:06:37.469
to make that available
to health-care workers in the field.

00:06:37.493 --> 00:06:40.752
But 106 is just not enough
to make it powerful,

00:06:40.776 --> 00:06:41.927
to validate it.

00:06:41.951 --> 00:06:44.605
So we were waiting for more data
to release that.

00:06:44.629 --> 00:06:46.673
and the data has still not come.

00:06:46.697 --> 00:06:49.229
We are still waiting, tweaking away,

00:06:49.253 --> 00:06:52.091
in silos rather than working together.

00:06:52.115 --> 00:06:54.347
And this just -- we can't accept that.

00:06:54.371 --> 00:06:58.175
Right? You, all of you,
cannot accept that.

00:06:58.199 --> 00:06:59.881
It's our lives on the line.

00:06:59.905 --> 00:07:01.616
And in fact, actually,

00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:04.183
many lives were lost,
many health-care workers,

00:07:04.207 --> 00:07:06.101
including beloved colleagues of mine,

00:07:06.125 --> 00:07:09.872
five colleagues:
Mbalu Fonnie, Alex Moigboi,

00:07:09.896 --> 00:07:13.907
Dr. Humarr Khan, Alice Kovoma
and Mohamed Fullah.

00:07:13.931 --> 00:07:16.457
These are just five
of many health-care workers

00:07:16.481 --> 00:07:18.245
at Kenema and beyond

00:07:18.269 --> 00:07:21.305
that died while the world waited
and while we all worked,

00:07:21.329 --> 00:07:23.189
quietly and separately.

00:07:23.213 --> 00:07:25.246
See, Ebola, like all threats to humanity,

00:07:25.270 --> 00:07:29.154
it's fueled by mistrust
and distraction and division.

00:07:29.178 --> 00:07:32.951
When we build barriers amongst ourselves
and we fight amongst ourselves,

00:07:32.975 --> 00:07:34.795
the virus thrives.

00:07:34.819 --> 00:07:36.611
But unlike all threats to humanity,

00:07:36.635 --> 00:07:39.281
Ebola is one where
we're actually all the same.

00:07:39.305 --> 00:07:41.185
We're all in this fight together.

00:07:41.209 --> 00:07:43.843
Ebola on one person's doorstep
could soon be on ours.

00:07:44.327 --> 00:07:47.129
And so in this place
with the same vulnerabilities,

00:07:47.153 --> 00:07:49.566
the same strengths,
the same fears, the same hopes,

00:07:49.590 --> 00:07:52.799
I hope that we work together with joy.

00:07:54.577 --> 00:07:57.647
A graduate student of mine
was reading a book about Sierra Leone,

00:07:57.671 --> 00:08:00.005
and she discovered that the word "Kenema,"

00:08:00.029 --> 00:08:03.472
the hospital that we work at and the city
where we work in Sierra Leone,

00:08:03.496 --> 00:08:07.677
is named after the Mende word
for "clear like a river, translucent

00:08:07.701 --> 00:08:09.288
and open to the public gaze."

00:08:09.589 --> 00:08:11.134
That was really profound for us,

00:08:11.158 --> 00:08:13.252
because without knowing it,
we'd always felt

00:08:13.276 --> 00:08:16.460
that in order to honor the individuals
in Kenema where we worked,

00:08:16.484 --> 00:08:20.771
we had to work openly, we had to share
and we had to work together.

00:08:21.224 --> 00:08:22.401
And we have to do that.

00:08:22.425 --> 00:08:26.186
We all have to demand that
of ourselves and others --

00:08:26.210 --> 00:08:29.084
to be open to each other
when an outbreak happens,

00:08:29.108 --> 00:08:30.758
to fight in this fight together.

00:08:30.782 --> 00:08:33.691
Because this is not the first
outbreak of Ebola,

00:08:33.715 --> 00:08:35.163
it will not be the last,

00:08:35.187 --> 00:08:38.342
and there are many other microbes
out there that are lying in wait,

00:08:38.366 --> 00:08:39.791
like Lassa virus and others.

00:08:39.815 --> 00:08:41.324
And the next time this happens,

00:08:41.348 --> 00:08:44.544
it could happen in a city of millions,
it could start there.

00:08:44.568 --> 00:08:47.267
It could be something
that's transmitted through the air.

00:08:47.291 --> 00:08:49.438
It could even be
disseminated intentionally.

00:08:49.462 --> 00:08:52.443
And I know that that is frightening,
I understand that,

00:08:52.467 --> 00:08:55.121
but I know also,
and this experience shows us,

00:08:55.145 --> 00:08:58.465
that we have the technology
and we have the capacity

00:08:58.489 --> 00:09:00.084
to win this thing,

00:09:00.108 --> 00:09:02.954
to win this and have
the upper hand over viruses.

00:09:02.978 --> 00:09:05.250
But we can only do it if we do it together

00:09:05.274 --> 00:09:06.471
and we do it with joy.

00:09:07.021 --> 00:09:08.542
So for Dr. Khan

00:09:08.566 --> 00:09:12.732
and for all of those who sacrificed
their lives on the front lines

00:09:12.756 --> 00:09:15.156
in this fight with us always,

00:09:15.180 --> 00:09:17.987
let us be in this fight with them always.

00:09:18.011 --> 00:09:19.886
And let us not let the world be defined

00:09:19.910 --> 00:09:22.029
by the destruction wrought by one virus,

00:09:22.053 --> 00:09:24.834
but illuminated by billions
of hearts and minds

00:09:24.858 --> 00:09:26.066
working in unity.

00:09:26.090 --> 00:09:27.264
Thank you.

00:09:27.288 --> 00:09:34.157
(Applause)
