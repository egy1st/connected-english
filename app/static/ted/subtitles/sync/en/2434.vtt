00:00:12.994 --> 00:00:15.587
As a kid, I used to dream about the ocean.

00:00:15.611 --> 00:00:19.070
It was this wild place
full of color and life,

00:00:19.962 --> 00:00:23.182
home to these alien-looking,
fantastical creatures.

00:00:23.206 --> 00:00:25.624
I pictured big sharks
ruling the food chain

00:00:25.648 --> 00:00:28.852
and saw graceful sea turtles
dancing across coral reefs.

00:00:28.876 --> 00:00:30.891
As a marine biologist turned photographer,

00:00:30.915 --> 00:00:33.735
I've spent most of my career
looking for places

00:00:33.759 --> 00:00:36.989
as magical as those I used
to dream about when I was little.

00:00:37.629 --> 00:00:38.780
As you can see,

00:00:38.804 --> 00:00:41.430
I began exploring bodies of water
at a fairly young age.

00:00:41.454 --> 00:00:43.470
But the first time
I truly went underwater,

00:00:43.494 --> 00:00:44.895
I was about 10 years old.

00:00:44.919 --> 00:00:47.566
And I can still vividly remember
furiously finning

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:51.065
to reach this old, encrusted
cannon on a shallow coral reef.

00:00:51.089 --> 00:00:53.257
And when I finally managed
to grab hold of it,

00:00:53.281 --> 00:00:56.366
I looked up, and I was instantly
surrounded by fish

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:58.339
in all colors of the rainbow.

00:00:58.363 --> 00:01:00.966
That was the day
I fell in love with the ocean.

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:02.355
Thomas Peschak

00:01:02.379 --> 00:01:04.062
Conservation Photographer

00:01:05.141 --> 00:01:06.791
In my 40 years on this planet,

00:01:06.815 --> 00:01:08.673
I've had the great privilege to explore

00:01:08.697 --> 00:01:10.785
some of its most incredible seascapes

00:01:10.809 --> 00:01:12.797
for National Geographic Magazine

00:01:12.821 --> 00:01:14.448
and the Save Our Seas Foundation.

00:01:14.472 --> 00:01:17.588
I've photographed everything
from really, really big sharks

00:01:17.612 --> 00:01:20.805
to dainty ones that fit
in the palm of your hand.

00:01:20.829 --> 00:01:23.781
I've smelled the fishy, fishy breath
of humpback whales

00:01:23.805 --> 00:01:25.416
feeding just feet away from me

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:28.264
in the cold seas off Canada's
Great Bear Rainforest.

00:01:28.288 --> 00:01:31.225
And I've been privy to the mating rituals
of green sea turtles

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:32.587
in the Mozambique Channel.

00:01:32.611 --> 00:01:36.335
Everyone on this planet affects
and is affected by the ocean.

00:01:36.359 --> 00:01:39.112
And the pristine seas
I used to dream of as a child

00:01:39.136 --> 00:01:41.828
are becoming harder and harder to find.

00:01:41.852 --> 00:01:43.947
They are becoming more compressed

00:01:43.971 --> 00:01:45.817
and more threatened.

00:01:45.841 --> 00:01:48.395
As we humans continue to maintain our role

00:01:48.419 --> 00:01:50.760
as the leading predator on earth,

00:01:50.784 --> 00:01:55.203
I've witnessed and photographed
many of these ripple effects firsthand.

00:01:55.227 --> 00:01:58.399
For a long time, I thought
I had to shock my audience

00:01:58.423 --> 00:02:00.732
out of their indifference
with disturbing images.

00:02:00.756 --> 00:02:02.656
And while this approach has merits,

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:04.026
I have come full circle.

00:02:04.518 --> 00:02:07.137
I believe that the best way
for me to effect change

00:02:07.161 --> 00:02:08.758
is to sell love.

00:02:08.782 --> 00:02:10.829
I guess I'm a matchmaker of sorts

00:02:10.853 --> 00:02:12.338
and as a photographer,

00:02:12.362 --> 00:02:14.172
I have the rare opportunity

00:02:14.196 --> 00:02:16.518
to reveal animals and entire ecosystems

00:02:16.542 --> 00:02:19.583
that lie hidden beneath
the ocean's surface.

00:02:19.607 --> 00:02:22.392
You can't love something
and become a champion for it

00:02:22.416 --> 00:02:24.551
if you don't know it exists.

00:02:24.575 --> 00:02:28.797
Uncovering this -- that is the power
of conservation photography.

00:02:29.304 --> 00:02:31.304
(Music)

00:02:32.711 --> 00:02:35.511
I've visited hundreds of marine locations,

00:02:35.535 --> 00:02:37.461
but there are a handful of seascapes

00:02:37.485 --> 00:02:39.499
that have touched me incredibly deeply.

00:02:41.078 --> 00:02:43.796
The first time I experienced
that kind of high

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:45.213
was about 10 years ago,

00:02:45.237 --> 00:02:48.072
off South Africa's rugged, wild coast.

00:02:48.096 --> 00:02:49.442
And every June and July,

00:02:49.466 --> 00:02:51.875
enormous shoals of sardines
travel northwards

00:02:51.899 --> 00:02:54.224
in a mass migration
we call the Sardine Run.

00:02:54.248 --> 00:02:56.857
And boy, do those fish
have good reason to run.

00:02:56.881 --> 00:03:01.170
In hot pursuit are hoards
of hungry and agile predators.

00:03:01.194 --> 00:03:03.052
Common dolphins hunt together

00:03:03.076 --> 00:03:05.997
and they can separate some
of the sardines from the main shoal

00:03:06.021 --> 00:03:07.425
and they create bait balls.

00:03:07.449 --> 00:03:11.137
They drive and trap the fish upward
against the ocean surface

00:03:11.161 --> 00:03:12.729
and then they rush in to dine

00:03:12.753 --> 00:03:15.564
on this pulsating and movable feast.

00:03:15.588 --> 00:03:17.384
Close behind are sharks.

00:03:17.408 --> 00:03:18.563
Now, most people believe

00:03:18.587 --> 00:03:20.964
that sharks and dolphins
are these mortal enemies,

00:03:20.988 --> 00:03:23.760
but during the Sardine Run,
they actually coexist.

00:03:23.784 --> 00:03:27.955
In fact, dolphins actually
help sharks feed more effectively.

00:03:27.979 --> 00:03:31.561
Without dolphins, the bait balls
are more dispersed

00:03:31.585 --> 00:03:35.323
and sharks often end up
with what I call a sardine donut,

00:03:35.347 --> 00:03:36.807
or a mouth full of water.

00:03:36.831 --> 00:03:40.872
Now, while I've had a few spicy moments
with sharks on the sardine run,

00:03:40.896 --> 00:03:42.962
I know they don't see me as prey.

00:03:42.986 --> 00:03:46.189
However, I get bumped and tail-slapped
just like any other guest

00:03:46.213 --> 00:03:47.982
at this rowdy, rowdy banquet.

00:03:49.935 --> 00:03:52.864
From the shores of Africa we travel east,

00:03:52.888 --> 00:03:54.989
across the vastness
that is the Indian Ocean

00:03:55.013 --> 00:03:58.905
to the Maldives, an archipelago
of coral islands.

00:03:58.929 --> 00:04:01.467
And during the stormy southwest monsoon,

00:04:01.491 --> 00:04:03.801
manta rays from all across the archipelago

00:04:03.825 --> 00:04:07.078
travel to a tiny speck
in Baa Atoll called Hanifaru.

00:04:07.102 --> 00:04:08.285
Armies of crustaceans,

00:04:08.309 --> 00:04:10.523
most no bigger than the size
of your pupils,

00:04:10.547 --> 00:04:13.732
are the mainstay of the manta ray's diet.

00:04:14.335 --> 00:04:17.118
When plankton concentrations
become patchy,

00:04:17.142 --> 00:04:18.328
manta rays feed alone

00:04:18.352 --> 00:04:21.064
and they somersault themselves
backwards again and again,

00:04:21.088 --> 00:04:23.439
very much like a puppy
chasing its own tail.

00:04:23.907 --> 00:04:25.907
(Music)

00:04:27.161 --> 00:04:29.654
However, when plankton densities increase,

00:04:29.678 --> 00:04:33.877
the mantas line up head-to-tail
to form these long feeding chains,

00:04:33.901 --> 00:04:37.225
and any tasty morsel that escapes
the first or second manta in line

00:04:37.249 --> 00:04:40.705
is surely to be gobbled up
by the next or the one after.

00:04:42.062 --> 00:04:43.958
As plankton levels peak in the bay,

00:04:43.982 --> 00:04:46.187
the mantas swim closer and closer together

00:04:46.211 --> 00:04:48.572
in a unique behavior
we call cyclone feeding.

00:04:49.002 --> 00:04:51.272
And as they swirl in tight formation,

00:04:51.296 --> 00:04:52.967
this multi-step column of mantas

00:04:52.991 --> 00:04:56.868
creates its own vortex, sucking in
and delivering the plankton

00:04:56.892 --> 00:04:59.700
right into the mantas' cavernous mouths.

00:04:59.724 --> 00:05:04.066
The experience of diving
amongst such masses of hundreds of rays

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:06.118
is truly unforgettable.

00:05:07.031 --> 00:05:09.031
(Music)

00:05:54.398 --> 00:05:56.079
When I first photographed Hanifaru,

00:05:56.103 --> 00:05:57.665
the site enjoyed no protection

00:05:57.689 --> 00:05:59.312
and was threatened by development.

00:05:59.336 --> 00:06:01.439
And working with NGOs
like the Manta Trust,

00:06:01.463 --> 00:06:03.344
my images eventually helped Hanifaru

00:06:03.368 --> 00:06:05.795
become a marine-protected area.

00:06:05.819 --> 00:06:07.895
Now, fisherman from neighboring islands,

00:06:07.919 --> 00:06:09.589
they once hunted these manta rays

00:06:09.613 --> 00:06:12.237
to make traditional drums
from their skins.

00:06:12.261 --> 00:06:15.936
Today, they are the most ardent
conservation champions

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:18.237
and manta rays earn the Maldivian economy

00:06:18.261 --> 00:06:21.974
in excess of 8 million dollars
every single year.

00:06:23.332 --> 00:06:25.681
I have always wanted
to travel back in time

00:06:25.705 --> 00:06:28.295
to an era where maps were mostly blank

00:06:28.319 --> 00:06:30.248
or they read, "There be dragons."

00:06:30.272 --> 00:06:33.856
And today, the closest I've come
is visiting remote atolls

00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:35.572
in the western Indian Ocean.

00:06:35.596 --> 00:06:38.817
Far, far away from shipping lanes
and fishing fleets,

00:06:38.841 --> 00:06:42.175
diving into these waters
is a poignant reminder

00:06:42.199 --> 00:06:44.627
of what our oceans once looked like.

00:06:44.651 --> 00:06:47.280
Very few people have heard
of Bassas da India,

00:06:47.304 --> 00:06:50.725
a tiny speck of coral
in the Mozambique Channel.

00:06:51.352 --> 00:06:54.495
Its reef forms a protective outer barrier

00:06:54.519 --> 00:06:57.195
and the inner lagoon is a nursery ground

00:06:57.219 --> 00:06:58.734
for Galapagos sharks.

00:06:58.758 --> 00:07:03.365
These sharks are anything but shy,
even during the day.

00:07:03.389 --> 00:07:06.008
I had a bit of a hunch
that they'd be even bolder

00:07:06.032 --> 00:07:07.643
and more abundant at night.

00:07:08.222 --> 00:07:10.222
(Music)

00:07:16.329 --> 00:07:18.202
Never before have I encountered

00:07:18.226 --> 00:07:21.499
so many sharks on a single coral outcrop.

00:07:21.523 --> 00:07:24.528
Capturing and sharing moments like this --

00:07:25.630 --> 00:07:28.234
that reminds me why I chose my path.

00:07:29.638 --> 00:07:33.396
Earlier this year, I was on assignment
for National Geographic Magazine

00:07:33.420 --> 00:07:35.038
in Baja California.

00:07:35.062 --> 00:07:37.799
And about halfway down the peninsula
on the Pacific side

00:07:37.823 --> 00:07:39.262
lies San Ignacio Lagoon,

00:07:39.286 --> 00:07:41.800
a critical calving ground for gray whales.

00:07:41.824 --> 00:07:46.090
For 100 years, this coast was the scene
of a wholesale slaughter,

00:07:46.114 --> 00:07:48.526
where more than 20,000
gray whales were killed,

00:07:48.550 --> 00:07:50.824
leaving only a few hundred survivors.

00:07:50.848 --> 00:07:53.518
Today the descendents of these same whales

00:07:53.542 --> 00:07:55.405
nudge their youngsters to the surface

00:07:55.429 --> 00:07:58.484
to play and even interact with us.

00:07:59.397 --> 00:08:01.397
(Music)

00:08:08.727 --> 00:08:13.147
This species truly has made
a remarkable comeback.

00:08:14.718 --> 00:08:17.689
Now, on the other side
of the peninsula lies Cabo Pulmo,

00:08:17.713 --> 00:08:19.386
a sleepy fishing village.

00:08:19.410 --> 00:08:22.844
Decades of overfishing
had brought them close to collapse.

00:08:22.868 --> 00:08:25.328
In 1995, local fisherman
convinced the authorities

00:08:25.352 --> 00:08:27.604
to proclaim their waters a marine reserve.

00:08:27.628 --> 00:08:31.181
But what happened next
was nothing short of miraculous.

00:08:31.205 --> 00:08:35.475
In 2005, after only
a single decade of protection,

00:08:35.499 --> 00:08:39.992
scientists measured the largest
recovery of fish ever recorded.

00:08:40.016 --> 00:08:42.427
But don't take my word
for it -- come with me.

00:08:42.451 --> 00:08:45.189
On a single breath, swim with me in deep,

00:08:45.213 --> 00:08:48.245
into one of the largest
and densest schools of fish

00:08:48.269 --> 00:08:50.842
I have ever encountered.

00:08:51.635 --> 00:08:53.635
(Music)

00:09:03.285 --> 00:09:06.119
We all have the ability
to be creators of hope.

00:09:06.143 --> 00:09:08.071
And through my photography,

00:09:08.095 --> 00:09:11.558
I want to pass on the message
that it is not too late for our oceans.

00:09:11.582 --> 00:09:15.017
And particularly, I want to focus
on nature's resilience

00:09:15.041 --> 00:09:19.027
in the face of 7.3 billion people.

00:09:19.051 --> 00:09:20.868
My hope is that in the future,

00:09:20.892 --> 00:09:22.842
I will have to search much, much harder

00:09:22.866 --> 00:09:25.051
to make photographs like this,

00:09:25.075 --> 00:09:27.160
while creating images that showcase

00:09:27.184 --> 00:09:30.203
our respectful coexistence with the ocean.

00:09:30.227 --> 00:09:33.628
Those will hopefully become
an everyday occurrence for me.

00:09:34.986 --> 00:09:37.261
To thrive and survive in my profession,

00:09:37.285 --> 00:09:40.278
you really have to be a hopeless optimist.

00:09:40.302 --> 00:09:42.323
And I always operate on the assumption

00:09:42.347 --> 00:09:45.452
that the next great picture
that will effect change

00:09:45.476 --> 00:09:47.279
is right around the corner,

00:09:47.303 --> 00:09:49.636
behind the next coral head,

00:09:49.660 --> 00:09:51.262
inside the next lagoon

00:09:51.286 --> 00:09:53.935
or possibly, in the one after it.

00:09:54.823 --> 00:09:56.823
(Music)
