00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:16.766
So a while ago, I tried an experiment.

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:20.230
For one year, I would say yes
to all the things that scared me.

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:24.206
Anything that made me nervous,
took me out of my comfort zone,

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:25.990
I forced myself to say yes to.

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:28.165
Did I want to speak in public?

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:29.870
No, but yes.

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:32.326
Did I want to be on live TV?

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:34.150
No, but yes.

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:36.446
Did I want to try acting?

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:39.526
No, no, no, but yes, yes, yes.

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:41.606
And a crazy thing happened:

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:44.366
the very act of doing
the thing that scared me

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:46.046
undid the fear,

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:47.606
made it not scary.

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:52.070
My fear of public speaking,
my social anxiety, poof, gone.

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:55.726
It's amazing, the power of one word.

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:57.886
"Yes" changed my life.

00:00:57.910 --> 00:00:59.606
"Yes" changed me.

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:02.006
But there was one particular yes

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:04.966
that affected my life
in the most profound way,

00:01:04.990 --> 00:01:06.806
in a way I never imagined,

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:09.470
and it started with a question
from my toddler.

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.886
I have these three amazing daughters,
Harper, Beckett and Emerson,

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:17.406
and Emerson is a toddler who inexplicably
refers to everyone as "honey."

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.286
as though she's a Southern waitress.

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:20.526
(Laughter)

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:23.366
"Honey, I'm gonna need some milk
for my sippy cup."

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:25.006
(Laughter)

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:28.286
The Southern waitress asked me
to play with her one evening

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:31.086
when I was on my way somewhere,
and I said, "Yes."

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:35.126
And that yes was the beginning
of a new way of life for my family.

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:37.126
I made a vow that from now on,

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:39.486
every time one of my children
asks me to play,

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:42.046
no matter what I'm doing
or where I'm going,

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:45.670
I say yes, every single time.

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:50.046
Almost. I'm not perfect at it,
but I try hard to practice it.

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.486
And it's had a magical effect on me,

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:54.910
on my children, on our family.

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:58.606
But it's also had a stunning side effect,

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:02.206
and it wasn't until recently
that I fully understood it,

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:05.806
that I understood that saying yes
to playing with my children

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:07.990
likely saved my career.

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:12.046
See, I have what most people
would call a dream job.

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:14.846
I'm a writer. I imagine.
I make stuff up for a living.

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:16.326
Dream job.

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:17.686
No.

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:18.910
I'm a titan.

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:20.806
Dream job.

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:23.286
I create television.
I executive produce television.

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:26.406
I make television,
a great deal of television.

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:28.286
In one way or another, this TV season,

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:31.846
I'm responsible for bringing about
70 hours of programming to the world.

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:33.926
Four television programs,
70 hours of TV --

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:34.966
(Applause)

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:37.446
Three shows in production
at a time, sometimes four.

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:40.806
Each show creates hundreds of jobs
that didn't exist before.

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:43.086
The budget for one episode
of network television

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:45.486
can be anywhere
from three to six million dollars.

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:46.766
Let's just say five.

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:49.246
A new episode made every nine days
times four shows,

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:52.326
so every nine days that's
20 million dollars worth of television,

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:54.326
four television programs, 70 hours of TV,

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:56.806
three shows in production at a time,
sometimes four,

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:58.526
16 episodes going on at all times:

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:00.926
24 episodes of "Grey's,"
21 episodes of "Scandal,"

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:03.206
15 episodes of
"How To Get Away With Murder,"

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:05.606
10 episodes of "The Catch,"
that's 70 hours of TV,

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:07.566
that's 350 million dollars for a season.

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:09.126
In America, my television shows

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:11.166
are back to back to back
on Thursday night.

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:14.966
Around the world, my shows air
in 256 territories in 67 languages

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:16.806
for an audience of 30 million people.

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:18.510
My brain is global,

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:22.366
and 45 hours of that 70 hours of TV
are shows I personally created

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:24.846
and not just produced,
so on top of everything else,

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:28.406
I need to find time,
real quiet, creative time,

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:30.606
to gather my fans around the campfire

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:31.870
and tell my stories.

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:34.263
Four television programs, 70 hours of TV,

00:03:34.287 --> 00:03:36.006
three shows in production at a time,

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:40.070
sometimes four, 350 million dollars,
campfires burning all over the world.

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:42.350
You know who else is doing that?

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:45.686
Nobody, so like I said, I'm a titan.

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:46.966
Dream job.

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:48.206
(Applause)

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:50.486
Now, I don't tell you this to impress you.

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:54.646
I tell you this because I know what you
think of when you hear the word "writer."

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:57.575
I tell you this so that all of you
out there who work so hard,

00:03:57.599 --> 00:04:01.006
whether you run a company
or a country or a classroom

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:03.526
or a store or a home,

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:06.246
take me seriously
when I talk about working,

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:10.246
so you'll get that I don't
peck at a computer and imagine all day,

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:12.166
so you'll hear me when I say

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:15.670
that I understand that a dream job
is not about dreaming.

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:21.566
It's all job, all work, all reality,
all blood, all sweat, no tears.

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:25.390
I work a lot, very hard, and I love it.

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:28.326
When I'm hard at work,
when I'm deep in it,

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:30.846
there is no other feeling.

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:34.326
For me, my work is at all times
building a nation out of thin air.

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:37.126
It is manning the troops.
It is painting a canvas.

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:39.806
It is hitting every high note.
It is running a marathon.

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:41.446
It is being BeyoncÃ©.

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:44.390
And it is all of those things
at the same time.

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:46.726
I love working.

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:49.806
It is creative and mechanical
and exhausting and exhilarating

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:52.406
and hilarious and disturbing
and clinical and maternal

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:53.806
and cruel and judicious,

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:56.910
and what makes it all so good is the hum.

00:04:57.790 --> 00:05:01.006
There is some kind of shift inside me
when the work gets good.

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:02.926
A hum begins in my brain,

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:06.646
and it grows and it grows
and that hum sounds like the open road,

00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:08.670
and I could drive it forever.

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:11.931
And a lot of people,
when I try to explain the hum,

00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:14.886
they assume that I'm talking
about the writing,

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:16.366
that my writing brings me joy.

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:18.710
And don't get me wrong, it does.

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:20.750
But the hum --

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:23.806
it wasn't until I started
making television

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:26.046
that I started working, working and making

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:28.686
and building and creating
and collaborating,

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:33.150
that I discovered this thing,
this buzz, this rush, this hum.

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:35.966
The hum is more than writing.

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:39.246
The hum is action and activity.
The hum is a drug.

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:41.886
The hum is music.
The hum is light and air.

00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:45.270
The hum is God's whisper right in my ear.

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:47.550
And when you have a hum like that,

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:50.806
you can't help but strive for greatness.

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:55.430
That feeling, you can't help
but strive for greatness at any cost.

00:05:56.270 --> 00:05:57.470
That's called the hum.

00:05:58.270 --> 00:06:01.846
Or, maybe it's called being a workaholic.

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:03.526
(Laughter)

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:05.350
Maybe it's called genius.

00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:07.950
Maybe it's called ego.

00:06:08.670 --> 00:06:10.910
Maybe it's just fear of failure.

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:13.446
I don't know.

00:06:13.470 --> 00:06:17.286
I just know that
I'm not built for failure,

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:19.150
and I just know that I love the hum.

00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:22.246
I just know that I want
to tell you I'm a titan,

00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:24.726
and I know that
I don't want to question it.

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:25.950
But here's the thing:

00:06:27.230 --> 00:06:29.046
the more successful I become,

00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:32.686
the more shows, the more episodes,
the more barriers broken,

00:06:32.710 --> 00:06:34.190
the more work there is to do,

00:06:34.910 --> 00:06:36.166
the more balls in the air,

00:06:36.190 --> 00:06:39.086
the more eyes on me,
the more history stares,

00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:40.870
the more expectations there are.

00:06:41.430 --> 00:06:43.526
The more I work to be successful,

00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:44.910
the more I need to work.

00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:47.806
And what did I say about work?

00:06:47.830 --> 00:06:49.150
I love working, right?

00:06:49.790 --> 00:06:52.166
The nation I'm building,
the marathon I'm running,

00:06:52.190 --> 00:06:54.406
the troops, the canvas,
the high note, the hum,

00:06:54.430 --> 00:06:56.286
the hum, the hum.

00:06:56.310 --> 00:06:58.366
I like that hum. I love that hum.

00:06:58.390 --> 00:07:01.190
I need that hum. I am that hum.

00:07:01.750 --> 00:07:03.750
Am I nothing but that hum?

00:07:05.470 --> 00:07:06.910
And then the hum stopped.

00:07:07.830 --> 00:07:10.246
Overworked, overused,

00:07:10.270 --> 00:07:11.566
overdone, burned out.

00:07:11.590 --> 00:07:13.790
The hum stopped.

00:07:15.230 --> 00:07:17.806
Now, my three daughters
are used to the truth

00:07:17.830 --> 00:07:19.950
that their mother
is a single working titan.

00:07:20.710 --> 00:07:21.926
Harper tells people,

00:07:21.950 --> 00:07:24.790
"My mom won't be there,
but you can text my nanny."

00:07:25.390 --> 00:07:28.910
And Emerson says, "Honey,
I'm wanting to go to ShondaLand."

00:07:29.830 --> 00:07:31.206
They're children of a titan.

00:07:31.230 --> 00:07:33.030
They're baby titans.

00:07:33.670 --> 00:07:36.950
They were 12, 3, and 1
when the hum stopped.

00:07:37.870 --> 00:07:39.310
The hum of the engine died.

00:07:39.950 --> 00:07:42.446
I stopped loving work.
I couldn't restart the engine.

00:07:42.470 --> 00:07:44.446
The hum would not come back.

00:07:44.470 --> 00:07:46.790
My hum was broken.

00:07:47.630 --> 00:07:51.446
I was doing the same things
I always did, all the same titan work,

00:07:51.470 --> 00:07:53.926
15-hour days, working
straight through the weekends,

00:07:53.950 --> 00:07:57.286
no regrets, never surrender,
a titan never sleeps, a titan never quits,

00:07:57.310 --> 00:07:59.510
full hearts, clear eyes, yada, whatever.

00:08:00.150 --> 00:08:01.670
But there was no hum.

00:08:02.990 --> 00:08:04.750
Inside me was silence.

00:08:06.230 --> 00:08:09.926
Four television programs, 70 hours of TV,
three shows in production at a time,

00:08:09.950 --> 00:08:11.166
sometimes four.

00:08:11.190 --> 00:08:15.006
Four television programs, 70 hours of TV,
three shows in production at a time ...

00:08:15.030 --> 00:08:17.126
I was the perfect titan.

00:08:17.150 --> 00:08:19.470
I was a titan you could
take home to your mother.

00:08:20.670 --> 00:08:24.230
All the colors were the same,
and I was no longer having any fun.

00:08:24.710 --> 00:08:26.030
And it was my life.

00:08:26.950 --> 00:08:28.286
It was all I did.

00:08:28.310 --> 00:08:31.030
I was the hum, and the hum was me.

00:08:31.790 --> 00:08:34.366
So what do you do when the thing you do,

00:08:34.390 --> 00:08:37.070
the work you love,
starts to taste like dust?

00:08:38.030 --> 00:08:40.086
Now, I know somebody's out there thinking,

00:08:40.110 --> 00:08:42.486
"Cry me a river,
stupid writer titan lady."

00:08:42.510 --> 00:08:44.285
(Laughter)

00:08:44.309 --> 00:08:46.366
But you know, you do,

00:08:46.390 --> 00:08:49.165
if you make, if you work,
if you love what you do,

00:08:49.189 --> 00:08:52.246
being a teacher, being a banker,
being a mother, being a painter,

00:08:52.270 --> 00:08:53.486
being Bill Gates,

00:08:53.510 --> 00:08:56.846
if you simply love another person
and that gives you the hum,

00:08:56.870 --> 00:08:58.446
if you know the hum,

00:08:58.470 --> 00:09:02.486
if you know what the hum feels like,
if you have been to the hum,

00:09:02.510 --> 00:09:05.550
when the hum stops, who are you?

00:09:06.790 --> 00:09:07.990
What are you?

00:09:08.910 --> 00:09:10.326
What am I?

00:09:10.350 --> 00:09:12.230
Am I still a titan?

00:09:13.230 --> 00:09:17.990
If the song of my heart ceases to play,
can I survive in the silence?

00:09:19.990 --> 00:09:23.230
And then my Southern waitress toddler
asks me a question.

00:09:24.070 --> 00:09:27.966
I'm on my way out the door,
I'm late, and she says,

00:09:27.990 --> 00:09:30.270
"Momma, wanna play?"

00:09:31.030 --> 00:09:34.366
And I'm just about to say no,
when I realize two things.

00:09:34.390 --> 00:09:36.990
One, I'm supposed
to say yes to everything,

00:09:37.590 --> 00:09:40.830
and two, my Southern waitress
didn't call me "honey."

00:09:41.710 --> 00:09:43.990
She's not calling everyone
"honey" anymore.

00:09:44.790 --> 00:09:46.486
When did that happen?

00:09:46.510 --> 00:09:48.966
I'm missing it, being a titan
and mourning my hum,

00:09:48.990 --> 00:09:51.910
and here she is changing
right before my eyes.

00:09:52.590 --> 00:09:55.670
And so she says, "Momma, wanna play?"

00:09:56.110 --> 00:09:57.390
And I say, "Yes."

00:09:58.310 --> 00:10:00.726
There's nothing special about it.

00:10:00.750 --> 00:10:03.446
We play, and we're joined by her sisters,

00:10:03.470 --> 00:10:04.926
and there's a lot of laughing,

00:10:04.950 --> 00:10:08.566
and I give a dramatic reading
from the book Everybody Poops.

00:10:08.590 --> 00:10:09.966
Nothing out of the ordinary.

00:10:09.990 --> 00:10:11.086
(Laughter)

00:10:11.110 --> 00:10:13.286
And yet, it is extraordinary,

00:10:13.310 --> 00:10:15.806
because in my pain and my panic,

00:10:15.830 --> 00:10:17.886
in the homelessness of my humlessness,

00:10:17.910 --> 00:10:20.470
I have nothing to do but pay attention.

00:10:20.910 --> 00:10:22.326
I focus.

00:10:22.350 --> 00:10:23.550
I am still.

00:10:24.310 --> 00:10:26.686
The nation I'm building,
the marathon I'm running,

00:10:26.710 --> 00:10:29.670
the troops, the canvas,
the high note does not exist.

00:10:30.550 --> 00:10:32.486
All that exists are sticky fingers

00:10:32.510 --> 00:10:35.846
and gooey kisses
and tiny voices and crayons

00:10:35.870 --> 00:10:37.446
and that song about letting go

00:10:37.470 --> 00:10:40.486
of whatever it is that Frozen girl
needs to let go of.

00:10:40.510 --> 00:10:42.446
(Laughter)

00:10:42.470 --> 00:10:44.630
It's all peace and simplicity.

00:10:46.030 --> 00:10:50.246
The air is so rare in this place for me
that I can barely breathe.

00:10:50.270 --> 00:10:52.430
I can barely believe I'm breathing.

00:10:53.070 --> 00:10:55.750
Play is the opposite of work.

00:10:56.670 --> 00:10:58.070
And I am happy.

00:10:58.830 --> 00:11:00.206
Something in me loosens.

00:11:00.230 --> 00:11:02.550
A door in my brain swings open,

00:11:03.470 --> 00:11:04.966
and a rush of energy comes.

00:11:04.990 --> 00:11:09.246
And it's not instantaneous,
but it happens, it does happen.

00:11:09.270 --> 00:11:10.470
I feel it.

00:11:10.790 --> 00:11:12.070
A hum creeps back.

00:11:12.630 --> 00:11:15.326
Not at full volume, barely there,

00:11:15.350 --> 00:11:18.646
it's quiet, and I have to stay
very still to hear it, but it is there.

00:11:18.670 --> 00:11:21.390
Not the hum, but a hum.

00:11:22.030 --> 00:11:25.190
And now I feel like I know
a very magical secret.

00:11:25.950 --> 00:11:28.446
Well, let's not get carried away.

00:11:28.470 --> 00:11:31.550
It's just love. That's all it is.

00:11:32.390 --> 00:11:35.510
No magic. No secret. It's just love.

00:11:36.270 --> 00:11:37.790
It's just something we forgot.

00:11:38.710 --> 00:11:42.206
The hum, the work hum,
the hum of the titan,

00:11:42.230 --> 00:11:43.590
that's just a replacement.

00:11:44.150 --> 00:11:46.526
If I have to ask you who I am,

00:11:46.550 --> 00:11:48.486
if I have to tell you who I am,

00:11:48.510 --> 00:11:50.966
if I describe myself in terms of shows

00:11:50.990 --> 00:11:55.246
and hours of television
and how globally badass my brain is,

00:11:55.270 --> 00:11:58.190
I have forgotten what the real hum is.

00:11:58.830 --> 00:12:02.550
The hum is not power
and the hum is not work-specific.

00:12:03.030 --> 00:12:04.590
The hum is joy-specific.

00:12:05.150 --> 00:12:07.446
The real hum is love-specific.

00:12:07.470 --> 00:12:11.126
The hum is the electricity
that comes from being excited by life.

00:12:11.150 --> 00:12:13.886
The real hum is confidence and peace.

00:12:13.910 --> 00:12:16.406
The real hum ignores the stare of history,

00:12:16.430 --> 00:12:19.446
and the balls in the air,
and the expectation, and the pressure.

00:12:19.470 --> 00:12:22.030
The real hum is singular and original.

00:12:22.630 --> 00:12:24.686
The real hum is God's whisper in my ear,

00:12:24.710 --> 00:12:27.086
but maybe God was whispering
the wrong words,

00:12:27.110 --> 00:12:29.968
because which one of the gods
was telling me I was the titan?

00:12:30.950 --> 00:12:32.150
It's just love.

00:12:33.070 --> 00:12:36.046
We could all use a little more love,

00:12:36.070 --> 00:12:37.430
a lot more love.

00:12:38.430 --> 00:12:40.590
Any time my child asks me to play,

00:12:41.070 --> 00:12:42.390
I will say yes.

00:12:43.390 --> 00:12:45.286
I make it a firm rule for one reason,

00:12:45.310 --> 00:12:46.566
to give myself permission,

00:12:46.590 --> 00:12:48.870
to free me from all
of my workaholic guilt.

00:12:49.390 --> 00:12:51.686
It's a law, so I don't have a choice,

00:12:51.710 --> 00:12:53.846
and I don't have a choice,

00:12:53.870 --> 00:12:55.430
not if I want to feel the hum.

00:12:56.150 --> 00:12:57.886
I wish it were that easy,

00:12:57.910 --> 00:13:01.486
but I'm not good at playing.

00:13:01.510 --> 00:13:03.070
I don't like it.

00:13:04.590 --> 00:13:08.950
I'm not interested in doing it
the way I'm interested in doing work.

00:13:09.550 --> 00:13:12.806
The truth is incredibly humbling
and humiliating to face.

00:13:12.830 --> 00:13:14.566
I don't like playing.

00:13:14.590 --> 00:13:17.366
I work all the time
because I like working.

00:13:17.390 --> 00:13:21.270
I like working more
than I like being at home.

00:13:22.150 --> 00:13:25.910
Facing that fact
is incredibly difficult to handle,

00:13:26.870 --> 00:13:32.870
because what kind of person
likes working more than being at home?

00:13:33.790 --> 00:13:35.510
Well, me.

00:13:36.070 --> 00:13:39.326
I mean, let's be honest,
I call myself a titan.

00:13:39.350 --> 00:13:40.726
I've got issues.

00:13:40.750 --> 00:13:42.366
(Laughter)

00:13:42.390 --> 00:13:45.406
And one of those issues
isn't that I am too relaxed.

00:13:45.430 --> 00:13:47.526
(Laughter)

00:13:47.550 --> 00:13:51.230
We run around the yard,
up and back and up and back.

00:13:51.870 --> 00:13:54.326
We have 30-second dance parties.

00:13:54.350 --> 00:13:56.910
We sing show tunes. We play with balls.

00:13:57.390 --> 00:13:59.486
I blow bubbles and they pop them.

00:13:59.510 --> 00:14:04.470
And I feel stiff and delirious
and confused most of the time.

00:14:04.950 --> 00:14:07.630
I itch for my cell phone always.

00:14:08.230 --> 00:14:10.046
But it is OK.

00:14:10.070 --> 00:14:14.926
My tiny humans show me how to live
and the hum of the universe fills me up.

00:14:14.950 --> 00:14:17.926
I play and I play until I begin to wonder

00:14:17.950 --> 00:14:20.950
why we ever stop playing
in the first place.

00:14:21.630 --> 00:14:22.910
You can do it too,

00:14:23.630 --> 00:14:26.550
say yes every time
your child asks you to play.

00:14:27.750 --> 00:14:30.646
Are you thinking that maybe
I'm an idiot in diamond shoes?

00:14:30.670 --> 00:14:33.486
You're right, but you can still do this.

00:14:33.510 --> 00:14:35.166
You have time.

00:14:35.190 --> 00:14:38.926
You know why? Because you're not Rihanna
and you're not a Muppet.

00:14:38.950 --> 00:14:41.326
Your child does not think
you're that interesting.

00:14:41.350 --> 00:14:42.486
(Laughter)

00:14:42.510 --> 00:14:44.486
You only need 15 minutes.

00:14:44.510 --> 00:14:47.286
My two- and four-year-old
only ever want to play with me

00:14:47.310 --> 00:14:48.726
for about 15 minutes or so

00:14:48.750 --> 00:14:51.766
before they think to themselves
they want to do something else.

00:14:51.790 --> 00:14:55.366
It's an amazing 15 minutes,
but it's 15 minutes.

00:14:55.390 --> 00:14:59.366
If I'm not a ladybug or a piece of candy,
I'm invisible after 15 minutes.

00:14:59.390 --> 00:15:00.406
(Laughter)

00:15:00.430 --> 00:15:05.166
And my 13-year-old, if I can get
a 13-year-old to talk to me for 15 minutes

00:15:05.190 --> 00:15:06.526
I'm Parent of the Year.

00:15:06.550 --> 00:15:08.206
(Laughter)

00:15:08.230 --> 00:15:09.966
15 minutes is all you need.

00:15:09.990 --> 00:15:14.630
I can totally pull off 15 minutes
of uninterrupted time on my worst day.

00:15:15.270 --> 00:15:17.366
Uninterrupted is the key.

00:15:17.390 --> 00:15:20.286
No cell phone, no laundry, no anything.

00:15:20.310 --> 00:15:23.046
You have a busy life.
You have to get dinner on the table.

00:15:23.070 --> 00:15:26.206
You have to force them to bathe.
But you can do 15 minutes.

00:15:26.230 --> 00:15:28.646
My kids are my happy place,
they're my world,

00:15:28.670 --> 00:15:31.166
but it doesn't have to be your kids,

00:15:31.190 --> 00:15:32.606
the fuel that feeds your hum,

00:15:32.630 --> 00:15:35.286
the place where life
feels more good than not good.

00:15:35.310 --> 00:15:37.806
It's not about playing with your kids,

00:15:37.830 --> 00:15:39.086
it's about joy.

00:15:39.110 --> 00:15:41.470
It's about playing in general.

00:15:42.310 --> 00:15:44.246
Give yourself the 15 minutes.

00:15:44.270 --> 00:15:46.446
Find what makes you feel good.

00:15:46.470 --> 00:15:49.750
Just figure it out and play in that arena.

00:15:51.070 --> 00:15:55.246
I'm not perfect at it.
In fact, I fail as often as I succeed,

00:15:55.270 --> 00:15:58.110
seeing friends, reading books,
staring into space.

00:15:58.790 --> 00:16:01.846
"Wanna play?" starts to become shorthand
for indulging myself

00:16:01.870 --> 00:16:06.086
in ways I'd given up on right around
the time I got my first TV show,

00:16:06.110 --> 00:16:08.846
right around the time
I became a titan-in-training,

00:16:08.870 --> 00:16:12.270
right around the time I started
competing with myself for ways unknown.

00:16:13.390 --> 00:16:16.886
15 minutes? What could be wrong
with giving myself my full attention

00:16:16.910 --> 00:16:18.230
for 15 minutes?

00:16:18.670 --> 00:16:20.510
Turns out, nothing.

00:16:21.110 --> 00:16:25.166
The very act of not working has made it
possible for the hum to return,

00:16:25.190 --> 00:16:28.630
as if the hum's engine
could only refuel while I was away.

00:16:29.750 --> 00:16:32.270
Work doesn't work without play.

00:16:33.550 --> 00:16:36.190
It takes a little time,
but after a few months,

00:16:36.750 --> 00:16:38.366
one day the floodgates open

00:16:38.390 --> 00:16:41.766
and there's a rush, and I find myself
standing in my office

00:16:41.790 --> 00:16:45.886
filled with an unfamiliar melody,
full on groove inside me,

00:16:45.910 --> 00:16:48.686
and around me, and it sends me
spinning with ideas,

00:16:48.710 --> 00:16:51.766
and the humming road is open,
and I can drive it and drive it,

00:16:51.790 --> 00:16:53.550
and I love working again.

00:16:54.150 --> 00:16:57.886
But now, I like that hum,
but I don't love that hum.

00:16:57.910 --> 00:16:59.166
I don't need that hum.

00:16:59.190 --> 00:17:02.366
I am not that hum. That hum is not me,

00:17:02.390 --> 00:17:03.590
not anymore.

00:17:04.190 --> 00:17:07.886
I am bubbles and sticky fingers
and dinners with friends.

00:17:07.910 --> 00:17:09.110
I am that hum.

00:17:09.550 --> 00:17:10.886
Life's hum.

00:17:10.910 --> 00:17:12.206
Love's hum.

00:17:12.230 --> 00:17:16.469
Work's hum is still a piece of me,
it is just no longer all of me,

00:17:17.030 --> 00:17:18.550
and I am so grateful.

00:17:19.350 --> 00:17:21.446
And I don't give a crap
about being a titan,

00:17:21.469 --> 00:17:24.630
because I have never once seen a titan
play Red Rover, Red Rover.

00:17:26.030 --> 00:17:30.325
I said yes to less work and more play,
and somehow I still run my world.

00:17:30.350 --> 00:17:33.310
My brain is still global.
My campfires still burn.

00:17:34.110 --> 00:17:37.509
The more I play, the happier I am,
and the happier my kids are.

00:17:38.070 --> 00:17:41.326
The more I play,
the more I feel like a good mother.

00:17:41.350 --> 00:17:43.806
The more I play,
the freer my mind becomes.

00:17:43.830 --> 00:17:45.726
The more I play, the better I work.

00:17:45.750 --> 00:17:48.246
The more I play, the more I feel the hum,

00:17:48.270 --> 00:17:50.646
the nation I'm building,
the marathon I'm running,

00:17:50.670 --> 00:17:53.290
the troops, the canvas,
the high note, the hum, the hum,

00:17:53.314 --> 00:17:55.714
the other hum, the real hum,

00:17:56.150 --> 00:17:57.606
life's hum.

00:17:57.630 --> 00:17:58.886
The more I feel that hum,

00:17:58.910 --> 00:18:02.446
the more this strange,
quivering, uncocooned,

00:18:02.470 --> 00:18:03.806
awkward, brand new,

00:18:03.830 --> 00:18:06.350
alive non-titan feels like me.

00:18:07.270 --> 00:18:10.150
The more I feel that hum,
the more I know who I am.

00:18:10.710 --> 00:18:13.830
I'm a writer, I make stuff up, I imagine.

00:18:14.550 --> 00:18:17.406
That part of the job,
that's living the dream.

00:18:17.430 --> 00:18:19.510
That's the dream of the job.

00:18:20.110 --> 00:18:23.030
Because a dream job
should be a little bit dreamy.

00:18:23.990 --> 00:18:26.910
I said yes to less work and more play.

00:18:27.830 --> 00:18:29.510
Titans need not apply.

00:18:30.310 --> 00:18:31.510
Wanna play?

00:18:32.110 --> 00:18:33.326
Thank you.

00:18:33.350 --> 00:18:43.030
(Applause)
