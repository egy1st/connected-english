WEBVTT

00:00:13.023 --> 00:00:16.230
1.3 billion years ago,

00:00:16.254 --> 00:00:19.324
in a distant, distant galaxy,

00:00:19.348 --> 00:00:22.702
two black holes locked into a spiral,

00:00:22.726 --> 00:00:24.805
falling inexorably towards each other

00:00:25.384 --> 00:00:26.758
and collided,

00:00:26.782 --> 00:00:29.725
converting three Suns' worth of stuff

00:00:29.749 --> 00:00:32.578
into pure energy in a tenth of a second.

00:00:33.919 --> 00:00:35.951
For that brief moment in time,

00:00:36.688 --> 00:00:40.100
the glow was brighter than all the stars

00:00:40.124 --> 00:00:41.785
in all the galaxies

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:43.833
in all of the known Universe.

00:00:44.576 --> 00:00:45.964
It was a very

00:00:46.376 --> 00:00:47.527
big

00:00:47.551 --> 00:00:48.701
bang.

00:00:50.447 --> 00:00:53.261
But they didn't release
their energy in light.

00:00:53.285 --> 00:00:55.641
I mean, you know, they're black holes.

00:00:57.379 --> 00:01:02.220
All that energy was pumped
into the fabric of space and time itself,

00:01:02.244 --> 00:01:05.857
making the Universe explode
in gravitational waves.

00:01:05.881 --> 00:01:08.975
Let me give you a sense
of the timescale at work here.

00:01:09.467 --> 00:01:12.078
1.3 billion years ago,

00:01:12.102 --> 00:01:15.217
Earth had just managed to evolve
multicellular life.

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:20.052
Since then, Earth has made and evolved

00:01:20.076 --> 00:01:25.467
corals, fish, plants, dinosaurs, people
and even -- God save us -- the Internet.

00:01:26.213 --> 00:01:28.728
And about 25 years ago,

00:01:28.752 --> 00:01:30.770
a particularly audacious set of people --

00:01:30.794 --> 00:01:36.173
Rai Weiss at MIT, Kip Thorne
and Ronald Drever at Caltech --

00:01:36.197 --> 00:01:37.991
decided that it would be really neat

00:01:38.015 --> 00:01:40.728
to build a giant laser detector

00:01:40.752 --> 00:01:43.134
with which to search
for the gravitational waves

00:01:43.158 --> 00:01:45.410
from things like colliding black holes.

00:01:46.458 --> 00:01:48.564
Now, most people thought they were nuts.

00:01:49.437 --> 00:01:53.351
But enough people realized
that they were brilliant nuts

00:01:53.375 --> 00:01:58.414
that the US National Science Foundation
decided to fund their crazy idea.

00:01:58.438 --> 00:02:01.783
So after decades of development,

00:02:01.807 --> 00:02:04.286
construction and imagination

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:08.294
and a breathtaking amount of hard work,

00:02:08.318 --> 00:02:11.469
they built their detector, called LIGO:

00:02:11.493 --> 00:02:15.190
The Laser Interferometer
Gravitational-Wave Observatory.

00:02:16.801 --> 00:02:18.111
For the last several years,

00:02:18.135 --> 00:02:21.734
LIGO's been undergoing
a huge expansion in its accuracy,

00:02:21.758 --> 00:02:24.750
a tremendous improvement
in its detection ability.

00:02:24.774 --> 00:02:27.120
It's now called Advanced LIGO as a result.

00:02:28.266 --> 00:02:30.512
In early September of 2015,

00:02:31.155 --> 00:02:34.011
LIGO turned on for a final test run

00:02:34.035 --> 00:02:36.889
while they sorted out
a few lingering details.

00:02:38.128 --> 00:02:42.406
And on September 14 of 2015,

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:45.921
just days after the detector
had gone live,

00:02:46.992 --> 00:02:50.779
the gravitational waves
from those colliding black holes

00:02:50.803 --> 00:02:52.278
passed through the Earth.

00:02:53.127 --> 00:02:55.166
And they passed through you and me.

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:57.761
And they passed through the detector.

00:02:59.293 --> 00:03:01.794
(Audio) Scott Hughes:
There's two moments in my life

00:03:01.818 --> 00:03:03.509
more emotionally intense than that.

00:03:03.533 --> 00:03:05.072
One is the birth of my daughter.

00:03:05.096 --> 00:03:09.183
The other is when I had to say goodbye
to my father when he was terminally ill.

00:03:10.201 --> 00:03:13.372
You know, it was the payoff
of my career, basically.

00:03:14.641 --> 00:03:20.296
Everything I'd been working on --
it's no longer science fiction! (Laughs)

00:03:21.566 --> 00:03:25.736
Allan Adams: So that's my very good friend
and collaborator, Scott Hughes,

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:27.951
a theoretical physicist at MIT,

00:03:27.975 --> 00:03:30.760
who has been studying
gravitational waves from black holes

00:03:30.784 --> 00:03:34.313
and the signals that they could impart
on observatories like LIGO,

00:03:34.337 --> 00:03:36.352
for the past 23 years.

00:03:37.042 --> 00:03:40.798
So let me take a moment to tell you
what I mean by a gravitational wave.

00:03:41.639 --> 00:03:44.707
A gravitational wave is a ripple

00:03:44.731 --> 00:03:47.160
in the shape of space and time.

00:03:47.618 --> 00:03:49.629
As the wave passes by,

00:03:49.653 --> 00:03:52.032
it stretches space and everything in it

00:03:52.056 --> 00:03:53.215
in one direction,

00:03:53.239 --> 00:03:55.230
and compresses it in the other.

00:03:56.043 --> 00:03:59.092
This has led to countless instructors
of general relativity

00:03:59.116 --> 00:04:03.048
doing a really silly dance to demonstrate
in their classes on general relativity.

00:04:03.072 --> 00:04:05.829
"It stretches and expands,
it stretches and expands."

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:10.406
So the trouble with gravitational waves

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:13.048
is that they're very weak;
they're preposterously weak.

00:04:13.452 --> 00:04:16.850
For example, the waves that hit us
on September 14 --

00:04:16.874 --> 00:04:21.568
and yes, every single one of you
stretched and compressed

00:04:21.592 --> 00:04:23.162
under the action of that wave --

00:04:23.884 --> 00:04:26.789
when the waves hit, they stretched
the average person

00:04:26.813 --> 00:04:29.924
by one part in 10 to the 21.

00:04:29.948 --> 00:04:32.820
That's a decimal place, 20 zeroes,

00:04:32.844 --> 00:04:34.010
and a one.

00:04:35.669 --> 00:04:39.134
That's why everyone thought
the LIGO people were nuts.

00:04:39.673 --> 00:04:45.555
Even with a laser detector five kilometers
long -- and that's already crazy --

00:04:45.579 --> 00:04:48.457
they would have to measure
the length of those detectors

00:04:49.228 --> 00:04:53.209
to less than one thousandth
of the radius of the nucleus

00:04:53.233 --> 00:04:54.391
of an atom.

00:04:54.415 --> 00:04:56.255
And that's preposterous.

00:04:56.630 --> 00:04:59.774
So towards the end
of his classic text on gravity,

00:05:00.647 --> 00:05:03.420
LIGO co-founder Kip Thorne

00:05:04.658 --> 00:05:07.645
described the hunt
for gravitational waves as follows:

00:05:07.669 --> 00:05:10.820
He said, "The technical difficulties
to be surmounted

00:05:10.844 --> 00:05:13.157
in constructing such detectors

00:05:13.181 --> 00:05:14.446
are enormous.

00:05:15.724 --> 00:05:17.796
But physicists are ingenious,

00:05:18.558 --> 00:05:21.558
and with the support
of a broad lay public,

00:05:22.122 --> 00:05:25.097
all obstacles will surely be overcome."

00:05:26.288 --> 00:05:29.808
Thorne published that in 1973,

00:05:29.832 --> 00:05:33.156
42 years before he succeeded.

00:05:35.299 --> 00:05:36.558
Now, coming back to LIGO,

00:05:36.582 --> 00:05:39.796
Scott likes to say that LIGO
acts like an ear

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:41.398
more than it does like an eye.

00:05:41.779 --> 00:05:43.989
I want to explain what that means.

00:05:44.013 --> 00:05:46.335
Visible light has a wavelength, a size,

00:05:46.359 --> 00:05:48.932
that's much smaller
than the things around you,

00:05:48.956 --> 00:05:50.455
the features on people's faces,

00:05:50.479 --> 00:05:53.232
the size of your cell phone.

00:05:53.732 --> 00:05:54.939
And that's really useful,

00:05:54.963 --> 00:05:58.170
because it lets you make an image
or a map of the things around you,

00:05:58.194 --> 00:06:00.582
by looking at the light
coming from different spots

00:06:00.606 --> 00:06:01.757
in the scene about you.

00:06:01.781 --> 00:06:03.724
Sound is different.

00:06:04.261 --> 00:06:07.711
Audible sound has a wavelength
that can be up to 50 feet long.

00:06:07.735 --> 00:06:09.512
And that makes it really difficult --

00:06:09.536 --> 00:06:12.576
in fact, in practical purposes,
impossible -- to make an image

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:14.418
of something you really care about.

00:06:14.442 --> 00:06:15.782
Your child's face.

00:06:16.927 --> 00:06:21.057
Instead, we use sound
to listen for features like pitch

00:06:21.081 --> 00:06:24.199
and tone and rhythm and volume

00:06:24.223 --> 00:06:27.596
to infer a story behind the sounds.

00:06:28.215 --> 00:06:30.069
That's Alice talking.

00:06:30.093 --> 00:06:31.626
That's Bob interrupting.

00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:32.900
Silly Bob.

00:06:33.959 --> 00:06:37.004
So, the same is true
of gravitational waves.

00:06:37.838 --> 00:06:42.902
We can't use them to make simple images
of things out in the Universe.

00:06:42.926 --> 00:06:44.602
But by listening to changes

00:06:44.626 --> 00:06:48.069
in the amplitude and frequency
of those waves,

00:06:48.093 --> 00:06:51.152
we can hear the story
that those waves are telling.

00:06:52.374 --> 00:06:53.915
And at least for LIGO,

00:06:53.939 --> 00:06:58.137
the frequencies that it can hear
are in the audio band.

00:06:58.161 --> 00:07:02.713
So if we convert the wave patterns
into pressure waves and air, into sound,

00:07:03.271 --> 00:07:06.049
we can literally hear
the Universe speaking to us.

00:07:07.239 --> 00:07:11.370
For example, listening to gravity,
just in this way,

00:07:11.394 --> 00:07:14.084
can tell us a lot about the collision
of two black holes,

00:07:14.108 --> 00:07:17.902
something my colleague Scott has spent
an awful lot of time thinking about.

00:07:17.926 --> 00:07:20.397
(Audio) SH: If the two black holes
are non-spinning,

00:07:20.421 --> 00:07:22.166
you get a very simple chirp: whoop!

00:07:22.619 --> 00:07:26.272
If the two bodies are spinning
very rapidly, I have that same chirp,

00:07:26.296 --> 00:07:28.018
but with a modulation on top of it,

00:07:28.042 --> 00:07:30.407
so it kind of goes: whir, whir, whir!

00:07:30.431 --> 00:07:34.982
It's sort of the vocabulary of spin
imprinted on this waveform.

00:07:35.363 --> 00:07:38.650
AA: So on September 14, 2015,

00:07:38.674 --> 00:07:41.600
a date that's definitely
going to live in my memory,

00:07:41.624 --> 00:07:43.869
LIGO heard this:

00:07:43.893 --> 00:07:45.423
[Whirring sound]

00:07:46.566 --> 00:07:51.446
So if you know how to listen,
that is the sound of --

00:07:51.470 --> 00:07:54.684
(Audio) SH: ... two black holes,
each of about 30 solar masses,

00:07:54.708 --> 00:07:56.400
that were whirling around at a rate

00:07:56.424 --> 00:07:58.965
comparable to what goes on
in your blender.

00:07:59.481 --> 00:08:02.283
AA: It's worth pausing here
to think about what that means.

00:08:02.307 --> 00:08:05.592
Two black holes, the densest thing
in the Universe,

00:08:05.616 --> 00:08:07.796
one with a mass of 29 Suns

00:08:07.820 --> 00:08:10.607
and one with a mass of 36 Suns,

00:08:10.631 --> 00:08:13.304
whirling around each other
100 times per second

00:08:13.328 --> 00:08:14.486
before they collide.

00:08:14.510 --> 00:08:16.223
Just imagine the power of that.

00:08:16.969 --> 00:08:18.207
It's fantastic.

00:08:19.317 --> 00:08:22.072
And we know it because we heard it.

00:08:23.977 --> 00:08:26.357
That's the lasting importance of LIGO.

00:08:27.199 --> 00:08:30.908
It's an entirely new way
to observe the Universe

00:08:30.932 --> 00:08:32.789
that we've never had before.

00:08:32.813 --> 00:08:35.877
It's a way that lets us hear the Universe

00:08:35.901 --> 00:08:37.511
and hear the invisible.

00:08:39.646 --> 00:08:41.944
And there's a lot out there
that we can't see --

00:08:42.706 --> 00:08:44.334
in practice or even in principle.

00:08:44.358 --> 00:08:46.367
So supernova, for example:

00:08:46.391 --> 00:08:50.835
I would love to know why very massive
stars explode in supernovae.

00:08:50.859 --> 00:08:52.010
They're very useful;

00:08:52.034 --> 00:08:54.378
we've learned a lot
about the Universe from them.

00:08:54.402 --> 00:08:57.409
The problem is, all the interesting
physics happens in the core,

00:08:57.433 --> 00:08:59.938
and the core is hidden behind
thousands of kilometers

00:08:59.962 --> 00:09:02.037
of iron and carbon and silicon.

00:09:02.061 --> 00:09:04.366
We'll never see through it,
it's opaque to light.

00:09:04.390 --> 00:09:08.306
Gravitational waves go through iron
as if it were glass --

00:09:08.330 --> 00:09:09.785
totally transparent.

00:09:10.662 --> 00:09:13.059
The Big Bang: I would love
to be able to explore

00:09:13.083 --> 00:09:15.922
the first few moments of the Universe,

00:09:15.946 --> 00:09:17.594
but we'll never see them,

00:09:17.618 --> 00:09:21.924
because the Big Bang itself
is obscured by its own afterglow.

00:09:22.853 --> 00:09:24.472
With gravitational waves,

00:09:25.067 --> 00:09:27.980
we should be able to see
all the way back to the beginning.

00:09:28.575 --> 00:09:30.369
Perhaps most importantly,

00:09:30.393 --> 00:09:32.831
I'm positive that there
are things out there

00:09:33.450 --> 00:09:35.041
that we've never seen

00:09:35.065 --> 00:09:36.818
that we may never be able to see

00:09:36.842 --> 00:09:38.683
and that we haven't even imagined --

00:09:40.119 --> 00:09:42.508
things that we'll only
discover by listening.

00:09:43.405 --> 00:09:46.065
And in fact, even
in that very first event,

00:09:46.089 --> 00:09:49.135
LIGO found things that we didn't expect.

00:09:49.714 --> 00:09:53.205
Here's my colleague and one of the key
members of the LIGO collaboration,

00:09:53.229 --> 00:09:56.867
Matt Evans, my colleague at MIT,
addressing exactly that:

00:09:56.891 --> 00:10:00.101
(Audio) Matt Evans: The kinds of stars
which produce the black holes

00:10:00.125 --> 00:10:01.387
that we observed here

00:10:01.411 --> 00:10:03.189
are the dinosaurs of the Universe.

00:10:03.213 --> 00:10:06.888
They're these massive things
that are old, from prehistoric times,

00:10:06.912 --> 00:10:09.558
and the black holes are kind of like
the dinosaur bones

00:10:09.582 --> 00:10:11.200
with which we do this archeology.

00:10:11.224 --> 00:10:13.772
So it lets us really get
a whole nother angle

00:10:13.796 --> 00:10:15.677
on what's out there in the Universe

00:10:15.701 --> 00:10:18.464
and how the stars came to be,
and in the end, of course,

00:10:18.488 --> 00:10:21.187
how we came to be out of this whole mess.

00:10:22.454 --> 00:10:24.106
AA: Our challenge now

00:10:24.130 --> 00:10:27.224
is to be as audacious as possible.

00:10:27.990 --> 00:10:30.892
Thanks to LIGO, we know how
to build exquisite detectors

00:10:30.916 --> 00:10:32.485
that can listen to the Universe,

00:10:32.509 --> 00:10:35.580
to the rustle and the chirp of the cosmos.

00:10:36.040 --> 00:10:39.228
Our job is to dream up and build
new observatories --

00:10:39.252 --> 00:10:41.283
a whole new generation of observatories --

00:10:41.307 --> 00:10:43.306
on the ground, in space.

00:10:43.709 --> 00:10:48.535
I mean, what could be more glorious
than listening to the Big Bang itself?

00:10:49.123 --> 00:10:50.861
Our job now is to dream big.

00:10:51.702 --> 00:10:52.933
Dream with us.

00:10:52.957 --> 00:10:54.116
Thank you.

00:10:54.140 --> 00:10:57.663
