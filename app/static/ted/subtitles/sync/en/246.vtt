00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:14.150
The first idea I'd like to suggest is that we all

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:17.150
love music a great deal. It means a lot to us.

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:23.150
But music is even more powerful if you don't just listen to it, but you make it yourself.

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:26.150
So, that's my first idea. And we all know about the Mozart effect --

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:29.150
the idea that's been around for the last five to 10 years --

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:33.150
that just by listening to music or by playing music to your baby [in utero],

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:37.150
that it'll raise our IQ points 10, 20, 30 percent.

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:40.150
Great idea, but it doesn't work at all.

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:43.150
So, you can't just listen to music, you have to make it somehow.

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:47.150
And I'd add to that, that it's not just making it,

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:49.150
but everybody, each of us, everybody in the world

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:53.150
has the power to create and be part of music in a very dynamic way,

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:55.150
and that's one of the main parts of my work.

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:57.150
So, with the MIT Media Lab, for quite a while now,

00:00:57.150 --> 00:00:59.150
we've been engaged in a field called active music.

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:01.150
What are all the possible ways that we can think of

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:04.150
to get everybody in the middle of a musical experience,

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:07.150
not just listening, but making music?

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:10.150
And we started by making instruments for some of the world's greatest performers --

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:13.150
we call these hyperinstruments -- for Yo-Yo Ma, Peter Gabriel, Prince,

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:17.150
orchestras, rock bands. Instruments where they're all kinds of sensors

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:20.150
built right into the instrument, so the instrument knows how it's being played.

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:23.150
And just by changing the interpretation and the feeling,

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:26.150
I can turn my cello into a voice, or into a whole orchestra,

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:29.150
or into something that nobody has ever heard before.

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:31.150
When we started making these, I started thinking, why can't we make

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:33.150
wonderful instruments like that for everybody,

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:37.150
people who aren't fantastic Yo-Yo Mas or Princes?

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:39.150
So, we've made a whole series of instruments.

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:42.150
One of the largest collections is called the Brain Opera.

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.150
It's a whole orchestra of about 100 instruments,

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:47.150
all designed for anybody to play using natural skill.

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:50.150
So, you can play a video game, drive through a piece of music,

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:53.150
use your body gesture to control huge masses of sound,

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:58.150
touch a special surface to make melodies, use your voice to make a whole aura.

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:00.150
And when we make the Brain Opera, we invite the public to come in,

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:03.150
to try these instruments and then collaborate with us

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:04.150
to help make each performance of the Brain Opera.

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:07.150
We toured that for a long time. It is now permanently in Vienna,

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:09.150
where we built a museum around it.

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:12.150
And that led to something which you probably do know.

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:13.150
Guitar Hero came out of our lab,

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:16.150
and my two teenage daughters and most of the students at the MIT Media Lab

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:19.150
are proof that if you make the right kind of interface,

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:23.150
people are really interested in being in the middle of a piece of music,

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:26.150
and playing it over and over and over again.

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:29.150
So, the model works, but it's only the tip of the iceberg,

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:32.150
because my second idea is that it's not enough just to want

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:35.150
to make music in something like Guitar Hero.

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:38.150
And music is very fun, but it's also transformative.

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:39.150
It's very, very important.

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:42.150
Music can change your life, more than almost anything.

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:44.150
It can change the way you communicate with others,

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:47.150
it can change your body, it can change your mind. So, we're trying

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:51.150
to go to the next step of how you build on top of something like Guitar Hero.

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:54.150
We are very involved in education. We have a long-term project

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:58.150
called Toy Symphony, where we make all kinds of instruments that are also addictive,

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:02.150
but for little kids, so the kids will fall in love with making music,

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:05.150
want to spend their time doing it, and then will demand to know how it works,

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:08.150
how to make more, how to create. So, we make squeezy instruments,

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:12.150
like these Music Shapers that measure the electricity in your fingers,

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:15.150
Beatbugs that let you tap in rhythms -- they gather your rhythm,

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:17.150
and like hot potato, you send your rhythm to your friends,

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:20.150
who then have to imitate or respond to what your doing --

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:24.150
and a software package called Hyperscore, which lets anybody use lines and color

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:28.150
to make quite sophisticated music. Extremely easy to use, but once you use it,

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:32.150
you can go quite deep -- music in any style. And then, by pressing a button,

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:38.150
it turns into music notation so that live musicians can play your pieces.

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:41.150
We've had good enough, really, very powerful effects with kids

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:44.150
around the world, and now people of all ages, using Hyperscore.

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:48.150
So, we've gotten more and more interested in using these kinds of creative activities

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:50.150
in a much broader context, for all kinds of people

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:53.150
who don't usually have the opportunity to make music.

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:54.150
So, one of the growing fields that we're working on

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:57.150
at the Media Lab right now is music, mind and health.

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:00.150
A lot of you have probably seen Oliver Sacks' wonderful new book called

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:04.150
"Musicophilia". It's on sale in the bookstore. It's a great book.

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:06.150
If you haven't seen it, it's worth reading. He's a pianist himself,

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:10.150
and he details his whole career of looking at and observing

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:15.150
incredibly powerful effects that music has had on peoples' lives in unusual situations.

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:18.150
So we know, for instance, that music is almost always the last thing

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:22.150
that people with advanced Alzheimer's can still respond to.

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:24.150
Maybe many of you have noticed this with loved ones,

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:26.150
you can find somebody who can't recognize their face in the mirror,

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:29.150
or can't tell anyone in their family, but you can still find a shard of music

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:33.150
that that person will jump out of the chair and start singing. And with that

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:35.150
you can bring back parts of people's memories and personalities.

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:39.150
Music is the best way to restore speech to people who have lost it through strokes,

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:41.150
movement to people with Parkinson's disease.

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:45.150
It's very powerful for depression, schizophrenia, many, many things.

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:47.150
So, we're working on understanding those underlying principles

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:51.150
and then building activities which will let music really improve people's health.

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:54.150
And we do this in many ways. We work with many different hospitals.

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:57.150
One of them is right near Boston, called Tewksbury Hospital.

00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:59.150
It's a long-term state hospital, where several years ago

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:03.150
we started working with Hyperscore and patients with physical and mental disabilities.

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:07.150
This has become a central part of the treatment at Tewksbury hospital,

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:11.150
so everybody there clamors to work on musical activities.

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:15.150
It's the activity that seems to accelerate people's treatment the most

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:19.150
and it also brings the entire hospital together as a kind of musical community.

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:23.150
I wanted to show you a quick video of some of this work before I go on.

00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:06.150
Video: They're manipulating each other's rhythms.

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:10.150
It's a real experience, not only to learn how to play and listen to rhythms,

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:15.150
but to train your musical memory and playing music in a group.

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:19.150
To get their hands on music, to shape it themselves, change it,

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:21.150
to experiment with it, to make their own music.

00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:25.150
So Hyperscore lets you start from scratch very quickly.

00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:34.150
Everybody can experience music in a profound way,

00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:36.150
we just have to make different tools.

00:06:53.150 --> 00:06:59.150
The third idea I want to share with you is that music, paradoxically,

00:06:59.150 --> 00:07:02.150
I think even more than words, is one of the very best ways we have

00:07:02.150 --> 00:07:06.150
of showing who we really are. I love giving talks, although

00:07:06.150 --> 00:07:08.150
strangely I feel more nervous giving talks than playing music.

00:07:08.150 --> 00:07:11.150
If I were here playing cello, or playing on a synth, or sharing my music with you,

00:07:11.150 --> 00:07:16.150
I'd be able to show things about myself that I can't tell you in words,

00:07:16.150 --> 00:07:19.150
more personal things, perhaps deeper things.

00:07:19.150 --> 00:07:22.150
I think that's true for many of us, and I want to give you two examples

00:07:22.150 --> 00:07:25.150
of how music is one of the most powerful interfaces we have,

00:07:25.150 --> 00:07:27.150
from ourselves to the outside world.

00:07:27.150 --> 00:07:31.150
The first is a really crazy project that we're building right now, called

00:07:31.150 --> 00:07:33.150
Death and the Powers. And it's a big opera,

00:07:33.150 --> 00:07:37.150
one of the larger opera projects going on in the world right now.

00:07:37.150 --> 00:07:42.150
And it's about a man, rich, successful, powerful, who wants to live forever.

00:07:42.150 --> 00:07:44.150
So, he figures out a way to download himself into his environment,

00:07:44.150 --> 00:07:47.150
actually into a series of books.

00:07:47.150 --> 00:07:50.150
So this guy wants to live forever, he downloads himself into his environment.

00:07:50.150 --> 00:07:54.150
The main singer disappears at the beginning of the opera

00:07:54.150 --> 00:07:58.150
and the entire stage becomes the main character. It becomes his legacy.

00:07:58.150 --> 00:08:01.150
And the opera is about what we can share, what we can pass on to others,

00:08:01.150 --> 00:08:03.150
to the people we love, and what we can't.

00:08:03.150 --> 00:08:07.150
Every object in the opera comes alive and is a gigantic music instrument,

00:08:07.150 --> 00:08:10.150
like this chandelier. It takes up the whole stage. It looks like a chandelier,

00:08:10.150 --> 00:08:12.150
but it's actually a robotic music instrument.

00:08:12.150 --> 00:08:16.150
So, as you can see in this prototype, gigantic piano strings,

00:08:16.150 --> 00:08:19.150
each string is controlled with a little robotic element --

00:08:19.150 --> 00:08:24.150
either little bows that stroke the strings, propellers that tickle the strings,

00:08:24.150 --> 00:08:29.150
acoustic signals that vibrate the strings. We also have an army of robots on stage.

00:08:29.150 --> 00:08:33.150
These robots are the kind of the intermediary between the main character, Simon Powers,

00:08:33.150 --> 00:08:37.150
and his family. There are a whole series of them, kind of like a Greek chorus.

00:08:37.150 --> 00:08:42.150
They observe the action. We've designed these square robots that we're testing right now

00:08:42.150 --> 00:08:45.150
at MIT called OperaBots. These OperaBots follow my music.

00:08:45.150 --> 00:08:48.150
They follow the characters. They're smart enough, we hope,

00:08:48.150 --> 00:08:51.150
not to bump into each other. They go off on their own.

00:08:51.150 --> 00:08:57.150
And then they can also, when you snap, line up exactly the way you'd like to.

00:08:57.150 --> 00:08:59.150
Even though they're cubes, they actually have a lot of personality.

00:09:06.150 --> 00:09:10.150
The largest set piece in the opera is called The System. It's a series of books.

00:09:10.150 --> 00:09:14.150
Every single book is robotic, so they all move, they all make sound,

00:09:14.150 --> 00:09:18.150
and when you put them all together, they turn into these walls,

00:09:18.150 --> 00:09:23.150
which have the gesture and the personality of Simon Powers. So he's disappeared,

00:09:23.150 --> 00:09:26.150
but the whole physical environment becomes this person.

00:09:26.150 --> 00:09:29.150
This is how he's chosen to represent himself.

00:09:29.150 --> 00:09:36.150
The books also have high-packed LEDs on the spines. So it's all display.

00:09:36.150 --> 00:09:40.150
And here's the great baritone James Maddalena as he enters The System.

00:09:40.150 --> 00:09:41.150
This is a sneak preview.

00:10:05.150 --> 00:10:10.150
This premieres in Monaco -- it's in September 2009. If by any chance you can't make it,

00:10:10.150 --> 00:10:13.150
another idea with this project -- here's this guy building his legacy

00:10:13.150 --> 00:10:17.150
through this very unusual form, through music and through the environment.

00:10:17.150 --> 00:10:21.150
But we're also making this available both online and in public spaces,

00:10:21.150 --> 00:10:25.150
as a way of each of us to use music and images from our lives

00:10:25.150 --> 00:10:28.150
to make our own legacy or to make a legacy of someone we love.

00:10:28.150 --> 00:10:31.150
So instead of being grand opera, this opera will turn into what we're

00:10:31.150 --> 00:10:33.150
thinking of as personal opera.

00:10:33.150 --> 00:10:35.150
And, if you're going to make a personal opera, what about a personal instrument?

00:10:35.150 --> 00:10:38.150
Everything I've shown you so far -- whether it's a hyper-cello for Yo-Yo Ma

00:10:38.150 --> 00:10:43.150
or squeezy toy for a child -- the instruments stayed the same and are valuable

00:10:43.150 --> 00:10:46.150
for a certain class of person: a virtuoso, a child.

00:10:46.150 --> 00:10:49.150
But what if I could make an instrument that could be adapted

00:10:49.150 --> 00:10:53.150
to the way I personally behave, to the way my hands work,

00:10:53.150 --> 00:10:56.150
to what I do very skillfully, perhaps, to what I don't do so skillfully?

00:10:56.150 --> 00:11:01.150
I think that this is the future of interface, it's the future of music, the future of instruments.

00:11:01.150 --> 00:11:04.150
And I'd like now to invite two very special people on the stage,

00:11:04.150 --> 00:11:10.150
so that I can give you an example of what personal instruments might be like.

00:11:10.150 --> 00:11:15.150
So, can you give a hand to Adam Boulanger, Ph.D. student from

00:11:15.150 --> 00:11:22.150
the MIT Media Lab, and Dan Ellsey. Dan,

00:11:22.150 --> 00:11:29.150
thanks to TED and to Bombardier Flexjet, Dan is here with us today

00:11:29.150 --> 00:11:33.150
all the way from Tewksbury. He's a resident at Tewksbury Hospital.

00:11:33.150 --> 00:11:37.150
This is by far the farthest he's strayed from Tewksbury Hospital, I can tell you that,

00:11:37.150 --> 00:11:42.150
because he's motivated to meet with you today and show you his own music.

00:11:42.150 --> 00:11:46.150
So, first of all, Dan, do you want to say hi to everyone and tell everyone who you are?

00:11:51.150 --> 00:11:59.150
Dan Ellsey: Hello. My name is Dan Ellsey. I am 34 years old and I have cerebral palsy.

00:11:59.150 --> 00:12:05.150
I have always loved music and I am excited to be able to conduct

00:12:05.150 --> 00:12:07.150
my own music with this new software.

00:12:09.150 --> 00:12:20.150
Tod Machover: And we're really excited to have you here, really Dan. (Applause)

00:12:20.150 --> 00:12:23.150
So we met Dan about three years ago, three and a half years ago,

00:12:23.150 --> 00:12:28.150
when we started working at Tewksbury. Everybody we met there was fantastic,

00:12:28.150 --> 00:12:33.150
did fantastic music. Dan had never made music before, and it turned out

00:12:33.150 --> 00:12:40.150
he was really fantastic at it. He's a born composer.

00:12:40.150 --> 00:12:43.150
He's very shy, too.

00:12:43.150 --> 00:12:47.150
So, turned out he's a fantastic composer, and over the last few years has been

00:12:47.150 --> 00:12:50.150
a constant collaborator of ours. He has made many, many pieces.

00:12:50.150 --> 00:12:53.150
He makes his own CDs. Actually, he is quite well known in the Boston area --

00:12:53.150 --> 00:12:57.150
mentors people at the hospital and children, locally, in how to make their own music.

00:12:57.150 --> 00:13:02.150
And I'll let Adam tell you. So, Adam is a Ph.D. student at MIT, an expert in music

00:13:02.150 --> 00:13:07.150
technology and medicine. And Adam and Dan have become close collaborators.

00:13:07.150 --> 00:13:11.150
What Adam's been working on for this last period is not only how to have Dan

00:13:11.150 --> 00:13:14.150
be able easily to make his own pieces,

00:13:14.150 --> 00:13:17.150
but how he can perform his piece using this kind of personal instrument.

00:13:17.150 --> 00:13:19.150
So, you want to say a little bit about how you guys work?

00:13:19.150 --> 00:13:22.150
Adam Boulanger: Yes. So, Tod and I entered into a discussion

00:13:22.150 --> 00:13:26.150
following the Tewksbury work and it was really about how Dan is an expressive

00:13:26.150 --> 00:13:31.150
person, and he's an intelligent and creative person. And it's in his face,

00:13:31.150 --> 00:13:34.150
it's in his breathing, it's in his eyes. How come he can't perform

00:13:34.150 --> 00:13:38.150
one of his pieces of music? That's our responsibility, and it doesn't make sense.

00:13:38.150 --> 00:13:41.150
So we started developing a technology that will allow him with nuance,

00:13:41.150 --> 00:13:46.150
with precision, with control, and despite his physical disability, to be able to do that,

00:13:46.150 --> 00:13:49.150
to be able to perform his piece of music.

00:13:49.150 --> 00:13:51.150
So, the process and the technology --

00:13:51.150 --> 00:13:54.150
basically, first we needed an engineering solution. So, you know,

00:13:54.150 --> 00:13:57.150
we have a FireWire camera, it looked at an infrared pointer.

00:13:57.150 --> 00:14:01.150
We went with the type of gesture metaphor that Dan was already used to

00:14:01.150 --> 00:14:05.150
with his speaking controller.

00:14:05.150 --> 00:14:08.150
And this was actually the least interesting part of the work, you know,

00:14:08.150 --> 00:14:11.150
the design process. We needed an input; we needed continuous tracking;

00:14:11.150 --> 00:14:14.150
in the software, we look at the types of shapes he's making.

00:14:14.150 --> 00:14:18.150
But, then was the really interesting aspect of the work, following the engineering part,

00:14:18.150 --> 00:14:21.150
where, basically, we're coding over Dan's shoulder at the hospital

00:14:21.150 --> 00:14:24.150
extensively to figure out, you know, how does Dan move?

00:14:24.150 --> 00:14:26.150
What's useful to him as an expressive motion?

00:14:26.150 --> 00:14:29.150
You know, what's his metaphor for performance?

00:14:29.150 --> 00:14:31.150
What types of things does he find

00:14:31.150 --> 00:14:33.150
important to control and convey in a piece of music?

00:14:33.150 --> 00:14:37.150
So all the parameter fitting, and really the technology

00:14:37.150 --> 00:14:40.150
was stretched at that point to fit just Dan.

00:14:40.150 --> 00:14:46.150
And, you know, I think this is a perspective shift. It's not that our technologies --

00:14:46.150 --> 00:14:50.150
they provide access, they allow us to create pieces of creative work.

00:14:50.150 --> 00:14:53.150
But what about expression? What about that moment when an artist delivers

00:14:53.150 --> 00:14:57.150
that piece of work? You know, do our technologies allow us to express?

00:14:57.150 --> 00:15:01.150
Do they provide structure for us to do that? And, you know, that's a personal relationship

00:15:01.150 --> 00:15:05.150
to expression that is lacking in the technological sphere. So, you know,

00:15:05.150 --> 00:15:08.150
with Dan, we needed a new design process, a new engineering process

00:15:08.150 --> 00:15:13.150
to sort of discover his movement and his path to expression that allow him to perform.

00:15:13.150 --> 00:15:15.150
And so that's what we'll do today.

00:15:15.150 --> 00:15:17.150
TM: So let's do it. So Dan do you want to tell everyone

00:15:17.150 --> 00:15:19.150
about what you're going to play now?

00:15:25.150 --> 00:15:27.150
DE: This is "My Eagle Song."

00:15:29.150 --> 00:15:32.150
TM: So Dan is going to play a piece of his, called "My Eagle Song".

00:15:32.150 --> 00:15:34.150
In fact, this is the score for Dan's piece,

00:15:34.150 --> 00:15:37.150
completely composed by Dan in Hyperscore.

00:15:37.150 --> 00:15:42.150
So he can use his infrared tracker to go directly into Hyperscore.

00:15:42.150 --> 00:15:45.150
He's incredibly fast at it, too, faster than I am, in fact.

00:15:45.150 --> 00:15:47.150
(Laughter)

00:15:49.150 --> 00:15:51.150
TM: He's really modest, too.

00:15:52.150 --> 00:15:58.150
So he can go in Hyperscore. You start out by making melodies and rhythms.

00:15:58.150 --> 00:16:00.150
He can place those exactly where he wants.

00:16:00.150 --> 00:16:03.150
Each one gets a color. He goes back into the composition window,

00:16:03.150 --> 00:16:08.150
draws the lines, places everything the way he wants to. Looking at the Hyperscore,

00:16:08.150 --> 00:16:11.150
you can see it also, you can see where the sections are,

00:16:11.150 --> 00:16:16.150
something might continue for a while, change, get really crazy and then end

00:16:16.150 --> 00:16:19.150
up with a big bang at the end.

00:16:19.150 --> 00:16:22.150
So that's the way he made his piece, and as Adam says,

00:16:22.150 --> 00:16:29.150
we then figured out the best way to have him perform his piece.

00:16:29.150 --> 00:16:32.150
It's going to be looked at by this camera, analyze his movements,

00:16:32.150 --> 00:16:36.150
it's going to let Dan bring out all the different aspects of his music that he wants to.

00:16:36.150 --> 00:16:39.150
And you're also going to notice a visual on the screen.

00:16:39.150 --> 00:16:45.150
We asked one of our students to look at what the camera is measuring.

00:16:45.150 --> 00:16:48.150
But instead of making it very literal, showing you exactly

00:16:48.150 --> 00:16:53.150
the camera tracing, we turned it into a graphic that shows you the basic

00:16:53.150 --> 00:16:57.150
movement, and shows the way it's being analyzed.

00:16:57.150 --> 00:17:01.150
I think it gives an understanding of how we're picking out movement from what

00:17:01.150 --> 00:17:05.150
Dan's doing, but I think it will also show you, if you look at that movement,

00:17:05.150 --> 00:17:12.150
that when Dan makes music, his motions are very purposeful, very precise,

00:17:12.150 --> 00:17:15.150
very disciplined and they're also very beautiful.

00:17:15.150 --> 00:17:20.150
So, in hearing this piece, as I mentioned before, the most important thing is

00:17:20.150 --> 00:17:23.150
the music's great, and it'll show you who Dan is.

00:17:23.150 --> 00:17:25.150
So, are we ready Adam?

00:17:25.150 --> 00:17:27.150
AB: Yeah.

00:17:27.150 --> 00:17:31.150
TM: OK, now Dan will play his piece "My Eagle Song" for you.

00:19:55.150 --> 00:20:19.150
(Applause)

00:20:19.150 --> 00:20:21.150
TM: Bravo.

00:20:21.150 --> 00:20:30.150
(Applause)
