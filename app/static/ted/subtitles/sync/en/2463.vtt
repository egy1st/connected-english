WEBVTT

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:16.966
It has been 128 years

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:20.550
since the last country
in the world abolished slavery

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:23.806
and 53 years

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:28.910
since Martin Luther King pronounced
his "I Have A Dream" speech.

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:32.126
But we still live in a world

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:37.350
where the color of our skin
not only gives a first impression,

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:40.910
but a lasting one that remains.

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:47.526
I was born in a family full of colors.

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.566
My father is the son of a maid

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:55.670
from whom he inherited
an intense dark chocolate tone.

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:01.126
He was adopted by those
who I know as my grandparents.

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:03.406
The matriarch, my grandma,

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:07.030
has a porcelain skin and cotton-like hair.

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:13.446
My grandpa was somewhere between
a vanilla and strawberry yogurt tone,

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.110
like my uncle and my cousin.

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:23.686
My mother is a cinnamon-skin
daughter of a native Brazilian,

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:26.390
with a pinch of hazel and honey,

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:30.006
and a man [who is]
a mix of coffee with milk,

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:31.750
but with a lot of coffee.

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:34.806
She has two sisters.

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:37.726
One in a toasted-peanut skin

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:39.166
and the other,

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:40.726
also adopted,

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:42.646
more on the beige side,

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:43.966
like a pancake.

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:45.366
(Laughter)

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.246
Growing up in this family,

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.870
color was never important for me.

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:56.190
Outside home, however,
things were different soon.

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:01.030
Color had many other meanings.

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:06.086
I remember my first
drawing lessons in school

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:09.046
as a bunch of contradictory feelings.

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:12.006
It was exciting and creative

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:16.830
but I never understood
the unique flesh-colored pencil.

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:20.885
I was made of flesh but I wasn't pink.

00:02:20.909 --> 00:02:24.686
My skin was brown,
and people said I was black.

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:28.870
I was seven years old
with a mess of colors in my head.

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:31.310
Later,

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:34.526
when I took my cousin to school,

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:36.950
I was usually taken for the nanny.

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:41.126
By helping in the kitchen
at a friend's party,

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:43.270
people thought I was the maid.

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:46.846
I was even treated like a prostitute

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:51.390
just because I was walking alone
on the beach with European friends.

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:53.406
And many times,

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:58.006
visiting my grandma or friends
in upper class buildings,

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:02.966
I was invited not to use
the main elevator.

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:05.366
Because in the end,

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:08.086
with this color and this hair,

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:11.030
I cannot belong to some places.

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:13.766
In some way,

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:17.326
I get to used to it and accept part of it.

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:22.150
However, something inside of me
keeps revolving and struggling.

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:27.030
Years later I married a Spaniard.

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:29.766
But not any Spaniard.

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:33.686
I chose one with the skin color
of a lobster when sunburnt.

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:35.726
(Laughter)

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:40.086
Since then, a new question
started to chase me.

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:42.470
What will be the color of your children?

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:45.830
As you can understand,
this is my last concern.

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:49.126
But thinking about it,

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:51.086
with my previous background,

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:57.206
my story led me to make
my personal exercise as a photographer.

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:00.070
And that is how Humanae was born.

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:05.726
Humanae is a pursuit
to highlight our true colors,

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:07.406
rather than the untrue

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:12.846
white, red, black or yellow
associated with race.

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:17.206
It's a kind of game to question our codes.

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:22.286
It's a work in progress
from a personal story to a global history.

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:27.030
I portray the subjects
in a white background.

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:32.926
Then I choose an 11-pixel
square from the nose,

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:34.590
paint the background,

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:39.470
and look for the corresponding color
in the industrial palette, Pantone.

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:43.606
I started with my family and friends,

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:47.526
then more and more people
joined the adventure,

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:51.310
thanks to public calls
coming through the social media.

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:57.166
I thought that the main space
to show my work was the Internet

00:04:57.190 --> 00:05:01.726
because I want an open concept
that invites everybody

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:06.030
to push the share button
in both the computer and their brain.

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:11.270
The snowball started to roll.

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:15.150
The project had a great welcome --

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:19.366
invitations, exhibitions,

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:21.126
physical formats,

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:23.150
galleries and museums ...

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:25.686
just happened.

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:28.270
And among them, my favorite:

00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:32.470
when Humanae occupies public spaces

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:35.630
and appears in the street,

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:39.190
it fosters a popular debate

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:43.430
and creates a feeling of community.

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:51.046
I have portrayed more than 3,000 people

00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:53.686
in 13 different countries,

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:56.766
19 different cities around the world.

00:05:56.790 --> 00:05:59.326
Just to mention some of them --

00:05:59.350 --> 00:06:01.886
from someone included in the Forbes list,

00:06:01.910 --> 00:06:05.366
to refugees who crossed
the Mediterranean by boat.

00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:09.806
In Paris, from the UNESCO
Headquarters to a shelter.

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:14.750
And students both in Switzerland
and favelas in Rio de Janeiro.

00:06:15.510 --> 00:06:17.486
All kinds of beliefs,

00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:19.046
gender identities

00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:20.670
or physical impairments,

00:06:21.310 --> 00:06:24.286
a newborn or terminally ill.

00:06:24.310 --> 00:06:27.150
We all together build Humanae.

00:06:29.190 --> 00:06:33.790
Those portraits make us rethink
how we see each other.

00:06:34.270 --> 00:06:38.126
When modern science
is questioning the race concept,

00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:44.030
what does it mean for us
to be black, white, yellow, red?

00:06:44.710 --> 00:06:49.230
Is it the eye, the nose,
the mouth, the hair?

00:06:49.870 --> 00:06:53.206
Or does it have to do with our origin,

00:06:53.230 --> 00:06:54.486
nationality

00:06:54.510 --> 00:06:55.870
or bank account?

00:06:59.030 --> 00:07:03.390
This personal exercise
turned out to be a discovery.

00:07:03.790 --> 00:07:10.006
Suddenly I realized that Humanae
was useful for many people.

00:07:10.030 --> 00:07:12.286
It represents a sort of mirror

00:07:12.310 --> 00:07:16.870
for those who cannot find
themselves reflected in any label.

00:07:17.470 --> 00:07:18.766
It was amazing

00:07:18.790 --> 00:07:22.150
that people started to share
their thoughts about the work with me.

00:07:23.230 --> 00:07:25.206
I have hundreds of that,

00:07:25.230 --> 00:07:27.030
I will share with you, too.

00:07:28.030 --> 00:07:30.030
A mother of 11 years --

00:07:30.910 --> 00:07:34.550
A mother of an 11-year-old girl wrote me,

00:07:35.230 --> 00:07:39.006
"Very good for me as a tool
to work on her confidence,

00:07:39.030 --> 00:07:41.086
as this past weekend

00:07:41.110 --> 00:07:46.046
one of her girlfriends argued with her
that she does not belong

00:07:46.070 --> 00:07:49.310
and should not be allowed
to live in Norway.

00:07:50.150 --> 00:07:54.086
So your work has
a very special place in my heart

00:07:54.110 --> 00:07:55.910
and it's very important for me."

00:07:59.030 --> 00:08:02.710
A woman shared her portrait
on Facebook and wrote,

00:08:03.790 --> 00:08:05.006
"All my life,

00:08:05.030 --> 00:08:10.126
people from across the globe
had difficulties to place me in a group,

00:08:10.150 --> 00:08:11.606
a stereotype,

00:08:11.630 --> 00:08:12.926
a box.

00:08:12.950 --> 00:08:15.126
Perhaps we should stop.

00:08:15.150 --> 00:08:18.286
Instead of framing, ask the individual,

00:08:18.310 --> 00:08:20.606
'How would you label yourself?'

00:08:20.630 --> 00:08:22.446
Then I would say,

00:08:22.470 --> 00:08:24.486
'Hi. I'm Massiel.

00:08:24.510 --> 00:08:26.046
I'm a Dominican-Dutch,

00:08:26.070 --> 00:08:28.086
I grew up in a mixed family

00:08:28.110 --> 00:08:29.990
and I'm a bisexual woman.' "

00:08:32.030 --> 00:08:36.126
Besides these unexpected
and touching reactions,

00:08:36.150 --> 00:08:40.806
Humanae finds a new life
in a different variety of fields.

00:08:40.830 --> 00:08:42.990
Just to show you some examples,

00:08:43.830 --> 00:08:46.045
illustrators and art students

00:08:46.069 --> 00:08:50.165
using it as a reference
for their sketches and their studies.

00:08:50.189 --> 00:08:52.230
It's a collection of faces.

00:08:52.990 --> 00:08:56.926
Researchers in the fields of anthropology,

00:08:56.950 --> 00:08:59.246
physics and neuroscience

00:08:59.270 --> 00:09:03.406
use Humanae with different
scientific approaches

00:09:03.430 --> 00:09:06.046
related to human ethnicity,

00:09:06.070 --> 00:09:07.806
optophysiology,

00:09:07.830 --> 00:09:09.566
face recognition

00:09:09.590 --> 00:09:10.790
or Alzheimer's.

00:09:12.150 --> 00:09:15.566
One of the most important
impacts of the project

00:09:15.590 --> 00:09:20.246
is that Humanae was chosen
to be the cover of Foreign Affairs,

00:09:20.270 --> 00:09:24.350
one of the most relevant
political publications.

00:09:24.910 --> 00:09:28.406
And talking about foreign affairs,

00:09:28.430 --> 00:09:32.150
I found the perfect
ambassadors for my project ...

00:09:32.830 --> 00:09:34.046
teachers.

00:09:34.070 --> 00:09:40.030
They are the ones that use Humanae
as a tool for educational purposes.

00:09:41.030 --> 00:09:46.486
Their passion encourages me
to go back to drawing classes,

00:09:46.510 --> 00:09:49.350
but this time as a teacher myself.

00:09:50.350 --> 00:09:51.806
My students,

00:09:51.830 --> 00:09:54.086
both adults and kids,

00:09:54.110 --> 00:09:56.886
paint their self-portraits,

00:09:56.910 --> 00:10:01.390
trying to discover
their own unique color.

00:10:08.870 --> 00:10:10.886
As a photographer,

00:10:10.910 --> 00:10:16.510
I realize that I can be a channel
for others to communicate.

00:10:17.190 --> 00:10:19.006
As an individual,

00:10:19.030 --> 00:10:20.310
as Angélica,

00:10:21.230 --> 00:10:24.406
every time I take a picture,

00:10:24.430 --> 00:10:28.630
I feel that I am sitting
in front of a therapist.

00:10:29.630 --> 00:10:34.566
All the frustration, fear and loneliness

00:10:34.590 --> 00:10:36.030
that I once felt ...

00:10:36.510 --> 00:10:37.750
becomes love.

00:10:41.550 --> 00:10:42.950
The last country --

00:10:44.150 --> 00:10:49.166
the last country in the world
who abolished slavery

00:10:49.190 --> 00:10:51.510
is the country where I was born,

00:10:52.070 --> 00:10:53.270
Brazil.

00:10:54.590 --> 00:10:59.350
We still have to work hard
to abolish discrimination.

00:11:00.230 --> 00:11:04.206
That remains a common practice worldwide,

00:11:04.230 --> 00:11:07.830
and that will not disappear by itself.

00:11:08.630 --> 00:11:09.886
Thank you.

00:11:09.910 --> 00:11:23.980
(Applause)

00:11:24.030 --> 00:11:25.230
Thank you.
