00:00:13.948 --> 00:00:16.421
I was three months pregnant with twins

00:00:16.445 --> 00:00:19.789
when my husband Ross and I
went to my second sonogram.

00:00:21.371 --> 00:00:23.689
I was 35 years old at the time,

00:00:23.713 --> 00:00:27.033
and I knew that that meant
we had a higher risk

00:00:27.057 --> 00:00:29.001
of having a child with a birth defect.

00:00:30.057 --> 00:00:33.115
So, Ross and I researched
the standard birth defects,

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:35.139
and we felt reasonably prepared.

00:00:36.123 --> 00:00:38.068
Well, nothing would have prepared us

00:00:38.092 --> 00:00:41.146
for the bizarre diagnosis
that we were about to face.

00:00:42.441 --> 00:00:45.980
The doctor explained
that one of our twins, Thomas,

00:00:46.004 --> 00:00:48.828
had a fatal birth defect
called anencephaly.

00:00:49.626 --> 00:00:53.020
This means that his brain
was not formed correctly

00:00:53.044 --> 00:00:55.020
because part of his skull was missing.

00:00:55.813 --> 00:00:59.337
Babies with this diagnosis
typically die in utero

00:00:59.361 --> 00:01:02.932
or within a few minutes, hours
or days of being born.

00:01:05.163 --> 00:01:08.378
But the other twin, Callum,

00:01:08.402 --> 00:01:12.290
appeared to be healthy,
as far as the doctor could tell,

00:01:12.314 --> 00:01:16.481
and these twins were identical,

00:01:16.505 --> 00:01:17.774
genetically identical.

00:01:20.275 --> 00:01:24.887
So after a lot of questions about
how this could have possibly happened,

00:01:24.911 --> 00:01:28.047
a selective reduction was mentioned,

00:01:28.071 --> 00:01:30.972
and while this procedure
was not impossible,

00:01:30.996 --> 00:01:35.354
it posed some unique risks
for the healthy twin and for me,

00:01:35.378 --> 00:01:37.735
so we decided to carry
the pregnancy to term.

00:01:39.251 --> 00:01:43.442
So there I was, three months pregnant,
with two trimesters ahead of me,

00:01:43.466 --> 00:01:48.345
and I had to find a way to manage
my blood pressure and my stress.

00:01:49.418 --> 00:01:54.354
And it felt like having a roommate
point a loaded gun at you for six months.

00:01:55.703 --> 00:02:00.633
But I stared down
the barrel of that gun for so long

00:02:00.657 --> 00:02:02.720
that I saw a light
at the end of the tunnel.

00:02:03.656 --> 00:02:06.760
While there was nothing we could do
to prevent the tragedy,

00:02:06.784 --> 00:02:09.247
I wanted to find a way
for Thomas's brief life

00:02:09.271 --> 00:02:11.492
to have some kind of positive impact.

00:02:11.516 --> 00:02:15.182
So I asked my nurse about organ,
eye and tissue donation.

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:19.751
She connected with our local
organ-procurement organization,

00:02:19.775 --> 00:02:22.068
the Washington Regional
Transplant Community.

00:02:23.509 --> 00:02:26.080
WRTC explained to me

00:02:26.104 --> 00:02:30.505
that Thomas would probably be too small
at birth to donate for transplant,

00:02:30.529 --> 00:02:31.679
and I was shocked:

00:02:31.703 --> 00:02:34.107
I didn't even know
you could be rejected for that.

00:02:34.131 --> 00:02:37.543
But they said that he would be
a good candidate to donate for research.

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:40.471
This helped me see Thomas in a new light.

00:02:40.495 --> 00:02:43.390
As opposed to just a victim of a disease,

00:02:43.414 --> 00:02:47.001
I started to see him as a possible key
to unlock a medical mystery.

00:02:48.438 --> 00:02:51.716
On March 23, 2010,

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:54.247
the twins were born,
and they were both born alive.

00:02:56.128 --> 00:02:57.794
And just like the doctor said,

00:02:57.818 --> 00:03:00.897
Thomas was missing
the top part of his skull,

00:03:00.921 --> 00:03:02.444
but he could nurse,

00:03:02.468 --> 00:03:03.920
drink from a bottle,

00:03:03.944 --> 00:03:07.243
cuddle and grab our fingers
like a normal baby,

00:03:07.267 --> 00:03:08.864
and he slept in our arms.

00:03:10.203 --> 00:03:13.592
After six days, Thomas died in Ross's arms

00:03:13.616 --> 00:03:15.012
surrounded by our family.

00:03:16.996 --> 00:03:21.131
We called WRTC, who sent a van to our home

00:03:21.155 --> 00:03:23.694
and brought him to Children's
National Medical Center.

00:03:24.901 --> 00:03:28.722
A few hours later, we got a call to say
that the recovery was a success,

00:03:28.746 --> 00:03:31.980
and Thomas's donations
would be going to four different places.

00:03:32.309 --> 00:03:34.705
His cord blood would go
to Duke University.

00:03:35.358 --> 00:03:39.373
His liver would go to a cell-therapy
company called Cytonet in Durham.

00:03:40.413 --> 00:03:43.658
His corneas would go
to Schepens Eye Research Institute,

00:03:43.682 --> 00:03:45.841
which is part of Harvard Medical School,

00:03:45.865 --> 00:03:48.721
and his retinas would go
to the University of Pennsylvania.

00:03:50.233 --> 00:03:54.161
A few days later, we had a funeral
with our immediate family,

00:03:54.185 --> 00:03:56.129
including baby Callum,

00:03:56.153 --> 00:03:59.467
and we basically
closed this chapter in our lives.

00:03:59.868 --> 00:04:02.784
But I did find myself wondering,
what's happening now?

00:04:03.205 --> 00:04:04.872
What are the researchers learning?

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:07.573
And was it even worthwhile to donate?

00:04:09.169 --> 00:04:12.891
WRTC invited Ross and I
to a grief retreat,

00:04:12.915 --> 00:04:15.668
and we met about
15 other grieving families

00:04:15.692 --> 00:04:18.319
who had donated their loved one's
organs for transplant.

00:04:19.644 --> 00:04:22.045
Some of them had even received letters

00:04:22.069 --> 00:04:25.038
from the people who received
their loved one's organs,

00:04:25.062 --> 00:04:26.227
saying thank you.

00:04:27.188 --> 00:04:29.377
I learned that they
could even meet each other

00:04:29.401 --> 00:04:30.839
if they'd both sign a waiver,

00:04:30.863 --> 00:04:32.259
almost like an open adoption.

00:04:33.057 --> 00:04:35.896
And I was so excited,
I thought maybe I could write a letter

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:38.529
or I could get a letter
and learn about what happened.

00:04:38.553 --> 00:04:40.092
But I was disappointed to learn

00:04:40.116 --> 00:04:43.286
that this process only exists
for people who donate for transplant.

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:46.572
So I was jealous.
I had transplant envy, I guess.

00:04:46.596 --> 00:04:47.746
(Laughter)

00:04:48.254 --> 00:04:50.150
But over the years that followed,

00:04:50.174 --> 00:04:52.650
I learned a lot more about donation,

00:04:52.674 --> 00:04:54.752
and I even got a job in the field.

00:04:54.776 --> 00:04:56.189
And I came up with an idea.

00:04:58.029 --> 00:04:59.688
I wrote a letter that started out,

00:04:59.712 --> 00:05:00.878
"Dear Researcher."

00:05:02.618 --> 00:05:04.468
I explained who I was,

00:05:04.492 --> 00:05:08.360
and I asked if they could tell me
why they requested infant retinas

00:05:08.384 --> 00:05:10.619
in March of 2010,

00:05:10.643 --> 00:05:12.912
and I asked if my family
could visit their lab.

00:05:14.103 --> 00:05:17.199
I emailed it to the eye bank
that arranged the donation,

00:05:17.223 --> 00:05:19.601
the Old Dominion Eye Foundation,

00:05:19.625 --> 00:05:22.117
and asked if they could
send it to the right person.

00:05:22.545 --> 00:05:24.776
They said that they had
never done this before,

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:26.689
and they couldn't guarantee a response,

00:05:26.713 --> 00:05:29.529
but they wouldn't be an obstacle,
and they would deliver it.

00:05:30.656 --> 00:05:32.847
Two days later, I got a response

00:05:32.871 --> 00:05:35.855
from Dr. Arupa Ganguly
of the University of Pennsylvania.

00:05:36.767 --> 00:05:38.389
She thanked me for the donation,

00:05:38.413 --> 00:05:41.136
and she explained
that she is studying retinoblastoma,

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:42.977
which is a deadly cancer of the retina

00:05:43.001 --> 00:05:45.127
that affects children
under the age of five,

00:05:45.151 --> 00:05:47.841
and she said that yes,
we were invited to visit her lab.

00:05:48.762 --> 00:05:50.404
So next we talked on the phone,

00:05:50.428 --> 00:05:52.475
and one of the first things she said to me

00:05:52.499 --> 00:05:55.330
was that she couldn't possibly
imagine how we felt,

00:05:55.354 --> 00:05:58.094
and that Thomas had given
the ultimate sacrifice,

00:05:58.118 --> 00:06:00.205
and that she seemed
to feel indebted to us.

00:06:00.859 --> 00:06:03.985
So I said, "Nothing against your study,

00:06:04.009 --> 00:06:05.675
but we didn't actually pick it.

00:06:05.699 --> 00:06:08.857
We donated to the system,
and the system chose your study.

00:06:09.643 --> 00:06:14.533
I said, "And second of all,
bad things happen to children every day,

00:06:14.557 --> 00:06:16.345
and if you didn't want these retinas,

00:06:16.369 --> 00:06:18.899
they would probably
be buried in the ground right now.

00:06:18.923 --> 00:06:22.289
So to be able to participate in your study

00:06:22.313 --> 00:06:25.956
gives Thomas's life
a new layer of meaning.

00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:28.924
So, never feel guilty
about using this tissue."

00:06:29.995 --> 00:06:32.529
Next, she explained to me how rare it was.

00:06:32.553 --> 00:06:36.249
She had placed a request
for this tissue six years earlier

00:06:36.273 --> 00:06:38.486
with the National Disease
Research Interchange.

00:06:39.310 --> 00:06:42.644
She got only one sample of tissue
that fit her criteria,

00:06:42.668 --> 00:06:43.873
and it was Thomas's.

00:06:45.108 --> 00:06:48.838
Next, we arranged a date for me
to come visit the lab,

00:06:48.862 --> 00:06:53.512
and we chose March 23, 2015,
which was the twins' fifth birthday.

00:06:54.713 --> 00:06:58.649
After we hung up, I emailed her
some pictures of Thomas and Callum,

00:06:58.673 --> 00:07:01.562
and a few weeks later,
we received this T-shirt in the mail.

00:07:03.292 --> 00:07:06.091
A few months later, Ross, Callum
and I piled in the car

00:07:06.115 --> 00:07:07.706
and we went for a road trip.

00:07:07.730 --> 00:07:10.294
We met Arupa and her staff,

00:07:10.318 --> 00:07:14.566
and Arupa said that when I told her
not to feel guilty, that it was a relief,

00:07:14.590 --> 00:07:16.891
and that she hadn't seen it
from our perspective.

00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:22.478
She also explained that Thomas
had a secret code name.

00:07:23.081 --> 00:07:26.450
The same way Henrietta Lacks
is called HeLa,

00:07:26.474 --> 00:07:29.100
Thomas was called RES 360.

00:07:29.544 --> 00:07:30.942
RES means research,

00:07:30.966 --> 00:07:34.466
and 360 means he was the 360th specimen

00:07:34.490 --> 00:07:36.275
over the course of about 10 years.

00:07:37.283 --> 00:07:41.426
She also shared with us a unique document,

00:07:41.450 --> 00:07:43.935
and it was the shipping label

00:07:43.959 --> 00:07:47.443
that sent his retinas
from DC to Philadelphia.

00:07:48.423 --> 00:07:51.812
This shipping label
is like an heirloom to us now.

00:07:52.454 --> 00:07:55.962
It's the same way that a military medal
or a wedding certificate might be.

00:07:56.837 --> 00:08:02.237
Arupa also explained that she is using
Thomas's retina and his RNA

00:08:02.261 --> 00:08:05.671
to try to inactivate the gene
that causes tumor formation,

00:08:05.695 --> 00:08:08.805
and she even showed us some results
that were based on RES 360.

00:08:10.109 --> 00:08:11.943
Then she took us to the freezer

00:08:11.967 --> 00:08:15.402
and she showed us the two samples
that she still has

00:08:15.426 --> 00:08:17.748
that are still labeled RES 360.

00:08:17.772 --> 00:08:19.632
There's two little ones left.

00:08:19.656 --> 00:08:21.184
She said she saved it

00:08:21.208 --> 00:08:23.536
because she doesn't know
when she might get more.

00:08:24.703 --> 00:08:26.751
After this, we went to the conference room

00:08:26.775 --> 00:08:29.385
and we relaxed and we had lunch together,

00:08:29.409 --> 00:08:33.679
and the lab staff presented Callum
with a birthday gift.

00:08:34.329 --> 00:08:35.972
It was a child's lab kit.

00:08:36.569 --> 00:08:38.957
And they also offered him an internship.

00:08:38.981 --> 00:08:42.164
(Laughter)

00:08:42.188 --> 00:08:45.338
So in closing, I have two
simple messages today.

00:08:45.728 --> 00:08:49.532
One is that most of us probably
don't think about donating to research.

00:08:49.556 --> 00:08:52.666
I know I didn't.
I think I'm a normal person.

00:08:52.690 --> 00:08:53.841
But I did it.

00:08:53.865 --> 00:08:56.007
It was a good experience,
and I recommend it,

00:08:56.031 --> 00:08:57.975
and it brought my family a lot of peace.

00:08:57.999 --> 00:09:00.784
And second is if you work
with human tissue

00:09:00.808 --> 00:09:03.403
and you wonder about the donor
and about the family,

00:09:03.427 --> 00:09:04.622
write them a letter.

00:09:04.646 --> 00:09:07.462
Tell them you received it,
tell them what you're working on,

00:09:07.486 --> 00:09:09.153
and invite them to visit your lab,

00:09:09.177 --> 00:09:11.702
because that visit may be
even more gratifying for you

00:09:11.726 --> 00:09:12.957
than it is for them.

00:09:12.981 --> 00:09:14.743
And I'd also like to ask you a favor.

00:09:14.767 --> 00:09:17.726
If you're ever successful
in arranging one of these visits,

00:09:17.750 --> 00:09:19.068
please tell me about it.

00:09:20.214 --> 00:09:21.910
The other part of my family's story

00:09:21.934 --> 00:09:24.246
is that we ended up visiting
all four facilities

00:09:24.270 --> 00:09:26.332
that received Thomas's donations.

00:09:26.356 --> 00:09:29.280
And we met amazing people
doing inspiring work.

00:09:30.153 --> 00:09:35.254
The way I see it now
is that Thomas got into Harvard,

00:09:35.278 --> 00:09:37.444
Duke and Penn --

00:09:37.468 --> 00:09:40.793
(Laughter)

00:09:40.817 --> 00:09:43.185
And he has a job at Cytonet,

00:09:43.209 --> 00:09:45.994
and he has colleagues and he has coworkers

00:09:46.018 --> 00:09:47.779
who are in the top of their fields.

00:09:47.803 --> 00:09:50.374
And they need him
in order to do their job.

00:09:51.287 --> 00:09:55.938
And a life that once seemed
brief and insignificant

00:09:55.962 --> 00:10:01.644
revealed itself to be vital,
everlasting and relevant.

00:10:02.374 --> 00:10:04.921
And I only hope that my life
can be as relevant.

00:10:05.662 --> 00:10:06.813
Thank you.

00:10:06.837 --> 00:10:16.565
(Applause)
