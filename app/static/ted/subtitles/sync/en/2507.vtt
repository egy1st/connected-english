00:00:12.638 --> 00:00:14.888
So this is James Risen.

00:00:15.324 --> 00:00:18.074
You may know him as the
Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter

00:00:18.098 --> 00:00:19.790
for The New York Times.

00:00:19.814 --> 00:00:22.568
Long before anybody knew
Edward Snowden's name,

00:00:22.592 --> 00:00:25.508
Risen wrote a book in which
he famously exposed

00:00:25.532 --> 00:00:29.468
that the NSA was illegally wiretapping
the phone calls of Americans.

00:00:29.992 --> 00:00:31.762
But it's another chapter in that book

00:00:31.786 --> 00:00:33.801
that may have an even more lasting impact.

00:00:34.555 --> 00:00:39.373
In it, he describes a catastrophic
US intelligence operation

00:00:39.397 --> 00:00:42.486
in which the CIA quite literally
handed over blueprints

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.296
of a nuclear bomb to Iran.

00:00:44.812 --> 00:00:46.607
If that sounds crazy, go read it.

00:00:46.631 --> 00:00:48.122
It's an incredible story.

00:00:48.606 --> 00:00:50.670
But you know who didn't like that chapter?

00:00:51.043 --> 00:00:52.193
The US government.

00:00:52.742 --> 00:00:54.956
For nearly a decade afterwards,

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:58.233
Risen was the subject
of a US government investigation

00:00:58.257 --> 00:01:00.626
in which prosecutors demanded
that he testify

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:02.554
against one of his alleged sources.

00:01:02.979 --> 00:01:07.054
And along the way, he became the face
for the US government's recent pattern

00:01:07.078 --> 00:01:10.097
of prosecuting whistleblowers
and spying on journalists.

00:01:10.831 --> 00:01:12.499
You see, under the First Amendment,

00:01:12.523 --> 00:01:16.150
the press has the right to publish
secret information in the public interest.

00:01:16.174 --> 00:01:21.308
But it's impossible to exercise that right
if the media can't also gather that news

00:01:21.332 --> 00:01:24.588
and protect the identities
of the brave men and women

00:01:24.612 --> 00:01:25.762
who get it to them.

00:01:26.237 --> 00:01:28.269
So when the government came knocking,

00:01:28.293 --> 00:01:31.334
Risen did what many brave reporters
have done before him:

00:01:31.358 --> 00:01:32.543
he refused

00:01:32.567 --> 00:01:34.238
and said he'd rather go to jail.

00:01:34.761 --> 00:01:37.744
So from 2007 to 2015,

00:01:37.768 --> 00:01:40.562
Risen lived under the specter
of going to federal prison.

00:01:41.126 --> 00:01:45.173
That is, until just days before the trial,
when a curious thing happened.

00:01:46.062 --> 00:01:49.863
Suddenly, after years of claiming
it was vital to their case,

00:01:49.887 --> 00:01:52.577
the government dropped their demands
to Risen altogether.

00:01:53.062 --> 00:01:55.610
It turns out, in the age
of electronic surveillance,

00:01:55.634 --> 00:01:58.522
there are very few places
reporters and sources can hide.

00:01:59.109 --> 00:02:02.704
And instead of trying and failing
to have Risen testify,

00:02:02.728 --> 00:02:05.775
they could have his digital trail
testify against him instead.

00:02:06.735 --> 00:02:09.251
So completely in secret
and without his consent,

00:02:09.275 --> 00:02:11.545
prosecutors got Risen's phone records.

00:02:12.053 --> 00:02:16.569
They got his email records,
his financial and banking information,

00:02:16.593 --> 00:02:18.346
his credit reports,

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:21.140
even travel records with a list
of flights he had taken.

00:02:21.958 --> 00:02:25.743
And it was among this information that
they used to convict Jeffrey Sterling,

00:02:25.767 --> 00:02:28.886
Risen's alleged source
and CIA whistleblower.

00:02:30.185 --> 00:02:32.600
Sadly, this is only one case of many.

00:02:33.302 --> 00:02:36.909
President Obama ran on a promise
to protect whistleblowers,

00:02:36.933 --> 00:02:40.195
and instead, his Justice Department
has prosecuted more

00:02:40.219 --> 00:02:42.710
than all other administrations combined.

00:02:43.329 --> 00:02:45.433
Now, you can see how this
could be a problem,

00:02:45.457 --> 00:02:49.924
especially because the government
considers so much of what it does secret.

00:02:50.908 --> 00:02:55.408
Since 9/11, virtually every important
story about national security

00:02:55.432 --> 00:02:58.352
has been the result of a whistleblower
coming to a journalist.

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:01.718
So we risk seeing the press
unable to do their job

00:03:01.742 --> 00:03:03.941
that the First Amendment
is supposed to protect

00:03:03.965 --> 00:03:06.972
because of the government's
expanded ability to spy on everyone.

00:03:07.637 --> 00:03:10.090
But just as technology has allowed
the government

00:03:10.114 --> 00:03:12.821
to circumvent reporters' rights,

00:03:12.845 --> 00:03:15.019
the press can also use technology

00:03:15.043 --> 00:03:17.383
to protect their sources
even better than before.

00:03:17.848 --> 00:03:20.960
And they can start from the moment
they begin speaking with them,

00:03:20.984 --> 00:03:23.411
rather than on the witness stand
after the fact.

00:03:24.347 --> 00:03:26.439
Communications software now exists

00:03:26.463 --> 00:03:28.995
that wasn't available
when Risen was writing his book,

00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:33.018
and is much more surveillance-resistant
than regular emails or phone calls.

00:03:33.939 --> 00:03:38.157
For example, one such tool is SecureDrop,

00:03:38.181 --> 00:03:40.866
an open-source whistleblower
submission system

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:44.938
that was originally created by the late
Internet luminary Aaron Swartz,

00:03:44.962 --> 00:03:47.627
and is now developed
at the non-profit where I work,

00:03:47.651 --> 00:03:49.182
Freedom of the Press Foundation.

00:03:49.974 --> 00:03:51.626
Instead of sending an email,

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:53.691
you go to a news organization's website,

00:03:53.715 --> 00:03:55.715
like this one here on The Washington Post.

00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:00.103
From there, you can upload a document
or send information

00:04:00.127 --> 00:04:02.556
much like you would
on any other contact form.

00:04:02.865 --> 00:04:05.484
It'll then be encrypted
and stored on a server

00:04:05.508 --> 00:04:08.056
that only the news organization
has access to.

00:04:08.501 --> 00:04:11.874
So the government can no longer
secretly demand the information,

00:04:11.898 --> 00:04:14.002
and much of the information
they would demand

00:04:14.026 --> 00:04:15.985
wouldn't be available in the first place.

00:04:16.625 --> 00:04:19.589
SecureDrop, though, is really
only a small part of the puzzle

00:04:19.613 --> 00:04:22.560
for protecting press freedom
in the 21st century.

00:04:23.185 --> 00:04:25.558
Unfortunately, governments
all over the world

00:04:25.582 --> 00:04:28.082
are constantly developing
new spying techniques

00:04:28.106 --> 00:04:29.510
that put us all at risk.

00:04:30.193 --> 00:04:32.891
And it's up to us going forward
to make sure

00:04:32.915 --> 00:04:35.415
that it's not just
the tech-savvy whistleblowers,

00:04:35.439 --> 00:04:38.724
like Edward Snowden, who have
an avenue for exposing wrongdoing.

00:04:39.558 --> 00:04:44.305
It's just as vital that we protect the
next veteran's health care whistleblower

00:04:44.329 --> 00:04:47.637
alerting us to overcrowded hospitals,

00:04:47.661 --> 00:04:49.988
or the next environmental worker

00:04:50.012 --> 00:04:53.210
sounding the alarm
about Flint's dirty water,

00:04:53.234 --> 00:04:54.914
or a Wall Street insider

00:04:54.938 --> 00:04:57.115
warning us of the next financial crisis.

00:04:58.019 --> 00:05:02.147
After all, these tools weren't just built
to help the brave men and women

00:05:02.171 --> 00:05:03.709
who expose crimes,

00:05:03.733 --> 00:05:06.967
but are meant to protect
all of our rights under the Constitution.

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:08.761
Thank you.

00:05:08.785 --> 00:05:12.094
(Applause)
