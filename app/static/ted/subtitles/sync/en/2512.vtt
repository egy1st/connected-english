00:00:14.735 --> 00:00:16.126
What do you see?

00:00:18.038 --> 00:00:20.918
Most of you see a barbershop,

00:00:20.942 --> 00:00:23.830
but I see an opportunity:

00:00:23.854 --> 00:00:26.579
an opportunity for health,

00:00:26.603 --> 00:00:28.928
an opportunity for health equity.

00:00:30.262 --> 00:00:33.952
For black men, the barbershop
is not just a place

00:00:33.976 --> 00:00:36.698
where you get your hair cut
or your beard trimmed.

00:00:37.478 --> 00:00:39.492
No, it's much more than that.

00:00:40.615 --> 00:00:44.346
Historically, the barbershop
has been a safe haven for black men.

00:00:45.514 --> 00:00:48.720
It's a place where we go for friendship,

00:00:48.744 --> 00:00:51.085
solidarity and solace.

00:00:52.244 --> 00:00:55.837
It's a place where we go
to get away from the stress

00:00:55.861 --> 00:00:59.108
of the grind of work

00:00:59.132 --> 00:01:00.822
and sometimes home life.

00:01:02.391 --> 00:01:04.352
It's a place where we don't have to worry

00:01:04.376 --> 00:01:06.859
about how we're being perceived
by the outside world.

00:01:08.383 --> 00:01:11.692
It's a place where we don't
feel threatened,

00:01:11.716 --> 00:01:13.057
or threatening.

00:01:15.232 --> 00:01:17.462
It's a place of loyalty and trust.

00:01:18.485 --> 00:01:20.628
For that reason,

00:01:20.652 --> 00:01:24.551
it's one of the few places
where we can fearlessly be ourselves

00:01:24.575 --> 00:01:27.208
and just ... talk.

00:01:28.683 --> 00:01:31.684
The talk, the shop talk, the conversation,

00:01:31.708 --> 00:01:34.349
that is the essence
of the black barbershop.

00:01:35.328 --> 00:01:38.206
I can remember going to the barbershop
with my dad as a kid.

00:01:39.284 --> 00:01:42.712
We went to Mr. Mike's barbershop
every other Saturday.

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:47.347
And like clockwork,
the same group of men would be there

00:01:47.371 --> 00:01:49.092
every time we went,

00:01:49.116 --> 00:01:51.473
either waiting on their favorite barber

00:01:51.497 --> 00:01:54.140
or just soaking up the atmosphere.

00:01:55.471 --> 00:01:59.319
I can remember the jovial greeting
that warmly welcomed us

00:01:59.343 --> 00:02:00.764
every time we went.

00:02:01.827 --> 00:02:05.010
"Hey Rev," they would say to my dad.

00:02:05.876 --> 00:02:08.820
He's a local pastor,
and they treated him like a celebrity.

00:02:10.073 --> 00:02:12.392
"Hey young fella, how you doing?"

00:02:12.416 --> 00:02:13.868
they would say to me,

00:02:13.892 --> 00:02:15.987
making me feel just as special.

00:02:17.268 --> 00:02:21.530
I remember the range
of the conversations was immense.

00:02:22.323 --> 00:02:26.546
The men would talk about politics
and sports and music

00:02:27.355 --> 00:02:30.902
and world news, national news,

00:02:30.926 --> 00:02:32.267
neighborhood news.

00:02:33.214 --> 00:02:34.886
There was some talk about women

00:02:36.537 --> 00:02:39.164
and what it was like to be
a black man in America.

00:02:40.735 --> 00:02:43.163
But many times they also
talked about health.

00:02:45.321 --> 00:02:48.099
The conversations about health
were lengthy and deep.

00:02:49.545 --> 00:02:52.734
The men often recounted
their doctor's recommendations

00:02:52.758 --> 00:02:54.849
to cut salt in their diet

00:02:54.873 --> 00:02:57.594
or to eat less fried foods

00:02:57.618 --> 00:02:59.839
or to stop smoking

00:02:59.863 --> 00:03:01.372
or to reduce stress.

00:03:02.061 --> 00:03:05.482
They talked about the different ways
you could reduce stress,

00:03:05.506 --> 00:03:07.761
like simplifying one's love life --

00:03:08.528 --> 00:03:12.992
(Laughter)

00:03:13.016 --> 00:03:16.369
all ways to treat high blood pressure.

00:03:17.735 --> 00:03:20.971
There's a lot of talk about
high blood pressure in the barbershop.

00:03:22.411 --> 00:03:26.758
That's because almost 40 percent
of black men have it.

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:32.283
That means that almost
every single black man

00:03:32.307 --> 00:03:34.249
either has high blood pressure

00:03:34.273 --> 00:03:36.233
or knows a black man who has it.

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:41.337
Sometimes, those conversations
in the barbershop

00:03:41.361 --> 00:03:44.000
would be about what happens
when high blood pressure

00:03:44.024 --> 00:03:45.650
is not adequately addressed.

00:03:47.468 --> 00:03:51.238
"Say, did you hear about Jimmy?
He had a stroke."

00:03:53.762 --> 00:03:58.017
"Did you hear about Eddie?
He died last week.

00:03:58.041 --> 00:03:59.729
Massive heart attack.

00:03:59.753 --> 00:04:00.945
He was 50."

00:04:02.734 --> 00:04:06.653
More black men die from high blood
pressure than from anything else,

00:04:06.677 --> 00:04:11.572
even though decades of medical wisdom
and science have demonstrated

00:04:11.596 --> 00:04:14.740
that death from high blood pressure
can be prevented

00:04:14.764 --> 00:04:18.119
with timely diagnosis
and appropriate treatment.

00:04:19.282 --> 00:04:23.135
So why is high blood pressure
so differentially deadly for black men?

00:04:24.607 --> 00:04:28.517
Because too often, high blood pressure
is either untreated

00:04:28.541 --> 00:04:31.182
or under-treated in black men,

00:04:31.206 --> 00:04:35.344
in part because of our lower engagement
with the primary healthcare system.

00:04:36.708 --> 00:04:40.489
Black men, in particular
those with high blood pressure,

00:04:40.513 --> 00:04:42.617
are less likely to have
a primary care doctor

00:04:42.641 --> 00:04:43.791
than other groups.

00:04:44.388 --> 00:04:45.560
But why?

00:04:46.531 --> 00:04:49.631
Some of our earliest research
on black men's health

00:04:49.655 --> 00:04:54.269
revealed that for many, the doctor's
office is associated with fear,

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:57.165
mistrust,

00:04:57.189 --> 00:04:59.210
disrespect,

00:04:59.234 --> 00:05:01.416
and unnecessary unpleasantness.

00:05:03.224 --> 00:05:07.477
The doctor's office is only a place
that you go when you don't feel well.

00:05:08.052 --> 00:05:11.342
And when you do go,
you might wait for hours

00:05:11.366 --> 00:05:13.715
only to get the run-around

00:05:13.739 --> 00:05:18.310
and to be evaluated by
a stoic figure in a white coat

00:05:18.334 --> 00:05:20.961
who only has 10 minutes to give you

00:05:20.985 --> 00:05:23.850
and who doesn't value the talk.

00:05:25.365 --> 00:05:28.833
So it's no wonder that some men
don't want to be bothered

00:05:28.857 --> 00:05:32.153
and skip going to the doctor altogether,

00:05:32.177 --> 00:05:34.309
especially if they feel fine.

00:05:35.552 --> 00:05:37.491
But herein lies the problem.

00:05:38.478 --> 00:05:40.599
You can feel just fine

00:05:40.623 --> 00:05:44.446
while high blood pressure ravages
your most vital organs.

00:05:46.984 --> 00:05:49.651
This is Denny Moe,

00:05:49.675 --> 00:05:53.333
owner of Denny Moe's
Superstar Barbershop in Harlem.

00:05:53.888 --> 00:05:57.587
I've been lucky enough to have Denny
as my barber for the last eight years.

00:05:58.690 --> 00:06:00.371
He said to me once,

00:06:00.395 --> 00:06:02.444
"Hey Doc, you know,

00:06:02.468 --> 00:06:06.864
lots of black men trust their barbers
more than they trust their doctors."

00:06:08.029 --> 00:06:10.087
This was stunning to me,

00:06:10.111 --> 00:06:11.276
at first,

00:06:11.919 --> 00:06:13.839
but not so much when you think about it.

00:06:15.021 --> 00:06:17.737
Black men have been with their
current barbers

00:06:17.761 --> 00:06:19.762
on average as long
as I've been with Denny,

00:06:19.786 --> 00:06:21.014
about eight years.

00:06:21.824 --> 00:06:25.975
And black men see their barbers
about every two weeks.

00:06:26.991 --> 00:06:31.594
Not only do you trust your barber
with your look and with your style,

00:06:31.618 --> 00:06:35.524
but you also trust him with your secrets
and sometimes your life.

00:06:37.341 --> 00:06:40.969
Denny, like many barbers,
is more than just an artist,

00:06:40.993 --> 00:06:43.199
a businessman and confidant.

00:06:44.056 --> 00:06:49.024
He's a leader and a passionate advocate
for the well-being of his community.

00:06:51.119 --> 00:06:54.097
The very first time I walked
into Denny Moe's shop,

00:06:54.121 --> 00:06:55.603
he wasn't just cutting hair.

00:06:56.595 --> 00:07:00.348
He was also orchestrating
a voter registration drive

00:07:00.372 --> 00:07:04.269
to give a voice to his customers
and his community.

00:07:06.150 --> 00:07:08.261
With this kind of activism,

00:07:09.356 --> 00:07:13.593
and community investment
that typifies the black barbershop,

00:07:13.617 --> 00:07:17.165
of course the barbershop
is a perfect place

00:07:17.189 --> 00:07:21.102
to talk about high blood pressure and
other health concerns in the community.

00:07:22.094 --> 00:07:26.244
First, the barbershop is not
a medical setting,

00:07:26.268 --> 00:07:29.513
and so it doesn't have
all the negative psychological baggage

00:07:29.537 --> 00:07:30.927
that comes along with that.

00:07:31.578 --> 00:07:33.633
When you're in a barbershop,

00:07:33.657 --> 00:07:37.086
you're in your territory,
and you're among friends

00:07:37.110 --> 00:07:39.372
who share your history,

00:07:39.396 --> 00:07:42.809
your struggle and your health risks.

00:07:43.458 --> 00:07:47.519
Second, because the barbershop
is a place of connection,

00:07:47.543 --> 00:07:50.045
loyalty and trust,

00:07:50.069 --> 00:07:53.578
it's a place where you're more open
to have a conversation about health

00:07:53.602 --> 00:07:55.625
and especially about high blood pressure.

00:07:56.315 --> 00:07:57.785
After all,

00:07:57.809 --> 00:08:02.023
conversations about high blood pressure
have all the elements of great shop talk:

00:08:03.167 --> 00:08:05.768
stress and high blood pressure,

00:08:05.792 --> 00:08:08.322
food and high blood pressure,

00:08:08.346 --> 00:08:10.983
relationships and high blood pressure,

00:08:11.007 --> 00:08:14.942
and yes, what it's like
to be a black man in America

00:08:14.966 --> 00:08:16.196
and high blood pressure.

00:08:17.996 --> 00:08:21.068
But you can do more than just talk
about high blood pressure

00:08:21.092 --> 00:08:22.331
in the barbershop.

00:08:22.825 --> 00:08:24.934
You can concretely take action.

00:08:26.065 --> 00:08:30.823
Here we have an opportunity to partner
with the Denny Moe's of the world

00:08:30.847 --> 00:08:35.125
and empower communities
to address the health inequities

00:08:35.149 --> 00:08:36.454
that uniquely affect it.

00:08:37.514 --> 00:08:40.974
When high blood pressure screening
expanded from clinics and hospitals

00:08:40.998 --> 00:08:44.125
to communities in the 1960s and '70s,

00:08:44.149 --> 00:08:47.506
black physicians like
Dr. Eli Saunders in Baltimore

00:08:47.530 --> 00:08:50.015
and Dr. Keith Ferdinand in New Orleans

00:08:50.039 --> 00:08:54.114
were at the forefront of bringing
health promotion to community hubs

00:08:54.138 --> 00:08:55.626
in urban black neighborhoods.

00:08:56.559 --> 00:09:00.699
These pioneers paved the way
for my professional journey

00:09:00.723 --> 00:09:02.706
with barbershops and health,

00:09:02.730 --> 00:09:06.015
which began in Chicago in medical school.

00:09:07.522 --> 00:09:11.004
The very first research project
that I worked on as a medical student

00:09:11.028 --> 00:09:13.528
was to help design
healthcare interventions

00:09:13.552 --> 00:09:15.825
that would appeal to black men.

00:09:16.994 --> 00:09:19.877
We conducted about a dozen focus groups

00:09:19.901 --> 00:09:23.176
with a broad cross-section of black men,

00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:25.314
and we learned that for them,

00:09:25.338 --> 00:09:29.721
being healthy was as much about
being perceived as healthy

00:09:29.745 --> 00:09:31.993
as it was about feeling healthy,

00:09:32.017 --> 00:09:36.270
and that feeling good
went hand in hand with looking good.

00:09:38.159 --> 00:09:42.008
This work led to the development
of Project Brotherhood,

00:09:42.032 --> 00:09:44.937
a community clinic founded
by Dr. Eric Whitaker

00:09:44.961 --> 00:09:47.754
that provided tailored
healthcare to black men.

00:09:48.865 --> 00:09:50.873
Part of this tailored care

00:09:50.897 --> 00:09:53.698
involved having a barber on the premises

00:09:53.722 --> 00:09:57.325
to reward the men who came
for needed healthcare

00:09:57.349 --> 00:09:59.314
with a free haircut,

00:09:59.338 --> 00:10:03.284
to let the men know that we, too,
valued how they looked

00:10:03.308 --> 00:10:05.178
as well as how they felt,

00:10:05.202 --> 00:10:09.384
and that what was important to them
was also important to us.

00:10:10.470 --> 00:10:13.698
But while there's only one
Project Brotherhood,

00:10:13.722 --> 00:10:17.043
there are thousands of black barbershops

00:10:17.067 --> 00:10:21.543
where the intersection of health
and haircuts can be cultivated.

00:10:22.932 --> 00:10:26.304
The next stop on my journey
was Dallas, Texas,

00:10:26.328 --> 00:10:29.345
where we learned that barbers
were not only willing

00:10:29.369 --> 00:10:33.408
but fully able to roll up
their sleeves and participate

00:10:33.432 --> 00:10:38.956
in delivering needed health services
to improve the health of their customers

00:10:38.980 --> 00:10:40.234
and their community.

00:10:41.066 --> 00:10:44.539
We teamed up with an amazing
cadre of black barbers

00:10:44.563 --> 00:10:46.707
and taught them how
to measure blood pressure

00:10:46.731 --> 00:10:48.512
and how to counsel their customers

00:10:48.536 --> 00:10:50.363
and refer them to doctors

00:10:50.387 --> 00:10:52.231
to help manage high blood pressure.

00:10:53.127 --> 00:10:55.389
The barbers were not only willing to do it

00:10:55.413 --> 00:10:56.881
but they were damn good at it.

00:10:57.944 --> 00:10:59.898
Over a three-year period,

00:10:59.922 --> 00:11:02.866
the barbers measured
thousands of blood pressures

00:11:02.890 --> 00:11:07.691
resulting in hundreds of black men
being referred to doctors

00:11:07.715 --> 00:11:10.795
for medical care
of their high blood pressure.

00:11:11.382 --> 00:11:14.294
These barber-doctor partnerships

00:11:14.318 --> 00:11:18.802
resulted in a 20 percent increase
in the number of men

00:11:18.826 --> 00:11:21.619
who were able to achieve
target blood pressure levels

00:11:21.643 --> 00:11:24.103
and a three-point drop, on average,

00:11:24.127 --> 00:11:26.127
in the blood pressure of each participant.

00:11:26.571 --> 00:11:29.539
If we were to extrapolate
that three point drop

00:11:29.563 --> 00:11:32.968
to every single black man
with high blood pressure in America,

00:11:32.992 --> 00:11:39.239
we would prevent 800 heart attacks,
500 strokes and 900 deaths

00:11:39.263 --> 00:11:41.121
from high blood pressure

00:11:41.145 --> 00:11:43.047
in just one year.

00:11:44.952 --> 00:11:49.174
And our experience with barbershops
has been no different in New York City,

00:11:49.198 --> 00:11:51.047
where my journey has currently led me.

00:11:51.872 --> 00:11:55.816
With an incredible team
of diverse research assistants,

00:11:55.840 --> 00:11:58.966
community health workers and volunteers,

00:11:58.990 --> 00:12:02.391
we've been able to partner
with over 200 barbershops

00:12:02.415 --> 00:12:04.899
and other trusted community venues

00:12:04.923 --> 00:12:08.184
to reach over 7,000 older black men.

00:12:08.714 --> 00:12:11.627
And we've offered high blood pressure
screening and counseling

00:12:11.651 --> 00:12:13.087
to each and every one of them.

00:12:13.960 --> 00:12:15.645
Thanks to Denny Moe

00:12:15.669 --> 00:12:19.272
and the myriad other barbers
and community leaders

00:12:19.296 --> 00:12:24.240
who shared the vision of opportunity
and empowerment

00:12:24.264 --> 00:12:26.970
to make a difference in their communities,

00:12:26.994 --> 00:12:29.749
we've been able to not only
lower blood pressure

00:12:29.773 --> 00:12:31.233
in our participants,

00:12:31.257 --> 00:12:34.969
but we've also been able to impact
other health indicators.

00:12:38.450 --> 00:12:39.772
So what do you see?

00:12:41.682 --> 00:12:43.352
What is your barbershop?

00:12:45.844 --> 00:12:48.693
Where is that place for you

00:12:49.724 --> 00:12:52.653
where people who are affected
by a unique problem

00:12:53.273 --> 00:12:55.058
can meet a unique solution?

00:12:57.717 --> 00:13:01.832
When you find that place,
see the opportunity.

00:13:02.753 --> 00:13:03.904
Thank you.

00:13:03.928 --> 00:13:07.372
(Applause)
