00:00:13.347 --> 00:00:16.342
War has been a part of my life
since I can remember.

00:00:16.961 --> 00:00:21.105
I was born in Afghanistan,
just six months after the Soviets invaded,

00:00:21.676 --> 00:00:24.957
and even though I was too young
to understand what was happening,

00:00:24.981 --> 00:00:28.302
I had a deep sense of the suffering
and the fear around me.

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:34.491
Those early experiences had a major impact
on how I now think about war and conflict.

00:00:35.199 --> 00:00:38.637
I learned that when people
have a fundamental issue at stake,

00:00:38.661 --> 00:00:39.913
for most of them,

00:00:39.937 --> 00:00:41.569
giving in is not an option.

00:00:42.121 --> 00:00:43.733
For these types conflicts --

00:00:43.757 --> 00:00:45.542
when people's rights are violated,

00:00:45.566 --> 00:00:47.336
when their countries are occupied,

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:49.578
when they're oppressed and humiliated --

00:00:49.602 --> 00:00:52.760
they need a powerful way
to resist and to fight back.

00:00:53.458 --> 00:00:57.721
Which means that no matter how destructive
and terrible violence is,

00:00:57.745 --> 00:01:00.169
if people see it as their only choice,

00:01:00.193 --> 00:01:01.650
they will use it.

00:01:02.224 --> 00:01:05.800
Most of us are concerned
with the level of violence in the world.

00:01:06.195 --> 00:01:07.649
But we're not going to end war

00:01:07.673 --> 00:01:10.381
by telling people
that violence is morally wrong.

00:01:11.033 --> 00:01:13.432
Instead, we must offer them a tool

00:01:13.456 --> 00:01:16.795
that's at least as powerful
and as effective as violence.

00:01:17.724 --> 00:01:19.210
This is the work I do.

00:01:19.867 --> 00:01:21.406
For the past 13 years,

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:22.715
I've been teaching people

00:01:22.739 --> 00:01:25.847
in some of the most difficult
situations around the world

00:01:25.871 --> 00:01:29.238
how they can use nonviolent
struggle to conduct conflict.

00:01:30.263 --> 00:01:34.953
Most people associate this type of action
with Gandhi and Martin Luther King.

00:01:35.739 --> 00:01:39.452
But people have been using
nonviolent action for thousands of years.

00:01:39.981 --> 00:01:44.313
In fact, most of the rights
that we have today in this country --

00:01:44.337 --> 00:01:45.488
as women,

00:01:45.512 --> 00:01:46.663
as minorities,

00:01:46.687 --> 00:01:48.035
as workers,

00:01:48.059 --> 00:01:50.625
as people of different sexual orientations

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:53.107
and citizens concerned
with the environment --

00:01:53.131 --> 00:01:54.988
these rights weren't handed to us.

00:01:55.376 --> 00:01:57.536
They were won by people
who fought for them

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:59.382
and who sacrificed for them.

00:01:59.406 --> 00:02:01.926
But because we haven't learned
from this history,

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:05.991
nonviolent struggle as a technique
is widely misunderstood.

00:02:06.638 --> 00:02:09.760
I met recently with a group
of Ethiopian activists,

00:02:09.784 --> 00:02:12.934
and they told me something
that I hear a lot.

00:02:12.958 --> 00:02:15.284
They said they'd already
tried nonviolent action,

00:02:15.308 --> 00:02:16.726
and it hadn't worked.

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:19.086
Years ago they held a protest.

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:22.818
The government arrested everyone,
and that was the end of that.

00:02:23.452 --> 00:02:27.412
The idea that nonviolent struggle
is equivalent to street protests

00:02:27.436 --> 00:02:28.834
is a real problem.

00:02:29.354 --> 00:02:33.754
Because although protests can be a great
way to show that people want change,

00:02:33.778 --> 00:02:36.648
on their own, they don't
actually create change --

00:02:36.672 --> 00:02:38.640
at least change that is fundamental.

00:02:38.664 --> 00:02:39.852
(Laughter)

00:02:39.876 --> 00:02:42.985
Powerful opponents are not going to give
people what they want

00:02:43.009 --> 00:02:44.941
just because they asked nicely ...

00:02:45.669 --> 00:02:47.546
or even not so nicely.

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:48.703
(Laughter)

00:02:48.727 --> 00:02:51.771
Nonviolent struggle works
by destroying an opponent,

00:02:52.168 --> 00:02:53.480
not physically,

00:02:53.504 --> 00:02:57.914
but by identifying the institutions
that an opponent needs to survive,

00:02:57.938 --> 00:03:00.120
and then denying them
those sources of power.

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:03.384
Nonviolent activists
can neutralize the military

00:03:03.408 --> 00:03:05.632
by causing soldiers to defect.

00:03:05.656 --> 00:03:08.931
They can disrupt the economy
through strikes and boycotts.

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:11.642
And they can challenge
government propaganda

00:03:11.666 --> 00:03:13.532
by creating alternative media.

00:03:13.979 --> 00:03:16.823
There are a variety of methods
that can be used to do this.

00:03:17.534 --> 00:03:20.326
My colleague and mentor, Gene Sharp,

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:24.977
has identified 198 methods
of nonviolent action.

00:03:26.336 --> 00:03:28.101
And protest is only one.

00:03:28.526 --> 00:03:30.523
Let me give you a recent example.

00:03:31.035 --> 00:03:32.504
Until a few months ago,

00:03:32.528 --> 00:03:35.745
Guatemala was ruled
by corrupt former military officials

00:03:35.769 --> 00:03:37.580
with ties to organized crime.

00:03:38.221 --> 00:03:40.014
People were generally aware of this,

00:03:40.038 --> 00:03:43.388
but most of them felt powerless
to do anything about it --

00:03:44.551 --> 00:03:48.632
until one group of citizens,
just 12 regular people,

00:03:48.656 --> 00:03:51.398
put out a call on Facebook
to their friends

00:03:51.422 --> 00:03:54.661
to meet in the central plaza,
holding signs with a message:

00:03:55.196 --> 00:03:56.581
"Renuncia YA" --

00:03:57.174 --> 00:03:58.590
resign already.

00:03:59.349 --> 00:04:00.758
To their surprise,

00:04:00.782 --> 00:04:02.542
30,000 people showed up.

00:04:03.195 --> 00:04:06.632
They stayed there for months
as protests spread throughout the country.

00:04:07.082 --> 00:04:08.238
At one point,

00:04:08.262 --> 00:04:12.450
the organizers delivered hundreds of eggs
to various government buildings

00:04:12.474 --> 00:04:13.641
with a message:

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:15.996
"If you don't have the huevos" --

00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:17.226
the balls --

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:20.304
"to stop corrupt candidates
from running for office,

00:04:20.328 --> 00:04:21.786
you can borrow ours."

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:23.469
(Laughter)

00:04:23.493 --> 00:04:26.848
(Applause)

00:04:28.619 --> 00:04:30.138
President Molina responded

00:04:30.162 --> 00:04:32.298
by vowing that he would never step down.

00:04:32.824 --> 00:04:36.425
And the activists realized
that they couldn't just keep protesting

00:04:36.449 --> 00:04:38.463
and ask the president to resign.

00:04:38.487 --> 00:04:40.483
They needed to leave him no choice.

00:04:40.943 --> 00:04:42.874
So they organized a general strike,

00:04:42.898 --> 00:04:45.545
in which people throughout
the country refused to work.

00:04:45.569 --> 00:04:46.971
In Guatemala City alone,

00:04:46.995 --> 00:04:49.944
over 400 businesses
and schools shut their doors.

00:04:50.517 --> 00:04:51.698
Meanwhile,

00:04:51.722 --> 00:04:54.351
farmers throughout the country
blocked major roads.

00:04:54.375 --> 00:04:55.853
Within five days,

00:04:55.877 --> 00:04:57.054
the president,

00:04:57.078 --> 00:04:59.801
along with dozens of other
government officials,

00:04:59.825 --> 00:05:01.294
resigned already.

00:05:01.318 --> 00:05:05.601
(Applause)

00:05:05.625 --> 00:05:07.228
I've been greatly inspired

00:05:07.252 --> 00:05:11.155
by the creativity and bravery
of people using nonviolent action

00:05:11.179 --> 00:05:13.402
in nearly every country in the world.

00:05:13.868 --> 00:05:15.019
For example,

00:05:15.043 --> 00:05:17.600
recently a group of activists in Uganda

00:05:17.624 --> 00:05:19.757
released a crate of pigs in the streets.

00:05:20.246 --> 00:05:23.684
You can see here that the police
are confused about what to do with them.

00:05:23.708 --> 00:05:24.744
(Laughter)

00:05:24.768 --> 00:05:27.384
The pigs were painted
the color of the ruling party.

00:05:27.767 --> 00:05:30.045
One pig was even wearing a hat,

00:05:30.069 --> 00:05:31.949
a hat that people recognized.

00:05:32.471 --> 00:05:33.534
(Laughter)

00:05:34.414 --> 00:05:37.783
Activists around the world
are getting better at grabbing headlines,

00:05:37.807 --> 00:05:40.470
but these isolated actions do very little

00:05:40.494 --> 00:05:42.677
if they're not part of a larger strategy.

00:05:43.064 --> 00:05:45.303
A general wouldn't march
his troops into battle

00:05:45.327 --> 00:05:47.458
unless he had a plan to win the war.

00:05:47.482 --> 00:05:50.593
Yet this is how most of the world's
nonviolent movements operate.

00:05:51.046 --> 00:05:55.366
Nonviolent struggle is just as complex
as military warfare,

00:05:55.390 --> 00:05:56.588
if not more.

00:05:56.612 --> 00:06:00.807
Its participants must be well-trained
and have clear objectives,

00:06:00.831 --> 00:06:04.663
and its leaders must have a strategy
of how to achieve those objectives.

00:06:05.392 --> 00:06:08.658
The technique of war has been developed
over thousands of years

00:06:08.682 --> 00:06:10.229
with massive resources

00:06:10.253 --> 00:06:13.499
and some of our best minds
dedicated to understanding

00:06:13.523 --> 00:06:15.248
and improving how it works.

00:06:15.758 --> 00:06:20.340
Meanwhile, nonviolent struggle
is rarely systematically studied,

00:06:20.364 --> 00:06:22.374
and even though the number is growing,

00:06:22.398 --> 00:06:26.183
there are still only a few dozen people
in the world who are teaching it.

00:06:26.999 --> 00:06:28.292
This is dangerous,

00:06:28.316 --> 00:06:32.484
because we now know that our old
approaches of dealing with conflict

00:06:32.508 --> 00:06:35.926
are not adequate for the new
challenges that we're facing.

00:06:35.950 --> 00:06:38.033
The US government recently admitted

00:06:38.057 --> 00:06:40.970
that it's in a stalemate
in its war against ISIS.

00:06:41.468 --> 00:06:43.212
But what most people don't know

00:06:43.236 --> 00:06:46.750
is that people have stood up to ISIS
using nonviolent action.

00:06:47.270 --> 00:06:51.080
When ISIS captured Mosul in June 2014,

00:06:51.104 --> 00:06:54.835
they announced that they were putting
in place a new public school curriculum,

00:06:54.859 --> 00:06:56.989
based on their own extremist ideology.

00:06:57.706 --> 00:06:59.246
But on the first day of school,

00:06:59.822 --> 00:07:01.508
not a single child showed up.

00:07:02.372 --> 00:07:05.194
Parents simply refused to send them.

00:07:05.218 --> 00:07:08.410
They told journalists they would rather
homeschool their children

00:07:08.434 --> 00:07:09.990
than to have them brainwashed.

00:07:10.839 --> 00:07:13.848
This is an example
of just one act of defiance

00:07:13.872 --> 00:07:15.227
in just one city.

00:07:15.809 --> 00:07:17.254
But what if it was coordinated

00:07:17.278 --> 00:07:19.900
with the dozens of other acts
of nonviolent resistance

00:07:19.924 --> 00:07:21.979
that have taken place against ISIS?

00:07:22.003 --> 00:07:25.438
What if the parents' boycott
was part of a larger strategy

00:07:25.462 --> 00:07:29.688
to identify and cut off the resources
that ISIS needs to function;

00:07:30.307 --> 00:07:32.803
the skilled labor needed to produce food;

00:07:32.827 --> 00:07:36.416
the engineers needed
to extract and refine oil;

00:07:36.440 --> 00:07:39.033
the media infrastructure
and communications networks

00:07:39.057 --> 00:07:41.030
and transportation systems,

00:07:41.054 --> 00:07:43.558
and the local businesses
that ISIS relies on?

00:07:44.061 --> 00:07:47.182
It may be difficult
to imagine defeating ISIS

00:07:47.206 --> 00:07:49.117
with action that is nonviolent.

00:07:49.661 --> 00:07:52.769
But it's time we challenge
the way we think about conflict

00:07:52.793 --> 00:07:55.208
and the choices we have in facing it.

00:07:56.344 --> 00:07:58.615
Here's an idea worth spreading:

00:07:58.639 --> 00:08:01.794
let's learn more about where
nonviolent action has worked

00:08:01.818 --> 00:08:04.335
and how we can make it more powerful,

00:08:04.359 --> 00:08:07.403
just like we do with other
systems and technologies

00:08:07.427 --> 00:08:10.986
that are constantly being refined
to better meet human needs.

00:08:11.596 --> 00:08:15.055
It may be that we can improve
nonviolent action

00:08:15.079 --> 00:08:18.330
to a point where it is increasingly
used in place of war.

00:08:18.988 --> 00:08:23.063
Violence as a tool of conflict
could then be abandoned

00:08:23.087 --> 00:08:25.494
in the same way that bows and arrows were,

00:08:25.518 --> 00:08:28.862
because we have replaced them
with weapons that are more effective.

00:08:29.577 --> 00:08:34.456
With human innovation, we can make
nonviolent struggle more powerful

00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:37.104
than the newest and latest
technologies of war.

00:08:38.160 --> 00:08:42.623
The greatest hope for humanity
lies not in condemning violence

00:08:42.647 --> 00:08:45.010
but in making violence obsolete.

00:08:46.515 --> 00:08:47.666
Thank you.

00:08:47.690 --> 00:08:56.085
(Applause)
