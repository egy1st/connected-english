00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:15.416
What do you do if you had
to figure out the information

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:17.841
behind 11.5 million documents,

00:00:17.865 --> 00:00:19.761
verify it and make sense of it?

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:21.452
That was a challenge

00:00:21.476 --> 00:00:24.333
that a group of journalists
had to face late last year.

00:00:24.812 --> 00:00:28.248
An anonymous person
calling himself John Doe

00:00:28.272 --> 00:00:31.324
had somehow managed to copy
nearly 40 years of records

00:00:31.348 --> 00:00:34.848
of the Panamanian law firm
Mossack Fonseca.

00:00:35.467 --> 00:00:38.157
This is one of many firms around the world

00:00:38.181 --> 00:00:41.712
that specialize in setting up accounts
in offshore tax havens

00:00:41.736 --> 00:00:43.736
like the British Virgin Islands,

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:47.432
for rich and powerful people
who like to keep secrets.

00:00:48.345 --> 00:00:51.883
John Doe had managed to copy
every spreadsheet from this firm,

00:00:51.907 --> 00:00:53.501
every client file,

00:00:53.525 --> 00:00:55.224
every email,

00:00:55.248 --> 00:00:58.027
from 1977 to the present day.

00:00:59.062 --> 00:01:01.377
It represented the biggest cache

00:01:01.401 --> 00:01:04.187
of inside information
into the tax haven system

00:01:04.211 --> 00:01:05.739
that anyone had ever seen.

00:01:06.242 --> 00:01:11.090
But it also presented a gigantic challenge
to investigative journalism.

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:15.952
Think about it:
11.5 million documents,

00:01:16.485 --> 00:01:20.575
containing the secrets of people
from more than 200 different countries.

00:01:20.599 --> 00:01:23.076
Where do you start
with such a vast resource?

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.179
Where do you even begin to tell a story

00:01:25.203 --> 00:01:27.794
that can trail off
into every corner of the globe,

00:01:28.517 --> 00:01:31.562
and that can affect almost
any person in any language,

00:01:31.586 --> 00:01:34.013
sometimes in ways
they don't even know yet.

00:01:34.663 --> 00:01:37.165
John Doe had given the information
to two journalists

00:01:37.189 --> 00:01:39.804
at the German newspaper
Süddeutsche Zeitung.

00:01:40.712 --> 00:01:43.946
He said he was motivated
by -- and I quote --

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:47.550
"The scale of the injustice
that the documents would reveal."

00:01:48.551 --> 00:01:50.534
But one user alone can never make sense

00:01:50.558 --> 00:01:52.488
of such a vast amount of information.

00:01:52.512 --> 00:01:54.374
So the Süddeutsche Zeitung reached out

00:01:54.398 --> 00:01:57.142
to my organization in Washington, DC,

00:01:57.166 --> 00:02:00.537
The International Consortium
of Investigative Journalists.

00:02:02.076 --> 00:02:04.650
We decided to do something
that was the very opposite

00:02:04.674 --> 00:02:07.415
of everything we'd been taught
to do as journalists:

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:08.594
share.

00:02:08.618 --> 00:02:09.999
(Laughter)

00:02:10.474 --> 00:02:14.128
By nature, investigative
reporters are lone wolves.

00:02:14.152 --> 00:02:15.981
We fiercely guard our secrets,

00:02:16.005 --> 00:02:17.539
at times even from our editors,

00:02:17.563 --> 00:02:20.423
because we know that the moment
we tell them what we have,

00:02:20.447 --> 00:02:22.327
they'll want that story right away.

00:02:22.841 --> 00:02:24.139
And to be frank,

00:02:24.757 --> 00:02:26.179
when you get a good story,

00:02:26.203 --> 00:02:28.607
you like to keep the glory to yourself.

00:02:29.883 --> 00:02:32.492
But there's no doubt
that we live in a shrinking world,

00:02:32.516 --> 00:02:35.685
and that the media has largely
been slow to wake up to this.

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:38.745
The issues we report on
are more and more transnational.

00:02:39.285 --> 00:02:42.013
Giant corporations operate
on a global level.

00:02:42.591 --> 00:02:45.884
Environmental and health
crises are global.

00:02:45.908 --> 00:02:48.877
So, too, are financial flows
and financial crises.

00:02:49.638 --> 00:02:52.642
So it seems staggering
that journalism has been so late

00:02:52.666 --> 00:02:55.218
to cover stories in a truly global way.

00:02:55.933 --> 00:02:58.937
And it also seems staggering
that journalism has been so slow

00:02:58.961 --> 00:03:02.370
to wake up to the possibilities
that technology brings,

00:03:02.394 --> 00:03:04.398
rather than being frightened of it.

00:03:05.816 --> 00:03:08.765
The reason journalists
are scared of technology is this:

00:03:09.627 --> 00:03:13.187
the profession's largest institutions
are going through tough times

00:03:13.211 --> 00:03:16.449
because of the changing way
that people are consuming news.

00:03:17.108 --> 00:03:21.600
The advertising business models
that have sustained reporting are broken.

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:24.698
And this has plunged
journalism into crisis,

00:03:24.722 --> 00:03:28.817
forcing those institutions
to reexamine how they function.

00:03:30.408 --> 00:03:32.061
But where there is crisis,

00:03:32.085 --> 00:03:33.608
there is also opportunity.

00:03:34.163 --> 00:03:35.617
The first challenge presented

00:03:35.641 --> 00:03:38.489
by what would eventually become
known as the Panama Papers

00:03:38.513 --> 00:03:41.062
was to make the documents
searchable and readable.

00:03:41.086 --> 00:03:43.713
There were nearly five million emails,

00:03:43.737 --> 00:03:47.050
two million PDFs that needed
to be scanned and indexed,

00:03:47.074 --> 00:03:49.886
and millions more files
and other kinds of documents.

00:03:50.312 --> 00:03:53.149
They all needed to be housed
in a safe and secure location

00:03:53.173 --> 00:03:54.330
in the cloud.

00:03:55.111 --> 00:03:58.582
We next invited reporters
to have a look at the documents.

00:03:58.606 --> 00:04:02.466
In all, reporters from more
than 100 media organizations

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:04.133
in 76 countries --

00:04:04.583 --> 00:04:06.628
from the BBC in Britain

00:04:06.652 --> 00:04:08.868
to Le Monde newspaper in France

00:04:08.892 --> 00:04:11.280
to the Asahi Shimbun in Japan.

00:04:12.623 --> 00:04:16.373
"Native eyes on native names,"
we called it, the idea being,

00:04:16.397 --> 00:04:19.756
who best to tell you
who was important to Nigeria

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:21.350
than a Nigerian journalist?

00:04:21.773 --> 00:04:23.898
Who best in Canada than a Canadian?

00:04:24.397 --> 00:04:27.453
There were only two rules
for everyone who was invited:

00:04:27.477 --> 00:04:31.659
we all agreed to share everything
that we found with everybody else,

00:04:32.485 --> 00:04:35.119
and we all agreed to publish
together on the same day.

00:04:35.919 --> 00:04:37.954
We chose our media partners based on trust

00:04:37.978 --> 00:04:41.196
that had been built up through
previous smaller collaborations

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:44.227
and also from leads
that jumped out from the documents.

00:04:44.775 --> 00:04:46.010
Over the next few months,

00:04:46.034 --> 00:04:48.692
my small nonprofit organization
of less than 20 people

00:04:48.716 --> 00:04:53.149
was joined by more than 350 other
reporters from 25 language groups.

00:04:54.185 --> 00:04:56.107
The biggest information leak in history

00:04:56.131 --> 00:04:59.527
had now spawned the biggest
journalism collaboration in history:

00:05:00.241 --> 00:05:06.329
376 sets of native eyes doing
what journalists normally never do,

00:05:06.353 --> 00:05:07.964
working shoulder to shoulder,

00:05:07.988 --> 00:05:09.614
sharing information,

00:05:09.638 --> 00:05:11.055
but telling no one.

00:05:12.252 --> 00:05:13.851
For it became clear at this point

00:05:13.875 --> 00:05:16.232
that in order to make
the biggest kind of noise,

00:05:16.256 --> 00:05:19.441
we first needed
the biggest kind of silence.

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:23.370
To manage the project
over the many months it would take,

00:05:23.394 --> 00:05:25.211
we built a secure virtual newsroom.

00:05:25.235 --> 00:05:27.710
We used encrypted communication systems,

00:05:28.307 --> 00:05:30.997
and we built a specially
designed search engine.

00:05:31.021 --> 00:05:32.648
Inside the virtual newsroom,

00:05:32.672 --> 00:05:34.759
the reporters could gather
around the themes

00:05:34.783 --> 00:05:36.764
that were emerging from the documents.

00:05:36.788 --> 00:05:42.094
Those interested in blood diamonds
or exotic art, for instance,

00:05:42.118 --> 00:05:45.308
could share information about how
the offshore world was being used

00:05:45.332 --> 00:05:47.539
to hide the trade in both
of those commodities.

00:05:47.563 --> 00:05:50.003
Those interested in sport
could share information

00:05:50.027 --> 00:05:53.292
about how famous sports stars
were putting their image rights

00:05:53.316 --> 00:05:54.840
into offshore companies,

00:05:54.864 --> 00:05:57.127
thereby likely avoiding taxes

00:05:57.151 --> 00:05:59.627
in the countries
where they plied their trade.

00:06:00.247 --> 00:06:02.035
But perhaps most exciting of all

00:06:02.059 --> 00:06:05.536
were the number of world leaders
and elect politicians

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:07.588
that were emerging from the documents --

00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:11.699
figures like Petro Poroshenko in Ukraine,

00:06:12.974 --> 00:06:16.500
close associates
of Vladimir Putin in Russia

00:06:18.002 --> 00:06:21.159
and the British Prime Minister,
David Cameron, who is linked

00:06:21.183 --> 00:06:23.500
through his late father, Ian Cameron.

00:06:24.679 --> 00:06:27.910
Buried in the documents
were secret offshore entities,

00:06:27.934 --> 00:06:29.722
such as Wintris Inc.,

00:06:30.577 --> 00:06:32.453
a company in the British Virgin Islands

00:06:32.477 --> 00:06:36.119
that had actually belonged
to the sitting Icelandic prime minister.

00:06:36.585 --> 00:06:38.996
I like to refer to Johannes Kristjansson,

00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:41.937
the Icelandic reporter
we invited to join the project,

00:06:41.961 --> 00:06:43.833
as the loneliest man in the world.

00:06:44.381 --> 00:06:46.670
For nine months, he refused paid work

00:06:46.694 --> 00:06:48.777
and lived off the earnings of his wife.

00:06:49.458 --> 00:06:51.541
He pasted tarps
over the windows of his home

00:06:51.565 --> 00:06:55.095
to prevent prying eyes
during the long Icelandic winter.

00:06:55.655 --> 00:06:59.453
And he soon ran out of excuses
to explain his many absences,

00:06:59.477 --> 00:07:01.043
as he worked red-eyed,

00:07:01.067 --> 00:07:02.273
night after night,

00:07:02.297 --> 00:07:03.534
month after month.

00:07:04.122 --> 00:07:06.470
In all that time, he sat on information

00:07:06.494 --> 00:07:09.737
that would eventually bring down
the leader of his country.

00:07:10.250 --> 00:07:13.939
Now, when you're an investigative reporter
and you make an amazing discovery,

00:07:13.963 --> 00:07:17.844
such as your prime minster can be linked
to a secret offshore company,

00:07:17.868 --> 00:07:21.994
that that company has a financial
interest in Icelandic banks --

00:07:22.018 --> 00:07:24.368
the very issue he's been elected on --

00:07:24.392 --> 00:07:27.042
well, your instinct
is to scream out very loud.

00:07:28.194 --> 00:07:31.088
Instead, as one of the few people
that he could speak to,

00:07:31.112 --> 00:07:34.063
Johannes and I shared
a kind of gallows humor.

00:07:34.541 --> 00:07:36.262
"Wintris is coming," he used to say.

00:07:36.286 --> 00:07:37.815
(Laughter)

00:07:37.839 --> 00:07:39.836
(Applause)

00:07:41.464 --> 00:07:43.714
We were big fans of "Game of Thrones."

00:07:44.909 --> 00:07:48.045
When reporters like Johannes
wanted to scream,

00:07:48.069 --> 00:07:50.744
they did so inside the virtual newsroom,

00:07:50.768 --> 00:07:52.987
and then they turned
those screams into stories

00:07:53.011 --> 00:07:56.129
by going outside the documents
to court records,

00:07:56.629 --> 00:07:58.289
official company registers,

00:07:58.313 --> 00:08:02.358
and by eventually putting questions
to those that we intended to name.

00:08:03.328 --> 00:08:07.360
Panama Papers actually allowed
the reporters to look at the world

00:08:07.384 --> 00:08:10.000
through a different lens
from everybody else.

00:08:10.024 --> 00:08:11.944
As we were researching the story,

00:08:11.968 --> 00:08:13.386
unconnected to us,

00:08:13.410 --> 00:08:16.541
a major political bribery scandal
happened in Brazil.

00:08:17.489 --> 00:08:20.104
A new leader was elected in Argentina.

00:08:20.758 --> 00:08:24.649
The FBI began to indict officials at FIFA,

00:08:24.673 --> 00:08:28.476
the organization that controls
the world of professional soccer.

00:08:29.239 --> 00:08:31.516
The Panama Papers
actually had unique insights

00:08:31.540 --> 00:08:33.786
into each one of these unfolding events.

00:08:33.810 --> 00:08:37.250
So you can imagine the pressure
and the ego dramas

00:08:37.274 --> 00:08:39.763
that could have ruined
what we were trying to do.

00:08:39.787 --> 00:08:41.325
Any of one of these journalists,

00:08:41.349 --> 00:08:43.070
they could have broken the pact.

00:08:43.094 --> 00:08:44.244
But they didn't.

00:08:44.614 --> 00:08:46.182
And on April 3 this year,

00:08:46.206 --> 00:08:48.387
at exactly 8pm German time,

00:08:48.411 --> 00:08:51.888
we published simultaneously
in 76 countries.

00:08:52.370 --> 00:08:59.353
(Applause)

00:09:03.790 --> 00:09:07.402
The Panama Papers quickly became
one of the biggest stories of the year.

00:09:07.426 --> 00:09:10.630
This is the scene in Iceland
the day after we published.

00:09:10.654 --> 00:09:12.798
It was the first of many protests.

00:09:13.197 --> 00:09:15.557
The Icelandic prime minister
had to resign.

00:09:15.581 --> 00:09:17.929
It was a first of many resignations.

00:09:18.425 --> 00:09:21.988
We spotlighted many famous people
such as Lionel Messi,

00:09:22.012 --> 00:09:24.340
the most famous
soccer player in the world.

00:09:24.876 --> 00:09:27.166
And there were some
unintended consequences.

00:09:27.604 --> 00:09:31.281
These alleged members
of a Mexican drug cartel were arrested

00:09:31.305 --> 00:09:34.156
after we published details
about their hideout.

00:09:34.765 --> 00:09:36.705
They'd been using the address

00:09:36.729 --> 00:09:38.699
to register their offshore company.

00:09:38.723 --> 00:09:41.518
(Laughter)

00:09:43.241 --> 00:09:45.802
There's a kind of irony
in what we've been able to do.

00:09:45.826 --> 00:09:49.532
The technology -- the Internet --
that has broken the business model

00:09:49.556 --> 00:09:52.110
is allowing us to reinvent
journalism itself.

00:09:52.666 --> 00:09:54.354
And this dynamic is producing

00:09:54.378 --> 00:09:57.218
unprecedented levels
of transparency and impact.

00:09:57.922 --> 00:10:01.408
We showed how a group of journalists
can effect change across the world

00:10:01.432 --> 00:10:05.412
by applying new methods
and old-fashioned journalism techniques

00:10:05.436 --> 00:10:07.840
to vast amounts of leaked information.

00:10:08.469 --> 00:10:12.721
We put all-important context
around what was given to us by John Doe.

00:10:13.355 --> 00:10:14.940
And by sharing resources,

00:10:14.964 --> 00:10:16.653
we were able to dig deep --

00:10:16.677 --> 00:10:21.052
much deeper and longer than most
media organizations allow these days,

00:10:21.076 --> 00:10:22.819
because of financial concerns.

00:10:23.650 --> 00:10:25.233
Now, it was a big risk,

00:10:25.257 --> 00:10:27.245
and it wouldn't work for every story,

00:10:27.269 --> 00:10:29.273
but we showed with the Panama Papers

00:10:29.297 --> 00:10:32.235
that you can write about any country
from just about anywhere,

00:10:32.259 --> 00:10:35.773
and then choose your preferred
battleground to defend your work.

00:10:36.345 --> 00:10:37.920
Try obtaining a court injunction

00:10:37.944 --> 00:10:41.864
that would prevent the telling
of a story in 76 different countries.

00:10:42.527 --> 00:10:44.214
Try stopping the inevitable.

00:10:45.503 --> 00:10:49.233
Shortly after we published,
I got a three-word text from Johannes:

00:10:49.954 --> 00:10:52.172
"Wintris has arrived."

00:10:52.196 --> 00:10:53.594
(Laughter)

00:10:53.618 --> 00:10:57.350
It had arrived and so, too, perhaps
has a new era for journalism.

00:10:57.823 --> 00:10:58.979
Thank you.

00:10:59.003 --> 00:11:05.957
(Applause)

00:11:09.762 --> 00:11:11.422
Bruno Giussani: Gerard, thank you.

00:11:11.446 --> 00:11:14.521
I guess you're going to send
that applause to the 350 journalists

00:11:14.545 --> 00:11:16.123
who worked with you, right?

00:11:16.147 --> 00:11:18.358
Now, a couple of questions
I would like to ask.

00:11:18.382 --> 00:11:19.549
The first one is,

00:11:19.573 --> 00:11:22.241
you'd been working
in secrecy for over a year

00:11:22.265 --> 00:11:25.891
with 350-something colleagues
from all over the world --

00:11:25.915 --> 00:11:29.246
was there ever a moment when you thought

00:11:29.270 --> 00:11:31.398
that the leak may be leaked,

00:11:31.422 --> 00:11:34.125
that the collaboration may just be broken

00:11:34.149 --> 00:11:35.728
by somebody publishing a story?

00:11:35.752 --> 00:11:38.570
Or somebody not in the group
releasing some information

00:11:38.594 --> 00:11:39.915
that they got to know?

00:11:40.378 --> 00:11:43.030
Gerard Ryle: We had a series
of crises along the way,

00:11:43.054 --> 00:11:45.785
including when something major
was happening in the world,

00:11:45.809 --> 00:11:48.832
the journalists from that country
wanted to publish right away.

00:11:48.856 --> 00:11:50.065
We had to calm them down.

00:11:50.089 --> 00:11:53.233
Probably the biggest crisis we had
was a week before publication.

00:11:53.257 --> 00:11:57.268
We'd sent a series of questions
to the associates of Vladimir Putin,

00:11:57.292 --> 00:11:58.785
but instead of responding,

00:11:58.809 --> 00:12:01.772
the Kremlin actually held
a press conference and denounced us,

00:12:01.796 --> 00:12:05.213
and denounced the whole thing
as being, I guess, a plot from the West.

00:12:05.237 --> 00:12:08.253
At that point, Putin thought
it was just about him.

00:12:08.277 --> 00:12:10.781
And, of course, a lot of editors
around the world

00:12:10.805 --> 00:12:12.506
were very nervous about this.

00:12:12.530 --> 00:12:14.593
They thought the story
was going to get out.

00:12:14.617 --> 00:12:16.870
You can imagine the amount
of time they'd spent,

00:12:16.894 --> 00:12:19.053
the amount of resources,
money spent on this.

00:12:19.077 --> 00:12:22.114
So I had to basically spend
the last week calming everyone down,

00:12:22.138 --> 00:12:25.020
a bit like a general,
where you're holding your troops back:

00:12:25.044 --> 00:12:26.344
"Calm, remain calm."

00:12:26.368 --> 00:12:28.520
And then eventually,
of course, they all did.

00:12:29.473 --> 00:12:31.941
BG: And then a couple weeks ago or so,

00:12:31.965 --> 00:12:35.934
you released a lot of the documents
as an open database

00:12:35.958 --> 00:12:38.694
for everybody to search
via keyword, essentially.

00:12:39.179 --> 00:12:40.344
GR: We very much believe

00:12:40.368 --> 00:12:42.770
that the basic information
about the offshore world

00:12:42.794 --> 00:12:43.947
should be made public.

00:12:43.971 --> 00:12:46.848
Now, we didn't publish
the underlying documents

00:12:46.872 --> 00:12:48.737
of the journalists we're working with.

00:12:48.761 --> 00:12:51.343
But the basic information
such as the name of a person,

00:12:51.367 --> 00:12:54.291
what their offshore company was
and the name of that company,

00:12:54.315 --> 00:12:55.671
is now all available online.

00:12:55.695 --> 00:12:59.655
In fact, the biggest resource
of its kind basically is out there now

00:13:00.524 --> 00:13:02.397
BG: Gerard, thank you for the work you do.

00:13:02.421 --> 00:13:03.579
GR: Thank you.

00:13:03.603 --> 00:13:07.116
(Applause)
