00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:16.926
Today I stand before you
as a man who lives life to the full

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:18.190
in the here and now.

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:21.086
But for a long time,

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:22.310
I lived for death.

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:25.686
I was a young man who believed

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:30.270
that jihad is to be understood
in the language of force and violence.

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.150
I tried to right wrongs
through power and aggression.

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:42.030
I had deep concerns
for the suffering of others

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:46.150
and a strong desire
to help and bring relief to them.

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:52.606
I thought violent jihad was noble,

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:53.966
chivalrous

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:55.310
and the best way to help.

00:00:57.790 --> 00:00:59.686
At a time when so many of our people --

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:00.966
young people especially --

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:02.550
are at risk of radicalization

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:05.246
through groups like al-Qaeda,

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:07.110
Islamic State and others,

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:09.486
when these groups are claiming

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:14.566
that their horrific brutality
and violence are true jihad,

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:18.766
I want to say that their idea
of jihad is wrong --

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:20.126
completely wrong --

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:21.350
as was mine, then.

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:25.710
Jihad means to strive to one's utmost.

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:29.606
It includes exertion and spirituality,

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:31.126
self-purification

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:32.350
and devotion.

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:37.406
It refers to positive transformation

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:41.526
through learning, wisdom
and remembrance of God.

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:44.790
The word jihad stands
for all those meanings as a whole.

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:51.486
Jihad may at times
take the form of fighting,

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:52.710
but only sometimes,

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:55.070
under strict conditions,

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:58.310
within rules and limits.

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:01.206
In Islam,

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:06.230
the benefit of an act must outweigh
the harm or hardship it entails.

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:09.126
More importantly,

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:13.886
the verses in the Koran
that are connected to jihad or fighting

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:19.486
do not cancel out the verses
that talk about forgiveness,

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:20.806
benevolence

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:22.030
or patience.

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:30.046
But now I believe that there are
no circumstances on earth

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:32.646
where violent jihad is permissible,

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:35.350
because it will lead to greater harm.

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:40.446
But now the idea of jihad
has been hijacked.

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:43.806
It has been perverted
to mean violent struggle

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:46.806
wherever Muslims
are undergoing difficulties,

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:48.726
and turned into terrorism

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:51.806
by fascistic Islamists like al-Qaeda,

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:53.390
Islamic State and others.

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:56.406
But I have come to understand

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:00.366
that true jihad
means striving to the utmost

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:03.750
to strengthen and live
those qualities which God loves:

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:06.926
honesty, trustworthiness,

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:09.046
compassion, benevolence,

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:10.966
reliability, respect,

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:12.366
truthfulness --

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:15.510
human values that so many of us share.

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:20.366
I was born in Bangladesh,

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:21.819
but grew up mostly in England.

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:23.869
And I went to school here.

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:26.926
My father was an academic,

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:29.030
and we were in the UK through his work.

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:34.990
In 1971 we were in Bangladesh
when everything changed.

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:39.926
The War of Independence
impacted upon us terribly,

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:41.806
pitting family against family,

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:43.526
neighbor against neighbor.

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:46.406
And at the age of 12 I experienced war,

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:48.030
destitution in my family,

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:52.110
the deaths of 22
of my relatives in horrible ways,

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:55.910
as well as the murder of my elder brother.

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:00.950
I witnessed killing ...

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:05.966
animals feeding on corpses in the streets,

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:07.726
starvation all around me,

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:09.886
wanton, horrific violence --

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:11.110
senseless violence.

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:16.166
I was a young man,

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:19.126
teenager, fascinated by ideas.

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:20.966
I wanted to learn,

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:23.038
but I could not go to school
for four years.

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:26.366
After the War of Independence,

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:28.870
my father was put in prison
for two and a half years,

00:04:29.989 --> 00:04:32.510
and I used to visit him
every week in prison,

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:34.750
and homeschooled myself.

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:38.790
My father was released in 1973

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:42.246
and he fled to England as a refugee,

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:43.510
and we soon followed him.

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:46.526
I was 17.

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:49.006
So these experiences gave me

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:52.830
a sharp awareness of the atrocities
and injustices in the world.

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:56.286
And I had a strong desire --

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:58.326
a very keen, deep desire --

00:04:58.350 --> 00:04:59.566
to right wrongs

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:01.257
and help the victims of oppression.

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:04.686
While studying at college in the UK,

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:10.190
I met others who showed me
how I could channel that desire

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:12.590
and help through my religion.

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:15.166
And I was radicalized --

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:18.630
enough to consider violence correct,

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:22.150
even a virtue under certain circumstances.

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:27.686
So I became involved
in the jihad in Afghanistan.

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:32.270
I wanted to protect the Muslim Afghan
population against the Soviet army.

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:35.486
And I thought that was jihad:

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:37.006
my sacred duty,

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:38.750
which would be rewarded by God.

00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:46.030
I became a preacher.

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:53.206
I was one of the pioneers
of violent jihad in the UK.

00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:54.726
I recruited,

00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:56.430
I raised funds, I trained.

00:05:57.510 --> 00:06:00.046
I confused true jihad

00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:04.070
with this perversion
as presented by the fascist Islamists --

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:08.886
these people who use the idea of jihad

00:06:08.910 --> 00:06:12.790
to justify their lust for power,
authority and control on earth:

00:06:13.895 --> 00:06:18.206
a perversion perpetuated today
by fascist Islamist groups

00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:21.110
like al-Qaeda, Islamic State and others.

00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:24.430
For a period of around 15 years,

00:06:25.630 --> 00:06:29.430
I fought for short periods of time

00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:32.126
in Kashmir and Burma,

00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:33.470
besides Afghanistan.

00:06:37.150 --> 00:06:39.870
Our aim was to remove the invaders,

00:06:40.910 --> 00:06:43.990
to bring relief to the oppressed victims

00:06:45.030 --> 00:06:48.166
and of course to establish
an Islamic state,

00:06:48.190 --> 00:06:49.910
a caliphate for God's rule.

00:06:50.870 --> 00:06:52.070
And I did this openly.

00:06:53.630 --> 00:06:55.910
I didn't break any laws.

00:06:56.590 --> 00:06:59.686
I was proud and grateful to be British --

00:06:59.710 --> 00:07:01.286
I still am.

00:07:01.310 --> 00:07:04.950
And I bore no hostility
against this, my country,

00:07:06.110 --> 00:07:09.646
nor enmity towards
the non-Muslim citizens,

00:07:09.670 --> 00:07:11.070
and I still don't.

00:07:13.990 --> 00:07:16.366
During one battle in Afghanistan,

00:07:16.390 --> 00:07:19.270
some British men and I
formed a special bond

00:07:20.110 --> 00:07:22.846
with a 15-year-old Afghani boy,

00:07:22.870 --> 00:07:24.070
Abdullah,

00:07:24.990 --> 00:07:27.326
an innocent, loving and lovable kid

00:07:27.350 --> 00:07:29.390
who was always eager to please.

00:07:31.110 --> 00:07:32.310
He was poor.

00:07:32.910 --> 00:07:35.630
And boys like him
did menial tasks in the camp.

00:07:36.630 --> 00:07:37.916
And he seemed happy enough,

00:07:38.630 --> 00:07:40.046
but I couldn't help wonder --

00:07:40.070 --> 00:07:41.975
his parents must have missed him dearly.

00:07:43.710 --> 00:07:47.270
And they must have dreamt
about a better future for him.

00:07:49.710 --> 00:07:52.526
A victim of circumstance
caught up in a war,

00:07:52.550 --> 00:07:53.830
cruelly thrust upon him

00:07:54.870 --> 00:07:57.110
by the cruel circumstances of the time.

00:08:00.830 --> 00:08:05.550
One day I picked up this unexploded
mortar shell in a trench,

00:08:06.470 --> 00:08:10.270
and I had it deposited
in a makeshift mud hut lab.

00:08:11.430 --> 00:08:14.366
And I went out on a short,
pointless skirmish --

00:08:14.390 --> 00:08:15.590
always pointless,

00:08:16.590 --> 00:08:20.030
And I came back a few hours later
to discover he was dead.

00:08:21.310 --> 00:08:24.086
He had tried to recover
explosives from that shell.

00:08:24.110 --> 00:08:26.710
It exploded, and he died a violent death,

00:08:27.590 --> 00:08:31.870
blown to bits by the very same device
that had proved harmless to me.

00:08:33.230 --> 00:08:34.750
So I started to question.

00:08:36.750 --> 00:08:40.470
How did his death serve any purpose?

00:08:42.430 --> 00:08:44.430
Why did he die and I lived?

00:08:45.709 --> 00:08:47.206
I carried on.

00:08:47.230 --> 00:08:48.846
I fought in Kashmir.

00:08:48.870 --> 00:08:51.566
I also recruited for the Philippines,

00:08:51.590 --> 00:08:53.390
Bosnia and Chechnya.

00:08:54.709 --> 00:08:55.990
And the questions grew.

00:08:58.030 --> 00:08:59.926
Later in Burma,

00:08:59.950 --> 00:09:02.286
I came across Rohingya fighters,

00:09:02.310 --> 00:09:04.566
who were barely teenagers,

00:09:04.590 --> 00:09:06.246
born and brought up in the jungle,

00:09:06.270 --> 00:09:08.330
carrying machine guns
and grenade launchers.

00:09:12.150 --> 00:09:17.350
I met two 13-year-olds
with soft manners and gentle voices.

00:09:19.070 --> 00:09:20.286
Looking at me,

00:09:20.310 --> 00:09:22.390
they begged me
to take them away to England.

00:09:28.870 --> 00:09:30.750
They simply wanted to go to school --

00:09:31.830 --> 00:09:33.150
that was their dream.

00:09:36.510 --> 00:09:37.726
My family --

00:09:37.750 --> 00:09:39.206
my children of the same age --

00:09:39.230 --> 00:09:41.190
were living at home in the UK,

00:09:42.190 --> 00:09:43.486
going to school,

00:09:43.510 --> 00:09:44.710
living a safe life.

00:09:46.030 --> 00:09:47.286
And I couldn't help wonder

00:09:47.310 --> 00:09:50.766
how much these young boys
must have spoken to one another

00:09:50.790 --> 00:09:52.990
about their dreams for such a life.

00:09:55.070 --> 00:09:56.990
Victims of circumstances:

00:09:58.510 --> 00:09:59.790
these two young boys,

00:10:00.470 --> 00:10:03.526
sleeping rough on the ground,
looking up at the stars,

00:10:03.550 --> 00:10:06.046
cynically exploited by their leaders

00:10:06.070 --> 00:10:08.550
for their personal lust
for glory and power.

00:10:10.070 --> 00:10:13.286
I soon witnessed boys like them
killing one another

00:10:13.310 --> 00:10:15.550
in conflicts between rival groups.

00:10:17.550 --> 00:10:19.910
And it was the same everywhere ...

00:10:21.430 --> 00:10:23.926
Afghanistan, Kashmir, Burma,

00:10:23.950 --> 00:10:25.430
Philippines, Chechnya;

00:10:26.390 --> 00:10:31.006
petty warlords got the young
and vulnerable to kill one another

00:10:31.030 --> 00:10:32.350
in the name of jihad.

00:10:34.390 --> 00:10:36.230
Muslims against Muslims.

00:10:37.790 --> 00:10:42.166
Not protecting anyone
against invaders or occupiers;

00:10:42.190 --> 00:10:44.190
not bringing relief to the oppressed.

00:10:46.390 --> 00:10:47.766
Children being used,

00:10:47.790 --> 00:10:49.406
cynically exploited;

00:10:49.430 --> 00:10:51.366
people dying in conflicts

00:10:51.390 --> 00:10:54.430
which I was supporting
in the name of jihad.

00:10:57.070 --> 00:10:58.710
And it still carries on today.

00:11:03.950 --> 00:11:07.566
Realizing that the violent jihad

00:11:07.590 --> 00:11:11.790
I had engaged in abroad

00:11:13.590 --> 00:11:15.630
was so different --

00:11:17.430 --> 00:11:22.166
such a chasm between
what I had experienced

00:11:22.190 --> 00:11:23.990
and what I thought was sacred duty --

00:11:24.790 --> 00:11:27.750
I had to reflect
on my activities here in the UK.

00:11:30.390 --> 00:11:32.446
I had to consider my preaching,

00:11:32.470 --> 00:11:34.006
recruiting, fund-raising,

00:11:34.030 --> 00:11:35.606
training,

00:11:35.630 --> 00:11:37.750
but most importantly, radicalizing --

00:11:38.790 --> 00:11:41.006
sending young people to fight and die

00:11:41.030 --> 00:11:42.246
as I was doing --

00:11:42.270 --> 00:11:44.030
all totally wrong.

00:11:47.830 --> 00:11:51.030
So I got involved
in violent jihad in the mid '80s,

00:11:52.110 --> 00:11:53.590
starting with Afghanistan.

00:11:54.750 --> 00:11:58.030
And by the time I finished
it was in the year 2000.

00:11:59.190 --> 00:12:00.766
I was completely immersed in it.

00:12:00.790 --> 00:12:02.726
All around me people supported,

00:12:02.750 --> 00:12:03.966
applauded,

00:12:03.990 --> 00:12:06.390
even celebrated what
we were doing in their name.

00:12:08.310 --> 00:12:10.126
But by the time I learned to get out,

00:12:10.150 --> 00:12:12.766
completely disillusioned in the year 2000,

00:12:12.790 --> 00:12:14.470
15 years had passed.

00:12:17.350 --> 00:12:18.590
So what goes wrong?

00:12:20.870 --> 00:12:23.710
We were so busy talking about virtue,

00:12:25.310 --> 00:12:28.470
and we were blinded by a cause.

00:12:32.390 --> 00:12:36.670
And we did not give ourselves a chance
to develop a virtuous character.

00:12:37.830 --> 00:12:41.966
We told ourselves
we were fighting for the oppressed,

00:12:41.990 --> 00:12:44.190
but these were unwinnable wars.

00:12:45.870 --> 00:12:49.486
We became the very instrument
through which more deaths occurred,

00:12:49.510 --> 00:12:53.246
complicit in causing further misery

00:12:53.270 --> 00:12:55.870
for the selfish benefit of the cruel few.

00:13:04.430 --> 00:13:05.646
So over time,

00:13:05.670 --> 00:13:06.870
a very long time,

00:13:08.750 --> 00:13:09.950
I opened my eyes.

00:13:12.110 --> 00:13:13.590
I began to dare

00:13:15.190 --> 00:13:16.846
to face the truth,

00:13:16.870 --> 00:13:18.070
to think,

00:13:19.510 --> 00:13:21.646
to face the hard questions.

00:13:21.670 --> 00:13:23.870
I got in touch with my soul.

00:13:34.230 --> 00:13:35.550
What have I learned?

00:13:36.790 --> 00:13:41.350
That people who engage
in violent jihadism,

00:13:43.110 --> 00:13:45.710
that people who are drawn
to these types of extremisms,

00:13:46.750 --> 00:13:48.950
are not that different to everyone else.

00:13:50.030 --> 00:13:52.830
But I believe such people can change.

00:13:54.270 --> 00:13:57.126
They can regain their hearts
and restore them

00:13:57.150 --> 00:14:00.210
by filling them
with human values that heal.

00:14:07.150 --> 00:14:09.366
When we ignore the realities,

00:14:09.390 --> 00:14:15.150
we discover that we accept what
we are told without critical reflection.

00:14:17.790 --> 00:14:21.566
And we ignore the gifts and advantages
that many of us would cherish

00:14:21.590 --> 00:14:23.870
even for a single moment in their lives.

00:14:28.550 --> 00:14:30.910
I engaged in actions
I thought were correct.

00:14:33.910 --> 00:14:37.910
But now I began to question
how I knew what I knew.

00:14:39.990 --> 00:14:43.686
I endlessly told others
to accept the truth,

00:14:43.710 --> 00:14:47.430
but I failed to give doubt
its rightful place.

00:14:53.070 --> 00:14:57.926
This conviction that people can change
is rooted in my experience,

00:14:57.950 --> 00:14:59.150
my own journey.

00:15:00.670 --> 00:15:02.566
Through wide reading,

00:15:02.590 --> 00:15:03.790
reflecting,

00:15:04.310 --> 00:15:06.206
contemplation, self-knowledge,

00:15:06.230 --> 00:15:07.446
I discovered,

00:15:07.470 --> 00:15:13.110
I realized that Islamists' world
of us and them is false and unjust.

00:15:16.950 --> 00:15:20.630
Through considering the uncertainties
in all that we had asserted,

00:15:21.550 --> 00:15:23.166
to the inviolable truths,

00:15:23.190 --> 00:15:24.590
incontestable truths,

00:15:27.110 --> 00:15:29.990
I developed a more nuanced understanding.

00:15:36.630 --> 00:15:41.110
I realized that in a world crowded
with variation and contradiction,

00:15:42.070 --> 00:15:43.286
foolish preachers,

00:15:43.310 --> 00:15:46.326
only foolish preachers
like I used to be,

00:15:46.350 --> 00:15:51.710
see no paradox in the myths and fictions
they use to assert authenticity.

00:15:53.270 --> 00:15:57.806
So I understood the vital
importance of self-knowledge,

00:15:57.830 --> 00:15:59.030
political awareness

00:16:00.150 --> 00:16:04.806
and the necessity
for a deep and wide understanding

00:16:04.830 --> 00:16:07.286
of our commitments and our actions,

00:16:07.310 --> 00:16:08.630
how they affect others.

00:16:10.670 --> 00:16:12.126
So my plea today to everyone,

00:16:12.150 --> 00:16:16.630
especially those who sincerely
believe in Islamist jihadism ...

00:16:18.630 --> 00:16:21.030
refuse dogmatic authority;

00:16:22.510 --> 00:16:26.190
let go of anger, hatred and violence;

00:16:27.270 --> 00:16:28.926
learn to right wrongs

00:16:28.950 --> 00:16:34.020
without even attempting to justify
cruel, unjust and futile behavior.

00:16:36.990 --> 00:16:40.326
Instead create a few
beautiful and useful things

00:16:40.350 --> 00:16:41.550
that outlive us.

00:16:45.350 --> 00:16:47.206
Approach the world, life,

00:16:47.230 --> 00:16:48.430
with love.

00:16:50.150 --> 00:16:51.366
Learn to develop

00:16:51.390 --> 00:16:52.646
or cultivate your hearts

00:16:52.670 --> 00:16:56.030
to see goodness, beauty and truth
in others and in the world.

00:16:57.150 --> 00:16:59.670
That way we do matter
more to ourselves ...

00:17:01.390 --> 00:17:02.590
to each other,

00:17:03.310 --> 00:17:04.526
to our communities

00:17:04.550 --> 00:17:06.030
and, for me, to God.

00:17:07.150 --> 00:17:08.766
This is jihad --

00:17:08.790 --> 00:17:09.990
my true jihad.

00:17:11.070 --> 00:17:12.286
Thank you.

00:17:12.310 --> 00:17:14.750
(Applause)
