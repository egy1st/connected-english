WEBVTT

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:15.326
I was a new mother

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:16.606
and a young rabbi

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:18.486
in the spring of 2004

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:20.750
and the world was in shambles.

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:22.646
Maybe you remember.

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:25.806
Every day, we heard devastating reports
from the war in Iraq.

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:29.686
There were waves of terror
rolling across the globe.

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:32.390
It seemed like humanity
was spinning out of control.

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:35.006
I remember the night that I read

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:37.166
about the series of coordinated bombings

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:39.886
in the subway system in Madrid,

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:41.966
and I got up and I walked over to the crib

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:44.406
where my six-month-old baby girl

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.286
lay sleeping sweetly,

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:48.646
and I heard the rhythm of her breath,

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:52.246
and I felt this sense of urgency
coursing through my body.

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:56.326
We were living through a time
of tectonic shifts in ideologies,

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:59.006
in politics, in religion, in populations.

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:01.110
Everything felt so precarious.

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:02.886
And I remember thinking,

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.510
"My God, what kind of world
did we bring this child into?

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.166
And what was I as a mother
and a religious leader

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:11.710
willing to do about it?

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:17.766
Of course, I knew it was clear

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.686
that religion would be
a principle battlefield

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:23.166
in this rapidly changing landscape,

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:24.886
and it was already clear

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:27.630
that religion was a significant
part of the problem.

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:29.526
The question for me was,

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:32.030
could religion
also be part of the solution?

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:34.246
Now, throughout history,

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:37.486
people have committed
horrible crimes and atrocities

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:39.150
in the name of religion.

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:42.766
And as we entered the 21st century,

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:47.510
it was very clear that religious extremism
was once again on the rise.

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:49.166
Our studies now show

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:52.446
that over the course
of the past 15, 20 years,

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.606
hostilities and religion-related violence

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.566
have been on the increase
all over the world.

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:59.846
But we don't even need
the studies to prove it,

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:03.046
because I ask you,
how many of us are surprised today

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:06.846
when we hear the stories
of a bombing or a shooting,

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:09.686
when we later find out
that the last word that was uttered

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:12.526
before the trigger is pulled
or the bomb is detonated

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:14.166
is the name of God?

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:16.846
It barely raises an eyebrow today

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:18.806
when we learn that yet another person

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:21.366
has decided to show his love of God

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:23.630
by taking the lives of God's children.

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:27.246
In America, religious extremism

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:31.806
looks like a white,
antiabortion Christian extremist

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:35.046
walking into Planned Parenthood
in Colorado Springs

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:36.926
and murdering three people.

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:39.206
It also looks like a couple

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:41.046
inspired by the Islamic State

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:45.686
walking into an office party
in San Bernardino and killing 14.

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:50.526
And even when religion-related extremism
does not lead to violence,

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:53.566
it is still used
as a political wedge issue,

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:57.686
cynically leading people
to justify the subordination of women,

00:02:57.710 --> 00:03:00.166
the stigmatization of LGBT people,

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:03.790
racism, Islamophobia and anti-Semitism.

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:06.566
This ought to concern deeply

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:09.526
those of us who care
about the future of religion

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:11.766
and the future of faith.

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:14.166
We need to call this what it is:

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:16.350
a great failure of religion.

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:22.110
But the thing is, this isn't even the only
challenge that religion faces today.

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:25.926
At the very same time

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:29.566
that we need religion
to be a strong force against extremism,

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:32.606
it is suffering
from a second pernicious trend,

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:35.430
what I call religious routine-ism.

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:38.566
This is when our institutions
and our leaders

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:42.366
are stuck in a paradigm
that is rote and perfunctory,

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:44.446
devoid of life, devoid of vision

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:46.190
and devoid of soul.

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:49.046
Let me explain what I mean like this.

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:51.846
One of the great blessings
of being a rabbi

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:56.526
is standing under the chuppah,
under the wedding canopy, with a couple,

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:58.806
and helping them proclaim publicly

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:02.086
and make holy the love
that they found for one another.

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:04.046
I want to ask you now, though,

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:05.966
to think maybe from your own experience

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:07.406
or maybe just imagine it

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:10.326
about the difference
between the intensity of the experience

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:12.086
under the wedding canopy,

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:15.326
and maybe the experience
of the sixth or seventh anniversary.

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:17.806
(Laughter)

00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:21.726
And if you're lucky enough
to make it 16 or 17 years,

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:24.726
if you're like most people,
you probably wake up in the morning

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:28.286
realizing that you forgot to make
a reservation at your favorite restaurant

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:29.926
and you forgot so much as a card,

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:33.030
and then you just hope and pray
that your partner also forgot.

00:04:34.109 --> 00:04:36.726
Well, religious ritual and rites

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:40.286
were essentially designed
to serve the function of the anniversary,

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:44.326
to be a container in which
we would hold on to the remnants

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:47.246
of that sacred, revelatory encounter

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:49.366
that birthed the religion
in the first place.

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:51.886
The problem is that after a few centuries,

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:54.150
the date remains on the calendar,

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:57.686
but the love affair is long dead.

00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:02.006
That's when we find ourselves
in endless, mindless repetitions

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:04.246
of words that don't mean anything to us,

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:08.006
rising and being seated
because someone has asked us to,

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:10.926
holding onto jealously guarded doctrine

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:14.806
that's completely and wildly out of step
with our contemporary reality,

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:17.366
engaging in perfunctory practice

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:20.910
simply because that's the way
things have always been done.

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:25.726
Religion is waning in the United States.

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:29.686
Across the board,
churches and synagogues and mosques

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:31.310
are all complaining

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:36.126
about how hard it is to maintain relevance

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:40.286
for a generation of young people
who seem completely uninterested,

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:43.966
not only in the institutions
that stand at the heart of our traditions

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:46.566
but even in religion itself.

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:48.630
And what they need to understand

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:52.166
is that there is today
a generation of people

00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:56.046
who are as disgusted by the violence
of religious extremism

00:05:56.070 --> 00:05:57.766
as they are turned off

00:05:57.790 --> 00:06:01.110
by the lifelessness
of religious routine-ism.

00:06:02.590 --> 00:06:06.630
Of course there is
a bright spot to this story.

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:11.406
Given the crisis of these two
concurrent trends in religious life,

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:15.126
about 12 or 13 years ago,
I set out to try to determine

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:16.686
if there was any way

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:20.886
that I could reclaim the heart
of my own Jewish tradition,

00:06:20.910 --> 00:06:23.526
to help make it meaningful
and purposeful again

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:24.990
in a world on fire.

00:06:25.670 --> 00:06:27.086
I started to wonder,

00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:31.246
what if we could harness
some of the great minds of our generation

00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:35.246
and think in a bold and robust
and imaginative way again

00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:38.366
about what the next iteration
of religious life would look like?

00:06:38.390 --> 00:06:41.446
Now, we had no money,
no space, no game plan,

00:06:41.470 --> 00:06:42.926
but we did have email.

00:06:42.950 --> 00:06:46.646
So my friend Melissa and I
sat down and we wrote an email

00:06:46.670 --> 00:06:49.526
which we sent out
to a few friends and colleagues.

00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:51.366
It basically said this:

00:06:51.390 --> 00:06:53.310
"Before you bail on religion,

00:06:54.590 --> 00:06:56.766
why don't we come together
this Friday night

00:06:56.790 --> 00:07:00.910
and see what we might make
of our own Jewish inheritance?"

00:07:01.430 --> 00:07:04.046
We hoped maybe 20 people would show up.

00:07:04.070 --> 00:07:06.630
It turned out 135 people came.

00:07:07.150 --> 00:07:09.686
They were cynics and seekers,

00:07:09.710 --> 00:07:11.446
atheists and rabbis.

00:07:11.470 --> 00:07:14.006
Many people said that night
that it was the first time

00:07:14.030 --> 00:07:18.326
that they had a meaningful religious
experience in their entire lives.

00:07:18.350 --> 00:07:20.686
And so I set out to do the only
rational thing

00:07:20.710 --> 00:07:22.846
that someone would do
in such a circumstance:

00:07:22.870 --> 00:07:27.806
I quit my job and tried to build
this audacious dream,

00:07:27.830 --> 00:07:30.870
a reinvented, rethought religious life

00:07:31.670 --> 00:07:33.886
which we called "IKAR,"

00:07:33.910 --> 00:07:37.086
which means "the essence"
or "the heart of the matter."

00:07:37.110 --> 00:07:39.206
Now, IKAR is not alone

00:07:39.230 --> 00:07:41.766
out there in the religious
landscape today.

00:07:41.790 --> 00:07:45.606
There are Jewish and Christian
and Muslim and Catholic religious leaders,

00:07:45.630 --> 00:07:47.926
many of them women, by the way,

00:07:47.950 --> 00:07:51.966
who have set out to reclaim
the heart of our traditions,

00:07:51.990 --> 00:07:57.190
who firmly believe that now is the time
for religion to be part of the solution.

00:07:57.750 --> 00:08:00.206
We are going back
into our sacred traditions

00:08:00.230 --> 00:08:02.966
and recognizing that all of our traditions

00:08:02.990 --> 00:08:07.286
contain the raw material
to justify violence and extremism,

00:08:07.310 --> 00:08:12.126
and also contain the raw material
to justify compassion,

00:08:12.150 --> 00:08:14.566
coexistence and kindness --

00:08:14.590 --> 00:08:19.406
that when others choose to read our texts
as directives for hate and vengeance,

00:08:19.430 --> 00:08:22.046
we can choose to read those same texts

00:08:22.070 --> 00:08:25.670
as directives for love
and for forgiveness.

00:08:26.270 --> 00:08:27.766
I have found now

00:08:27.790 --> 00:08:32.270
in communities as varied
as Jewish indie start-ups on the coasts

00:08:33.030 --> 00:08:34.926
to a woman's mosque,

00:08:34.950 --> 00:08:38.606
to black churches
in New York and in North Carolina,

00:08:38.630 --> 00:08:40.926
to a holy bus loaded with nuns

00:08:40.950 --> 00:08:44.309
that traverses this country
with a message of justice and peace,

00:08:45.189 --> 00:08:48.045
that there is a shared religious ethos

00:08:48.069 --> 00:08:53.726
that is now emerging in the form
of revitalized religion in this country.

00:08:53.750 --> 00:08:57.886
And while the theologies
and the practices vary very much

00:08:57.910 --> 00:09:00.606
between these independent communities,

00:09:00.630 --> 00:09:04.046
what we can see are some common,
consistent threads between them.

00:09:04.070 --> 00:09:07.110
I'm going to share with you
four of those commitments now.

00:09:07.950 --> 00:09:10.166
The first is wakefulness.

00:09:10.190 --> 00:09:12.086
We live in a time today

00:09:12.110 --> 00:09:14.606
in which we have unprecedented access

00:09:14.630 --> 00:09:17.526
to information about every global tragedy

00:09:17.550 --> 00:09:20.006
that happens on every corner
of this Earth.

00:09:20.030 --> 00:09:22.726
Within 12 hours, 20 million people

00:09:22.750 --> 00:09:25.326
saw that image
of Aylan Kurdi's little body

00:09:25.350 --> 00:09:27.726
washed up on the Turkish shore.

00:09:27.750 --> 00:09:30.110
We all saw this picture.

00:09:31.070 --> 00:09:33.406
We saw this picture
of a five-year-old child

00:09:33.430 --> 00:09:36.870
pulled out of the rubble
of his building in Aleppo.

00:09:37.310 --> 00:09:39.686
And once we see these images,

00:09:39.710 --> 00:09:42.350
we are called to a certain kind of action.

00:09:42.670 --> 00:09:47.086
My tradition tells a story
of a traveler who is walking down a road

00:09:47.110 --> 00:09:50.646
when he sees a beautiful house on fire,

00:09:50.670 --> 00:09:54.206
and he says, "How can it be
that something so beautiful would burn,

00:09:54.230 --> 00:09:56.766
and nobody seems to even care?"

00:09:56.790 --> 00:09:59.886
So too we learn that our world is on fire,

00:09:59.910 --> 00:10:03.646
and it is our job to keep our hearts
and our eyes open,

00:10:03.670 --> 00:10:06.206
and to recognize
that it's our responsibility

00:10:06.230 --> 00:10:08.806
to help put out the flames.

00:10:08.830 --> 00:10:10.886
This is extremely difficult to do.

00:10:10.910 --> 00:10:14.686
Psychologists tell us that the more
we learn about what's broken in our world,

00:10:14.710 --> 00:10:17.046
the less likely we are to do anything.

00:10:17.070 --> 00:10:18.646
It's called psychic numbing.

00:10:18.670 --> 00:10:21.230
We just shut down at a certain point.

00:10:21.670 --> 00:10:25.726
Well, somewhere along the way,
our religious leaders forgot

00:10:25.750 --> 00:10:29.046
that it's our job
to make people uncomfortable.

00:10:29.070 --> 00:10:31.126
It's our job to wake people up,

00:10:31.150 --> 00:10:33.286
to pull them out of their apathy

00:10:33.310 --> 00:10:34.766
and into the anguish,

00:10:34.790 --> 00:10:38.246
and to insist that we do
what we don't want to do

00:10:38.270 --> 00:10:41.606
and see what we do not want to see.

00:10:41.630 --> 00:10:44.006
Because we know
that social change only happens --

00:10:44.030 --> 00:10:45.086
(Applause)

00:10:45.110 --> 00:10:48.990
when we are awake enough
to see that the house is on fire.

00:10:49.910 --> 00:10:51.846
The second principle is hope,

00:10:51.870 --> 00:10:53.490
and I want to say this about hope.

00:10:53.514 --> 00:10:55.646
Hope is not naive,

00:10:55.670 --> 00:10:57.606
and hope is not an opiate.

00:10:57.630 --> 00:11:01.686
Hope may be the single
greatest act of defiance

00:11:01.710 --> 00:11:04.046
against a politics of pessimism

00:11:04.070 --> 00:11:06.486
and against a culture of despair.

00:11:06.510 --> 00:11:08.406
Because what hope does for us

00:11:08.430 --> 00:11:11.206
is it lifts us out of the container

00:11:11.230 --> 00:11:14.926
that holds us and constrains us
from the outside,

00:11:14.950 --> 00:11:18.686
and says, "You can dream
and think expansively again.

00:11:18.710 --> 00:11:21.110
That they cannot control in you."

00:11:21.910 --> 00:11:24.926
I saw hope made manifest
in an African-American church

00:11:24.950 --> 00:11:27.486
in the South Side of Chicago this summer,

00:11:27.510 --> 00:11:29.166
where I brought my little girl,

00:11:29.190 --> 00:11:30.406
who is now 13

00:11:30.430 --> 00:11:32.126
and a few inches taller than me,

00:11:32.150 --> 00:11:34.950
to hear my friend Rev. Otis Moss preach.

00:11:35.710 --> 00:11:41.206
That summer, there had already been
3,000 people shot

00:11:41.230 --> 00:11:44.550
between January and July in Chicago.

00:11:45.190 --> 00:11:48.286
We went into that church
and heard Rev. Moss preach,

00:11:48.310 --> 00:11:50.246
and after he did,

00:11:50.270 --> 00:11:54.526
this choir of gorgeous women,
100 women strong,

00:11:54.550 --> 00:11:56.510
stood up and began to sing.

00:11:57.350 --> 00:12:00.486
"I need you. You need me.

00:12:00.510 --> 00:12:03.190
I love you. I need you to survive."

00:12:03.870 --> 00:12:05.566
And I realized in that moment

00:12:05.590 --> 00:12:09.166
that this is what religion
is supposed to be about.

00:12:09.190 --> 00:12:13.886
It's supposed to be about
giving people back a sense of purpose,

00:12:13.910 --> 00:12:15.406
a sense of hope,

00:12:15.430 --> 00:12:20.366
a sense that they and their dreams
fundamentally matter in this world

00:12:20.390 --> 00:12:22.950
that tells them
that they don't matter at all.

00:12:23.910 --> 00:12:26.686
The third principle
is the principle of mightiness.

00:12:26.710 --> 00:12:29.366
There's a rabbinic tradition
that we are to walk around

00:12:29.390 --> 00:12:31.686
with two slips of paper in our pockets.

00:12:31.710 --> 00:12:35.126
One says, "I am but dust and ashes."

00:12:35.150 --> 00:12:36.846
It's not all about me.

00:12:36.870 --> 00:12:40.390
I can't control everything,
and I cannot do this on my own.

00:12:41.110 --> 00:12:45.286
The other slip of paper says,
"For my sake the world was created."

00:12:45.310 --> 00:12:48.430
Which is to say it's true
that I can't do everything,

00:12:49.190 --> 00:12:51.390
but I can surely do something.

00:12:52.310 --> 00:12:53.966
I can forgive.

00:12:53.990 --> 00:12:55.190
I can love.

00:12:55.710 --> 00:12:57.206
I can show up.

00:12:57.230 --> 00:12:58.846
I can protest.

00:12:58.870 --> 00:13:02.046
I can be a part of this conversation.

00:13:02.070 --> 00:13:04.926
We even now have a religious ritual,

00:13:04.950 --> 00:13:06.166
a posture,

00:13:06.190 --> 00:13:09.886
that holds the paradox
between powerlessness and power.

00:13:09.910 --> 00:13:11.126
In the Jewish community,

00:13:11.150 --> 00:13:14.446
the only time of year
that we prostrate fully to the ground

00:13:14.470 --> 00:13:16.126
is during the high holy days.

00:13:16.150 --> 00:13:18.390
It's a sign of total submission.

00:13:18.990 --> 00:13:22.046
Now in our community,
when we get up off the ground,

00:13:22.070 --> 00:13:25.566
we stand with our hands
raised to the heavens,

00:13:25.590 --> 00:13:31.206
and we say, "I am strong,
I am mighty, and I am worthy.

00:13:31.230 --> 00:13:34.590
I can't do everything,
but I can do something."

00:13:35.870 --> 00:13:40.766
In a world that conspires
to make us believe that we are invisible

00:13:40.790 --> 00:13:42.326
and that we are impotent,

00:13:42.350 --> 00:13:45.086
religious communities and religious ritual

00:13:45.110 --> 00:13:48.726
can remind us that for whatever
amount of time we have here on this Earth,

00:13:48.750 --> 00:13:51.206
whatever gifts and blessings
we were given,

00:13:51.230 --> 00:13:52.966
whatever resources we have,

00:13:52.990 --> 00:13:55.326
we can and we must use them

00:13:55.350 --> 00:13:57.926
to try to make the world
a little bit more just

00:13:57.950 --> 00:13:59.331
and a little bit more loving.

00:14:00.070 --> 00:14:03.006
The fourth and final
is interconnectedness.

00:14:03.030 --> 00:14:06.286
A few years ago, there was a man
walking on the beach in Alaska,

00:14:06.310 --> 00:14:08.246
when he came across a soccer ball

00:14:08.270 --> 00:14:10.766
that had some Japanese
letters written on it.

00:14:10.790 --> 00:14:14.126
He took a picture of it
and posted it up on social media,

00:14:14.150 --> 00:14:16.846
and a Japanese teenager contacted him.

00:14:16.870 --> 00:14:20.646
He had lost everything in the tsunami
that devastated his country,

00:14:20.670 --> 00:14:23.366
but he was able
to retrieve that soccer ball

00:14:23.390 --> 00:14:26.406
after it had floated
all the way across the Pacific.

00:14:26.430 --> 00:14:29.206
How small our world has become.

00:14:29.230 --> 00:14:34.046
It's so hard for us to remember
how interconnected we all are

00:14:34.070 --> 00:14:35.270
as human beings.

00:14:36.870 --> 00:14:38.846
And yet, we know

00:14:38.870 --> 00:14:41.566
that it is systems of oppression

00:14:41.590 --> 00:14:45.686
that benefit the most
from the lie of radical individualism.

00:14:45.710 --> 00:14:47.526
Let me tell you how this works.

00:14:47.550 --> 00:14:49.486
I'm not supposed to care

00:14:49.510 --> 00:14:51.966
when black youth are harassed by police,

00:14:51.990 --> 00:14:54.286
because my white-looking Jewish kids

00:14:54.310 --> 00:14:58.206
probably won't ever get pulled over
for the crime of driving while black.

00:14:58.230 --> 00:15:02.246
Well, not so, because
this is also my problem.

00:15:02.270 --> 00:15:05.446
And guess what?
Transphobia and Islamophobia

00:15:05.470 --> 00:15:09.006
and racism of all forms,
those are also all of our problems.

00:15:09.030 --> 00:15:12.486
And so too is anti-Semitism
all of our problems.

00:15:12.510 --> 00:15:14.206
Because Emma Lazarus was right.

00:15:14.230 --> 00:15:16.550
(Applause)

00:15:19.710 --> 00:15:23.046
Emma Lazarus was right
when she said until all of us are free,

00:15:23.070 --> 00:15:25.006
we are none of us free.

00:15:25.030 --> 00:15:27.110
We are all in this together.

00:15:27.950 --> 00:15:31.446
And now somewhere at the intersection
of these four trends,

00:15:31.470 --> 00:15:36.206
of wakefulness and hope
and mightiness and interconnectedness,

00:15:36.230 --> 00:15:40.766
there is a burgeoning, multifaith
justice movement in this country

00:15:40.790 --> 00:15:43.046
that is staking a claim on a countertrend,

00:15:43.070 --> 00:15:48.206
saying that religion can and must be
a force for good in the world.

00:15:48.230 --> 00:15:52.246
Our hearts hurt from
the failed religion of extremism,

00:15:52.270 --> 00:15:56.486
and we deserve more
than the failed religion of routine-ism.

00:15:56.510 --> 00:16:00.286
It is time for religious leaders
and religious communities

00:16:00.310 --> 00:16:03.686
to take the lead in the spiritual
and cultural shift

00:16:03.710 --> 00:16:07.406
that this country and the world
so desperately needs --

00:16:07.430 --> 00:16:09.566
a shift toward love,

00:16:09.590 --> 00:16:13.486
toward justice, toward equality
and toward dignity for all.

00:16:13.510 --> 00:16:16.950
I believe that our children
deserve no less than that.

00:16:17.510 --> 00:16:18.726
Thank you.

00:16:18.750 --> 00:16:26.274
(Applause)
