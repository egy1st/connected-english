WEBVTT

00:00:15.116 --> 00:00:18.933
I'm going to talk a little bit
about where technology's going.

00:00:19.659 --> 00:00:22.330
And often technology comes to us,

00:00:22.716 --> 00:00:24.581
we're surprised by what it brings.

00:00:24.605 --> 00:00:28.288
But there's actually
a large aspect of technology

00:00:28.312 --> 00:00:30.114
that's much more predictable,

00:00:30.138 --> 00:00:34.226
and that's because technological systems
of all sorts have leanings,

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:35.425
they have urgencies,

00:00:35.449 --> 00:00:37.010
they have tendencies.

00:00:37.034 --> 00:00:41.966
And those tendencies are derived
from the very nature of the physics,

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:45.140
chemistry of wires
and switches and electrons,

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:49.411
and they will make reoccurring
patterns again and again.

00:00:49.895 --> 00:00:54.769
And so those patterns produce
these tendencies, these leanings.

00:00:54.793 --> 00:00:57.624
You can almost think of it
as sort of like gravity.

00:00:57.648 --> 00:00:59.967
Imagine raindrops falling into a valley.

00:00:59.991 --> 00:01:03.079
The actual path of a raindrop
as it goes down the valley

00:01:03.103 --> 00:01:04.272
is unpredictable.

00:01:04.801 --> 00:01:06.319
We cannot see where it's going,

00:01:06.343 --> 00:01:08.620
but the general direction
is very inevitable:

00:01:08.644 --> 00:01:09.878
it's downward.

00:01:10.527 --> 00:01:15.099
And so these baked-in
tendencies and urgencies

00:01:15.123 --> 00:01:16.599
in technological systems

00:01:17.201 --> 00:01:20.810
give us a sense of where things
are going at the large form.

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:22.700
So in a large sense,

00:01:22.724 --> 00:01:26.085
I would say that telephones
were inevitable,

00:01:27.155 --> 00:01:28.497
but the iPhone was not.

00:01:29.244 --> 00:01:30.722
The Internet was inevitable,

00:01:31.424 --> 00:01:32.710
but Twitter was not.

00:01:33.186 --> 00:01:37.114
So we have many ongoing
tendencies right now,

00:01:37.138 --> 00:01:39.858
and I think one of the chief among them

00:01:39.882 --> 00:01:43.604
is this tendency to make things
smarter and smarter.

00:01:44.191 --> 00:01:46.403
I call it cognifying -- cognification --

00:01:46.933 --> 00:01:49.715
also known as artificial
intelligence, or AI.

00:01:50.175 --> 00:01:53.921
And I think that's going to be one
of the most influential developments

00:01:53.945 --> 00:01:59.520
and trends and directions and drives
in our society in the next 20 years.

00:02:00.171 --> 00:02:02.156
So, of course, it's already here.

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:04.384
We already have AI,

00:02:04.408 --> 00:02:06.806
and often it works in the background,

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:08.416
in the back offices of hospitals,

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:13.126
where it's used to diagnose X-rays
better than a human doctor.

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:14.876
It's in legal offices,

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:17.268
where it's used to go
through legal evidence

00:02:17.292 --> 00:02:19.147
better than a human paralawyer.

00:02:19.656 --> 00:02:23.312
It's used to fly the plane
that you came here with.

00:02:24.315 --> 00:02:26.696
Human pilots only flew it
seven to eight minutes,

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:28.673
the rest of the time the AI was driving.

00:02:28.697 --> 00:02:30.870
And of course, in Netflix and Amazon,

00:02:30.894 --> 00:02:33.424
it's in the background,
making those recommendations.

00:02:33.448 --> 00:02:34.709
That's what we have today.

00:02:34.733 --> 00:02:39.534
And we have an example, of course,
in a more front-facing aspect of it,

00:02:39.558 --> 00:02:46.187
with the win of the AlphaGo, who beat
the world's greatest Go champion.

00:02:46.628 --> 00:02:50.681
But it's more than that.

00:02:50.705 --> 00:02:53.347
If you play a video game,
you're playing against an AI.

00:02:53.371 --> 00:02:57.909
But recently, Google taught their AI

00:02:57.933 --> 00:03:00.345
to actually learn how to play video games.

00:03:00.836 --> 00:03:03.545
Again, teaching video games
was already done,

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:07.466
but learning how to play
a video game is another step.

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:09.168
That's artificial smartness.

00:03:10.721 --> 00:03:15.243
What we're doing is taking
this artificial smartness

00:03:15.267 --> 00:03:17.690
and we're making it smarter and smarter.

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:22.755
There are three aspects
to this general trend

00:03:22.779 --> 00:03:24.468
that I think are underappreciated;

00:03:24.492 --> 00:03:26.769
I think we would understand
AI a lot better

00:03:26.793 --> 00:03:29.094
if we understood these three things.

00:03:29.118 --> 00:03:32.401
I think these things also would
help us embrace AI,

00:03:32.425 --> 00:03:35.433
because it's only by embracing it
that we actually can steer it.

00:03:36.037 --> 00:03:39.194
We can actually steer the specifics
by embracing the larger trend.

00:03:39.617 --> 00:03:42.596
So let me talk about
those three different aspects.

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:46.293
The first one is: our own intelligence
has a very poor understanding

00:03:46.317 --> 00:03:47.807
of what intelligence is.

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:51.913
We tend to think of intelligence
as a single dimension,

00:03:51.937 --> 00:03:54.687
that it's kind of like a note
that gets louder and louder.

00:03:54.711 --> 00:03:57.318
It starts like with IQ measurement.

00:03:57.342 --> 00:04:01.434
It starts with maybe a simple
low IQ in a rat or mouse,

00:04:01.458 --> 00:04:03.592
and maybe there's more in a chimpanzee,

00:04:04.037 --> 00:04:06.228
and then maybe there's more
in a stupid person,

00:04:06.252 --> 00:04:08.348
and then maybe an average
person like myself,

00:04:08.372 --> 00:04:09.662
and then maybe a genius.

00:04:09.686 --> 00:04:14.119
And this single IQ intelligence
is getting greater and greater.

00:04:14.666 --> 00:04:15.817
That's completely wrong.

00:04:15.841 --> 00:04:19.449
That's not what intelligence is --
not what human intelligence is, anyway.

00:04:19.823 --> 00:04:24.329
It's much more like a symphony
of different notes,

00:04:24.353 --> 00:04:27.962
and each of these notes is played
on a different instrument of cognition.

00:04:27.986 --> 00:04:31.687
There are many types
of intelligences in our own minds.

00:04:31.711 --> 00:04:34.759
We have deductive reasoning,

00:04:34.783 --> 00:04:37.004
we have emotional intelligence,

00:04:37.028 --> 00:04:38.421
we have spatial intelligence;

00:04:38.445 --> 00:04:42.466
we have maybe 100 different types
that are all grouped together,

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:46.395
and they vary in different strengths
with different people.

00:04:46.419 --> 00:04:50.945
And of course, if we go to animals,
they also have another basket --

00:04:50.969 --> 00:04:53.510
another symphony of different
kinds of intelligences,

00:04:53.534 --> 00:04:57.100
and sometimes those same instruments
are the same that we have.

00:04:57.124 --> 00:05:00.685
They can think in the same way,
but they may have a different arrangement,

00:05:00.709 --> 00:05:03.176
and maybe they're higher
in some cases than humans,

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:06.037
like long-term memory in a squirrel
is actually phenomenal,

00:05:06.061 --> 00:05:08.348
so it can remember
where it buried its nuts.

00:05:08.372 --> 00:05:10.359
But in other cases they may be lower.

00:05:10.383 --> 00:05:13.113
When we go to make machines,

00:05:13.137 --> 00:05:15.333
we're going to engineer
them in the same way,

00:05:15.357 --> 00:05:20.367
where we'll make some of those types
of smartness much greater than ours,

00:05:20.391 --> 00:05:22.962
and many of them won't be
anywhere near ours,

00:05:22.986 --> 00:05:24.530
because they're not needed.

00:05:24.554 --> 00:05:26.757
So we're going to take these things,

00:05:26.781 --> 00:05:28.862
these artificial clusters,

00:05:28.886 --> 00:05:34.248
and we'll be adding more varieties
of artificial cognition to our AIs.

00:05:34.657 --> 00:05:38.728
We're going to make them
very, very specific.

00:05:38.752 --> 00:05:45.294
So your calculator is smarter
than you are in arithmetic already;

00:05:45.318 --> 00:05:49.015
your GPS is smarter
than you are in spatial navigation;

00:05:49.487 --> 00:05:53.745
Google, Bing, are smarter
than you are in long-term memory.

00:05:54.489 --> 00:05:59.019
And we're going to take, again,
these kinds of different types of thinking

00:05:59.043 --> 00:06:00.976
and we'll put them into, like, a car.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.057
The reason why we want to put them
in a car so the car drives,

00:06:04.081 --> 00:06:06.383
is because it's not driving like a human.

00:06:06.407 --> 00:06:07.803
It's not thinking like us.

00:06:07.827 --> 00:06:09.747
That's the whole feature of it.

00:06:09.771 --> 00:06:11.306
It's not being distracted,

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:14.084
it's not worrying about whether
it left the stove on,

00:06:14.108 --> 00:06:16.246
or whether it should have
majored in finance.

00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:17.423
It's just driving.

00:06:17.447 --> 00:06:18.589
(Laughter)

00:06:18.613 --> 00:06:20.454
Just driving, OK?

00:06:20.478 --> 00:06:23.415
And we actually might even
come to advertise these

00:06:23.439 --> 00:06:24.984
as "consciousness-free."

00:06:25.008 --> 00:06:26.782
They're without consciousness,

00:06:26.806 --> 00:06:28.910
they're not concerned about those things,

00:06:28.934 --> 00:06:30.090
they're not distracted.

00:06:30.114 --> 00:06:33.080
So in general, what we're trying to do

00:06:33.104 --> 00:06:37.604
is make as many different
types of thinking as we can.

00:06:37.954 --> 00:06:40.037
We're going to populate the space

00:06:40.061 --> 00:06:44.220
of all the different possible types,
or species, of thinking.

00:06:44.244 --> 00:06:46.312
And there actually may be some problems

00:06:46.336 --> 00:06:49.136
that are so difficult
in business and science

00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:53.202
that our own type of human thinking
may not be able to solve them alone.

00:06:53.226 --> 00:06:55.218
We may need a two-step program,

00:06:55.242 --> 00:06:59.445
which is to invent new kinds of thinking

00:06:59.842 --> 00:07:03.576
that we can work alongside of to solve
these really large problems,

00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:06.518
say, like dark energy or quantum gravity.

00:07:08.646 --> 00:07:11.292
What we're doing
is making alien intelligences.

00:07:11.316 --> 00:07:15.385
You might even think of this
as, sort of, artificial aliens

00:07:15.409 --> 00:07:16.616
in some senses.

00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:18.940
And they're going to help
us think different,

00:07:18.964 --> 00:07:22.596
because thinking different
is the engine of creation

00:07:22.620 --> 00:07:24.487
and wealth and new economy.

00:07:25.985 --> 00:07:30.908
The second aspect of this
is that we are going to use AI

00:07:30.932 --> 00:07:33.882
to basically make a second
Industrial Revolution.

00:07:34.285 --> 00:07:37.058
The first Industrial Revolution
was based on the fact

00:07:37.082 --> 00:07:40.544
that we invented something
I would call artificial power.

00:07:41.029 --> 00:07:42.179
Previous to that,

00:07:42.203 --> 00:07:44.237
during the Agricultural Revolution,

00:07:44.261 --> 00:07:47.963
everything that was made
had to be made with human muscle

00:07:47.987 --> 00:07:49.294
or animal power.

00:07:49.715 --> 00:07:51.778
That was the only way
to get anything done.

00:07:51.802 --> 00:07:54.747
The great innovation during
the Industrial Revolution was,

00:07:54.771 --> 00:07:57.880
we harnessed steam power, fossil fuels,

00:07:57.904 --> 00:08:01.760
to make this artificial power
that we could use

00:08:01.784 --> 00:08:03.453
to do anything we wanted to do.

00:08:03.477 --> 00:08:06.249
So today when you drive down the highway,

00:08:06.721 --> 00:08:11.246
you are, with a flick of the switch,
commanding 250 horses --

00:08:11.270 --> 00:08:12.842
250 horsepower --

00:08:12.866 --> 00:08:17.558
which we can use to build skyscrapers,
to build cities, to build roads,

00:08:17.582 --> 00:08:23.371
to make factories that would churn out
lines of chairs or refrigerators

00:08:23.395 --> 00:08:25.049
way beyond our own power.

00:08:25.073 --> 00:08:31.184
And that artificial power can also
be distributed on wires on a grid

00:08:31.208 --> 00:08:34.407
to every home, factory, farmstead,

00:08:34.431 --> 00:08:38.622
and anybody could buy
that artificial power,

00:08:38.646 --> 00:08:40.118
just by plugging something in.

00:08:40.142 --> 00:08:42.581
So this was a source
of innovation as well,

00:08:42.605 --> 00:08:46.023
because a farmer could take
a manual hand pump,

00:08:46.047 --> 00:08:48.963
and they could add this artificial
power, this electricity,

00:08:48.987 --> 00:08:50.484
and he'd have an electric pump.

00:08:50.508 --> 00:08:53.826
And you multiply that by thousands
or tens of thousands of times,

00:08:53.850 --> 00:08:57.009
and that formula was what brought us
the Industrial Revolution.

00:08:57.033 --> 00:09:00.618
All the things that we see,
all this progress that we now enjoy,

00:09:00.642 --> 00:09:02.705
has come from the fact
that we've done that.

00:09:02.729 --> 00:09:05.077
We're going to do
the same thing now with AI.

00:09:05.101 --> 00:09:07.176
We're going to distribute that on a grid,

00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:09.574
and now you can take that electric pump.

00:09:09.598 --> 00:09:12.566
You can add some artificial intelligence,

00:09:12.590 --> 00:09:14.071
and now you have a smart pump.

00:09:14.095 --> 00:09:16.023
And that, multiplied by a million times,

00:09:16.047 --> 00:09:18.410
is going to be this second
Industrial Revolution.

00:09:18.434 --> 00:09:20.816
So now the car is going down the highway,

00:09:20.840 --> 00:09:25.134
it's 250 horsepower,
but in addition, it's 250 minds.

00:09:25.158 --> 00:09:26.927
That's the auto-driven car.

00:09:26.951 --> 00:09:28.340
It's like a new commodity;

00:09:28.364 --> 00:09:29.667
it's a new utility.

00:09:29.691 --> 00:09:32.732
The AI is going to flow
across the grid -- the cloud --

00:09:32.756 --> 00:09:34.323
in the same way electricity did.

00:09:34.347 --> 00:09:36.727
So everything that we had electrified,

00:09:36.751 --> 00:09:38.474
we're now going to cognify.

00:09:38.843 --> 00:09:40.228
And I would suggest, then,

00:09:40.252 --> 00:09:43.984
that the formula
for the next 10,000 start-ups

00:09:44.008 --> 00:09:45.170
is very, very simple,

00:09:45.194 --> 00:09:48.361
which is to take x and add AI.

00:09:49.250 --> 00:09:52.062
That is the formula,
that's what we're going to be doing.

00:09:52.086 --> 00:09:55.392
And that is the way
in which we're going to make

00:09:55.416 --> 00:09:57.274
this second Industrial Revolution.

00:09:57.298 --> 00:09:59.452
And by the way -- right now, this minute,

00:09:59.476 --> 00:10:00.645
you can log on to Google

00:10:00.669 --> 00:10:04.551
and you can purchase
AI for six cents, 100 hits.

00:10:04.908 --> 00:10:06.512
That's available right now.

00:10:06.536 --> 00:10:08.822
So the third aspect of this

00:10:09.465 --> 00:10:12.143
is that when we take this AI
and embody it,

00:10:12.167 --> 00:10:13.340
we get robots.

00:10:13.364 --> 00:10:15.067
And robots are going to be bots,

00:10:15.091 --> 00:10:18.419
they're going to be doing many
of the tasks that we have already done.

00:10:20.507 --> 00:10:22.035
A job is just a bunch of tasks,

00:10:22.059 --> 00:10:23.821
so they're going to redefine our jobs

00:10:23.845 --> 00:10:26.104
because they're going to do
some of those tasks.

00:10:26.128 --> 00:10:29.325
But they're also going to create
whole new categories,

00:10:29.349 --> 00:10:31.596
a whole new slew of tasks

00:10:31.620 --> 00:10:34.077
that we didn't know
we wanted to do before.

00:10:34.101 --> 00:10:37.738
They're going to actually
engender new kinds of jobs,

00:10:37.762 --> 00:10:40.033
new kinds of tasks that we want done,

00:10:40.057 --> 00:10:43.462
just as automation made up
a whole bunch of new things

00:10:43.486 --> 00:10:45.320
that we didn't know we needed before,

00:10:45.344 --> 00:10:47.300
and now we can't live without them.

00:10:47.324 --> 00:10:51.280
So they're going to produce
even more jobs than they take away,

00:10:51.304 --> 00:10:54.738
but it's important that a lot of the tasks
that we're going to give them

00:10:54.762 --> 00:10:59.334
are tasks that can be defined
in terms of efficiency or productivity.

00:10:59.826 --> 00:11:01.654
If you can specify a task,

00:11:01.678 --> 00:11:03.913
either manual or conceptual,

00:11:03.937 --> 00:11:08.717
that can be specified in terms
of efficiency or productivity,

00:11:08.741 --> 00:11:10.518
that goes to the bots.

00:11:10.908 --> 00:11:13.086
Productivity is for robots.

00:11:13.110 --> 00:11:16.180
What we're really good at
is basically wasting time.

00:11:16.204 --> 00:11:17.232
(Laughter)

00:11:17.256 --> 00:11:19.572
We're really good at things
that are inefficient.

00:11:19.596 --> 00:11:22.621
Science is inherently inefficient.

00:11:22.966 --> 00:11:25.872
It runs on that fact that you have
one failure after another.

00:11:25.896 --> 00:11:29.320
It runs on the fact that you make tests
and experiments that don't work,

00:11:29.344 --> 00:11:30.786
otherwise you're not learning.

00:11:30.810 --> 00:11:31.972
It runs on the fact

00:11:31.996 --> 00:11:34.079
that there is not
a lot of efficiency in it.

00:11:34.103 --> 00:11:36.882
Innovation by definition is inefficient,

00:11:36.906 --> 00:11:38.297
because you make prototypes,

00:11:38.321 --> 00:11:41.028
because you try stuff that fails,
that doesn't work.

00:11:41.052 --> 00:11:44.164
Exploration is inherently inefficiency.

00:11:44.188 --> 00:11:45.719
Art is not efficient.

00:11:45.743 --> 00:11:47.870
Human relationships are not efficient.

00:11:47.894 --> 00:11:50.834
These are all the kinds of things
we're going to gravitate to,

00:11:50.858 --> 00:11:52.333
because they're not efficient.

00:11:52.357 --> 00:11:54.672
Efficiency is for robots.

00:11:55.488 --> 00:11:59.611
We're also going to learn
that we're going to work with these AIs

00:11:59.635 --> 00:12:01.632
because they think differently than us.

00:12:02.155 --> 00:12:06.469
When Deep Blue beat
the world's best chess champion,

00:12:06.493 --> 00:12:08.422
people thought it was the end of chess.

00:12:08.446 --> 00:12:12.848
But actually, it turns out that today,
the best chess champion in the world

00:12:12.872 --> 00:12:14.429
is not an AI.

00:12:15.056 --> 00:12:16.237
And it's not a human.

00:12:16.261 --> 00:12:18.976
It's the team of a human and an AI.

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:23.000
The best medical diagnostician
is not a doctor, it's not an AI,

00:12:23.024 --> 00:12:24.200
it's the team.

00:12:24.224 --> 00:12:26.373
We're going to be working with these AIs,

00:12:26.397 --> 00:12:28.392
and I think you'll be paid in the future

00:12:28.416 --> 00:12:30.807
by how well you work with these bots.

00:12:31.176 --> 00:12:35.433
So that's the third thing,
is that they're different,

00:12:35.457 --> 00:12:36.622
they're utility

00:12:36.646 --> 00:12:40.462
and they are going to be something
we work with rather than against.

00:12:40.486 --> 00:12:43.125
We're working with these
rather than against them.

00:12:43.149 --> 00:12:44.626
So, the future:

00:12:44.650 --> 00:12:46.070
Where does that take us?

00:12:46.094 --> 00:12:49.661
I think that 25 years from now,
they'll look back

00:12:49.685 --> 00:12:52.810
and look at our understanding
of AI and say,

00:12:52.834 --> 00:12:56.134
"You didn't have AI. In fact,
you didn't even have the Internet yet,

00:12:56.158 --> 00:12:58.899
compared to what we're going
to have 25 years from now."

00:12:59.999 --> 00:13:03.046
There are no AI experts right now.

00:13:03.070 --> 00:13:04.769
There's a lot of money going to it,

00:13:04.793 --> 00:13:07.061
there are billions of dollars
being spent on it;

00:13:07.085 --> 00:13:09.249
it's a huge business,

00:13:09.273 --> 00:13:13.545
but there are no experts, compared
to what we'll know 20 years from now.

00:13:14.214 --> 00:13:17.099
So we are just at the beginning
of the beginning,

00:13:17.123 --> 00:13:19.286
we're in the first hour of all this.

00:13:19.310 --> 00:13:21.245
We're in the first hour of the Internet.

00:13:21.269 --> 00:13:23.309
We're in the first hour of what's coming.

00:13:23.333 --> 00:13:27.486
The most popular AI product
in 20 years from now,

00:13:27.510 --> 00:13:28.954
that everybody uses,

00:13:29.649 --> 00:13:31.193
has not been invented yet.

00:13:32.614 --> 00:13:35.081
That means that you're not late.

00:13:35.834 --> 00:13:36.985
Thank you.

00:13:37.009 --> 00:13:38.035
(Laughter)

00:13:38.059 --> 00:13:40.816
(Applause)
