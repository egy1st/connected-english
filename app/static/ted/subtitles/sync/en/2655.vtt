00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:15.221
Here's a startling fact:

00:00:15.245 --> 00:00:18.966
in the 45 years since the introduction
of the automated teller machine,

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:21.846
those vending machines that dispense cash,

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:25.046
the number of human bank tellers
employed in the United States

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:26.326
has roughly doubled,

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:29.646
from about a quarter of a million
to a half a million.

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:32.706
A quarter of a million in 1970
to about a half a million today,

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:36.966
with 100,000 added since the year 2000.

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:39.406
These facts, revealed in a recent book

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:42.566
by Boston University
economist James Bessen,

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:44.766
raise an intriguing question:

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:46.686
what are all those tellers doing,

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.726
and why hasn't automation
eliminated their employment by now?

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:52.086
If you think about it,

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:55.246
many of the great inventions
of the last 200 years

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:58.070
were designed to replace human labor.

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:00.646
Tractors were developed

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:05.006
to substitute mechanical power
for human physical toil.

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:07.366
Assembly lines were engineered

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:10.726
to replace inconsistent human handiwork

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:12.686
with machine perfection.

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:15.926
Computers were programmed to swap out

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:18.606
error-prone, inconsistent
human calculation

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.390
with digital perfection.

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:23.086
These inventions have worked.

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:25.166
We no longer dig ditches by hand,

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:27.246
pound tools out of wrought iron

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.550
or do bookkeeping using actual books.

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:35.126
And yet, the fraction of US adults
employed in the labor market

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:38.006
is higher now in 2016

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:40.766
than it was 125 years ago, in 1890,

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:43.806
and it's risen in just about every decade

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:46.150
in the intervening 125 years.

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:48.390
This poses a paradox.

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:51.966
Our machines increasingly
do our work for us.

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:56.126
Why doesn't this make our labor redundant
and our skills obsolete?

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:59.846
Why are there still so many jobs?

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:01.606
(Laughter)

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:03.966
I'm going to try to answer
that question tonight,

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:07.726
and along the way, I'm going to tell you
what this means for the future of work

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:11.926
and the challenges that automation
does and does not pose

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:13.390
for our society.

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:16.430
Why are there so many jobs?

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:21.206
There are actually two fundamental
economic principles at stake.

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:23.926
One has to do with human genius

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:25.366
and creativity.

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:28.246
The other has to do
with human insatiability,

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:29.846
or greed, if you like.

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:32.606
I'm going to call the first of these
the O-ring principle,

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:34.806
and it determines
the type of work that we do.

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:37.446
The second principle
is the never-get-enough principle,

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:40.950
and it determines how many jobs
there actually are.

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:43.926
Let's start with the O-ring.

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:46.726
ATMs, automated teller machines,

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:50.086
had two countervailing effects
on bank teller employment.

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:52.806
As you would expect,
they replaced a lot of teller tasks.

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:55.510
The number of tellers per branch
fell by about a third.

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:00.206
But banks quickly discovered that it
also was cheaper to open new branches,

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:03.366
and the number of bank branches
increased by about 40 percent

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:04.886
in the same time period.

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:08.990
The net result was more branches
and more tellers.

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:13.006
But those tellers were doing
somewhat different work.

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:16.686
As their routine,
cash-handling tasks receded,

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:18.846
they became less like checkout clerks

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:20.686
and more like salespeople,

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:22.766
forging relationships with customers,

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:24.006
solving problems

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:28.246
and introducing them to new products
like credit cards, loans and investments:

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:32.110
more tellers doing
a more cognitively demanding job.

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:34.630
There's a general principle here.

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:36.966
Most of the work that we do

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:40.470
requires a multiplicity of skills,

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:44.486
and brains and brawn,

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:48.126
technical expertise and intuitive mastery,

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:51.110
perspiration and inspiration
in the words of Thomas Edison.

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:54.886
In general, automating
some subset of those tasks

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:57.126
doesn't make the other ones unnecessary.

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:00.110
In fact, it makes them more important.

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:03.206
It increases their economic value.

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:05.246
Let me give you a stark example.

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:09.086
In 1986, the space shuttle Challenger

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:11.406
exploded and crashed back down to Earth

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:13.350
less than two minutes after takeoff.

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:16.966
The cause of that crash, it turned out,

00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:20.526
was an inexpensive rubber O-ring
in the booster rocket

00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:23.406
that had frozen on the launchpad
the night before

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:26.806
and failed catastrophically
moments after takeoff.

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:29.645
In this multibillion dollar enterprise

00:04:29.669 --> 00:04:31.366
that simple rubber O-ring

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:33.965
made the difference
between mission success

00:04:33.989 --> 00:04:36.830
and the calamitous death
of seven astronauts.

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:41.486
An ingenious metaphor
for this tragic setting

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:43.726
is the O-ring production function,

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:46.246
named by Harvard economist Michael Kremer

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:48.286
after the Challenger disaster.

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:50.886
The O-ring production function
conceives of the work

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:53.246
as a series of interlocking steps,

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:54.526
links in a chain.

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:58.246
Every one of those links must hold
for the mission to succeed.

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:00.406
If any of them fails,

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:03.726
the mission, or the product
or the service,

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:05.070
comes crashing down.

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:10.646
This precarious situation
has a surprisingly positive implication,

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:12.566
which is that improvements

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:15.566
in the reliability
of any one link in the chain

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:19.366
increases the value
of improving any of the other links.

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:24.366
Concretely, if most of the links
are brittle and prone to breakage,

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:26.846
the fact that your link
is not that reliable

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:28.126
is not that important.

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:30.150
Probably something else will break anyway.

00:05:30.174 --> 00:05:34.166
But as all the other links
become robust and reliable,

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:37.686
the importance of your link
becomes more essential.

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:40.030
In the limit, everything depends upon it.

00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:44.326
The reason the O-ring was critical
to space shuttle Challenger

00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:47.070
is because everything else
worked perfectly.

00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:50.206
If the Challenger were
kind of the space era equivalent

00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:52.766
of Microsoft Windows 2000 --

00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:54.886
(Laughter)

00:05:54.910 --> 00:05:57.366
the reliability of the O-ring
wouldn't have mattered

00:05:57.390 --> 00:05:59.248
because the machine would have crashed.

00:05:59.272 --> 00:06:00.752
(Laughter)

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:03.686
Here's the broader point.

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:07.526
In much of the work that we do,
we are the O-rings.

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:11.086
Yes, ATMs could do
certain cash-handling tasks

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:14.126
faster and better than tellers,

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:16.206
but that didn't make tellers superfluous.

00:06:16.230 --> 00:06:19.526
It increased the importance
of their problem-solving skills

00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:22.166
and their relationships with customers.

00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:25.486
The same principle applies
if we're building a building,

00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:28.046
if we're diagnosing
and caring for a patient,

00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:31.206
or if we are teaching a class

00:06:31.230 --> 00:06:33.686
to a roomful of high schoolers.

00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:36.086
As our tools improve,

00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:38.206
technology magnifies our leverage

00:06:38.230 --> 00:06:42.126
and increases the importance
of our expertise

00:06:42.150 --> 00:06:44.350
and our judgment and our creativity.

00:06:45.150 --> 00:06:47.390
And that brings me
to the second principle:

00:06:48.310 --> 00:06:49.510
never get enough.

00:06:50.430 --> 00:06:52.846
You may be thinking, OK, O-ring, got it,

00:06:52.870 --> 00:06:55.966
that says the jobs that people do
will be important.

00:06:55.990 --> 00:06:58.966
They can't be done by machines,
but they still need to be done.

00:06:58.990 --> 00:07:01.886
But that doesn't tell me
how many jobs there will need to be.

00:07:01.910 --> 00:07:04.366
If you think about it,
isn't it kind of self-evident

00:07:04.390 --> 00:07:06.926
that once we get sufficiently
productive at something,

00:07:06.950 --> 00:07:09.046
we've basically
worked our way out of a job?

00:07:09.070 --> 00:07:11.846
In 1900, 40 percent of all US employment

00:07:11.870 --> 00:07:13.126
was on farms.

00:07:13.150 --> 00:07:15.406
Today, it's less than two percent.

00:07:15.430 --> 00:07:17.606
Why are there so few farmers today?

00:07:17.630 --> 00:07:19.486
It's not because we're eating less.

00:07:19.510 --> 00:07:22.166
(Laughter)

00:07:22.190 --> 00:07:24.926
A century of productivity
growth in farming

00:07:24.950 --> 00:07:27.126
means that now,
a couple of million farmers

00:07:27.150 --> 00:07:29.886
can feed a nation of 320 million.

00:07:29.910 --> 00:07:31.566
That's amazing progress,

00:07:31.590 --> 00:07:35.726
but it also means there are
only so many O-ring jobs left in farming.

00:07:35.750 --> 00:07:38.766
So clearly, technology can eliminate jobs.

00:07:38.790 --> 00:07:40.526
Farming is only one example.

00:07:40.550 --> 00:07:42.190
There are many others like it.

00:07:43.590 --> 00:07:47.566
But what's true about a single product
or service or industry

00:07:47.590 --> 00:07:50.366
has never been true
about the economy as a whole.

00:07:50.390 --> 00:07:52.886
Many of the industries
in which we now work --

00:07:52.910 --> 00:07:55.046
health and medicine,

00:07:55.070 --> 00:07:57.286
finance and insurance,

00:07:57.310 --> 00:07:58.950
electronics and computing --

00:07:59.870 --> 00:08:02.606
were tiny or barely existent
a century ago.

00:08:02.630 --> 00:08:05.446
Many of the products
that we spend a lot of our money on --

00:08:05.470 --> 00:08:07.606
air conditioners, sport utility vehicles,

00:08:07.630 --> 00:08:09.326
computers and mobile devices --

00:08:09.350 --> 00:08:11.006
were unattainably expensive,

00:08:11.030 --> 00:08:13.470
or just hadn't been invented
a century ago.

00:08:14.070 --> 00:08:19.046
As automation frees our time,
increases the scope of what is possible,

00:08:19.070 --> 00:08:22.286
we invent new products,
new ideas, new services

00:08:22.310 --> 00:08:23.886
that command our attention,

00:08:23.910 --> 00:08:25.446
occupy our time

00:08:25.470 --> 00:08:27.110
and spur consumption.

00:08:27.910 --> 00:08:31.126
You may think some
of these things are frivolous --

00:08:31.150 --> 00:08:33.926
extreme yoga, adventure tourism,

00:08:33.950 --> 00:08:35.206
Pokémon GO --

00:08:35.230 --> 00:08:36.550
and I might agree with you.

00:08:37.129 --> 00:08:40.606
But people desire these things,
and they're willing to work hard for them.

00:08:40.630 --> 00:08:42.806
The average worker in 2015

00:08:42.830 --> 00:08:47.086
wanting to attain
the average living standard in 1915

00:08:47.110 --> 00:08:50.446
could do so by working
just 17 weeks a year,

00:08:50.470 --> 00:08:51.910
one third of the time.

00:08:52.390 --> 00:08:54.566
But most people don't choose to do that.

00:08:54.590 --> 00:08:56.285
They are willing to work hard

00:08:56.309 --> 00:09:00.190
to harvest the technological bounty
that is available to them.

00:09:00.630 --> 00:09:04.726
Material abundance has never
eliminated perceived scarcity.

00:09:04.750 --> 00:09:07.326
In the words of economist
Thorstein Veblen,

00:09:07.350 --> 00:09:09.990
invention is the mother of necessity.

00:09:11.670 --> 00:09:12.870
Now ...

00:09:13.550 --> 00:09:15.406
So if you accept these two principles,

00:09:15.430 --> 00:09:18.326
the O-ring principle
and the never-get-enough principle,

00:09:18.350 --> 00:09:19.686
then you agree with me.

00:09:19.710 --> 00:09:21.110
There will be jobs.

00:09:21.710 --> 00:09:23.886
Does that mean there's
nothing to worry about?

00:09:23.910 --> 00:09:26.686
Automation, employment, robots and jobs --

00:09:26.710 --> 00:09:28.630
it'll all take care of itself?

00:09:29.270 --> 00:09:30.486
No.

00:09:30.510 --> 00:09:32.566
That is not my argument.

00:09:32.590 --> 00:09:35.126
Automation creates wealth

00:09:35.150 --> 00:09:37.726
by allowing us to do
more work in less time.

00:09:37.750 --> 00:09:39.326
There is no economic law

00:09:39.350 --> 00:09:42.126
that says that we
will use that wealth well,

00:09:42.150 --> 00:09:43.950
and that is worth worrying about.

00:09:44.950 --> 00:09:46.766
Consider two countries,

00:09:46.790 --> 00:09:48.926
Norway and Saudi Arabia.

00:09:48.950 --> 00:09:50.526
Both oil-rich nations,

00:09:50.550 --> 00:09:54.126
it's like they have money
spurting out of a hole in the ground.

00:09:54.150 --> 00:09:55.686
(Laughter)

00:09:55.710 --> 00:10:00.926
But they haven't used that wealth
equally well to foster human prosperity,

00:10:00.950 --> 00:10:02.150
human prospering.

00:10:02.590 --> 00:10:05.326
Norway is a thriving democracy.

00:10:05.350 --> 00:10:09.006
By and large, its citizens
work and play well together.

00:10:09.030 --> 00:10:12.046
It's typically numbered
between first and fourth

00:10:12.070 --> 00:10:14.806
in rankings of national happiness.

00:10:14.830 --> 00:10:17.486
Saudi Arabia is an absolute monarchy

00:10:17.510 --> 00:10:21.126
in which many citizens
lack a path for personal advancement.

00:10:21.150 --> 00:10:24.646
It's typically ranked 35th
among nations in happiness,

00:10:24.670 --> 00:10:26.766
which is low for such a wealthy nation.

00:10:26.790 --> 00:10:28.126
Just by way of comparison,

00:10:28.150 --> 00:10:30.950
the US is typically ranked
around 12th or 13th.

00:10:31.550 --> 00:10:33.646
The difference between these two countries

00:10:33.670 --> 00:10:34.926
is not their wealth

00:10:34.950 --> 00:10:36.686
and it's not their technology.

00:10:36.710 --> 00:10:38.030
It's their institutions.

00:10:38.710 --> 00:10:41.886
Norway has invested to build a society

00:10:41.910 --> 00:10:45.246
with opportunity and economic mobility.

00:10:45.270 --> 00:10:47.446
Saudi Arabia has raised living standards

00:10:47.470 --> 00:10:50.726
while frustrating
many other human strivings.

00:10:50.750 --> 00:10:53.526
Two countries, both wealthy,

00:10:53.550 --> 00:10:55.270
not equally well off.

00:10:56.030 --> 00:11:00.366
And this brings me
to the challenge that we face today,

00:11:00.390 --> 00:11:02.526
the challenge that
automation poses for us.

00:11:02.550 --> 00:11:05.006
The challenge is not
that we're running out of work.

00:11:05.030 --> 00:11:06.966
The US has added 14 million jobs

00:11:06.990 --> 00:11:09.126
since the depths of the Great Recession.

00:11:09.150 --> 00:11:11.686
The challenge is that many of those jobs

00:11:11.710 --> 00:11:13.006
are not good jobs,

00:11:13.030 --> 00:11:16.126
and many citizens
cannot qualify for the good jobs

00:11:16.150 --> 00:11:17.350
that are being created.

00:11:17.990 --> 00:11:21.486
Employment growth in the United States
and in much of the developed world

00:11:21.510 --> 00:11:22.966
looks something like a barbell

00:11:22.990 --> 00:11:26.366
with increasing poundage
on either end of the bar.

00:11:26.390 --> 00:11:27.606
On the one hand,

00:11:27.630 --> 00:11:30.446
you have high-education, high-wage jobs

00:11:30.470 --> 00:11:34.046
like doctors and nurses,
programmers and engineers,

00:11:34.070 --> 00:11:35.806
marketing and sales managers.

00:11:35.830 --> 00:11:38.846
Employment is robust in these jobs,
employment growth.

00:11:38.870 --> 00:11:42.886
Similarly, employment growth
is robust in many low-skill,

00:11:42.910 --> 00:11:45.966
low-education jobs like food service,

00:11:45.990 --> 00:11:48.246
cleaning, security,

00:11:48.270 --> 00:11:49.510
home health aids.

00:11:50.230 --> 00:11:53.326
Simultaneously, employment is shrinking

00:11:53.350 --> 00:11:57.406
in many middle-education,
middle-wage, middle-class jobs,

00:11:57.430 --> 00:12:01.246
like blue-collar production
and operative positions

00:12:01.270 --> 00:12:04.246
and white-collar
clerical and sales positions.

00:12:04.270 --> 00:12:06.526
The reasons behind this contracting middle

00:12:06.550 --> 00:12:07.766
are not mysterious.

00:12:07.790 --> 00:12:09.766
Many of those middle-skill jobs

00:12:09.790 --> 00:12:12.286
use well-understood rules and procedures

00:12:12.310 --> 00:12:15.406
that can increasingly
be codified in software

00:12:15.430 --> 00:12:17.790
and executed by computers.

00:12:18.350 --> 00:12:21.726
The challenge that
this phenomenon creates,

00:12:21.750 --> 00:12:24.286
what economists call
employment polarization,

00:12:24.310 --> 00:12:26.926
is that it knocks out rungs
in the economic ladder,

00:12:26.950 --> 00:12:28.766
shrinks the size of the middle class

00:12:28.790 --> 00:12:31.926
and threatens to make us
a more stratified society.

00:12:31.950 --> 00:12:36.006
On the one hand, a set of highly paid,
highly educated professionals

00:12:36.030 --> 00:12:37.446
doing interesting work,

00:12:37.470 --> 00:12:40.886
on the other, a large number
of citizens in low-paid jobs

00:12:40.910 --> 00:12:46.566
whose primary responsibility is to see
to the comfort and health of the affluent.

00:12:46.590 --> 00:12:48.926
That is not my vision of progress,

00:12:48.950 --> 00:12:50.830
and I doubt that it is yours.

00:12:51.590 --> 00:12:53.606
But here is some encouraging news.

00:12:53.630 --> 00:12:58.486
We have faced equally momentous
economic transformations in the past,

00:12:58.510 --> 00:13:01.206
and we have come
through them successfully.

00:13:01.230 --> 00:13:06.166
In the late 1800s and early 1900s,

00:13:06.190 --> 00:13:10.726
when automation was eliminating
vast numbers of agricultural jobs --

00:13:10.750 --> 00:13:13.086
remember that tractor? --

00:13:13.110 --> 00:13:15.806
the farm states faced a threat
of mass unemployment,

00:13:15.830 --> 00:13:19.646
a generation of youth
no longer needed on the farm

00:13:19.670 --> 00:13:21.430
but not prepared for industry.

00:13:22.230 --> 00:13:23.806
Rising to this challenge,

00:13:23.830 --> 00:13:25.326
they took the radical step

00:13:25.350 --> 00:13:28.166
of requiring that
their entire youth population

00:13:28.190 --> 00:13:31.046
remain in school
and continue their education

00:13:31.070 --> 00:13:33.190
to the ripe old age of 16.

00:13:33.750 --> 00:13:35.726
This was called the high school movement,

00:13:35.750 --> 00:13:38.566
and it was a radically
expensive thing to do.

00:13:38.590 --> 00:13:40.846
Not only did they have
to invest in the schools,

00:13:40.870 --> 00:13:43.566
but those kids couldn't work
at their jobs.

00:13:43.590 --> 00:13:46.886
It also turned out to be
one of the best investments

00:13:46.910 --> 00:13:49.126
the US made in the 20th century.

00:13:49.150 --> 00:13:51.486
It gave us the most skilled,
the most flexible

00:13:51.510 --> 00:13:54.206
and the most productive
workforce in the world.

00:13:54.230 --> 00:13:58.766
To see how well this worked,
imagine taking the labor force of 1899

00:13:58.790 --> 00:14:01.006
and bringing them into the present.

00:14:01.030 --> 00:14:03.966
Despite their strong backs
and good characters,

00:14:03.990 --> 00:14:07.766
many of them would lack
the basic literacy and numeracy skills

00:14:07.790 --> 00:14:10.726
to do all but the most mundane jobs.

00:14:10.750 --> 00:14:12.990
Many of them would be unemployable.

00:14:13.990 --> 00:14:17.726
What this example highlights
is the primacy of our institutions,

00:14:17.750 --> 00:14:19.526
most especially our schools,

00:14:19.550 --> 00:14:22.086
in allowing us to reap the harvest

00:14:22.110 --> 00:14:24.406
of our technological prosperity.

00:14:24.430 --> 00:14:26.846
It's foolish to say
there's nothing to worry about.

00:14:26.870 --> 00:14:29.070
Clearly we can get this wrong.

00:14:29.790 --> 00:14:33.286
If the US had not invested
in its schools and in its skills

00:14:33.310 --> 00:14:35.566
a century ago with
the high school movement,

00:14:35.590 --> 00:14:37.246
we would be a less prosperous,

00:14:37.270 --> 00:14:40.886
a less mobile and probably
a lot less happy society.

00:14:40.910 --> 00:14:43.646
But it's equally foolish
to say that our fates are sealed.

00:14:43.670 --> 00:14:45.366
That's not decided by the machines.

00:14:45.390 --> 00:14:47.126
It's not even decided by the market.

00:14:47.150 --> 00:14:49.790
It's decided by us
and by our institutions.

00:14:50.510 --> 00:14:53.086
Now, I started this talk with a paradox.

00:14:53.110 --> 00:14:55.766
Our machines increasingly
do our work for us.

00:14:55.790 --> 00:14:58.046
Why doesn't that make
our labor superfluous,

00:14:58.070 --> 00:14:59.286
our skills redundant?

00:14:59.310 --> 00:15:02.726
Isn't it obvious that the road
to our economic and social hell

00:15:02.750 --> 00:15:04.950
is paved with our own great inventions?

00:15:06.190 --> 00:15:10.366
History has repeatedly offered
an answer to that paradox.

00:15:10.390 --> 00:15:14.006
The first part of the answer
is that technology magnifies our leverage,

00:15:14.030 --> 00:15:16.646
increases the importance, the added value

00:15:16.670 --> 00:15:20.206
of our expertise,
our judgment and our creativity.

00:15:20.230 --> 00:15:21.430
That's the O-ring.

00:15:22.030 --> 00:15:24.766
The second part of the answer
is our endless inventiveness

00:15:24.790 --> 00:15:26.246
and bottomless desires

00:15:26.270 --> 00:15:28.606
means that we never get enough,
never get enough.

00:15:28.630 --> 00:15:30.790
There's always new work to do.

00:15:32.110 --> 00:15:35.446
Adjusting to the rapid pace
of technological change

00:15:35.470 --> 00:15:36.926
creates real challenges,

00:15:36.950 --> 00:15:39.926
seen most clearly
in our polarized labor market

00:15:39.950 --> 00:15:42.470
and the threat that it poses
to economic mobility.

00:15:43.470 --> 00:15:45.910
Rising to this challenge is not automatic.

00:15:46.550 --> 00:15:48.046
It's not costless.

00:15:48.070 --> 00:15:49.486
It's not easy.

00:15:49.510 --> 00:15:50.710
But it is feasible.

00:15:51.270 --> 00:15:53.086
And here is some encouraging news.

00:15:53.110 --> 00:15:55.246
Because of our amazing productivity,

00:15:55.270 --> 00:15:56.526
we're rich.

00:15:56.550 --> 00:15:59.686
Of course we can afford
to invest in ourselves and in our children

00:15:59.710 --> 00:16:03.046
as America did a hundred years ago
with the high school movement.

00:16:03.070 --> 00:16:05.350
Arguably, we can't afford not to.

00:16:06.270 --> 00:16:08.046
Now, you may be thinking,

00:16:08.070 --> 00:16:10.926
Professor Autor has told us
a heartwarming tale

00:16:10.950 --> 00:16:12.726
about the distant past,

00:16:12.750 --> 00:16:14.126
the recent past,

00:16:14.150 --> 00:16:17.446
maybe the present,
but probably not the future.

00:16:17.470 --> 00:16:21.406
Because everybody knows
that this time is different.

00:16:21.430 --> 00:16:24.246
Right? Is this time different?

00:16:24.270 --> 00:16:26.166
Of course this time is different.

00:16:26.190 --> 00:16:27.886
Every time is different.

00:16:27.910 --> 00:16:31.526
On numerous occasions
in the last 200 years,

00:16:31.550 --> 00:16:34.326
scholars and activists
have raised the alarm

00:16:34.350 --> 00:16:37.886
that we are running out of work
and making ourselves obsolete:

00:16:37.910 --> 00:16:42.526
for example, the Luddites
in the early 1800s;

00:16:42.550 --> 00:16:45.486
US Secretary of Labor James Davis

00:16:45.510 --> 00:16:47.926
in the mid-1920s;

00:16:47.950 --> 00:16:53.126
Nobel Prize-winning economist
Wassily Leontief in 1982;

00:16:53.150 --> 00:16:56.406
and of course, many scholars,

00:16:56.430 --> 00:16:58.566
pundits, technologists

00:16:58.590 --> 00:17:00.430
and media figures today.

00:17:01.750 --> 00:17:05.070
These predictions strike me as arrogant.

00:17:05.950 --> 00:17:08.646
These self-proclaimed oracles
are in effect saying,

00:17:08.670 --> 00:17:12.086
"If I can't think of what people
will do for work in the future,

00:17:12.110 --> 00:17:15.006
then you, me and our kids

00:17:15.030 --> 00:17:16.745
aren't going to think of it either."

00:17:17.910 --> 00:17:19.845
I don't have the guts

00:17:19.870 --> 00:17:23.046
to take that bet against human ingenuity.

00:17:23.070 --> 00:17:26.046
Look, I can't tell you
what people are going to do for work

00:17:26.070 --> 00:17:27.966
a hundred years from now.

00:17:27.989 --> 00:17:30.590
But the future doesn't hinge
on my imagination.

00:17:31.430 --> 00:17:35.206
If I were a farmer in Iowa
in the year 1900,

00:17:35.229 --> 00:17:38.766
and an economist from the 21st century
teleported down to my field

00:17:38.790 --> 00:17:41.310
and said, "Hey, guess what, farmer Autor,

00:17:42.150 --> 00:17:43.686
in the next hundred years,

00:17:43.710 --> 00:17:47.486
agricultural employment is going to fall
from 40 percent of all jobs

00:17:47.510 --> 00:17:48.726
to two percent

00:17:48.750 --> 00:17:50.750
purely due to rising productivity.

00:17:51.550 --> 00:17:54.710
What do you think the other
38 percent of workers are going to do?"

00:17:55.550 --> 00:17:58.366
I would not have said, "Oh, we got this.

00:17:58.390 --> 00:18:01.246
We'll do app development,
radiological medicine,

00:18:01.270 --> 00:18:04.246
yoga instruction, Bitmoji."

00:18:04.270 --> 00:18:05.806
(Laughter)

00:18:05.830 --> 00:18:07.116
I wouldn't have had a clue.

00:18:07.990 --> 00:18:10.486
But I hope I would have had
the wisdom to say,

00:18:10.510 --> 00:18:14.526
"Wow, a 95 percent reduction
in farm employment

00:18:14.550 --> 00:18:16.686
with no shortage of food.

00:18:16.710 --> 00:18:19.126
That's an amazing amount of progress.

00:18:19.150 --> 00:18:22.526
I hope that humanity
finds something remarkable to do

00:18:22.550 --> 00:18:24.430
with all of that prosperity."

00:18:25.270 --> 00:18:28.350
And by and large, I would say that it has.

00:18:30.110 --> 00:18:31.366
Thank you very much.

00:18:31.390 --> 00:18:36.445
(Applause)
