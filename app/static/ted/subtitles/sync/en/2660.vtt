00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:15.885
Let's imagine a sculptor
building a statue,

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:18.286
just chipping away with his chisel.

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:21.366
Michelangelo had this elegant way
of describing it when he said,

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.286
"Every block of stone
has a statue inside of it,

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:27.406
and it's the task
of the sculptor to discover it."

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:29.846
But what if he worked
in the opposite direction?

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:31.726
Not from a solid block of stone,

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:33.446
but from a pile of dust,

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:37.846
somehow gluing millions of these particles
together to form a statue.

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:39.366
I know that's an absurd notion.

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.126
It's probably impossible.

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:44.086
The only way you get
a statue from a pile of dust

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:46.446
is if the statue built itself --

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:50.606
if somehow we could compel millions
of these particles to come together

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:51.910
to form the statue.

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:54.006
Now, as odd as that sounds,

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:58.166
that is almost exactly the problem
I work on in my lab.

00:00:58.190 --> 00:00:59.606
I don't build with stone,

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:01.006
I build with nanomaterials.

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:05.406
They're these just impossibly small,
fascinating little objects.

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.726
They're so small that if this controller
was a nanoparticle,

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:11.686
a human hair would be the size
of this entire room.

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:14.526
And they're at the heart of a field
we call nanotechnology,

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:16.365
which I'm sure we've all heard about,

00:01:16.389 --> 00:01:19.846
and we've all heard
how it is going to change everything.

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:21.366
When I was a graduate student,

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.726
it was one of the most exciting times
to be working in nanotechnology.

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.966
There were scientific breakthroughs
happening all the time.

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:29.406
The conferences were buzzing,

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:32.110
there was tons of money
pouring in from funding agencies.

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:34.166
And the reason is

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:36.006
when objects get really small,

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:39.646
they're governed by a different set
of physics that govern ordinary objects,

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:41.166
like the ones we interact with.

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:43.126
We call this physics quantum mechanics.

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:46.326
And what it tells you is
that you can precisely tune their behavior

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.646
just by making seemingly
small changes to them,

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:51.286
like adding or removing
a handful of atoms,

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:53.006
or twisting the material.

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:54.806
It's like this ultimate toolkit.

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:57.926
You really felt empowered;
you felt like you could make anything.

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:59.206
And we were doing it --

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:02.326
and by we I mean my whole
generation of graduate students.

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:05.846
We were trying to make blazing fast
computers using nanomaterials.

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:07.486
We were constructing quantum dots

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:10.886
that could one day go in your body
and find and fight disease.

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:13.926
There were even groups
trying to make an elevator to space

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:15.190
using carbon nanotubes.

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:18.150
You can look that up, that's true.

00:02:18.926 --> 00:02:20.926
Anyways, we thought it was going to affect

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:24.046
all parts of science and technology,
from computing to medicine.

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:25.326
And I have to admit,

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:27.326
I drank all of the Kool-Aid.

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:29.990
I mean, every last drop.

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:32.470
But that was 15 years ago,

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:34.526
and --

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:36.926
fantastic science was done,
really important work.

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:38.206
We've learned a lot.

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:42.606
We were never able to translate
that science into new technologies --

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:45.406
into technologies
that could actually impact people.

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:47.646
And the reason is, these nanomaterials --

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:49.326
they're like a double-edged sword.

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:51.606
The same thing that makes
them so interesting --

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:52.926
their small size --

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:55.246
also makes them impossible to work with.

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:59.006
It's literally like trying to build
a statue out of a pile of dust.

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:02.726
And we just don't have the tools
that are small enough to work with them.

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:05.046
But even if we did,
it wouldn't really matter,

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:08.966
because we couldn't one by one
place millions of particles together

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:10.350
to build a technology.

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:12.126
So because of that,

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:14.246
all of the promise
and all of the excitement

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:17.046
has remained just that:
promise and excitement.

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:19.446
We don't have any
disease-fighting nanobots,

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:21.526
there's no elevators to space,

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:25.246
and the thing that I'm most interested in,
no new types of computing.

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:27.806
Now that last one,
that's a really important one.

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:29.166
We just have come to expect

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:32.966
the pace of computing advancements
to go on indefinitely.

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:35.566
We've built entire economies on this idea.

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:37.326
And this pace exists

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:39.806
because of our ability
to pack more and more devices

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:41.526
onto a computer chip.

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:43.366
And as those devices get smaller,

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:45.646
they get faster, they consume less power

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:47.086
and they get cheaper.

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:51.686
And it's this convergence
that gives us this incredible pace.

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:52.926
As an example:

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:58.366
if I took the room-sized computer
that sent three men to the moon and back

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:00.526
and somehow compressed it --

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:03.806
compressed the world's
greatest computer of its day,

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:06.406
so it was the same size
as your smartphone --

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:07.686
your actual smartphone,

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:11.086
that thing you spent 300 bucks on
and just toss out every two years,

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:13.566
would blow this thing away.

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:14.926
You would not be impressed.

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:17.446
It couldn't do anything
that your smartphone does.

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:18.966
It would be slow,

00:04:18.990 --> 00:04:21.166
you couldn't put any of your stuff on it,

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:23.646
you could possibly
get through the first two minutes

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:25.846
of a "Walking Dead" episode
if you're lucky --

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:26.886
(Laughter)

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:29.085
The point is the progress --
it's not gradual.

00:04:29.109 --> 00:04:30.806
The progress is relentless.

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:32.085
It's exponential.

00:04:32.109 --> 00:04:34.446
It compounds on itself year after year,

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:36.646
to the point where
if you compare a technology

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:38.366
from one generation to the next,

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:40.366
they're almost unrecognizable.

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:43.006
And we owe it to ourselves
to keep this progress going.

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:46.646
We want to say the same thing
10, 20, 30 years from now:

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:48.750
look what we've done
over the last 30 years.

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:52.086
Yet we know this progress
may not last forever.

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:54.166
In fact, the party's kind of winding down.

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:56.526
It's like "last call for alcohol," right?

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:58.206
If you look under the covers,

00:04:58.230 --> 00:05:00.806
by many metrics
like speed and performance,

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:03.350
the progress has already slowed to a halt.

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:06.046
So if we want to keep this party going,

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:08.326
we have to do what we've
always been able to do,

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:09.806
and that is to innovate.

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:12.406
So our group's role
and our group's mission

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:14.846
is to innovate
by employing carbon nanotubes,

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:18.926
because we think that they can
provide a path to continue this pace.

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:20.406
They are just like they sound.

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:22.886
They're tiny, hollow tubes
of carbon atoms,

00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:25.846
and their nanoscale size,
that small size,

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:29.526
gives rise to these
just outstanding electronic properties.

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:33.206
And the science tells us
if we could employ them in computing,

00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:35.966
we could see up to a ten times
improvement in performance.

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:40.390
It's like skipping through several
technology generations in just one step.

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:42.246
So there we have it.

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:44.286
We have this really important problem

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:46.686
and we have what is basically
the ideal solution.

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:48.366
The science is screaming at us,

00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:51.230
"This is what you should be doing
to solve your problem."

00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:55.246
So, all right, let's get started,

00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:56.526
let's do this.

00:05:56.550 --> 00:05:59.246
But you just run right back
into that double-edged sword.

00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:02.846
This "ideal solution" contains a material
that's impossible to work with.

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:07.166
I'd have to arrange billions of them
just to make one single computer chip.

00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:10.790
It's that same conundrum,
it's like this undying problem.

00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:13.486
At this point, we said, "Let's just stop.

00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:15.446
Let's not go down that same road.

00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:18.006
Let's just figure out what's missing.

00:06:18.030 --> 00:06:19.446
What are we not dealing with?

00:06:19.470 --> 00:06:21.606
What are we not doing
that needs to be done?"

00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:23.406
It's like in "The Godfather," right?

00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:25.726
When Fredo betrays his brother Michael,

00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:27.406
we all know what needs to be done.

00:06:27.430 --> 00:06:28.766
Fredo's got to go.

00:06:28.790 --> 00:06:29.806
(Laughter)

00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:31.766
But Michael -- he puts it off.

00:06:31.790 --> 00:06:33.006
Fine, I get it.

00:06:33.030 --> 00:06:35.486
Their mother's still alive,
it would make her upset.

00:06:35.510 --> 00:06:36.926
We just said,

00:06:36.950 --> 00:06:39.246
"What's the Fredo in our problem?"

00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:40.686
What are we not dealing with?

00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:42.246
What are we not doing,

00:06:42.270 --> 00:06:44.790
but needs to be done
to make this a success?"

00:06:45.350 --> 00:06:49.406
And the answer is
that the statue has to build itself.

00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:51.366
We have to find a way, somehow,

00:06:51.390 --> 00:06:55.486
to compel, to convince
billions of these particles

00:06:55.510 --> 00:06:58.486
to assemble themselves
into the technology.

00:06:58.510 --> 00:07:01.686
We can't do it for them.
They have to do it for themselves.

00:07:01.710 --> 00:07:04.846
And it's the hard way,
and this is not trivial,

00:07:04.870 --> 00:07:07.726
but in this case, it's the only way.

00:07:07.750 --> 00:07:11.646
Now, as it turns out,
this is not that alien of a problem.

00:07:11.670 --> 00:07:13.526
We just don't build anything this way.

00:07:13.550 --> 00:07:15.566
People don't build anything this way.

00:07:15.590 --> 00:07:18.766
But if you look around --
and there's examples everywhere --

00:07:18.790 --> 00:07:21.686
Mother Nature builds everything this way.

00:07:21.710 --> 00:07:24.366
Everything is built from the bottom up.

00:07:24.390 --> 00:07:25.646
You can go to the beach,

00:07:25.670 --> 00:07:28.846
you'll find these simple organisms
that use proteins --

00:07:28.870 --> 00:07:30.126
basically molecules --

00:07:30.150 --> 00:07:32.206
to template what is essentially sand,

00:07:32.230 --> 00:07:33.646
just plucking it from the sea

00:07:33.670 --> 00:07:37.046
and building these extraordinary
architectures with extreme diversity.

00:07:37.070 --> 00:07:39.686
And nature's not crude like us,
just hacking away.

00:07:39.710 --> 00:07:41.406
She's elegant and smart,

00:07:41.430 --> 00:07:44.166
building with what's available,
molecule by molecule,

00:07:44.190 --> 00:07:46.326
making structures with a complexity

00:07:46.350 --> 00:07:48.630
and a diversity
that we can't even approach.

00:07:49.470 --> 00:07:51.166
And she's already at the nano.

00:07:51.190 --> 00:07:53.686
She's been there
for hundreds of millions of years.

00:07:53.710 --> 00:07:55.750
We're the ones that are late to the party.

00:07:56.270 --> 00:08:00.446
So we decided that we're going
to use the same tool that nature uses,

00:08:00.470 --> 00:08:01.710
and that's chemistry.

00:08:02.150 --> 00:08:03.606
Chemistry is the missing tool.

00:08:03.630 --> 00:08:05.686
And chemistry works in this case

00:08:05.710 --> 00:08:09.526
because these nanoscale objects
are about the same size as molecules,

00:08:09.550 --> 00:08:12.166
so we can use them
to steer these objects around,

00:08:12.190 --> 00:08:13.390
much like a tool.

00:08:13.910 --> 00:08:15.966
That's exactly what we've done in our lab.

00:08:15.990 --> 00:08:19.166
We've developed chemistry
that goes into the pile of dust,

00:08:19.190 --> 00:08:20.686
into the pile of nanoparticles,

00:08:20.710 --> 00:08:23.086
and pulls out exactly the ones we need.

00:08:23.110 --> 00:08:26.726
Then we can use chemistry to arrange
literally billions of these particles

00:08:26.750 --> 00:08:29.606
into the pattern
we need to build circuits.

00:08:29.630 --> 00:08:30.966
And because we can do that,

00:08:30.990 --> 00:08:33.366
we can build circuits
that are many times faster

00:08:33.390 --> 00:08:36.606
than what anyone's been able
to make using nanomaterials before.

00:08:36.630 --> 00:08:38.046
Chemistry's the missing tool,

00:08:38.070 --> 00:08:41.686
and every day our tool gets sharper
and gets more precise.

00:08:41.710 --> 00:08:42.926
And eventually --

00:08:42.950 --> 00:08:45.566
and we hope this is
within a handful of years --

00:08:45.590 --> 00:08:48.966
we can deliver on one
of those original promises.

00:08:48.990 --> 00:08:51.045
Now, computing is just one example.

00:08:51.069 --> 00:08:54.606
It's the one that I'm interested in,
that my group is really invested in,

00:08:54.630 --> 00:08:58.446
but there are others
in renewable energy, in medicine,

00:08:58.470 --> 00:09:00.206
in structural materials,

00:09:00.230 --> 00:09:03.286
where the science is going to tell you
to move towards the nano.

00:09:03.310 --> 00:09:05.430
That's where the biggest benefit is.

00:09:06.070 --> 00:09:07.526
But if we're going to do that,

00:09:07.550 --> 00:09:10.726
the scientists of today and tomorrow
are going to need new tools --

00:09:10.750 --> 00:09:12.886
tools just like the ones I described.

00:09:12.910 --> 00:09:16.766
And they will need chemistry.
That's the point.

00:09:16.790 --> 00:09:20.446
The beauty of science is that
once you develop these new tools,

00:09:20.470 --> 00:09:21.726
they're out there.

00:09:21.750 --> 00:09:23.006
They're out there forever,

00:09:23.030 --> 00:09:25.886
and anyone anywhere
can pick them up and use them,

00:09:25.910 --> 00:09:28.870
and help to deliver
on the promise of nanotechnology.

00:09:29.470 --> 00:09:32.166
Thank you so much for your time.
I appreciate it.

00:09:32.190 --> 00:09:34.630
