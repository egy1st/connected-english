00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.606
[This talk contains graphic language
and descriptions of sexual violence]

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:17.059
[Viewer discretion is advised]

00:00:17.083 --> 00:00:20.083
"Ashley Judd, stupid fucking slut.

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:24.470
"You can't sue someone
for calling them a cunt."

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:27.870
"If you can't handle the Internet,
fuck off, whore."

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:31.846
"I wish Ashley Judd
would die a horrible death.

00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:34.246
She is the absolute worst."

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:37.470
"Ashley Judd, you're the reason
women shouldn't vote."

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.726
"'Twisted' is such a bad movie,

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:42.470
I don't even want to rape it."

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:45.886
"Whatever you do,

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:49.070
don't tell Ashley Judd.
She'll die alone with a dried out vagina."

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:53.086
"If I had to fuck an older woman,

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:54.366
oh my God,

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.566
I would fuck the shit out of Ashley Judd,

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:59.846
that bitch is hot af.

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:02.710
The unforgivable shit I would do to her."

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:10.630
Online misogyny is a global
gender rights tragedy,

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.206
and it is imperative that it ends.

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:17.430
(Applause)

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.566
Girls' and women's voices,

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:28.406
and our allies' voices
are constrained in ways

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:30.446
that are personally, economically,

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:33.086
professionally and politically damaging.

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:35.110
And when we curb abuse,

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.870
we will expand freedom.

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:41.166
I am a Kentucky basketball fan,

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:43.246
so on a fine March day last year,

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:45.846
I was doing one of the things I do best:

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:47.806
I was cheering for my Wildcats.

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:49.206
The daffodils were blooming,

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:52.686
but the referees were not blowing
the whistle when I was telling them to.

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:53.966
(Laughter)

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:56.726
Funny, they're very friendly
to me before the opening tip,

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:58.806
but they really ignore me during the game.

00:01:58.830 --> 00:01:59.846
(Laughter)

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:03.326
Three of my players were bleeding,
so I did the next best thing ...

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:04.566
I tweeted.

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.766
[@ArkRazorback dirty play can kiss
my team's free throw making a --

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:10.726
@KySportsRadio @marchmadness
@espn Bloodied 3 players so far.]

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:14.406
It is routine for me to be treated
in the ways I've already described to you.

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:16.046
It happens to me every single day

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:18.686
on social media platforms
such as Twitter and Facebook.

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:21.086
Since I joined Twitter in 2011,

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:25.126
misogyny and misogynists
have amply demonstrated

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:27.126
they will dog my every step.

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:29.526
My spirituality, my faith,

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:31.836
being a hillbilly --
I can say that, you can't --

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:34.020
all of it is fair game.

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:38.206
And I have responded to this
with various strategies.

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:39.566
I've tried engaging people.

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:44.206
This one guy was sending me
hypersexual, nasty stuff,

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:46.886
and there was a girl in his avatar.

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:48.590
I wrote him back and said ...

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:51.150
"Is that your daughter?

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:54.366
I feel a lot of fear
that you may think about

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:56.046
and talk to women this way."

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:57.526
And he surprised me by saying,

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:59.966
"You know what?
You're right. I apologize."

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:02.430
Sometimes people
want to be held accountable.

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:06.206
This one guy was musing
to I don't know who

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:08.270
that maybe I was the definition of a cunt.

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:10.926
I was married to a Scot for 14 years,

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:14.526
so I said, "Cunt means many
different things in different countries --

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:15.766
(Laughter)

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:18.886
but I'm pretty sure you epitomize
the global standard of a dick."

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:20.126
(Laughter)

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:22.310
(Applause)

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:27.646
I've tried to rise above it,
I've tried to get in the trenches,

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:30.606
but mostly I would scroll through
these social media platforms

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:33.246
with one eye partially closed,
trying not to see it,

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:35.510
but you can't make
a cucumber out of a pickle.

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:37.886
What is seen goes in.

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:39.110
It's traumatic.

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:42.246
And I was always secretly hoping
in some part of me

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:44.910
that what was being said to me
and about me wasn't ...

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:47.590
true.

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:51.286
Because even I,

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:54.470
an avowed, self-declared feminist,

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:57.470
who worships at the altar of Gloria --

00:03:58.150 --> 00:03:59.590
(Laughter)

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:02.270
internalize the patriarchy.

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:04.686
This is really critical.

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:07.486
Patriarchy is not boys and men.

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:10.246
It is a system
in which we all participate,

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:11.470
including me.

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:16.566
On that particular day, for some reason,

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:19.126
that particular tweet
after the basketball game

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:21.726
triggered something called a "cyber mob."

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:27.766
This vitriolic, global outpouring
of the most heinous hate speech:

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:29.726
death threats, rape threats.

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:30.965
And don't you know,

00:04:30.989 --> 00:04:33.326
when I was sitting at home
alone in my nightgown,

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:36.046
I got a phone call,
and it was my beloved former husband,

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:37.406
and he said on a voice mail,

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:38.630
"Loved one ...

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:42.150
what is happening to you is not OK."

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:48.430
And there was something about him
taking a stand for me that night ...

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:52.846
that allowed me
to take a stand for myself.

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:54.110
And I started to write.

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:57.526
I started to write about sharing the fact

00:04:57.550 --> 00:04:59.886
that I'm a survivor
of all forms of sexual abuse,

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:01.326
including three rapes.

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:03.606
And the hate speech
I get in response to that --

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:07.030
these are just some of the comments
posted to news outlets.

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:10.990
Being told I'm a "snitch" is really fun.

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:15.206
[Jay: She enjoyed every second of it!!!!!]

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:16.446
Audience: Oh, Lord Jesus.

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:20.286
Ashley Judd: Thank you, Jesus.
May your grace and mercy shine.

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:22.990
So, I wrote this feminist op-ed,
it is entitled,

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:26.406
"Forget Your Team:

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:29.246
It Is Your Online Gender Violence
Toward Girls And Women

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:31.766
That Can Kiss My Righteous Ass."

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:33.326
(Laughter)

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:35.350
(Applause)

00:05:36.615 --> 00:05:38.806
And I did that alone,
and I published it alone,

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:40.286
because my chief advisor said,

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:41.526
"Please don't,

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:44.326
the rain of retaliatory garbage
that is inevitable --

00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:45.766
I fear for you."

00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:47.886
But I trust girls and I trust women,

00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:49.486
and I trust our allies.

00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:51.166
It was published, it went viral,

00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:53.286
it proves that every single day

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:56.806
online misogyny is a phenomenon
endured by us all,

00:05:56.830 --> 00:05:58.046
all over the world,

00:05:58.070 --> 00:05:59.806
and when it is intersectional,

00:05:59.830 --> 00:06:01.046
it is worse.

00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:03.006
Sexual orientation, gender identity,

00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:04.846
race, ethnicity, religion --

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:06.086
you name it,

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:08.646
it amplifies the violence
endured by girls and women,

00:06:08.670 --> 00:06:10.910
and for our younger girls, it is worse.

00:06:13.230 --> 00:06:14.966
It's clearly traumatizing.

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:18.166
Our mental health,
our emotional well-being

00:06:18.190 --> 00:06:19.646
are so gravely affected

00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:21.126
because the threat of violence

00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:25.366
is experienced
neurobiologically as violence.

00:06:25.390 --> 00:06:28.446
The cortisol shoots up,
the limbic system gets fired,

00:06:28.470 --> 00:06:30.550
we lose productivity at work.

00:06:32.070 --> 00:06:33.806
And let's talk about work.

00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:36.750
Our ability to work is constrained.

00:06:37.350 --> 00:06:42.046
Online searches of women applying for jobs
reveal nude pictures of them,

00:06:42.070 --> 00:06:44.656
false allegations they have STDs,

00:06:44.910 --> 00:06:50.126
their addresses indicating
that they are available for sex

00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:51.686
with real examples

00:06:51.710 --> 00:06:55.350
of people showing up
at this house for said sex.

00:06:56.230 --> 00:07:00.550
Our ability to go to school is impaired.

00:07:01.270 --> 00:07:03.686
96 percent of all postings

00:07:03.710 --> 00:07:06.830
of sexual images of our young people ...

00:07:07.710 --> 00:07:09.166
girls.

00:07:09.190 --> 00:07:10.390
Our girls.

00:07:10.830 --> 00:07:14.686
Our boys are two to three
times more likely --

00:07:14.710 --> 00:07:16.070
nonconsensually --

00:07:16.710 --> 00:07:18.510
to share images.

00:07:19.750 --> 00:07:21.830
And I want to say a word
about revenge porn.

00:07:22.550 --> 00:07:24.806
Part of what came out of this tweet

00:07:24.830 --> 00:07:27.646
was my getting connected
with allies and other activists

00:07:27.670 --> 00:07:30.270
who are fighting
for a safe and free internet.

00:07:31.030 --> 00:07:33.566
We started something
called the Speech Project;

00:07:33.590 --> 00:07:36.086
curbing abuse, expanding freedom.

00:07:36.110 --> 00:07:38.790
And that website
provides a critical forum,

00:07:39.430 --> 00:07:43.230
because there is no global, legal thing

00:07:43.990 --> 00:07:45.486
to help us figure this out.

00:07:45.510 --> 00:07:49.126
But we do provide on that website
a standardized list of definitions,

00:07:49.150 --> 00:07:52.246
because it's hard to attack
a behavior in the right way

00:07:52.270 --> 00:07:55.686
if we're not all sharing
a definition of what that behavior is.

00:07:55.710 --> 00:08:00.486
And I learned that revenge porn
is often dangerously misapplied.

00:08:00.510 --> 00:08:03.230
It is the nonconsensual
sharing of an image

00:08:03.830 --> 00:08:08.286
used tactically to shame
and humiliate a girl or woman

00:08:08.310 --> 00:08:10.926
that attempts to pornography us.

00:08:10.950 --> 00:08:14.806
Our natural sexuality is --

00:08:14.830 --> 00:08:17.630
I don't know about yours --
pretty gorgeous and wonderful.

00:08:19.230 --> 00:08:21.670
And my expressing it
does not pornography make.

00:08:22.510 --> 00:08:24.270
(Applause)

00:08:28.390 --> 00:08:29.846
So, I have all these resources

00:08:29.870 --> 00:08:33.190
that I'm keenly aware
so many people in the world do not.

00:08:33.830 --> 00:08:36.790
I was able to start
the Speech Project with colleagues.

00:08:37.470 --> 00:08:39.966
I can often get a social media
company's attention.

00:08:39.990 --> 00:08:42.950
I have a wonderful visit
to Facebook HQ coming up.

00:08:45.870 --> 00:08:49.030
Hasn't helped the idiotic
reporting standards yet ...

00:08:51.030 --> 00:08:56.150
I actually pay someone
to scrub my social media feeds,

00:08:56.950 --> 00:08:59.086
attempting to spare my brain

00:08:59.110 --> 00:09:03.326
the daily iterations
of the trauma of hate speech.

00:09:03.350 --> 00:09:04.566
And guess what?

00:09:04.590 --> 00:09:05.966
I get hate speech for that.

00:09:05.990 --> 00:09:07.610
"Oh, you live in an echo chamber."

00:09:07.634 --> 00:09:08.886
Well, guess what?

00:09:08.910 --> 00:09:11.606
Having someone post a photograph
of me with my mouth open

00:09:11.630 --> 00:09:13.686
saying they "can't wait
to cum on my face,"

00:09:13.710 --> 00:09:15.470
I have a right to set that boundary.

00:09:15.990 --> 00:09:17.750
(Applause)

00:09:21.790 --> 00:09:24.886
And this distinction
between virtual and real is specious

00:09:24.910 --> 00:09:26.126
because guess what --

00:09:26.150 --> 00:09:28.646
that actually happened to me
once when I was a child,

00:09:28.670 --> 00:09:31.246
and so that tweet brought up that trauma,

00:09:31.270 --> 00:09:33.046
and I had to do work on that.

00:09:33.070 --> 00:09:36.246
But you know what we do?
We take all of this hate speech,

00:09:36.270 --> 00:09:38.150
and we disaggregate it,

00:09:38.990 --> 00:09:40.366
and we code it,

00:09:40.390 --> 00:09:42.246
and we give that data

00:09:42.270 --> 00:09:44.966
so that we understand
the intersectionality of it:

00:09:44.990 --> 00:09:46.246
when I get porn,

00:09:46.270 --> 00:09:48.126
when it's about political affiliation,

00:09:48.150 --> 00:09:50.350
when it's about age,
when it's about all of it.

00:09:51.190 --> 00:09:52.990
We're going to win this fight.

00:09:54.910 --> 00:09:56.590
There are a lot of solutions --

00:09:57.870 --> 00:09:59.070
thank goodness.

00:09:59.510 --> 00:10:01.646
I'm going to offer just a few,

00:10:01.670 --> 00:10:06.310
and of course I challenge you
to create and contribute your own.

00:10:07.510 --> 00:10:10.766
Number one: we have to start
with digital media literacy,

00:10:10.790 --> 00:10:14.326
and clearly it must have a gendered lens.

00:10:14.350 --> 00:10:16.846
Kids, schools, caregivers, parents:

00:10:16.870 --> 00:10:18.070
it's essential.

00:10:18.550 --> 00:10:19.750
Two ...

00:10:20.790 --> 00:10:22.710
shall we talk about our friends in tech?

00:10:23.790 --> 00:10:25.750
Said with dignity and respect,

00:10:26.430 --> 00:10:31.406
the sexism in your workplaces must end.

00:10:31.430 --> 00:10:33.886
(Applause)

00:10:33.910 --> 00:10:35.110
(Cheers)

00:10:35.910 --> 00:10:37.126
EDGE,

00:10:37.150 --> 00:10:40.006
the global standard for gender equality,

00:10:40.030 --> 00:10:41.566
is the minimum standard.

00:10:41.590 --> 00:10:43.806
And guess what, Silicon Valley?

00:10:43.830 --> 00:10:45.806
If L'Oréal in India,

00:10:45.830 --> 00:10:48.006
in the Philippines, in Brazil

00:10:48.030 --> 00:10:49.926
and in Russia can do it,

00:10:49.950 --> 00:10:51.990
you can, too.

00:10:52.670 --> 00:10:54.310
Enough excuses.

00:10:55.350 --> 00:10:59.126
Only when women have critical mass
in every department at your companies,

00:10:59.150 --> 00:11:01.966
including building platforms
from the ground up,

00:11:01.990 --> 00:11:06.326
will the conversations
about priorities and solutions change.

00:11:06.350 --> 00:11:08.406
And more love for my friends in tech:

00:11:08.430 --> 00:11:12.350
profiteering off misogyny
in video games must end.

00:11:12.950 --> 00:11:16.406
I'm so tired of hearing you
talk to me at cocktail parties --

00:11:16.430 --> 00:11:18.766
like you did a couple
weeks ago in Aspen --

00:11:18.790 --> 00:11:21.726
about how deplorable #Gamergate was,

00:11:21.750 --> 00:11:24.366
when you're still making
billions of dollars off games

00:11:24.390 --> 00:11:27.606
that maim and dump women for sport.

00:11:27.630 --> 00:11:30.166
Basta! -- as the Italians would say.

00:11:30.190 --> 00:11:31.446
Enough.

00:11:31.470 --> 00:11:34.190
(Applause)

00:11:35.390 --> 00:11:38.886
Our friends in law enforcement
have much to do,

00:11:38.910 --> 00:11:40.526
because we've seen

00:11:40.550 --> 00:11:44.990
that online violence
is an extension of in-person violence.

00:11:46.390 --> 00:11:48.126
In our country,

00:11:48.150 --> 00:11:52.150
more girls and women have been
murdered by their intimate partners

00:11:52.950 --> 00:11:54.726
than died on 9/11

00:11:54.750 --> 00:11:59.366
and have died since
in Afghanistan and Iraq combined.

00:11:59.390 --> 00:12:01.486
And it's not cool to say that,

00:12:01.510 --> 00:12:02.710
but it is true.

00:12:03.510 --> 00:12:07.406
We care so much geopolitically
about what men are doing over there

00:12:07.430 --> 00:12:08.630
to women over there ...

00:12:09.630 --> 00:12:11.070
In 2015,

00:12:11.990 --> 00:12:18.246
72,828 women used intimate
partner violence services in this country.

00:12:18.270 --> 00:12:21.710
That is not counting the girls
and women and boys who needed them.

00:12:23.310 --> 00:12:25.670
Law enforcement must be empowered

00:12:26.430 --> 00:12:28.646
with up-to-date internet technology,

00:12:28.670 --> 00:12:31.886
the devices and an understanding
of these platforms --

00:12:31.910 --> 00:12:33.110
how they work.

00:12:33.630 --> 00:12:36.366
The police wanted to be helpful
when Amanda Hess called

00:12:36.390 --> 00:12:38.926
about the death threat
she was getting on Twitter,

00:12:38.950 --> 00:12:41.086
but they couldn't really when they said,

00:12:41.110 --> 00:12:42.310
"What's Twitter?"

00:12:44.790 --> 00:12:48.686
Our legislators must write
and pass astute legislation

00:12:48.710 --> 00:12:50.606
that reflects today's technology

00:12:50.630 --> 00:12:53.830
and our notions of free and hate speech.

00:12:54.430 --> 00:12:58.966
In New York recently, the law
could not be applied to a perpetrator

00:12:58.990 --> 00:13:01.166
because the crimes
must have been committed --

00:13:01.190 --> 00:13:02.526
even if it was anonymous --

00:13:02.550 --> 00:13:07.006
they must have been committed
by telephone, in mail,

00:13:07.030 --> 00:13:08.446
by telegraph --

00:13:08.470 --> 00:13:09.950
(Laughter)

00:13:13.150 --> 00:13:15.590
The language must be
technologically neutral.

00:13:17.510 --> 00:13:19.326
So apparently,

00:13:19.350 --> 00:13:21.150
I've got a pretty bold voice.

00:13:21.670 --> 00:13:23.385
So, let's talk about our friends ...

00:13:24.230 --> 00:13:25.430
white men.

00:13:27.310 --> 00:13:29.910
You have a role to play
and a choice to make.

00:13:30.790 --> 00:13:32.926
You can do something,

00:13:32.950 --> 00:13:34.230
or you can do nothing.

00:13:36.430 --> 00:13:37.686
We're cool in this room,

00:13:37.710 --> 00:13:39.710
but when this goes out, everyone will say,

00:13:39.734 --> 00:13:41.454
"Oh my God, she's a reverse racist."

00:13:42.670 --> 00:13:46.246
That quote was said
by a white man, Robert Moritz,

00:13:46.270 --> 00:13:48.686
chairperson, PricewaterhouseCoopers,

00:13:48.710 --> 00:13:50.750
he asked me to include it in my talk.

00:13:53.110 --> 00:13:55.990
We need to grow support lines
and help groups,

00:13:56.630 --> 00:13:58.590
so victims can help each other

00:13:59.390 --> 00:14:02.206
when their lives and finances
have been derailed.

00:14:02.230 --> 00:14:06.606
We must as individuals disrupt
gender violence as it is happening.

00:14:06.630 --> 00:14:08.406
92 percent of young people

00:14:08.430 --> 00:14:10.230
29 and under witness it.

00:14:10.870 --> 00:14:13.350
72 percent of us have witnessed it.

00:14:14.230 --> 00:14:15.966
We must have the courage and urgency

00:14:15.990 --> 00:14:18.670
to practice stopping it
as it is unfolding.

00:14:20.390 --> 00:14:21.590
And lastly,

00:14:22.870 --> 00:14:24.070
believe her.

00:14:25.750 --> 00:14:26.966
Believe her.

00:14:26.990 --> 00:14:29.470
(Applause)

00:14:33.870 --> 00:14:37.710
This is fundamentally
a problem of human interaction.

00:14:38.710 --> 00:14:42.846
And as I believe that human interaction
is at the core of our healing,

00:14:42.870 --> 00:14:46.870
trauma not transformed
will be trauma transferred.

00:14:47.750 --> 00:14:50.846
Edith Wharton said,
"The end is latent in the beginning,"

00:14:50.870 --> 00:14:55.846
so we are going to end this talk
replacing hate speech with love speech.

00:14:55.870 --> 00:14:57.806
Because I get lonely in this,

00:14:57.830 --> 00:14:59.670
but I know that we are allies.

00:15:00.790 --> 00:15:02.446
I recently learned

00:15:02.470 --> 00:15:07.086
about how gratitude and affirmations
offset negative interactions.

00:15:07.110 --> 00:15:10.566
It takes five of those
to offset one negative interaction,

00:15:10.590 --> 00:15:12.046
and gratitude in particular --

00:15:12.070 --> 00:15:14.766
free, available globally
any time, anywhere,

00:15:14.790 --> 00:15:16.886
to anyone in any dialect --

00:15:16.910 --> 00:15:20.126
it fires the pregenual anterior cingulate,

00:15:20.150 --> 00:15:21.966
a watershed part of the brain

00:15:21.990 --> 00:15:24.606
that floods it with great, good stuff.

00:15:24.630 --> 00:15:27.246
So I'm going to say
awesome stuff about myself.

00:15:27.270 --> 00:15:29.606
I would like for you
to reflect it back to me.

00:15:29.630 --> 00:15:31.766
It might sound something like this --

00:15:31.790 --> 00:15:33.246
(Laughter)

00:15:33.270 --> 00:15:37.286
I am a powerful and strong woman,
and you would say, "Yes, you are."

00:15:37.310 --> 00:15:38.966
Audience: Yes, you are.

00:15:38.990 --> 00:15:40.726
Ashley Judd: My mama loves me.

00:15:40.750 --> 00:15:42.166
A: Yes, she does.

00:15:42.190 --> 00:15:44.246
AJ: I did a great job with my talk.

00:15:44.270 --> 00:15:45.886
A: Yes, you did.

00:15:45.910 --> 00:15:49.046
AJ: I have a right to be here.

00:15:49.070 --> 00:15:50.846
A: Yes, you do.

00:15:50.870 --> 00:15:52.086
AJ: I'm really cute.

00:15:52.110 --> 00:15:53.366
(Laughter)

00:15:53.390 --> 00:15:54.846
A: Yes, you are.

00:15:54.870 --> 00:15:56.606
AJ: God does good work.

00:15:56.630 --> 00:15:58.406
A: Yes, He does.

00:15:58.430 --> 00:16:00.166
AJ: And I love you.

00:16:00.190 --> 00:16:02.510
Thank you so much
for letting me be of service.

00:16:03.470 --> 00:16:04.686
Bless you.

00:16:04.710 --> 00:16:09.880
(Applause)
