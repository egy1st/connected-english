00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:14.150
A few words about how I got started,

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:18.150
and it has a lot to do with happiness, actually.

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.150
When I was a very young child, I was extremely introverted

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.150
and very much to myself.

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.150
And, kind of as a way of surviving,

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.150
I would go into my own very personal space,

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.150
and I would make things.

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:34.150
I would make things for people

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:38.150
as a way of, you know, giving, showing them my love.

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:41.150
I would go into these private places,

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:45.150
and I would put my ideas and my passions into objects --

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:48.150
and sort of learning how to speak with my hands.

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:52.150
So, the whole activity of working with my hands and creating objects

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:57.150
is very much connected with not only the idea realm,

00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:00.150
but also with very much the feeling realm.

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:05.150
And the ideas are very disparate.

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:08.150
I'm going to show you many different kinds of pieces,

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:11.150
and there's no real connection between one or the other,

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:13.150
except that they sort of come out of my brain,

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:17.150
and they're all different sort of thoughts that are triggered

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:21.150
by looking at life, and seeing nature and seeing objects,

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:25.150
and just having kind of playful random thoughts about things.

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:33.150
When I was a child, I started to explore motion.

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.150
I fell in love with the way things moved,

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:40.150
so I started to explore motion by making little flipbooks.

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:44.150
And this is one that I did, probably like when I was around seventh grade,

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:47.150
and I remember when I was doing this,

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:50.150
I was thinking about that little rock there,

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:55.150
and the pathway of the vehicles as they would fly through the air,

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:57.150
and how the characters --

00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:58.150
(Laughter) --

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:00.150
would come shooting out of the car,

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:07.150
so, on my mind, I was thinking about the trajectory of the vehicles.

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:10.150
And of course, when you're a little kid, there's always destruction.

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:12.150
So, it has to end with this --

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:13.150
(Laughter) --

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:15.150
gratuitous violence.

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:17.150
(Laughter)

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:23.150
So that was how I first started to explore the way things moved,

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:25.150
and expressed it.

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:27.150
Now, when I went to college,

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:34.150
I found myself making fairly complicated, fragile machines.

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:37.150
And this really came about

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:40.150
from having many different kinds of interests.

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:43.150
When I was in high school, I loved to program computers,

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:47.150
so I sort of liked the logical flow of events.

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:53.150
I was also very interested in perhaps going into surgery

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:55.150
and becoming a surgeon,

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:57.150
because it meant working with my hands

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:00.150
in a very focused, intense way.

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:02.150
So, I started taking art courses,

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:05.150
and I found a way to make sculpture

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:09.150
that brought together my love for being very precise with my hands,

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:19.150
with coming up with different kinds of logical flows of energy through a system.

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:25.150
And also, working with wire -- everything that I did

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:31.150
was both a visual and a mechanical engineering decision

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:33.150
at the same time.

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:35.150
So, I was able to sort of exercise all of that.

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:41.150
Now, this kind of machine is as close as I can get to painting.

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:46.150
And it's full of many little trivial end points,

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:51.150
like there's a little foot here that just drags around in circles

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:53.150
and it doesn't really mean anything.

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:58.150
It's really just for the sort of joy of its own triviality.

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:02.150
The connection I have with engineering

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:07.150
is the same as any other engineer, in that I love to solve problems.

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:09.150
I love to figure things out,

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:14.150
but the end result of what I'm doing is really completely ambiguous.

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:17.150
(Laughter)

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:19.150
That's pretty ambiguous.

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:20.150
(Laughter)

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:26.150
The next piece that is going to come up

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:35.150
is an example of a kind of machine that is fairly complex.

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:38.150
I gave myself the problem.

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:40.150
Since I'm always liking to solve problems,

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:44.150
I gave myself the problem of turning a crank in one direction,

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:47.150
and solving all of the mechanical problems

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:50.150
for getting this little man to walk back and forth.

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:55.150
So, when I started this, I didn't have an overall plan for the machine,

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:59.150
but I did have a sense of the gesture,

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:03.150
and a sense of the shape and how it would occupy space.

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:06.150
And then it was a matter of starting from one point

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:09.150
and sort of building to that final point.

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:14.150
That little gear there switches back and forth to change direction.

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:17.150
And that's a little found object.

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:22.150
So a lot of the pieces that I've made,

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:25.150
they involve found objects.

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:34.150
And it really -- it's almost like doing visual puns all the time.

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:37.150
When I see objects, I imagine them in motion.

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:39.150
I imagine what can be said with them.

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:43.150
This next one here, "Machine with Wishbone,"

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:50.150
it came about from playing with this wishbone after dinner.

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:52.150
You know, they say, never play with your food --

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:54.150
but I always play with things.

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:56.150
So, I had this wishbone, and I thought,

00:05:56.150 --> 00:05:59.150
it's kind of like a cowboy who's been on his horse for too long.

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:00.150
(Laughter)

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:03.150
And I started to make him walk across the table,

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:06.150
and I thought, "Oh, I can make a little machine that will do that."

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:14.150
So, I made this device, linked it up, and the wishbone walks.

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:17.150
And because the wishbone is bone -- it's animal --

00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:22.150
it's sort of a point where I think we can enter into it.

00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:25.150
And that's the whole piece.

00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:26.150
(Laughter)

00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:29.150
That's about that big.

00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:33.150
(Applause)

00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:39.150
This kind of work is also very much like puppetry,

00:06:39.150 --> 00:06:43.150
where the found object is, in a sense, the puppet,

00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:48.150
and I'm the puppeteer at first, because I'm playing with an object.

00:06:48.150 --> 00:06:52.150
But then I make the machine, which is sort of the stand-in for me,

00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:55.150
and it is able to achieve the action that I want.

00:06:57.150 --> 00:07:04.150
The next piece I'll show you is a much more conceptual thought,

00:07:04.150 --> 00:07:07.150
and it's a little piece called "Cory's Yellow Chair."

00:07:08.150 --> 00:07:13.150
I had this image in my mind, when I saw my son's little chair,

00:07:13.150 --> 00:07:17.150
and I saw it explode up and out.

00:07:18.150 --> 00:07:20.150
And --

00:07:22.150 --> 00:07:25.150
so the way I saw this in my mind at first,

00:07:25.150 --> 00:07:29.150
was that the pieces would explode up and out with infinite speed,

00:07:29.150 --> 00:07:31.150
and the pieces would move far out,

00:07:31.150 --> 00:07:33.150
and then they would begin to be pulled back

00:07:33.150 --> 00:07:35.150
with a kind of a gravitational feel,

00:07:35.150 --> 00:07:39.150
to the point where they would approach infinite speed back to the center.

00:07:39.150 --> 00:07:42.150
And they would coalesce for just a moment,

00:07:42.150 --> 00:07:45.150
so you could perceive that there was a chair there.

00:07:45.150 --> 00:07:51.150
For me, it's kind of a feeling about the fleetingness of the present moment,

00:07:51.150 --> 00:07:53.150
and I wanted to express that.

00:07:53.150 --> 00:07:58.150
Now, the machine is -- in this case, it's a real approximation of that,

00:07:58.150 --> 00:08:01.150
because obviously you can't move physical matter

00:08:01.150 --> 00:08:05.150
infinitely with infinite speed and have it stop instantaneously.

00:08:05.150 --> 00:08:09.150
This whole thing is about four feet wide,

00:08:09.150 --> 00:08:12.150
and the chair itself is only about a few inches.

00:08:12.150 --> 00:08:17.150
(Applause)

00:08:17.150 --> 00:08:20.150
Now, this is a funny sort of conceptual thing,

00:08:20.150 --> 00:08:25.150
and yesterday we were talking about Danny Hillis' "10,000 Year Clock."

00:08:25.150 --> 00:08:27.150
So, we have a motor here on the left,

00:08:27.150 --> 00:08:30.150
and it goes through a gear train.

00:08:30.150 --> 00:08:35.150
There are 12 pairs of 50:1 reductions,

00:08:35.150 --> 00:08:40.150
so that means that the final speed of that gear on the end

00:08:40.150 --> 00:08:44.150
is so slow that it would take two trillion years to turn once.

00:08:44.150 --> 00:08:47.150
So I've invented it in concrete, because it doesn't really matter.

00:08:47.150 --> 00:08:48.150
(Laughter)

00:08:48.150 --> 00:08:50.150
Because it could run all the time.

00:08:50.150 --> 00:08:51.150
(Laughter)

00:08:51.150 --> 00:08:55.150
Now, a completely different thought.

00:08:55.150 --> 00:08:59.150
I'm always imagining myself in different situations.

00:08:59.150 --> 00:09:01.150
I'm imagining myself as a machine.

00:09:01.150 --> 00:09:03.150
What would I love?

00:09:03.150 --> 00:09:05.150
I would love to be bathed in oil.

00:09:05.150 --> 00:09:06.150
(Laughter)

00:09:06.150 --> 00:09:11.150
So, this machine does nothing but just bathe itself in oil.

00:09:11.150 --> 00:09:13.150
(Laughter)

00:09:13.150 --> 00:09:17.150
(Applause)

00:09:17.150 --> 00:09:20.150
And it's really, just sort of --

00:09:20.150 --> 00:09:23.150
for me, it was just really about the lusciousness of oil.

00:09:23.150 --> 00:09:24.150
(Laughter)

00:09:24.150 --> 00:09:27.150
And then, I got a call from a friend

00:09:27.150 --> 00:09:30.150
who wanted to have a show of erotic art,

00:09:30.150 --> 00:09:32.150
and I didn't have any pieces.

00:09:32.150 --> 00:09:36.150
But when she suggested to be in the show, this piece came to mind.

00:09:36.150 --> 00:09:40.150
So, it's sort of related, but you can see it's much more overtly erotic.

00:09:42.150 --> 00:09:45.150
And this one I call "Machine with Grease."

00:09:45.150 --> 00:09:47.150
It's just continually ejaculating, and it's --

00:09:47.150 --> 00:09:48.150
(Laughter) --

00:09:48.150 --> 00:09:51.150
this is a happy machine, I'll tell you.

00:09:51.150 --> 00:09:52.150
(Laughter)

00:09:52.150 --> 00:09:54.150
It's definitely happy.

00:09:56.150 --> 00:09:59.150
From an engineering point of view,

00:09:59.150 --> 00:10:01.150
this is just a little four-bar linkage.

00:10:01.150 --> 00:10:06.150
And then again, this is a found object, a little fan that I found.

00:10:06.150 --> 00:10:09.150
And I thought, what about the gesture of opening the fan,

00:10:09.150 --> 00:10:12.150
and how simply could I state something.

00:10:12.150 --> 00:10:20.150
And, in a case like this, I'm trying to make something which is clear

00:10:20.150 --> 00:10:25.150
but also not suggestive of any particular kind of animal or plant.

00:10:27.150 --> 00:10:32.150
For me, the process is very important,

00:10:32.150 --> 00:10:34.150
because I'm inventing machines,

00:10:34.150 --> 00:10:37.150
but I'm also inventing tools to make machines,

00:10:37.150 --> 00:10:40.150
and the whole thing is all sort of wrapped up from the beginning.

00:10:40.150 --> 00:10:43.150
So this is a little wire-bending tool.

00:10:43.150 --> 00:10:46.150
After many years of bending gears with a pair of pliers,

00:10:46.150 --> 00:10:49.150
I made that tool, and then I made this other tool

00:10:49.150 --> 00:10:52.150
for sort of centering gears very quickly --

00:10:53.150 --> 00:10:56.150
sort of developing my own little world of technology.

00:10:56.150 --> 00:11:02.150
My life completely changed when I found a spot welder.

00:11:02.150 --> 00:11:03.150
(Laughter)

00:11:03.150 --> 00:11:05.150
And that was that tool.

00:11:05.150 --> 00:11:07.150
It completely changed what I could do.

00:11:07.150 --> 00:11:11.150
Now here, I'm going to do a very poor job of silver soldering.

00:11:12.150 --> 00:11:17.150
This is not the way they teach you to silver solder when you're in school.

00:11:17.150 --> 00:11:19.150
I just like, throw it in.

00:11:19.150 --> 00:11:21.150
I mean, real jewelers put little bits of solder in.

00:11:22.150 --> 00:11:25.150
So, that's a finished gear.

00:11:26.150 --> 00:11:28.150
When I moved to Boston,

00:11:28.150 --> 00:11:33.150
I joined a group called the World Sculpture Racing Society.

00:11:33.150 --> 00:11:34.150
(Laughter)

00:11:34.150 --> 00:11:41.150
And the idea, their premise was that we wanted to show

00:11:41.150 --> 00:11:43.150
pieces of sculpture on the street,

00:11:43.150 --> 00:11:47.150
and there'd be no subjective decision about what was the best.

00:11:47.150 --> 00:11:49.150
It would be -- whatever came across the finish line first would be the winner.

00:11:49.150 --> 00:11:50.150
(Laughter)

00:11:50.150 --> 00:11:54.150
So I made -- this is my first racing sculpture,

00:11:54.150 --> 00:11:56.150
and I thought, "Oh, I'm going to make a cart,

00:11:56.150 --> 00:11:58.150
and I'm going to have it --

00:11:58.150 --> 00:12:00.150
I'm going to have my hand writing 'faster,'

00:12:00.150 --> 00:12:04.150
so as I run down the street, the cart's going to talk to me

00:12:04.150 --> 00:12:07.150
and it's going to go, 'Faster, faster!' "

00:12:07.150 --> 00:12:09.150
So, that's what it does.

00:12:09.150 --> 00:12:10.150
(Laughter)

00:12:10.150 --> 00:12:15.150
But then in the end, what I decided

00:12:15.150 --> 00:12:18.150
was every time you finish writing the word,

00:12:18.150 --> 00:12:22.150
I would stop and I would give the card to somebody on the side of the road.

00:12:22.150 --> 00:12:25.150
So I would never win the race because I'm always stopping.

00:12:25.150 --> 00:12:27.150
But I had a lot of fun.

00:12:27.150 --> 00:12:33.150
(Applause)

00:12:33.150 --> 00:12:37.150
Now, I only have two and a half minutes -- I'm going to play this.

00:12:37.150 --> 00:12:43.150
This is a piece that, for me, is in some ways

00:12:43.150 --> 00:12:45.150
the most complete kind of piece.

00:12:45.150 --> 00:12:47.150
Because when I was a kid, I also played a lot of guitar.

00:12:47.150 --> 00:12:51.150
And when I had this thought,

00:12:51.150 --> 00:12:53.150
I was imagining that I would make --

00:12:53.150 --> 00:12:56.150
I would have a whole machine theater evening,

00:12:56.150 --> 00:12:58.150
where I would -- you would have an audience,

00:12:58.150 --> 00:13:02.150
the curtain would open, and you'd be entertained by machines on stage.

00:13:02.150 --> 00:13:05.150
So, I imagined a very simple gestural dance

00:13:05.150 --> 00:13:13.150
that would be between a machine and just a very simple chair, and ...

00:13:21.150 --> 00:13:25.150
When I'm making these pieces, I'm always trying to find a point

00:13:25.150 --> 00:13:36.150
where I'm saying something very clearly and it's very simple,

00:13:36.150 --> 00:13:39.150
but also at the same time it's very ambiguous.

00:13:39.150 --> 00:13:44.150
And I think there's a point between simplicity and ambiguity

00:13:44.150 --> 00:13:50.150
which can allow a viewer to perhaps take something from it.

00:13:53.150 --> 00:13:57.150
And that leads me to the thought that all of these pieces

00:13:57.150 --> 00:14:01.150
start off in my own mind, in my heart,

00:14:01.150 --> 00:14:08.150
and I do my best at finding ways to express them with materials,

00:14:08.150 --> 00:14:10.150
and it always feels really crude.

00:14:10.150 --> 00:14:12.150
It's always a struggle,

00:14:13.150 --> 00:14:17.150
but somehow I manage to sort of get this thought

00:14:17.150 --> 00:14:21.150
out into an object, and then it's there, OK.

00:14:21.150 --> 00:14:23.150
It means nothing at all.

00:14:23.150 --> 00:14:25.150
The object itself just means nothing.

00:14:25.150 --> 00:14:30.150
Once it's perceived, and someone brings it into their own mind,

00:14:30.150 --> 00:14:35.150
then there's a cycle that has been completed.

00:14:35.150 --> 00:14:37.150
And to me, that's the most important thing

00:14:37.150 --> 00:14:42.150
because, ever since being a kid, I've wanted to communicate my passion and love.

00:14:42.150 --> 00:14:47.150
And that means the complete cycle of coming from inside,

00:14:47.150 --> 00:14:52.150
out to the physical, to someone perceiving it.

00:14:55.150 --> 00:14:59.150
So I'll just let this chair come down.

00:15:27.150 --> 00:15:28.150
(Applause)

00:15:28.150 --> 00:15:29.150
Thank you.

00:15:29.150 --> 00:15:32.150
(Applause)
