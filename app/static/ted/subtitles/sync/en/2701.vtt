00:00:13.941 --> 00:00:16.500
(Guitar)

00:00:30.208 --> 00:00:31.211
(Singing)

00:00:31.211 --> 00:00:35.301
Rollercoaster,

00:00:35.301 --> 00:00:37.361
carousel.

00:00:40.802 --> 00:00:43.662
Where the highs are heaven,

00:00:43.662 --> 00:00:44.771
but the lows,

00:00:44.771 --> 00:00:47.360
oh, they can be hell.

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:51.136
You can grab the ring,

00:00:51.136 --> 00:00:54.571
you can ring that bell,

00:00:54.571 --> 00:00:58.920
when the ride is over,

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.884
you can never tell.

00:01:04.165 --> 00:01:08.008
People tell you this one thing --

00:01:08.008 --> 00:01:10.691
will make your life complete.

00:01:10.691 --> 00:01:12.121
So you,

00:01:12.121 --> 00:01:14.658
you give it everything you got

00:01:14.658 --> 00:01:18.188
and you wind up on the street.

00:01:19.875 --> 00:01:23.859
Then one day you wake up,

00:01:23.859 --> 00:01:27.808
and they tell you "you're a queen,"

00:01:27.808 --> 00:01:31.615
but then you find that someone else

00:01:31.615 --> 00:01:33.792
is pulling on the strings.

00:01:33.792 --> 00:01:38.052
Rollercoaster,

00:01:38.052 --> 00:01:40.612
carousel.

00:01:43.338 --> 00:01:46.155
Where the highs are heaven,

00:01:46.155 --> 00:01:47.231
but the lows,

00:01:47.231 --> 00:01:49.870
oh, they can be hell.

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:53.456
You can grab the ring,

00:01:53.456 --> 00:01:56.927
you can ring that bell,

00:01:56.927 --> 00:02:01.191
when the ride is over,

00:02:01.191 --> 00:02:03.625
you can never tell.

00:02:06.293 --> 00:02:07.662
The one you love,

00:02:07.662 --> 00:02:08.711
they love you --

00:02:08.711 --> 00:02:10.342
oh yeah --

00:02:10.342 --> 00:02:13.374
until the end of time.

00:02:14.231 --> 00:02:16.851
But lose your edge or lose your cool,

00:02:16.851 --> 00:02:20.683
they will drop you like a dime.

00:02:21.868 --> 00:02:25.830
Everyone is crowding 'round

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:29.690
when fortune is your friend.

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:33.545
When your luck is running out,

00:02:33.545 --> 00:02:35.770
you're all alone again.

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:39.945
Rollercoaster,

00:02:39.945 --> 00:02:43.324
carousel.

00:02:45.092 --> 00:02:48.053
Where the highs are heaven

00:02:48.053 --> 00:02:49.233
but the lows,

00:02:49.233 --> 00:02:51.569
oh, they can be hell.

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:55.283
You can grab the ring,

00:02:55.283 --> 00:02:58.679
you can ring that bell,

00:02:58.679 --> 00:03:02.913
when the ride is over

00:03:02.913 --> 00:03:05.692
you can never tell.

00:03:08.314 --> 00:03:12.198
Well, maybe I'm just cynical,

00:03:12.198 --> 00:03:16.188
and all these words are lies,

00:03:16.188 --> 00:03:18.979
but experience keeps telling me

00:03:18.979 --> 00:03:22.001
that the cautious one is wise.

00:03:23.998 --> 00:03:27.854
But caution makes you hesitate,

00:03:27.854 --> 00:03:31.752
and hesitate you're lost,

00:03:31.752 --> 00:03:35.659
so take your opportunities

00:03:35.659 --> 00:03:37.839
and never count the cost.

00:03:37.839 --> 00:03:41.889
Rollercoaster,

00:03:41.889 --> 00:03:45.347
carousel.

00:03:47.317 --> 00:03:50.001
Where the highs are heaven,

00:03:50.001 --> 00:03:51.371
but the lows,

00:03:51.371 --> 00:03:53.639
oh, they can be hell.

00:03:53.639 --> 00:03:57.101
You can grab the ring,

00:03:57.101 --> 00:04:00.587
you can ring that bell,

00:04:00.587 --> 00:04:03.121
when the ride is over --

00:04:03.121 --> 00:04:04.894
over, over,

00:04:04.894 --> 00:04:08.711
you can never, ever tell.

00:04:08.711 --> 00:04:12.554
Rollercoaster,

00:04:12.554 --> 00:04:16.429
carousel,

00:04:16.429 --> 00:04:18.244
rollercoaster,

00:04:18.244 --> 00:04:20.347
yeah, yeah, yeah,

00:04:20.347 --> 00:04:23.858
carousel.

00:04:24.277 --> 00:04:28.061
Carousel,

00:04:28.061 --> 00:04:32.111
carousel,

00:04:32.111 --> 00:04:35.947
carousel,

00:04:35.947 --> 00:04:44.782
carousel.

00:04:45.627 --> 00:04:48.225

00:04:48.843 --> 00:04:50.961
Michael Pemberton.

00:04:50.961 --> 00:04:53.412

00:04:54.115 --> 00:04:55.835
Thank you so much.

00:04:55.835 --> 00:04:56.910
Thank you.
