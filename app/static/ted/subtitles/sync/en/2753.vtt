00:00:19.465 --> 00:00:25.346
It's 4 a.m., 
and the big test is in eight hours,

00:00:25.346 --> 00:00:28.267
followed by a piano recital.

00:00:28.267 --> 00:00:34.038
You've been studying and playing for days,
but you still don't feel ready for either.

00:00:34.038 --> 00:00:35.471
So, what can you do?

00:00:35.471 --> 00:00:37.470
Well, you can drink another cup of coffee

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:40.228
and spend the next few hours 
cramming and practicing,

00:00:40.228 --> 00:00:42.154
but believe it or not,

00:00:42.154 --> 00:00:45.632
you might be better off closing the books,
putting away the music,

00:00:45.632 --> 00:00:47.967
and going to sleep.

00:00:47.967 --> 00:00:50.326
Sleep occupies nearly 
a third of our lives,

00:00:50.326 --> 00:00:55.301
but many of us give surprisingly
little attention and care to it.

00:00:55.301 --> 00:00:58.880
This neglect is often the result 
of a major misunderstanding.

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:00.789
Sleep isn't lost time,

00:01:00.789 --> 00:01:04.479
or just a way to rest 
when all our important work is done.

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:06.487
Instead, it's a critical function,

00:01:06.487 --> 00:01:10.907
during which your body balances
and regulates its vital systems,

00:01:10.907 --> 00:01:12.500
affecting respiration

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:17.585
and regulating everything from circulation
to growth and immune response.

00:01:17.585 --> 00:01:22.968
That's great, but you can worry about 
all those things after this test, right?

00:01:22.968 --> 00:01:24.586
Well, not so fast.

00:01:24.586 --> 00:01:27.623
It turns out that sleep 
is also crucial for your brain,

00:01:27.623 --> 00:01:30.323
with a fifth of your body's 
circulatory blood

00:01:30.323 --> 00:01:33.003
being channeled to it as you drift off.

00:01:33.003 --> 00:01:35.610
And what goes on 
in your brain while you sleep

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.691
is an intensely active period 
of restructuring

00:01:38.691 --> 00:01:41.509
that's crucial for how our memory works.

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:42.506
At first glance,

00:01:42.506 --> 00:01:46.405
our ability to remember things 
doesn't seem very impressive at all.

00:01:46.405 --> 00:01:49.188
19th century psychologist 
Herman Ebbinghaus

00:01:49.188 --> 00:01:53.063
demonstrated that we normally forget
40% of new material

00:01:53.063 --> 00:01:55.544
within the first twenty minutes,

00:01:55.544 --> 00:01:59.284
a phenomenon known
as the forgetting curve.

00:01:59.284 --> 00:02:02.885
But this loss can be prevented 
through memory consolidation,

00:02:02.885 --> 00:02:05.439
the process by which
information is moved

00:02:05.439 --> 00:02:11.053
from our fleeting short-term memory
to our more durable long-term memory.

00:02:11.053 --> 00:02:14.773
This consolidation occurs with the help
of a major part of the brain,

00:02:14.773 --> 00:02:17.490
known as the hippocampus.

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:19.510
Its role in long-term memory formation

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:23.518
was demonstrated in the 1950s
by Brenda Milner

00:02:23.518 --> 00:02:26.806
in her research with 
a patient known as H.M.

00:02:26.806 --> 00:02:29.105
After having his hippocampus removed,

00:02:29.105 --> 00:02:33.473
H.M.'s ability to form new short-term memories
was damaged,

00:02:33.473 --> 00:02:38.038
but he was able to learn physical tasks
through repetition.

00:02:38.038 --> 00:02:39.869
Due to the removal of his hippocampus,

00:02:39.869 --> 00:02:44.444
H.M.'s ability to form long-term memories
was also damaged.

00:02:44.444 --> 00:02:46.587
What this case revealed,
among other things,

00:02:46.587 --> 00:02:49.509
was that the hippocampus 
was specifically involved

00:02:49.509 --> 00:02:54.212
in the consolidation of
long-term declarative memory,

00:02:54.212 --> 00:02:57.466
such as the facts and concepts
you need to remember for that test,

00:02:57.466 --> 00:02:59.275
rather than procedural memory,

00:02:59.275 --> 00:03:03.878
such as the finger movements
you need to master for that recital.

00:03:03.878 --> 00:03:07.544
Milner's findings, along with work 
by Eric Kandel in the 90's,

00:03:07.544 --> 00:03:12.896
have given us our current model 
of how this consolidation process works.

00:03:12.896 --> 00:03:14.948
Sensory data is initially transcribed

00:03:14.948 --> 00:03:19.221
and temporarily recorded in the neurons
as short-term memory.

00:03:19.221 --> 00:03:21.774
From there, it travels to the hippocampus,

00:03:21.774 --> 00:03:25.300
which strengthens and enhances 
the neurons in that cortical area.

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:27.519
Thanks to the phenomenon
of neuroplasticity,

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:32.491
new synaptic buds are formed,
allowing new connections between neurons,

00:03:32.491 --> 00:03:34.334
and strengthening the neural network

00:03:34.334 --> 00:03:38.084
where the information will be returned
as long-term memory.

00:03:38.084 --> 00:03:40.951
So why do we remember
some things and not others?

00:03:40.951 --> 00:03:42.839
Well, there are a few ways to influence

00:03:42.839 --> 00:03:46.450
the extent and effectiveness 
of memory retention.

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:50.585
For example, memories that are formed
in times of heightened feeling,

00:03:50.585 --> 00:03:51.620
or even stress,

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:56.877
will be better recorded due to 
the hippocampus' link with emotion.

00:03:56.877 --> 00:04:00.873
But one of the major factors contributing
to memory consolidation is,

00:04:00.873 --> 00:04:02.041
you guessed it,

00:04:02.041 --> 00:04:04.028
a good night's sleep.

00:04:04.028 --> 00:04:06.364
Sleep is composed of four stages,

00:04:06.364 --> 00:04:09.102
the deepest of which are known
as slow-wave sleep

00:04:09.102 --> 00:04:11.378
and rapid eye movement.

00:04:11.378 --> 00:04:14.537
EEG machines monitoring
people during these stages

00:04:14.537 --> 00:04:16.527
have shown electrical impulses

00:04:16.527 --> 00:04:21.836
moving between the brainstem,
hippocampus, thalamus, and cortex,

00:04:21.836 --> 00:04:25.678
which serve as relay stations 
of memory formation.

00:04:25.678 --> 00:04:29.051
And the different stages of sleep
have been shown to help consolidate

00:04:29.051 --> 00:04:31.258
different types of memories.

00:04:31.258 --> 00:04:34.707
During the non-REM slow-wave sleep,

00:04:34.707 --> 00:04:38.275
declarative memory is encoded 
into a temporary store

00:04:38.275 --> 00:04:41.102
in the anterior part of the hippocampus.

00:04:41.102 --> 00:04:44.944
Through a continuing dialogue 
between the cortex and hippocampus,

00:04:44.944 --> 00:04:47.647
it is then repeatedly reactivated,

00:04:47.647 --> 00:04:53.148
driving its gradual redistribution
to long-term storage in the cortex.

00:04:53.148 --> 00:04:57.034
REM sleep, on the other hand, with
its similarity to waking brain activity,

00:04:57.034 --> 00:05:00.624
is associated with the consolidation
of procedural memory.

00:05:00.624 --> 00:05:02.455
So based on the studies,

00:05:02.455 --> 00:05:05.683
going to sleep three hours after 
memorizing your formulas

00:05:05.683 --> 00:05:10.665
and one hour after practicing your scales
would be the most ideal.

00:05:10.665 --> 00:05:13.167
So hopefully you can see now
that skimping on sleep

00:05:13.167 --> 00:05:15.442
not only harms your long-term health,

00:05:15.442 --> 00:05:17.221
but actually makes it less likely

00:05:17.221 --> 00:05:21.570
that you'll retain all that knowledge
and practice from the previous night,

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:25.693
all of which just goes to affirm
the wisdom of the phrase, "Sleep on it."

00:05:25.693 --> 00:05:27.787
When you think about 
all the internal restructuring

00:05:27.787 --> 00:05:31.516
and forming of new connections
that occurs while you slumber,

00:05:31.516 --> 00:05:33.434
you could even say that proper sleep

00:05:33.434 --> 00:05:37.243
will have you waking up every morning
with a new and improved brain,

00:05:37.243 --> 00:05:39.737
ready to face the challenges ahead.
