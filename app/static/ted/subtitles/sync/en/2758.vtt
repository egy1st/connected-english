00:00:22.353 --> 00:00:25.890
The constant thud underneath your feet,

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:27.887
the constrained space,

00:00:27.887 --> 00:00:31.757
and the monotony of going nowhere fast.

00:00:31.757 --> 00:00:36.272
It feels like hours have gone by,
but it's only been eleven minutes,

00:00:36.272 --> 00:00:37.333
and you wonder,

00:00:37.333 --> 00:00:39.131
"Why am I torturing myself?

00:00:39.131 --> 00:00:43.882
This thing has got to be considered 
a cruel and unusual punishment."

00:00:43.882 --> 00:00:47.252
Actually, that's exactly 
what it is, or was.

00:00:47.252 --> 00:00:49.410
You see, in the 1800s,

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:54.199
treadmills were created 
to punish English prisoners.

00:00:54.199 --> 00:00:58.124
At the time, the English prison system
was abysmally bad.

00:00:58.124 --> 00:01:02.360
Execution and deportation
were often the punishments of choice,

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:07.856
and those who were locked away
faced hours of solitude in filthy cells.

00:01:07.856 --> 00:01:11.090
So social movements led by
religious groups, philanthropies,

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:13.683
and celebrities, like Charles Dickens,

00:01:13.683 --> 00:01:18.582
sought to change these dire conditions
and help reform the prisoners.

00:01:18.582 --> 00:01:20.439
When their movement succeeded,

00:01:20.439 --> 00:01:24.746
entire prisons were remodeled
and new forms of rehabilitation,

00:01:24.746 --> 00:01:27.870
such as the treadmill,
were introduced.

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:29.814
Here's how the original version,

00:01:29.814 --> 00:01:35.797
invented in 1818 by English engineer 
Sir William Cubitt, worked.

00:01:35.797 --> 00:01:40.205
Prisoners stepped on 24 spokes
of a large paddle wheel.

00:01:40.205 --> 00:01:41.408
As the wheel turned,

00:01:41.408 --> 00:01:45.750
the prisoner was forced 
to keep stepping up or risk falling off,

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.590
similar to modern stepper machines.

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:52.418
Meanwhile, the rotation made gears
pump out water,

00:01:52.418 --> 00:01:54.029
crush grain,

00:01:54.029 --> 00:01:55.347
or power mills,

00:01:55.347 --> 00:01:58.367
which is where the name 
"treadmill" originated.

00:01:58.367 --> 00:02:02.892
These devices were seen as a fantastic
way of whipping prisoners into shape,

00:02:02.892 --> 00:02:05.307
and that added benefit of powering mills

00:02:05.307 --> 00:02:10.441
helped to rebuild a British economy
decimated by the Napoleonic Wars.

00:02:10.441 --> 00:02:14.488
It was a win for all concerned,
except the prisoners.

00:02:14.488 --> 00:02:16.420
It's estimated that, on average,

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:20.566
prisoners spent six 
or so hours a day on treadmills,

00:02:20.566 --> 00:02:24.519
the equivalent of climbing
5,000 to 14,000 feet.

00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:29.502
14,000 feet is roughly 
Mount Everest's halfway point.

00:02:29.502 --> 00:02:33.619
Imagine doing that five days a week
with little food.

00:02:33.619 --> 00:02:37.472
Cubitt's idea quickly spread
across the British Empire and America.

00:02:37.472 --> 00:02:39.395
Within a decade of its creation,

00:02:39.395 --> 00:02:42.776
over 50 English prisons 
boasted a treadmill,

00:02:42.776 --> 00:02:44.828
and America, a similar amount.

00:02:44.828 --> 00:02:48.621
Unsurprisingly, the exertion combined
with poor nutrition

00:02:48.621 --> 00:02:51.680
saw many prisoners suffer breakdowns
and injuries,

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:54.411
not that prison guards seemed to care.

00:02:54.411 --> 00:02:58.998
In 1824, New York prison guard
James Hardie credited the device

00:02:58.998 --> 00:03:01.982
with taming his more 
boisterous inmates, writing that

00:03:01.982 --> 00:03:07.804
the "monotonous steadiness, and not 
its severity...constitutes its terror,"

00:03:07.804 --> 00:03:11.271
a quote many still agree with.

00:03:11.271 --> 00:03:14.775
And treadmills lasted in England
until the late 19th century,

00:03:14.775 --> 00:03:17.080
when they were banned for being
excessively cruel

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:20.780
under the Prison's Act of 1898.

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:23.768
But of course the torture device
returned with a vengeance,

00:03:23.768 --> 00:03:27.814
this time targeting 
the unsuspecting public.

00:03:27.814 --> 00:03:32.471
In 1911, a treadmill patent 
was registered in the U.S.,

00:03:32.471 --> 00:03:38.283
and by 1952, the forerunner for 
today's modern treadmill had been created.

00:03:38.283 --> 00:03:41.853
When the jogging craze 
hit the U.S. in the 1970s,

00:03:41.853 --> 00:03:44.391
the treadmill was thrust 
back into the limelight

00:03:44.391 --> 00:03:48.634
as an easy and convenient 
way to improve aerobic fitness,

00:03:48.634 --> 00:03:50.757
and lose unwanted pounds,

00:03:50.757 --> 00:03:53.393
which, to be fair, 
it's pretty good at doing.

00:03:53.393 --> 00:03:56.540
And the machine 
has maintained its popularity since.

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:00.179
So the next time you voluntarily subject
yourself to what was once

00:04:00.179 --> 00:04:02.577
a cruel and unusual punishment,

00:04:02.577 --> 00:04:05.978
just be glad you can control
when you'll hop off.
