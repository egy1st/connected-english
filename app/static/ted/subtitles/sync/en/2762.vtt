00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:20.831
Way before the first selfie,

00:00:20.831 --> 00:00:23.033
the ancient Greeks and Romans had a myth

00:00:23.033 --> 00:00:26.755
about someone a little too obsessed 
with his own image.

00:00:26.755 --> 00:00:28.045
In one telling,

00:00:28.045 --> 00:00:32.929
Narcissus was a handsome guy wandering
the world in search of someone to love.

00:00:32.929 --> 00:00:35.385
After rejecting a nymph named Echo,

00:00:35.385 --> 00:00:38.859
he caught a glimpse 
of his own reflection in a river,

00:00:38.859 --> 00:00:40.661
and fell in love with it.

00:00:40.661 --> 00:00:42.266
Unable to tear himself away,

00:00:42.266 --> 00:00:44.094
Narcissus drowned.

00:00:44.094 --> 00:00:49.190
A flower marked the spot of where he died,
and we call that flower the Narcissus.

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:52.541
The myth captures 
the basic idea of narcissism,

00:00:52.541 --> 00:00:56.330
elevated and sometimes 
detrimental self-involvement.

00:00:56.330 --> 00:01:00.424
But it's not just a personality type
that shows up in advice columns.

00:01:00.424 --> 00:01:05.116
It's actually a set of traits classified
and studied by psychologists.

00:01:05.116 --> 00:01:10.922
The psychological definition of narcissism
is an inflated, grandiose self-image.

00:01:10.922 --> 00:01:14.269
To varying degrees, narcissists think
they're better looking,

00:01:14.269 --> 00:01:15.123
smarter,

00:01:15.123 --> 00:01:17.383
and more important than other people,

00:01:17.383 --> 00:01:20.161
and that they deserve special treatment.

00:01:20.161 --> 00:01:24.917
Psychologists recognize two forms
of narcissism as a personality trait:

00:01:24.917 --> 00:01:28.039
grandiose and vulnerable narcissism.

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:30.556
There's also narcissistic 
personality disorder,

00:01:30.556 --> 00:01:34.216
a more extreme form,
which we'll return to shortly.

00:01:34.216 --> 00:01:37.951
Grandiose narcissism 
is the most familiar kind,

00:01:37.951 --> 00:01:39.939
characterized by extroversion,

00:01:39.939 --> 00:01:41.106
dominance,

00:01:41.106 --> 00:01:42.681
and attention seeking.

00:01:42.681 --> 00:01:45.962
Grandiose narcissists pursue 
attention and power,

00:01:45.962 --> 00:01:47.607
sometimes as politicians,

00:01:47.607 --> 00:01:48.607
celebrities,

00:01:48.607 --> 00:01:50.440
or cultural leaders.

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:54.786
Of course, not everyone who pursues
these positions of power is narcissistic.

00:01:54.786 --> 00:01:56.556
Many do it for very positive reasons,

00:01:56.556 --> 00:01:58.232
like reaching their full potential,

00:01:58.232 --> 00:02:00.641
or helping make people's lives better.

00:02:00.641 --> 00:02:02.927
But narcissistic individuals seek power

00:02:02.927 --> 00:02:05.923
for the status 
and attention that goes with it.

00:02:05.923 --> 00:02:10.069
Meanwhile, vulnerable narcissists
can be quiet and reserved.

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:11.983
They have a strong sense of entitlement,

00:02:11.983 --> 00:02:14.943
but are easily threatened or slighted.

00:02:14.943 --> 00:02:19.211
In either case, the dark side of
narcissism shows up over the long term.

00:02:19.211 --> 00:02:22.141
Narcissists tend to act selfishly,

00:02:22.141 --> 00:02:26.526
so narcissistic leaders may make risky
or unethical decisions,

00:02:26.526 --> 00:02:31.294
and narcissistic partners may be dishonest
or unfaithful.

00:02:31.294 --> 00:02:33.830
When their rosy view of themselves
is challenged,

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:36.373
they can become resentful and aggressive.

00:02:36.373 --> 00:02:39.334
It's like a disease where the sufferers
feel pretty good,

00:02:39.334 --> 00:02:41.655
but the people around them suffer.

00:02:41.655 --> 00:02:43.068
Taken to the extreme,

00:02:43.068 --> 00:02:46.358
this behavior is classified 
as a psychological disorder

00:02:46.358 --> 00:02:49.114
called narcissistic personality disorder.

00:02:49.114 --> 00:02:52.077
It affects one to two percent
of the population,

00:02:52.077 --> 00:02:53.656
more commonly men.

00:02:53.656 --> 00:02:56.814
It is also a diagnosis 
reserved for adults.

00:02:56.814 --> 00:03:00.295
Young people, especially children,
can be very self-centered,

00:03:00.295 --> 00:03:03.641
but this might just be a normal
part of development.

00:03:03.641 --> 00:03:06.922
The fifth edition of the American
Psychiatric Association's

00:03:06.922 --> 00:03:09.461
Diagnostic and Statistical Manual

00:03:09.461 --> 00:03:14.008
describes several traits associated
with narcissistic personality disorder.

00:03:14.008 --> 00:03:16.928
They include a grandiose view of oneself,

00:03:16.928 --> 00:03:18.307
problems with empathy,

00:03:18.307 --> 00:03:19.923
a sense of entitlement,

00:03:19.923 --> 00:03:22.954
and a need for admiration or attention.

00:03:22.954 --> 00:03:25.692
What makes these trait a true
personality disorder

00:03:25.692 --> 00:03:30.039
is that they take over people's lives
and cause significant problems.

00:03:30.039 --> 00:03:33.247
Imagine that instead of caring
for your spouse or children,

00:03:33.247 --> 00:03:36.579
you used them as a source
of attention or admiration.

00:03:36.579 --> 00:03:38.252
Or imagine that instead of seeking

00:03:38.252 --> 00:03:40.558
constructive feedback 
about your performance,

00:03:40.558 --> 00:03:42.947
you instead told everyone 
who tried to help you

00:03:42.947 --> 00:03:45.058
that they were wrong.

00:03:45.058 --> 00:03:47.380
So what causes narcissism?

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:50.119
Twin studies show 
a strong genetic component,

00:03:50.119 --> 00:03:53.173
although we don't know 
which genes are involved.

00:03:53.173 --> 00:03:55.045
But environment matters, too.

00:03:55.045 --> 00:03:57.390
Parents who put their child
on a pedestal

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:59.939
can foster grandiose narcissism.

00:03:59.939 --> 00:04:05.200
And cold, controlling parents
can contribute to vulnerable narcissism.

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:07.409
Narcissism also seems to be higher

00:04:07.409 --> 00:04:11.579
in cultures that value individuality
and self-promotion.

00:04:11.579 --> 00:04:13.320
In the United States, for example,

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:18.052
narcissism as a personality trait
has been rising since the 1970s,

00:04:18.052 --> 00:04:20.141
when the communal focus of the 60s

00:04:20.141 --> 00:04:22.300
gave way to the self-esteem movement

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:24.783
and a rise in materialism.

00:04:24.783 --> 00:04:29.228
More recently, social media has multiplied
the possibilities for self-promotion,

00:04:29.228 --> 00:04:30.521
though it's worth noting

00:04:30.521 --> 00:04:34.341
that there's no clear evidence
that social media causes narcissism.

00:04:34.341 --> 00:04:39.914
Rather, it provides narcissists a means
to seek social status and attention.

00:04:39.914 --> 00:04:43.385
So can narcissists improve 
on those negative traits?

00:04:43.385 --> 00:04:44.624
Yes!

00:04:44.624 --> 00:04:47.600
Anything that promotes honest reflection
on their own behavior

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:49.254
and caring for others,

00:04:49.254 --> 00:04:54.266
like psychotherapy or practicing 
compassion towards others, can be helpful.

00:04:54.266 --> 00:04:56.322
The difficulty is it can be challenging

00:04:56.322 --> 00:04:58.862
for people with 
narcissistic personality disorder

00:04:58.862 --> 00:05:01.061
to keep working at self-betterment.

00:05:01.061 --> 00:05:05.913
For a narcissist, self-reflection is hard
from an unflattering angle.
