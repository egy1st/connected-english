00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:16.046
Gayle King: Have a seat, Serena Williams,

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:18.766
or should we say, have a seat, mom.

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:21.555
(Cheers)

00:00:21.579 --> 00:00:23.486
So no doubt, you guys are like me.

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:26.126
You saw the release of Serena

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:28.206
in that great yellow
bathing suit last week

00:00:28.229 --> 00:00:30.646
and when I saw it,
all I could think of was,

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:34.446
"Gosh, why couldn't she have waited
til we sat onstage for TED?"

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:36.406
I was very selfish, I know.

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:38.086
So I asked you about that picture,

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:40.886
and you said nobody was
supposed to see that picture.

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:42.166
What do you mean?

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:45.246
Serena Williams: Well,
actually, it was an accident.

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.046
I was on vacation,
just taking some time for myself,

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:53.046
and I have this thing
where I've been checking my status

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.406
and taking pictures every week
to see how far along I'm going --

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.326
GK: And sharing it with friends, maybe?

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.046
SW: No, actually
I have just been saving it,

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:03.086
and I didn't really tell a lot of people,

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:04.686
to be quite honest,

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:05.926
and I'd been saving it,

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:09.206
and you know how social media is,
you press the wrong button and --

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:10.246
(Laughter)

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:11.886
GK: And there it was.

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:14.806
SW: So 30 minutes later --
my phone doesn't ring that much --

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:17.046
and 30 minutes later,
I missed like four calls,

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:18.406
and I'm like, that's weird,

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:21.366
and then I picked it up
and I was like, oh no.

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:22.606
But it was a good moment.

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:26.326
I was gonna wait literally
just five or six more days -- that's OK.

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:29.766
GK: I know, because it was weird,
Serena, because it only said 20 weeks,

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.646
so it's not like there was
a whole lot of information on it.

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.406
SW: Exactly, so that's
what I've been doing all this time.

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:36.766
I've been just tracking it.

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:40.206
18, 19 -- every week
I'd just take a picture and save it,

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:41.966
and I've been so good about it,

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:46.246
and this was the one time that I slipped.

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:48.846
GK: There you go. Well, congratulations.

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:50.126
SW: Yes, thank you.

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:52.286
GK: It really is OK.
When you heard the news,

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:54.766
were you excited?
Were you afraid? Were you worried?

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:56.326
That you were pregnant, I mean.

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:01.326
SW: So I heard it two days before
the beginning of the Australian Open,

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.286
which is one of the biggest grand slams.

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:04.966
GK: You found out two days before?

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:07.646
SW: Yeah, so it was
two days before, and I knew.

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:10.166
I was nervous.

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:11.846
I wasn't quite sure what to think,

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:13.606
but I just knew that at that moment

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:16.686
it was really important for me
to just focus right there

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:17.966
at the Australian Open,

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:22.246
and I was definitely not sure what to do.

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:23.646
I was like, can I play?

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:29.126
I know it's very dangerous, maybe,
sometimes in the first 12 weeks or so,

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:31.006
so I had a lot of questions.

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:34.566
GK: But not only did you play,
Ms. Williams, you won.

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:37.166
(Cheers)

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:38.390
SW: Yeah.

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:44.686
May I just say, 23 grand slams to you.

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:45.926
SW: Thank you.

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:47.166
(Applause)

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:48.566
GK: While pregnant!

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:51.926
SW: Well, I was looking
for another handicap, so ... no.

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:55.086
GK: Did you play differently that game,
knowing you were pregnant?

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:57.166
SW: I did. It wasn't very easy.

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:00.126
You hear all these stories
about people when they're pregnant,

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:01.766
they get sick and they get tired.

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:03.446
GK: Have you had morning sickness?

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:06.246
SW: No, I've been so fortunate
and so I haven't.

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:09.366
But they get really tired
and they get really stressed out,

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:12.326
and I had to really take all that energy,

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:14.366
put it in a paper bag, so to say,

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:15.606
and throw it away,

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:17.766
because I really felt
like I didn't have time

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:20.886
to deal with any extra emotions,
any extra anything,

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:23.326
because pregnant or not, no one knew,

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:25.326
and I was supposed to win that tournament

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:27.286
as I am every tournament that I show up.

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:28.526
I am expected to win,

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:30.966
and if I don't win,
it's actually much bigger news.

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:33.326
GK: Yeah, when you don't win,
that's a big story.

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:36.406
SW: Yes, so for me,
I had to really take anything negative

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:39.326
and any emotions
that I was feeling at that point

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:41.566
and kind of just bottle them up

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:44.726
and really figure out
what the next step for me to do was.

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:47.326
GK: You have a lot of support.
You have a lot of love.

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:50.286
Even when I was coming here,
people stopped me at the airport.

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:53.766
I was saying to the flight attendant,
the pilot, "Guess where I'm going?"

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:56.286
They said, "Oh my God,
we're so glad she's pregnant."

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:58.486
But then you always have
these cranky Yankees.

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:01.566
On the way over here, somebody
was telling me about Ilie Nastase,

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:04.766
who said some very unkind, inappropriate,
dare I say racial things.

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:06.046
You have responded to him.

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:08.126
I'm not even going
to dignify what he said,

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:10.046
but you responded. Why did you respond?

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:12.726
SW: Well, I think there are
very inappropriate comments,

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:15.486
and not only that, I've been
really supportive of my peers

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:17.326
and the people that I've worked with.

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:19.086
I've been a pro for almost 20 years,

00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:21.646
and so for me, it's really important
to hold women up,

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:23.686
and it's something that these young women,

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:27.046
they'll come to the locker room,
they'll want to take pictures with me,

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:28.405
and for me, it's just like,

00:04:28.429 --> 00:04:31.566
I want to be able to be a good leader
and a good example for them.

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:32.806
So not only --

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:34.046
(Applause)

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:38.246
Not only did he have rude things
to say about me and my peers,

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:40.966
I felt it was important
for us to stand up for each other

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:42.366
and to stand up for myself.

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:45.086
And at that point it was
really important for me to say,

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:47.966
like, I'm not afraid,
I'm not going anywhere,

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:50.566
but this is inappropriate,

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:53.046
and there's time and there's
a place for everything.

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:55.246
And that really
wasn't the time and the place.

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:58.166
GK: We cut the part where you said
you're not going anywhere,

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:00.686
because you'll be 36 in September.
Baby's coming, 36.

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:02.926
And your coach said
age is always important,

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:04.846
but in tennis it's very important,

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:06.966
but he has no doubt
that you're coming back.

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:08.686
Have you thought, am I coming back?

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:10.566
Will I take some time off?

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:12.526
I know the women on the tour are saying,

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:15.726
"How long does it take to have a baby?
Two years will she be gone?"

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:16.966
What are you thinking?

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:19.606
SW: Well, I'm always trying
to defy the odds, you know,

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:21.966
so for me everything is really mental.

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:24.406
I definitely plan on coming back.
I'm not done yet.

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:26.286
I'm really inspired by my sister.

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:28.966
She's a year older than me,
and that's something that --

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:31.006
if she's still playing, I know I can play.

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:32.606
(Laughter)

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:35.966
And there's so many -- Roger Federer,
he's a little bit older than me

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:40.086
and he's still winning everything,
so I'm like, I know I can do that too.

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:43.886
So that's been so inspiring to me,
especially recently,

00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:46.086
and I know that
it's something I want to do.

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:48.286
And my story is definitely not over yet.

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:50.206
I was talking to my coach about it,

00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:54.526
and we were talking about
how this is just a new part of my life,

00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:56.566
and my baby's going to be in the stands

00:05:56.590 --> 00:05:59.486
and hopefully cheering for me,
not crying too much.

00:05:59.510 --> 00:06:02.286
GK: No, you wrote a beautiful
letter to your baby yesterday

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:05.086
that you said -- from the oldest mommy
to the youngest one,

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:08.246
to the oldest, to the youngest,
I can't wait for you to get here.

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:09.686
A lot of people feel that.

00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:12.926
I saw you about a year ago,
because I think about your life, Serena.

00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:16.606
You've had three life-changing things
in a six-month time:

00:06:16.630 --> 00:06:19.846
pregnant, huge win, fell in love.

00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:21.726
And when I saw you last year,

00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:24.030
I was saying, "How's
your love life? Da da da."

00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:26.726
You said, "I met a guy.
He's a nerdy, kinda geeky guy.

00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:28.286
You won't know who he is."

00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:29.566
I said, "What's his name?"

00:06:29.590 --> 00:06:31.766
SW: I remember talking
to you about that, yes.

00:06:31.790 --> 00:06:35.806
GK: And you said, "Alexis Ohanian."
I said, "I know him!" He's awesome.

00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:37.926
But I would never put you
with a nerdy geek,

00:06:37.950 --> 00:06:39.206
and you said, you neither.

00:06:39.230 --> 00:06:41.726
SW: I'm going to be honest
with you, I didn't either,

00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:43.486
but it's been the best thing for me.

00:06:43.510 --> 00:06:45.446
GK: The best thing why?

00:06:45.470 --> 00:06:47.086
Does that look like a nerdy geek?

00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:48.326
Look at the shirt.

00:06:48.350 --> 00:06:49.366
(Laughter)

00:06:49.390 --> 00:06:50.646
No, he's a very nice guy.

00:06:50.670 --> 00:06:52.526
SW: You can tell he's into technology.

00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:54.286
GK: He's a very, very nice guy.

00:06:54.310 --> 00:06:55.886
I like him very much.

00:06:55.910 --> 00:06:58.166
So how did he succeed
when others have failed?

00:06:58.190 --> 00:07:02.086
How was he the one that you knew,
this is the one for me?

00:07:02.110 --> 00:07:04.366
SW: Well, I'm not going to say that,

00:07:04.390 --> 00:07:05.646
but ...

00:07:05.670 --> 00:07:06.886
(Laughter)

00:07:06.910 --> 00:07:08.196
GK: Say it, Serena, say it!

00:07:08.830 --> 00:07:10.046
SW: Well ...

00:07:10.070 --> 00:07:11.470
(Laughter)

00:07:12.910 --> 00:07:14.126
Yes.

00:07:14.150 --> 00:07:17.206
(Applause)

00:07:17.230 --> 00:07:18.646
GK: But you know what I mean.

00:07:18.670 --> 00:07:22.446
SW: He is very loving and he's very kind,
and my mom says he's very considerate,

00:07:22.470 --> 00:07:24.046
and when she said that to me,

00:07:24.070 --> 00:07:25.766
I was like, you know, he really is,

00:07:25.790 --> 00:07:29.126
and it's the little things that really
make a huge difference in life.

00:07:29.150 --> 00:07:30.406
GK: Like?

00:07:30.430 --> 00:07:31.646
SW: Something simple.

00:07:31.670 --> 00:07:34.526
My fashion company,
we have a show every year,

00:07:34.550 --> 00:07:37.526
so in our show last year,
I was running around like crazy,

00:07:37.550 --> 00:07:39.366
because I do everything for the show,

00:07:39.390 --> 00:07:41.046
and everything for it,

00:07:41.070 --> 00:07:42.766
so I was running around like crazy,

00:07:42.790 --> 00:07:46.166
and he, it was a simple gesture
of this shirt that he had,

00:07:46.190 --> 00:07:49.766
and he just wanted to make sure
that I had the same one,

00:07:49.790 --> 00:07:52.126
and it was -- it's a weird story.

00:07:52.150 --> 00:07:54.126
It was better in person, I promise.

00:07:54.150 --> 00:07:56.126
GK: Was it a wonderful proposal?

00:07:56.150 --> 00:07:58.286
Or was it a Beyoncé song?

00:07:58.310 --> 00:08:00.886
"If you like it then you
ought to put a ring on it"?

00:08:00.910 --> 00:08:02.863
Were you feeling pressure to get married?

00:08:02.887 --> 00:08:04.206
Did you know it was coming?

00:08:04.230 --> 00:08:06.886
SW: Yeah, I actually
never felt pressure to get married

00:08:06.910 --> 00:08:09.166
and I can't say
I'm the marrying type of person.

00:08:09.190 --> 00:08:11.326
I really love my life.

00:08:11.350 --> 00:08:12.886
I love my freedom.

00:08:12.910 --> 00:08:14.446
I heard that kind of changes.

00:08:14.470 --> 00:08:18.526
But I love everything that I do,

00:08:18.550 --> 00:08:20.846
and I love my career,

00:08:20.870 --> 00:08:24.126
and I always felt like I didn't want
anything to interfere with that.

00:08:24.150 --> 00:08:25.966
I've actually been so career-oriented

00:08:25.990 --> 00:08:28.486
and in fact, when he proposed,

00:08:28.510 --> 00:08:29.846
I was almost angry.

00:08:29.870 --> 00:08:31.166
Not almost. I was angry,

00:08:31.190 --> 00:08:34.046
because it was right
in the middle of my training season,

00:08:34.070 --> 00:08:36.206
and I said, "I gotta win
the Australian Open.

00:08:36.230 --> 00:08:37.806
I can't fly to Rome."

00:08:37.830 --> 00:08:39.646
Because he wanted to take me to Rome,

00:08:39.670 --> 00:08:41.366
and I said, "I can't. I gotta win."

00:08:41.390 --> 00:08:42.806
But that's how focused I was.

00:08:42.830 --> 00:08:45.726
GK: This is a girl that says,
"No, I can't go to Rome." OK.

00:08:45.750 --> 00:08:48.486
SW: But I was really focused
on reaching my goals

00:08:48.510 --> 00:08:52.006
and I knew at that point there was
one player that I wanted to pass.

00:08:52.030 --> 00:08:53.886
I wanted to pass Steffi Graf's record,

00:08:53.910 --> 00:08:55.566
and that really meant a lot to me,

00:08:55.590 --> 00:08:57.366
and when I put my mind to something,

00:08:57.390 --> 00:08:59.246
I really am determined to reach it

00:08:59.270 --> 00:09:00.926
no matter what.

00:09:00.950 --> 00:09:02.806
GK: You know, you said that for you --

00:09:02.830 --> 00:09:05.286
I've heard you say
that winning is addictive to you.

00:09:05.310 --> 00:09:06.526
SW: It is.

00:09:06.550 --> 00:09:07.766
GK: What do you mean?

00:09:07.790 --> 00:09:10.526
SW: I feel like winning for me
is superaddictive.

00:09:10.550 --> 00:09:13.246
I feel like once you experience it,

00:09:13.270 --> 00:09:15.526
you always want to get that feeling again,

00:09:15.550 --> 00:09:19.046
and when I won my first championship,
I was only 17 years old,

00:09:19.070 --> 00:09:20.766
but I never forgot that feeling,

00:09:20.790 --> 00:09:23.366
and I feel like every time I win one,

00:09:23.390 --> 00:09:26.046
I want to reach that feeling
of your first championship.

00:09:26.070 --> 00:09:28.526
There's really no feeling
in the world like that.

00:09:28.550 --> 00:09:31.526
And it's like, all these years of training

00:09:31.550 --> 00:09:33.606
and being a little kid and playing,

00:09:33.630 --> 00:09:37.086
and then winning
is a wonderful experience.

00:09:37.110 --> 00:09:41.566
So for me I've always felt
like I loved that feeling,

00:09:41.590 --> 00:09:44.966
and obviously I don't like
the feeling of losing. I feel like --

00:09:44.990 --> 00:09:48.086
GK: No, in fact, people close to you
say you're a very bad loser.

00:09:48.110 --> 00:09:49.406
SW: I'm not the best loser.

00:09:49.430 --> 00:09:51.566
GK: That you're very, very, very bad.

00:09:51.590 --> 00:09:53.846
Listen, no athlete,
no champion likes to lose.

00:09:53.870 --> 00:09:55.086
I get that.

00:09:55.110 --> 00:09:58.966
But they say when it comes to losing,
you are very, very, very bad at it.

00:09:58.990 --> 00:10:00.246
(Laughter)

00:10:00.270 --> 00:10:04.006
SW: I'm number one at losing too,
so you know, that's all I can say.

00:10:04.030 --> 00:10:05.166
(Laughter)

00:10:05.190 --> 00:10:07.806
(Applause)

00:10:07.830 --> 00:10:10.926
GK: I'm always curious about the dynamic
between you and Venus,

00:10:10.950 --> 00:10:13.766
because everybody that knows you
and has followed the story

00:10:13.790 --> 00:10:15.446
knows that you two are very close,

00:10:15.470 --> 00:10:17.926
and you always bring your A game
in whatever you do,

00:10:17.950 --> 00:10:20.046
but I often wonder,
when you're playing her,

00:10:20.070 --> 00:10:23.806
do you bring your A- game
because you want to do something for her

00:10:23.830 --> 00:10:26.846
or do you bring your A++ game
because you want to crush her.

00:10:26.870 --> 00:10:29.286
Is it harder for you
playing her or easier?

00:10:29.310 --> 00:10:31.526
SW: Well, playing Venus
is like playing myself,

00:10:31.550 --> 00:10:34.886
because we grew up playing each other,
we grew up practicing together.

00:10:34.910 --> 00:10:37.526
And it was something
that has been difficult,

00:10:37.550 --> 00:10:39.246
because she's my toughest opponent.

00:10:39.270 --> 00:10:41.006
She's tall, she's fast,

00:10:41.030 --> 00:10:44.126
she hits hard like me, she serves like me.

00:10:44.150 --> 00:10:45.726
It's really like playing a wall.

00:10:45.750 --> 00:10:46.966
GK: She knows you.

00:10:46.990 --> 00:10:49.686
SW: She knows where I'm hitting
the ball before I hit it,

00:10:49.710 --> 00:10:52.126
so it's something that is not very easy,

00:10:52.150 --> 00:10:54.886
but it's really about,
when I go out there,

00:10:54.910 --> 00:10:57.886
I really have to shut down my mind
and I have to say to myself,

00:10:57.910 --> 00:10:59.126
"You know what?

00:10:59.150 --> 00:11:02.926
I'm just playing a great player,
but today I have to be better.

00:11:02.950 --> 00:11:06.366
I don't care who it is,
if it's my sister or it's my friend,

00:11:06.390 --> 00:11:09.406
today is the day I have to show up
and I have to be better

00:11:09.430 --> 00:11:13.606
and I have to want it more
than anyone else at this moment

00:11:13.630 --> 00:11:14.886
anywhere on this world."

00:11:14.910 --> 00:11:18.766
GK: So never on the court
do you fall back for Venus?

00:11:18.790 --> 00:11:22.886
Because, you know,
it was always Venus and Serena.

00:11:22.910 --> 00:11:24.126
SW: Yes.

00:11:24.150 --> 00:11:26.686
GK: And now baby sister
has surpassed older sister.

00:11:26.710 --> 00:11:28.406
Do you feel guilt about that?

00:11:28.430 --> 00:11:30.086
Do you feel joy in that?

00:11:30.110 --> 00:11:31.926
Is that a difficult position for you?

00:11:31.950 --> 00:11:33.646
SW: I don't feel anything in there.

00:11:33.670 --> 00:11:37.126
In my life, it still and forever
is always going to be Venus and Serena.

00:11:37.150 --> 00:11:40.246
She's really love of my life,
she's my best friend,

00:11:40.270 --> 00:11:41.486
she's my soul mate.

00:11:41.510 --> 00:11:42.710
I mean --

00:11:43.390 --> 00:11:45.366
There's pictures of her pushing me,

00:11:45.390 --> 00:11:48.286
really low-quality pictures
or else I would have shared them,

00:11:48.310 --> 00:11:50.686
of her pushing me
in a stroller on a tennis court,

00:11:50.710 --> 00:11:52.246
and she always took care of me.

00:11:52.270 --> 00:11:55.794
I used to spend all of my allowance
money on the ice cream truck and stuff,

00:11:55.818 --> 00:12:00.126
and she would take her money
and give it to me at school

00:12:00.150 --> 00:12:03.086
and make sure I had something to eat
and she would go without,

00:12:03.110 --> 00:12:05.406
and that's the kind of person
she actually is

00:12:05.430 --> 00:12:07.886
since I've always known her.

00:12:07.910 --> 00:12:11.206
So we always have this incredible
respect for each other

00:12:11.230 --> 00:12:12.486
and this incredible love,

00:12:12.510 --> 00:12:15.806
and I think it's important for people
to realize you can be successful

00:12:15.830 --> 00:12:18.086
but you can still have
a wonderful relationship.

00:12:18.110 --> 00:12:19.806
On the court we are mortal enemies,

00:12:19.830 --> 00:12:23.646
but the second we shake hands,
we are best friends again.

00:12:23.670 --> 00:12:28.286
And if I lose, it might be
a day later for me,

00:12:28.310 --> 00:12:29.526
but for Venus --

00:12:29.550 --> 00:12:32.566
(Laughter)

00:12:32.590 --> 00:12:35.446
GK: There's never a time on the court
where you hit the ball

00:12:35.470 --> 00:12:38.886
and say, "That's for seventh grade
when you did the blah blah blah"?

00:12:38.910 --> 00:12:40.646
You never have any moment like that?

00:12:40.670 --> 00:12:42.846
SW: I feel like she should have
those moments,

00:12:42.870 --> 00:12:44.966
because she's never done
anything bad to me,

00:12:44.990 --> 00:12:47.126
but I'm the youngest.
I'm the younger sister.

00:12:47.150 --> 00:12:49.846
GK: Serena, she's never done
anything bad to you? Really?

00:12:49.870 --> 00:12:53.206
I have three sisters.
I can think of some stuff I've done bad.

00:12:53.230 --> 00:12:55.590
SW: Unless she brainwashed me
to forget them.

00:12:56.350 --> 00:12:59.686
GK: No, but the love you have for her
I know is very pure. I know that.

00:12:59.710 --> 00:13:00.966
SW: Yes. GK: I know that.

00:13:00.990 --> 00:13:03.206
SW: We were always brought up
to be superclose,

00:13:03.230 --> 00:13:04.766
and we are incredibly close.

00:13:04.790 --> 00:13:06.006
Not only her.

00:13:06.030 --> 00:13:11.126
I have three other sisters as well,
and we were always so close.

00:13:11.150 --> 00:13:14.006
GK: So before a big match,
the two of you don't get together

00:13:14.030 --> 00:13:17.166
and say, look, we're going
to go out there and -- there's nothing?

00:13:17.190 --> 00:13:19.526
SW: Well, it's funny.
Before the Australian Open,

00:13:19.550 --> 00:13:21.286
we were in the locker room together,

00:13:21.310 --> 00:13:24.846
and I always pick on her, so I pulled out
my camera while she was changing.

00:13:24.870 --> 00:13:28.166
I started taking pictures of her,
which is totally inappropriate,

00:13:28.190 --> 00:13:29.446
but she was so mad at me.

00:13:29.470 --> 00:13:32.246
She's like, "Serena, stop!"
And I was just laughing at her.

00:13:32.270 --> 00:13:36.326
But that's the kind of relationship
that we have, and like I said,

00:13:36.350 --> 00:13:37.926
the second we step on the court,

00:13:37.950 --> 00:13:42.126
it was like, we were
definitely mortal enemies,

00:13:42.150 --> 00:13:46.366
but the second we stepped off,
and moments before, we're just --

00:13:46.390 --> 00:13:48.646
It is what it is,
because at the end of the day,

00:13:48.670 --> 00:13:50.006
she'll always be my sister.

00:13:50.030 --> 00:13:51.846
I'm not going to play Australia in --

00:13:51.870 --> 00:13:53.926
Well, who knows,
I've been playing forever,

00:13:53.950 --> 00:13:56.486
but I don't think
I'll be playing in 50 years, say?

00:13:56.510 --> 00:13:58.006
Let's be safe and say 50 years.

00:13:58.030 --> 00:14:00.966
GK: I don't know, Serena.
There's never been anybody like you.

00:14:00.990 --> 00:14:03.006
When you think about it,
never been anybody

00:14:03.030 --> 00:14:05.846
who has intersected
gender and race the way you have,

00:14:05.870 --> 00:14:08.686
the dominance that you have
and the scrutiny that you have.

00:14:08.710 --> 00:14:11.966
And when you were growing up,
did you say, "I want to be like that"?

00:14:11.990 --> 00:14:13.990
Because now little girls
are looking at you

00:14:14.014 --> 00:14:15.606
saying, "I want to be like that."

00:14:15.630 --> 00:14:17.766
Who was the "I want
to be like that" for you?

00:14:17.790 --> 00:14:20.686
SW: Well, it's interesting,
and I'm glad you brought that up.

00:14:20.710 --> 00:14:23.326
For me, when I grew up,
I always wanted to be the best,

00:14:23.350 --> 00:14:26.686
and I said, if you want to be the best,
you've got to emulate the best.

00:14:26.710 --> 00:14:29.526
So when I started to go on tour
when I was really young,

00:14:29.550 --> 00:14:31.926
I would see Steffi Graf,
I would see Monica Seles,

00:14:31.950 --> 00:14:33.926
and I would even see Pete Sampras,

00:14:33.950 --> 00:14:35.406
and I would see what they did,

00:14:35.430 --> 00:14:37.526
and I noticed that Steffi and Monica

00:14:37.550 --> 00:14:39.966
didn't really talk
to a lot of the other players,

00:14:39.990 --> 00:14:41.726
and they kind of were on their own,

00:14:41.750 --> 00:14:43.166
and they were just so focused

00:14:43.190 --> 00:14:46.286
and I would see Pete Sampras,
the technique that he did,

00:14:46.310 --> 00:14:48.886
and I was like, "I want to do that."

00:14:48.910 --> 00:14:52.126
So I did that, and I felt
that to be the best,

00:14:52.150 --> 00:14:53.726
and if you want to be the best,

00:14:53.750 --> 00:14:55.286
you have to hang around people

00:14:55.310 --> 00:14:57.646
and you have to look at people
that are the best,

00:14:57.670 --> 00:14:59.566
because you're not going to be the best

00:14:59.590 --> 00:15:02.286
if you're looking at someone
that's not at the top level.

00:15:02.310 --> 00:15:04.366
GK: People say
nobody works as hard as you.

00:15:04.390 --> 00:15:06.846
SW: I'm a very hard worker.
GK: That's what I heard.

00:15:06.870 --> 00:15:09.366
SW: People say, "Oh,
she's talented, she's athletic."

00:15:09.390 --> 00:15:11.766
Actually, I wasn't.
I was really small for my age.

00:15:11.790 --> 00:15:13.246
I grew up when I got older,

00:15:13.270 --> 00:15:14.726
and I had to work really hard,

00:15:14.750 --> 00:15:18.006
and I think one of the reasons
why I fight so hard and I work so hard

00:15:18.030 --> 00:15:20.206
is because I was
really, really, really small.

00:15:20.230 --> 00:15:21.926
GK: Yeah.

00:15:21.950 --> 00:15:23.246
You are no longer small.

00:15:23.270 --> 00:15:26.406
SW: No, I'm fully grown now.

00:15:26.430 --> 00:15:29.286
But I was small when I was really young
for whatever reason.

00:15:29.310 --> 00:15:32.606
I think Venus maybe ate all the Wheaties.

00:15:32.630 --> 00:15:35.526
GK: You know, the other thing
people talk about is your body.

00:15:35.550 --> 00:15:39.086
Your body brings men
and women to their knees.

00:15:39.110 --> 00:15:41.086
And I mean in a good way.

00:15:41.110 --> 00:15:42.846
A lot has been made about your body.

00:15:42.870 --> 00:15:48.286
It's a work of art,
it's masculine, it's glorious,

00:15:48.310 --> 00:15:50.326
there's never been anything like it.

00:15:50.350 --> 00:15:53.046
Did you have body issues
when you were growing up?

00:15:53.070 --> 00:15:55.326
Have you always been
comfortable with your body?

00:15:55.350 --> 00:15:58.086
SW: It's interesting, because
when you're a teenage female

00:15:58.110 --> 00:15:59.926
growing up in the public eye,

00:15:59.950 --> 00:16:02.086
it is a lot of scrutiny that you face,

00:16:02.110 --> 00:16:03.926
and as any female that's a teenager,

00:16:03.950 --> 00:16:06.166
I definitely was not
comfortable in my body.

00:16:06.190 --> 00:16:07.526
I didn't like it.

00:16:07.550 --> 00:16:10.366
I didn't understand why I had muscles.

00:16:10.390 --> 00:16:11.846
And I stopped lifting weights.

00:16:11.870 --> 00:16:13.686
I was like, I'm not going to do this.

00:16:13.710 --> 00:16:15.326
But then after I won the US Open,

00:16:15.350 --> 00:16:18.606
I realized that my body helped me
reach goals that I wanted to reach,

00:16:18.630 --> 00:16:20.326
and I wanted to be happy with it,

00:16:20.350 --> 00:16:22.726
and I was so appreciative of it.

00:16:22.750 --> 00:16:23.966
I'm always healthy.

00:16:23.990 --> 00:16:25.806
I'm really fortunate and superblessed,

00:16:25.830 --> 00:16:28.766
and I felt like not only
am I happy with my body,

00:16:28.790 --> 00:16:30.926
but I want other people
and other young girls

00:16:30.950 --> 00:16:33.646
that have experienced
what I've experienced

00:16:33.670 --> 00:16:35.046
to be happy with themselves.

00:16:35.070 --> 00:16:36.326
So whatever people say --

00:16:36.350 --> 00:16:38.766
masculine, whatever,
too much, too little --

00:16:38.790 --> 00:16:42.166
I'm OK with it as long as I love myself.

00:16:42.190 --> 00:16:44.870
(Applause)

00:16:46.830 --> 00:16:48.766
GK: I know you learn a lot from winning,

00:16:48.790 --> 00:16:51.486
but what have you learned from losing?

00:16:51.510 --> 00:16:55.006
SW: I hate to lose, but I think
losing has brought me here today.

00:16:55.030 --> 00:16:58.126
The only reason I am who I am
is because of my losses,

00:16:58.150 --> 00:17:00.526
and some of them are extremely painful,

00:17:00.550 --> 00:17:03.566
but I wouldn't take any of them away,

00:17:03.590 --> 00:17:05.806
because every time I lose,

00:17:05.830 --> 00:17:08.086
it takes a really long time
for me to lose again

00:17:08.110 --> 00:17:09.966
because I learn so much from it.

00:17:09.990 --> 00:17:12.406
And I encourage everyone that I talk to --

00:17:12.430 --> 00:17:15.086
I'm like, listen, if you lose
or if something happens --

00:17:15.110 --> 00:17:17.966
not in sports --
in business or in school --

00:17:17.989 --> 00:17:19.605
learn from it.

00:17:19.630 --> 00:17:21.726
Don't live in the past,
live in the present,

00:17:21.749 --> 00:17:23.966
and don't make the same
mistakes in the future.

00:17:23.989 --> 00:17:26.166
That's something
that I always try to live by.

00:17:26.190 --> 00:17:27.806
GK: Now you're planning a wedding

00:17:27.830 --> 00:17:30.046
and I want to know,
is it a destination wedding

00:17:30.070 --> 00:17:33.446
in the Catskills or Poconos
or are you going to do it in Florida?

00:17:33.469 --> 00:17:35.166
What are you thinking?

00:17:35.190 --> 00:17:37.206
Big or small?

00:17:37.229 --> 00:17:40.085
SW: We're thinking medium size.
We don't want to do too big,

00:17:40.110 --> 00:17:43.366
but then we're like, OK, we can't
say no to this person, this person.

00:17:43.390 --> 00:17:46.046
So we're thinking medium size
and we're just thinking --

00:17:46.070 --> 00:17:49.126
My personality is a lot of fun.
Hopefully you can see that today.

00:17:49.150 --> 00:17:50.566
I'm not too serious.

00:17:50.590 --> 00:17:52.366
GK: And you like to dance.

00:17:52.390 --> 00:17:55.486
And the next chapter
for Serena Williams is what?

00:17:55.510 --> 00:17:57.486
SW: Oh, next for me.

00:17:57.510 --> 00:17:59.446
Obviously I'm going to have a baby

00:17:59.470 --> 00:18:02.446
and I'm going to stay fit
and kind of come back and play tennis

00:18:02.470 --> 00:18:04.206
and keep working on my fashion line.

00:18:04.230 --> 00:18:05.486
That'll be really fun.

00:18:05.510 --> 00:18:07.366
GK: Do you know if it's a boy or girl?

00:18:07.390 --> 00:18:11.086
SW: I don't. I have a feeling
of one or the other.

00:18:11.110 --> 00:18:13.126
It's a 50-50 chance, but I have a feeling.

00:18:13.150 --> 00:18:14.486
GK: Gayle is a unisex name.

00:18:14.510 --> 00:18:17.126
Whatever you and Alexis decide,
we are cheering you on!

00:18:17.150 --> 00:18:19.206
SW: Thank you for that.
GK: You're welcome.

00:18:19.230 --> 00:18:22.206
We are cheering you on, Serena Williams.
SW: Thank you so much.

00:18:22.230 --> 00:18:23.486
Thank you guys.

00:18:23.510 --> 00:18:25.790
(Applause)
