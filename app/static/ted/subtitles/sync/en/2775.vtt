00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:15.451
Getting a college education

00:00:15.475 --> 00:00:17.630
is a 20-year investment.

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:20.205
When you're growing up poor,

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:23.166
you're not accustomed
to thinking that far ahead.

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:26.526
Instead, you're thinking about
where you're going to get your next meal

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.406
and how your family
is going to pay rent that month.

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:32.566
Besides, my parents
and my friends' parents

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:36.230
seemed to be doing just fine
driving taxis and working as janitors.

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:38.966
It wasn't until I was a teenager

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:41.470
when I realized I didn't
want to do those things.

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:45.886
By then, I was two-thirds of the way
through my education,

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:48.230
and it was almost too late
to turn things around.

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:52.150
When you grow up poor,
you want to be rich.

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:54.150
I was no different.

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.486
I'm the second-oldest of seven,

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:58.926
and was raised by a single mother
on government aid

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:00.150
in Queens, New York.

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.806
By virtue of growing up low-income,

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:05.166
my siblings and I went
to some of New York City's

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:06.710
most struggling public schools.

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.550
I had over 60 absences
when I was in seventh grade,

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.430
because I didn't feel like going to class.

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:17.086
My high school had
a 55 percent graduation rate,

00:01:17.109 --> 00:01:18.406
and even worse,

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:20.726
only 20 percent of the kids graduating

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:21.950
were college-ready.

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:25.246
When I actually did make it to college,

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:26.686
I told my friend Brennan

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:30.406
how our teachers would always ask us
to raise our hands

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:32.430
if we were going to college.

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:35.286
I was taken aback when Brennan said,

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.990
"Karim, I've never been asked
that question before."

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:41.846
It was always, "What college
are you going to?"

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:43.806
Just the way that question is phrased

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:46.590
made it unacceptable for him
not to have gone to college.

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:50.150
Nowadays I get asked a different question.

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:53.110
"How were you able to make it out?"

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:56.270
For years I said I was lucky,

00:01:57.470 --> 00:01:58.670
but it's not just luck.

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:02.006
When my older brother and I
graduated from high school

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:03.286
at the very same time

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:05.526
and he later dropped out
of a two-year college,

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:08.006
I wanted to understand why he dropped out

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:09.230
and I kept studying.

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:13.766
It wasn't until I got to Cornell
as a Presidential Research Scholar

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:17.526
that I started to learn about
the very real educational consequences

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:20.325
of being raised by a single mother
on government aid

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:22.150
and attending the schools that I did.

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:26.910
That's when my older brother's trajectory
began to make complete sense to me.

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:31.806
I also learned that our most admirable
education reformers,

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:35.486
people like Arne Duncan,
the former US Secretary of Education,

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:38.206
or Wendy Kopp, the founder
of Teach For America,

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:41.030
had never attended an inner city
public school like I had.

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:45.486
So much of our education reform
is driven by a sympathetic approach,

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:46.766
where people are saying,

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:49.806
"Let's go and help
these poor inner city kids,

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:51.830
or these poor black and Latino kids,"

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:54.846
instead of an empathetic approach,

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:58.286
where someone like me, who had grown up
in this environment, could say,

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:00.526
"I know the adversities that you're facing

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:02.390
and I want to help you overcome them."

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:06.406
Today when I get questions
about how I made it out,

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:08.926
I share that one of the biggest reasons

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:11.030
is that I wasn't ashamed to ask for help.

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:14.606
In a typical middle class
or affluent household,

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:16.406
if a kid is struggling,

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:20.366
there's a good chance that a parent
or a teacher will come to their rescue

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:22.326
even if they don't ask for help.

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:24.486
However, if that same kid
is growing up poor

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:25.750
and doesn't ask for help,

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:28.710
there's a good chance
that no one will help them.

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:32.030
There are virtually
no social safety nets available.

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:34.686
So seven years ago,

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:37.526
I started to reform
our public education system

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:39.870
shaped by my firsthand perspective.

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:42.682
And I started with summer school.

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:47.446
Research tells us that two-thirds
of the achievement gap,

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:49.806
which is the disparity
in educational attainment

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:52.006
between rich kids and poor kids

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:54.166
or black kids and white kids,

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:56.870
could be directly attributed
to the summer learning loss.

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:00.606
In low-income neighborhoods,
kids forget almost three months

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:02.686
of what they learned
during the school year

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:04.046
over the summer.

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:05.686
They return to school in the fall,

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:07.766
and their teachers
spend another two months

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:09.206
reteaching them old material.

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:10.726
That's five months.

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:13.366
The school year in the United States
is only 10 months.

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:16.006
If kids lose five months of learning
every single year,

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:17.510
that's half of their education.

00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:19.470
Half.

00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:23.390
If kids were in school over the summer,
then they couldn't regress,

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:26.470
but traditional summer school
is poorly designed.

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:29.126
For kids it feels like punishment,

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:31.190
and for teachers
it feels like babysitting.

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:36.486
But how can we expect principals
to execute an effective summer program

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:38.966
when the school year
ends the last week of June

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:41.350
and then summer school starts
just one week later?

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:44.686
There just isn't enough time
to find the right people,

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:45.966
sort out the logistics,

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:50.190
and design an engaging curriculum
that excites kids and teachers.

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:55.886
But what if we created a program
over the summer

00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:59.606
that empowered teachers
as teaching coaches

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:01.630
to develop aspiring educators?

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:05.606
What if we empowered
college-educated role models

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:06.910
as teaching fellows

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:10.246
to help kids realize
their college ambitions?

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:12.526
What if empowered high-achieving kids

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:15.966
as mentors to tutor their younger peers

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:18.310
and inspire them
to invest in their education?

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:23.526
What if we empowered all kids as scholars,

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:26.766
asked them what colleges
they were going to,

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:29.750
designed a summer school
they want to attend

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:33.086
to completely eliminate
the summer learning loss

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:35.310
and close two-thirds
of the achievement gap?

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:42.046
By this summer, my team will have served
over 4,000 low-income children,

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:45.006
trained over 300 aspiring teachers

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:47.326
and created more than 1,000 seasonal jobs

00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:50.390
across some of New York City's
most disadvantaged neighborhoods.

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:54.950
(Applause)

00:05:56.990 --> 00:05:59.326
And our kids are succeeding.

00:05:59.350 --> 00:06:01.326
Two years of independent evaluations

00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:04.286
tell us that our kids
eliminate the summer learning loss

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:06.486
and make growth of one month in math

00:06:06.510 --> 00:06:07.750
and two months in reading.

00:06:08.350 --> 00:06:11.846
So instead of returning to school
in the fall three months behind,

00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:14.510
they now go back four months ahead in math

00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:17.766
and five months ahead in reading.

00:06:17.790 --> 00:06:21.190
(Applause)

00:06:24.910 --> 00:06:26.846
Ten years ago, if you would have told me

00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:31.046
that I'd graduate in the top 10 percent
of my class from an Ivy League institution

00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:35.046
and have an opportunity to make a dent
on our public education system

00:06:35.070 --> 00:06:38.110
just by tackling two months
of the calendar year,

00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:40.566
I would have said,

00:06:40.590 --> 00:06:42.710
"Nah. No way."

00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:45.366
What's even more exciting

00:06:45.390 --> 00:06:48.566
is that if we can prevent
five months of lost time

00:06:48.590 --> 00:06:50.550
just by redesigning two months,

00:06:51.630 --> 00:06:54.286
imagine the possibilities
that we can unlock

00:06:54.310 --> 00:06:56.870
by tackling the rest of the calendar year.

00:06:58.310 --> 00:06:59.526
Thank you.

00:06:59.550 --> 00:07:04.211
(Applause)
