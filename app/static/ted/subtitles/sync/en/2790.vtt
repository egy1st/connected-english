(Music)

00:00:17.879 --> 00:00:20.301
Sophie Hawley-Weld: OK,
you don't have to stand up,

00:00:20.325 --> 00:00:22.044
but ...

00:00:22.068 --> 00:00:24.352
we can see you really clearly --

00:00:24.376 --> 00:00:25.416
(Laughter)

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:26.913
So you have to dance with us.

00:00:26.937 --> 00:00:29.343
And we have this, like,

00:00:29.367 --> 00:00:31.853
choreographed dance thing
that we're about to do --

00:00:31.877 --> 00:00:33.088
Betta Lemme: Really easy.

00:00:33.112 --> 00:00:35.929
SHW: And we're going to flick
our wrists like this,

00:00:35.953 --> 00:00:37.589
and you're going to do it with us.

00:00:37.613 --> 00:00:39.584
And you can also stand up.

00:00:39.608 --> 00:00:43.134
(Music)

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:48.160
(Sings) I know I did not raise a wrist

00:00:48.184 --> 00:00:51.747
(Both sing) I know I did not capture it

00:00:52.112 --> 00:00:53.278
It came, it came,

00:00:53.302 --> 00:00:54.468
it went, it went

00:00:54.492 --> 00:00:56.252
It conquered quick

00:00:56.276 --> 00:00:59.855
I was there and then I quit

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:01.171
Awoo!

00:01:01.195 --> 00:01:03.868
I know I did not raise a wrist

00:01:03.892 --> 00:01:07.713
I know I did not capture it

00:01:07.737 --> 00:01:08.897
It came, it came,

00:01:08.921 --> 00:01:10.087
it went, it went

00:01:10.111 --> 00:01:11.871
It conquered quick

00:01:11.895 --> 00:01:15.230
I was there and then I quit

00:01:15.254 --> 00:01:17.076
Awoo!

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.568

00:01:18.592 --> 00:01:22.615
(Music)

00:01:22.639 --> 00:01:24.349
SHW: We have another one coming up.

00:01:24.373 --> 00:01:26.107
It's a little finger-pointing dance.

00:01:26.131 --> 00:01:29.131
(Music)

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:42.365
The people sitting down,

00:01:42.389 --> 00:01:44.398
I want to see your fingers pointing.

00:01:44.828 --> 00:01:46.169
Yeah!

00:01:46.736 --> 00:01:50.675
(Sings) I know I did not raise a wrist

00:01:50.699 --> 00:01:54.558
(Both sing) I know I did not capture it

00:01:54.582 --> 00:01:55.749
It came, it came,

00:01:55.773 --> 00:01:56.924
it went, it went

00:01:56.948 --> 00:01:58.735
It conquered quick

00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:02.160
I was there and then I quit

00:02:02.765 --> 00:02:07.565
Aaaa ...

00:02:09.116 --> 00:02:10.266
(Applause)

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:11.512
Awoo!

00:02:11.536 --> 00:02:13.198

00:02:13.222 --> 00:02:15.540
(Clapping to the beat)

00:02:20.008 --> 00:02:24.014
(Music)

00:02:26.215 --> 00:02:31.962
Aaaa ...

00:02:32.265 --> 00:02:34.067
SHW: (Speaks) Alright, hand flick.

00:02:34.091 --> 00:02:37.493
(Both sing) I know
I did not raise a wrist

00:02:37.517 --> 00:02:41.331
I know I did not capture it

00:02:41.355 --> 00:02:42.512
It came, it came,

00:02:42.536 --> 00:02:43.694
it went, it went

00:02:43.718 --> 00:02:45.469
It conquered quick

00:02:45.493 --> 00:02:48.818
I was there and then I quit

00:02:49.233 --> 00:02:53.178
I know I did not raise a wrist

00:02:53.202 --> 00:02:57.001
I know I did not capture it

00:02:57.025 --> 00:02:58.175
It came, it came,

00:02:58.199 --> 00:02:59.351
it went, it went

00:02:59.375 --> 00:03:01.141
It conquered quick

00:03:01.165 --> 00:03:05.196
I was there and then I quit

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:08.647
(Music)

00:03:08.671 --> 00:03:11.873

than I thought you'd be.

00:03:11.897 --> 00:03:13.115

00:03:13.139 --> 00:03:17.105
