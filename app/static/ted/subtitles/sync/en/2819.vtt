00:00:13.165 --> 00:00:16.446
If you've been thinking about US politics

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:19.901
and trying to make sense of it
for the last year or so,

00:00:20.957 --> 00:00:24.616
you might have hit on something
like the following three propositions:

00:00:25.196 --> 00:00:29.886
one, US partisanship
has never been so bad before;

00:00:31.362 --> 00:00:32.918
two,

00:00:32.942 --> 00:00:36.716
for the first time,
it's geographically spatialized --

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:40.687
we're divided between the coasts,
which want to look outwards,

00:00:40.711 --> 00:00:43.828
and the center of the country,
which wants to look inwards;

00:00:43.852 --> 00:00:45.131
and third,

00:00:45.155 --> 00:00:47.671
there's nothing we can do about it.

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:53.061
I'm here to today to say
that all three of these propositions,

00:00:53.085 --> 00:00:55.089
all of which sound reasonable,

00:00:55.113 --> 00:00:56.327
are not true.

00:00:57.225 --> 00:00:58.426
In fact,

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:01.771
our US partisanship goes all the way back

00:01:01.795 --> 00:01:04.327
to the very beginning of the republic.

00:01:05.577 --> 00:01:10.660
It was geographically spatialized
in almost eerily the same way

00:01:10.684 --> 00:01:11.977
that it is today,

00:01:12.001 --> 00:01:14.810
and it often has been
throughout US history.

00:01:15.972 --> 00:01:17.122
And last,

00:01:17.146 --> 00:01:19.520
and by far most importantly,

00:01:19.544 --> 00:01:23.846
we actually have
an extraordinary mechanism

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:29.008
that's designed to help us manage
factional disagreement and partisanship.

00:01:29.763 --> 00:01:32.572
That technology is the Constitution.

00:01:33.411 --> 00:01:39.305
And this is an evolving, subtly,
supplely designed entity

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:40.869
that has the specific purpose

00:01:40.893 --> 00:01:44.378
of teaching us how to manage
factional disagreement

00:01:44.402 --> 00:01:46.296
where it's possible to do that,

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:50.001
and giving us techniques
for overcoming that disagreement

00:01:50.025 --> 00:01:51.336
when that's possible.

00:01:52.101 --> 00:01:54.612
Now, in order to tell you the story,

00:01:54.636 --> 00:01:58.900
I want to go back
to a pivotal moment in US history,

00:01:58.924 --> 00:02:00.079
and that is the moment

00:02:00.103 --> 00:02:03.650
when factional disagreement
and partisanship was born.

00:02:04.127 --> 00:02:05.946
There actually was a birth moment --

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:09.181
a moment in US history
when partisanship snapped into place.

00:02:10.931 --> 00:02:15.949
The person who's at the core
of that story is James Madison.

00:02:16.342 --> 00:02:19.071
And at the moment that this began,

00:02:19.095 --> 00:02:21.580
James Madison was riding high.

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:26.801
He himself was the Einstein
of not only the US Constitution,

00:02:26.825 --> 00:02:29.290
but of constitutional thought
more globally,

00:02:29.314 --> 00:02:31.343
and, to give him his due,

00:02:31.367 --> 00:02:32.572
he knew it.

00:02:33.475 --> 00:02:36.569
In a period of time of just three years,

00:02:36.593 --> 00:02:38.951
from 1785 to 1788,

00:02:38.975 --> 00:02:45.374
he had conceived, theorized,
designed, passed and gotten ratified

00:02:45.398 --> 00:02:46.939
the US Constitution.

00:02:46.963 --> 00:02:49.200
And just to give you
some sense of the enormity

00:02:49.224 --> 00:02:51.296
of what that accomplishment actually was,

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:54.215
although Madison
couldn't have known it at the time,

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:59.550
today that same constitutional technology
that he invented is still in use

00:02:59.574 --> 00:03:01.255
not only in the US,

00:03:01.279 --> 00:03:02.763
but, 230 years later,

00:03:02.787 --> 00:03:05.130
in places like Canada,

00:03:05.154 --> 00:03:06.974
India,

00:03:06.998 --> 00:03:08.521
South Africa,

00:03:08.545 --> 00:03:10.143
Brazil.

00:03:10.167 --> 00:03:13.047
So in an extraordinary range
of contexts all over the world,

00:03:13.071 --> 00:03:15.151
this technology is still the dominant,

00:03:15.175 --> 00:03:18.434
most used, most effective technology
to manage governance.

00:03:20.146 --> 00:03:22.087
In that moment,

00:03:22.111 --> 00:03:25.683
Madison believed that,
having solved this problem,

00:03:25.707 --> 00:03:27.322
the country would run smoothly,

00:03:27.346 --> 00:03:29.154
and that he had designed a technology

00:03:29.178 --> 00:03:32.224
that would minimize
the results of factions

00:03:32.248 --> 00:03:34.420
so there would be no political parties.

00:03:34.444 --> 00:03:36.953
Remarkably, he thought
he had designed a constitution

00:03:36.977 --> 00:03:38.676
that was against political parties

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:40.626
and would make them unnecessary.

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:42.556
He had gotten an enormous degree of help

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:46.423
in the final marketing phase
of his constitutional project

00:03:46.447 --> 00:03:49.515
from a man you may have heard of,
called Alexander Hamilton.

00:03:50.643 --> 00:03:53.901
Now, Hamilton was everything
Madison was not.

00:03:54.464 --> 00:03:58.855
He was passionate,
where Madison was restrained.

00:03:58.879 --> 00:04:00.727
He was pansexual,

00:04:00.751 --> 00:04:03.591
where Madison didn't speak
to a woman except for once

00:04:03.615 --> 00:04:05.205
until he was 42 years old,

00:04:05.229 --> 00:04:08.588
and then married Dolley
and lived happily ever after for 40 years.

00:04:08.906 --> 00:04:10.509
(Laughter)

00:04:10.533 --> 00:04:11.693
To put it bluntly,

00:04:11.717 --> 00:04:13.124
Hamilton's the kind of person

00:04:13.148 --> 00:04:15.377
about whom you would write
a hip-hop musical --

00:04:15.401 --> 00:04:16.428
(Laughter)

00:04:16.452 --> 00:04:18.040
and Madison is the kind of person

00:04:18.064 --> 00:04:20.469
about whom you would not write
a hip-hop musical.

00:04:20.493 --> 00:04:21.513
(Laughter)

00:04:21.537 --> 00:04:23.537
Or indeed, a musical of any kind at all.

00:04:24.522 --> 00:04:25.691
But together,

00:04:25.715 --> 00:04:27.787
they had become a rather unlikely pairing,

00:04:27.811 --> 00:04:29.860
and they had produced
the Federalist Papers,

00:04:29.884 --> 00:04:31.956
which offered a justification

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:33.145
and, as I mentioned,

00:04:33.169 --> 00:04:35.405
a marketing plan for the Constitution,

00:04:35.429 --> 00:04:39.158
which had been wildly effective
and wildly successful.

00:04:40.679 --> 00:04:42.449
Once the new government was in place,

00:04:42.473 --> 00:04:44.620
Hamilton became Secretary of the Treasury,

00:04:44.644 --> 00:04:47.334
and he had a very specific idea in mind.

00:04:47.358 --> 00:04:48.511
And that was

00:04:48.535 --> 00:04:51.506
to do for financial institutions
and infrastructure

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:54.995
exactly what Madison had done
for constitutions.

00:04:55.815 --> 00:04:57.994
Again, his contemporaries all knew it.

00:04:58.018 --> 00:04:59.852
One of them told Madison,

00:04:59.876 --> 00:05:01.629
who can't have liked it very much,

00:05:01.653 --> 00:05:04.797
that Hamilton was the Newton
of infrastructure.

00:05:05.544 --> 00:05:07.701
The idea was pretty straightforward.

00:05:07.725 --> 00:05:10.426
Hamilton would give
the United States a national bank,

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:14.526
a permanent national debt --

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:16.758
he said it would be
"immortal," his phrase --

00:05:17.817 --> 00:05:23.396
and a manufacturing policy
that would enable trade and manufacturing

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:24.978
rather than agriculture,

00:05:25.002 --> 00:05:28.838
which was where the country's primary
wealth had historically been.

00:05:29.608 --> 00:05:31.932
Madison went utterly ballistic.

00:05:32.754 --> 00:05:35.785
And in this pivotal, critical decision,

00:05:35.809 --> 00:05:40.056
instead of just telling the world
that his old friend Hamilton was wrong

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:42.779
and was adopting the wrong policies,

00:05:42.803 --> 00:05:44.565
he actually began to argue

00:05:44.589 --> 00:05:47.690
that Hamilton's ideas
were unconstitutional --

00:05:47.714 --> 00:05:50.684
that they violated the very nature
of the Constitution

00:05:50.708 --> 00:05:52.933
that the two of them had drafted together.

00:05:54.467 --> 00:05:57.510
Hamilton responded
the way you would expect.

00:05:58.344 --> 00:06:03.405
He declared Madison to be
his "personal and political enemy" --

00:06:03.429 --> 00:06:04.974
these are his words.

00:06:04.998 --> 00:06:08.957
So these two founders who had been
such close friends and such close allies

00:06:08.981 --> 00:06:10.223
and such partners,

00:06:10.247 --> 00:06:13.193
then began to produce enmity.

00:06:13.932 --> 00:06:16.180
And they did it in the good,
old-fashioned way.

00:06:16.204 --> 00:06:18.050
First, they founded political parties.

00:06:18.074 --> 00:06:21.658
Madison created a party originally called
the Democratic Republican Party --

00:06:21.682 --> 00:06:22.892
"Republican" for short --

00:06:22.916 --> 00:06:25.751
and Hamilton created a party
called the Federalist Party.

00:06:26.643 --> 00:06:30.290
Those two parties adopted
positions on national politics

00:06:30.314 --> 00:06:33.031
that were extreme and exaggerated.

00:06:33.055 --> 00:06:34.789
To give you a clear example:

00:06:34.813 --> 00:06:36.361
Madison, who had always believed

00:06:36.385 --> 00:06:39.474
that the country would have
some manufacturing and some trade

00:06:39.498 --> 00:06:41.068
and some agriculture,

00:06:41.092 --> 00:06:43.300
began attacking Hamilton

00:06:43.324 --> 00:06:46.698
as a kind of tool of the financial markets

00:06:47.522 --> 00:06:52.385
whom Hamilton himself intended
to put in charge of the country.

00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:54.150
That was an overstatement,

00:06:54.174 --> 00:06:56.294
but it was something
Madison came to believe.

00:06:56.318 --> 00:06:58.187
He also attacked city life,

00:06:58.211 --> 00:07:01.016
and he said that the coasts were corrupt,

00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:03.671
and what people needed to do
was to look inwards

00:07:03.695 --> 00:07:05.408
to the center of the country,

00:07:05.432 --> 00:07:09.245
to farmers, who were the essence
of Republican virtue,

00:07:09.269 --> 00:07:12.601
and they should go back to the values
that had made American great,

00:07:13.145 --> 00:07:15.963
specifically the values of the Revolution,

00:07:15.987 --> 00:07:18.488
and those were the values of low taxes,

00:07:18.512 --> 00:07:19.673
agriculture

00:07:19.697 --> 00:07:20.957
and less trade.

00:07:21.561 --> 00:07:26.238
Hamilton responded to this
by saying that Madison was naïve,

00:07:26.262 --> 00:07:28.406
that he was childish,

00:07:28.430 --> 00:07:30.871
and that his goal was
to turn the United States

00:07:30.895 --> 00:07:32.690
into a primitive autarchy,

00:07:32.714 --> 00:07:36.549
self-reliant and completely ineffectual
on the global scale.

00:07:36.573 --> 00:07:38.084
(Laughter)

00:07:38.108 --> 00:07:39.813
They both meant it,

00:07:39.837 --> 00:07:42.192
and there was some truth
to each of their claims,

00:07:42.216 --> 00:07:46.558
because each side was grossly exaggerating
the views of the other

00:07:46.582 --> 00:07:48.428
in order to fight their war.

00:07:49.052 --> 00:07:51.185
They founded newspapers,

00:07:51.209 --> 00:07:53.154
and so for the first time in US history,

00:07:53.178 --> 00:07:58.138
the news that people received
came entirely through the lens

00:07:58.162 --> 00:08:00.792
of either the Republican
or the Federalist party.

00:08:03.209 --> 00:08:04.613
How does this end?

00:08:05.401 --> 00:08:09.635
Well, as it turned out,
the Constitution did its work.

00:08:10.089 --> 00:08:13.149
But it did its work in surprising ways

00:08:13.173 --> 00:08:17.276
that Madison himself
had not fully anticipated.

00:08:18.977 --> 00:08:20.888
First, there was a series of elections.

00:08:21.388 --> 00:08:23.979
And the first two times out of the box,

00:08:24.003 --> 00:08:27.844
the Federalists destroyed the Republicans.

00:08:29.010 --> 00:08:31.240
Madison was astonished.

00:08:32.128 --> 00:08:33.808
Of course, he blamed the press.

00:08:33.832 --> 00:08:36.170
(Laughter)

00:08:36.194 --> 00:08:38.493
And in a rather innovative view --

00:08:38.517 --> 00:08:41.703
Madison never failed to innovate
when he thought about anything --

00:08:41.727 --> 00:08:44.392
he said the reason
that the press was so pro-Federalist

00:08:44.416 --> 00:08:47.791
is that the advertisers
were all Federalists,

00:08:47.815 --> 00:08:52.542
because they were traders on the coasts
who got their capital from Britain,

00:08:52.566 --> 00:08:54.529
which Federalism was in bed with.

00:08:55.946 --> 00:08:57.604
That was his initial explanation.

00:08:58.382 --> 00:09:00.430
But despite the fact that the Federalists,

00:09:00.454 --> 00:09:01.605
once in power,

00:09:01.629 --> 00:09:06.854
actually enacted laws that criminalized
criticism of the government --

00:09:06.878 --> 00:09:08.751
that happened in the United States --

00:09:09.896 --> 00:09:11.661
nevertheless,

00:09:11.685 --> 00:09:13.372
the Republicans fought back,

00:09:13.396 --> 00:09:16.699
and Madison began to emphasize
the freedom of speech,

00:09:16.723 --> 00:09:19.211
which he had built
into the Bill of Rights,

00:09:19.235 --> 00:09:21.370
and the capacity of civil society

00:09:21.394 --> 00:09:22.760
to organize.

00:09:22.784 --> 00:09:25.406
And sure enough, nationally,

00:09:25.430 --> 00:09:29.793
small local groups -- they were called
Democratic-Republican Societies --

00:09:29.817 --> 00:09:34.462
began to form and protest
against Federalist-dominated hegemony.

00:09:35.286 --> 00:09:40.523
Eventually, the Republicans managed
to win a national election --

00:09:40.547 --> 00:09:42.006
that was in 1800.

00:09:42.735 --> 00:09:44.955
Madison became the Secretary of State,

00:09:44.979 --> 00:09:47.669
his friend and mentor Jefferson
became president,

00:09:47.693 --> 00:09:49.915
and they actually, over time,

00:09:49.939 --> 00:09:54.394
managed to put the Federalists
completely out of business.

00:09:54.815 --> 00:09:56.101
That was their goal.

00:09:57.976 --> 00:09:59.929
Now, why did that happen?

00:10:00.818 --> 00:10:04.639
It happened because in the structure
of the Constitution

00:10:04.663 --> 00:10:08.423
were several features
that actually managed faction

00:10:08.447 --> 00:10:10.977
the way there were supposed to do
in the first place.

00:10:11.001 --> 00:10:12.256
What were those?

00:10:12.665 --> 00:10:14.941
One -- most important of all --

00:10:14.965 --> 00:10:16.779
the freedom of speech.

00:10:16.803 --> 00:10:18.960
This was an innovative idea at the time.

00:10:18.984 --> 00:10:21.243
Namely, that if you were out of power,

00:10:21.267 --> 00:10:24.025
you could still say
that the government was terrible.

00:10:25.110 --> 00:10:26.270
Two,

00:10:27.040 --> 00:10:28.802
civil society organization.

00:10:29.201 --> 00:10:33.315
The capacity to put together
private groups, individuals,

00:10:33.339 --> 00:10:34.946
political parties and others

00:10:34.970 --> 00:10:38.103
who would organize to try to bring
about fundamental change.

00:10:40.083 --> 00:10:44.280
Perhaps most significantly
was the separation of powers --

00:10:44.304 --> 00:10:46.783
an extraordinary component
of the Constitution.

00:10:47.289 --> 00:10:49.237
The thing about the separation of powers

00:10:49.261 --> 00:10:51.735
is that it did then and it does now,

00:10:51.759 --> 00:10:55.268
drive governance to the center.

00:10:56.276 --> 00:10:59.588
You can get elected to office
in the United States

00:10:59.612 --> 00:11:01.580
with help from the periphery,

00:11:01.604 --> 00:11:02.884
right or left.

00:11:03.626 --> 00:11:04.886
It turns out,

00:11:04.910 --> 00:11:10.249
you actually can't govern
unless you bring on board the center.

00:11:11.130 --> 00:11:14.848
There are midterm elections
that come incredibly fast

00:11:14.872 --> 00:11:16.801
after a presidency begins.

00:11:17.927 --> 00:11:20.410
Those drive presidents towards the center.

00:11:21.318 --> 00:11:25.623
There's a structure in which
the president, in fact, does not rule

00:11:25.647 --> 00:11:27.058
or even govern,

00:11:27.082 --> 00:11:31.127
but can only propose laws
which other people have to agree with --

00:11:31.722 --> 00:11:34.304
another feature that tends
to drive presidents

00:11:34.328 --> 00:11:36.086
who actually want to get things done

00:11:36.110 --> 00:11:37.300
to the center.

00:11:37.703 --> 00:11:41.935
And a glance at the newspapers today
will reveal to you

00:11:41.959 --> 00:11:45.751
that these principles are still
completely in operation.

00:11:46.501 --> 00:11:48.631
No matter how a president gets elected,

00:11:48.655 --> 00:11:51.433
the president cannot get anything done

00:11:52.155 --> 00:11:55.841
unless the president first of all
follows the rules of the Constitution,

00:11:55.865 --> 00:11:57.021
because if not,

00:11:57.045 --> 00:12:00.342
the courts will stand up,
as indeed has sometimes occurred,

00:12:00.366 --> 00:12:03.226
not only recently,
but in the past, in US history.

00:12:03.250 --> 00:12:04.403
And furthermore,

00:12:04.427 --> 00:12:05.997
the president needs people,

00:12:06.021 --> 00:12:09.093
elected officials who know
they need to win election

00:12:09.117 --> 00:12:10.562
from centrist voters,

00:12:10.586 --> 00:12:14.811
also to back his or her policies
in order to pass laws.

00:12:15.712 --> 00:12:18.287
Without it, nothing much happens.

00:12:20.015 --> 00:12:23.587
The takeaway of this brief excursus

00:12:23.611 --> 00:12:27.761
into the history of partisanship,
then, is the following:

00:12:29.648 --> 00:12:31.293
partisanship is real;

00:12:32.198 --> 00:12:33.612
it's profound;

00:12:34.159 --> 00:12:36.591
it's extraordinarily powerful,

00:12:36.615 --> 00:12:38.405
and it's terribly upsetting.

00:12:39.645 --> 00:12:45.332
But the design of the Constitution
is greater than partisanship.

00:12:46.428 --> 00:12:50.861
It enables us to manage partisanship
when that's possible,

00:12:50.885 --> 00:12:56.861
and it enables us actually
to overcome partisan division

00:12:56.885 --> 00:12:58.533
and produce compromise,

00:12:58.557 --> 00:13:00.802
when and only when that is possible.

00:13:03.233 --> 00:13:06.735
A technology like that
is a technology that worked

00:13:06.759 --> 00:13:08.476
for the founders,

00:13:08.500 --> 00:13:10.941
it worked for their grandchildren,

00:13:12.234 --> 00:13:14.442
it didn't work at the moment
of the Civil War,

00:13:14.466 --> 00:13:16.380
but then it started working again.

00:13:16.815 --> 00:13:19.116
And it worked for our grandparents,

00:13:19.140 --> 00:13:20.694
our parents,

00:13:20.718 --> 00:13:24.136
and it's going to work for us.

00:13:25.618 --> 00:13:30.074
(Applause)

00:13:30.875 --> 00:13:32.977
So what you should do is really simple.

00:13:33.919 --> 00:13:35.652
Stand up for what you believe in,

00:13:36.537 --> 00:13:39.743
support the organizations
that you care about,

00:13:39.767 --> 00:13:42.604
speak out on the issues
that matter to you,

00:13:43.575 --> 00:13:45.406
get involved,

00:13:45.430 --> 00:13:46.945
make change,

00:13:46.969 --> 00:13:48.864
express you opinion,

00:13:48.888 --> 00:13:52.739
and do it with respect
and knowledge and confidence

00:13:52.763 --> 00:13:55.617
that it's only by working together

00:13:55.641 --> 00:14:00.212
that the constitutional technology
can do the job that it is designed to do.

00:14:01.147 --> 00:14:02.840
Stand up for what you believe,

00:14:02.864 --> 00:14:04.963
but take a deep breath while you do it.

00:14:05.508 --> 00:14:08.563
It's going to be OK.

00:14:09.217 --> 00:14:10.576
Thanks.

00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:15.254
(Applause)
