WEBVTT

00:00:19.415 --> 00:00:21.215
(Laughter)

00:00:24.653 --> 00:00:25.803
(Laughter)

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:38.190
That's SpotMini.

00:00:38.214 --> 00:00:39.832
He'll be back in a little while.

00:00:39.856 --> 00:00:41.020
I --

00:00:41.044 --> 00:00:44.882
(Applause)

00:00:45.802 --> 00:00:47.539
I love building robots.

00:00:48.749 --> 00:00:51.201
And my long-term goal is to build robots

00:00:51.225 --> 00:00:53.307
that can do what people and animals do.

00:00:54.294 --> 00:00:57.393
And there's three things in particular

00:00:57.871 --> 00:00:59.574
that we're interested in.

00:01:00.338 --> 00:01:03.640
One is balance and dynamic mobility,

00:01:03.664 --> 00:01:06.294
the second one is mobile manipulation,

00:01:06.318 --> 00:01:08.683
and the third one is mobile perception.

00:01:09.274 --> 00:01:12.185
So, dynamic mobility and balance --

00:01:12.209 --> 00:01:13.846
I'm going to do a demo for you.

00:01:15.429 --> 00:01:16.976
I'm standing here, balancing.

00:01:18.451 --> 00:01:21.165
I can see you're not very impressed.
OK, how about now?

00:01:21.189 --> 00:01:22.349
(Laughter)

00:01:22.373 --> 00:01:23.566
How about now?

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:25.633
(Applause)

00:01:26.379 --> 00:01:30.752
Those simple capabilities mean that people
can go almost anywhere on earth,

00:01:30.776 --> 00:01:32.428
on any kind of terrain.

00:01:32.452 --> 00:01:35.107
We want to capture that for robots.

00:01:36.102 --> 00:01:37.494
What about manipulation?

00:01:37.944 --> 00:01:39.660
I'm holding this clicker in my hand;

00:01:39.684 --> 00:01:40.976
I'm not even looking at it,

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.730
and I can manipulate it
without any problem.

00:01:43.754 --> 00:01:46.394
But even more important,

00:01:46.418 --> 00:01:51.578
I can move my body while I hold
the manipulator, the clicker,

00:01:52.445 --> 00:01:54.619
and stabilize and coordinate my body,

00:01:54.643 --> 00:01:56.165
and I can even walk around.

00:01:56.697 --> 00:01:59.595
And that means
I can move around in the world

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:02.921
and expand the range
of my arms and my hands

00:02:02.945 --> 00:02:05.114
and really be able to handle
almost anything.

00:02:05.138 --> 00:02:06.730
So that's mobile manipulation.

00:02:07.784 --> 00:02:09.559
And all of you can do this.

00:02:09.583 --> 00:02:11.500
Third is perception.

00:02:11.524 --> 00:02:14.789
I'm looking at a room
with over 1,000 people in it,

00:02:14.813 --> 00:02:19.588
and my amazing visual system
can see every one of you --

00:02:19.612 --> 00:02:21.573
you're all stable in space,

00:02:21.597 --> 00:02:22.916
even when I move my head,

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:24.486
even when I move around.

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:28.289
That kind of mobile perception
is really important for robots

00:02:28.313 --> 00:02:29.957
that are going to move and act

00:02:29.981 --> 00:02:31.194
out in the world.

00:02:32.195 --> 00:02:34.473
I'm going to give you
a little status report

00:02:34.497 --> 00:02:38.343
on where we are in developing robots
toward these ends.

00:02:40.668 --> 00:02:45.208
The first three robots are all
dynamically stabilized robots.

00:02:45.232 --> 00:02:47.880
This one goes back
a little over 10 years ago --

00:02:47.904 --> 00:02:49.072
"BigDog."

00:02:49.096 --> 00:02:52.406
It's got a gyroscope
that helps stabilize it.

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:55.766
It's got sensors and a control computer.

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:58.957
Here's a Cheetah robot
that's running with a galloping gait,

00:02:58.981 --> 00:03:00.677
where it recycles its energy,

00:03:00.701 --> 00:03:02.268
it bounces on the ground,

00:03:02.292 --> 00:03:03.846
and it's computing all the time

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:06.757
in order to keep itself
stabilized and propelled.

00:03:08.264 --> 00:03:10.092
And here's a bigger robot

00:03:10.116 --> 00:03:12.821
that's got such good
locomotion using its legs,

00:03:12.845 --> 00:03:14.249
that it can go in deep snow.

00:03:14.273 --> 00:03:16.684
This is about 10 inches deep,

00:03:16.708 --> 00:03:18.819
and it doesn't really have any trouble.

00:03:20.496 --> 00:03:23.125
This is Spot, a new generation of robot --

00:03:23.149 --> 00:03:25.957
just slightly older than the one
that came out onstage.

00:03:26.588 --> 00:03:28.420
And we've been asking the question --

00:03:28.444 --> 00:03:30.418
you've all heard about drone delivery:

00:03:30.442 --> 00:03:33.065
Can we deliver packages
to your houses with drones?

00:03:33.089 --> 00:03:35.876
Well, what about plain old
legged-robot delivery?

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:37.032
(Laughter)

00:03:37.056 --> 00:03:40.453
So we've been taking our robot
to our employees' homes

00:03:40.477 --> 00:03:42.060
to see whether we could get in --

00:03:42.084 --> 00:03:43.108
(Laughter)

00:03:43.132 --> 00:03:44.360
the various access ways.

00:03:44.384 --> 00:03:46.268
And believe me, in the Boston area,

00:03:46.292 --> 00:03:49.466
there's every manner
of stairway twists and turns.

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:50.727
So it's a real challenge.

00:03:50.751 --> 00:03:53.568
But we're doing very well,
about 70 percent of the way.

00:03:54.809 --> 00:03:56.374
And here's mobile manipulation,

00:03:56.398 --> 00:03:58.989
where we've put an arm on the robot,

00:03:59.013 --> 00:04:01.347
and it's finding its way through the door.

00:04:02.072 --> 00:04:05.231
Now, one of the important things
about making autonomous robots

00:04:05.255 --> 00:04:08.475
is to make them not do
just exactly what you say,

00:04:08.499 --> 00:04:13.640
but make them deal with the uncertainty
of what happens in the real world.

00:04:14.384 --> 00:04:17.395
So we have Steve there,
one of the engineers,

00:04:17.419 --> 00:04:19.027
giving the robot a hard time.

00:04:19.051 --> 00:04:20.083
(Laughter)

00:04:20.107 --> 00:04:24.297
And the fact that the programming
still tolerates all that disturbance --

00:04:24.321 --> 00:04:25.818
it does what it's supposed to.

00:04:25.842 --> 00:04:28.633
Here's another example,
where Eric is tugging on the robot

00:04:28.657 --> 00:04:29.955
as it goes up the stairs.

00:04:29.979 --> 00:04:31.131
And believe me,

00:04:31.155 --> 00:04:34.427
getting it to do what it's supposed to do
in those circumstances

00:04:34.451 --> 00:04:35.792
is a real challenge,

00:04:35.816 --> 00:04:38.556
but the result is something
that's going to generalize

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:42.451
and make robots much more autonomous
than they would be otherwise.

00:04:43.647 --> 00:04:46.078
This is Atlas, a humanoid robot.

00:04:46.757 --> 00:04:50.662
It's a third-generation humanoid
that we've been building.

00:04:51.001 --> 00:04:53.819
I'll tell you a little bit
about the hardware design later.

00:04:53.843 --> 00:04:55.019
And we've been saying:

00:04:55.043 --> 00:04:59.466
How close to human levels
of performance and speed could we get

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:01.065
in an ordinary task,

00:05:01.089 --> 00:05:03.558
like moving boxes around on a conveyor?

00:05:04.261 --> 00:05:09.567
We're getting up to about two-thirds
of the speed that a human operates

00:05:09.591 --> 00:05:10.753
on average.

00:05:11.088 --> 00:05:14.017
And this robot is using both hands,
it's using its body,

00:05:14.041 --> 00:05:15.210
it's stepping,

00:05:15.234 --> 00:05:17.961
so it's really an example
of dynamic stability,

00:05:17.985 --> 00:05:19.364
mobile manipulation

00:05:19.388 --> 00:05:20.999
and mobile perception.

00:05:22.522 --> 00:05:23.695
Here --

00:05:24.235 --> 00:05:26.142
(Laughter)

00:05:26.719 --> 00:05:28.329
We actually have two Atlases.

00:05:28.813 --> 00:05:29.998
(Laughter)

00:05:30.528 --> 00:05:33.924
Now, everything doesn't go exactly
the way it's supposed to.

00:05:33.948 --> 00:05:35.650
(Laughter)

00:05:38.648 --> 00:05:40.176
(Laughter)

00:05:40.866 --> 00:05:42.737
(Laughter)

00:05:45.622 --> 00:05:48.166
And here's our latest robot,
called "Handle."

00:05:48.787 --> 00:05:52.905
Handle is interesting,
because it's sort of half like an animal,

00:05:52.929 --> 00:05:55.243
and it's half something else

00:05:55.267 --> 00:05:58.023
with these leg-like things and wheels.

00:05:58.471 --> 00:06:01.497
It's got its arms on
in kind of a funny way,

00:06:01.521 --> 00:06:03.617
but it really does some remarkable things.

00:06:03.641 --> 00:06:06.972
It can carry 100 pounds.

00:06:06.996 --> 00:06:09.055
It's probably going to lift
more than that,

00:06:09.079 --> 00:06:10.857
but so far we've done 100.

00:06:10.881 --> 00:06:13.317
It's got some pretty good
rough-terrain capability,

00:06:13.341 --> 00:06:14.769
even though it has wheels.

00:06:18.211 --> 00:06:20.577
And Handle loves to put on a show.

00:06:21.016 --> 00:06:22.374
(Laughter)

00:06:24.974 --> 00:06:30.103
(Applause)

00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:34.068
I'm going to give you
a little bit of robot religion.

00:06:34.686 --> 00:06:39.015
A lot of people think that a robot
is a machine where there's a computer

00:06:39.039 --> 00:06:40.673
that's telling it what to do,

00:06:41.230 --> 00:06:44.046
and the computer is listening
through its sensors.

00:06:44.679 --> 00:06:47.083
But that's really only half of the story.

00:06:47.107 --> 00:06:50.216
The real story is
that the computer is on one side,

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:52.184
making suggestions to the robot,

00:06:52.208 --> 00:06:54.700
and on the other side
are the physics of the world.

00:06:55.108 --> 00:07:00.030
And that physics involves gravity,
friction, bouncing into things.

00:07:00.568 --> 00:07:02.403
In order to have a successful robot,

00:07:02.427 --> 00:07:07.018
my religion is that you have to do
a holistic design,

00:07:07.042 --> 00:07:10.595
where you're designing the software,
the hardware and the behavior

00:07:10.619 --> 00:07:11.855
all at one time,

00:07:11.879 --> 00:07:15.581
and all these parts really intermesh
and cooperate with each other.

00:07:15.605 --> 00:07:18.712
And when you get the perfect design,
you get a real harmony

00:07:18.736 --> 00:07:21.615
between all those parts
interacting with each other.

00:07:22.599 --> 00:07:24.859
So it's half software and half hardware,

00:07:24.883 --> 00:07:26.174
plus the behavior.

00:07:27.028 --> 00:07:30.570
We've done some work lately
on the hardware, where we tried to go --

00:07:30.594 --> 00:07:33.071
the picture on the left
is a conventional design,

00:07:33.095 --> 00:07:35.995
where you have parts
that are all bolted together,

00:07:36.019 --> 00:07:38.759
conductors, tubes, connectors.

00:07:38.783 --> 00:07:40.832
And on the right
is a more integrated thing;

00:07:40.856 --> 00:07:43.257
it's supposed to look like
an anatomy drawing.

00:07:43.660 --> 00:07:46.170
Using the miracle of 3-D printing,

00:07:46.194 --> 00:07:48.831
we're starting to build parts of robots

00:07:48.855 --> 00:07:51.752
that look a lot more
like the anatomy of an animal.

00:07:51.776 --> 00:07:55.120
So that's an upper-leg part
that has hydraulic pathways --

00:07:55.144 --> 00:07:57.074
actuators, filters --

00:07:57.098 --> 00:07:59.478
all embedded, all printed as one piece,

00:07:59.502 --> 00:08:02.704
and the whole structure is developed

00:08:02.728 --> 00:08:05.764
with a knowledge of what the loads
and behavior are going to be,

00:08:05.788 --> 00:08:08.691
which is available from data
recorded from robots

00:08:08.715 --> 00:08:10.524
and simulations and things like that.

00:08:10.548 --> 00:08:13.485
So it's a data-driven hardware design.

00:08:13.877 --> 00:08:15.603
And using processes like that,

00:08:15.627 --> 00:08:17.871
not only the upper leg
but some other things,

00:08:17.895 --> 00:08:23.035
we've gotten our robots to go from big,
behemoth, bulky, slow, bad robots --

00:08:23.059 --> 00:08:26.678
that one on the right,
weighing almost 400 pounds --

00:08:26.702 --> 00:08:29.811
down to the one in the middle
which was just in the video,

00:08:29.835 --> 00:08:31.398
weighs about 190 pounds,

00:08:31.422 --> 00:08:33.119
just a little bit more than me,

00:08:33.143 --> 00:08:34.629
and we have a new one,

00:08:34.653 --> 00:08:37.395
which is working but I'm not
going to show it to you yet,

00:08:37.419 --> 00:08:38.581
on the left,

00:08:38.605 --> 00:08:40.249
which weighs just 165 pounds,

00:08:40.273 --> 00:08:42.539
with all the same
strength and capabilities.

00:08:42.563 --> 00:08:45.293
So these things are really getting
better very quickly.

00:08:46.610 --> 00:08:49.872
So it's time for Spot to come back out,

00:08:49.896 --> 00:08:53.644
and we're going to demonstrate
a little bit of mobility,

00:08:53.668 --> 00:08:55.268
dexterity and perception.

00:08:56.011 --> 00:08:59.775
This is Seth Davis,
who's my robot wrangler today,

00:08:59.799 --> 00:09:02.839
and he's giving Spot
some general direction

00:09:02.863 --> 00:09:04.689
by steering it around,

00:09:04.713 --> 00:09:07.784
but all the coordination
of the legs and the sensors

00:09:07.808 --> 00:09:10.317
is done by the robot's computers on board.

00:09:10.873 --> 00:09:14.319
The robot can walk
with a number of different gaits;

00:09:14.343 --> 00:09:16.502
it's got a gyro,

00:09:16.526 --> 00:09:17.863
or a solid-state gyro,

00:09:17.887 --> 00:09:19.307
an IMU on board.

00:09:19.772 --> 00:09:22.799
Obviously, it's got a battery,
and things like that.

00:09:23.682 --> 00:09:26.188
One of the cool things
about a legged robot is,

00:09:26.212 --> 00:09:27.661
it's omnidirectional.

00:09:27.685 --> 00:09:30.458
In addition to going forward,
it can go sideways,

00:09:31.743 --> 00:09:33.183
it can turn in place.

00:09:36.812 --> 00:09:39.080
And this robot
is a little bit of a show-off.

00:09:40.005 --> 00:09:41.965
It loves to use its dynamic gaits,

00:09:41.989 --> 00:09:43.147
like running --

00:09:43.171 --> 00:09:44.215
(Laughter)

00:09:44.239 --> 00:09:45.755
And it's got one more.

00:09:47.434 --> 00:09:49.264
(Laughter)

00:09:50.188 --> 00:09:53.424
Now if it were really a show-off,
it would be hopping on one foot,

00:09:53.448 --> 00:09:54.616
but, you know.

00:09:54.640 --> 00:09:58.683
Now, Spot has a set of cameras
here, stereo cameras,

00:09:58.707 --> 00:10:00.537
and we have a feed up in the center.

00:10:00.921 --> 00:10:02.745
It's kind of dark out in the audience,

00:10:02.769 --> 00:10:05.989
but it's going to use those cameras
in order to look at the terrain

00:10:06.013 --> 00:10:07.186
right in front of it,

00:10:07.210 --> 00:10:09.971
while it goes over
these obstacles back here.

00:10:09.995 --> 00:10:13.308
For this demo, Seth is steering,

00:10:13.332 --> 00:10:15.837
but the robot's doing
all its own terrain planning.

00:10:15.861 --> 00:10:17.363
This is a terrain map,

00:10:17.387 --> 00:10:22.557
where the data from the cameras
is being developed in real time,

00:10:22.581 --> 00:10:25.818
showing the red spots,
which are where it doesn't want to step,

00:10:25.842 --> 00:10:27.833
and the green spots are the good places.

00:10:27.857 --> 00:10:30.306
And here it's treating
them like stepping-stones.

00:10:30.330 --> 00:10:33.085
So it's trying to stay up on the blocks,

00:10:33.109 --> 00:10:34.382
and it adjusts its stride,

00:10:34.406 --> 00:10:35.867
and there's a ton of planning

00:10:35.891 --> 00:10:38.132
that has to go into
an operation like that,

00:10:38.156 --> 00:10:40.418
and it does all
that planning in real time,

00:10:40.442 --> 00:10:42.872
where it adjusts the steps
a little bit longer

00:10:42.896 --> 00:10:44.172
or a little bit shorter.

00:10:45.546 --> 00:10:47.976
Now we're going to change it
into a different mode,

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:51.423
where it's just going to treat
the blocks like terrain

00:10:51.447 --> 00:10:55.166
and decide whether to step up or down

00:10:55.190 --> 00:10:56.475
as it goes.

00:10:57.415 --> 00:11:00.384
So this is using dynamic balance

00:11:00.408 --> 00:11:02.266
and mobile perception,

00:11:02.290 --> 00:11:07.677
because it has to coordinate what it sees
along with how it's moving.

00:11:09.318 --> 00:11:13.636
The other thing Spot has is a robot arm.

00:11:14.667 --> 00:11:17.157
Some of you may see that
as a head and a neck,

00:11:17.181 --> 00:11:18.766
but believe me, it's an arm.

00:11:18.790 --> 00:11:20.555
Seth is driving it around.

00:11:20.579 --> 00:11:24.347
He's actually driving the hand
and the body is following.

00:11:24.371 --> 00:11:28.504
So the two are coordinated
in the way I was talking about before --

00:11:28.528 --> 00:11:30.392
in the way people can do that.

00:11:30.416 --> 00:11:35.059
In fact, one of the cool things
Spot can do we call, "chicken-head mode,"

00:11:35.083 --> 00:11:38.267
and it keeps its head
in one place in space,

00:11:38.291 --> 00:11:40.136
and it moves its body all around.

00:11:40.883 --> 00:11:43.485
There's a variation of this
that's called "twerking" --

00:11:43.509 --> 00:11:44.525
(Laughter)

00:11:44.549 --> 00:11:46.372
but we're not going to use that today.

00:11:46.396 --> 00:11:47.467
(Laughter)

00:11:47.491 --> 00:11:51.077
So, Spot: I'm feeling a little thirsty.
Could you get me a soda?

00:11:51.623 --> 00:11:55.396
For this demo,
Seth is not doing any driving.

00:11:55.420 --> 00:11:57.533
We have a LIDAR on the back of the robot,

00:11:57.557 --> 00:12:00.094
and it's using these props
we've put on the stage

00:12:00.118 --> 00:12:01.511
to localize itself.

00:12:01.535 --> 00:12:03.816
It's gone over to that location.

00:12:03.840 --> 00:12:06.722
Now it's using a camera that's in its hand

00:12:06.746 --> 00:12:08.532
to find the cup,

00:12:09.183 --> 00:12:10.438
picks it up --

00:12:10.462 --> 00:12:12.413
and again, Seth's not driving.

00:12:13.702 --> 00:12:16.943
We've planned out a path for it to go --

00:12:16.967 --> 00:12:19.074
it looked like it was
going off the path --

00:12:19.098 --> 00:12:21.456
and now Seth's going
to take over control again,

00:12:21.480 --> 00:12:24.929
because I'm a little bit chicken
about having it do this by itself.

00:12:24.953 --> 00:12:26.329
Thank you, Spot.

00:12:28.561 --> 00:12:33.844
(Applause)

00:12:35.219 --> 00:12:36.809
So, Spot:

00:12:36.833 --> 00:12:40.400
How do you feel about having just finished
your TED performance?

00:12:41.344 --> 00:12:44.033
(Laughter)

00:12:44.398 --> 00:12:45.550
Me, too!

00:12:45.574 --> 00:12:46.606
(Laughter)

00:12:46.630 --> 00:12:48.446
Thank you all,

00:12:48.470 --> 00:12:50.865
and thanks to the team at Boston Dynamics,

00:12:50.889 --> 00:12:53.003
who did all the hard work behind this.

00:12:53.027 --> 00:12:55.150
(Applause)

00:13:03.389 --> 00:13:05.552
Helen Walters: Marc,
come back in the middle.

00:13:05.576 --> 00:13:06.730
Thank you so much.

00:13:06.754 --> 00:13:08.849
Come over here, I have questions.

00:13:08.873 --> 00:13:12.288
So, you mentioned the UPS
and the package delivery.

00:13:12.312 --> 00:13:16.249
What are the other applications
that you see for your robots?

00:13:16.273 --> 00:13:18.300
Marc Raibert: You know,
I think that robots

00:13:18.324 --> 00:13:20.730
that have the capabilities
I've been talking about

00:13:20.754 --> 00:13:22.414
are going to be incredibly useful.

00:13:22.438 --> 00:13:24.935
About a year ago, I went to Fukushima

00:13:24.959 --> 00:13:26.990
to see what the situation was there,

00:13:27.014 --> 00:13:28.891
and there's just a huge need

00:13:28.915 --> 00:13:32.253
for machines that can go
into some of the dirty places

00:13:32.277 --> 00:13:34.245
and help remediate that.

00:13:34.858 --> 00:13:39.457
I think it won't be too long until
we have robots like this in our homes,

00:13:39.481 --> 00:13:44.802
and one of the big needs
is to take care of the aging

00:13:44.826 --> 00:13:46.192
and invalids.

00:13:46.216 --> 00:13:50.205
I think that it won't be too long
till we're using robots

00:13:50.229 --> 00:13:52.691
to help take care of our parents,

00:13:52.715 --> 00:13:57.130
or probably more likely,
have our children help take care of us.

00:13:58.051 --> 00:13:59.801
And there's a bunch of other things.

00:13:59.825 --> 00:14:01.191
I think the sky's the limit.

00:14:01.215 --> 00:14:03.473
Many of the ideas
we haven't thought of yet,

00:14:03.497 --> 00:14:07.092
and people like you will help us
think of new applications.

00:14:07.116 --> 00:14:08.703
HW: So what about the dark side?

00:14:08.727 --> 00:14:10.560
What about the military?

00:14:10.584 --> 00:14:12.087
Are they interested?

00:14:12.771 --> 00:14:16.405
MR: Sure, the military has been
a big funder of robotics.

00:14:16.429 --> 00:14:20.631
I don't think the military
is the dark side myself,

00:14:20.655 --> 00:14:24.526
but I think, as with all
advanced technology,

00:14:24.550 --> 00:14:26.597
it can be used for all kinds of things.

00:14:26.621 --> 00:14:28.262
HW: Awesome. Thank you so much.

00:14:28.286 --> 00:14:29.691
MR: OK, you're welcome.

00:14:29.715 --> 00:14:30.867
Thank you.

00:14:30.891 --> 00:14:32.477
(Applause)
