00:00:13.054 --> 00:00:14.333
I used to think

00:00:14.357 --> 00:00:18.091
the whole purpose of life
was pursuing happiness.

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:22.214
Everyone said the path
to happiness was success,

00:00:22.238 --> 00:00:24.736
so I searched for that ideal job,

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:27.791
that perfect boyfriend,
that beautiful apartment.

00:00:29.148 --> 00:00:32.146
But instead of ever feeling fulfilled,

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:34.774
I felt anxious and adrift.

00:00:35.345 --> 00:00:39.354
And I wasn't alone; my friends --
they struggled with this, too.

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:45.139
Eventually, I decided to go
to graduate school for positive psychology

00:00:45.163 --> 00:00:48.383
to learn what truly makes people happy.

00:00:49.121 --> 00:00:51.777
But what I discovered there
changed my life.

00:00:52.602 --> 00:00:57.212
The data showed that chasing happiness
can make people unhappy.

00:00:58.117 --> 00:01:00.374
And what really struck me was this:

00:01:01.208 --> 00:01:03.995
the suicide rate has been rising
around the world,

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:07.110
and it recently reached
a 30-year high in America.

00:01:07.903 --> 00:01:10.666
Even though life is getting
objectively better

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:13.380
by nearly every conceivable standard,

00:01:13.404 --> 00:01:15.603
more people feel hopeless,

00:01:15.627 --> 00:01:17.752
depressed and alone.

00:01:18.364 --> 00:01:21.177
There's an emptiness
gnawing away at people,

00:01:21.201 --> 00:01:24.471
and you don't have to be
clinically depressed to feel it.

00:01:24.495 --> 00:01:27.395
Sooner or later, I think we all wonder:

00:01:27.934 --> 00:01:30.166
Is this all there is?

00:01:31.317 --> 00:01:34.523
And according to the research,
what predicts this despair

00:01:34.547 --> 00:01:36.374
is not a lack of happiness.

00:01:36.398 --> 00:01:38.240
It's a lack of something else,

00:01:38.967 --> 00:01:41.905
a lack of having meaning in life.

00:01:43.112 --> 00:01:45.505
But that raised some questions for me.

00:01:46.005 --> 00:01:48.604
Is there more to life than being happy?

00:01:49.366 --> 00:01:51.789
And what's the difference
between being happy

00:01:51.813 --> 00:01:53.704
and having meaning in life?

00:01:55.029 --> 00:01:59.629
Many psychologists define happiness
as a state of comfort and ease,

00:01:59.653 --> 00:02:01.542
feeling good in the moment.

00:02:02.248 --> 00:02:03.906
Meaning, though, is deeper.

00:02:04.428 --> 00:02:06.992
The renowned psychologist
Martin Seligman says

00:02:07.016 --> 00:02:11.663
meaning comes from belonging to
and serving something beyond yourself

00:02:11.687 --> 00:02:14.370
and from developing the best within you.

00:02:15.767 --> 00:02:18.362
Our culture is obsessed with happiness,

00:02:18.386 --> 00:02:22.493
but I came to see that seeking meaning
is the more fulfilling path.

00:02:22.517 --> 00:02:25.446
And the studies show that people
who have meaning in life,

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:26.880
they're more resilient,

00:02:26.904 --> 00:02:29.461
they do better in school and at work,

00:02:29.485 --> 00:02:31.092
and they even live longer.

00:02:32.135 --> 00:02:34.156
So this all made me wonder:

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:36.654
How can we each live more meaningfully?

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:41.808
To find out, I spent five years
interviewing hundreds of people

00:02:41.832 --> 00:02:44.733
and reading through thousands
of pages of psychology,

00:02:44.757 --> 00:02:46.858
neuroscience and philosophy.

00:02:47.516 --> 00:02:49.305
Bringing it all together,

00:02:49.329 --> 00:02:54.670
I found that there are what I call
four pillars of a meaningful life.

00:02:54.694 --> 00:02:57.128
And we can each create lives of meaning

00:02:57.152 --> 00:03:00.501
by building some or all
of these pillars in our lives.

00:03:01.578 --> 00:03:03.766
The first pillar is belonging.

00:03:04.528 --> 00:03:06.835
Belonging comes
from being in relationships

00:03:06.859 --> 00:03:09.564
where you're valued
for who you are intrinsically

00:03:09.588 --> 00:03:11.701
and where you value others as well.

00:03:12.368 --> 00:03:17.058
But some groups and relationships
deliver a cheap form of belonging;

00:03:17.082 --> 00:03:18.975
you're valued for what you believe,

00:03:18.999 --> 00:03:20.245
for who you hate,

00:03:20.269 --> 00:03:21.814
not for who you are.

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:25.353
True belonging springs from love.

00:03:25.377 --> 00:03:28.362
It lives in moments among individuals,

00:03:28.386 --> 00:03:32.231
and it's a choice -- you can choose
to cultivate belonging with others.

00:03:32.811 --> 00:03:34.418
Here's an example.

00:03:34.442 --> 00:03:37.997
Each morning, my friend Jonathan
buys a newspaper

00:03:38.021 --> 00:03:40.239
from the same street vendor in New York.

00:03:40.652 --> 00:03:42.932
They don't just conduct
a transaction, though.

00:03:42.956 --> 00:03:45.639
They take a moment to slow down, talk,

00:03:45.663 --> 00:03:47.569
and treat each other like humans.

00:03:48.188 --> 00:03:51.582
But one time, Jonathan
didn't have the right change,

00:03:51.606 --> 00:03:52.826
and the vendor said,

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:54.370
"Don't worry about it."

00:03:54.394 --> 00:03:56.881
But Jonathan insisted on paying,

00:03:56.905 --> 00:03:59.917
so he went to the store
and bought something he didn't need

00:03:59.941 --> 00:04:01.402
to make change.

00:04:02.142 --> 00:04:04.765
But when he gave the money to the vendor,

00:04:04.789 --> 00:04:06.311
the vendor drew back.

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:08.248
He was hurt.

00:04:08.865 --> 00:04:10.714
He was trying to do something kind,

00:04:10.738 --> 00:04:12.985
but Jonathan had rejected him.

00:04:14.263 --> 00:04:18.414
I think we all reject people in small ways
like this without realizing it.

00:04:18.438 --> 00:04:19.636
I do.

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:22.723
I'll walk by someone I know
and barely acknowledge them.

00:04:22.747 --> 00:04:25.394
I'll check my phone
when someone's talking to me.

00:04:25.828 --> 00:04:27.757
These acts devalue others.

00:04:27.781 --> 00:04:30.534
They make them feel
invisible and unworthy.

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:34.032
But when you lead with love,
you create a bond

00:04:34.056 --> 00:04:35.728
that lifts each of you up.

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:40.808
For many people, belonging
is the most essential source of meaning,

00:04:40.832 --> 00:04:42.830
those bonds to family and friends.

00:04:43.326 --> 00:04:47.331
For others, the key to meaning
is the second pillar: purpose.

00:04:47.994 --> 00:04:50.909
Now, finding your purpose
is not the same thing

00:04:50.933 --> 00:04:53.181
as finding that job that makes you happy.

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:57.129
Purpose is less about what you want
than about what you give.

00:04:57.153 --> 00:05:01.641
A hospital custodian told me
her purpose is healing sick people.

00:05:01.665 --> 00:05:03.376
Many parents tell me,

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:05.336
"My purpose is raising my children."

00:05:05.677 --> 00:05:09.721
The key to purpose
is using your strengths to serve others.

00:05:10.531 --> 00:05:14.039
Of course, for many of us,
that happens through work.

00:05:14.063 --> 00:05:17.042
That's how we contribute and feel needed.

00:05:17.066 --> 00:05:20.926
But that also means
that issues like disengagement at work,

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:22.363
unemployment,

00:05:22.387 --> 00:05:24.614
low labor force participation --

00:05:24.638 --> 00:05:28.329
these aren't just economic problems,
they're existential ones, too.

00:05:28.971 --> 00:05:31.184
Without something worthwhile to do,

00:05:31.208 --> 00:05:32.509
people flounder.

00:05:33.643 --> 00:05:36.259
Of course, you don't have to find
purpose at work,

00:05:36.283 --> 00:05:39.012
but purpose gives you
something to live for,

00:05:39.036 --> 00:05:41.116
some "why" that drives you forward.

00:05:43.297 --> 00:05:46.597
The third pillar of meaning
is also about stepping beyond yourself,

00:05:46.621 --> 00:05:48.463
but in a completely different way:

00:05:48.487 --> 00:05:50.074
transcendence.

00:05:50.098 --> 00:05:52.475
Transcendent states are those rare moments

00:05:52.499 --> 00:05:55.911
when you're lifted above
the hustle and bustle of daily life,

00:05:55.935 --> 00:05:57.640
your sense of self fades away,

00:05:57.664 --> 00:06:00.438
and you feel connected
to a higher reality.

00:06:01.364 --> 00:06:05.054
For one person I talked to,
transcendence came from seeing art.

00:06:05.078 --> 00:06:07.608
For another person, it was at church.

00:06:07.632 --> 00:06:11.186
For me, I'm a writer,
and it happens through writing.

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:16.280
Sometimes I get so in the zone
that I lose all sense of time and place.

00:06:16.907 --> 00:06:20.053
These transcendent
experiences can change you.

00:06:20.077 --> 00:06:24.601
One study had students look up
at 200-feet-tall eucalyptus trees

00:06:24.625 --> 00:06:25.826
for one minute.

00:06:26.413 --> 00:06:28.567
But afterwards
they felt less self-centered,

00:06:28.591 --> 00:06:30.535
and they even behaved more generously

00:06:30.559 --> 00:06:32.629
when given the chance to help someone.

00:06:33.732 --> 00:06:37.452
Belonging, purpose, transcendence.

00:06:38.524 --> 00:06:41.247
Now, the fourth pillar
of meaning, I've found,

00:06:41.271 --> 00:06:43.026
tends to surprise people.

00:06:43.516 --> 00:06:46.250
The fourth pillar is storytelling,

00:06:46.274 --> 00:06:49.139
the story you tell yourself
about yourself.

00:06:49.766 --> 00:06:53.910
Creating a narrative from the events
of your life brings clarity.

00:06:53.934 --> 00:06:56.970
It helps you understand
how you became you.

00:06:57.819 --> 00:07:00.915
But we don't always realize
that we're the authors of our stories

00:07:00.939 --> 00:07:03.102
and can change the way we're telling them.

00:07:03.126 --> 00:07:05.617
Your life isn't just a list of events.

00:07:05.641 --> 00:07:08.857
You can edit, interpret
and retell your story,

00:07:08.881 --> 00:07:11.101
even as you're constrained by the facts.

00:07:11.831 --> 00:07:16.459
I met a young man named Emeka,
who'd been paralyzed playing football.

00:07:17.070 --> 00:07:19.529
After his injury, Emeka told himself,

00:07:19.553 --> 00:07:22.258
"My life was great playing football,

00:07:22.282 --> 00:07:24.406
but now look at me."

00:07:26.152 --> 00:07:28.444
People who tell stories like this --

00:07:28.468 --> 00:07:30.992
"My life was good. Now it's bad." --

00:07:31.016 --> 00:07:33.838
tend to be more anxious and depressed.

00:07:33.862 --> 00:07:36.191
And that was Emeka for a while.

00:07:36.723 --> 00:07:40.114
But with time, he started
to weave a different story.

00:07:40.565 --> 00:07:42.298
His new story was,

00:07:42.322 --> 00:07:45.589
"Before my injury,
my life was purposeless.

00:07:45.613 --> 00:07:48.866
I partied a lot and was
a pretty selfish guy.

00:07:48.890 --> 00:07:52.598
But my injury made me realize
I could be a better man."

00:07:53.638 --> 00:07:57.179
That edit to his story
changed Emeka's life.

00:07:57.203 --> 00:07:59.634
After telling the new story to himself,

00:07:59.658 --> 00:08:01.580
Emeka started mentoring kids,

00:08:01.604 --> 00:08:03.970
and he discovered what his purpose was:

00:08:03.994 --> 00:08:05.384
serving others.

00:08:06.251 --> 00:08:09.629
The psychologist Dan McAdams
calls this a "redemptive story,"

00:08:09.653 --> 00:08:11.936
where the bad is redeemed by the good.

00:08:12.777 --> 00:08:14.960
People leading meaningful
lives, he's found,

00:08:14.984 --> 00:08:16.915
tend to tell stories about their lives

00:08:16.939 --> 00:08:19.961
defined by redemption, growth and love.

00:08:20.873 --> 00:08:23.335
But what makes people
change their stories?

00:08:23.875 --> 00:08:25.803
Some people get help from a therapist,

00:08:25.827 --> 00:08:27.637
but you can do it on your own, too,

00:08:27.661 --> 00:08:30.421
just by reflecting
on your life thoughtfully,

00:08:30.445 --> 00:08:32.532
how your defining experiences shaped you,

00:08:32.556 --> 00:08:34.293
what you lost, what you gained.

00:08:34.739 --> 00:08:36.273
That's what Emeka did.

00:08:37.162 --> 00:08:39.208
You won't change your story overnight;

00:08:39.232 --> 00:08:41.577
it could take years and be painful.

00:08:41.601 --> 00:08:44.535
After all, we've all suffered,
and we all struggle.

00:08:45.107 --> 00:08:49.446
But embracing those painful memories
can lead to new insights and wisdom,

00:08:49.470 --> 00:08:52.535
to finding that good that sustains you.

00:08:54.734 --> 00:08:59.267
Belonging, purpose,
transcendence, storytelling:

00:09:00.013 --> 00:09:02.744
those are the four pillars of meaning.

00:09:03.776 --> 00:09:05.382
When I was younger,

00:09:05.406 --> 00:09:09.044
I was lucky enough to be surrounded
by all of the pillars.

00:09:09.531 --> 00:09:14.071
My parents ran a Sufi meetinghouse
from our home in Montreal.

00:09:14.836 --> 00:09:19.319
Sufism is a spiritual practice
associated with the whirling dervishes

00:09:19.343 --> 00:09:20.736
and the poet Rumi.

00:09:21.580 --> 00:09:24.155
Twice a week, Sufis would come to our home

00:09:24.179 --> 00:09:27.939
to meditate, drink Persian tea,
and share stories.

00:09:28.359 --> 00:09:31.316
Their practice also involved
serving all of creation

00:09:31.340 --> 00:09:33.150
through small acts of love,

00:09:33.174 --> 00:09:36.515
which meant being kind
even when people wronged you.

00:09:36.539 --> 00:09:39.693
But it gave them a purpose:
to rein in the ego.

00:09:41.062 --> 00:09:43.678
Eventually, I left home for college

00:09:43.702 --> 00:09:47.404
and without the daily grounding
of Sufism in my life,

00:09:47.428 --> 00:09:49.016
I felt unmoored.

00:09:49.040 --> 00:09:52.628
And I started searching for those things
that make life worth living.

00:09:52.652 --> 00:09:54.765
That's what set me on this journey.

00:09:55.162 --> 00:09:56.919
Looking back, I now realize

00:09:56.943 --> 00:10:00.185
that the Sufi house
had a real culture of meaning.

00:10:00.209 --> 00:10:02.715
The pillars were part of the architecture,

00:10:02.739 --> 00:10:05.965
and the presence of the pillars
helped us all live more deeply.

00:10:06.564 --> 00:10:08.885
Of course, the same principle applies

00:10:08.909 --> 00:10:11.110
in other strong communities as well --

00:10:11.134 --> 00:10:13.156
good ones and bad ones.

00:10:13.706 --> 00:10:15.735
Gangs, cults:

00:10:15.759 --> 00:10:18.772
these are cultures of meaning
that use the pillars

00:10:18.796 --> 00:10:22.174
and give people
something to live and die for.

00:10:22.198 --> 00:10:25.065
But that's exactly why we as a society

00:10:25.089 --> 00:10:27.198
must offer better alternatives.

00:10:27.222 --> 00:10:30.973
We need to build these pillars
within our families and our institutions

00:10:30.997 --> 00:10:33.579
to help people become their best selves.

00:10:34.674 --> 00:10:37.260
But living a meaningful life takes work.

00:10:37.284 --> 00:10:39.159
It's an ongoing process.

00:10:39.183 --> 00:10:42.912
As each day goes by,
we're constantly creating our lives,

00:10:42.936 --> 00:10:44.505
adding to our story.

00:10:44.981 --> 00:10:47.730
And sometimes we can get off track.

00:10:48.512 --> 00:10:50.423
Whenever that happens to me,

00:10:50.447 --> 00:10:53.836
I remember a powerful experience
I had with my father.

00:10:55.971 --> 00:10:58.618
Several months after
I graduated from college,

00:10:58.642 --> 00:11:02.500
my dad had a massive heart attack
that should have killed him.

00:11:03.183 --> 00:11:06.397
He survived, and when I asked him
what was going through his mind

00:11:06.421 --> 00:11:08.043
as he faced death,

00:11:08.067 --> 00:11:10.750
he said all he could think about
was needing to live

00:11:10.774 --> 00:11:12.912
so he could be there
for my brother and me,

00:11:12.936 --> 00:11:15.525
and this gave him the will
to fight for life.

00:11:16.213 --> 00:11:19.511
When he went under anesthesia
for emergency surgery,

00:11:19.535 --> 00:11:21.865
instead of counting backwards from 10,

00:11:21.889 --> 00:11:25.059
he repeated our names like a mantra.

00:11:25.940 --> 00:11:29.751
He wanted our names to be
the last words he spoke on earth

00:11:29.775 --> 00:11:31.000
if he died.

00:11:33.183 --> 00:11:36.795
My dad is a carpenter and a Sufi.

00:11:37.335 --> 00:11:38.882
It's a humble life,

00:11:38.906 --> 00:11:40.175
but a good life.

00:11:40.714 --> 00:11:44.626
Lying there facing death,
he had a reason to live:

00:11:44.650 --> 00:11:46.058
love.

00:11:46.082 --> 00:11:48.533
His sense of belonging within his family,

00:11:48.557 --> 00:11:50.286
his purpose as a dad,

00:11:50.310 --> 00:11:53.324
his transcendent meditation,
repeating our names --

00:11:53.348 --> 00:11:56.129
these, he says, are the reasons
why he survived.

00:11:56.153 --> 00:11:58.592
That's the story he tells himself.

00:11:59.897 --> 00:12:02.047
That's the power of meaning.

00:12:02.793 --> 00:12:05.585
Happiness comes and goes.

00:12:05.609 --> 00:12:07.458
But when life is really good

00:12:07.482 --> 00:12:09.371
and when things are really bad,

00:12:09.391 --> 00:12:12.444
having meaning gives you
something to hold on to.

00:12:12.472 --> 00:12:13.696
Thank you.

00:12:13.720 --> 00:12:17.302
