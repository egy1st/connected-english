00:00:12.974 --> 00:00:16.894
I'd like for you to take a moment
to imagine this with me.

00:00:18.294 --> 00:00:21.402
You're a little girl of five years old.

00:00:22.219 --> 00:00:23.948
Sitting in front of a mirror,

00:00:23.972 --> 00:00:25.471
you ask yourself,

00:00:26.545 --> 00:00:27.736
"Do I exist?"

00:00:29.404 --> 00:00:32.056
In this space, there is
very little context,

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:34.644
and so you move into a different one,

00:00:34.668 --> 00:00:36.242
one filled with people.

00:00:37.274 --> 00:00:40.537
Surely, now you know you're not
a figment of your own imagination.

00:00:41.373 --> 00:00:42.904
You breathe their air.

00:00:43.535 --> 00:00:44.965
You see them,

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:46.403
so they must see you.

00:00:47.498 --> 00:00:51.138
And yet, you still can't help but wonder:

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:56.459
Do I only exist when people speak to me?

00:00:57.946 --> 00:00:59.900
Pretty heavy thoughts for a child, right?

00:01:01.151 --> 00:01:05.659
But through various artworks
that reflect upon our society,

00:01:05.683 --> 00:01:09.833
I came to understand
how a young black girl can grow up

00:01:09.857 --> 00:01:14.971
feeling as if she's not seen,
and perhaps she doesn't exist.

00:01:16.487 --> 00:01:20.256
You see, if young people don't have
positive images of themselves

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.448
and all that remains
are negative stereotypes,

00:01:23.472 --> 00:01:25.297
this affects their self-image.

00:01:26.364 --> 00:01:29.710
But it also affects the way
that the rest of society treats them.

00:01:31.432 --> 00:01:32.668
I discovered this

00:01:32.692 --> 00:01:36.397
having lived in Cape Town
for about five years at the time.

00:01:37.264 --> 00:01:42.214
I felt a deep sense
of dislocation and invisibility.

00:01:43.472 --> 00:01:45.536
I couldn't see myself represented.

00:01:46.511 --> 00:01:49.366
I couldn't see the women who've raised me,

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:51.252
the ones who've influenced me,

00:01:51.276 --> 00:01:54.007
and the ones that have made
South Africa what it is today.

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:56.974
I decided to do something about it.

00:01:59.275 --> 00:02:01.848
What do you think when you see this?

00:02:03.901 --> 00:02:06.022
If you were a black girl,

00:02:06.046 --> 00:02:07.781
how would it make you feel?

00:02:09.423 --> 00:02:11.868
Walking down the street,

00:02:11.892 --> 00:02:14.806
what does the city you live in say to you?

00:02:15.776 --> 00:02:17.212
What symbols are present?

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:19.301
Which histories are celebrated?

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:21.435
And on the other hand,

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:23.000
which ones are omitted?

00:02:23.853 --> 00:02:27.904
You see, public spaces are hardly
ever as neutral as they may seem.

00:02:28.602 --> 00:02:34.622
I discovered this when I made
this performance in 2013 on Heritage Day.

00:02:36.422 --> 00:02:41.557
Cape Town is teeming
with masculine architecture,

00:02:41.581 --> 00:02:43.640
monuments and statues,

00:02:43.664 --> 00:02:45.928
such as Louis Botha in that photograph.

00:02:46.986 --> 00:02:52.902
This overt presence of white colonial
and Afrikaner nationalist men

00:02:52.926 --> 00:02:58.348
not only echoes a social,
gender and racial divide,

00:02:59.077 --> 00:03:03.703
but it also continues to affect
the way that women --

00:03:03.727 --> 00:03:06.927
and the way, particularly, black women --

00:03:06.951 --> 00:03:12.362
see themselves in relation
to dominant male figures

00:03:12.386 --> 00:03:13.811
in public spaces.

00:03:17.226 --> 00:03:19.518
For this reason, among others,

00:03:19.542 --> 00:03:21.614
I don't believe that we need statues.

00:03:22.656 --> 00:03:26.542
The preservation of history
and the act of remembering

00:03:26.566 --> 00:03:30.901
can be achieved in more memorable
and effective ways.

00:03:32.574 --> 00:03:36.433
As part of a year-long
public holiday series,

00:03:36.457 --> 00:03:40.584
I use performance art
as a form of social commentary

00:03:40.608 --> 00:03:43.806
to draw people's attention
to certain issues,

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:49.780
as well as addressing the absence
of the black female body

00:03:49.804 --> 00:03:52.042
in memorialized public spaces,

00:03:52.066 --> 00:03:54.032
especially on public holidays.

00:03:55.305 --> 00:03:56.924
Women's Day was coming up.

00:03:57.419 --> 00:03:59.132
I looked at what the day means --

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:04.765
the Women's March
to the union buildings in 1956,

00:04:04.789 --> 00:04:07.249
petitioning against the pass laws.

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:13.026
Juxtaposed with the hypocrisy
of how women are treated,

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:15.181
especially in public spaces today,

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:18.368
I decided to do something about it.

00:04:19.487 --> 00:04:21.143
Headline:

00:04:21.167 --> 00:04:26.709
[Women in miniskirt attacked at taxi rank]

00:04:29.159 --> 00:04:32.761
How do I comment on such polar opposites?

00:04:33.887 --> 00:04:36.028
In the guise of my great-grandmother,

00:04:36.052 --> 00:04:37.755
I performed bare-breasted,

00:04:37.779 --> 00:04:40.735
close to the taxi rank in KwaLanga.

00:04:41.476 --> 00:04:44.057
This space is also called Freedom Square,

00:04:44.081 --> 00:04:47.934
where women were a part of demonstrations
against apartheid laws.

00:04:49.306 --> 00:04:55.447
I was not comfortable with women
being seen as only victims in society.

00:04:56.689 --> 00:04:59.311
You might wonder
how people reacted to this.

00:05:00.081 --> 00:05:02.779
(Video) Woman: (Cheering)

00:05:03.516 --> 00:05:05.104
Woman 2 (offscreen): Yes!

00:05:13.204 --> 00:05:15.359
Sethembile Msezane: Pretty cool, huh?

00:05:16.284 --> 00:05:18.834
(Applause)

00:05:20.032 --> 00:05:22.986
So I realized that through
my performances,

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:28.094
I've been able to make regular people
reflect upon their society,

00:05:28.118 --> 00:05:31.818
looking at the past
as well as the current democracy.

00:05:31.842 --> 00:05:34.799
(Video) Man (offscreen):
She's been there since three o'clock.

00:05:34.823 --> 00:05:37.557
Man 2 (offscreen): Just before three.
About an hour still?

00:05:37.581 --> 00:05:39.546
Man 1: Yeah. It's just a really hot day.

00:05:45.861 --> 00:05:47.845
Man 1: It's very interesting.

00:05:47.869 --> 00:05:49.375
It's very powerful.

00:05:50.474 --> 00:05:51.933
I think it's cool.

00:05:54.793 --> 00:06:00.118
I think a lot of people
are quick to join a group

00:06:00.142 --> 00:06:02.014
that's a movement towards something,

00:06:02.038 --> 00:06:07.265
but not many people are ready
to do something as an individual.

00:06:07.289 --> 00:06:09.896
Man 2: So it's the individual
versus the collective.

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:11.076
Man 1: Yeah.

00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:16.357
So I think her pushing her own
individual message in performance ...

00:06:18.070 --> 00:06:19.332
it's powerful.

00:06:20.335 --> 00:06:23.509
Yeah, I think it's quite powerful
that she's doing it on her own.

00:06:25.616 --> 00:06:29.757
I'd be interested to know why
she's using hair extensions as wings,

00:06:29.781 --> 00:06:33.529
or whatever those things are meant to be.

00:06:35.024 --> 00:06:36.715
They are wings, yes?

00:06:38.904 --> 00:06:41.170
Woman 3: With her standing
there right now,

00:06:41.194 --> 00:06:45.154
I think it's just my interpretation

00:06:45.178 --> 00:06:48.549
that we are bringing the statue down

00:06:48.573 --> 00:06:50.798
and bringing up something

00:06:50.822 --> 00:06:55.427
that's supposed to represent
African pride, I think.

00:06:55.451 --> 00:06:56.971
Or something like that.

00:06:57.951 --> 00:07:01.427
Something should stand while Rhodes falls,

00:07:01.451 --> 00:07:04.158
I think that's what it's saying. Yeah.

00:07:04.898 --> 00:07:06.114
Yes. Thank you.

00:07:06.138 --> 00:07:09.601
Man 3: What is behind me
represents the African culture.

00:07:09.625 --> 00:07:12.014
We can't have the colonialist law,

00:07:12.038 --> 00:07:14.929
so we need to remove
all these colonial statues.

00:07:14.953 --> 00:07:17.447
We have have our own statues now,

00:07:17.471 --> 00:07:22.343
our African leaders --
Bhambatha, Moshoeshoe, Kwame Nkrumah --

00:07:22.367 --> 00:07:26.600
all those who paid their lives
for our liberation.

00:07:26.624 --> 00:07:28.932
We can't continue in the 21st century,

00:07:28.956 --> 00:07:30.993
and after 21 years of democracy,

00:07:31.017 --> 00:07:33.157
have the colonizers in our own country.

00:07:33.181 --> 00:07:36.154
They belong somewhere.
Maybe in a museum; not here.

00:07:36.178 --> 00:07:39.328
I mean learning institutions,
places where young people,

00:07:39.352 --> 00:07:40.930
young minds are being shaped.

00:07:40.954 --> 00:07:45.644
So we cannot continue to have Louis Botha,
Rhodes, all these people,

00:07:45.668 --> 00:07:48.433
because they're representing
the colonialism.

00:07:50.849 --> 00:07:54.871
(Applause)

00:07:56.165 --> 00:07:59.188
Sethembile Msezane: On April 9, 2015,

00:07:59.212 --> 00:08:03.189
the Cecil John Rhodes statue
was scheduled to be removed

00:08:03.213 --> 00:08:07.428
after a month of debates
for and against its removal

00:08:07.452 --> 00:08:09.240
by various stakeholders.

00:08:10.764 --> 00:08:14.670
This caused a widespread interest
in statues in South Africa.

00:08:15.361 --> 00:08:20.692
Opinions varied, but the media
focused on problematizing

00:08:20.716 --> 00:08:22.297
the removal of statues.

00:08:25.242 --> 00:08:29.077
On that -- well, that year,
I had just begun my master's

00:08:29.101 --> 00:08:30.966
at the University of Cape Town.

00:08:32.395 --> 00:08:35.785
During the time
of the debate of the statue,

00:08:35.809 --> 00:08:38.908
I had been having reoccurring dreams

00:08:39.743 --> 00:08:41.075
about a bird.

00:08:41.647 --> 00:08:44.325
And so I started conjuring her

00:08:44.349 --> 00:08:47.816
mentally, spiritually and through dress.

00:08:50.202 --> 00:08:51.895
On that day,

00:08:51.919 --> 00:08:55.555
I happened to be having
a meeting with my supervisors,

00:08:55.579 --> 00:08:59.184
and they told me that the statue
was going to fall on that day.

00:09:00.255 --> 00:09:02.674
I told them that I'd explain later,

00:09:02.698 --> 00:09:04.636
but we had to postpone the meeting

00:09:04.660 --> 00:09:09.138
because I was going to perform her
as the statue came down.

00:09:09.682 --> 00:09:11.562
Her name was Chapungu.

00:09:11.586 --> 00:09:15.966
She was a soapstone bird
that was looted from Great Zimbabwe

00:09:15.990 --> 00:09:17.738
in the late 1800s,

00:09:17.762 --> 00:09:21.795
and is still currently housed
in Cecil John Rhodes's estate

00:09:21.819 --> 00:09:22.969
in Cape Town.

00:09:24.254 --> 00:09:25.430
On that day,

00:09:25.454 --> 00:09:29.564
I embodied her existence using my body,

00:09:29.588 --> 00:09:33.449
while standing in the blazing sun
for nearly four hours.

00:09:35.396 --> 00:09:37.240
As the time came,

00:09:37.264 --> 00:09:38.807
the crane came alive.

00:09:39.351 --> 00:09:41.128
The people did, too --

00:09:41.152 --> 00:09:42.311
shouting,

00:09:42.335 --> 00:09:43.572
screaming,

00:09:43.596 --> 00:09:45.506
clenching their fists

00:09:45.530 --> 00:09:49.412
and taking pictures of the moment
on their phones and cameras.

00:09:50.089 --> 00:09:51.608
Chapungu's wings,

00:09:51.632 --> 00:09:53.031
along with the crane,

00:09:53.055 --> 00:09:58.028
rose to declare the fall
of Cecil John Rhodes.

00:09:59.293 --> 00:10:03.369
(Applause)

00:10:04.342 --> 00:10:08.935
Euphoria filled the air
as he became absent from his base,

00:10:08.959 --> 00:10:11.007
while she remained still,

00:10:12.341 --> 00:10:13.940
very present,

00:10:13.964 --> 00:10:16.609
half an hour after his removal.

00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:21.360
Twenty-three years after apartheid,

00:10:21.384 --> 00:10:24.787
a new generation of radicals
has arisen in South Africa.

00:10:24.811 --> 00:10:29.684
The story of Chapungu and Rhodes
in the same space and time

00:10:29.708 --> 00:10:31.463
asks important questions

00:10:31.487 --> 00:10:33.762
related to gender,

00:10:34.386 --> 00:10:35.663
power,

00:10:35.687 --> 00:10:37.468
self-representation,

00:10:37.492 --> 00:10:39.081
history making

00:10:39.105 --> 00:10:40.533
and repatriation.

00:10:43.400 --> 00:10:44.550
From then on,

00:10:44.574 --> 00:10:49.795
I realized that my spiritual
beliefs and dreams

00:10:49.819 --> 00:10:52.334
texture my material reality.

00:10:53.579 --> 00:10:56.942
But for me, Chapungu's story
felt incomplete.

00:10:56.966 --> 00:10:58.715
This soapstone bird,

00:10:58.739 --> 00:11:03.106
a spiritual medium and messenger
of God and the ancestors,

00:11:03.130 --> 00:11:05.229
needed me to continue her story.

00:11:05.831 --> 00:11:10.247
And so I dabbled in the dream space
a little bit more,

00:11:10.271 --> 00:11:12.902
and this is how "Falling" was born.

00:11:19.539 --> 00:11:21.006
[A film by Sethembile Msezane]

00:11:21.030 --> 00:11:24.275
(Video) (A capella singing)

00:11:52.139 --> 00:11:55.330
[FALLING]

00:11:59.064 --> 00:12:02.042
(Applause)

00:12:02.901 --> 00:12:04.051
In the film,

00:12:04.075 --> 00:12:07.833
Zimbabwe, South Africa and Germany
share a common story

00:12:07.857 --> 00:12:11.547
about the soapstone birds
that were looted from Great Zimbabwe.

00:12:12.486 --> 00:12:14.799
After Zimbabwe gained its independence,

00:12:14.823 --> 00:12:18.744
all the birds except for one
were returned to the monument.

00:12:19.314 --> 00:12:24.440
"Falling" explores the mythological belief
that there will be unrest

00:12:24.464 --> 00:12:27.141
until the final bird is returned.

00:12:29.048 --> 00:12:30.371
Through my work,

00:12:30.395 --> 00:12:33.825
I have realized a lot
about the world around me:

00:12:34.387 --> 00:12:36.383
how we move through spaces,

00:12:37.439 --> 00:12:39.774
who we choose to celebrate

00:12:39.798 --> 00:12:41.454
and who we remember.

00:12:42.230 --> 00:12:46.219
Now I look in the mirror
and not only see an image of myself,

00:12:47.009 --> 00:12:50.084
but of the women
who have made me who I am today.

00:12:50.866 --> 00:12:53.914
I stand tall in my work,

00:12:53.938 --> 00:12:56.399
celebrating women's histories,

00:12:56.423 --> 00:12:58.951
in the hope that perhaps one day,

00:12:59.644 --> 00:13:02.900
no little black girl has to ever feel

00:13:02.924 --> 00:13:04.810
like she doesn't exist.

00:13:04.834 --> 00:13:06.054
Thank you.

00:13:06.078 --> 00:13:10.323
(Applause)
