WEBVTT

00:00:12.943 --> 00:00:18.486
We humans are becoming an urban species,

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:22.286
so cities, they are our natural habitat.

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:23.510
That is where we live.

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:29.126
In 2014, over 54 percent

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:30.766
of the world population

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:32.830
was living in cities,

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:36.406
and I can bet you

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:39.086
that so many of these people have thought

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:41.686
of how they would do things differently,

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:44.366
like if I only had the tools

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:47.766
to change things in my city,

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:49.046
what would I do?

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:51.670
What would my dream city be like?

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:54.046
And these tools,

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:56.430
this is just what we gave them.

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:00.806
Two years ago, my team and I,

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:02.246
we released a game,

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:03.966
"Cities: Skylines."

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:06.830
It is a game about building cities.

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:11.486
So I have always been
interested in cities as systems.

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:15.406
It's something that I find
immensely interesting.

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:17.566
But what I didn't understand

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:20.070
was that I am not alone in this.

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:22.486
People love cities.

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:24.390
They are interested. They have ideas.

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:27.246
The game was an instant hit.

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:31.870
So far, over three and a half
million people have played it.

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:36.206
And it's not just about playing.

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:40.966
We also have really awesome
sharing systems.

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:43.686
So people play, they create cities

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.526
and then they are sharing these creations,

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:48.590
showing off what they have made.

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:52.686
And what I will show you

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.926
is some of these cities

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:56.270
created by the players.

00:01:56.870 --> 00:02:01.366
So the game is about self-expression,

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:02.646
creativity,

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:07.286
not just overcoming the challenges
posed by the simulation.

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:11.910
It is about showing
what your cities look like.

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:14.726
So I have a couple of videos.

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:16.566
These are from YouTube.

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:21.045
And these are some of the most
interesting city designs I have seen.

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:22.566
So they are all different,

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:24.910
and I hope you like all of these.

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:29.526
This one is called The Netherlands.

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:30.750
It's by Silvarret.

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:33.646
And when you start the game,

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:35.750
you have an empty piece of land.

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:40.206
This land, it can be based
on the real world,

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:43.166
it can be hand-crafted in the map editor,

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:46.166
or you can, of course, download
a city made by someone else

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:47.726
and play in that.

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:50.166
But what Silvarret has done here

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:52.766
is that what he wanted to make

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:55.526
was not a real city.

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:57.206
This is a fantasy city,

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:58.926
even though it looks real.

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:03.790
So what he wanted to do was a fantasy city
that could be in the Netherlands.

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:06.806
So he kind of investigated

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:10.846
what are the characteristics
of cities in the Netherlands

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:13.446
and combined a couple of those,

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:16.166
and this is what he created.

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:17.846
So it is a city,

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:20.126
but it is not a real city,

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:21.406
but it could be.

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:23.110
It looks just like the Netherlands.

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:27.086
So the places are really
densely populated.

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:32.086
So what you need is highways, trains,

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:36.366
anything connecting
these small town centers together.

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:38.606
Lots of people, lots of moving,

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:41.750
so transportation is the key here.

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:46.366
But then let's go even more
on the fantasy side.

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:48.030
Let's go into the future.

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:52.766
This is one of my personal favorites.

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:56.510
These city designs
are what I love the most.

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:00.446
So this is a tiered city by Conflictnerd,

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:05.630
and the basic idea is
that you have concentric circle routes.

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:08.686
So the city is a big circle

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:10.550
with tinier circles inside.

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:15.806
And the thing is that you put
all of the services in the center,

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:19.246
and then people actually live
on the outer ring,

00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:23.046
because there is less traffic,
less noise, less pollution,

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:25.006
so that is where you want to live.

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:27.966
But the services
are still really close by.

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:29.645
They are in the center.

00:04:29.669 --> 00:04:32.830
And this is the soul of the game.

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:35.526
The player has to understand

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:38.126
what are the wishes, what are the needs

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:41.150
of the tiny people living in the cities.

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:45.646
So you need to know
where you should put the things.

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:48.206
Like, it's not enough to have a hospital.

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:49.966
It needs to be accessible.

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:51.870
Citizens need to reach the hospital.

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:57.326
And this is one way to do it.

00:04:57.350 --> 00:05:01.190
So maybe this is something
that we might be seeing someday.

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:05.230
And then even more into the future.

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:08.390
Astergea by Yuttho.

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:12.766
So Yuttho does YouTube videos
and plays the game.

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:17.446
What he did here
was actually a 12-point series

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:19.630
of creating this city.

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:22.686
So what he does is he plays the game,

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:23.966
he records it

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:27.630
and he explains as he's going
what he's doing and why.

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:30.446
And as a part of this series,

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:33.726
he actually did an interview
with an actual urban planner

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:35.550
called Jeff Speck.

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:40.406
And Speck is an expert
on the concept of walkability.

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:44.806
The basic idea is that
if you want your citizens to walk,

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:46.766
which is kind of beneficial,

00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:52.526
you actually need to have walking
as a reasonable means of transportation.

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:55.350
It should be a good way to reach places.

00:05:55.910 --> 00:05:59.526
So what Yuttho did
was that he explained this concept,

00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:01.566
he had Speck explain it, too,

00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:04.550
and then he applied it
to the city that he was building.

00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:10.246
So what we are seeing
is Yuttho's vision of the future:

00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:14.526
lots of public transportation,
walkways, plazas,

00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:16.150
connecting high-rise buildings.

00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:20.526
Maybe this is what
the future might look like.

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:24.006
And the game system
works really well for this.

00:06:24.030 --> 00:06:28.846
We are seeing some
real-world uses to this game.

00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:33.566
So we know that some urban planners
are using it as a sketching tool,

00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:37.886
so while the simulation
is not completely realistic,

00:06:37.910 --> 00:06:41.846
it is realistic enough
that if something works in the game,

00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:46.766
it is highly likely that it
will also work in the real world,

00:06:46.790 --> 00:06:48.886
so that you can actually try out things,

00:06:48.910 --> 00:06:53.886
see if this intersection
might fit this kind of a situation.

00:06:53.910 --> 00:06:57.446
If we build a new road, would it help?

00:06:57.470 --> 00:07:00.430
And this is what you can do
with this game.

00:07:01.230 --> 00:07:04.326
There was one really
interesting contest held

00:07:04.350 --> 00:07:07.030
by the Finnish city of Hämeenlinna.

00:07:07.590 --> 00:07:09.806
So what they did
was that they had a new area

00:07:09.830 --> 00:07:12.230
that they wanted to develop in the city.

00:07:13.110 --> 00:07:15.646
They made a map with the existing city,

00:07:15.670 --> 00:07:18.846
they left empty the area
that they would want to develop

00:07:18.870 --> 00:07:21.206
and shared this map.

00:07:21.230 --> 00:07:24.246
So anyone could download the map,

00:07:24.270 --> 00:07:25.886
play the game, build the area

00:07:25.910 --> 00:07:29.630
and submit their creations
to the city council.

00:07:30.430 --> 00:07:33.046
So they have not yet built anything,

00:07:33.070 --> 00:07:36.846
but it might just be
that they use one of these plans

00:07:36.870 --> 00:07:39.206
made with the game

00:07:39.230 --> 00:07:42.270
to actually build the real city.

00:07:44.230 --> 00:07:46.926
And these videos that I have shown you,

00:07:46.950 --> 00:07:51.550
these are the people who are
coming up with new kinds of solutions.

00:07:52.150 --> 00:07:54.006
We know that cities are growing.

00:07:54.030 --> 00:07:56.486
They're getting bigger as we go,

00:07:56.510 --> 00:08:02.726
and the percentage of population
living in cities is projected to rise.

00:08:02.750 --> 00:08:04.646
So we need the solutions

00:08:04.670 --> 00:08:07.366
and these people, playing the game,

00:08:07.390 --> 00:08:10.046
they are trying out
different kinds of solutions.

00:08:10.070 --> 00:08:13.750
They might have something
that is really important.

00:08:14.790 --> 00:08:21.590
So what we are seeing here is dream cities
that might be real one day.

00:08:22.550 --> 00:08:24.126
So it might be

00:08:24.150 --> 00:08:26.990
that this is not just a game.

00:08:28.150 --> 00:08:30.806
It might be a way

00:08:30.830 --> 00:08:32.990
to decide our own fate.

00:08:34.070 --> 00:08:35.286
Thank you.

00:08:35.310 --> 00:08:38.990
(Applause)
