00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:15.600
I'm going to begin today with a story

00:00:15.624 --> 00:00:17.625
and end with a revolution.

00:00:17.649 --> 00:00:18.984
(Laughter)

00:00:19.008 --> 00:00:20.175
Are you ready?

00:00:20.198 --> 00:00:21.359
Audience: Yes!

00:00:21.383 --> 00:00:23.288
Naomi McDougall-Jones: Here's the story.

00:00:23.312 --> 00:00:25.294
All my life I wanted to be an actress.

00:00:25.318 --> 00:00:28.770
From the time I was very small,
I could feel the magic of storytelling

00:00:28.794 --> 00:00:30.794
and I wanted to be a part of it.

00:00:30.818 --> 00:00:32.550
So, at the ripe age of 21,

00:00:32.574 --> 00:00:35.176
I graduated from the American
Academy of Dramatic Arts

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:36.362
in New York City,

00:00:36.386 --> 00:00:39.554
bright-eyed and bushy-tailed,
and ready to take my rightful place

00:00:39.578 --> 00:00:40.869
as the next Meryl Streep.

00:00:41.812 --> 00:00:43.761
That's my grandmother, not Meryl Streep.

00:00:43.785 --> 00:00:44.793
(Laughter)

00:00:44.817 --> 00:00:47.474
Now, it's important for this story
that you understand

00:00:47.498 --> 00:00:49.499
that I was raised by a raging feminist.

00:00:49.523 --> 00:00:51.429
I mean, just to give you some idea:

00:00:51.453 --> 00:00:55.010
when I was five or six years old
and obsessed with "The Sound of Music,"

00:00:55.034 --> 00:00:57.462
and running around, singing,
"I am 16 going on 17,"

00:00:57.486 --> 00:00:59.058
all day every day,

00:00:59.082 --> 00:01:01.791
my mother sat me down
for a very serious conversation

00:01:01.815 --> 00:01:03.586
and she said, "OK, look.

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:06.646
I'm not going to say
that you can't sing that song,

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:10.225
but if you are going to sing that song,
I do need you to understand

00:01:10.249 --> 00:01:13.268
the extremely problematic
gender construct that it reinforces."

00:01:13.292 --> 00:01:15.370
(Laughter)

00:01:15.394 --> 00:01:17.043
So that's where I come from.

00:01:17.067 --> 00:01:19.434
So it just honestly never
even occurred to me

00:01:19.458 --> 00:01:22.120
that I would be prevented
from doing anything in my life

00:01:22.144 --> 00:01:23.504
because I'm a woman.

00:01:23.528 --> 00:01:24.679
OK. So I graduate.

00:01:24.703 --> 00:01:27.477
And I start auditioning
and I get work, slowly.

00:01:27.501 --> 00:01:30.745
But I just start noticing
that the parts available for women

00:01:30.769 --> 00:01:32.479
are terrible.

00:01:32.503 --> 00:01:34.319
But, remember -- I came here

00:01:34.343 --> 00:01:37.729
to play smart, willful,
complicated, interesting

00:01:37.753 --> 00:01:40.794
complex, confident
female characters, right?

00:01:40.818 --> 00:01:42.298
Like Meryl.

00:01:42.322 --> 00:01:43.730
And all of the sudden,

00:01:43.754 --> 00:01:47.246
I am wrestling with 300 other
gorgeous, talented women

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:48.834
to play ...

00:01:48.858 --> 00:01:50.858
"[Female] No dialogue.

00:01:50.882 --> 00:01:53.309
The character only needs
to stand on a balcony,

00:01:53.333 --> 00:01:55.971
look forlorn, and walk back
inside the house.

00:01:55.995 --> 00:01:57.304
Only partial nudity."

00:01:57.328 --> 00:01:59.060
(Laughter)

00:01:59.084 --> 00:02:01.084
"[Sarah] Brian's love interest.

00:02:01.108 --> 00:02:05.118
Attractive, cute, and flirty,
she is the ideal girl and Brian's prize

00:02:05.142 --> 00:02:06.695
throughout the entire film."

00:02:07.499 --> 00:02:11.210
"[Mom] A proper Southern belle
who is making peace with the fact

00:02:11.234 --> 00:02:14.209
that her only purpose in life
is to tend to her husband."

00:02:14.938 --> 00:02:18.423
"[Abby] Must be OK
with a tastefully shot gang rape,

00:02:18.447 --> 00:02:21.081
along with performing 19th-century dance."

00:02:21.105 --> 00:02:23.294
(Laughter)

00:02:23.318 --> 00:02:25.649
Those are actual casting notices.

00:02:26.617 --> 00:02:29.060
And so I just mentioned this
to my agent one day,

00:02:29.084 --> 00:02:31.801
I say, "I feel like I'm not really
going in for parts

00:02:31.825 --> 00:02:34.284
that I'm actually excited about playing.

00:02:34.308 --> 00:02:37.623
And he said, "Yeah. I don't really know
what to do with you.

00:02:37.647 --> 00:02:39.146
You're too smart for the parts

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:41.350
that are being written
for women in their 20s,

00:02:41.374 --> 00:02:43.989
and you're not quite pretty enough
to be the hot one,

00:02:44.013 --> 00:02:46.013
so I think you'll work when you're 35."

00:02:46.037 --> 00:02:47.468
(Laughter)

00:02:47.492 --> 00:02:48.923
And I said, "Oh. That's funny.

00:02:48.947 --> 00:02:51.960
I always thought that when you were 35,
you were kind of, like,

00:02:51.984 --> 00:02:53.351
over the hill as an actress,

00:02:53.375 --> 00:02:56.151
that you were relegated to playing
20-year-olds' mothers."

00:02:56.175 --> 00:02:57.545
And he said, "Yeah --

00:02:57.569 --> 00:02:59.569
(Laughter)

00:03:00.285 --> 00:03:01.698
It's just the way it is."

00:03:03.087 --> 00:03:05.495
So, maybe a year or so after this,

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:07.789
I'm having lunch
with an actress friend of mine,

00:03:07.813 --> 00:03:09.830
and we're talking about
how insane this is.

00:03:09.854 --> 00:03:12.359
And we decide, you know what? No problem.

00:03:12.383 --> 00:03:13.944
We'll just make our own movie.

00:03:13.968 --> 00:03:17.842
And I'll write and then I'll write it
about two complex female characters.

00:03:17.866 --> 00:03:19.016
So we do.

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:20.519
We set out to make this movie,

00:03:20.543 --> 00:03:24.029
and sort of accidentally, we end up hiring
an all-female production team:

00:03:24.053 --> 00:03:25.653
the writer, directors, producers,

00:03:25.677 --> 00:03:27.237
and it's a film about two women.

00:03:27.261 --> 00:03:29.505
And so pretty soon,
we're sitting in the office

00:03:29.529 --> 00:03:31.106
of a successful male producer,

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:33.593
and he goes, "OK, girls.

00:03:33.617 --> 00:03:36.928
So, you do understand that at some point
you are going to have to hire

00:03:36.952 --> 00:03:38.847
a male producer onboard, right?

00:03:38.871 --> 00:03:41.472
Just so that people
will trust you with their money."

00:03:43.266 --> 00:03:45.444
Over and over again, people tell us,

00:03:45.468 --> 00:03:48.451
"Yeah, but people don't really
want to see films about women,

00:03:48.475 --> 00:03:51.170
so maybe you should think about
making something else.

00:03:51.194 --> 00:03:52.963
It's just the way it is."

00:03:54.311 --> 00:03:56.045
So we make the movie, anyway.

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:58.318
We scrape together 80,000 dollars,

00:03:58.342 --> 00:04:00.722
and we make it, and it does so well.

00:04:00.746 --> 00:04:04.015
It gets into tons of festivals
and we win a lot of awards

00:04:04.039 --> 00:04:06.039
and it's big and exciting.

00:04:06.539 --> 00:04:09.887
But these experiences I've had
just keep rubbing at me.

00:04:09.911 --> 00:04:12.031
And so, I just start talking about them,

00:04:12.055 --> 00:04:14.985
first, at Q and A's after
screenings of the film,

00:04:15.009 --> 00:04:18.081
and then I get invited to be on panels
and talk at conferences.

00:04:18.105 --> 00:04:20.583
And the really amazing thing
is that, to begin with,

00:04:20.607 --> 00:04:22.333
when I'm just talking to audiences

00:04:22.357 --> 00:04:25.225
and other people, you know,
coming up in the film industry,

00:04:25.249 --> 00:04:27.249
the universal reaction is,

00:04:27.273 --> 00:04:30.256
"Oh my god! This is terrible.
What do we do about this?"

00:04:31.052 --> 00:04:33.337
But the bigger panels I get on,

00:04:33.361 --> 00:04:36.059
suddenly an Oscar nominee tells me,

00:04:36.083 --> 00:04:38.619
"Look, I totally agree
with everything you're saying.

00:04:38.643 --> 00:04:41.481
You just need to be really careful
about where you say it."

00:04:42.108 --> 00:04:43.811
An Oscar-winning producer tells me

00:04:43.835 --> 00:04:47.448
that she doesn't think it's a good idea
to play the woman card.

00:04:47.472 --> 00:04:49.018
It's just the way it is.

00:04:50.716 --> 00:04:54.571
And I think this is how
sexism continues on in 2016, right?

00:04:54.595 --> 00:04:57.381
For the most part, it happens casually --

00:04:57.405 --> 00:04:59.078
unconsciously, even.

00:04:59.102 --> 00:05:01.698
It happens because people
are just trying to get along

00:05:01.722 --> 00:05:03.247
within an existing system.

00:05:03.271 --> 00:05:06.593
It happens, maybe, out of a genuine desire

00:05:06.617 --> 00:05:09.643
to teach a young woman
the way that the world "just is."

00:05:10.706 --> 00:05:13.167
The problem is that unless we do
something about it,

00:05:13.191 --> 00:05:15.580
that is the way the world will always be.

00:05:16.778 --> 00:05:18.610
So why should you care about this?

00:05:18.634 --> 00:05:19.789
Right?

00:05:19.813 --> 00:05:23.048
I mean, we're facing some rather
significant problems in the world

00:05:23.072 --> 00:05:24.224
just at present,

00:05:24.248 --> 00:05:26.587
what does it really matter
if I can't get a job,

00:05:26.611 --> 00:05:28.934
or you're stuck watching
"Transformer 17," right?

00:05:28.958 --> 00:05:30.696
(Laughter)

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:33.037
Well, let me put it to you this way:

00:05:33.061 --> 00:05:34.445
the year "Jaws" came out,

00:05:34.469 --> 00:05:39.192
Americans suddenly started listing
"sharks" among their top 10 major fears.

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:45.846
In 1995, BMW paid the James Bond franchise
three million dollars

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:48.763
to have James Bond switch
from driving an Aston Martin

00:05:48.787 --> 00:05:50.407
to a BMW Z3.

00:05:51.272 --> 00:05:55.821
That one move caused so many people
to go out and buy that car,

00:05:55.845 --> 00:06:00.930
that BMW made 240 million dollars
in pre-sales alone.

00:06:01.517 --> 00:06:04.162
The year that "Brave"
and "Hunger Games" came out,

00:06:04.186 --> 00:06:07.603
female participation in archery
went up 105 percent.

00:06:07.627 --> 00:06:10.515
(Laughter)

00:06:10.539 --> 00:06:11.883
In fact, studies show

00:06:11.907 --> 00:06:15.614
that the movies you watch
don't just affect your hobbies,

00:06:15.638 --> 00:06:20.931
they affect your career choices,
your emotions, your sense of identity,

00:06:20.955 --> 00:06:24.939
your relationships, your mental health --
even your marital status.

00:06:26.074 --> 00:06:27.758
So now, consider this:

00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:33.153
if you have watched
mostly American movies in your lifetime,

00:06:33.177 --> 00:06:37.101
95 percent of all the films
you have ever seen

00:06:37.125 --> 00:06:38.872
were directed by men.

00:06:39.657 --> 00:06:43.315
Somewhere between 80 and 90 percent
of all of the leading characters

00:06:43.339 --> 00:06:45.484
that you have ever seen

00:06:45.508 --> 00:06:46.928
were men.

00:06:46.952 --> 00:06:49.931
And even if we just talk about
the last five years,

00:06:49.955 --> 00:06:54.028
55 percent of the time
that you have seen a woman in a movie,

00:06:54.052 --> 00:06:56.669
she was naked or scantily clad.

00:06:57.954 --> 00:06:59.512
That affects you.

00:07:00.099 --> 00:07:01.696
That affects all of us.

00:07:02.465 --> 00:07:05.136
We actually can't even imagine
how much it affects us,

00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:07.134
because this is all we've ever had.

00:07:08.031 --> 00:07:10.697
Stories -- and movies
are just modern stories --

00:07:10.721 --> 00:07:11.984
are not frivolous.

00:07:12.721 --> 00:07:15.474
They're actually the mechanism
through which we process

00:07:15.498 --> 00:07:17.632
our experience of being alive.

00:07:18.195 --> 00:07:20.325
They're the way
that we understand the world

00:07:20.349 --> 00:07:21.781
and our place in it.

00:07:21.805 --> 00:07:23.577
They're the way we develop empathy

00:07:23.601 --> 00:07:26.568
for people who have experiences
different than our own.

00:07:27.210 --> 00:07:30.429
And right now, all of that
is being funneled at us

00:07:30.453 --> 00:07:33.156
through the prism of this one perspective.

00:07:33.180 --> 00:07:35.076
It's not that it's a bad perspective,

00:07:35.100 --> 00:07:37.150
but don't we deserve to hear them all?

00:07:37.936 --> 00:07:41.367
How would the world be different
if all of the stories were told?

00:07:42.001 --> 00:07:43.778
So what do we do about this?

00:07:43.802 --> 00:07:46.921
This may be the first time
a lot of you are hearing about this,

00:07:46.945 --> 00:07:50.449
but a lot of us within the film industry
have spent years --

00:07:50.473 --> 00:07:53.122
a lot of people,
a lot longer than I have --

00:07:53.146 --> 00:07:55.782
giving speeches and doing panels
and writing articles

00:07:55.806 --> 00:07:56.960
and doing studies,

00:07:56.984 --> 00:08:01.053
and really just yelling at Hollywood
to do a better job about this.

00:08:01.077 --> 00:08:04.808
I mean, we have really yelled at them.

00:08:04.832 --> 00:08:08.831
And yet, Paramount and Fox
recently released their slates,

00:08:08.855 --> 00:08:13.487
and of the 47 films that they will release
between now and 2018,

00:08:13.511 --> 00:08:16.930
not a single one
will be directed by a woman.

00:08:19.858 --> 00:08:21.740
So it is beginning to occur to me

00:08:21.764 --> 00:08:24.767
that waiting for Hollywood
to grow a conscience

00:08:24.791 --> 00:08:26.850
may not actually be a winning strategy.

00:08:27.556 --> 00:08:28.751
In fact, it seems to me

00:08:28.775 --> 00:08:31.658
that whenever there is a small,
ruling class of people

00:08:31.682 --> 00:08:34.578
who have all of the money
and power and resources,

00:08:34.602 --> 00:08:37.441
they're not actually that excited
about giving it up.

00:08:38.051 --> 00:08:40.803
And so you don't get change by asking them

00:08:40.827 --> 00:08:42.400
or even yelling at them.

00:08:43.019 --> 00:08:44.977
You have to make that change happen

00:08:45.654 --> 00:08:47.127
through a revolution.

00:08:47.911 --> 00:08:52.419
Now, please don't worry --
I promise you, here, now, today,

00:08:52.443 --> 00:08:54.443
our body count will be very low.

00:08:54.467 --> 00:08:56.696
(Laughter)

00:08:56.720 --> 00:09:00.373
So, now before I get to my four-point
plan for the revolution --

00:09:00.397 --> 00:09:02.038
yes, I have a four-point plan --

00:09:02.062 --> 00:09:04.879
I have two pieces of very good
and important news for you.

00:09:04.903 --> 00:09:06.134
Good news number one:

00:09:06.158 --> 00:09:08.491
there are female filmmakers.

00:09:08.515 --> 00:09:09.768
(Cheers and applause)

00:09:09.792 --> 00:09:11.219
Yes! I know!

00:09:11.243 --> 00:09:12.400
(Applause)

00:09:12.424 --> 00:09:13.637
We exist!

00:09:14.605 --> 00:09:16.708
We actually graduate from film schools

00:09:16.732 --> 00:09:19.055
at the same rate that men
do -- 50 percent.

00:09:19.079 --> 00:09:21.377
So here we have our 50 women.

00:09:21.401 --> 00:09:24.588
The problem is that as soon as you get
to the micro-budget film,

00:09:24.612 --> 00:09:26.173
so even the very smallest films,

00:09:26.197 --> 00:09:28.917
we're already only directing 18 percent.

00:09:29.481 --> 00:09:31.481
Then you get to slightly bigger films,

00:09:31.505 --> 00:09:34.636
indies in the $1-5 million budget range,

00:09:34.660 --> 00:09:36.267
and we go down to 12 percent.

00:09:36.291 --> 00:09:38.794
So by the time you get
to the studio system,

00:09:38.818 --> 00:09:40.929
we're only directing
five percent of movies.

00:09:41.905 --> 00:09:45.201
Now, I know some of you out there
will look at this

00:09:45.225 --> 00:09:47.108
and secretly think to yourselves,

00:09:47.132 --> 00:09:50.091
"Well, maybe women
just aren't as good at directing movies."

00:09:50.717 --> 00:09:52.892
And that's not a totally insane question.

00:09:52.916 --> 00:09:56.273
I mean, we like to believe
the film industry is a meritocracy, right?

00:09:56.297 --> 00:09:57.582
(Laughs)

00:09:57.606 --> 00:09:59.653
(Laughter)

00:09:59.677 --> 00:10:01.425
But look at this trajectory.

00:10:01.449 --> 00:10:02.812
Either you have to accept

00:10:02.836 --> 00:10:07.087
that women are actually
five percent as talented as men,

00:10:07.111 --> 00:10:08.269
which I don't,

00:10:08.293 --> 00:10:11.313
or you have to accept
that there are serious systemic issues

00:10:11.337 --> 00:10:14.150
preventing us from getting
from here to there.

00:10:14.174 --> 00:10:16.589
But the good news is, we exist,

00:10:16.613 --> 00:10:20.048
and there is a vast amount
of untapped potential over here.

00:10:20.952 --> 00:10:24.648
Good news number two,
and this is really good news:

00:10:25.561 --> 00:10:29.495
films by and about women make more money.

00:10:29.519 --> 00:10:32.643
Yes! Yes! It's true!

00:10:32.667 --> 00:10:34.003
(Cheers and applause)

00:10:34.027 --> 00:10:35.671
It's true.

00:10:35.695 --> 00:10:38.014
The Washington Post
recently released a study

00:10:38.038 --> 00:10:42.846
showing that films that feature women
make 23 cents more on every dollar

00:10:42.870 --> 00:10:44.316
than films that don't.

00:10:44.656 --> 00:10:47.220
Furthermore, my colleagues and I
commissioned a study

00:10:47.244 --> 00:10:50.380
comparing 1,700 films
made over the last five years

00:10:50.404 --> 00:10:52.953
and, looking at the average
returns on investment --

00:10:52.977 --> 00:10:55.000
so, how much money does that movie make --

00:10:55.024 --> 00:10:58.374
comparing if a man or a woman
filled each of the following roles:

00:10:58.398 --> 00:11:01.463
director, producer,
screenwriter and lead actor.

00:11:02.034 --> 00:11:04.711
And in every single category,

00:11:04.735 --> 00:11:07.687
the return on investment is higher
if it's a woman.

00:11:08.947 --> 00:11:12.202
Fact: women buy 51 percent
of all movie tickets.

00:11:13.511 --> 00:11:15.625
Films by and about women make more money.

00:11:16.077 --> 00:11:19.019
And of course, at least
some portion of the male population

00:11:19.043 --> 00:11:20.258
does also like women --

00:11:20.282 --> 00:11:23.407
(Laughter)

00:11:23.431 --> 00:11:26.393
so "women films" are not just for women.

00:11:26.900 --> 00:11:31.018
And yet, Hollywood only targets
18 percent of all of their films

00:11:31.042 --> 00:11:32.724
as "women films."

00:11:32.748 --> 00:11:36.818
So what you're left with
is a giant underserved audience

00:11:36.842 --> 00:11:39.207
and untapped profit potential.

00:11:41.087 --> 00:11:44.047
So we exist, and we have stories to tell.

00:11:44.071 --> 00:11:46.459
We have so many stories to tell.

00:11:46.904 --> 00:11:50.599
And despite everything we've heard:
you want to see them.

00:11:51.194 --> 00:11:55.253
The problem is, we've got this thing --
let's call it "Hollywood" --

00:11:55.277 --> 00:11:57.583
(Laughter)

00:11:57.607 --> 00:11:58.825
no, no, I'm just kidding;

00:11:58.849 --> 00:12:01.156
I've met some very nice
people in Hollywood --

00:12:01.180 --> 00:12:04.190
Hollywood, preventing us
from getting to you.

00:12:04.214 --> 00:12:06.502
So here is my four-point plan
for the revolution,

00:12:06.526 --> 00:12:09.896
and everybody -- man or woman,
in this room or anywhere in the world --

00:12:09.920 --> 00:12:11.129
is going to get to help.

00:12:11.153 --> 00:12:13.769
And this revolution is not just for women.

00:12:13.793 --> 00:12:15.975
Anyone who has been disenfranchised,

00:12:15.999 --> 00:12:18.355
anyone whose story has not been told,

00:12:18.934 --> 00:12:20.214
the same principles apply,

00:12:20.238 --> 00:12:22.844
and I really hope we can do
the revolution together.

00:12:24.542 --> 00:12:25.760
My four-point plan.

00:12:26.521 --> 00:12:29.117
Number one: watch movies.

00:12:29.141 --> 00:12:30.625
Isn't this a good revolution?

00:12:30.649 --> 00:12:31.719
(Laughter)

00:12:31.743 --> 00:12:34.302
OK, first I want to talk to anyone
who watches movies.

00:12:34.326 --> 00:12:35.960
Who watches movies in here?

00:12:35.984 --> 00:12:37.135
Great!

00:12:37.159 --> 00:12:41.164
Will you pledge to watch one film
by a female filmmaker per month?

00:12:41.188 --> 00:12:43.259
That's it, just start there. Great!

00:12:43.283 --> 00:12:44.849
If you need help finding them,

00:12:44.873 --> 00:12:47.810
you can go to the website, moviesbyher.com

00:12:48.159 --> 00:12:52.045
It's an easily searchable database
of films by women.

00:12:52.933 --> 00:12:55.265
And as you start watching all movies,

00:12:55.289 --> 00:12:58.137
I just want you to pay attention
to the female characters.

00:12:58.161 --> 00:12:59.458
How many of them are there?

00:12:59.482 --> 00:13:00.671
What are they wearing?

00:13:00.695 --> 00:13:02.150
Or not?

00:13:02.174 --> 00:13:03.626
Do they get to do cool things,

00:13:03.650 --> 00:13:06.309
or are they just there
to emotionally support the men?

00:13:07.363 --> 00:13:11.054
I'm telling you, once you see this,
you're not going to be able to unsee it.

00:13:11.078 --> 00:13:14.660
And as you start noticing this,
it's going to shift your viewing habits.

00:13:14.684 --> 00:13:17.922
And this already sizable market
is going to continue to grow.

00:13:18.605 --> 00:13:21.027
Step two: make movies.

00:13:21.511 --> 00:13:24.987
So now I'm talking to all
the female filmmakers out there:

00:13:25.011 --> 00:13:27.312
we need you to be very brave.

00:13:27.891 --> 00:13:30.146
It will be harder for you to make movies.

00:13:30.764 --> 00:13:34.137
In fact, there will be an entire industry
constantly telling you

00:13:34.161 --> 00:13:35.827
that your stories don't matter.

00:13:36.430 --> 00:13:38.430
And we need you to make them, anyway.

00:13:38.874 --> 00:13:42.858
That 18 percent in the micro-budget
range -- that is on us to fix.

00:13:43.284 --> 00:13:45.284
Don't wait for permission.

00:13:45.308 --> 00:13:47.308
Don't wait for somebody to pick you,

00:13:47.332 --> 00:13:49.769
because 95 percent says
they are not going to.

00:13:50.419 --> 00:13:51.574
Crowd fund.

00:13:51.598 --> 00:13:53.476
Write letters to eccentric relatives.

00:13:53.500 --> 00:13:54.866
I know how hard it is,

00:13:54.890 --> 00:13:59.578
but you have to make your movies --
now, today, features, not shorts.

00:13:59.602 --> 00:14:03.345
There is an audience for them,
and they want and need to see them.

00:14:04.471 --> 00:14:07.017
Three: invest in each other.

00:14:08.040 --> 00:14:12.008
Fellow female filmmakers, I feel like
we need to stop wasting so much energy

00:14:12.032 --> 00:14:14.095
on a system that does not want us.

00:14:14.119 --> 00:14:17.725
We need to find our audience
and invest in cultivating them.

00:14:17.749 --> 00:14:19.982
If we can figure out
how to make our movies

00:14:20.006 --> 00:14:22.490
and deliver them
to the audiences that want them,

00:14:22.514 --> 00:14:23.674
that's it.

00:14:23.698 --> 00:14:25.063
That's the whole game.

00:14:25.087 --> 00:14:27.053
And whatever they're doing in the middle

00:14:27.077 --> 00:14:29.348
is going to cease to be
quite so important.

00:14:29.372 --> 00:14:31.832
Audiences, invest in us.

00:14:32.443 --> 00:14:35.381
Help us make the movies
that you want to see.

00:14:35.405 --> 00:14:39.344
If you can give a female filmmaker
25 dollars in a crowdfunding campaign,

00:14:39.368 --> 00:14:40.644
great, do that.

00:14:40.668 --> 00:14:42.265
If you can invest more seriously

00:14:42.289 --> 00:14:44.803
and help us over that critical
million-dollar hurdle,

00:14:44.827 --> 00:14:45.994
do that.

00:14:46.018 --> 00:14:48.757
But invest in seeing
the other half of the story.

00:14:50.725 --> 00:14:52.832
Four: disrupt through business.

00:14:53.502 --> 00:14:55.943
So now I'm talking
to all of the businesspeople

00:14:55.967 --> 00:14:57.275
and entrepreneurs.

00:14:57.299 --> 00:14:59.713
This does not happen
very often in the world,

00:14:59.737 --> 00:15:02.333
but right here we have a golden situation

00:15:02.357 --> 00:15:05.178
in which you can enact
significant social change

00:15:05.202 --> 00:15:07.202
while also making money.

00:15:08.424 --> 00:15:11.344
Hollywood is a system ripe for disruption.

00:15:11.368 --> 00:15:14.342
The old models of financing
and distribution are crumbling --

00:15:14.366 --> 00:15:16.419
please come in and disrupt it.

00:15:17.104 --> 00:15:18.744
I'll give you an example.

00:15:18.768 --> 00:15:20.718
Right now, with some incredible women,

00:15:20.742 --> 00:15:22.931
I am launching the "The 51 Fund."

00:15:22.955 --> 00:15:24.438
It's a venture capital fund

00:15:24.462 --> 00:15:27.789
that will finance films written, directed
and produced by women

00:15:27.813 --> 00:15:30.501
in that critical $1-5 million range.

00:15:31.207 --> 00:15:33.906
We will give a significant number
of female filmmakers

00:15:33.930 --> 00:15:35.465
the chance to make their movies

00:15:35.489 --> 00:15:38.224
and we will deliver them
to the audiences who want them.

00:15:38.248 --> 00:15:40.862
Good for equality, good for business.

00:15:41.869 --> 00:15:44.035
But that's only one example, we need more.

00:15:44.059 --> 00:15:46.170
There is room for so many more.

00:15:46.194 --> 00:15:47.548
So I say to you:

00:15:47.572 --> 00:15:49.777
Hollywood is leaving money on the table.

00:15:50.223 --> 00:15:51.528
Come pick it up.

00:15:52.511 --> 00:15:56.893
(Applause)

00:15:56.917 --> 00:16:00.947
Now, all of this may seem like a lot,
but it is actually so doable.

00:16:00.971 --> 00:16:04.614
Entrenched systems don't change
because you ask the people in charge,

00:16:04.638 --> 00:16:07.874
they change because all of the people
who don't have what they want

00:16:07.898 --> 00:16:09.977
rise up and make that change happen.

00:16:10.541 --> 00:16:12.012
And don't you want to?

00:16:12.670 --> 00:16:16.781
I want to see what the other
51 percent of the population has to say.

00:16:17.487 --> 00:16:19.880
I want to watch movies
that teach me about people

00:16:19.904 --> 00:16:21.291
who are different than I am.

00:16:21.830 --> 00:16:25.848
I want to see women's bodies on film
that aren't perfect.

00:16:26.387 --> 00:16:28.650
I want to give our little boys the chance

00:16:28.674 --> 00:16:30.533
to empathize with female characters

00:16:30.557 --> 00:16:32.888
so that they can become more whole men.

00:16:33.531 --> 00:16:35.660
And I definitely want
to give a little girl

00:16:35.684 --> 00:16:37.641
who may not have a real-life role model

00:16:37.665 --> 00:16:39.025
the chance to watch movies

00:16:39.049 --> 00:16:41.822
and see women doing everything
she dreams of achieving.

00:16:42.678 --> 00:16:45.367
This is not about
making one industry better.

00:16:45.874 --> 00:16:47.874
This is about making a better world.

00:16:48.635 --> 00:16:49.928
Will you help?

00:16:51.055 --> 00:16:52.795
The time for waiting is over.

00:16:52.819 --> 00:16:55.065
The time for the revolution is now.

00:16:55.089 --> 00:16:59.808
(Cheers and applause)
