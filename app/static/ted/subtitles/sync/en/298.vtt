00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:30.150
♫ Picture yourself in a world where there's no one else, ♫

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:33.150
♫ nobody anywhere. ♫

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:41.150
♫ A moment ago, there were voices and faces to look upon, ♫

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:44.150
♫ you can't see them anywhere. ♫

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:47.150
♫ Nothing more to say ♫

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:52.150
♫ and no one left to say it to, anyway. ♫

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:56.150
♫ Oh, listen to what I say. ♫

00:00:56.150 --> 00:01:01.150
♫ Everybody can be somebody ♫

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:06.150
♫ and everybody is free to make a difference. ♫

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:12.150
♫ Everybody can be somebody. ♫

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:20.150
♫ Everybody is free to make a difference in this world. ♫

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:28.150
♫ Now picture a world where the people all feel their worth. ♫

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:32.150
♫ Children are everywhere. ♫

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:38.150
♫ Now there is a reason for everyone's time on Earth. ♫

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:43.150
♫ Wondering why you should care, yeah. ♫

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:46.150
♫ Nothing more to say ♫

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:51.150
♫ and only love can see us through, anyway. ♫

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:54.150
♫ Oh, listen what I say, yeah. ♫

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:59.150
♫ Everybody can be somebody ♫

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:05.150
♫ and everybody is free to make a difference. ♫

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:10.150
♫ Everybody can be somebody. ♫

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:15.150
♫ Everybody is free to make a difference. ♫

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:20.150
♫ You don't have to be a big celebrity ♫

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:25.150
♫ to feel the power, the power in your soul, no. ♫

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:30.150
♫ You don't have to be a big star on MTV ♫

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:35.150
♫ to realize that in your eyes is a view that only you can see. ♫

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:40.150
♫ Everybody can be somebody. ♫

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:46.150
♫ Everybody is free to make a difference in this world. ♫

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:51.150
♫ You can make a little difference in this world. ♫

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:56.150
♫ I can make a little difference in this world. ♫

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:01.150
♫ She can make a little difference in this world. ♫

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:06.150
♫ He can make a little difference in this world. ♫

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:09.150
♫ You can, I can, she can, he can, ♫

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:14.150
♫ we can make a little bit of difference in this world. ♫

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:19.150
♫ Everybody gonna make a little ♫

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:24.150
♫ little difference, yeah. ♫

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:35.150
♫ Talking 'bout everybody gonna make a little difference. ♫

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:48.150
♫ Everybody gonna make a little difference in this world, ♫

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:54.150
♫ oh yeah. ♫

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:05.150
(Applause)

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:07.150
Thank you so much.

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:08.150
(Applause)

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:12.150
This is a song that came about

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:16.150
because I think it's difficult to be in the world

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:18.150
and not be aware of what's going on,

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:23.150
and the wars and so forth.

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:27.150
This song kind of came out of all of that.

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:34.150
And I wrote a lot of happy songs on my first record,

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:36.150
which I still stand by,

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:38.150
but this has got something else in it.

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:41.150
It's called "Peace on Earth."

00:04:57.150 --> 00:05:00.150
♫ There is no hope. ♫

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:03.150
♫ There is no future. ♫

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:07.150
♫ No faith in God to save the day. ♫

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:11.150
♫ There is no reason, no understanding ♫

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:15.150
♫ no sacred place to hide away. ♫

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:20.150
♫ There is no earnest conversation. ♫

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:24.150
♫ No words of wisdom from the wise. ♫

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:28.150
♫ There is no reconciliation ♫

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:33.150
♫ and no collective compromise. ♫

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:35.150
♫ Peace on Earth, ♫

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:37.150
♫ that's what we want. ♫

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:39.150
♫ Peace on Earth, ♫

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:42.150
♫ that's what we all say. ♫

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:44.150
♫ Peace on Earth. ♫

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:48.150
♫ Yet, there in the hallway ♫

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:56.150
♫ lurks the ghost of war. ♫

00:05:56.150 --> 00:06:01.150
♫ He wants more, and more, and more, and more, ♫

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:06.150
♫ and more, and more, and more, and more. ♫

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:09.150
♫ There is no darkness, no sunshine. ♫

00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:13.150
♫ There is no great society. ♫

00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:18.150
♫ There is no freedom without conviction. ♫

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:22.150
♫ There is no freedom to be free. ♫

00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:26.150
♫ There is no heaven, no fire and brimstone. ♫

00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:31.150
♫ There is no brotherhood of man. ♫

00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:35.150
♫ There is no country, no one religion. ♫

00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:39.150
♫ There is no universal plan. ♫

00:06:39.150 --> 00:06:42.150
♫ Peace on Earth, ♫

00:06:42.150 --> 00:06:44.150
♫ that's what we want. ♫

00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:46.150
♫ Peace on Earth, ♫

00:06:46.150 --> 00:06:48.150
♫ that's what we all say. ♫

00:06:48.150 --> 00:06:50.150
♫ Peace on Earth. ♫

00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:55.150
♫ Yet, there in the hallway ♫

00:06:55.150 --> 00:07:01.150
♫ lurks the ghost of war. ♫

00:07:01.150 --> 00:07:08.150
♫ He wants more, and more, and more, and more, ♫

00:07:08.150 --> 00:07:11.150
♫ and more, and more, and more, and more, and more. ♫

00:07:11.150 --> 00:07:13.150
♫ The answer is ♫

00:07:13.150 --> 00:07:20.150
♫ mutual-assured destruction, ♫

00:07:22.150 --> 00:07:25.150
♫ a balance of power, ♫

00:07:26.150 --> 00:07:29.150
♫ a weapon for everyone. ♫

00:07:29.150 --> 00:07:37.150
♫ Mutual-assured destruction ♫

00:07:37.150 --> 00:07:47.150
♫ bringing peace to everyone. ♫

00:07:52.150 --> 00:07:59.150
(Trumpet sounds)

00:08:01.150 --> 00:08:40.150
(Trumpet sounds)

00:08:40.150 --> 00:08:42.150
♫ Peace on Earth, ♫

00:08:42.150 --> 00:08:45.150
♫ that's what we want. ♫

00:08:45.150 --> 00:08:47.150
♫ Peace on Earth, ♫

00:08:47.150 --> 00:08:49.150
♫ that's what we all say. ♫

00:08:49.150 --> 00:08:51.150
♫ Peace on Earth. ♫

00:08:51.150 --> 00:08:53.150
♫ There in the hallway, ♫

00:08:53.150 --> 00:08:57.150
♫ peace on Earth. ♫

00:08:57.150 --> 00:09:01.150
♫ Peace on Earth. ♫

00:09:01.150 --> 00:09:09.150
♫ Peace on Earth. ♫

00:09:09.150 --> 00:09:14.150
(Applause)
