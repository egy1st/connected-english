00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:17.150
I got my first computer when I was a teenager growing up in Accra,

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:20.150
and it was a really cool device.

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:25.150
You could play games with it. You could program it in BASIC.

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:27.150
And I was fascinated.

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:33.150
So I went into the library to figure out how did this thing work.

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:38.150
I read about how the CPU is constantly shuffling data back and forth

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:42.150
between the memory, the RAM and the ALU,

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:44.150
the arithmetic and logic unit.

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:48.150
And I thought to myself, this CPU really has to work like crazy

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:52.150
just to keep all this data moving through the system.

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:55.150
But nobody was really worried about this.

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:57.150
When computers were first introduced,

00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:00.150
they were said to be a million times faster than neurons.

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:05.150
People were really excited. They thought they would soon outstrip

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:08.150
the capacity of the brain.

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:11.150
This is a quote, actually, from Alan Turing:

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:15.150
"In 30 years, it will be as easy to ask a computer a question

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.150
as to ask a person."

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:24.150
This was in 1946. And now, in 2007, it's still not true.

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:28.150
And so, the question is, why aren't we really seeing

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:32.150
this kind of power in computers that we see in the brain?

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:36.150
What people didn't realize, and I'm just beginning to realize right now,

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.150
is that we pay a huge price for the speed

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:42.150
that we claim is a big advantage of these computers.

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.150
Let's take a look at some numbers.

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:48.150
This is Blue Gene, the fastest computer in the world.

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:53.150
It's got 120,000 processors; they can basically process

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:56.150
10 quadrillion bits of information per second.

00:01:56.150 --> 00:02:03.150
That's 10 to the sixteenth. And they consume one and a half megawatts of power.

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:06.150
So that would be really great, if you could add that

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:08.150
to the production capacity in Tanzania.

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:10.150
It would really boost the economy.

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:14.150
Just to go back to the States,

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:16.150
if you translate the amount of power or electricity

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:19.150
this computer uses to the amount of households in the States,

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:23.150
you get 1,200 households in the U.S.

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:25.150
That's how much power this computer uses.

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:28.150
Now, let's compare this with the brain.

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:33.150
This is a picture of, actually Rory Sayres' girlfriend's brain.

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:35.150
Rory is a graduate student at Stanford.

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:39.150
He studies the brain using MRI, and he claims that

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:42.150
this is the most beautiful brain that he has ever scanned.

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:44.150
(Laughter)

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:47.150
So that's true love, right there.

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:50.150
Now, how much computation does the brain do?

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:52.150
I estimate 10 to the 16 bits per second,

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:56.150
which is actually about very similar to what Blue Gene does.

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:58.150
So that's the question. The question is, how much --

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:01.150
they are doing a similar amount of processing, similar amount of data --

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:06.150
the question is how much energy or electricity does the brain use?

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:09.150
And it's actually as much as your laptop computer:

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:11.150
it's just 10 watts.

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:14.150
So what we are doing right now with computers

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:17.150
with the energy consumed by 1,200 houses,

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:22.150
the brain is doing with the energy consumed by your laptop.

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:25.150
So the question is, how is the brain able to achieve this kind of efficiency?

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:27.150
And let me just summarize. So the bottom line:

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:31.150
the brain processes information using 100,000 times less energy

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:35.150
than we do right now with this computer technology that we have.

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:37.150
How is the brain able to do this?

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:40.150
Let's just take a look about how the brain works,

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:44.150
and then I'll compare that with how computers work.

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:48.150
So, this clip is from the PBS series, "The Secret Life of the Brain."

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:51.150
It shows you these cells that process information.

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:52.150
They are called neurons.

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:58.150
They send little pulses of electricity down their processes to each other,

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:00.150
and where they contact each other, those little pulses

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:02.150
of electricity can jump from one neuron to the other.

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:05.150
That process is called a synapse.

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:07.150
You've got this huge network of cells interacting with each other --

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:09.150
about 100 million of them,

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:13.150
sending about 10 quadrillion of these pulses around every second.

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:19.150
And that's basically what's going on in your brain right now as you're watching this.

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:21.150
How does that compare with the way computers work?

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:23.150
In the computer, you have all the data

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:25.150
going through the central processing unit,

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:28.150
and any piece of data basically has to go through that bottleneck,

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:32.150
whereas in the brain, what you have is these neurons,

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:36.150
and the data just really flows through a network of connections

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:38.150
among the neurons. There's no bottleneck here.

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:42.150
It's really a network in the literal sense of the word.

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:46.150
The net is doing the work in the brain.

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:48.150
If you just look at these two pictures,

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:50.150
these kind of words pop into your mind.

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:54.150
This is serial and it's rigid -- it's like cars on a freeway,

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:57.150
everything has to happen in lockstep --

00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:59.150
whereas this is parallel and it's fluid.

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:02.150
Information processing is very dynamic and adaptive.

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:06.150
So I'm not the first to figure this out. This is a quote from Brian Eno:

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:10.150
"the problem with computers is that there is not enough Africa in them."

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:16.150
(Laughter)

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:19.150
Brian actually said this in 1995.

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:22.150
And nobody was listening then,

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:24.150
but now people are beginning to listen

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:29.150
because there's a pressing, technological problem that we face.

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:34.150
And I'll just take you through that a little bit in the next few slides.

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:38.150
This is -- it's actually really this remarkable convergence

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:43.150
between the devices that we use to compute in computers,

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:47.150
and the devices that our brains use to compute.

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:51.150
The devices that computers use are what's called a transistor.

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:55.150
This electrode here, called the gate, controls the flow of current

00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:58.150
from the source to the drain -- these two electrodes.

00:05:58.150 --> 00:06:00.150
And that current, electrical current,

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:06.150
is carried by electrons, just like in your house and so on.

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:11.150
And what you have here is, when you actually turn on the gate,

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:15.150
you get an increase in the amount of current, and you get a steady flow of current.

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:19.150
And when you turn off the gate, there's no current flowing through the device.

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:24.150
Your computer uses this presence of current to represent a one,

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:28.150
and the absence of current to represent a zero.

00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:34.150
Now, what's happening is that as transistors are getting smaller and smaller and smaller,

00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:36.150
they no longer behave like this.

00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:41.150
In fact, they are starting to behave like the device that neurons use to compute,

00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:43.150
which is called an ion channel.

00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:45.150
And this is a little protein molecule.

00:06:45.150 --> 00:06:49.150
I mean, neurons have thousands of these.

00:06:49.150 --> 00:06:53.150
And it sits in the membrane of the cell and it's got a pore in it.

00:06:53.150 --> 00:06:56.150
And these are individual potassium ions

00:06:56.150 --> 00:06:58.150
that are flowing through that pore.

00:06:58.150 --> 00:07:00.150
Now, this pore can open and close.

00:07:00.150 --> 00:07:05.150
But, when it's open, because these ions have to line up

00:07:05.150 --> 00:07:10.150
and flow through, one at a time, you get a kind of sporadic, not steady --

00:07:10.150 --> 00:07:13.150
it's a sporadic flow of current.

00:07:13.150 --> 00:07:16.150
And even when you close the pore -- which neurons can do,

00:07:16.150 --> 00:07:21.150
they can open and close these pores to generate electrical activity --

00:07:21.150 --> 00:07:24.150
even when it's closed, because these ions are so small,

00:07:24.150 --> 00:07:27.150
they can actually sneak through, a few can sneak through at a time.

00:07:27.150 --> 00:07:30.150
So, what you have is that when the pore is open,

00:07:30.150 --> 00:07:32.150
you get some current sometimes.

00:07:32.150 --> 00:07:35.150
These are your ones, but you've got a few zeros thrown in.

00:07:35.150 --> 00:07:39.150
And when it's closed, you have a zero,

00:07:39.150 --> 00:07:42.150
but you have a few ones thrown in.

00:07:42.150 --> 00:07:45.150
Now, this is starting to happen in transistors.

00:07:45.150 --> 00:07:50.150
And the reason why that's happening is that, right now, in 2007 --

00:07:50.150 --> 00:07:54.150
the technology that we are using -- a transistor is big enough

00:07:54.150 --> 00:07:59.150
that several electrons can flow through the channel simultaneously, side by side.

00:07:59.150 --> 00:08:03.150
In fact, there's about 12 electrons can all be flowing this way.

00:08:03.150 --> 00:08:05.150
And that means that a transistor corresponds

00:08:05.150 --> 00:08:08.150
to about 12 ion channels in parallel.

00:08:08.150 --> 00:08:13.150
Now, in a few years time, by 2015, we will shrink transistors so much.

00:08:13.150 --> 00:08:18.150
This is what Intel does to keep adding more cores onto the chip.

00:08:18.150 --> 00:08:21.150
Or your memory sticks that you have now can carry one gigabyte

00:08:21.150 --> 00:08:23.150
of stuff on them -- before, it was 256.

00:08:23.150 --> 00:08:26.150
Transistors are getting smaller to allow this to happen,

00:08:26.150 --> 00:08:29.150
and technology has really benefitted from that.

00:08:29.150 --> 00:08:34.150
But what's happening now is that in 2015, the transistor is going to become so small,

00:08:34.150 --> 00:08:37.150
that it corresponds to only one electron at a time

00:08:37.150 --> 00:08:39.150
can flow through that channel,

00:08:39.150 --> 00:08:41.150
and that corresponds to a single ion channel.

00:08:41.150 --> 00:08:45.150
And you start having the same kind of traffic jams that you have in the ion channel.

00:08:45.150 --> 00:08:48.150
The current will turn on and off at random,

00:08:48.150 --> 00:08:50.150
even when it's supposed to be on.

00:08:50.150 --> 00:08:52.150
And that means your computer is going to get

00:08:52.150 --> 00:08:56.150
its ones and zeros mixed up, and that's going to crash your machine.

00:08:56.150 --> 00:09:00.150
So, we are at the stage where we

00:09:00.150 --> 00:09:03.150
don't really know how to compute with these kinds of devices.

00:09:03.150 --> 00:09:06.150
And the only kind of thing -- the only thing we know right now

00:09:06.150 --> 00:09:09.150
that can compute with these kinds of devices are the brain.

00:09:09.150 --> 00:09:13.150
OK, so a computer picks a specific item of data from memory,

00:09:13.150 --> 00:09:16.150
it sends it into the processor or the ALU,

00:09:16.150 --> 00:09:18.150
and then it puts the result back into memory.

00:09:18.150 --> 00:09:20.150
That's the red path that's highlighted.

00:09:20.150 --> 00:09:24.150
The way brains work, I told you all, you have got all these neurons.

00:09:24.150 --> 00:09:26.150
And the way they represent information is

00:09:26.150 --> 00:09:28.150
they break up that data into little pieces

00:09:28.150 --> 00:09:31.150
that are represented by pulses and different neurons.

00:09:31.150 --> 00:09:33.150
So you have all these pieces of data

00:09:33.150 --> 00:09:35.150
distributed throughout the network.

00:09:35.150 --> 00:09:38.150
And then the way that you process that data to get a result

00:09:38.150 --> 00:09:42.150
is that you translate this pattern of activity into a new pattern of activity,

00:09:42.150 --> 00:09:45.150
just by it flowing through the network.

00:09:45.150 --> 00:09:47.150
So you set up these connections

00:09:47.150 --> 00:09:50.150
such that the input pattern just flows

00:09:50.150 --> 00:09:52.150
and generates the output pattern.

00:09:52.150 --> 00:09:56.150
What you see here is that there's these redundant connections.

00:09:56.150 --> 00:10:00.150
So if this piece of data or this piece of the data gets clobbered,

00:10:00.150 --> 00:10:05.150
it doesn't show up over here, these two pieces can activate the missing part

00:10:05.150 --> 00:10:07.150
with these redundant connections.

00:10:07.150 --> 00:10:09.150
So even when you go to these crappy devices

00:10:09.150 --> 00:10:12.150
where sometimes you want a one and you get a zero, and it doesn't show up,

00:10:12.150 --> 00:10:14.150
there's redundancy in the network

00:10:14.150 --> 00:10:17.150
that can actually recover the missing information.

00:10:17.150 --> 00:10:20.150
It makes the brain inherently robust.

00:10:20.150 --> 00:10:23.150
What you have here is a system where you store data locally.

00:10:23.150 --> 00:10:27.150
And it's brittle, because each of these steps has to be flawless,

00:10:27.150 --> 00:10:30.150
otherwise you lose that data, whereas in the brain, you have a system

00:10:30.150 --> 00:10:34.150
that stores data in a distributed way, and it's robust.

00:10:34.150 --> 00:10:38.150
What I want to basically talk about is my dream,

00:10:38.150 --> 00:10:41.150
which is to build a computer that works like the brain.

00:10:41.150 --> 00:10:45.150
This is something that we've been working on for the last couple of years.

00:10:45.150 --> 00:10:48.150
And I'm going to show you a system that we designed

00:10:48.150 --> 00:10:51.150
to model the retina,

00:10:51.150 --> 00:10:56.150
which is a piece of brain that lines the inside of your eyeball.

00:10:56.150 --> 00:11:02.150
We didn't do this by actually writing code, like you do in a computer.

00:11:02.150 --> 00:11:05.150
In fact, the processing that happens

00:11:05.150 --> 00:11:07.150
in that little piece of brain is very similar

00:11:07.150 --> 00:11:08.150
to the kind of processing that computers

00:11:08.150 --> 00:11:12.150
do when they stream video over the Internet.

00:11:12.150 --> 00:11:13.150
They want to compress the information --

00:11:13.150 --> 00:11:17.150
they just want to send the changes, what's new in the image, and so on --

00:11:17.150 --> 00:11:20.150
and that is how your eyeball

00:11:20.150 --> 00:11:23.150
is able to squeeze all that information down to your optic nerve,

00:11:23.150 --> 00:11:25.150
to send to the rest of the brain.

00:11:25.150 --> 00:11:28.150
Instead of doing this in software, or doing those kinds of algorithms,

00:11:28.150 --> 00:11:31.150
we went and talked to neurobiologists

00:11:31.150 --> 00:11:35.150
who have actually reverse engineered that piece of brain that's called the retina.

00:11:35.150 --> 00:11:37.150
And they figured out all the different cells,

00:11:37.150 --> 00:11:40.150
and they figured out the network, and we just took that network

00:11:40.150 --> 00:11:44.150
and we used it as the blueprint for the design of a silicon chip.

00:11:44.150 --> 00:11:50.150
So now the neurons are represented by little nodes or circuits on the chip,

00:11:50.150 --> 00:11:55.150
and the connections among the neurons are represented, actually modeled by transistors.

00:11:55.150 --> 00:11:57.150
And these transistors are behaving essentially

00:11:57.150 --> 00:12:00.150
just like ion channels behave in the brain.

00:12:00.150 --> 00:12:05.150
It will give you the same kind of robust architecture that I described.

00:12:05.150 --> 00:12:09.150
Here is actually what our artificial eye looks like.

00:12:09.150 --> 00:12:14.150
The retina chip that we designed sits behind this lens here.

00:12:14.150 --> 00:12:16.150
And the chip -- I'm going to show you a video

00:12:16.150 --> 00:12:19.150
that the silicon retina put out of its output

00:12:19.150 --> 00:12:22.150
when it was looking at Kareem Zaghloul,

00:12:22.150 --> 00:12:24.150
who's the student who designed this chip.

00:12:24.150 --> 00:12:26.150
Let me explain what you're going to see, OK,

00:12:26.150 --> 00:12:29.150
because it's putting out different kinds of information,

00:12:29.150 --> 00:12:31.150
it's not as straightforward as a camera.

00:12:31.150 --> 00:12:34.150
The retina chip extracts four different kinds of information.

00:12:34.150 --> 00:12:37.150
It extracts regions with dark contrast,

00:12:37.150 --> 00:12:40.150
which will show up on the video as red.

00:12:40.150 --> 00:12:44.150
And it extracts regions with white or light contrast,

00:12:44.150 --> 00:12:46.150
which will show up on the video as green.

00:12:46.150 --> 00:12:48.150
This is Kareem's dark eyes

00:12:48.150 --> 00:12:51.150
and that's the white background that you see here.

00:12:51.150 --> 00:12:53.150
And then it also extracts movement.

00:12:53.150 --> 00:12:55.150
When Kareem moves his head to the right,

00:12:55.150 --> 00:12:57.150
you will see this blue activity there;

00:12:57.150 --> 00:13:00.150
it represents regions where the contrast is increasing in the image,

00:13:00.150 --> 00:13:03.150
that's where it's going from dark to light.

00:13:03.150 --> 00:13:05.150
And you also see this yellow activity,

00:13:05.150 --> 00:13:09.150
which represents regions where contrast is decreasing;

00:13:09.150 --> 00:13:11.150
it's going from light to dark.

00:13:11.150 --> 00:13:14.150
And these four types of information --

00:13:14.150 --> 00:13:18.150
your optic nerve has about a million fibers in it,

00:13:18.150 --> 00:13:21.150
and 900,000 of those fibers

00:13:21.150 --> 00:13:23.150
send these four types of information.

00:13:23.150 --> 00:13:27.150
So we are really duplicating the kind of signals that you have on the optic nerve.

00:13:27.150 --> 00:13:30.150
What you notice here is that these snapshots

00:13:30.150 --> 00:13:34.150
taken from the output of the retina chip are very sparse, right?

00:13:34.150 --> 00:13:36.150
It doesn't light up green everywhere in the background,

00:13:36.150 --> 00:13:39.150
only on the edges, and then in the hair, and so on.

00:13:39.150 --> 00:13:40.150
And this is the same thing you see

00:13:40.150 --> 00:13:44.150
when people compress video to send: they want to make it very sparse,

00:13:44.150 --> 00:13:47.150
because that file is smaller. And this is what the retina is doing,

00:13:47.150 --> 00:13:51.150
and it's doing it just with the circuitry, and how this network of neurons

00:13:51.150 --> 00:13:54.150
that are interacting in there, which we've captured on the chip.

00:13:54.150 --> 00:13:57.150
But the point that I want to make -- I'll show you up here.

00:13:57.150 --> 00:14:00.150
So this image here is going to look like these ones,

00:14:00.150 --> 00:14:02.150
but here I'll show you that we can reconstruct the image,

00:14:02.150 --> 00:14:07.150
so, you know, you can almost recognize Kareem in that top part there.

00:14:07.150 --> 00:14:09.150
And so, here you go.

00:14:18.150 --> 00:14:21.150
Yes, so that's the idea.

00:14:21.150 --> 00:14:23.150
When you stand still, you just see the light and dark contrasts.

00:14:23.150 --> 00:14:25.150
But when it's moving back and forth,

00:14:25.150 --> 00:14:28.150
the retina picks up these changes.

00:14:28.150 --> 00:14:29.150
And that's why, you know, when you're sitting here

00:14:29.150 --> 00:14:31.150
and something happens in your background,

00:14:31.150 --> 00:14:33.150
you merely move your eyes to it.

00:14:33.150 --> 00:14:35.150
There are these cells that detect change

00:14:35.150 --> 00:14:37.150
and you move your attention to it.

00:14:37.150 --> 00:14:39.150
So those are very important for catching somebody

00:14:39.150 --> 00:14:41.150
who's trying to sneak up on you.

00:14:41.150 --> 00:14:44.150
Let me just end by saying that this is what happens

00:14:44.150 --> 00:14:47.150
when you put Africa in a piano, OK.

00:14:47.150 --> 00:14:50.150
This is a steel drum here that has been modified,

00:14:50.150 --> 00:14:53.150
and that's what happens when you put Africa in a piano.

00:14:53.150 --> 00:14:57.150
And what I would like us to do is put Africa in the computer,

00:14:57.150 --> 00:14:59.150
and come up with a new kind of computer

00:14:59.150 --> 00:15:02.150
that will generate thought, imagination, be creative and things like that.

00:15:02.150 --> 00:15:04.150
Thank you.

00:15:04.150 --> 00:15:06.150
(Applause)

00:15:06.150 --> 00:15:08.150
Chris Anderson: Question for you, Kwabena.

00:15:08.150 --> 00:15:12.150
Do you put together in your mind the work you're doing,

00:15:12.150 --> 00:15:15.150
the future of Africa, this conference --

00:15:15.150 --> 00:15:18.150
what connections can we make, if any, between them?

00:15:18.150 --> 00:15:20.150
Kwabena Boahen: Yes, like I said at the beginning,

00:15:20.150 --> 00:15:24.150
I got my first computer when I was a teenager, growing up in Accra.

00:15:24.150 --> 00:15:28.150
And I had this gut reaction that this was the wrong way to do it.

00:15:28.150 --> 00:15:31.150
It was very brute force; it was very inelegant.

00:15:31.150 --> 00:15:33.150
I don't think that I would've had that reaction,

00:15:33.150 --> 00:15:36.150
if I'd grown up reading all this science fiction,

00:15:36.150 --> 00:15:40.150
hearing about RD2D2, whatever it was called, and just -- you know,

00:15:40.150 --> 00:15:41.150
buying into this hype about computers.

00:15:41.150 --> 00:15:43.150
I was coming at it from a different perspective,

00:15:43.150 --> 00:15:45.150
where I was bringing that different perspective

00:15:45.150 --> 00:15:47.150
to bear on the problem.

00:15:47.150 --> 00:15:50.150
And I think a lot of people in Africa have this different perspective,

00:15:50.150 --> 00:15:52.150
and I think that's going to impact technology.

00:15:52.150 --> 00:15:54.150
And that's going to impact how it's going to evolve.

00:15:54.150 --> 00:15:56.150
And I think you're going to be able to see, use that infusion,

00:15:56.150 --> 00:15:58.150
to come up with new things,

00:15:58.150 --> 00:16:01.150
because you're coming from a different perspective.

00:16:01.150 --> 00:16:05.150
I think we can contribute. We can dream like everybody else.

00:16:05.150 --> 00:16:07.150
CA: Thanks Kwabena, that was really interesting.

00:16:07.150 --> 00:16:08.150
Thank you.

00:16:08.150 --> 00:16:10.150
(Applause)
