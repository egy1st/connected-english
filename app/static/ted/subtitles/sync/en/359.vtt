WEBVTT

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:19.150
Aside from keeping the rain out and producing some usable space,

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:23.150
architecture is nothing but a special-effects machine

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:26.150
that delights and disturbs the senses.

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:31.150
Our work is across media. The work comes in all shapes and sizes.

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:35.150
It's small and large. This is an ashtray, a water glass.

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:38.150
From urban planning and master planning

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:42.150
to theater and all sorts of stuff.

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:44.150
The thing that all the work has in common

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:49.150
is that it challenges the assumptions about conventions of space.

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:51.150
And these are everyday conventions,

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:56.150
conventions that are so obvious that we are blinded by their familiarity.

00:00:56.150 --> 00:01:00.150
And I've assembled a sampling of work

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:04.150
that all share a kind of productive nihilism

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:08.150
that's used in the service of creating a particular special effect.

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:13.150
And that is something like nothing, or something next to nothing.

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:19.150
It's done through a form of subtraction or obstruction or interference

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:23.150
in a world that we naturally sleepwalk through.

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:26.150
This is an image that won us a competition

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:30.150
for an exhibition pavilion for the Swiss Expo 2002

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.150
on Lake Neuchatel, near Geneva.

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:35.150
And we wanted to use the water not only as a context,

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:37.150
but as a primary building material.

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:40.150
We wanted to make an architecture of atmosphere.

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:43.150
So, no walls, no roof, no purpose --

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:46.150
just a mass of atomized water, a big cloud.

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:49.150
And this proposal was a reaction to the over-saturation

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:54.150
of emergent technologies in recent national and world expositions,

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:59.150
which feeds, or has been feeding, our insatiable appetite

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:05.150
for visual stimulation with an ever greater digital virtuosity.

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:09.150
High definition, in our opinion, has become the new orthodoxy.

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:14.150
And we ask the question, can we use technology, high technology,

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:20.150
to make an expo pavilion that's decidedly low definition,

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:23.150
that also challenges the conventions of space and skin,

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:25.150
and rethinks our dependence on vision?

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:28.150
So this is how we sought to do it.

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:30.150
Water's pumped from the lake and is filtered

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:35.150
and shot as a fine mist through an array of high-pressure fog nozzles,

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:39.150
35,000 of them. And a weather station is on the structure.

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:42.150
It reads the shifting conditions of temperature, humidity,

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:45.150
wind direction, wind speed, dew point,

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:48.150
and it processes this data in a central computer

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:51.150
that calibrates the degree of water pressure

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:53.150
and distribution of water throughout.

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:58.150
And it's a responsive system that's trained on actual weather.

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:02.150
So, this is just in construction, and there's a tensegrity structure.

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:05.150
It's about 300 feet wide, the size of a football field,

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:09.150
and it sits on just four very delicate columns.

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:12.150
These are the fog nozzles, the interface,

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:16.150
and basically the system is kind of reading the real weather,

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:20.150
and producing kind of semi-artificial and real weather.

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:24.150
So, we're very interested in creating weather. I don't know why.

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:27.150
Now, here we go, one side, the outside

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:29.150
and then from the inside of the space

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:31.150
you can see what the quality of the space was.

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:34.150
Unlike entering any normal space,

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:38.150
entering Blur is like stepping into a habitable medium.

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:43.150
It's formless, featureless, depthless, scaleless, massless,

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:45.150
purposeless and dimensionless.

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:48.150
All references are erased,

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:54.150
leaving only an optical whiteout and white noise of the pulsing nozzles.

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:57.150
So, this is an exhibition pavilion

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:00.150
where there is absolutely nothing to see and nothing to do.

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:07.150
And we pride ourselves -- it's a spectacular anti-spectacle

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:11.150
in which all the conventions of spectacle are turned on their head.

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:13.150
So, the audience is dispersed,

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:16.150
focused attention and dramatic build-up and climax

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:19.150
are all replaced by a kind of attenuated attention

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:23.150
that's sustained by a sense of apprehension caused by the fog.

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:29.150
And this is very much like how the Victorian novel used fog in this way.

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:32.150
So here the world is put out of focus,

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:35.150
while our visual dependence is put into focus.

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:39.150
The public, you know, once disoriented

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:43.150
can actually ascend to the angel deck above

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:46.150
and then just come down under those lips into the water bar.

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:48.150
So, all the waters of the world are served there,

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:52.150
so we thought that, you know, after being at the water

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:55.150
and moving through the water and breathing the water,

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:58.150
you could also drink this building.

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:02.150
And so it is sort of a theme,

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:05.150
but it goes a little bit, you know, deeper than that.

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:07.150
We really wanted to bring out

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:11.150
our absolute dependence on this master sense,

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:15.150
and maybe share our kind of sensibility with our other senses.

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:19.150
You know, when we did this project it was a kind of tough sell,

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:21.150
because the Swiss said, "Well, why are we going to spend, you know,

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:25.150
10 million dollars producing an effect

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:27.150
that we already have in natural abundance that we hate?"

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:32.150
And, you know, we thought -- well, we tried to convince them.

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:38.150
And in the end, you know, they adapted this as a national icon

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:43.150
that came to represent Swiss doubt, which we -- you know,

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:45.150
it was kind of a meaning machine

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:47.150
that everybody kind of laid on their own meanings off of.

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:50.150
Anyway, it's a temporary structure that was ultimately destroyed,

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:54.150
and so it's now a memory of an apparition, actually,

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:57.150
but it continues to live in edible form.

00:05:57.150 --> 00:05:59.150
And this is the highest honor

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:04.150
to be bestowed upon an architect in Switzerland -- to have a chocolate bar.

00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:06.150
Anyway, moving along.

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:11.150
So in the '80s and '90s, we were mostly known for independent work,

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:15.150
such as installation artist, architect,

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:20.150
commissioned projects by museums and non-for-profit organizations.

00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:23.150
And we did a lot of media work,

00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:25.150
also a lot of experimental theater projects.

00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:30.150
In 2003, the Whitney mounted a retrospective of our work

00:06:30.150 --> 00:06:33.150
that featured a lot of this work from the '80s and '90s.

00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:40.150
However, the work itself resisted the very nature of a retrospective,

00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:43.150
and this is just some of the stuff that was in the show.

00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:46.150
This was a piece on tourism in the United States.

00:06:46.150 --> 00:06:49.150
This is "Soft Sell" for 42nd Street.

00:06:49.150 --> 00:06:52.150
This was something done at the Cartier Foundation.

00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:57.150
"Master/Slave" at the MOMA, the project series, a piece called "Parasite."

00:06:57.150 --> 00:07:00.150
And so there were many, many of these kinds of projects.

00:07:00.150 --> 00:07:06.150
Anyway, they gave us the whole fourth floor, and, you know,

00:07:06.150 --> 00:07:08.150
the problem of the retrospective

00:07:08.150 --> 00:07:10.150
was something we were very uncomfortable with.

00:07:10.150 --> 00:07:12.150
It's a kind of invention of the museum

00:07:12.150 --> 00:07:16.150
that's supposed to bring a kind of cohesive understanding

00:07:16.150 --> 00:07:18.150
to the public of a body of work.

00:07:18.150 --> 00:07:23.150
And our work doesn't really resolve itself into a body in any way at all.

00:07:23.150 --> 00:07:28.150
And one of the recurring themes, by the way, that in the work

00:07:28.150 --> 00:07:31.150
was a kind of hostility toward the museum itself,

00:07:31.150 --> 00:07:36.150
and asking about the conventions of the museum, like the wall, the white wall.

00:07:36.150 --> 00:07:38.150
So, what you see here

00:07:38.150 --> 00:07:41.150
is basically a plan of many installations that were put there.

00:07:41.150 --> 00:07:44.150
And we actually had to install white walls

00:07:44.150 --> 00:07:46.150
to separate these pieces, which didn't belong together.

00:07:46.150 --> 00:07:51.150
But these white walls became a kind of target and weapon at the same time.

00:07:51.150 --> 00:07:54.150
We used the wall to partition the 13 installations of the project

00:07:54.150 --> 00:07:58.150
and produce a kind of acoustic and visual separation.

00:07:59.150 --> 00:08:01.150
And what you see is -- actually,

00:08:01.150 --> 00:08:06.150
the red dotted line shows the track of this performing element,

00:08:06.150 --> 00:08:09.150
which was a new piece that created -- that we created for the --

00:08:09.150 --> 00:08:13.150
which was a robotic drill, basically, that went all the way around,

00:08:13.150 --> 00:08:18.150
cruised the museum, went all around the walls and did a lot of damage.

00:08:19.150 --> 00:08:22.150
So, the drill was mounted on this robotic arm.

00:08:22.150 --> 00:08:26.150
We worked with, by the way, Honeybee Robotics. This is the brain.

00:08:26.150 --> 00:08:29.150
Honeybee Robotics designed the Mars Driller,

00:08:29.150 --> 00:08:31.150
and it was really very much fun to work with them.

00:08:31.150 --> 00:08:35.150
They weren't doing their primary work, which was for the government,

00:08:35.150 --> 00:08:38.150
while they were helping us with this.

00:08:38.150 --> 00:08:40.150
In any case, the way it works is that

00:08:40.150 --> 00:08:46.150
an intelligent navigator basically maps the entire surface of these walls.

00:08:46.150 --> 00:08:49.150
So, unfolded it's about 300 linear feet.

00:08:49.150 --> 00:08:53.150
And it randomly generates points within a three-dimensional matrix.

00:08:53.150 --> 00:08:58.150
It selects a point, it guides the drill to that point, it pierces the dry wall,

00:08:58.150 --> 00:09:02.150
leaving a half-inch hole before traveling to the next location.

00:09:03.150 --> 00:09:07.150
Initially these holes were lone blemishes,

00:09:07.150 --> 00:09:09.150
and as the exhibition continued

00:09:09.150 --> 00:09:12.150
the walls became increasingly perforated.

00:09:12.150 --> 00:09:15.150
So eventually holes on both sides of the wall aligned,

00:09:15.150 --> 00:09:17.150
opening views from gallery to gallery.

00:09:17.150 --> 00:09:21.150
Clusters of holes randomly opened up sections of wall.

00:09:21.150 --> 00:09:24.150
And so this was a three-month performance piece

00:09:24.150 --> 00:09:30.150
in which the wall was made into kind of an increasingly unstable element.

00:09:31.150 --> 00:09:34.150
And also the acoustic separation was destroyed.

00:09:35.150 --> 00:09:37.150
Also the visual separation.

00:09:37.150 --> 00:09:43.150
And there was also this constant background groan, which was very annoying.

00:09:43.150 --> 00:09:45.150
And this is one of the blackout spaces

00:09:45.150 --> 00:09:48.150
where there's a video piece that became totally not useful.

00:09:48.150 --> 00:09:52.150
So rather than securing a neutral background for the artworks on display,

00:09:52.150 --> 00:09:55.150
the wall now actively competed for attention.

00:09:56.150 --> 00:10:00.150
And this acoustical nuisance and visual nuisance

00:10:00.150 --> 00:10:03.150
basically exposed the discomfort of the work

00:10:03.150 --> 00:10:08.150
to this encompassing nature of the retrospective.

00:10:09.150 --> 00:10:13.150
It was really great when it started to break up all of the curatorial text.

00:10:13.150 --> 00:10:17.150
Moving along to a project that we finished about a year ago.

00:10:17.150 --> 00:10:22.150
It's the ICA -- the Institute of Contemporary Art -- in Boston,

00:10:22.150 --> 00:10:24.150
which is on the waterfront.

00:10:24.150 --> 00:10:27.150
And there's not enough time to really introduce the building,

00:10:27.150 --> 00:10:29.150
but I'll simply say that the building negotiates

00:10:29.150 --> 00:10:35.150
between this outwardly focused nature of the site --

00:10:35.150 --> 00:10:38.150
you know, it's a really great waterfront site in Boston --

00:10:38.150 --> 00:10:43.150
and this contradictory other desire to have an inwardly focused museum.

00:10:43.150 --> 00:10:47.150
So, the nature of the building is that it looks at looking --

00:10:47.150 --> 00:10:49.150
I mean that's its primary objective,

00:10:50.150 --> 00:10:54.150
both its program and its architectural conceit.

00:10:56.150 --> 00:11:00.150
The building incorporates the site,

00:11:00.150 --> 00:11:04.150
but it dispenses it in very small doses

00:11:04.150 --> 00:11:07.150
in the way that the museum is choreographed.

00:11:07.150 --> 00:11:11.150
So, you come in and you're basically squeezed by the theater,

00:11:11.150 --> 00:11:13.150
by the belly of the theater, into this very compressed space

00:11:13.150 --> 00:11:15.150
where the view is turned off.

00:11:15.150 --> 00:11:20.150
Then you come up in this glass elevator right near the curtain wall.

00:11:20.150 --> 00:11:24.150
This elevator's about the size of a New York City studio apartment.

00:11:24.150 --> 00:11:26.150
And then, this is a view going up,

00:11:26.150 --> 00:11:28.150
and then you could come into the theater,

00:11:28.150 --> 00:11:33.150
which can actually deny the view or open it up and become a backdrop.

00:11:33.150 --> 00:11:39.150
And many musicians choose to use the theater glass walls totally open.

00:11:39.150 --> 00:11:41.150
The view is denied in the galleries

00:11:41.150 --> 00:11:44.150
where we receive just natural light,

00:11:44.150 --> 00:11:49.150
and then exposed again in the north gallery with a panoramic view.

00:11:49.150 --> 00:11:51.150
The original intention of this space,

00:11:51.150 --> 00:11:54.150
which was unfortunately never realized,

00:11:54.150 --> 00:11:56.150
was to use lenticular glass

00:11:56.150 --> 00:11:59.150
which allowed only a kind of perpendicular view out.

00:11:59.150 --> 00:12:02.150
In this very narrow space that connects east and west galleries

00:12:02.150 --> 00:12:06.150
the intention was really to not get a climax,

00:12:06.150 --> 00:12:08.150
but to have the view stalk you,

00:12:08.150 --> 00:12:12.150
so the view would open up as you walked from one end to the other.

00:12:12.150 --> 00:12:15.150
This was eliminated because the view was too good,

00:12:15.150 --> 00:12:18.150
and the mayor said, "No, we just want this open."

00:12:18.150 --> 00:12:20.150
The architect lost here.

00:12:20.150 --> 00:12:23.150
But culminating -- and that's where this hooks into the theme of my little talk --

00:12:23.150 --> 00:12:25.150
is this Mediatheque,

00:12:25.150 --> 00:12:29.150
which is suspended from the cantilevered portion of the building.

00:12:29.150 --> 00:12:32.150
So this is an 80-foot cantilever -- it's quite substantial.

00:12:32.150 --> 00:12:36.150
So, it's already sticking out into space enough,

00:12:36.150 --> 00:12:41.150
and then from that is this, is this small area called the Mediatheque.

00:12:41.150 --> 00:12:45.150
The Mediatheque has something like 16 stations

00:12:45.150 --> 00:12:47.150
where the public can get onto the server

00:12:47.150 --> 00:12:51.150
and look at digital artworks or also curated artworks off the web.

00:12:51.150 --> 00:12:58.150
And this was really a kind of very important part of this building,

00:12:58.150 --> 00:13:00.150
and here is a point where architecture --

00:13:00.150 --> 00:13:04.150
this is like technology-free -- architecture is only a framing device,

00:13:04.150 --> 00:13:07.150
it only edits the harbor view, the industrial harbor

00:13:08.150 --> 00:13:12.150
just through its walls, its floors and its ceiling,

00:13:12.150 --> 00:13:18.150
to only expose the water itself, the texture of water,

00:13:18.150 --> 00:13:22.150
much like a hypnotic effect created by electronic snow

00:13:22.150 --> 00:13:25.150
or a lava lamp or something like that.

00:13:25.150 --> 00:13:29.150
And here is where we really felt that there was a great convergence

00:13:29.150 --> 00:13:33.150
of the technological and the natural in the project.

00:13:34.150 --> 00:13:40.150
But there is just no information, it's just -- it's just hypnosis.

00:13:41.150 --> 00:13:43.150
Moving along to Lincoln Center.

00:13:44.150 --> 00:13:48.150
These are the guys that did the project in the first place, 50 years ago.

00:13:48.150 --> 00:13:51.150
We're taking over now, doing work that ranges in scale

00:13:51.150 --> 00:13:57.150
from small-scale repairs to major renovations and major facility expansions.

00:13:57.150 --> 00:14:00.150
But we're doing it with a lot less testosterone.

00:14:00.150 --> 00:14:05.150
This is the extent of the work that's to be completed by 2010.

00:14:05.150 --> 00:14:07.150
And for the purposes of this talk,

00:14:07.150 --> 00:14:11.150
I wanted to isolate just a part of a project that's even a part of a project

00:14:11.150 --> 00:14:15.150
that touches a little bit on this theme of architectural special effects,

00:14:15.150 --> 00:14:19.150
and it happens to be our current obsession,

00:14:19.150 --> 00:14:25.150
and it plays a little bit with the purging and adding of distraction.

00:14:25.150 --> 00:14:29.150
It's Alice Tully Hall, and it's tucked under the Juilliard Building

00:14:29.150 --> 00:14:33.150
and descends several levels under the street.

00:14:33.150 --> 00:14:37.150
So, this is the entrance to Tully Hall as it used to be,

00:14:37.150 --> 00:14:39.150
before the renovation, which we just started.

00:14:39.150 --> 00:14:42.150
And we asked ourselves, why couldn't it be exhibitionistic,

00:14:42.150 --> 00:14:45.150
like the Met, or like some of the other buildings at Lincoln Center?

00:14:45.150 --> 00:14:48.150
And one of the things that we were asked to do

00:14:48.150 --> 00:14:53.150
was give it a street identity, expand the lobbies and make it visually accessible.

00:14:53.150 --> 00:14:57.150
And this building, which is just naturally hermetic, we stripped.

00:14:57.150 --> 00:15:00.150
We basically did a striptease, architectural striptease,

00:15:00.150 --> 00:15:05.150
where we're framing with this kind of canopy --

00:15:05.150 --> 00:15:08.150
the underside of three levels of expansion of Juilliard,

00:15:08.150 --> 00:15:13.150
about 45,000 square feet -- cutting it to the angle of Broadway,

00:15:13.150 --> 00:15:18.150
and then exposing, using that canopy to frame Tully Hall.

00:15:18.150 --> 00:15:21.150
Before and after shot. (Applause)

00:15:22.150 --> 00:15:26.150
Wait a minute, it's just in that state, we have a long way to go.

00:15:26.150 --> 00:15:29.150
But what I wanted to do was take a couple of seconds that I have left

00:15:29.150 --> 00:15:31.150
to just talk about the hall itself,

00:15:31.150 --> 00:15:35.150
which is kind of where we're really doing a massive amount of work.

00:15:35.150 --> 00:15:38.150
So, the hall is a multi-purpose hall.

00:15:38.150 --> 00:15:43.150
The clients have asked us to produce a great chamber music hall.

00:15:43.150 --> 00:15:47.150
Now, that's really tough to do with a hall that has 1,100 seats.

00:15:47.150 --> 00:15:50.150
Chamber and the notion of chamber has to do with salons

00:15:50.150 --> 00:15:53.150
and small-scale performances. They asked us to bring an intimacy.

00:15:53.150 --> 00:15:56.150
How do you bring an intimacy into a hall?

00:15:56.150 --> 00:15:58.150
Intimacy for us means a lot of different things.

00:15:58.150 --> 00:16:02.150
It means acoustic intimacy and it means visual intimacy.

00:16:02.150 --> 00:16:06.150
One thing is that the subway is running and rumbling right under the hall.

00:16:06.150 --> 00:16:08.150
Another thing that could be fixed is the shape of the hall.

00:16:08.150 --> 00:16:11.150
It's like a coffin, it basically sends all the sound,

00:16:11.150 --> 00:16:13.150
like a gutter-ball effect, down the aisles.

00:16:13.150 --> 00:16:16.150
The walls are made of absorptive surface,

00:16:16.150 --> 00:16:18.150
half absorptive, half reflective,

00:16:18.150 --> 00:16:21.150
which is not very good for concert sound.

00:16:21.150 --> 00:16:25.150
This is Avery Fisher Hall, but the notion of junk -- visual junk --

00:16:25.150 --> 00:16:29.150
was very, very important to us, to get rid of visual noise.

00:16:29.150 --> 00:16:31.150
Because we can't eliminate a single seat,

00:16:31.150 --> 00:16:34.150
the architecture is restricted to 18 inches.

00:16:34.150 --> 00:16:37.150
So it's a very, very thin architecture.

00:16:37.150 --> 00:16:41.150
First we do a kind of partial box and box separation,

00:16:41.150 --> 00:16:43.150
to take away the distraction of the subway noise.

00:16:43.150 --> 00:16:48.150
Next we wrap the entire hall -- almost like this Olivetti keyboard --

00:16:48.150 --> 00:16:51.150
with a material, with a wood material

00:16:51.150 --> 00:16:53.150
that basically covers all the surfaces:

00:16:53.150 --> 00:16:57.150
wall, ceiling, floor, stage, steps, everything, boxes.

00:16:57.150 --> 00:17:01.150
But it's acoustically engineered to focus the sound into the house

00:17:01.150 --> 00:17:04.150
and back to the stage. And here's an acoustic shelf.

00:17:04.150 --> 00:17:07.150
Looking up the hall. Just a section of the stage.

00:17:07.150 --> 00:17:10.150
Just everything is lined, it incorporates --

00:17:10.150 --> 00:17:12.150
every single thing that you could possibly imagine

00:17:12.150 --> 00:17:14.150
is tucked into this high-performance skin.

00:17:14.150 --> 00:17:16.150
But one more added feature.

00:17:16.150 --> 00:17:19.150
So now that we've stripped the hall of all visual distraction,

00:17:19.150 --> 00:17:22.150
everything that prevents this intimacy

00:17:22.150 --> 00:17:25.150
which is supposed to connect the house, the audience,

00:17:25.150 --> 00:17:29.150
with the performers, we add one little detail,

00:17:29.150 --> 00:17:33.150
one piece of architectural excess, a special effect: lighting.

00:17:33.150 --> 00:17:37.150
We very strongly believe that the theatrics of a concert hall

00:17:37.150 --> 00:17:41.150
is as much in the space of intermission and the space of arrival

00:17:41.150 --> 00:17:43.150
as it is when the concert starts.

00:17:43.150 --> 00:17:47.150
So what we wanted to do was produce this effect,

00:17:47.150 --> 00:17:49.150
this lighting effect,

00:17:49.150 --> 00:17:53.150
which made us have to bioengineer the wood walls.

00:17:53.150 --> 00:17:59.150
And what it entails is the use of resin, of this very thick resin

00:17:59.150 --> 00:18:03.150
with a veneer of the same kind of wood that's used throughout the hall,

00:18:03.150 --> 00:18:07.150
in a kind of seamless continuity

00:18:07.150 --> 00:18:12.150
that wraps the hall in light, like a belt of light: rather than separating,

00:18:12.150 --> 00:18:16.150
like a proscenium would separate the audience from performers,

00:18:16.150 --> 00:18:18.150
it connects audience with players.

00:18:18.150 --> 00:18:24.150
And this is a mockup that is in Salt Lake City

00:18:24.150 --> 00:18:29.150
that gives you a sense of what this is going to look like in full-scale.

00:18:29.150 --> 00:18:32.150
And this is a guy from Salt Lake City,

00:18:32.150 --> 00:18:34.150
this is what they look like out there.

00:18:34.150 --> 00:18:37.150
(Laughter)

00:18:37.150 --> 00:18:40.150
And for us, I mean it's really kind of a very strange thing,

00:18:40.150 --> 00:18:46.150
but the moments in the hall that the buzz kind of dies down

00:18:46.150 --> 00:18:49.150
when the audience is waiting for the performance to begin,

00:18:49.150 --> 00:18:53.150
very similar to the parting of curtains or the raising of a chandelier,

00:18:53.150 --> 00:18:59.150
the walls will just exude this glow, temporarily stealing attention from the stage.

00:18:59.150 --> 00:19:03.150
And this is Tully in construction now.

00:19:03.150 --> 00:19:07.150
I have no ending to say, except that I'm a couple of minutes over.

00:19:07.150 --> 00:19:09.150
Thank you very much.

00:19:09.150 --> 00:19:11.150
(Applause)
