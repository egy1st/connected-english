00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.150
When I first arrived in beautiful Zimbabwe,

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:20.150
it was difficult to understand that 35 percent of the population

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:22.150
is HIV positive.

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:27.150
It really wasn't until I was invited to the homes of people

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:32.150
that I started to understand the human toll of the epidemic.

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:36.150
For instance, this is Herbert with his grandmother.

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:40.150
When I first met him, he was sitting on his grandmother's lap.

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:43.150
He has been orphaned, as both of his parents died of AIDS,

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:47.150
and his grandmother took care of him until he too died of AIDS.

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:49.150
He liked to sit on her lap

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:54.150
because he said that it was painful for him to lie in his own bed.

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:58.150
When she got up to make tea, she placed him in my own lap

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:04.150
and I had never felt a child that was that emaciated.

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:09.150
Before I left, I actually asked him if I could get him something.

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.150
I thought he would ask for a toy, or candy,

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:14.150
and he asked me for slippers,

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:17.150
because he said that his feet were cold.

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:20.150
This is Joyce who's -- in this picture -- 21.

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:23.150
Single mother, HIV positive.

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:25.150
I photographed her before and after

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:28.150
the birth of her beautiful baby girl, Issa.

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:31.150
And I was last week walking on Lafayette Street in Manhattan

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:34.150
and got a call from a woman who I didn't know,

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:37.150
but she called to tell me that Joyce had passed away

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:39.150
at the age of 23.

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:42.150
Joyce's mother is now taking care of her daughter,

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.150
like so many other Zimbabwean children

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:46.150
who've been orphaned by the epidemic.

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:48.150
So a few of the stories.

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:50.150
With every picture,

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:55.150
there are individuals who have full lives

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:57.150
and stories that deserve to be told.

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:00.150
All these pictures are from Zimbabwe.

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:44.150
Chris Anderson: Kirsten, will you just take one minute,

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:49.150
just to tell your own story of how you got to Africa?

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:50.150
Kirsten Ashburn: Mmm, gosh.

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:51.150
CA: Just --

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:55.150
KA: Actually, I was working at the time, doing production

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:57.150
for a fashion photographer.

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:00.150
And I was constantly reading the New York Times,

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:04.150
and stunned by the statistics, the numbers.

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:06.150
It was just frightening.

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:08.150
So I quit my job

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:11.150
and decided that that's the subject that I wanted to tackle.

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:16.150
And I first actually went to Botswana, where I spent a month --

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:18.150
this is in December 2000 --

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:21.150
then went to Zimbabwe for a month and a half,

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:24.150
and then went back again this March 2002

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:27.150
for another month and a half in Zimbabwe.

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:29.150
CA: That's an amazing story, thank you.

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:31.150
KB: Thanks for letting me show these.
