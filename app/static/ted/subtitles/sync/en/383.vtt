00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:18.150
This means, "I'm smiling."

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.150
So does that.

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.150
This means "mouse."

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:25.150
"Cat."

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:28.150
Here we have a story.

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:31.150
The start of the story, where this means guy,

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:36.150
and that is a ponytail on a passer-by.

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:41.150
Here's where it happens.

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:43.150
These are when.

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:46.150
This is a cassette tape the girl puts into her cassette-tape player.

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:48.150
She wears it every day.

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:49.150
It's not considered vintage --

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:51.150
she just likes certain music to sound a certain way.

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:53.150
Look at her posture; it's remarkable.

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:55.150
That's because she dances.

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:57.150
Now he, the guy, takes all of this in, figuring,

00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:01.150
"Honestly, geez, what are my chances?"

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:02.150
(Laughter)

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:05.150
And he could say, "Oh my God!"

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:07.150
or "I heart you!"

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:09.150
"I'm laughing out loud."

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.150
"I want to give you a hug."

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:13.150
But he comes up with that, you know.

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:17.150
He tells her, "I'd like to hand-paint your portrait on a coffee mug."

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:19.150
(Laughter)

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:21.150
Put a crab inside it.

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.150
Add some water.

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:25.150
Seven different salts.

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:28.150
He means he's got this sudden notion to stand on dry land,

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:30.150
but just panhandle at the ocean.

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:36.150
He says, "You look like a mermaid, but you walk like a waltz."

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:40.150
And the girl goes, "Wha'?"

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:43.150
So, the guy replies, "Yeah, I know, I know.

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:46.150
I think my heartbeat might be the Morse code for inappropriate.

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:48.150
At least, that's how it seems.

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:52.150
I'm like a junior varsity cheerleader sometimes --

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:57.150
for swearing, awkward silences, and very simple rhyme schemes.

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:02.150
Right now, talking to you, I'm not even really a guy.

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:04.150
I'm a monkey --

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:05.150
(Laughter) --

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:07.150
blowing kisses

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:09.150
at a butterfly.

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:12.150
But I'm still suggesting you and I should meet.

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:17.150
First, soon, and then a lot.

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:21.150
I'm thinking the southwest corner of 5th and 42nd at noon tomorrow,

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:25.150
but I'll stay until you show up, ponytail or not.

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:27.150
Hell, ponytail alone.

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:29.150
I don't know what else to tell you.

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:31.150
I got a pencil you can borrow.

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:34.150
You can put it in your phone."

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:42.150
But the girl does not budge, does not smile, does not frown.

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:46.150
She just says, "No thank you."

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:48.150
You know?

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:56.150
[ "i don't need 2 write it down." ]

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:06.150
(Applause)
