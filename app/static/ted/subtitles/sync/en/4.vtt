WEBVTT

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:17.150
I want to start off by saying, Houston, we have a problem.

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:21.150
We're entering a second generation of no progress

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:26.150
in terms of human flight in space. In fact, we've regressed.

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:32.150
We stand a very big chance of losing our ability to inspire our youth

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:35.150
to go out and continue this very important thing

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:37.150
that we as a species have always done.

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:40.150
And that is, instinctively we've gone out

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:46.150
and climbed over difficult places, went to more hostile places,

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:52.150
and found out later, maybe to our surprise, that that's the reason we survived.

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:54.150
And I feel very strongly

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:58.150
that it's not good enough for us to have generations of kids

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:02.150
that think that it's OK to look forward to a better version

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:05.150
of a cell phone with a video in it.

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:09.150
They need to look forward to exploration; they need to look forward to colonization;

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:13.150
they need to look forward to breakthroughs.

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:17.150
We need to inspire them, because they need to lead us

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:20.150
and help us survive in the future.

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:26.150
I'm particularly troubled that what NASA's doing right now with this new Bush doctrine

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:32.150
to -- for this next decade and a half -- oh shoot, I screwed up.

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:37.150
We have real specific instructions here not to talk about politics.

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:38.150
(Laughter)

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:41.150
What we're looking forward to is --

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:42.150
(Applause)

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:45.150
what we're looking forward to

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:48.150
is not only the inspiration of our children,

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:53.150
but the current plan right now is not really even allowing

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:57.150
the most creative people in this country -- the Boeing's and Lockheed's

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:03.150
space engineers -- to go out and take risks and try new stuff.

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:09.150
We're going to go back to the moon ... 50 years later?

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:15.150
And we're going to do it very specifically planned to not learn anything new.

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:19.150
I'm really troubled by that. But anyway that's --

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:23.150
the basis of the thing that I want to share with you today, though,

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:27.150
is that right back to where we inspire people

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:29.150
who will be our great leaders later.

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:33.150
That's the theme of my next 15 minutes here.

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:37.150
And I think that the inspiration begins when you're very young:

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:41.150
three-year-olds, up to 12-, 14-year-olds.

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:45.150
What they look at is the most important thing.

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:48.150
Let's take a snapshot at aviation.

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:51.150
And there was a wonderful little short four-year time period

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:54.150
when marvelous things happened.

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:58.150
It started in 1908, when the Wright brothers flew in Paris, and everybody said,

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:02.150
"Ooh, hey, I can do that." There's only a few people that have flown

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:07.150
in early 1908. In four years, 39 countries had hundreds of airplanes,

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:11.150
thousand of pilots. Airplanes were invented by natural selection.

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:15.150
Now you can say that intelligent design designs our airplanes of today,

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:19.150
but there was no intelligent design really designing those early airplanes.

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:24.150
There were probably at least 30,000 different things tried,

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:28.150
and when they crash and kill the pilot, don't try that again.

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:31.150
The ones that flew and landed OK

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:32.150
because there were no trained pilots

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:36.150
who had good flying qualities by definition.

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:41.150
So we, by making a whole bunch of attempts, thousands of attempts,

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:44.150
in that four-year time period, we invented the concepts

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:47.150
of the airplanes that we fly today. And that's why they're so safe,

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:51.150
as we gave it a lot of chance to find what's good.

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:53.150
That has not happened at all in space flying.

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:57.150
There's only been two concepts tried -- two by the U.S. and one by the Russians.

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:59.150
Well, who was inspired during that time period?

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:02.150
Aviation Week asked me to make a list of who I thought

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:05.150
were the movers and shakers of the first 100 years of aviation.

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:09.150
And I wrote them down and I found out later that every one of them

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:16.150
was a little kid in that wonderful renaissance of aviation.

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:20.150
Well, what happened when I was a little kid was -- some pretty heavy stuff too.

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:25.150
The jet age started: the missile age started. Von Braun was on there

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:27.150
showing how to go to Mars -- and this was before Sputnik.

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:31.150
And this was at a time when Mars was a hell of a lot more interesting

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:33.150
than it is now. We thought there'd be animals there;

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:37.150
we knew there were plants there; the colors change, right?

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:40.150
But, you know, NASA screwed that up because they've sent these robots

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:43.150
and they've landed it only in the deserts.

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:47.150
(Laughter)

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:54.150
If you look at what happened -- this little black line is as fast as man ever flew,

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:57.150
and the red line is top-of-the-line military fighters

00:04:57.150 --> 00:05:00.150
and the blue line is commercial air transport.

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:02.150
You notice here's a big jump when I was a little kid --

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:06.150
and I think that had something to do with giving me the courage

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:11.150
to go out and try something that other people weren't having the courage to try.

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:13.150
Well, what did I do when I was a kid?

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:16.150
I didn't do the hotrods and the girls and the dancing

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:21.150
and, well, we didn't have drugs in those days. But I did competition model airplanes.

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:23.150
I spent about seven years during the Vietnam War

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:26.150
flight-testing airplanes for the Air Force.

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:28.150
And then I went in and I had a lot of fun building airplanes

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:31.150
that people could build in their garages.

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:34.150
And some 3,000 of those are flying. Of course, one of them

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:38.150
is around the world Voyager. I founded another company in '82,

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:40.150
which is my company now.

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:47.150
And we have developed more than one new type of airplane every year since 1982.

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:51.150
And there's a lot of them that I actually can't show you on this chart.

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:55.150
The most impressive airplane ever, I believe, was designed

00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:59.150
only a dozen years after the first operational jet.

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:03.150
Stayed in service till it was too rusty to fly, taken out of service.

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:10.150
We retreated in '98 back to something that was developed in '56. What?

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:13.150
The most impressive spaceship ever, I believe,

00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:18.150
was a Grumman Lunar Lander. It was a -- you know, it landed on the moon,

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:20.150
take off of the moon, didn't need any maintenance guys --

00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:22.150
that's kind of cool.

00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:25.150
We've lost that capability. We abandoned it in '72.

00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:30.150
This thing was designed three years after Gagarin first flew in space in 1961.

00:06:30.150 --> 00:06:35.150
Three years, and we can't do that now. Crazy.

00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:40.150
Talk very briefly about innovation cycles, things that grow,

00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:44.150
have a lot of activity; they die out when they're replaced by something else.

00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:47.150
These things tend to happen every 25 years.

00:06:47.150 --> 00:06:51.150
40 years long, with an overlap. You can put that statement

00:06:51.150 --> 00:06:54.150
on all kinds of different technologies. The interesting thing --

00:06:54.150 --> 00:06:57.150
by the way, the speed here, excuse me, higher-speed travel

00:06:57.150 --> 00:07:03.150
is the title of these innovation cycles. There is none here.

00:07:03.150 --> 00:07:11.150
These two new airplanes are the same speed as the DC8 that was done in 1958.

00:07:11.150 --> 00:07:14.150
Here's the biggie, and that is, you don't have innovation cycles

00:07:14.150 --> 00:07:17.150
if the government develops and the government uses it.

00:07:17.150 --> 00:07:21.150
You know, a good example, of course, is the DARPA net.

00:07:21.150 --> 00:07:24.150
Computers were used for artillery first, then IRS.

00:07:24.150 --> 00:07:27.150
But when we got it, now you have all the level of activity,

00:07:27.150 --> 00:07:31.150
all the benefit from it. Private sector has to do it.

00:07:31.150 --> 00:07:34.150
Keep that in mind. I put down innovation --

00:07:34.150 --> 00:07:37.150
I've looked for innovation cycles in space; I found none.

00:07:37.150 --> 00:07:41.150
The very first year, starting when Gagarin went in space,

00:07:41.150 --> 00:07:44.150
and a few weeks later Alan Shepherd, there were five manned

00:07:44.150 --> 00:07:47.150
space flights in the world -- the very first year.

00:07:47.150 --> 00:07:56.150
In 2003, everyone that the United States sent to space was killed.

00:07:56.150 --> 00:07:58.150
There were only three or four flights in 2003.

00:07:58.150 --> 00:08:05.150
In 2004, there were only two flights: two Russian Soyuz flights

00:08:05.150 --> 00:08:09.150
to the international manned station. And I had to fly three in Mojave

00:08:09.150 --> 00:08:11.150
with my little group of a couple dozen people

00:08:11.150 --> 00:08:13.150
in order to get to a total of five,

00:08:13.150 --> 00:08:18.150
which was the number the same year back in 1961.

00:08:18.150 --> 00:08:23.150
There is no growth. There's no activity. There's no nothing.

00:08:23.150 --> 00:08:26.150
This is a picture here taken from SpaceShipOne.

00:08:26.150 --> 00:08:28.150
This is a picture here taken from orbit.

00:08:28.150 --> 00:08:34.150
Our goal is to make it so that you can see this picture and really enjoy that.

00:08:34.150 --> 00:08:38.150
We know how to do it for sub-orbital flying now, do it safe enough --

00:08:38.150 --> 00:08:42.150
at least as safe as the early airlines -- so that can be done.

00:08:42.150 --> 00:08:47.150
And I think I want to talk a little bit about why we had the courage

00:08:47.150 --> 00:08:54.150
to go out and try that as a small company.

00:08:54.150 --> 00:08:57.150
Well, first of all, what's going to happen next?

00:08:57.150 --> 00:09:01.150
The first industry will be a high volume, a lot of players.

00:09:01.150 --> 00:09:04.150
There's another one announced just last week.

00:09:04.150 --> 00:09:10.150
And it will be sub-orbital. And the reason it has to be sub-orbital

00:09:10.150 --> 00:09:13.150
is, there is not solutions for adequate safety

00:09:13.150 --> 00:09:18.150
to fly the public to orbit. The governments have been doing this --

00:09:18.150 --> 00:09:20.150
three governments have been doing this for 45 years,

00:09:20.150 --> 00:09:24.150
and still four percent of the people that have left the atmosphere have died.

00:09:24.150 --> 00:09:29.150
That's -- You don't want to run a business with that kind of a safety record.

00:09:29.150 --> 00:09:35.150
It'll be very high volume; we think 100,000 people will fly by 2020.

00:09:35.150 --> 00:09:37.150
I can't tell you when this will start,

00:09:37.150 --> 00:09:40.150
because I don't want my competition to know my schedule.

00:09:40.150 --> 00:09:45.150
But I think once it does, we will find solutions,

00:09:45.150 --> 00:09:48.150
and very quickly, you'll see those resort hotels in orbit.

00:09:48.150 --> 00:09:51.150
And that real easy thing to do, which is a swing around the moon

00:09:51.150 --> 00:09:55.150
so you have this cool view. And that will be really cool.

00:09:55.150 --> 00:09:57.150
Because the moon doesn't have an atmosphere --

00:09:57.150 --> 00:10:00.150
you can do an elliptical orbit and miss it by 10 feet if you want.

00:10:00.150 --> 00:10:02.150
Oh, it's going to be so much fun.

00:10:02.150 --> 00:10:04.150
(Laughter)

00:10:04.150 --> 00:10:08.150
OK. My critics say, "Hey, Rutan's just spending

00:10:08.150 --> 00:10:13.150
a lot of these billionaires' money for joyrides for billionaires.

00:10:13.150 --> 00:10:18.150
What's this? This is not a transportation system; it's just for fun."

00:10:18.150 --> 00:10:21.150
And I used to be bothered by that, and then I got to thinking,

00:10:21.150 --> 00:10:26.150
well, wait a minute. I bought my first Apple computer in 1978

00:10:26.150 --> 00:10:32.150
and I bought it because I could say, "I got a computer at my house and you don't.

00:10:32.150 --> 00:10:37.150
'What do you use it for?' Come over. It does Frogger." OK.

00:10:37.150 --> 00:10:38.150
(Laughter)

00:10:38.150 --> 00:10:41.150
Not the bank's computer or Lockheed's computer,

00:10:41.150 --> 00:10:44.150
but the home computer was for games.

00:10:44.150 --> 00:10:48.150
For a whole decade it was for fun -- we didn't even know what it was for.

00:10:48.150 --> 00:10:52.150
But what happened, the fact that we had this big industry,

00:10:52.150 --> 00:10:56.150
big development, big improvement and capability and so on,

00:10:56.150 --> 00:11:01.150
and they get out there in enough homes -- we were ripe for a new invention.

00:11:01.150 --> 00:11:03.150
And the inventor is in this audience.

00:11:03.150 --> 00:11:07.150
Al Gore invented the Internet and because of that,

00:11:07.150 --> 00:11:10.150
something that we used for a whole year -- excuse me --

00:11:10.150 --> 00:11:16.150
a whole decade for fun, became everything -- our commerce, our research,

00:11:16.150 --> 00:11:20.150
our communication and, if we let the Google guys

00:11:20.150 --> 00:11:24.150
think for another couple weekends, we can add a dozen more things to the list. (Laughter)

00:11:24.150 --> 00:11:27.150
And it won't be very long before you won't be able to convince kids

00:11:27.150 --> 00:11:32.150
that we didn't always have computers in our homes.

00:11:32.150 --> 00:11:35.150
So fun is defendable.

00:11:35.150 --> 00:11:40.150
OK, I want to show you kind of a busy chart,

00:11:40.150 --> 00:11:43.150
but in it is my prediction with what's going to happen.

00:11:43.150 --> 00:11:47.150
And in it also brings up another point, right here.

00:11:47.150 --> 00:11:51.150
There's a group of people that have come forward --

00:11:51.150 --> 00:11:54.150
and you don't know all of them -- but the ones that have come forward

00:11:54.150 --> 00:12:01.150
were inspired as young children, this little three- to 15-year-old age,

00:12:01.150 --> 00:12:04.150
by us going to orbit and going to the moon here,

00:12:04.150 --> 00:12:06.150
right in this time period.

00:12:06.150 --> 00:12:16.150
Paul Allen, Elan Musk, Richard Branson, Jeff Bezos, the Ansari family,

00:12:16.150 --> 00:12:21.150
which is now funding the Russians' sub-orbital thing,

00:12:21.150 --> 00:12:25.150
Bob Bigelow, a private space station, and Carmack.

00:12:25.150 --> 00:12:31.150
These people are taking money and putting it in an interesting area,

00:12:31.150 --> 00:12:34.150
and I think it's a lot better than they put it in an area

00:12:34.150 --> 00:12:38.150
of a better cell phone or something -- but they're putting it in very --

00:12:38.150 --> 00:12:42.150
areas and this will lead us into this kind of capability,

00:12:42.150 --> 00:12:44.150
and it will lead us into the next really big thing

00:12:44.150 --> 00:12:48.150
and it will allow us to explore. And I think eventually

00:12:48.150 --> 00:12:52.150
it will allow us to colonize and to keep us from going extinct.

00:12:52.150 --> 00:12:58.150
They were inspired by big progress. But look at the progress that's going on after that.

00:12:58.150 --> 00:13:00.150
There were a couple of examples here.

00:13:00.150 --> 00:13:04.150
The military fighters had a -- highest-performance military airplane

00:13:04.150 --> 00:13:09.150
was the SR71. It went a whole life cycle, got too rusty to fly,

00:13:09.150 --> 00:13:14.150
and was taken out of service. The Concorde doubled the speed for airline travel.

00:13:14.150 --> 00:13:17.150
It went a whole life cycle without competition,

00:13:17.150 --> 00:13:20.150
took out of service. And we're stuck back here

00:13:20.150 --> 00:13:23.150
with the same kind of capability for military fighters

00:13:23.150 --> 00:13:27.150
and commercial airline travel that we had back in the late '50s.

00:13:27.150 --> 00:13:31.150
But something is out there to inspire our kids now.

00:13:31.150 --> 00:13:33.150
And I'm talking about if you've got a baby now,

00:13:33.150 --> 00:13:34.150
or if you've got a 10-year-old now.

00:13:34.150 --> 00:13:40.150
What's out there is there's something really interesting going to happen here.

00:13:40.150 --> 00:13:42.150
Relatively soon, you'll be able to buy a ticket

00:13:42.150 --> 00:13:47.150
and fly higher and faster than the highest-performance

00:13:47.150 --> 00:13:51.150
military operational airplane. It's never happened before.

00:13:51.150 --> 00:13:56.150
The fact that they have stuck here with this kind of performance

00:13:56.150 --> 00:13:59.150
has been, well, you know, you win the war in 12 minutes;

00:13:59.150 --> 00:14:00.150
why do you need something better?

00:14:00.150 --> 00:14:03.150
But I think when you guys start buying tickets and flying

00:14:03.150 --> 00:14:08.150
sub-orbital flights to space, very soon -- wait a minute,

00:14:08.150 --> 00:14:11.150
what's happening here, we'll have military fighters

00:14:11.150 --> 00:14:14.150
with sub-orbital capability, and I think very soon this.

00:14:14.150 --> 00:14:18.150
But the interesting thing about it is the commercial guys are going to go first.

00:14:18.150 --> 00:14:24.150
OK, I look forward to a new "capitalist's space race," let's call it.

00:14:24.150 --> 00:14:28.150
You remember the space race in the '60s was for national prestige,

00:14:28.150 --> 00:14:31.150
because we lost the first two milestones.

00:14:31.150 --> 00:14:35.150
We didn't lose them technically. The fact that we had the hardware

00:14:35.150 --> 00:14:40.150
to put something in orbit when we let Von Braun fly it --

00:14:40.150 --> 00:14:42.150
you can argue that's not a technical loss.

00:14:42.150 --> 00:14:46.150
Sputnik wasn't a technical loss, but it was a prestige loss.

00:14:46.150 --> 00:14:53.150
America -- the world saw America as not being the leader in technology,

00:14:53.150 --> 00:14:55.150
and that was a very strong thing.

00:14:55.150 --> 00:15:00.150
And then we flew Alan Shepherd weeks after Gagarin,

00:15:00.150 --> 00:15:05.150
not months or decades, or whatever. So we had the capability.

00:15:05.150 --> 00:15:14.150
But America lost. We lost. And because of that, we made a big jump to recover it.

00:15:14.150 --> 00:15:17.150
Well, again, what's interesting here is we've lost

00:15:17.150 --> 00:15:20.150
to the Russians on the first couple of milestones already.

00:15:20.150 --> 00:15:25.150
You cannot buy a ticket commercially to fly into space in America --

00:15:25.150 --> 00:15:30.150
can't do it. You can buy it in Russia.

00:15:30.150 --> 00:15:33.150
You can fly with Russian hardware. This is available

00:15:33.150 --> 00:15:36.150
because a Russian space program is starving,

00:15:36.150 --> 00:15:41.150
and it's nice for them to get 20 million here and there to take one of the seats.

00:15:41.150 --> 00:15:48.150
It's commercial. It can be defined as space tourism. They are also offering a trip

00:15:48.150 --> 00:15:52.150
to go on this whip around the moon, like Apollo 8 was done.

00:15:52.150 --> 00:15:55.150
100 million bucks -- hey, I can go to the moon.

00:15:55.150 --> 00:15:58.150
But, you know, would you have thought back in the '60s,

00:15:58.150 --> 00:16:00.150
when the space race was going on,

00:16:00.150 --> 00:16:06.150
that the first commercial capitalist-like thing to do

00:16:06.150 --> 00:16:10.150
to buy a ticket to go to the moon would be in Russian hardware?

00:16:10.150 --> 00:16:13.150
And would you have thought, would the Russians have thought,

00:16:13.150 --> 00:16:17.150
that when they first go to the moon in their developed hardware,

00:16:17.150 --> 00:16:21.150
the guys inside won't be Russians? Maybe it'll probably be a Japanese

00:16:21.150 --> 00:16:25.150
or an American billionaire? Well, that's weird: you know, it really is.

00:16:25.150 --> 00:16:29.150
But anyway, I think we need to beat them again.

00:16:29.150 --> 00:16:36.150
I think what we'll do is we'll see a successful, very successful,

00:16:36.150 --> 00:16:41.150
private space flight industry. Whether we're first or not really doesn't matter.

00:16:41.150 --> 00:16:47.150
The Russians actually flew a supersonic transport before the Concorde.

00:16:47.150 --> 00:16:51.150
And then they flew a few cargo flights, and took it out of service.

00:16:51.150 --> 00:16:54.150
I think you kind of see the same kind of parallel

00:16:54.150 --> 00:16:58.150
when the commercial stuff is offered.

00:16:58.150 --> 00:17:02.150
OK, we'll talk just a little bit about commercial development for human space flight.

00:17:02.150 --> 00:17:04.150
This little thing says here: five times

00:17:04.150 --> 00:17:12.150
what NASA's doing by 2020. I want to tell you, already

00:17:12.150 --> 00:17:16.150
there's about 1.5 billion to 1.7 billion

00:17:16.150 --> 00:17:22.150
investment in private space flight that is not government at all --

00:17:22.150 --> 00:17:27.150
already, worldwide. If you read -- if you Google it,

00:17:27.150 --> 00:17:30.150
you'll find about half of that money, but there's twice of that

00:17:30.150 --> 00:17:34.150
being committed out there -- not spent yet, but being committed

00:17:34.150 --> 00:17:37.150
and planned for the next few years. Hey, that's pretty big.

00:17:37.150 --> 00:17:42.150
I'm predicting, though, as profitable as this industry is going to be --

00:17:42.150 --> 00:17:46.150
and it certainly is profitable when you fly people at 200,000 dollars

00:17:46.150 --> 00:17:50.150
on something that you can actually operate at a tenth of that cost,

00:17:50.150 --> 00:17:54.150
or less -- this is going to be very profitable.

00:17:54.150 --> 00:17:57.150
I predict, also, that the investment that will flow into this

00:17:57.150 --> 00:18:01.150
will be somewhere around half of what the U.S. taxpayer

00:18:01.150 --> 00:18:05.150
spends for NASA's manned spacecraft work.

00:18:05.150 --> 00:18:10.150
And every dollar that flows into that will be spent more efficiently

00:18:10.150 --> 00:18:18.150
by a factor of 10 to 15. And what that means is before we know it,

00:18:18.150 --> 00:18:25.150
the progress in human space flight, with no taxpayer dollars,

00:18:25.150 --> 00:18:31.150
will be at a level of about five times as much

00:18:31.150 --> 00:18:36.150
as the current NASA budgets for human space flight.

00:18:36.150 --> 00:18:44.150
And that is because it's us. It's private industry.

00:18:44.150 --> 00:18:50.150
You should never depend on the government to do this sort of stuff --

00:18:50.150 --> 00:18:53.150
and we've done it for a long time. The NACA, before NASA,

00:18:53.150 --> 00:18:57.150
never developed an airliner and never ran an airline.

00:18:57.150 --> 00:19:01.150
But NASA is developing the space liner, always has,

00:19:01.150 --> 00:19:08.150
and runs the only space line, OK. And we've shied away from it

00:19:08.150 --> 00:19:14.150
because we're afraid of it. But starting back in June of 2004,

00:19:14.150 --> 00:19:19.150
when I showed that a little group out there actually can do it,

00:19:19.150 --> 00:19:22.150
can get a start with it, everything changed after that time.

00:19:22.150 --> 00:19:24.150
OK, thank you very much.

00:19:24.150 --> 00:19:26.150
(Applause)
