00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:17.150
This is Aunt Zip from Sodom, North Carolina.

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:19.150
She was 105 years old when I took this picture.

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:23.150
She was always saying things that made me stop and think, like,

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:27.150
"Time may be a great healer, but it ain't no beauty specialist."

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.150
(Laughter)

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:33.150
She said, "Be good to your friends.

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:36.150
Why, without them, you'd be a total stranger."

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:37.150
(Laughter)

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:39.150
This is one of her songs.

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:42.150
Let's see if we can get into the flow here and all do this one together.

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:44.150
And I'm going to have Michael Manring play bass with me.

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:46.150
Give him a big old hand.

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:49.150
(Applause)

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:54.150
One, two, three, four.

00:00:54.150 --> 00:01:08.150
(Music)

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:10.150
Well, my true love's a black-eyed daisy;

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:12.150
if I don't see her, I go crazy.

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.150
My true love lives up the river;

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:16.150
a few more jumps and I'll be with her.

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:19.150
Hey, hey, black-eyed Susie! Hey, hey, black-eyed Susie!

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:22.150
Hey, hey black-eyed Susie, hey.

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:26.150
Now you've got to picture Aunt Zip at 105 years old in Sodom, North Carolina.

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:29.150
I'd go up and learn these old songs from her.

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:31.150
She couldn't sing much, couldn't play anymore.

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:34.150
And I'd pull her out on the front porch.

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:38.150
Down below, there was her grandson plowing the tobacco field with a mule.

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:41.150
A double outhouse over here on the side.

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:43.150
And we'd sing this old song. She didn't have a whole lot of energy,

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:46.150
so I'd sing, "Hey, hey!" and she'd just answer back with, "Black-eyed Susie."

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:50.150
Oh, hey, hey, black-eyed Susie! Hey, hey, black-eyed Susie!

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:53.150
Hey, hey, black-eyed Susie, hey.

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:55.150
Well, she and I went blackberry picking.

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:57.150
She got mad; I took a licking.

00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:59.150
Ducks on the millpond, geese in the ocean,

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:01.150
Devil in the pretty girl when she takes a notion.

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:04.150
Hey, hey, black-eyed Susie! Hey, hey, black-eyed Susie!

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:07.150
Hey, hey black-eyed Susie, hey.

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:09.150
Let's have the banjo.

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:25.150
Well, we'll get married next Thanksgiving.

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:27.150
I'll lay around; she'll make a living.

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:29.150
She'll cook blackjacks, I'll cook gravy;

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:31.150
we'll have chicken someday, maybe.

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:37.150
Hey, hey, hey, hey. Hey, hey, black-eyed Susie, hey!

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:38.150
One more time now.

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:42.150
Oh, hey, hey, black-eyed Susie! Hey, hey, black-eyed Susie!

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:45.150
Hey, hey, black-eyed Susie, hey.

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:57.150
(Applause)

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:59.150
Thank you, Michael.

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:03.150
This is Ralph Stanley.

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:06.150
When I was going to college at University of California

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:08.150
at Santa Barbara in the College of Creative Studies,

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:13.150
taking majors in biology and art, he came to the campus.

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:16.150
This was in 1968, I guess it was.

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:18.150
And he played his bluegrass style of music,

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:22.150
but near the end of the concert, he played the old timing style of banjo picking

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:24.150
that came from Africa, along with the banjo.

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:27.150
It's called claw-hammer style, that he had learned from his mother and grandmother.

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:29.150
I fell in love with that.

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:31.150
I went up to him and said, how can I learn that?

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:34.150
He said, well, you can go back to Clinch Mountain, where I'm from,

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:36.150
or Asheville or Mount Airy, North Carolina --

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:38.150
some place that has a lot of music.

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:41.150
Because there's a lot of old people still living that play that old style.

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:44.150
So I went back that very summer.

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:47.150
I just fell in love with the culture and the people.

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:51.150
And you know, I came back to school, I finished my degrees

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:54.150
and told my parents I wanted to be a banjo player.

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:57.150
You can imagine how excited they were.

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:00.150
So I thought I would just like to show you some of the pictures

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:02.150
I've taken of some of my mentors.

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:07.150
Just a few of them, but maybe you'll get just a little hint of some of these folks.

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:11.150
And play a little banjo. Let's do a little medley.

00:04:12.150 --> 00:05:46.150
(Music)

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:55.150
(Applause)

00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:58.150
Those last few pictures were of Ray Hicks, who just passed away last year.

00:05:58.150 --> 00:06:02.150
He was one of the great American folk tale-tellers.

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:05.150
The Old Jack tales that he had learned -- he talked like this,

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:08.150
you could hardly understand him. But it was really wonderful.

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:12.150
And he lived in that house that his great-grandfather had built.

00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:16.150
No running water, no electricity. A wonderful, wonderful guy.

00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:18.150
And you can look at more pictures.

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:21.150
I've actually got a website that's got a bunch of photos that I've done

00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:24.150
of some of the other folks I didn't get a chance to show you.

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:27.150
This instrument came up in those pictures. It's called the mouth bow.

00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:30.150
It is definitely the first stringed instrument ever in the world,

00:06:30.150 --> 00:06:34.150
and still played in the Southern mountains.

00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:39.150
Now, the old timers didn't take a fancy guitar string and make anything like this.

00:06:39.150 --> 00:06:44.150
They would just take a stick and a catgut and string it up.

00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:47.150
It was hard on the cats, but it made a great little instrument.

00:06:47.150 --> 00:06:49.150
It sounds something like this.

00:06:49.150 --> 00:07:02.150
(Music)

00:07:02.150 --> 00:07:06.150
Well, have you heard the many stories told by young and old with joy

00:07:06.150 --> 00:07:10.150
about the many deeds of daring that were done by the Johnson boys?

00:07:10.150 --> 00:07:14.150
You take Kate, I'll take Sal; we'll both have a Johnson gal.

00:07:14.150 --> 00:07:18.150
You take Kate, I'll take Sal; we'll both have a Johnson gal.

00:07:32.150 --> 00:07:34.150
Now, they were scouts in the rebels' army,

00:07:34.150 --> 00:07:36.150
they were known both far and wide.

00:07:36.150 --> 00:07:39.150
When the Yankees saw them coming, they'd lay down their guns and hide.

00:07:39.150 --> 00:07:43.150
You take Kate, I'll take Sal; we'll both have a Johnson gal.

00:07:43.150 --> 00:07:47.150
You take Kate, I'll take Sal; we'll both have a Johnson gal.

00:07:51.150 --> 00:07:53.150
Ain't that a sound?

00:07:53.150 --> 00:07:58.150
(Applause)

00:08:02.150 --> 00:08:06.150
Well, it was 1954, I guess it was.

00:08:06.150 --> 00:08:09.150
We were driving in the car outside of Gatesville, Texas,

00:08:09.150 --> 00:08:12.150
where I grew up in the early part of my life.

00:08:12.150 --> 00:08:14.150
Outside of Gatesville we were coming back from the grocery store.

00:08:14.150 --> 00:08:17.150
My mom was driving; my brother and I were in the back seat.

00:08:17.150 --> 00:08:20.150
We were really mad at my mom. We looked out the window.

00:08:20.150 --> 00:08:23.150
We were surrounded by thousands of acres of cotton fields.

00:08:23.150 --> 00:08:25.150
You see, we'd just been to the grocery store,

00:08:25.150 --> 00:08:29.150
and my mom refused to buy us the jar of Ovaltine

00:08:29.150 --> 00:08:33.150
that had the coupon for the Captain Midnight decoder ring in it.

00:08:33.150 --> 00:08:35.150
And, buddy, that made us mad.

00:08:35.150 --> 00:08:38.150
Well, my mom didn't put up with much either, and she was driving, and she said,

00:08:38.150 --> 00:08:41.150
"You boys! You think you can have anything you want.

00:08:41.150 --> 00:08:44.150
You don't know how hard it is to earn money. Your dad works so hard.

00:08:44.150 --> 00:08:46.150
You think money grows on trees. You've never worked a day in your lives.

00:08:46.150 --> 00:08:49.150
You boys make me so mad. You're going to get a job this summer."

00:08:49.150 --> 00:08:53.150
She pulled the car over; she said, "Get out of the car."

00:08:53.150 --> 00:08:55.150
My brother and I stepped out of the car.

00:08:55.150 --> 00:08:58.150
We were standing on the edge of thousands of acres of cotton.

00:08:58.150 --> 00:09:00.150
There were about a hundred black folks out there picking.

00:09:00.150 --> 00:09:03.150
My mom grabbed us by the shoulders. She marched us out in the field.

00:09:03.150 --> 00:09:05.150
She went up to the foreman; she said,

00:09:05.150 --> 00:09:08.150
"I've got these two little boys never worked a day in their lives."

00:09:08.150 --> 00:09:10.150
Of course, we were just eight and 10.

00:09:10.150 --> 00:09:11.150
(Laughter)

00:09:11.150 --> 00:09:13.150
She said, "Would you put them to work?"

00:09:13.150 --> 00:09:16.150
Well, that must have seemed like a funny idea to that foreman:

00:09:16.150 --> 00:09:19.150
put these two middle-class little white boys out in a cotton field

00:09:19.150 --> 00:09:21.150
in August in Texas -- it's hot.

00:09:21.150 --> 00:09:23.150
So he gave us each a cotton sack,

00:09:23.150 --> 00:09:26.150
about 10 feet long, about that big around, and we started picking.

00:09:26.150 --> 00:09:30.150
Now, cotton is soft but the outside of the plant is just full of stickers.

00:09:30.150 --> 00:09:32.150
And if you don't know what you're doing,

00:09:32.150 --> 00:09:34.150
your hands are bleeding in no time.

00:09:34.150 --> 00:09:36.150
And my brother and I started to pick it,

00:09:36.150 --> 00:09:39.150
and our hands were startin' to bleed, and then -- "Mom!"

00:09:39.150 --> 00:09:41.150
And Mom was just sitting by the car like this.

00:09:41.150 --> 00:09:44.150
She wasn't going to give up.

00:09:44.150 --> 00:09:48.150
Well, the foreman could see he was in over his head, I guess.

00:09:48.150 --> 00:09:52.150
He kind of just snuck up behind us and he sang out in a low voice.

00:09:52.150 --> 00:10:00.150
He just sang: "Well, there's a long white robe in heaven, I know.

00:10:00.150 --> 00:10:03.150
Don't want it to leave me behind.

00:10:03.150 --> 00:10:07.150
Well, there's a long white robe in heaven, I know.

00:10:07.150 --> 00:10:10.150
Don't want it to leave me behind."

00:10:10.150 --> 00:10:14.150
And from all around as people started singing and answering back, he sang:

00:10:14.150 --> 00:10:18.150
"Good news, good news: Chariot's coming.

00:10:18.150 --> 00:10:21.150
Good news: Chariot's coming.

00:10:21.150 --> 00:10:25.150
Good news: Chariot's coming.

00:10:25.150 --> 00:10:29.150
And I don't want it to leave me behind."

00:10:29.150 --> 00:10:31.150
Now, my brother and I had never heard anything like that

00:10:31.150 --> 00:10:34.150
in our whole lives. It was so beautiful.

00:10:34.150 --> 00:10:37.150
We sat there all day picking cotton, without complaining,

00:10:37.150 --> 00:10:39.150
without crying, while they sang things like:

00:10:39.150 --> 00:10:43.150
"Oh, Mary, don't you weep, don't you moan" and "Wade in the water,"

00:10:43.150 --> 00:10:46.150
and "I done done," "This little light of mine."

00:10:46.150 --> 00:10:48.150
Finally, by the end of the day,

00:10:48.150 --> 00:10:52.150
we'd each picked about a quarter of a bag of cotton.

00:10:52.150 --> 00:10:56.150
But the foreman was kind enough to give us each a check for a dollar,

00:10:56.150 --> 00:10:58.150
but my mother would never let us cash it.

00:10:58.150 --> 00:11:01.150
I'm 57; still have the check.

00:11:01.150 --> 00:11:06.150
Now, my mother hoped that we learned from that the value of hard work.

00:11:06.150 --> 00:11:09.150
But if you have children, you know it doesn't often work that way.

00:11:09.150 --> 00:11:11.150
No, we learned something else.

00:11:11.150 --> 00:11:13.150
The first thing I learned that day

00:11:13.150 --> 00:11:16.150
was that I never ever wanted to work that hard again.

00:11:16.150 --> 00:11:18.150
(Laughter)

00:11:18.150 --> 00:11:21.150
And pretty much never did.

00:11:24.150 --> 00:11:26.150
But I also learned that some people in this world

00:11:26.150 --> 00:11:30.150
do have to work that hard every day, and that was an eye-opener.

00:11:30.150 --> 00:11:35.150
And I also learned that a great song can make hard work go a little easier.

00:11:35.150 --> 00:11:40.150
And it also can bring the group together in a way that nothing else can.

00:11:41.150 --> 00:11:43.150
Now, I was just a little eight-year-old boy that day

00:11:43.150 --> 00:11:46.150
when my mama put me out of the car in that hot Texas cotton field.

00:11:46.150 --> 00:11:50.150
I wasn't even aware of music -- not even aware of it.

00:11:50.150 --> 00:11:52.150
But that day in the cotton field out there picking,

00:11:52.150 --> 00:11:54.150
when those people started singing,

00:11:54.150 --> 00:11:58.150
I realized I was in the very heart of real music,

00:11:58.150 --> 00:12:01.150
and that's where I've wanted to be ever since.

00:12:01.150 --> 00:12:03.150
Try this old song with me. I sing:

00:12:03.150 --> 00:12:07.150
Well, there's a long white robe in heaven, I know.

00:12:07.150 --> 00:12:10.150
You sing: Don't want it to leave me behind.

00:12:10.150 --> 00:12:14.150
Well, there's a long white robe in heaven, I know.

00:12:14.150 --> 00:12:17.150
Don't want it to leave me behind.

00:12:17.150 --> 00:12:21.150
Good news, good news: Chariot's coming.

00:12:21.150 --> 00:12:24.150
Good news: Chariot's coming.

00:12:24.150 --> 00:12:27.150
Good news: Chariot's coming.

00:12:27.150 --> 00:12:29.150
And I don't want it to leave me --

00:12:29.150 --> 00:12:34.150
It's been a while since you guys have been picking your last bale of cotton, isn't it?

00:12:34.150 --> 00:12:36.150
Let's try it one more time.

00:12:36.150 --> 00:12:40.150
There's a starry crown in heaven, I know.

00:12:40.150 --> 00:12:43.150
Don't want it to leave me behind.

00:12:43.150 --> 00:12:47.150
There's a starry crown in heaven, I know.

00:12:47.150 --> 00:12:50.150
Don't want it to leave me behind.

00:12:50.150 --> 00:12:54.150
Good news: Chariot's coming.

00:12:54.150 --> 00:12:57.150
Good news: Chariot's coming.

00:12:57.150 --> 00:13:01.150
Good news: Chariot's coming.

00:13:01.150 --> 00:13:04.150
And I don't want it to leave me behind.

00:13:04.150 --> 00:13:07.150
It was a few years ago, but I sort of remembered this story,

00:13:07.150 --> 00:13:09.150
and I told it at a concert.

00:13:09.150 --> 00:13:11.150
My mom was in the audience.

00:13:11.150 --> 00:13:13.150
After the -- she was glad to have a story about herself, of course,

00:13:13.150 --> 00:13:15.150
but after the concert she came up and she said,

00:13:15.150 --> 00:13:18.150
"David, I've got to tell you something.

00:13:18.150 --> 00:13:20.150
I set that whole thing up.

00:13:20.150 --> 00:13:24.150
I set it up with the foreman. I set it up with the owner of the land.

00:13:24.150 --> 00:13:26.150
I just wanted you boys to learn the value of hard work.

00:13:26.150 --> 00:13:30.150
I didn't know it was going to make you fall in love with music though."

00:13:30.150 --> 00:13:34.150
Let's try. Good news: Chariot's coming.

00:13:34.150 --> 00:13:37.150
Good news: Chariot's coming.

00:13:37.150 --> 00:13:41.150
Good news: Chariot's coming.

00:13:41.150 --> 00:13:45.150
And I don't want it to leave me behind.

00:13:48.150 --> 00:13:56.150
(Applause)

00:13:56.150 --> 00:14:00.150
Well, this is the steel guitar. It's an American-made instrument.

00:14:00.150 --> 00:14:03.150
It was originally made by the Dopyera Brothers,

00:14:03.150 --> 00:14:06.150
who later on made the Dobro, which is a wood-bodied instrument

00:14:06.150 --> 00:14:11.150
with a metal cone for -- where the sound comes from.

00:14:11.150 --> 00:14:13.150
It's usually played flat on your lap.

00:14:13.150 --> 00:14:15.150
It was made to play Hawaiian music back in the 1920s,

00:14:15.150 --> 00:14:18.150
before they had electric guitars, trying to make a loud guitar.

00:14:18.150 --> 00:14:22.150
And then African-American folks figured out you could take a broken bottle neck,

00:14:22.150 --> 00:14:26.150
just like that -- a nice Merlot works very well.

00:14:26.150 --> 00:14:29.150
That wine we had yesterday would have been perfect.

00:14:29.150 --> 00:14:32.150
Break it off, put it on your finger, and slide into the notes.

00:14:36.150 --> 00:14:38.150
This instrument pretty much saved my life.

00:14:40.150 --> 00:14:44.150
Fifteen years ago, 14 years ago, I guess, this year,

00:14:44.150 --> 00:14:48.150
my wife and I lost our daughter, Sarah Jane, in a car accident,

00:14:48.150 --> 00:14:54.150
and it was the most -- it almost took me out -- it almost took me out of this world.

00:14:54.150 --> 00:14:57.150
And I think I learned a lot about what happiness was

00:14:57.150 --> 00:15:00.150
by going through such unbelievable grief,

00:15:00.150 --> 00:15:03.150
just standing on the edge of that abyss and just wanting to jump in.

00:15:03.150 --> 00:15:08.150
I had to make lists of reasons to stay alive.

00:15:08.150 --> 00:15:10.150
I had to sit down and make lists, because I was ready to go;

00:15:10.150 --> 00:15:13.150
I was ready to check out of this world.

00:15:13.150 --> 00:15:15.150
And you know, at the top of the list, of course,

00:15:15.150 --> 00:15:19.150
were Jenny, and my son, Zeb, my parents -- I didn't want to hurt them.

00:15:19.150 --> 00:15:21.150
But then, when I thought about it beyond that,

00:15:21.150 --> 00:15:23.150
it was very simple things.

00:15:23.150 --> 00:15:26.150
I didn't care about -- I had a radio show,

00:15:26.150 --> 00:15:28.150
I have a radio show on public radio, "Riverwalk,"

00:15:28.150 --> 00:15:32.150
I didn't care about that. I didn't care about awards or money or anything.

00:15:32.150 --> 00:15:34.150
Nothing. Nothing.

00:15:34.150 --> 00:15:37.150
On the list it would be stuff like,

00:15:37.150 --> 00:15:43.150
seeing the daffodils bloom in the spring, the smell of new-mown hay,

00:15:43.150 --> 00:15:49.150
catching a wave and bodysurfing, the touch of a baby's hand,

00:15:49.150 --> 00:15:52.150
the sound of Doc Watson playing the guitar,

00:15:52.150 --> 00:15:56.150
listening to old records of Muddy Waters and Uncle Dave Macon.

00:15:56.150 --> 00:15:59.150
And for me, the sound of a steel guitar,

00:15:59.150 --> 00:16:03.150
because one of my parents' neighbors just gave me one of these things.

00:16:03.150 --> 00:16:05.150
And I would sit around with it, and I didn't know how to play it,

00:16:05.150 --> 00:16:11.150
but I would just play stuff as sad as I could play.

00:16:11.150 --> 00:16:13.150
And it was the only instrument that, of all the ones that I play,

00:16:13.150 --> 00:16:17.150
that would really make that connection.

00:16:17.150 --> 00:16:19.150
This is a song that came out of that.

00:16:20.150 --> 00:16:52.150
(Music)

00:16:52.150 --> 00:16:55.150
Well, I hear you're having trouble.

00:16:55.150 --> 00:16:58.150
Lord, I hate to hear that news.

00:16:58.150 --> 00:17:04.150
If you want to talk about it, you know, I will listen to you through.

00:17:04.150 --> 00:17:09.150
Words no longer say it; let me tell you what I always do.

00:17:13.150 --> 00:17:19.150
I just break off another bottleneck and play these steel guitar blues.

00:17:22.150 --> 00:17:25.150
People say, "Oh, snap out of it!"

00:17:25.150 --> 00:17:28.150
Oh yeah, that's easier said than done.

00:17:28.150 --> 00:17:32.150
While you can hardly move, they're running around having all kinds of fun.

00:17:34.150 --> 00:17:41.150
Sometimes I think it's better just to sink way down in your funky mood

00:17:42.150 --> 00:17:49.150
'til you can rise up humming these steel guitar blues.

00:17:52.150 --> 00:17:55.150
Now, you can try to keep it all inside

00:17:55.150 --> 00:17:58.150
with drink and drugs and cigarettes,

00:17:58.150 --> 00:18:03.150
but you know that's not going to get you where you want to get.

00:18:03.150 --> 00:18:09.150
But I got some medicine here that just might shake things loose.

00:18:13.150 --> 00:18:18.150
Call me in the morning after a dose of these steel guitar blues.

00:18:18.150 --> 00:18:20.150
Open up now.

00:18:54.150 --> 00:19:07.150
(Applause)

00:19:07.150 --> 00:19:10.150
Oh, I think I've got time to tell you about this. My dad was an inventor.

00:19:10.150 --> 00:19:14.150
We moved to California when Sputnik went up, in 1957.

00:19:14.150 --> 00:19:16.150
And he was working on gyroscopes;

00:19:16.150 --> 00:19:19.150
he has a number of patents for that kind of thing.

00:19:19.150 --> 00:19:22.150
And we moved across the street from Michael and John Whitney.

00:19:22.150 --> 00:19:24.150
They were about my age.

00:19:24.150 --> 00:19:26.150
John went on, and Michael did too,

00:19:26.150 --> 00:19:29.150
to become some of the inventors of computer animation.

00:19:29.150 --> 00:19:31.150
Michael's dad was working on something called the computer.

00:19:31.150 --> 00:19:34.150
This was 1957, I was a little 10-year-old kid;

00:19:34.150 --> 00:19:37.150
I didn't know what that was. But he took me down to see one,

00:19:37.150 --> 00:19:39.150
you know, what they were making. It was like a library,

00:19:39.150 --> 00:19:42.150
just full of vacuum tubes as far as you could see,

00:19:42.150 --> 00:19:44.150
just floors and floors of these things,

00:19:44.150 --> 00:19:46.150
and one of the engineers said,

00:19:46.150 --> 00:19:50.150
some day you're going to be able to put this thing in your pocket.

00:19:50.150 --> 00:19:53.150
I thought, damn, those are going to be some big pants!

00:19:53.150 --> 00:19:55.150
(Laughter)

00:19:55.150 --> 00:20:01.150
So that Christmas -- maybe I've got time for this --

00:20:01.150 --> 00:20:05.150
that Christmas I got the Mister Wizard Fun-o-Rama chemistry set.

00:20:05.150 --> 00:20:08.150
Well, I wanted to be an inventor just like my dad; so did Michael.

00:20:08.150 --> 00:20:10.150
His great-granddad had been Eli Whitney,

00:20:10.150 --> 00:20:12.150
the inventor of the cotton gin.

00:20:12.150 --> 00:20:14.150
So we looked in that --

00:20:14.150 --> 00:20:16.150
this was a commercial chemistry set.

00:20:16.150 --> 00:20:18.150
It had three chemicals we were really surprised to see:

00:20:18.150 --> 00:20:21.150
sulfur, potassium nitrate and charcoal.

00:20:21.150 --> 00:20:24.150
Man, we were only 10, but we knew that made gunpowder.

00:20:24.150 --> 00:20:27.150
We made up a little batch and we put it on the driveway

00:20:27.150 --> 00:20:30.150
and we threw a match and phew, it flared up. Ah, it was great.

00:20:30.150 --> 00:20:34.150
Well, obviously the next thing to do was build a cannon.

00:20:35.150 --> 00:20:37.150
So we went over into Michael's garage --

00:20:37.150 --> 00:20:40.150
his dad had all kinds of stuff, and we put a pipe in the vice there,

00:20:40.150 --> 00:20:42.150
and screwed a cap on the end of the pipe,

00:20:42.150 --> 00:20:45.150
drilled a hole in the back of the pipe, took some of our firecrackers,

00:20:45.150 --> 00:20:49.150
pulled out the fuses, tied them together, put them in the back there,

00:20:49.150 --> 00:20:52.150
and -- down in that hole -- and then stuffed some of our gunpowder

00:20:52.150 --> 00:20:57.150
down that pipe and put three ball bearings on the top, in the garage.

00:20:57.150 --> 00:20:58.150
(Laughter)

00:20:58.150 --> 00:21:02.150
We weren't stupid: we put up a sheet of plywood about five feet in front of it.

00:21:03.150 --> 00:21:05.150
We stood back, we lit that thing,

00:21:05.150 --> 00:21:09.150
and they flew out of there -- they went through that plywood like it was paper.

00:21:09.150 --> 00:21:11.150
Through the garage.

00:21:11.150 --> 00:21:14.150
Two of them landed in the side door of his new Citroen.

00:21:15.150 --> 00:21:18.150
(Laughter)

00:21:18.150 --> 00:21:22.150
We tore everything down and buried it in his backyard.

00:21:22.150 --> 00:21:26.150
That was Pacific Palisades; it probably is still there, back there.

00:21:26.150 --> 00:21:29.150
Well, my brother heard that we had made gunpowder.

00:21:29.150 --> 00:21:32.150
He and his buddies, they were older, and they were pretty mean.

00:21:32.150 --> 00:21:34.150
They said they were going to beat us up

00:21:34.150 --> 00:21:36.150
if we didn't make some gunpowder for them.

00:21:36.150 --> 00:21:38.150
We said, well, what are you going to do with it?

00:21:38.150 --> 00:21:42.150
They said, we're going to melt it down and make rocket fuel.

00:21:42.150 --> 00:21:44.150
(Laughter)

00:21:44.150 --> 00:21:47.150
Sure. We'll make you a big batch.

00:21:47.150 --> 00:21:50.150
(Laughter)

00:21:50.150 --> 00:21:52.150
So we made them a big batch, and it was in my --

00:21:52.150 --> 00:21:54.150
now, we'd just moved here. We'd just moved to California.

00:21:54.150 --> 00:21:58.150
Mom had redone the kitchen; Mom was gone that day. We had a pie tin.

00:21:58.150 --> 00:22:02.150
It became Chris Berquist's job to do the melting down.

00:22:02.150 --> 00:22:05.150
Michael and I were standing way at the side of the kitchen.

00:22:05.150 --> 00:22:08.150
He said, "Yeah, hey, it's melting. Yeah, the sulfur's melting.

00:22:08.150 --> 00:22:10.150
No problem. Yeah, you know."

00:22:10.150 --> 00:22:13.150
It just flared up, and he turned around, and he looked like this.

00:22:13.150 --> 00:22:17.150
No hair, no eyelashes, no nothing.

00:22:17.150 --> 00:22:20.150
There were big welts all over my mom's kitchen cabinet;

00:22:20.150 --> 00:22:22.150
the air was the just full of black smoke.

00:22:22.150 --> 00:22:28.150
She came home, she took that chemistry set away, and we never saw it again.

00:22:28.150 --> 00:22:31.150
But we thought of it often, because every time she'd cook tuna surprise

00:22:31.150 --> 00:22:34.150
it made -- tasted faintly of gunpowder.

00:22:35.150 --> 00:22:37.150
So I like to invent things too,

00:22:37.150 --> 00:22:42.150
and I think I'll close out my set with something I invented a good while back.

00:22:42.150 --> 00:22:44.150
When drum machines were new, I got to thinking,

00:22:44.150 --> 00:22:48.150
why couldn't you take the oldest form of music, the hambone rhythms,

00:22:48.150 --> 00:22:50.150
and combine it with the newest technology?

00:22:50.150 --> 00:22:52.150
I call this Thunderwear.

00:22:54.150 --> 00:22:56.150
At that time, drum triggers were new.

00:23:00.150 --> 00:23:05.150
And so I put them all together and sewed 12 of them in this suit.

00:23:10.150 --> 00:23:12.150
I showed you some of the hambone rhythms yesterday;

00:23:12.150 --> 00:23:14.150
I'm going to be doing some of the same ones.

00:23:14.150 --> 00:23:21.150
I have a trigger here, trigger here, here, here. Right there.

00:23:26.150 --> 00:23:30.150
It's going to really hurt if I don't take that off. Okay.

00:23:30.150 --> 00:23:37.150
Now, the drum triggers go out my tail here, into the drum machine,

00:23:37.150 --> 00:23:40.150
and they can make various sounds, like drums.

00:23:41.150 --> 00:23:44.150
So let me put them all together. And also, I can change the sounds

00:23:44.150 --> 00:23:47.150
by stepping on this pedal right here, and --

00:23:49.150 --> 00:23:52.150
let me just close out here by doing you a little

00:23:52.150 --> 00:23:54.150
hambone solo or something like this.

00:24:55.150 --> 00:24:57.150
Thank you, folks.

00:24:57.150 --> 00:25:06.150
(Applause)
