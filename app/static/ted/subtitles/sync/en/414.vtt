00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.150
So I understand that this meeting was planned,

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:20.150
and the slogan was From Was to Still.

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:25.150
And I am illustrating Still.

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:29.150
Which, of course, I am not agreeing with because,

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:33.150
although I am 94, I am not still working.

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:39.150
And anybody who asks me, "Are you still doing this or that?"

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:46.150
I don't answer because I'm not doing things still, I'm doing it like I always did.

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:52.150
I still have -- or did I use the word still? I didn't mean that.

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:56.150
(Laughter)

00:00:56.150 --> 00:01:06.150
I have my file which is called To Do. I have my plans.

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:11.150
I have my clients. I am doing my work like I always did.

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:17.150
So this takes care of my age.

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:25.150
I want to show you my work so you know what I am doing and why I am here.

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:28.150
This was about 1925.

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:37.150
All of these things were made during the last 75 years.

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.150
(Laughter)

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:46.150
(Applause)

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:50.150
But, of course, I'm working since 25,

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:55.150
doing more or less what you see here. This is Castleton China.

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:59.150
This was an exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art.

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:04.150
This is now for sale at the Metropolitan Museum.

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:08.150
This is still at the Metropolitan Museum now for sale.

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:14.150
This is a portrait of my daughter and myself.

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:26.150
(Applause)

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:30.150
These were just some of the things I've made.

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:35.150
I made hundreds of them for the last 75 years.

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:38.150
I call myself a maker of things.

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:46.150
I don't call myself an industrial designer because I'm other things.

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:51.150
Industrial designers want to make novel things.

00:02:52.150 --> 00:03:00.150
Novelty is a concept of commerce, not an aesthetic concept.

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:09.150
The industrial design magazine, I believe, is called "Innovation."

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:14.150
Innovation is not part of the aim of my work.

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:27.150
Well, makers of things: they make things more beautiful, more elegant,

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:32.150
more comfortable than just the craftsmen do.

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:37.150
I have so much to say. I have to think what I am going to say.

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:41.150
Well, to describe our profession otherwise,

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:47.150
we are actually concerned with the playful search for beauty.

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:56.150
That means the playful search for beauty was called the first activity of Man.

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:03.150
Sarah Smith, who was a mathematics professor at MIT, wrote,

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:09.150
"The playful search for beauty was Man's first activity --

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:16.150
that all useful qualities and all material qualities

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:22.150
were developed from the playful search for beauty."

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:29.150
These are tiles. The word, "playful" is a necessary aspect of our work

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:38.150
because, actually, one of our problems is that we have to make,

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:50.150
produce, lovely things throughout all of life, and this for me is now 75 years.

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:54.150
So how can you, without drying up,

00:04:54.150 --> 00:05:02.150
make things with the same pleasure, as a gift to others, for so long?

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:12.150
The playful is therefore an important part of our quality as designer.

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:20.150
Let me tell you some about my life.

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:28.150
As I said, I started to do these things 75 years ago.

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:34.150
My first exhibition in the United States

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:39.150
was at the Sesquicentennial exhibition in 1926 --

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:49.150
that the Hungarian government sent one of my hand-drawn pieces as part of the exhibit.

00:05:57.150 --> 00:06:05.150
My work actually took me through many countries,

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:08.150
and showed me a great part of the world.

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:12.150
This is not that they took me -- the work didn't take me --

00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:20.150
I made the things particularly because I wanted to use them to see the world.

00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:28.150
I was incredibly curious to see the world, and I made all these things,

00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:34.150
which then finally did take me to see many countries and many cultures.

00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:46.150
I started as an apprentice to a Hungarian craftsman,

00:06:46.150 --> 00:06:54.150
and this taught me what the guild system was in Middle Ages.

00:06:54.150 --> 00:06:59.150
The guild system: that means when I was an apprentice,

00:06:59.150 --> 00:07:05.150
I had to apprentice myself in order to become a pottery master.

00:07:08.150 --> 00:07:19.150
In my shop where I studied, or learned, there was a traditional hierarchy

00:07:21.150 --> 00:07:28.150
of master, journeyman and learned worker, and apprentice,

00:07:28.150 --> 00:07:31.150
and I worked as the apprentice.

00:07:33.150 --> 00:07:40.150
The work as an apprentice was very primitive.

00:07:40.150 --> 00:07:49.150
That means I had to actually learn every aspect of making pottery by hand.

00:07:49.150 --> 00:08:00.150
We mashed the clay with our feet when it came from the hillside.

00:08:02.150 --> 00:08:07.150
After that, it had to be kneaded. It had to then go in, kind of, a mangle.

00:08:07.150 --> 00:08:14.150
And then finally it was prepared for the throwing.

00:08:15.150 --> 00:08:19.150
And there I really worked as an apprentice.

00:08:19.150 --> 00:08:24.150
My master took me to set ovens

00:08:24.150 --> 00:08:32.150
because this was part of oven-making, oven-setting, in the time.

00:08:32.150 --> 00:08:37.150
And finally, I had received a document

00:08:37.150 --> 00:08:43.150
that I had accomplished my apprenticeship successfully,

00:08:43.150 --> 00:08:50.150
that I had behaved morally, and this document was given to me

00:08:50.150 --> 00:08:57.150
by the Guild of Roof-Coverers, Rail-Diggers, Oven-Setters,

00:08:57.150 --> 00:09:01.150
Chimney Sweeps and Potters.

00:09:01.150 --> 00:09:04.150
(Laughter)

00:09:04.150 --> 00:09:10.150
I also got at the time a workbook which explained my rights

00:09:10.150 --> 00:09:16.150
and my working conditions, and I still have that workbook.

00:09:16.150 --> 00:09:21.150
First I set up a shop in my own garden,

00:09:21.150 --> 00:09:26.150
and made pottery which I sold on the marketplace in Budapest.

00:09:27.150 --> 00:09:34.150
And there I was sitting, and my then-boyfriend --

00:09:34.150 --> 00:09:38.150
I didn't mean it was a boyfriend like it is meant today --

00:09:38.150 --> 00:09:43.150
but my boyfriend and I sat at the market and sold the pots.

00:09:43.150 --> 00:09:46.150
My mother thought that this was not very proper,

00:09:46.150 --> 00:09:55.150
so she sat with us to add propriety to this activity.

00:09:55.150 --> 00:09:57.150
(Laughter)

00:09:58.150 --> 00:10:04.150
However, after a while there was a new factory being built in Budapest,

00:10:04.150 --> 00:10:07.150
a pottery factory, a large one.

00:10:07.150 --> 00:10:14.150
And I visited it with several ladies, and asked all sorts of questions of the director.

00:10:14.150 --> 00:10:18.150
Then the director asked me, why do you ask all these questions?

00:10:18.150 --> 00:10:22.150
I said, I also have a pottery.

00:10:22.150 --> 00:10:27.150
So he asked me, could he please visit me, and then finally he did,

00:10:27.150 --> 00:10:33.150
and explained to me that what I did now in my shop was an anachronism,

00:10:33.150 --> 00:10:36.150
that the industrial revolution had broken out,

00:10:36.150 --> 00:10:39.150
and that I rather should join the factory.

00:10:39.150 --> 00:10:45.150
There he made an art department for me where I worked for several months.

00:10:45.150 --> 00:10:53.150
However, everybody in the factory spent his time at the art department.

00:10:53.150 --> 00:11:02.150
The director there said there were several women casting

00:11:02.150 --> 00:11:10.150
and producing my designs now in molds, and this was sold also to America.

00:11:10.150 --> 00:11:14.150
I remember that it was quite successful.

00:11:14.150 --> 00:11:21.150
However, the director, the chemist, model maker -- everybody --

00:11:21.150 --> 00:11:25.150
concerned himself much more with the art department --

00:11:25.150 --> 00:11:29.150
that means, with my work -- than making toilets,

00:11:29.150 --> 00:11:37.150
so finally they got a letter from the center, from the bank who owned the factory,

00:11:37.150 --> 00:11:42.150
saying, make toilet-setting behind the art department, and that was my end.

00:11:43.150 --> 00:11:47.150
So this gave me the possibility because now I was a journeyman,

00:11:47.150 --> 00:11:53.150
and journeymen also take their satchel and go to see the world.

00:11:53.150 --> 00:11:59.150
So as a journeyman, I put an ad into the paper that I had studied,

00:11:59.150 --> 00:12:03.150
that I was a down-to-earth potter's journeyman

00:12:03.150 --> 00:12:06.150
and I was looking for a job as a journeyman.

00:12:06.150 --> 00:12:11.150
And I got several answers, and I accepted the one

00:12:11.150 --> 00:12:17.150
which was farthest from home and practically, I thought, halfway to America.

00:12:17.150 --> 00:12:20.150
And that was in Hamburg.

00:12:20.150 --> 00:12:28.150
Then I first took this job in Hamburg, at an art pottery

00:12:28.150 --> 00:12:31.150
where everything was done on the wheel,

00:12:31.150 --> 00:12:38.150
and so I worked in a shop where there were several potters.

00:12:38.150 --> 00:12:48.150
And the first day, I was coming to take my place at the turntable --

00:12:48.150 --> 00:12:57.150
there were three or four turntables -- and one of them, behind where I was sitting,

00:12:57.150 --> 00:13:04.150
was a hunchback, a deaf-mute hunchback, who smelled very bad.

00:13:04.150 --> 00:13:11.150
So I doused him in cologne every day, which he thought was very nice,

00:13:11.150 --> 00:13:16.150
and therefore he brought bread and butter every day,

00:13:16.150 --> 00:13:19.150
which I had to eat out of courtesy.

00:13:19.150 --> 00:13:23.150
The first day I came to work in this shop

00:13:23.150 --> 00:13:29.150
there was on my wheel a surprise for me.

00:13:30.150 --> 00:13:42.150
My colleagues had thoughtfully put on the wheel where I was supposed to work

00:13:42.150 --> 00:13:48.150
a very nicely modeled natural man's organs.

00:13:48.150 --> 00:13:52.150
(Laughter)

00:13:54.150 --> 00:13:59.150
After I brushed them off with a hand motion, they were very --

00:13:59.150 --> 00:14:05.150
I finally was now accepted, and worked there for some six months.

00:14:06.150 --> 00:14:09.150
This was my first job.

00:14:11.150 --> 00:14:15.150
If I go on like this, you will be here till midnight.

00:14:15.150 --> 00:14:17.150
(Laughter)

00:14:17.150 --> 00:14:21.150
(Applause)

00:14:21.150 --> 00:14:24.150
So I will try speed it up a little

00:14:24.150 --> 00:14:26.150
(Laughter)

00:14:26.150 --> 00:14:28.150
Moderator: Eva, we have about five minutes.

00:14:28.150 --> 00:14:32.150
(Laughter)

00:14:33.150 --> 00:14:35.150
Eva Zeisel: Are you sure?

00:14:36.150 --> 00:14:39.150
Moderator: Yes, I am sure.

00:14:39.150 --> 00:14:41.150
EZ: Well, if you are sure,

00:14:41.150 --> 00:14:46.150
I have to tell you that within five minutes I will talk very fast.

00:14:46.150 --> 00:14:54.150
And actually, my work took me to many countries

00:14:54.150 --> 00:14:59.150
because I used my work to fill my curiosity.

00:14:59.150 --> 00:15:06.150
And among other things, other countries I worked, was in the Soviet Union,

00:15:06.150 --> 00:15:14.150
where I worked from '32 to '37 -- actually, to '36.

00:15:14.150 --> 00:15:20.150
I was finally there, although I had nothing to do -- I was a foreign expert.

00:15:20.150 --> 00:15:23.150
I became art director of the china and glass industry,

00:15:23.150 --> 00:15:34.150
and eventually under Stalin's purges -- at the beginning of Stalin's purges,

00:15:34.150 --> 00:15:40.150
I didn't know that hundreds of thousands of innocent people were arrested.

00:15:40.150 --> 00:15:45.150
So I was arrested quite early in Stalin's purges,

00:15:45.150 --> 00:15:53.150
and spent 16 months in a Russian prison.

00:15:53.150 --> 00:16:01.150
The accusation was that I had successfully prepared an Attentat on Stalin's life.

00:16:01.150 --> 00:16:07.150
This was a very dangerous accusation.

00:16:07.150 --> 00:16:14.150
And if this is the end of my five minutes, I want to tell you that

00:16:14.150 --> 00:16:19.150
I actually did survive, which was a surprise.

00:16:21.150 --> 00:16:24.150
But since I survived and I'm here,

00:16:24.150 --> 00:16:28.150
and since this is the end of the five minutes, I will --

00:16:28.150 --> 00:16:30.150
Moderator: Tell me when your last trip to Russia was.

00:16:30.150 --> 00:16:32.150
Weren't you there recently?

00:16:32.150 --> 00:16:35.150
EZ: Oh, this summer, in fact,

00:16:35.150 --> 00:16:46.150
the Lomonosov factory was bought by an American company, invited me.

00:16:47.150 --> 00:16:51.150
They found out that I had worked in '33 at this factory,

00:16:51.150 --> 00:16:58.150
and they came to my studio in Rockland County,

00:16:58.150 --> 00:17:04.150
and brought the 15 of their artists to visit me here.

00:17:04.150 --> 00:17:10.150
And they invited myself to come to the Russian factory last summer,

00:17:10.150 --> 00:17:15.150
in July, to make some dishes, design some dishes.

00:17:15.150 --> 00:17:23.150
And since I don't like to travel alone, they also invited my daughter,

00:17:23.150 --> 00:17:25.150
son-in-law and granddaughter,

00:17:25.150 --> 00:17:30.150
so we had a lovely trip to see Russia today,

00:17:30.150 --> 00:17:34.150
which is not a very pleasant and happy view.

00:17:35.150 --> 00:17:40.150
Here I am now, if this is the end? Thank you.

00:17:40.150 --> 00:18:03.150
(Applause)
