00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.150
I was walking in the market one day with my wife,

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:17.150
and somebody stuck a cage in my face.

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:19.150
And in between those slits

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:21.150
were the saddest eyes I've ever seen.

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.150
There was a very sick orangutan baby, my first encounter.

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.150
That evening I came back to the market in the dark

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.150
and I heard "uhh, uhh,"

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:35.150
and sure enough I found a dying orangutan baby on a garbage heap.

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:37.150
Of course, the cage was salvaged.

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:39.150
I took up the little baby,

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:42.150
massaged her, forced her to drink

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:45.150
until she finally started breathing normally.

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:47.150
This is Uce.

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:49.150
She's now living in the jungle of Sungai Wain,

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:51.150
and this is Matahari, her second son,

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:56.150
which, by the way, is also the son of the second orangutan I rescued, Dodoy.

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:58.150
That changed my life quite dramatically,

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:03.150
and as of today, I have almost 1,000 babies in my two centers.

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:05.150
(Applause)

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:07.150
No. No. No. Wrong.

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:10.150
It's horrible. It's a proof of our failing to save them in the wild.

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:12.150
It's not good.

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:16.150
This is merely proof of everyone failing to do the right thing.

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:20.150
Having more than all the orangutans in all the zoos in the world together,

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:23.150
just now like victims for every baby,

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:26.150
six have disappeared from the forest.

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:28.150
The deforestation, especially for oil palm,

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:31.150
to provide biofuel for Western countries

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:34.150
is what's causing these problems.

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:37.150
And those are the peat swamp forests on 20 meters of peat,

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:40.150
the largest accumulation of organic material in the world.

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:43.150
When you open this for growing oil palms

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:45.150
you're creating CO2 volcanoes

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:48.150
that are emitting so much CO2

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:53.150
that my country is now the third largest emitter of greenhouse gasses in the world,

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:55.150
after China and the United States.

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:58.150
And we don't have any industry at all --

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:01.150
it's only because of this deforestation.

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:04.150
And these are horrible images.

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:06.150
I'm not going to talk too long about it,

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:08.150
but there are so many of the family of Uce,

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:12.150
which are not so fortunate to live out there in the forest,

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:14.150
that still have to go through that process.

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:16.150
And I don't know anymore where to put them.

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:20.150
So I decided that I had to come up with a solution for her

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:22.150
but also a solution

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:26.150
that will benefit the people that are trying to exploit those forests,

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:29.150
to get their hands on the last timber

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:32.150
and that are causing, in that way,

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:35.150
the loss of habitat and all those victims.

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:37.150
So I created the place Samboja Lestari,

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:39.150
and the idea was,

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:42.150
if I can do this on the worst possible place that I can think of

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:44.150
where there is really nothing left,

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:48.150
no one will have an excuse to say, "Yeah, but ..."

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:52.150
No. Everyone should be able to follow this.

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:57.150
So we're in East Borneo. This is the place where I started.

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:59.150
As you can see there's only yellow terrain.

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:02.150
There's nothing left -- just a bit of grass there.

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:06.150
In 2002 we had about 50 percent of the people jobless there.

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:08.150
There was a huge amount of crime.

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:13.150
People spent so much of their money on health issues and drinking water.

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:16.150
There was no agricultural productivity left.

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:19.150
This was the poorest district in the whole province

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:22.150
and it was a total extinction of wildlife.

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:24.150
This was like a biological desert.

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:28.150
When I stood there in the grass, it's hot -- not even the sound of insects --

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:30.150
just this waving grass.

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:35.150
Still, four years later we have created jobs for about 3,000 people.

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:38.150
The climate has changed. I will show you:

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:40.150
no more flooding, no more fires.

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:43.150
It's no longer the poorest district,

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:45.150
and there is a huge development of biodiversity.

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:51.150
We've got over 1,000 species. We have 137 bird species as of today.

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:53.150
We have 30 species of reptiles.

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:59.150
So what happened here? We created a huge economic failure in this forest.

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:02.150
So basically the whole process of destruction

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:05.150
had gone a bit slower than what is happening now with the oil palm.

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:07.150
But we saw the same thing.

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:09.150
We had slash and burn agriculture;

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:11.150
people cannot afford the fertilizer,

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:14.150
so they burn the trees and have the minerals available there;

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:16.150
the fires become more frequent,

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:19.150
and after a while you're stuck with an area of land

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:21.150
where there is no fertility left.

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:23.150
There are no trees left.

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:26.150
Still, in this place, in this grassland

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:29.150
where you can see our very first office there on that hill,

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:34.150
four years later, there is this one green blop on the Earth's surface ...

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:36.150
(Applause)

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:39.150
And there are all these animals, and all these people happy,

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:41.150
and there's this economic value.

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:43.150
So how's this possible?

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:45.150
It was quite simple. If you'll look at the steps:

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:47.150
we bought the land, we dealt with the fire,

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:50.150
and then only, we started doing the reforestation

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:53.150
by combining agriculture with forestry.

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:57.150
Only then we set up the infrastructure and management and the monetary.

00:04:57.150 --> 00:05:00.150
But we made sure that in every step of the way

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:03.150
the local people were going to be fully involved

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:07.150
so that no outside forces would be able to interfere with that.

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:11.150
The people would become the defenders of that forest.

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:13.150
So we do the "people, profit, planet" principles,

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:15.150
but we do it in addition

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:17.150
to a sure legal status --

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:19.150
because if the forest belongs to the state,

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:22.150
people say, "It belongs to me, it belongs to everyone."

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:25.150
And then we apply all these other principles

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:29.150
like transparency, professional management, measurable results,

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:32.150
scalability, [unclear], etc.

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:35.150
What we did was we formulated recipes --

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:38.150
how to go from a starting situation where you have nothing

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:40.150
to a target situation.

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:45.150
You formulate a recipe based upon the factors you can control,

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:49.150
whether it be the skills or the fertilizer or the plant choice.

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:54.150
And then you look at the outputs and you start measuring what comes out.

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:56.150
Now in this recipe you also have the cost.

00:05:56.150 --> 00:05:59.150
You also know how much labor is needed.

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:02.150
If you can drop this recipe on the map

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:04.150
on a sandy soil, on a clay soil,

00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:06.150
on a steep slope, on flat soil,

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:09.150
you put those different recipes; if you combine them,

00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:11.150
out of that comes a business plan,

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:14.150
comes a work plan, and you can optimize it

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:18.150
for the amount of labor you have available or for the amount of fertilizer you have,

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:20.150
and you can do it.

00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:24.150
This is how it looks like in practice. We have this grass we want to get rid of.

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:27.150
It exudes [unclear]-like compounds from the roots.

00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:30.150
The acacia trees are of a very low value

00:06:30.150 --> 00:06:33.150
but we need them to restore the micro-climate, to protect the soil

00:06:33.150 --> 00:06:36.150
and to shake out the grasses.

00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:39.150
And after eight years they might actually yield some timber --

00:06:39.150 --> 00:06:42.150
that is, if you can preserve it in the right way,

00:06:42.150 --> 00:06:44.150
which we can do with bamboo peels.

00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:47.150
It's an old temple-building technique from Japan

00:06:47.150 --> 00:06:49.150
but bamboo is very fire-susceptible.

00:06:49.150 --> 00:06:51.150
So if we would plant that in the beginning

00:06:51.150 --> 00:06:55.150
we would have a very high risk of losing everything again.

00:06:55.150 --> 00:06:57.150
So we plant it later, along the waterways

00:06:57.150 --> 00:06:59.150
to filter the water, provide the raw products

00:06:59.150 --> 00:07:02.150
just in time for when the timber becomes available.

00:07:02.150 --> 00:07:05.150
So the idea is: how to integrate these flows

00:07:05.150 --> 00:07:10.150
in space, over time and with the limited means you have.

00:07:10.150 --> 00:07:12.150
So we plant the trees, we plant these pineapples

00:07:12.150 --> 00:07:16.150
and beans and ginger in between, to reduce the competition for the trees,

00:07:16.150 --> 00:07:21.150
the crop fertilizer. Organic material is useful for the agricultural crops,

00:07:21.150 --> 00:07:24.150
for the people, but also helps the trees. The farmers have free land,

00:07:24.150 --> 00:07:28.150
the system yields early income, the orangutans get healthy food

00:07:28.150 --> 00:07:31.150
and we can speed up ecosystem regeneration

00:07:31.150 --> 00:07:33.150
while even saving some money.

00:07:33.150 --> 00:07:35.150
So beautiful. What a theory.

00:07:35.150 --> 00:07:38.150
But is it really that easy?

00:07:38.150 --> 00:07:41.150
Not really, because if you looked at what happened in 1998,

00:07:41.150 --> 00:07:43.150
the fire started.

00:07:43.150 --> 00:07:45.150
This is an area of about 50 million hectares.

00:07:45.150 --> 00:07:46.150
January.

00:07:47.150 --> 00:07:48.150
February.

00:07:49.150 --> 00:07:50.150
March.

00:07:51.150 --> 00:07:52.150
April.

00:07:52.150 --> 00:07:53.150
May.

00:07:53.150 --> 00:07:57.150
We lost 5.5 million hectares in just a matter of a few months.

00:07:57.150 --> 00:08:00.150
This is because we have 10,000 of those underground fires

00:08:00.150 --> 00:08:04.150
that you also have in Pennsylvania here in the United States.

00:08:04.150 --> 00:08:07.150
And once the soil gets dried, you're in a dry season -- you get cracks,

00:08:07.150 --> 00:08:11.150
oxygen goes in, flames come out and the problem starts all over again.

00:08:11.150 --> 00:08:13.150
So how to break that cycle?

00:08:13.150 --> 00:08:15.150
Fire is the biggest problem.

00:08:15.150 --> 00:08:18.150
This is what it looked like for three months.

00:08:18.150 --> 00:08:21.150
For three months, the automatic lights outside did not go off

00:08:21.150 --> 00:08:23.150
because it was that dark.

00:08:23.150 --> 00:08:27.150
We lost all the crops. No children gained weight for over a year;

00:08:27.150 --> 00:08:30.150
they lost 12 IQ points. It was a disaster

00:08:30.150 --> 00:08:32.150
for orangutans and people.

00:08:32.150 --> 00:08:35.150
So these fires are really the first things to work on.

00:08:35.150 --> 00:08:37.150
That was why I put it as a single point up there.

00:08:38.150 --> 00:08:41.150
And you need the local people for that because these grasslands,

00:08:41.150 --> 00:08:45.150
once they start burning ... It goes through it like a windstorm

00:08:45.150 --> 00:08:48.150
and you lose again the last bit of ash and nutrients

00:08:48.150 --> 00:08:50.150
to the first rainfall -- going to the sea

00:08:50.150 --> 00:08:53.150
killing off the coral reefs there.

00:08:53.150 --> 00:08:55.150
So you have to do it with the local people.

00:08:55.150 --> 00:08:58.150
That is the short-term solution but you also need a long-term solution.

00:08:58.150 --> 00:09:00.150
So what we did is, we created

00:09:00.150 --> 00:09:03.150
a ring of sugar palms around the area.

00:09:03.150 --> 00:09:06.150
These sugar palms turn out to be fire-resistant --

00:09:06.150 --> 00:09:08.150
also flood-resistant, by the way --

00:09:08.150 --> 00:09:12.150
and they provide a lot of income for local people.

00:09:12.150 --> 00:09:14.150
This is what it looks like:

00:09:14.150 --> 00:09:17.150
the people have to tap them twice a day -- just a millimeter slice --

00:09:17.150 --> 00:09:20.150
and the only thing you harvest is sugar water,

00:09:20.150 --> 00:09:24.150
carbon dioxide, rain fall and a little bit of sunshine.

00:09:24.150 --> 00:09:26.150
In principle, you make those trees into

00:09:26.150 --> 00:09:29.150
biological photovoltaic cells.

00:09:29.150 --> 00:09:32.150
And you can create so much energy from this --

00:09:32.150 --> 00:09:37.150
they produce three times more energy per hectare per year,

00:09:37.150 --> 00:09:39.150
because you can tap them on a daily basis.

00:09:39.150 --> 00:09:41.150
You don't need to harvest [unclear]

00:09:41.150 --> 00:09:43.150
or any other of the crops.

00:09:43.150 --> 00:09:47.150
So this is the combination where we have all this genetic potential in the tropics,

00:09:47.150 --> 00:09:51.150
which is still unexploited, and doing it in combination with technology.

00:09:51.150 --> 00:09:55.150
But also your legal side needs to be in very good order.

00:09:55.150 --> 00:09:57.150
So we bought that land,

00:09:57.150 --> 00:09:59.150
and here is where we started our project --

00:09:59.150 --> 00:10:01.150
in the middle of nowhere.

00:10:01.150 --> 00:10:05.150
And if you zoom in a bit you can see that all of this area

00:10:05.150 --> 00:10:08.150
is divided into strips that go over different types of soil,

00:10:08.150 --> 00:10:11.150
and we were actually monitoring,

00:10:11.150 --> 00:10:17.150
measuring every single tree in these 2,000 hectares, 5,000 acres.

00:10:17.150 --> 00:10:20.150
And this forest is quite different.

00:10:20.150 --> 00:10:22.150
What I really did was I just followed nature,

00:10:22.150 --> 00:10:25.150
and nature doesn't know monocultures,

00:10:25.150 --> 00:10:28.150
but a natural forest is multilayered.

00:10:28.150 --> 00:10:30.150
That means that both in the ground and above the ground

00:10:30.150 --> 00:10:33.150
it can make better use of the available light,

00:10:33.150 --> 00:10:38.150
it can store more carbon in the system, it can provide more functions.

00:10:38.150 --> 00:10:42.150
But, it's more complicated. It's not that simple, and you have to work with the people.

00:10:42.150 --> 00:10:45.150
So, just like nature,

00:10:45.150 --> 00:10:48.150
we also grow fast planting trees and underneath that,

00:10:48.150 --> 00:10:54.150
we grow the slower growing, primary-grain forest trees of a very high diversity

00:10:54.150 --> 00:10:56.150
that can optimally use that light. Then,

00:10:56.150 --> 00:11:00.150
what is just as important: get the right fungi in there

00:11:00.150 --> 00:11:03.150
that will grow into those leaves, bring back the nutrients

00:11:03.150 --> 00:11:07.150
to the roots of the trees that have just dropped that leaf within 24 hours.

00:11:07.150 --> 00:11:09.150
And they become like nutrient pumps.

00:11:09.150 --> 00:11:12.150
You need the bacteria to fix nitrogen,

00:11:12.150 --> 00:11:17.150
and without those microorganisms, you won't have any performance at all.

00:11:17.150 --> 00:11:21.150
And then we started planting -- only 1,000 trees a day.

00:11:21.150 --> 00:11:24.150
We could have planted many, many more, but we didn't want to

00:11:24.150 --> 00:11:27.150
because we wanted to keep the number of jobs stable.

00:11:27.150 --> 00:11:30.150
We didn't want to lose the people

00:11:30.150 --> 00:11:34.150
that are going to work in that plantation.

00:11:34.150 --> 00:11:36.150
And we do a lot of work here.

00:11:36.150 --> 00:11:39.150
We use indicator plants to look at what soil types,

00:11:39.150 --> 00:11:42.150
or what vegetables will grow, or what trees will grow here.

00:11:42.150 --> 00:11:47.150
And we have monitored every single one of those trees from space.

00:11:47.150 --> 00:11:49.150
This is what it looks like in reality;

00:11:49.150 --> 00:11:51.150
you have this irregular ring around it,

00:11:51.150 --> 00:11:55.150
with strips of 100 meters wide, with sugar palms

00:11:55.150 --> 00:11:58.150
that can provide income for 648 families.

00:11:58.150 --> 00:12:01.150
It's only a small part of the area.

00:12:01.150 --> 00:12:04.150
The nursery, in here, is quite different.

00:12:04.150 --> 00:12:07.150
If you look at the number of tree species we have in Europe, for instance,

00:12:07.150 --> 00:12:10.150
from the Urals up to England, you know how many?

00:12:10.150 --> 00:12:12.150
165.

00:12:12.150 --> 00:12:16.150
In this nursery, we're going to grow 10 times more than the number of species.

00:12:16.150 --> 00:12:18.150
Can you imagine?

00:12:18.150 --> 00:12:20.150
You do need to know what you are working with,

00:12:20.150 --> 00:12:23.150
but it's that diversity which makes it work.

00:12:23.150 --> 00:12:26.150
That you can go from this zero situation,

00:12:26.150 --> 00:12:30.150
by planting the vegetables and the trees, or directly, the trees

00:12:30.150 --> 00:12:32.150
in the lines in that grass there,

00:12:32.150 --> 00:12:35.150
putting up the buffer zone, producing your compost,

00:12:35.150 --> 00:12:40.150
and then making sure that at every stage of that up growing forest

00:12:40.150 --> 00:12:42.150
there are crops that can be used.

00:12:42.150 --> 00:12:44.150
In the beginning, maybe pineapples and beans and corn;

00:12:44.150 --> 00:12:47.150
in the second phase, there will be bananas and papayas;

00:12:47.150 --> 00:12:50.150
later on, there will be chocolate and chilies.

00:12:50.150 --> 00:12:52.150
And then slowly, the trees start taking over,

00:12:52.150 --> 00:12:56.150
bringing in produce from the fruits, from the timber, from the fuel wood.

00:12:56.150 --> 00:12:59.150
And finally, the sugar palm forest takes over

00:12:59.150 --> 00:13:01.150
and provides the people with permanent income.

00:13:01.150 --> 00:13:04.150
On the top left, underneath those green stripes,

00:13:04.150 --> 00:13:08.150
you see some white dots -- those are actually individual pineapple plants

00:13:08.150 --> 00:13:10.150
that you can see from space.

00:13:10.150 --> 00:13:15.150
And in that area we started growing some acacia trees

00:13:15.150 --> 00:13:17.150
that you just saw before.

00:13:17.150 --> 00:13:19.150
So this is after one year.

00:13:19.150 --> 00:13:21.150
And this is after two years.

00:13:21.150 --> 00:13:24.150
And that's green. If you look from the tower --

00:13:24.150 --> 00:13:27.150
this is when we start attacking the grass.

00:13:27.150 --> 00:13:29.150
We plant in the seedlings

00:13:29.150 --> 00:13:33.150
mixed with the bananas, the papayas, all the crops for the local people,

00:13:33.150 --> 00:13:36.150
but the trees are growing up fast in between as well.

00:13:36.150 --> 00:13:39.150
And three years later, 137 species of birds are living here.

00:13:39.150 --> 00:13:45.150
(Applause)

00:13:45.150 --> 00:13:49.150
So we lowered air temperature three to five degrees Celsius.

00:13:49.150 --> 00:13:51.150
Air humidity is up 10 percent.

00:13:51.150 --> 00:13:53.150
Cloud cover -- I'm going to show it to you -- is up.

00:13:53.150 --> 00:13:55.150
Rainfall is up.

00:13:55.150 --> 00:13:57.150
And all these species and income.

00:13:57.150 --> 00:13:59.150
This ecolodge that I built here,

00:13:59.150 --> 00:14:02.150
three years before, was an empty, yellow field.

00:14:02.150 --> 00:14:06.150
This transponder that we operate with the European Space Agency --

00:14:06.150 --> 00:14:10.150
it gives us the benefit that every satellite that comes over to calibrate itself

00:14:10.150 --> 00:14:12.150
is taking a picture.

00:14:12.150 --> 00:14:16.150
Those pictures we use to analyze how much carbon, how the forest is developing,

00:14:16.150 --> 00:14:22.150
and we can monitor every tree using satellite images through our cooperation.

00:14:22.150 --> 00:14:24.150
We can use these data now

00:14:24.150 --> 00:14:28.150
to provide other regions with recipes and the same technology.

00:14:28.150 --> 00:14:30.150
We actually have it already with Google Earth.

00:14:30.150 --> 00:14:34.150
If you would use a little bit of your technology to put tracking devices in trucks,

00:14:34.150 --> 00:14:37.150
and use Google Earth in combination with that,

00:14:37.150 --> 00:14:41.150
you could directly tell what palm oil has been sustainably produced,

00:14:41.150 --> 00:14:44.150
which company is stealing the timber,

00:14:44.150 --> 00:14:46.150
and you could save so much more carbon

00:14:46.150 --> 00:14:49.150
than with any measure of saving energy here.

00:14:49.150 --> 00:14:52.150
So this is the Samboja Lestari area.

00:14:52.150 --> 00:14:54.150
You measure how the trees grow back,

00:14:54.150 --> 00:14:58.150
but you can also measure the biodiversity coming back.

00:14:58.150 --> 00:15:02.150
And biodiversity is an indicator of how much water can be balanced,

00:15:02.150 --> 00:15:05.150
how many medicines can be kept here.

00:15:05.150 --> 00:15:08.150
And finally I made it into the rain machine

00:15:08.150 --> 00:15:11.150
because this forest is now creating its own rain.

00:15:11.150 --> 00:15:15.150
This nearby city of Balikpapan has a big problem with water;

00:15:15.150 --> 00:15:18.150
it's 80 percent surrounded by seawater,

00:15:18.150 --> 00:15:20.150
and we have now a lot of intrusion there.

00:15:20.150 --> 00:15:23.150
Now we looked at the clouds above this forest;

00:15:23.150 --> 00:15:27.150
we looked at the reforestation area, the semi-open area and the open area.

00:15:27.150 --> 00:15:30.150
And look at these images.

00:15:30.150 --> 00:15:32.150
I'll just run them very quickly through.

00:15:32.150 --> 00:15:35.150
In the tropics, raindrops are not formed from ice crystals,

00:15:35.150 --> 00:15:37.150
which is the case in the temperate zones,

00:15:37.150 --> 00:15:42.150
you need the trees with [unclear], chemicals that come out of the leaves of the trees

00:15:42.150 --> 00:15:44.150
that initiate the raindrops.

00:15:44.150 --> 00:15:48.150
So you create a cool place where clouds can accumulate,

00:15:48.150 --> 00:15:50.150
and you have the trees to initiate the rain.

00:15:50.150 --> 00:15:54.150
And look, there's now 11.2 percent more clouds --

00:15:54.150 --> 00:15:56.150
already, after three years.

00:15:56.150 --> 00:16:01.150
If you look at rainfall, it was already up 20 percent at that time.

00:16:01.150 --> 00:16:03.150
Let's look at the next year,

00:16:03.150 --> 00:16:05.150
and you can see that that trend is continuing.

00:16:05.150 --> 00:16:08.150
Where at first we had a small cap of higher rainfall,

00:16:08.150 --> 00:16:11.150
that cap is now widening and getting higher.

00:16:11.150 --> 00:16:14.150
And if we look at the rainfall pattern

00:16:14.150 --> 00:16:18.150
above Samboja Lestari, it used to be the driest place,

00:16:18.150 --> 00:16:22.150
but now you see consistently see a peak of rain forming there.

00:16:22.150 --> 00:16:26.150
So you can actually change the climate.

00:16:26.150 --> 00:16:30.150
When there are trade winds of course the effect disappears,

00:16:30.150 --> 00:16:33.150
but afterwards, as soon as the wind stabilizes,

00:16:33.150 --> 00:16:37.150
you see again that the rainfall peaks come back above this area.

00:16:37.150 --> 00:16:42.150
So to say it is hopeless is not the right thing to do,

00:16:42.150 --> 00:16:44.150
because we actually can make that difference

00:16:44.150 --> 00:16:48.150
if you integrate the various technologies.

00:16:48.150 --> 00:16:52.150
And it's nice to have the science, but it still depends mostly upon the people,

00:16:52.150 --> 00:16:54.150
on your education.

00:16:54.150 --> 00:16:56.150
We have our farmer schools.

00:16:56.150 --> 00:16:58.150
But the real success of course, is our band --

00:16:58.150 --> 00:17:02.150
because if a baby is born, we will play, so everyone's our family

00:17:02.150 --> 00:17:04.150
and you don't make trouble with your family.

00:17:04.150 --> 00:17:06.150
This is how it looks.

00:17:06.150 --> 00:17:08.150
We have this road going around the area,

00:17:08.150 --> 00:17:12.150
which brings the people electricity and water from our own area.

00:17:12.150 --> 00:17:14.150
We have the zone with the sugar palms,

00:17:14.150 --> 00:17:16.150
and then we have this fence with very thorny palms

00:17:16.150 --> 00:17:21.150
to keep the orangutans -- that we provide with a place to live in the middle --

00:17:21.150 --> 00:17:23.150
and the people apart.

00:17:23.150 --> 00:17:25.150
And inside, we have this area for reforestation

00:17:25.150 --> 00:17:28.150
as a gene bank to keep all that material alive,

00:17:28.150 --> 00:17:30.150
because for the last 12 years

00:17:30.150 --> 00:17:34.150
not a single seedling of the tropical hardwood trees has grown up

00:17:34.150 --> 00:17:37.150
because the climatic triggers have disappeared.

00:17:37.150 --> 00:17:39.150
All the seeds get eaten.

00:17:39.150 --> 00:17:41.150
So now we do the monitoring on the inside --

00:17:41.150 --> 00:17:44.150
from towers, satellites, ultralights.

00:17:44.150 --> 00:17:48.150
Each of the families that have sold their land now get a piece of land back.

00:17:48.150 --> 00:17:52.150
And it has two nice fences of tropical hardwood trees --

00:17:52.150 --> 00:17:54.150
you have the shade trees planted in year one,

00:17:54.150 --> 00:17:56.150
then you underplanted with the sugar palms,

00:17:57.150 --> 00:17:59.150
and you plant this thorny fence.

00:17:59.150 --> 00:18:03.150
And after a few years, you can remove some of those shade trees.

00:18:03.150 --> 00:18:07.150
The people get that acacia timber which we have preserved with the bamboo peel,

00:18:07.150 --> 00:18:10.150
and they can build a house, they have some fuel wood to cook with.

00:18:10.150 --> 00:18:14.150
And they can start producing from the trees as many as they like.

00:18:14.150 --> 00:18:18.150
They have enough income for three families.

00:18:18.150 --> 00:18:22.150
But whatever you do in that program, it has to be fully supported by the people,

00:18:22.150 --> 00:18:26.150
meaning that you also have to adjust it to the local, cultural values.

00:18:26.150 --> 00:18:30.150
There is no simple one recipe for one place.

00:18:30.150 --> 00:18:34.150
You also have to make sure that it is very difficult to corrupt --

00:18:34.150 --> 00:18:36.150
that it's transparent.

00:18:36.150 --> 00:18:38.150
Like here, in Samboja Lestari,

00:18:38.150 --> 00:18:41.150
we divide that ring in groups of 20 families.

00:18:41.150 --> 00:18:43.150
If one member trespasses the agreement,

00:18:43.150 --> 00:18:45.150
and does cut down trees,

00:18:45.150 --> 00:18:48.150
the other 19 members have to decide what's going to happen to him.

00:18:48.150 --> 00:18:50.150
If the group doesn't take action,

00:18:50.150 --> 00:18:54.150
the other 33 groups have to decide what is going to happen to the group

00:18:54.150 --> 00:18:58.150
that doesn't comply with those great deals that we are offering them.

00:18:58.150 --> 00:19:01.150
In North Sulawesi it is the cooperative --

00:19:01.150 --> 00:19:03.150
they have a democratic culture there,

00:19:03.150 --> 00:19:08.150
so there you can use the local justice system to protect your system.

00:19:08.150 --> 00:19:11.150
In summary, if you look at it, in year one the people can sell their land

00:19:11.150 --> 00:19:16.150
to get income, but they get jobs back in the construction and the reforestation,

00:19:16.150 --> 00:19:20.150
the working with the orangutans, and they can use the waste wood to make handicraft.

00:19:20.150 --> 00:19:23.150
They also get free land in between the trees,

00:19:23.150 --> 00:19:25.150
where they can grow their crops.

00:19:25.150 --> 00:19:29.150
They can now sell part of those fruits to the orangutan project.

00:19:29.150 --> 00:19:31.150
They get building material for houses,

00:19:31.150 --> 00:19:33.150
a contract for selling the sugar,

00:19:33.150 --> 00:19:37.150
so we can produce huge amounts of ethanol and energy locally.

00:19:37.150 --> 00:19:40.150
They get all these other benefits: environmentally, money,

00:19:40.150 --> 00:19:42.150
they get education -- it's a great deal.

00:19:42.150 --> 00:19:45.150
And everything is based upon that one thing --

00:19:45.150 --> 00:19:48.150
make sure that forest remains there.

00:19:48.150 --> 00:19:51.150
So if we want to help the orangutans --

00:19:51.150 --> 00:19:54.150
what I actually set out to do --

00:19:54.150 --> 00:19:58.150
we must make sure that the local people are the ones that benefit.

00:19:58.150 --> 00:20:02.150
Now I think the real key to doing it, to give a simple answer,

00:20:02.150 --> 00:20:04.150
is integration.

00:20:04.150 --> 00:20:08.150
I hope -- if you want to know more, you can read more.

00:20:08.150 --> 00:20:29.150
