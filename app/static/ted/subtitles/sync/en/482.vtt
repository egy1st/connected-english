00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.150
I was speaking to a group of about 300 kids,

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:17.150
ages six to eight, at a children's museum,

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:21.150
and I brought with me a bag full of legs,

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.150
similar to the kinds of things you see up here,

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:25.150
and had them laid out on a table for the kids.

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:29.150
And, from my experience, you know, kids are naturally curious

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:31.150
about what they don't know, or don't understand,

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:33.150
or is foreign to them.

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:35.150
They only learn to be frightened of those differences

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:38.150
when an adult influences them to behave that way,

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:41.150
and maybe censors that natural curiosity,

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:44.150
or you know, reins in the question-asking

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:46.150
in the hopes of them being polite little kids.

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:50.150
So I just pictured a first grade teacher out in the lobby

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:53.150
with these unruly kids, saying, "Now, whatever you do,

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:55.150
don't stare at her legs."

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:57.150
But, of course, that's the point.

00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:00.150
That's why I was there, I wanted to invite them to look and explore.

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:04.150
So I made a deal with the adults

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:07.150
that the kids could come in without any adults for two minutes

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:09.150
on their own.

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:13.150
The doors open, the kids descend on this table of legs,

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:16.150
and they are poking and prodding, and they're wiggling toes,

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:18.150
and they're trying to put their full weight on the sprinting leg

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.150
to see what happens with that.

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:22.150
And I said, "Kids, really quickly --

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:26.150
I woke up this morning, I decided I wanted to be able to jump over a house --

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:28.150
nothing too big, two or three stories --

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:33.150
but, if you could think of any animal, any superhero, any cartoon character,

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.150
anything you can dream up right now,

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:37.150
what kind of legs would you build me?"

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:40.150
And immediately a voice shouted, "Kangaroo!"

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:42.150
"No, no, no! Should be a frog!"

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.150
"No. It should be Go Go Gadget!"

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:46.150
"No, no, no! It should be the Incredibles."

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:49.150
And other things that I don't -- aren't familiar with.

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:51.150
And then, one eight-year-old said,

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:55.150
"Hey, why wouldn't you want to fly too?"

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:59.150
And the whole room, including me, was like, "Yeah."

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:01.150
(Laughter)

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:04.150
And just like that, I went from being a woman

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:08.150
that these kids would have been trained to see as "disabled"

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:13.150
to somebody that had potential that their bodies didn't have yet.

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:15.150
Somebody that might even be super-abled.

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:17.150
Interesting.

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:22.150
So some of you actually saw me at TED, 11 years ago.

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:26.150
And there's been a lot of talk about how life-changing this conference is

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:30.150
for both speakers and attendees, and I am no exception.

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:36.150
TED literally was the launch pad to the next decade of my life's exploration.

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:41.150
At the time, the legs I presented were groundbreaking in prosthetics.

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:43.150
I had woven carbon fiber sprinting legs

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:45.150
modeled after the hind leg of a cheetah,

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:47.150
which you may have seen on stage yesterday.

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:53.150
And also these very life-like, intrinsically painted silicone legs.

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:57.150
So at the time, it was my opportunity to put a call out

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:01.150
to innovators outside the traditional medical prosthetic community

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:05.150
to come bring their talent to the science and to the art

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:07.150
of building legs.

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:12.150
So that we can stop compartmentalizing form, function and aesthetic,

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:14.150
and assigning them different values.

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:18.150
Well, lucky for me, a lot of people answered that call.

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:23.150
And the journey started, funny enough, with a TED conference attendee --

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:26.150
Chee Pearlman, who hopefully is in the audience somewhere today.

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:29.150
She was the editor then of a magazine called ID,

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:32.150
and she gave me a cover story.

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:35.150
This started an incredible journey.

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:37.150
Curious encounters were happening to me at the time;

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:40.150
I'd been accepting numerous invitations to speak

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:43.150
on the design of the cheetah legs around the world.

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:46.150
And people would come up to me after the conference, after my talk,

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:48.150
men and women.

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:50.150
And the conversation would go something like this,

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:54.150
"You know Aimee, you're very attractive.

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:56.150
You don't look disabled."

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:57.150
(Laughter)

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:59.150
I thought, "Well, that's amazing,

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:01.150
because I don't feel disabled."

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:06.150
And it really opened my eyes to this conversation

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:08.150
that could be explored, about beauty.

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:11.150
What does a beautiful woman have to look like?

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:13.150
What is a sexy body?

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:15.150
And interestingly, from an identity standpoint,

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:18.150
what does it mean to have a disability?

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:21.150
I mean, people -- Pamela Anderson has more prosthetic in her body than I do.

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:23.150
Nobody calls her disabled.

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:28.150
(Laughter)

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:33.150
So this magazine, through the hands of graphic designer Peter Saville,

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:38.150
went to fashion designer Alexander McQueen, and photographer Nick Knight,

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:40.150
who were also interested in exploring that conversation.

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:43.150
So, three months after TED I found myself on a plane

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:48.150
to London, doing my first fashion shoot,

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:49.150
which resulted in this cover --

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:52.150
"Fashion-able"?

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:56.150
Three months after that, I did my first runway show for Alexander McQueen

00:04:56.150 --> 00:05:01.150
on a pair of hand-carved wooden legs made from solid ash.

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:04.150
Nobody knew -- everyone thought they were wooden boots.

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:06.150
Actually, I have them on stage with me:

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:11.150
grapevines, magnolias -- truly stunning.

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:15.150
Poetry matters.

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:20.150
Poetry is what elevates the banal and neglected object

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:22.150
to a realm of art.

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:28.150
It can transform the thing that might have made people fearful

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:30.150
into something that invites them to look,

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:33.150
and look a little longer,

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:35.150
and maybe even understand.

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:39.150
I learned this firsthand with my next adventure.

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:43.150
The artist Matthew Barney, in his film opus called the "The Cremaster Cycle."

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:46.150
This is where it really hit home for me --

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:48.150
that my legs could be wearable sculpture.

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:55.150
And even at this point, I started to move away from the need to replicate human-ness

00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:57.150
as the only aesthetic ideal.

00:05:57.150 --> 00:06:01.150
So we made what people lovingly referred to as glass legs

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:05.150
even though they're actually optically clear polyurethane,

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:07.150
a.k.a. bowling ball material.

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:08.150
Heavy!

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:10.150
Then we made these legs that are cast in soil

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:14.150
with a potato root system growing in them, and beetroots out the top,

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:16.150
and a very lovely brass toe.

00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:18.150
That's a good close-up of that one.

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:20.150
Then another character was a half-woman, half-cheetah --

00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:22.150
a little homage to my life as an athlete.

00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:25.150
14 hours of prosthetic make-up

00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:29.150
to get into a creature that had articulated paws,

00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:33.150
claws and a tail that whipped around,

00:06:33.150 --> 00:06:35.150
like a gecko.

00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:36.150
(Laughter)

00:06:37.150 --> 00:06:41.150
And then another pair of legs we collaborated on were these --

00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:43.150
look like jellyfish legs,

00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:45.150
also polyurethane.

00:06:45.150 --> 00:06:48.150
And the only purpose that these legs can serve,

00:06:48.150 --> 00:06:51.150
outside the context of the film,

00:06:51.150 --> 00:06:54.150
is to provoke the senses and ignite the imagination.

00:06:54.150 --> 00:06:57.150
So whimsy matters.

00:06:57.150 --> 00:07:03.150
Today, I have over a dozen pair of prosthetic legs

00:07:03.150 --> 00:07:05.150
that various people have made for me,

00:07:05.150 --> 00:07:09.150
and with them I have different negotiations of the terrain under my feet,

00:07:09.150 --> 00:07:11.150
and I can change my height --

00:07:11.150 --> 00:07:13.150
I have a variable of five different heights.

00:07:13.150 --> 00:07:15.150
(Laughter)

00:07:15.150 --> 00:07:17.150
Today, I'm 6'1".

00:07:17.150 --> 00:07:20.150
And I had these legs made a little over a year ago

00:07:20.150 --> 00:07:22.150
at Dorset Orthopedic in England

00:07:22.150 --> 00:07:24.150
and when I brought them home to Manhattan,

00:07:24.150 --> 00:07:26.150
my first night out on the town, I went to a very fancy party.

00:07:26.150 --> 00:07:29.150
And a girl was there who has known me for years

00:07:29.150 --> 00:07:31.150
at my normal 5'8".

00:07:31.150 --> 00:07:33.150
Her mouth dropped open when she saw me,

00:07:33.150 --> 00:07:36.150
and she went, "But you're so tall!"

00:07:36.150 --> 00:07:38.150
And I said, "I know. Isn't it fun?"

00:07:38.150 --> 00:07:40.150
I mean, it's a little bit like wearing stilts on stilts,

00:07:40.150 --> 00:07:43.150
but I have an entirely new relationship to door jams

00:07:43.150 --> 00:07:45.150
that I never expected I would ever have.

00:07:45.150 --> 00:07:48.150
And I was having fun with it.

00:07:48.150 --> 00:07:50.150
And she looked at me,

00:07:50.150 --> 00:07:52.150
and she said, "But, Aimee, that's not fair."

00:07:52.150 --> 00:07:55.150
(Laughter)

00:07:55.150 --> 00:07:57.150
(Applause)

00:07:57.150 --> 00:08:01.150
And the incredible thing was she really meant it.

00:08:01.150 --> 00:08:03.150
It's not fair that you can change your height,

00:08:03.150 --> 00:08:05.150
as you want it.

00:08:05.150 --> 00:08:07.150
And that's when I knew --

00:08:07.150 --> 00:08:10.150
that's when I knew that the conversation with society

00:08:10.150 --> 00:08:12.150
has changed profoundly

00:08:12.150 --> 00:08:14.150
in this last decade.

00:08:14.150 --> 00:08:19.150
It is no longer a conversation about overcoming deficiency.

00:08:19.150 --> 00:08:21.150
It's a conversation about augmentation.

00:08:21.150 --> 00:08:25.150
It's a conversation about potential.

00:08:25.150 --> 00:08:30.150
A prosthetic limb doesn't represent the need to replace loss anymore.

00:08:30.150 --> 00:08:33.150
It can stand as a symbol that the wearer

00:08:33.150 --> 00:08:36.150
has the power to create whatever it is that they want to create

00:08:36.150 --> 00:08:38.150
in that space.

00:08:38.150 --> 00:08:41.150
So people that society once considered to be disabled

00:08:41.150 --> 00:08:46.150
can now become the architects of their own identities

00:08:46.150 --> 00:08:48.150
and indeed continue to change those identities

00:08:48.150 --> 00:08:50.150
by designing their bodies

00:08:50.150 --> 00:08:53.150
from a place of empowerment.

00:08:53.150 --> 00:08:58.150
And what is exciting to me so much right now

00:08:58.150 --> 00:09:02.150
is that by combining cutting-edge technology --

00:09:02.150 --> 00:09:04.150
robotics, bionics --

00:09:04.150 --> 00:09:06.150
with the age-old poetry,

00:09:06.150 --> 00:09:12.150
we are moving closer to understanding our collective humanity.

00:09:12.150 --> 00:09:17.150
I think that if we want to discover the full potential

00:09:17.150 --> 00:09:19.150
in our humanity,

00:09:19.150 --> 00:09:23.150
we need to celebrate those heartbreaking strengths

00:09:23.150 --> 00:09:26.150
and those glorious disabilities that we all have.

00:09:26.150 --> 00:09:29.150
I think of Shakespeare's Shylock:

00:09:29.150 --> 00:09:33.150
"If you prick us, do we not bleed,

00:09:33.150 --> 00:09:36.150
and if you tickle us, do we not laugh?"

00:09:36.150 --> 00:09:39.150
It is our humanity,

00:09:39.150 --> 00:09:41.150
and all the potential within it,

00:09:41.150 --> 00:09:44.150
that makes us beautiful.

00:09:44.150 --> 00:09:45.150
Thank you.

00:09:45.150 --> 00:09:52.150
(Applause)
