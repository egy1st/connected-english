00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:17.150
If you're at all like me,

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:20.150
this is what you do with the sunny summer weekends in San Francisco:

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:23.150
you build experimental kite-powered hydrofoils

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:25.150
capable of more than 30 knots.

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:28.150
And you realize that there is incredible power in the wind,

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:30.150
and it can do amazing things.

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.150
And one day, a vessel not unlike this

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:34.150
will probably break the world speed record.

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:37.150
But kites aren't just toys like this.

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:39.150
Kites: I'm going to give you a brief history,

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:41.150
and tell you about the magnificent future

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:44.150
of every child's favorite plaything.

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:46.150
So, kites are more than a thousand years old,

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:49.150
and the Chinese used them for military applications,

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:50.150
and even for lifting men.

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:53.150
So they knew at that stage they could carry large weights.

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:55.150
I'm not sure why there is a hole in this particular man.

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:57.150
(Laughter)

00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:00.150
In 1827, a fellow called George Pocock

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:03.150
actually pioneered the use of kites for towing buggies

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:08.150
in races against horse carriages across the English countryside.

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:10.150
Then of course, at the dawn of aviation,

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:12.150
all of the great inventors of the time --

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.150
like Hargreaves, like Langley,

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:17.150
even Alexander Graham Bell, inventor of the telephone, who was flying this kite --

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:20.150
were doing so in the pursuit of aviation.

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:22.150
Then these two fellows came along,

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:25.150
and they were flying kites to develop the control systems

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:28.150
that would ultimately enable powered human flight.

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:31.150
So this is of course Orville and Wilbur Wright,

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:33.150
and the Wright Flyer.

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.150
And their experiments with kites led to this

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:38.150
momentous occasion, where we powered up and took off for the

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:42.150
first-ever 12-second human flight.

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:46.150
And that was fantastic for the future of commercial aviation.

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:50.150
But unfortunately, it relegated kites once again to be considered children's toys.

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:54.150
That was until the 1970s, where we had the last energy crisis.

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:56.150
And a fabulous man called Miles Loyd

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:58.150
who lives on the outskirts of San Francisco,

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:01.150
wrote this seminal paper that was completely ignored

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:02.150
in the Journal of Energy

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:06.150
about how to use basically an airplane on a piece of string

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:09.150
to generate enormous amounts of electricity.

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:11.150
The real key observation he made is that

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:15.150
a free-flying wing can sweep through more sky and generate more power

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:19.150
in a unit of time than a fixed-wing turbine.

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:23.150
So turbines grew. And they can now span up to three hundred feet at the hub height,

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:25.150
but they can't really go a lot higher,

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:28.150
and more height is where the more wind is, and more power --

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:30.150
as much as twice as much.

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:33.150
So cut to now. We still have an energy crisis,

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:36.150
and now we have a climate crisis as well. You know,

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:39.150
so humans generate about 12 trillion watts,

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:41.150
or 12 terawatts, from fossil fuels.

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:45.150
And Al Gore has spoken to why we need to hit one of these targets,

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:49.150
and in reality what that means is in the next 30 to 40 years,

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:55.150
we have to make 10 trillion watts or more of new clean energy somehow.

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:59.150
Wind is the second-largest renewable resource after solar:

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:03.150
3600 terawatts, more than enough to supply humanity 200 times over.

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:07.150
The majority of it is in the higher altitudes, above 300 feet,

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:11.150
where we don't have a technology as yet to get there.

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:13.150
So this is the dawn of the new age of kites.

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:17.150
This is our test site on Maui, flying across the sky.

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:19.150
I'm now going to show you

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:22.150
the first autonomous generation of power

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:25.150
by every child's favorite plaything.

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:29.150
As you can tell, you need to be a robot to fly this thing for thousands of hours.

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:31.150
It makes you a little nauseous.

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:33.150
And here we're actually generating about 10 kilowatts --

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:36.150
so, enough to power probably five United States households --

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:39.150
with a kite not much larger than this piano.

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:41.150
And the real significant thing here

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:43.150
is we're developing the control systems,

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:48.150
as did the Wright brothers, that would enable sustained, long-duration flight.

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:53.150
And it doesn't hurt to do it in a location like this either.

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:56.150
So this is the equivalent for a kite flier of peeing in the snow --

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:58.150
that's tracing your name in the sky.

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:00.150
And this is where we're actually going.

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:02.150
So we're beyond the 12-second steps.

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:04.150
And we're working towards megawatt-scale machines

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:08.150
that fly at 2000 feet and generate tons of clean electricity.

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:10.150
So you ask, how big are those machines?

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:13.150
Well, this paper plane would be maybe a -- oop!

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:16.150
That would be enough to power your cell phone.

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:19.150
Your Cessna would be 230 killowatts.

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:23.150
If you'd loan me your Gulfstream, I'll rip its wings off and generate you a megawatt.

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:26.150
If you give me a 747, I'll make six megawatts,

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:29.150
which is more than the largest wind turbines today.

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:32.150
And the Spruce Goose would be a 15-megawatt wing.

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:35.150
So that is audacious, you say. I agree.

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:38.150
But audacious is what has happened many times before in history.

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:40.150
This is a refrigerator factory,

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:43.150
churning out airplanes for World War II.

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:46.150
Prior to World War II, they were making 1000 planes a year.

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:49.150
By 1945, they were making 100,000.

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:51.150
With this factory and 100,000 planes a year,

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:55.150
we could make all of America's electricity in about 10 years.

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:58.150
So really this is a story about the audacious plans of young people

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:00.150
with these dreams. There are many of us.

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:02.150
I am lucky enough to work with 30 of them.

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:04.150
And I think we need to support all of the dreams

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:07.150
of the kids out there doing these crazy things.

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:08.150
Thank you.

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:13.150
(Applause)
