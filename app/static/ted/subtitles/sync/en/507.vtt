00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.150
What I'm going to try to do is explain to you

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:17.150
quickly how to predict,

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:19.150
and illustrate it with some predictions

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:24.150
about what Iran is going to do in the next couple of years.

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.150
In order to predict effectively,

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.150
we need to use science.

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:33.150
And the reason that we need to use science

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:35.150
is because then we can reproduce what we're doing;

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:38.150
it's not just wisdom or guesswork.

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:41.150
And if we can predict,

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:43.150
then we can engineer the future.

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:47.150
So if you are concerned to influence energy policy,

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:52.150
or you are concerned to influence national security policy,

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:55.150
or health policy, or education,

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:59.150
science -- and a particular branch of science -- is a way to do it,

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:01.150
not the way we've been doing it,

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:03.150
which is seat-of-the-pants wisdom.

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:05.150
Now before I get into how to do it

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:08.150
let me give you a little truth in advertising,

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:11.150
because I'm not engaged in the business of magic.

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:15.150
There are lots of thing that the approach I take can predict,

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.150
and there are some that it can't.

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:20.150
It can predict complex negotiations

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:23.150
or situations involving coercion --

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:27.150
that is in essence everything that has to do with politics,

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.150
much of what has to do with business,

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:35.150
but sorry, if you're looking to speculate in the stock market,

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:37.150
I don't predict stock markets -- OK,

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:40.150
it's not going up any time really soon.

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:43.150
But I'm not engaged in doing that.

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:46.150
I'm not engaged in predicting random number generators.

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:48.150
I actually get phone calls from people

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:51.150
who want to know what lottery numbers are going to win.

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:54.150
I don't have a clue.

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:58.150
I engage in the use of game theory, game theory is a branch of mathematics

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:02.150
and that means, sorry, that even in the study of politics,

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:05.150
math has come into the picture.

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:09.150
We can no longer pretend that we just speculate about politics,

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:12.150
we need to look at this in a rigorous way.

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:15.150
Now, what is game theory about?

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:20.150
It assumes that people are looking out for what's good for them.

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:22.150
That doesn't seem terribly shocking --

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:24.150
although it's controversial for a lot of people --

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:28.150
that we are self-interested.

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:30.150
In order to look out for what's best for them

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:32.150
or what they think is best for them,

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:36.150
people have values -- they identify what they want, and what they don't want.

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:39.150
And they have beliefs about what other people want,

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:42.150
and what other people don't want, how much power other people have,

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:46.150
how much those people could get in the way of whatever it is that you want.

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:50.150
And they face limitations, constraints,

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:53.150
they may be weak, they may be located in the wrong part of the world,

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:56.150
they may be Einstein, stuck away farming

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:00.150
someplace in a rural village in India not being noticed,

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:03.150
as was the case for Ramanujan for a long time,

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:06.150
a great mathematician but nobody noticed.

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:08.150
Now who is rational?

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:11.150
A lot of people are worried about what is rationality about?

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:13.150
You know, what if people are rational?

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:16.150
Mother Theresa, she was rational.

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:20.150
Terrorists, they're rational.

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:23.150
Pretty much everybody is rational.

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:26.150
I think there are only two exceptions that I'm aware of --

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:28.150
two-year-olds, they are not rational,

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:31.150
they have very fickle preferences,

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:33.150
they switch what they think all the time,

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:36.150
and schizophrenics are probably not rational,

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:38.150
but pretty much everybody else is rational.

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:40.150
That is, they are just trying to do

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:45.150
what they think is in their own best interest.

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:47.150
Now in order to work out what people are going to do

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:49.150
to pursue their interests,

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:51.150
we have to think about who has influence in the world.

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:56.150
If you're trying to influence corporations to change their behavior,

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:59.150
with regard to producing pollutants,

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:01.150
one approach, the common approach,

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:03.150
is to exhort them to be better,

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:06.150
to explain to them what damage they're doing to the planet.

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:08.150
And many of you may have noticed that doesn't have

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:12.150
as big an effect, as perhaps you would like it to have.

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:15.150
But if you show them that it's in their interest,

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:17.150
then they're responsive.

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:20.150
So, we have to work out who influences problems.

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:22.150
If we're looking at Iran, the president of the United States

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:25.150
we would like to think, may have some influence --

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:29.150
certainly the president in Iran has some influence --

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:32.150
but we make a mistake if we just pay attention

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:35.150
to the person at the top of the power ladder

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:38.150
because that person doesn't know much about Iran,

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:40.150
or about energy policy,

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:42.150
or about health care,

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:44.150
or about any particular policy.

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:49.150
That person surrounds himself or herself with advisers.

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:51.150
If we're talking about national security problems,

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:53.150
maybe it's the Secretary of State,

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:55.150
maybe it's the Secretary of Defense,

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:57.150
the Director of National Intelligence,

00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:59.150
maybe the ambassador to the United Nations, or somebody else

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:03.150
who they think is going to know more about the particular problem.

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:06.150
But let's face it, the Secretary of State doesn't know much about Iran.

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:09.150
The secretary of defense doesn't know much about Iran.

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:12.150
Each of those people in turn

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:14.150
has advisers who advise them,

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:17.150
so they can advise the president.

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:20.150
There are lots of people shaping decisions

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:22.150
and so if we want to predict correctly

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:25.150
we have to pay attention to everybody

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:27.150
who is trying to shape the outcome,

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:30.150
not just the people at the pinnacle

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:34.150
of the decision-making pyramid.

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:36.150
Unfortunately, a lot of times we don't do that.

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:38.150
There's a good reason that we don't do that,

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:41.150
and there's a good reason that using game theory and computers,

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:44.150
we can overcome the limitation

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:46.150
of just looking at a few people.

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:50.150
Imagine a problem with just five decision-makers.

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:52.150
Imagine for example

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:54.150
that Sally over here,

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:57.150
wants to know what Harry, and Jane,

00:05:57.150 --> 00:06:00.150
and George and Frank are thinking,

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:02.150
and sends messages to those people.

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:04.150
Sally's giving her opinion to them,

00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:07.150
and they're giving their opinion to Sally.

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:09.150
But Sally also wants to know

00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:12.150
what Harry is saying to these three,

00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:14.150
and what they're saying to Harry.

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:16.150
And Harry wants to know

00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:19.150
what each of those people are saying to each other, and so on,

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:22.150
and Sally would like to know what Harry thinks those people are saying.

00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:25.150
That's a complicated problem; that's a lot to know.

00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:28.150
With five decision-makers

00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:30.150
there are a lot of linkages --

00:06:30.150 --> 00:06:32.150
120, as a matter of fact,

00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:34.150
if you remember your factorials.

00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:36.150
Five factorial is 120.

00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:38.150
Now you may be surprised to know

00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:41.150
that smart people can keep 120 things straight

00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:43.150
in their head.

00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:45.150
Suppose we double the number of influencers

00:06:45.150 --> 00:06:47.150
from five to 10.

00:06:47.150 --> 00:06:51.150
Does that mean we've doubled the number of pieces of information

00:06:51.150 --> 00:06:53.150
we need to know, from 120 to 240?

00:06:53.150 --> 00:06:55.150
No. How about 10 times?

00:06:55.150 --> 00:06:58.150
To 1,200? No.

00:06:58.150 --> 00:07:01.150
We've increased it to 3.6 million.

00:07:01.150 --> 00:07:03.150
Nobody can keep that straight in their head.

00:07:03.150 --> 00:07:06.150
But computers,

00:07:06.150 --> 00:07:09.150
they can. They don't need coffee breaks,

00:07:09.150 --> 00:07:12.150
they don't need vacations,

00:07:12.150 --> 00:07:14.150
they don't need to go to sleep at night,

00:07:14.150 --> 00:07:17.150
they don't ask for raises either.

00:07:17.150 --> 00:07:19.150
They can keep this information straight

00:07:19.150 --> 00:07:22.150
and that means that we can process the information.

00:07:22.150 --> 00:07:24.150
So I'm going to talk to you about how to process it,

00:07:24.150 --> 00:07:27.150
and I'm going to give you some examples out of Iran,

00:07:27.150 --> 00:07:29.150
and you're going to be wondering,

00:07:29.150 --> 00:07:31.150
"Why should we listen to this guy?

00:07:31.150 --> 00:07:34.150
Why should we believe what he's saying?"

00:07:34.150 --> 00:07:38.150
So I'm going to show you a factoid.

00:07:38.150 --> 00:07:41.150
This is an assessment by the Central Intelligence Agency

00:07:41.150 --> 00:07:43.150
of the percentage of time

00:07:43.150 --> 00:07:45.150
that the model I'm talking about

00:07:45.150 --> 00:07:48.150
is right in predicting things whose outcome is not yet known,

00:07:48.150 --> 00:07:52.150
when the experts who provided the data inputs

00:07:52.150 --> 00:07:54.150
got it wrong.

00:07:54.150 --> 00:07:57.150
That's not my claim, that's a CIA claim -- you can read it,

00:07:57.150 --> 00:08:00.150
it was declassified a while ago. You can read it in a volume edited by

00:08:00.150 --> 00:08:03.150
H. Bradford Westerfield, Yale University Press.

00:08:03.150 --> 00:08:05.150
So, what do we need to know

00:08:05.150 --> 00:08:07.150
in order to predict?

00:08:07.150 --> 00:08:10.150
You may be surprised to find out we don't need to know very much.

00:08:10.150 --> 00:08:13.150
We do need to know who has a stake

00:08:13.150 --> 00:08:18.150
in trying to shape the outcome of a decision.

00:08:18.150 --> 00:08:21.150
We need to know what they say they want,

00:08:21.150 --> 00:08:24.150
not what they want in their heart of hearts,

00:08:24.150 --> 00:08:26.150
not what they think they can get,

00:08:26.150 --> 00:08:29.150
but what they say they want, because that is a strategically chosen position,

00:08:29.150 --> 00:08:31.150
and we can work backwards from that

00:08:31.150 --> 00:08:35.150
to draw inferences about important features of their decision-making.

00:08:35.150 --> 00:08:37.150
We need to know how focused they are

00:08:37.150 --> 00:08:39.150
on the problem at hand.

00:08:39.150 --> 00:08:42.150
That is, how willing are they to drop what they're doing when the issue comes up,

00:08:42.150 --> 00:08:46.150
and attend to it instead of something else that's on their plate --

00:08:46.150 --> 00:08:48.150
how big a deal is it to them?

00:08:48.150 --> 00:08:51.150
And how much clout could they bring to bear

00:08:51.150 --> 00:08:56.150
if they chose to engage on the issue?

00:08:56.150 --> 00:08:58.150
If we know those things

00:08:58.150 --> 00:09:01.150
we can predict their behavior by assuming that everybody

00:09:01.150 --> 00:09:06.150
cares about two things on any decision.

00:09:06.150 --> 00:09:08.150
They care about the outcome. They'd like an outcome as close to

00:09:08.150 --> 00:09:11.150
what they are interested in as possible.

00:09:11.150 --> 00:09:14.150
They're careerists, they also care about getting credit --

00:09:14.150 --> 00:09:16.150
there's ego involvement,

00:09:16.150 --> 00:09:20.150
they want to be seen as important in shaping the outcome,

00:09:20.150 --> 00:09:25.150
or as important, if it's their druthers, to block an outcome.

00:09:25.150 --> 00:09:28.150
And so we have to figure out how they balance those two things.

00:09:28.150 --> 00:09:30.150
Different people trade off

00:09:30.150 --> 00:09:33.150
between standing by their outcome,

00:09:33.150 --> 00:09:36.150
faithfully holding to it, going down in a blaze of glory,

00:09:36.150 --> 00:09:39.150
or giving it up, putting their finger in the wind,

00:09:39.150 --> 00:09:42.150
and doing whatever they think is going to be a winning position.

00:09:42.150 --> 00:09:45.150
Most people fall in between, and if we can work out where they fall

00:09:45.150 --> 00:09:47.150
we can work out how to negotiate with them

00:09:47.150 --> 00:09:49.150
to change their behavior.

00:09:49.150 --> 00:09:52.150
So with just that little bit of input

00:09:52.150 --> 00:09:55.150
we can work out what the choices are that people have,

00:09:55.150 --> 00:09:58.150
what the chances are that they're willing to take,

00:09:58.150 --> 00:10:01.150
what they're after, what they value, what they want,

00:10:01.150 --> 00:10:04.150
and what they believe about other people.

00:10:04.150 --> 00:10:08.150
You might notice what we don't need to know:

00:10:08.150 --> 00:10:10.150
there's no history in here.

00:10:10.150 --> 00:10:12.150
How they got to where they are

00:10:12.150 --> 00:10:14.150
may be important in shaping the input information,

00:10:14.150 --> 00:10:16.150
but once we know where they are

00:10:16.150 --> 00:10:19.150
we're worried about where they're going to be headed in the future.

00:10:19.150 --> 00:10:23.150
How they got there turns out not to be terribly critical in predicting.

00:10:23.150 --> 00:10:27.150
I remind you of that 90 percent accuracy rate.

00:10:27.150 --> 00:10:29.150
So where are we going to get this information?

00:10:29.150 --> 00:10:32.150
We can get this information

00:10:32.150 --> 00:10:35.150
from the Internet, from The Economist,

00:10:35.150 --> 00:10:38.150
The Financial Times, The New York Times,

00:10:38.150 --> 00:10:41.150
U.S. News and World Report, lots of sources like that,

00:10:41.150 --> 00:10:43.150
or we can get it from asking experts

00:10:43.150 --> 00:10:46.150
who spend their lives studying places and problems,

00:10:46.150 --> 00:10:49.150
because those experts know this information.

00:10:49.150 --> 00:10:52.150
If they don't know, who are the people trying to influence the decision,

00:10:52.150 --> 00:10:54.150
how much clout do they have,

00:10:54.150 --> 00:10:57.150
how much they care about this issue, and what do they say they want,

00:10:57.150 --> 00:11:00.150
are they experts? That's what it means to be an expert,

00:11:00.150 --> 00:11:04.150
that's the basic stuff an expert needs to know.

00:11:04.150 --> 00:11:06.150
Alright, lets turn to Iran.

00:11:06.150 --> 00:11:09.150
Let me make three important predictions --

00:11:09.150 --> 00:11:12.150
you can check this out, time will tell.

00:11:12.150 --> 00:11:20.150
What is Iran going to do about its nuclear weapons program?

00:11:20.150 --> 00:11:23.150
How secure is the theocratic regime in Iran?

00:11:23.150 --> 00:11:25.150
What's its future?

00:11:25.150 --> 00:11:28.150
And everybody's best friend,

00:11:28.150 --> 00:11:31.150
Ahmadinejad. How are things going for him?

00:11:31.150 --> 00:11:37.150
How are things going to be working out for him in the next year or two?

00:11:37.150 --> 00:11:40.150
You take a look at this, this is not based on statistics.

00:11:40.150 --> 00:11:45.150
I want to be very clear here. I'm not projecting some past data into the future.

00:11:45.150 --> 00:11:48.150
I've taken inputs on positions and so forth,

00:11:48.150 --> 00:11:50.150
run it through a computer model

00:11:50.150 --> 00:11:53.150
that had simulated the dynamics of interaction,

00:11:53.150 --> 00:11:55.150
and these are the simulated dynamics,

00:11:55.150 --> 00:11:58.150
the predictions about the path of policy.

00:11:58.150 --> 00:12:01.150
So you can see here on the vertical axis,

00:12:01.150 --> 00:12:03.150
I haven't shown it all the way down to zero,

00:12:03.150 --> 00:12:06.150
there are lots of other options, but here I'm just showing you the prediction,

00:12:06.150 --> 00:12:08.150
so I've narrowed the scale.

00:12:08.150 --> 00:12:11.150
Up at the top of the axis, "Build the Bomb."

00:12:11.150 --> 00:12:15.150
At 130, we start somewhere above 130,

00:12:15.150 --> 00:12:18.150
between building a bomb, and making enough weapons-grade fuel

00:12:18.150 --> 00:12:20.150
so that you could build a bomb.

00:12:20.150 --> 00:12:23.150
That's where, according to my analyses,

00:12:23.150 --> 00:12:26.150
the Iranians were at the beginning of this year.

00:12:26.150 --> 00:12:29.150
And then the model makes predictions down the road.

00:12:29.150 --> 00:12:33.150
At 115 they would only produce enough weapons grade fuel

00:12:33.150 --> 00:12:35.150
to show that they know how, but they wouldn't build a weapon:

00:12:35.150 --> 00:12:37.150
they would build a research quantity.

00:12:37.150 --> 00:12:39.150
It would achieve some national pride,

00:12:39.150 --> 00:12:42.150
but not go ahead and build a weapon.

00:12:42.150 --> 00:12:44.150
And down at 100 they would build civilian nuclear energy,

00:12:44.150 --> 00:12:48.150
which is what they say is their objective.

00:12:48.150 --> 00:12:51.150
The yellow line shows us the most likely path.

00:12:51.150 --> 00:12:52.150
The yellow line includes an analysis

00:12:52.150 --> 00:12:55.150
of 87 decision makers in Iran,

00:12:55.150 --> 00:12:58.150
and a vast number of outside influencers

00:12:58.150 --> 00:13:01.150
trying to pressure Iran into changing its behavior,

00:13:01.150 --> 00:13:04.150
various players in the United States, and Egypt,

00:13:04.150 --> 00:13:06.150
and Saudi Arabia, and Russia, European Union,

00:13:06.150 --> 00:13:08.150
Japan, so on and so forth.

00:13:08.150 --> 00:13:12.150
The white line reproduces the analysis

00:13:12.150 --> 00:13:14.150
if the international environment

00:13:14.150 --> 00:13:17.150
just left Iran to make its own internal decisions,

00:13:17.150 --> 00:13:19.150
under its own domestic political pressures.

00:13:19.150 --> 00:13:21.150
That's not going to be happening,

00:13:21.150 --> 00:13:25.150
but you can see that the line comes down faster

00:13:25.150 --> 00:13:28.150
if they're not put under international pressure,

00:13:28.150 --> 00:13:30.150
if they're allowed to pursue their own devices.

00:13:30.150 --> 00:13:33.150
But in any event, by the end of this year,

00:13:33.150 --> 00:13:36.150
beginning of next year, we get to a stable equilibrium outcome.

00:13:36.150 --> 00:13:40.150
And that equilibrium is not what the United States would like,

00:13:40.150 --> 00:13:43.150
but it's probably an equilibrium that the United States can live with,

00:13:43.150 --> 00:13:45.150
and that a lot of others can live with.

00:13:45.150 --> 00:13:49.150
And that is that Iran will achieve that nationalist pride

00:13:49.150 --> 00:13:53.150
by making enough weapons-grade fuel, through research,

00:13:53.150 --> 00:13:57.150
so that they could show that they know how to make weapons-grade fuel,

00:13:57.150 --> 00:14:02.150
but not enough to actually build a bomb.

00:14:02.150 --> 00:14:04.150
How is this happening?

00:14:04.150 --> 00:14:08.150
Over here you can see this is the distribution

00:14:08.150 --> 00:14:13.150
of power in favor of civilian nuclear energy today,

00:14:13.150 --> 00:14:16.150
this is what that power block is predicted to be like

00:14:16.150 --> 00:14:22.150
by the late parts of 2010, early parts of 2011.

00:14:22.150 --> 00:14:26.150
Just about nobody supports research on weapons-grade fuel today,

00:14:26.150 --> 00:14:29.150
but by 2011 that gets to be a big block,

00:14:29.150 --> 00:14:33.150
and you put these two together, that's the controlling influence in Iran.

00:14:33.150 --> 00:14:36.150
Out here today, there are a bunch of people --

00:14:36.150 --> 00:14:38.150
Ahmadinejad for example --

00:14:38.150 --> 00:14:40.150
who would like not only to build a bomb,

00:14:40.150 --> 00:14:42.150
but test a bomb.

00:14:42.150 --> 00:14:44.150
That power disappears completely;

00:14:44.150 --> 00:14:47.150
nobody supports that by 2011.

00:14:47.150 --> 00:14:49.150
These guys are all shrinking,

00:14:49.150 --> 00:14:52.150
the power is all drifting out here,

00:14:52.150 --> 00:14:55.150
so the outcome is going to be the weapons-grade fuel.

00:14:55.150 --> 00:14:58.150
Who are the winners and who are the losers in Iran?

00:14:58.150 --> 00:15:01.150
Take a look at these guys, they're growing in power,

00:15:01.150 --> 00:15:04.150
and by the way, this was done a while ago

00:15:04.150 --> 00:15:06.150
before the current economic crisis,

00:15:06.150 --> 00:15:08.150
and that's probably going to get steeper.

00:15:08.150 --> 00:15:10.150
These folks are the moneyed interests in Iran,

00:15:10.150 --> 00:15:14.150
the bankers, the oil people, the bazaaries.

00:15:14.150 --> 00:15:17.150
They are growing in political clout,

00:15:17.150 --> 00:15:20.150
as the mullahs are isolating themselves --

00:15:20.150 --> 00:15:22.150
with the exception of one group of mullahs,

00:15:22.150 --> 00:15:24.150
who are not well known to Americans.

00:15:24.150 --> 00:15:26.150
That's this line here, growing in power,

00:15:26.150 --> 00:15:30.150
these are what the Iranians call the quietists.

00:15:30.150 --> 00:15:33.150
These are the Ayatollahs, mostly based in Qom,

00:15:33.150 --> 00:15:37.150
who have great clout in the religious community,

00:15:37.150 --> 00:15:40.150
have been quiet on politics and are going to be getting louder,

00:15:40.150 --> 00:15:42.150
because they see Iran going in an unhealthy direction,

00:15:42.150 --> 00:15:44.150
a direction contrary

00:15:44.150 --> 00:15:48.150
to what Khomeini had in mind.

00:15:48.150 --> 00:15:50.150
Here is Mr. Ahmadinejad.

00:15:50.150 --> 00:15:53.150
Two things to notice: he's getting weaker,

00:15:53.150 --> 00:15:55.150
and while he gets a lot of attention in the United States,

00:15:55.150 --> 00:15:57.150
he is not a major player in Iran.

00:15:57.150 --> 00:15:59.150
He is on the way down.

00:15:59.150 --> 00:16:03.150
OK, so I'd like you to take a little away from this.

00:16:03.150 --> 00:16:05.150
Everything is not predictable: the stock market

00:16:05.150 --> 00:16:08.150
is, at least for me, not predictable,

00:16:08.150 --> 00:16:13.150
but most complicated negotiations are predictable.

00:16:13.150 --> 00:16:17.150
Again, whether we're talking health policy, education,

00:16:17.150 --> 00:16:20.150
environment, energy,

00:16:20.150 --> 00:16:22.150
litigation, mergers,

00:16:22.150 --> 00:16:24.150
all of these are complicated problems

00:16:24.150 --> 00:16:26.150
that are predictable,

00:16:26.150 --> 00:16:30.150
that this sort of technology can be applied to.

00:16:30.150 --> 00:16:35.150
And the reason that being able to predict those things is important,

00:16:35.150 --> 00:16:38.150
is not just because you might run a hedge fund and make money off of it,

00:16:38.150 --> 00:16:41.150
but because if you can predict what people will do,

00:16:41.150 --> 00:16:44.150
you can engineer what they will do.

00:16:44.150 --> 00:16:46.150
And if you engineer what they do you can change the world,

00:16:46.150 --> 00:16:48.150
you can get a better result.

00:16:48.150 --> 00:16:51.150
I would like to leave you with one thought, which is

00:16:51.150 --> 00:16:56.150
for me, the dominant theme of this gathering,

00:16:56.150 --> 00:16:59.150
and is the dominant theme of this way of thinking about the world.

00:16:59.150 --> 00:17:02.150
When people say to you,

00:17:02.150 --> 00:17:04.150
"That's impossible,"

00:17:04.150 --> 00:17:06.150
you say back to them,

00:17:06.150 --> 00:17:08.150
"When you say 'That's impossible,'

00:17:08.150 --> 00:17:10.150
you're confused with,

00:17:10.150 --> 00:17:13.150
'I don't know how to do it.'"

00:17:13.150 --> 00:17:15.150
Thank you.

00:17:15.150 --> 00:17:19.150
(Applause)

00:17:19.150 --> 00:17:21.150
Chris Anderson: One question for you.

00:17:21.150 --> 00:17:24.150
That was fascinating.

00:17:24.150 --> 00:17:27.150
I love that you put it out there.

00:17:27.150 --> 00:17:29.150
I got very nervous halfway through the talk though,

00:17:29.150 --> 00:17:32.150
just panicking whether you'd included in your model, the possibility that

00:17:32.150 --> 00:17:36.150
putting this prediction out there might change the result.

00:17:36.150 --> 00:17:39.150
We've got 800 people in Tehran who watch TEDTalks.

00:17:39.150 --> 00:17:41.150
Bruce Bueno de Mesquita: I've thought about that,

00:17:41.150 --> 00:17:45.150
and since I've done a lot of work for the intelligence community,

00:17:45.150 --> 00:17:47.150
they've also pondered that.

00:17:47.150 --> 00:17:50.150
It would be a good thing if

00:17:50.150 --> 00:17:53.150
people paid more attention, took seriously,

00:17:53.150 --> 00:17:55.150
and engaged in the same sorts of calculations,

00:17:55.150 --> 00:17:59.150
because it would change things. But it would change things in two beneficial ways.

00:17:59.150 --> 00:18:05.150
It would hasten how quickly people arrive at an agreement,

00:18:05.150 --> 00:18:08.150
and so it would save everybody a lot of grief and time.

00:18:08.150 --> 00:18:12.150
And, it would arrive at an agreement that everybody was happy with,

00:18:12.150 --> 00:18:15.150
without having to manipulate them so much --

00:18:15.150 --> 00:18:18.150
which is basically what I do, I manipulate them.

00:18:18.150 --> 00:18:20.150
So it would be a good thing.

00:18:20.150 --> 00:18:24.150
CA: So you're kind of trying to say, "People of Iran, this is your destiny, lets go there."

00:18:24.150 --> 00:18:30.150
BBM: Well, people of Iran, this is what many of you are going to evolve to want,

00:18:30.150 --> 00:18:32.150
and we could get there a lot sooner,

00:18:32.150 --> 00:18:35.150
and you would suffer a lot less trouble from economic sanctions,

00:18:35.150 --> 00:18:41.150
and we would suffer a lot less fear of the use of military force on our end,

00:18:41.150 --> 00:18:43.150
and the world would be a better place.

00:18:43.150 --> 00:18:46.150
CA: Here's hoping they hear it that way. Thank you very much Bruce.

00:18:46.150 --> 00:18:48.150
BBM: Thank you.

00:18:48.150 --> 00:18:53.150
(Applause)
