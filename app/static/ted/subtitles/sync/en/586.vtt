00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:14.150
A month ago today

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:16.150
I stood there:

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:18.150
90 degrees south, the top of

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:20.150
the bottom of the world, the Geographic South Pole.

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:23.150
And I stood there beside two very good friends of mine,

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:25.150
Richard Weber and Kevin Vallely.

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:28.150
Together we had just broken the world speed record

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:30.150
for a trek to the South Pole.

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.150
It took us 33 days,

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:36.150
23 hours and 55 minutes to get there.

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:40.150
We shaved five days off the previous best time.

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:43.150
And in the process, I became the first person in history

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:45.150
to make the entire 650-mile journey,

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:48.150
from Hercules Inlet to South Pole,

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:51.150
solely on feet, without skis.

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:53.150
Now, many of you are probably saying, "Wait a sec,

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:56.150
is this tough to do?"

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:57.150
(Laughter)

00:00:57.150 --> 00:00:59.150
Imagine, if you will,

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:01.150
dragging a sled, as you just saw in that video clip,

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:04.150
with 170 pounds of gear,

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:07.150
in it everything you need to survive on your Antarctic trek.

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:09.150
It's going to be 40 below, every single day.

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.150
You'll be in a massive headwind.

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:14.150
And at some point you're going to have to cross these cracks in the ice,

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:16.150
these crevasses.

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:19.150
Some of them have a very precarious thin footbridge underneath them

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:21.150
that could give way at a moment's notice,

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:26.150
taking your sled, you, into the abyss, never to be seen again.

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:29.150
The punchline to your journey? Look at the horizon.

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:31.150
Yes, it's uphill the entire way,

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:33.150
because the South Pole is at 10,000 feet,

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:37.150
and you're starting at sea level.

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:39.150
Our journey did not, in fact, begin at Hercules Inlet,

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:42.150
where frozen ocean meets the land of Antarctica.

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.150
It began a little less than two years ago.

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:46.150
A couple of buddies of mine and I

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:50.150
had finished a 111-day run across the entire Sahara desert.

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:52.150
And while we were there we learned

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:55.150
the seriousness of the water crisis in Northern Africa.

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:58.150
We also learned that many of the issues facing the people of Northern Africa

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:02.150
affected young people the most.

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:05.150
I came home to my wife after 111 days of running in the sand,

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:08.150
and I said, "You know, there's no doubt if this bozo can get across the desert,

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:12.150
we are capable of doing anything we set our minds to."

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:14.150
But if I'm going to continue doing these adventures, there has to be

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:16.150
a reason for me to do them

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:19.150
beyond just getting there.

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:22.150
Around that time I met an extraordinary human being,

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:24.150
Peter Thum, who inspired me with his actions.

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:28.150
He's trying to find and solve water issues, the crisis around the world.

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:31.150
His dedication inspired me to come up with this expedition:

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:33.150
a run to the South Pole

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:35.150
where, with an interactive website,

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:38.150
I will be able to bring young people, students and teachers from around the world

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:40.150
on board the expedition with me,

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:42.150
as active members.

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:46.150
So we would have a live website, that every single day of the 33 days,

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:49.150
we would be blogging, telling stories of,

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:52.150
you know, depleted ozone forcing us to cover our faces,

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:55.150
or we will burn.

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:57.150
Crossing miles and miles of sastrugi --

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:01.150
frozen ice snowdrifts that could be hip-deep.

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:03.150
I'm telling you, crossing these things with 170-pound sled,

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:05.150
that sled may as well have weighed 1,700 pounds,

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:07.150
because that's what it felt like.

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:09.150
We were blogging to this live website daily

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:11.150
to these students that were tracking us as well,

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:13.150
about 10-hour trekking days,

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:15.150
15-hour trekking days,

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:20.150
sometimes 20 hours of trekking daily to meet our goal.

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:24.150
We'd catch cat-naps at 40 below on our sled, incidentally.

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:26.150
In turn, students,

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:28.150
people from around the world, would ask us questions.

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:30.150
Young people would ask the most amazing questions.

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:34.150
One of my favorite: It's 40 below, you've got to go to the bathroom,

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:36.150
where are you going to go and how are you going to do it?

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:40.150
I'm not going to answer that. But I will answer some of the more popular questions.

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:43.150
Where do you sleep? We slept in a tent that was very low to the ground,

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:47.150
because the winds on Antarctica were so extreme, it would blow anything else away.

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:50.150
What do you eat? One of my favorite dishes on expedition:

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:53.150
butter and bacon. It's about a million calories.

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:55.150
We were burning about 8,500 a day,

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:58.150
so we needed it.

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:01.150
How many batteries do you carry for all the equipment that you have?

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:04.150
Virtually none. All of our equipment, including film equipment,

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:06.150
was charged by the sun.

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:09.150
And do you get along? I certainly hope so,

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:11.150
because at some point or another on this expedition,

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:13.150
one of your teammates is going to have to take a very big needle,

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:16.150
and put it in an infected blister, and drain it for you.

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:19.150
But seriously, seriously, we did get along,

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:22.150
because we had a common goal of wanting to inspire these young people.

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:25.150
They were our teammates! They were inspiring us.

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:29.150
The stories we were hearing got us to the South Pole.

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:32.150
The website worked brilliantly as a two-way street of communication.

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:35.150
Young people in northern Canada, kids in an elementary school,

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:38.150
dragging sleds across the school-yard,

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:42.150
pretending they were Richard, Ray and Kevin. Amazing.

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:45.150
We arrived at the South Pole. We huddled into that tent,

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:48.150
45 below that day, I'll never forget it.

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:51.150
We looked at each other with these looks

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:55.150
of disbelief at what we had just completed.

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:57.150
And I remember looking at the guys thinking,

00:04:57.150 --> 00:05:00.150
"What do I take from this journey?" You know? Seriously.

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:04.150
That I'm this uber-endurance guy?

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:06.150
As I stand here today talking to you guys,

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:08.150
I've been running for the grand sum of five years.

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:12.150
And a year before that I was a pack-a-day smoker,

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:14.150
living a very sedentary lifestyle.

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:17.150
What I take from this journey, from my journeys,

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:19.150
is that, in fact,

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:22.150
within every fiber of my belief standing here,

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:25.150
I know that we can make the impossible possible.

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:28.150
I'm learning this at 40.

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:32.150
Can you imagine? Seriously, can you imagine?

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:34.150
I'm learning this at 40 years of age.

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:36.150
Imagine being 13 years old,

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:39.150
hearing those words, and believing it.

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:41.150
Thank you very much. Thank you.

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:47.150
(Applause)
