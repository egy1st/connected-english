00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.150
Now, if President Obama

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:19.150
invited me to be the next Czar of Mathematics,

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:22.150
then I would have a suggestion for him

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:24.150
that I think would vastly improve

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.150
the mathematics education in this country.

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.150
And it would be easy to implement

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:31.150
and inexpensive.

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:33.150
The mathematics curriculum that we have

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:37.150
is based on a foundation of arithmetic and algebra.

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:39.150
And everything we learn after that

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:42.150
is building up towards one subject.

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:46.150
And at top of that pyramid, it's calculus.

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:48.150
And I'm here to say

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:52.150
that I think that that is the wrong summit of the pyramid ...

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:54.150
that the correct summit -- that all of our students,

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:56.150
every high school graduate should know --

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:59.150
should be statistics:

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:01.150
probability and statistics.

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:03.150
(Applause)

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:07.150
I mean, don't get me wrong. Calculus is an important subject.

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:09.150
It's one of the great products of the human mind.

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:13.150
The laws of nature are written in the language of calculus.

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:17.150
And every student who studies math, science, engineering, economics,

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:19.150
they should definitely learn calculus

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:21.150
by the end of their freshman year of college.

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:24.150
But I'm here to say, as a professor of mathematics,

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:28.150
that very few people actually use calculus

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:31.150
in a conscious, meaningful way, in their day-to-day lives.

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:33.150
On the other hand,

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:36.150
statistics -- that's a subject that you could,

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:39.150
and should, use on daily basis. Right?

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:42.150
It's risk. It's reward. It's randomness.

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.150
It's understanding data.

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:46.150
I think if our students, if our high school students --

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:48.150
if all of the American citizens --

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:51.150
knew about probability and statistics,

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:54.150
we wouldn't be in the economic mess that we're in today. (Laughter) (Applause)

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:57.150
Not only -- thank you -- not only that ...

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:00.150
but if it's taught properly, it can be a lot of fun.

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:02.150
I mean, probability and statistics,

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:06.150
it's the mathematics of games and gambling.

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:10.150
It's analyzing trends. It's predicting the future.

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:12.150
Look, the world has changed

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:15.150
from analog to digital.

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:18.150
And it's time for our mathematics curriculum to change

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:20.150
from analog to digital,

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:24.150
from the more classical, continuous mathematics,

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:27.150
to the more modern, discrete mathematics --

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:29.150
the mathematics of uncertainty,

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:31.150
of randomness, of data --

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:34.150
that being probability and statistics.

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:36.150
In summary, instead of our students

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:39.150
learning about the techniques of calculus,

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:42.150
I think it would be far more significant

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:45.150
if all of them knew what two standard deviations

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:48.150
from the mean means. And I mean it.

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:50.150
Thank you very much.

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:53.150
(Applause)
