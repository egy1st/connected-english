00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.150
Today I'm going to talk to you about the problem of other minds.

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:17.150
And the problem I'm going to talk about

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:20.150
is not the familiar one from philosophy,

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:22.150
which is, "How can we know

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:24.150
whether other people have minds?"

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.150
That is, maybe you have a mind,

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:29.150
and everyone else is just a really convincing robot.

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:31.150
So that's a problem in philosophy,

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:33.150
but for today's purposes I'm going to assume

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:35.150
that many people in this audience have a mind,

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:37.150
and that I don't have to worry about this.

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:40.150
There is a second problem that is maybe even more familiar to us

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:43.150
as parents and teachers and spouses

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:45.150
and novelists,

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:47.150
which is, "Why is it so hard

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:49.150
to know what somebody else wants or believes?"

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:51.150
Or perhaps, more relevantly,

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:54.150
"Why is it so hard to change what somebody else wants or believes?"

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:56.150
I think novelists put this best.

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:58.150
Like Philip Roth, who said,

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:01.150
"And yet, what are we to do about this terribly significant business

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:03.150
of other people?

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:05.150
So ill equipped are we all,

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:07.150
to envision one another's interior workings

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:09.150
and invisible aims."

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.150
So as a teacher and as a spouse,

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.150
this is, of course, a problem I confront every day.

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:17.150
But as a scientist, I'm interested in a different problem of other minds,

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:20.150
and that is the one I'm going to introduce to you today.

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:22.150
And that problem is, "How is it so easy

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:24.150
to know other minds?"

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.150
So to start with an illustration,

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:28.150
you need almost no information,

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:30.150
one snapshot of a stranger,

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.150
to guess what this woman is thinking,

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:35.150
or what this man is.

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:37.150
And put another way, the crux of the problem is

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:40.150
the machine that we use for thinking about other minds,

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:43.150
our brain, is made up of pieces, brain cells,

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:45.150
that we share with all other animals, with monkeys

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:48.150
and mice and even sea slugs.

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:51.150
And yet, you put them together in a particular network,

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:54.150
and what you get is the capacity to write Romeo and Juliet.

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:56.150
Or to say, as Alan Greenspan did,

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:59.150
"I know you think you understand what you thought I said,

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:01.150
but I'm not sure you realize that what you heard

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:03.150
is not what I meant."

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:06.150
(Laughter)

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:08.150
So, the job of my field of cognitive neuroscience

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:10.150
is to stand with these ideas,

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:12.150
one in each hand.

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:15.150
And to try to understand how you can put together

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:19.150
simple units, simple messages over space and time, in a network,

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:23.150
and get this amazing human capacity to think about minds.

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:26.150
So I'm going to tell you three things about this today.

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:29.150
Obviously the whole project here is huge.

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:32.150
And I'm going to tell you just our first few steps

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:34.150
about the discovery of a special brain region

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:36.150
for thinking about other people's thoughts.

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:38.150
Some observations on the slow development of this system

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:42.150
as we learn how to do this difficult job.

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:44.150
And then finally, to show that some of the differences

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:47.150
between people, in how we judge others,

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:51.150
can be explained by differences in this brain system.

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:53.150
So first, the first thing I want to tell you is that

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:56.150
there is a brain region in the human brain, in your brains,

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:59.150
whose job it is to think about other people's thoughts.

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:01.150
This is a picture of it.

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:03.150
It's called the Right Temporo-Parietal Junction.

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:05.150
It's above and behind your right ear.

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:07.150
And this is the brain region you used when you saw the pictures I showed you,

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:09.150
or when you read Romeo and Juliet

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:12.150
or when you tried to understand Alan Greenspan.

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:16.150
And you don't use it for solving any other kinds of logical problems.

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:19.150
So this brain region is called the Right TPJ.

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:21.150
And this picture shows the average activation

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:23.150
in a group of what we call typical human adults.

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:25.150
They're MIT undergraduates.

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:29.150
(Laughter)

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:31.150
The second thing I want to say about this brain system

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:33.150
is that although we human adults

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:35.150
are really good at understanding other minds,

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:37.150
we weren't always that way.

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:40.150
It takes children a long time to break into the system.

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:44.150
I'm going to show you a little bit of that long, extended process.

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:47.150
The first thing I'm going to show you is a change between age three and five,

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:49.150
as kids learn to understand

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:52.150
that somebody else can have beliefs that are different from their own.

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:54.150
So I'm going to show you a five-year-old

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:56.150
who is getting a standard kind of puzzle

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:59.150
that we call the false belief task.

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:02.150
Rebecca Saxe (Video): This is the first pirate. His name is Ivan.

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:04.150
And you know what pirates really like?

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:07.150
Child: What? RS: Pirates really like cheese sandwiches.

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:10.150
Child: Cheese? I love cheese!

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:12.150
RS: Yeah. So Ivan has this cheese sandwich,

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:14.150
and he says, "Yum yum yum yum yum!

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:16.150
I really love cheese sandwiches."

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:20.150
And Ivan puts his sandwich over here, on top of the pirate chest.

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:24.150
And Ivan says, "You know what? I need a drink with my lunch."

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:27.150
And so Ivan goes to get a drink.

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:29.150
And while Ivan is away

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:32.150
the wind comes,

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:34.150
and it blows the sandwich down onto the grass.

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:38.150
And now, here comes the other pirate.

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:41.150
This pirate is called Joshua.

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:43.150
And Joshua also really loves cheese sandwiches.

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:45.150
So Joshua has a cheese sandwich and he says,

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:49.150
"Yum yum yum yum yum! I love cheese sandwiches."

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:52.150
And he puts his cheese sandwich over here on top of the pirate chest.

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:54.150
Child: So, that one is his.

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:56.150
RS: That one is Joshua's. That's right.

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:58.150
Child: And then his went on the ground.

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:00.150
RS: That's exactly right.

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:02.150
Child: So he won't know which one is his.

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:05.150
RS: Oh. So now Joshua goes off to get a drink.

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:09.150
Ivan comes back and he says, "I want my cheese sandwich."

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:12.150
So which one do you think Ivan is going to take?

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:14.150
Child: I think he is going to take that one.

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:16.150
RS: Yeah, you think he's going to take that one? All right. Let's see.

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:19.150
Oh yeah, you were right. He took that one.

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:21.150
So that's a five-year-old who clearly understands

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:23.150
that other people can have false beliefs

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:25.150
and what the consequences are for their actions.

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:28.150
Now I'm going to show you a three-year-old

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:30.150
who got the same puzzle.

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:32.150
RS: And Ivan says, "I want my cheese sandwich."

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:35.150
Which sandwich is he going to take?

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:37.150
Do you think he's going to take that one? Let's see what happens.

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:39.150
Let's see what he does. Here comes Ivan.

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:42.150
And he says, "I want my cheese sandwich."

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:44.150
And he takes this one.

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:47.150
Uh-oh. Why did he take that one?

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:51.150
Child: His was on the grass.

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:54.150
So the three-year-old does two things differently.

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:57.150
First, he predicts Ivan will take the sandwich

00:05:57.150 --> 00:05:59.150
that's really his.

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:03.150
And second, when he sees Ivan taking the sandwich where he left his,

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:06.150
where we would say he's taking that one because he thinks it's his,

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:09.150
the three-year-old comes up with another explanation:

00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:11.150
He's not taking his own sandwich because he doesn't want it,

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:13.150
because now it's dirty, on the ground.

00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:15.150
So that's why he's taking the other sandwich.

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:19.150
Now of course, development doesn't end at five.

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:21.150
And we can see the continuation of this process

00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:23.150
of learning to think about other people's thoughts

00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:25.150
by upping the ante

00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:28.150
and asking children now, not for an action prediction,

00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:30.150
but for a moral judgment.

00:06:30.150 --> 00:06:32.150
So first I'm going to show you the three-year-old again.

00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:35.150
RS.: So is Ivan being mean and naughty for taking Joshua's sandwich?

00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:36.150
Child: Yeah.

00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:39.150
RS: Should Ivan get in trouble for taking Joshua's sandwich?

00:06:39.150 --> 00:06:41.150
Child: Yeah.

00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:43.150
So it's maybe not surprising he thinks it was mean of Ivan

00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:45.150
to take Joshua's sandwich,

00:06:45.150 --> 00:06:47.150
since he thinks Ivan only took Joshua's sandwich

00:06:47.150 --> 00:06:50.150
to avoid having to eat his own dirty sandwich.

00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:52.150
But now I'm going to show you the five-year-old.

00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:54.150
Remember the five-year-old completely understood

00:06:54.150 --> 00:06:56.150
why Ivan took Joshua's sandwich.

00:06:56.150 --> 00:06:58.150
RS: Was Ivan being mean and naughty

00:06:58.150 --> 00:07:00.150
for taking Joshua's sandwich?

00:07:00.150 --> 00:07:02.150
Child: Um, yeah.

00:07:02.150 --> 00:07:04.150
And so, it is not until age seven

00:07:04.150 --> 00:07:07.150
that we get what looks more like an adult response.

00:07:07.150 --> 00:07:10.150
RS: Should Ivan get in trouble for taking Joshua's sandwich?

00:07:10.150 --> 00:07:12.150
Child: No, because the wind should get in trouble.

00:07:12.150 --> 00:07:15.150
He says the wind should get in trouble

00:07:15.150 --> 00:07:17.150
for switching the sandwiches.

00:07:17.150 --> 00:07:19.150
(Laughter)

00:07:19.150 --> 00:07:21.150
And now what we've started to do in my lab

00:07:21.150 --> 00:07:23.150
is to put children into the brain scanner

00:07:23.150 --> 00:07:26.150
and ask what's going on in their brain

00:07:26.150 --> 00:07:29.150
as they develop this ability to think about other people's thoughts.

00:07:29.150 --> 00:07:33.150
So the first thing is that in children we see this same brain region, the Right TPJ,

00:07:33.150 --> 00:07:36.150
being used while children are thinking about other people.

00:07:36.150 --> 00:07:38.150
But it's not quite like the adult brain.

00:07:38.150 --> 00:07:40.150
So whereas in the adults, as I told you,

00:07:40.150 --> 00:07:43.150
this brain region is almost completely specialized --

00:07:43.150 --> 00:07:46.150
it does almost nothing else except for thinking about other people's thoughts --

00:07:46.150 --> 00:07:48.150
in children it's much less so,

00:07:48.150 --> 00:07:50.150
when they are age five to eight,

00:07:50.150 --> 00:07:52.150
the age range of the children I just showed you.

00:07:52.150 --> 00:07:55.150
And actually if we even look at eight to 11-year-olds,

00:07:55.150 --> 00:07:57.150
getting into early adolescence,

00:07:57.150 --> 00:08:00.150
they still don't have quite an adult-like brain region.

00:08:00.150 --> 00:08:03.150
And so, what we can see is that over the course of childhood

00:08:03.150 --> 00:08:05.150
and even into adolescence,

00:08:05.150 --> 00:08:07.150
both the cognitive system,

00:08:07.150 --> 00:08:09.150
our mind's ability to think about other minds,

00:08:09.150 --> 00:08:11.150
and the brain system that supports it

00:08:11.150 --> 00:08:14.150
are continuing, slowly, to develop.

00:08:14.150 --> 00:08:16.150
But of course, as you're probably aware,

00:08:16.150 --> 00:08:18.150
even in adulthood,

00:08:18.150 --> 00:08:20.150
people differ from one another in how good they are

00:08:20.150 --> 00:08:22.150
at thinking of other minds, how often they do it

00:08:22.150 --> 00:08:24.150
and how accurately.

00:08:24.150 --> 00:08:27.150
And so what we wanted to know was, could differences among adults

00:08:27.150 --> 00:08:29.150
in how they think about other people's thoughts

00:08:29.150 --> 00:08:32.150
be explained in terms of differences in this brain region?

00:08:32.150 --> 00:08:35.150
So, the first thing that we did is we gave adults a version

00:08:35.150 --> 00:08:37.150
of the pirate problem that we gave to the kids.

00:08:37.150 --> 00:08:39.150
And I'm going to give that to you now.

00:08:39.150 --> 00:08:42.150
So Grace and her friend are on a tour of a chemical factory,

00:08:42.150 --> 00:08:44.150
and they take a break for coffee.

00:08:44.150 --> 00:08:47.150
And Grace's friend asks for some sugar in her coffee.

00:08:47.150 --> 00:08:50.150
Grace goes to make the coffee

00:08:50.150 --> 00:08:52.150
and finds by the coffee a pot

00:08:52.150 --> 00:08:55.150
containing a white powder, which is sugar.

00:08:55.150 --> 00:08:58.150
But the powder is labeled "Deadly Poison,"

00:08:58.150 --> 00:09:01.150
so Grace thinks that the powder is a deadly poison.

00:09:01.150 --> 00:09:03.150
And she puts it in her friend's coffee.

00:09:03.150 --> 00:09:06.150
And her friend drinks the coffee, and is fine.

00:09:06.150 --> 00:09:08.150
How many people think it was morally permissible

00:09:08.150 --> 00:09:12.150
for Grace to put the powder in the coffee?

00:09:12.150 --> 00:09:15.150
Okay. Good. (Laughter)

00:09:15.150 --> 00:09:18.150
So we ask people, how much should Grace be blamed

00:09:18.150 --> 00:09:20.150
in this case, which we call a failed attempt to harm?

00:09:20.150 --> 00:09:22.150
And we can compare that to another case,

00:09:22.150 --> 00:09:24.150
where everything in the real world is the same.

00:09:24.150 --> 00:09:27.150
The powder is still sugar, but what's different is what Grace thinks.

00:09:27.150 --> 00:09:30.150
Now she thinks the powder is sugar.

00:09:30.150 --> 00:09:33.150
And perhaps unsurprisingly, if Grace thinks the powder is sugar

00:09:33.150 --> 00:09:35.150
and puts it in her friend's coffee,

00:09:35.150 --> 00:09:37.150
people say she deserves no blame at all.

00:09:37.150 --> 00:09:41.150
Whereas if she thinks the powder was poison, even though it's really sugar,

00:09:41.150 --> 00:09:44.150
now people say she deserves a lot of blame,

00:09:44.150 --> 00:09:47.150
even though what happened in the real world was exactly the same.

00:09:47.150 --> 00:09:49.150
And in fact, they say she deserves more blame

00:09:49.150 --> 00:09:51.150
in this case, the failed attempt to harm,

00:09:51.150 --> 00:09:53.150
than in another case,

00:09:53.150 --> 00:09:55.150
which we call an accident.

00:09:55.150 --> 00:09:57.150
Where Grace thought the powder was sugar,

00:09:57.150 --> 00:09:59.150
because it was labeled "sugar" and by the coffee machine,

00:09:59.150 --> 00:10:01.150
but actually the powder was poison.

00:10:01.150 --> 00:10:04.150
So even though when the powder was poison,

00:10:04.150 --> 00:10:07.150
the friend drank the coffee and died,

00:10:07.150 --> 00:10:10.150
people say Grace deserves less blame in that case,

00:10:10.150 --> 00:10:12.150
when she innocently thought it was sugar,

00:10:12.150 --> 00:10:14.150
than in the other case, where she thought it was poison

00:10:14.150 --> 00:10:17.150
and no harm occurred.

00:10:17.150 --> 00:10:19.150
People, though, disagree a little bit

00:10:19.150 --> 00:10:21.150
about exactly how much blame Grace should get

00:10:21.150 --> 00:10:23.150
in the accident case.

00:10:23.150 --> 00:10:25.150
Some people think she should deserve more blame,

00:10:25.150 --> 00:10:27.150
and other people less.

00:10:27.150 --> 00:10:29.150
And what I'm going to show you is what happened when we look inside

00:10:29.150 --> 00:10:31.150
the brains of people while they're making that judgment.

00:10:31.150 --> 00:10:33.150
So what I'm showing you, from left to right,

00:10:33.150 --> 00:10:36.150
is how much activity there was in this brain region,

00:10:36.150 --> 00:10:38.150
and from top to bottom, how much blame

00:10:38.150 --> 00:10:40.150
people said that Grace deserved.

00:10:40.150 --> 00:10:42.150
And what you can see is, on the left

00:10:42.150 --> 00:10:44.150
when there was very little activity in this brain region,

00:10:44.150 --> 00:10:47.150
people paid little attention to her innocent belief

00:10:47.150 --> 00:10:50.150
and said she deserved a lot of blame for the accident.

00:10:50.150 --> 00:10:52.150
Whereas on the right, where there was a lot of activity,

00:10:52.150 --> 00:10:55.150
people paid a lot more attention to her innocent belief,

00:10:55.150 --> 00:10:57.150
and said she deserved a lot less blame

00:10:57.150 --> 00:10:59.150
for causing the accident.

00:10:59.150 --> 00:11:01.150
So that's good, but of course

00:11:01.150 --> 00:11:03.150
what we'd rather is have a way to interfere

00:11:03.150 --> 00:11:05.150
with function in this brain region,

00:11:05.150 --> 00:11:08.150
and see if we could change people's moral judgment.

00:11:08.150 --> 00:11:10.150
And we do have such a tool.

00:11:10.150 --> 00:11:12.150
It's called Trans-Cranial Magnetic Stimulation,

00:11:12.150 --> 00:11:14.150
or TMS.

00:11:14.150 --> 00:11:16.150
This is a tool that lets us pass a magnetic pulse

00:11:16.150 --> 00:11:20.150
through somebody's skull, into a small region of their brain,

00:11:20.150 --> 00:11:24.150
and temporarily disorganize the function of the neurons in that region.

00:11:24.150 --> 00:11:26.150
So I'm going to show you a demo of this.

00:11:26.150 --> 00:11:29.150
First, I'm going to show you that this is a magnetic pulse.

00:11:29.150 --> 00:11:32.150
I'm going to show you what happens when you put a quarter on the machine.

00:11:32.150 --> 00:11:36.150
When you hear clicks, we're turning the machine on.

00:11:42.150 --> 00:11:45.150
So now I'm going to apply that same pulse to my brain,

00:11:45.150 --> 00:11:47.150
to the part of my brain that controls my hand.

00:11:47.150 --> 00:11:50.150
So there is no physical force, just a magnetic pulse.

00:11:54.150 --> 00:11:56.150
Woman (Video): Ready, Rebecca? RS: Yes.

00:11:57.150 --> 00:12:00.150
Okay, so it causes a small involuntary contraction in my hand

00:12:00.150 --> 00:12:03.150
by putting a magnetic pulse in my brain.

00:12:03.150 --> 00:12:05.150
And we can use that same pulse,

00:12:05.150 --> 00:12:07.150
now applied to the RTPJ,

00:12:07.150 --> 00:12:10.150
to ask if we can change people's moral judgments.

00:12:10.150 --> 00:12:12.150
So these are the judgments I showed you before, people's normal moral judgments.

00:12:12.150 --> 00:12:15.150
And then we can apply TMS to the RTPJ

00:12:15.150 --> 00:12:17.150
and ask how people's judgments change.

00:12:17.150 --> 00:12:21.150
And the first thing is, people can still do this task overall.

00:12:21.150 --> 00:12:23.150
So their judgments of the case when everything was fine

00:12:23.150 --> 00:12:26.150
remain the same. They say she deserves no blame.

00:12:26.150 --> 00:12:30.150
But in the case of a failed attempt to harm,

00:12:30.150 --> 00:12:33.150
where Grace thought that it was poison, although it was really sugar,

00:12:33.150 --> 00:12:36.150
people now say it was more okay, she deserves less blame

00:12:36.150 --> 00:12:39.150
for putting the powder in the coffee.

00:12:39.150 --> 00:12:41.150
And in the case of the accident, where she thought that it was sugar,

00:12:41.150 --> 00:12:44.150
but it was really poison and so she caused a death,

00:12:44.150 --> 00:12:50.150
people say that it was less okay, she deserves more blame.

00:12:50.150 --> 00:12:52.150
So what I've told you today is that

00:12:52.150 --> 00:12:56.150
people come, actually, especially well equipped

00:12:56.150 --> 00:12:58.150
to think about other people's thoughts.

00:12:58.150 --> 00:13:00.150
We have a special brain system

00:13:00.150 --> 00:13:03.150
that lets us think about what other people are thinking.

00:13:03.150 --> 00:13:05.150
This system takes a long time to develop,

00:13:05.150 --> 00:13:08.150
slowly throughout the course of childhood and into early adolescence.

00:13:08.150 --> 00:13:11.150
And even in adulthood, differences in this brain region

00:13:11.150 --> 00:13:13.150
can explain differences among adults

00:13:13.150 --> 00:13:16.150
in how we think about and judge other people.

00:13:16.150 --> 00:13:19.150
But I want to give the last word back to the novelists,

00:13:19.150 --> 00:13:22.150
and to Philip Roth, who ended by saying,

00:13:22.150 --> 00:13:24.150
"The fact remains that getting people right

00:13:24.150 --> 00:13:26.150
is not what living is all about anyway.

00:13:26.150 --> 00:13:28.150
It's getting them wrong that is living.

00:13:28.150 --> 00:13:31.150
Getting them wrong and wrong and wrong,

00:13:31.150 --> 00:13:33.150
and then on careful reconsideration,

00:13:33.150 --> 00:13:35.150
getting them wrong again."

00:13:35.150 --> 00:13:37.150
Thank you.

00:13:37.150 --> 00:13:47.150
(Applause)

00:13:47.150 --> 00:13:49.150
Chris Anderson: So, I have a question. When you start talking about using

00:13:49.150 --> 00:13:52.150
magnetic pulses to change people's moral judgments,

00:13:52.150 --> 00:13:55.150
that sounds alarming.

00:13:55.150 --> 00:13:56.150
(Laughter)

00:13:56.150 --> 00:14:00.150
Please tell me that you're not taking phone calls from the Pentagon, say.

00:14:00.150 --> 00:14:02.150
RS: I'm not.

00:14:02.150 --> 00:14:05.150
I mean, they're calling, but I'm not taking the call.

00:14:05.150 --> 00:14:06.150
(Laughter)

00:14:06.150 --> 00:14:08.150
CA: They really are calling?

00:14:08.150 --> 00:14:11.150
So then seriously,

00:14:11.150 --> 00:14:14.150
you must lie awake at night sometimes

00:14:14.150 --> 00:14:16.150
wondering where this work leads.

00:14:16.150 --> 00:14:18.150
I mean, you're clearly an incredible human being,

00:14:18.150 --> 00:14:21.150
but someone could take this knowledge

00:14:21.150 --> 00:14:23.150
and in some future

00:14:23.150 --> 00:14:25.150
not-torture chamber,

00:14:25.150 --> 00:14:28.150
do acts that people here might be worried about.

00:14:28.150 --> 00:14:30.150
RS: Yeah, we worry about this.

00:14:30.150 --> 00:14:33.150
So, there's a couple of things to say about TMS.

00:14:33.150 --> 00:14:35.150
One is that you can't be TMSed without knowing it.

00:14:35.150 --> 00:14:38.150
So it's not a surreptitious technology.

00:14:38.150 --> 00:14:41.150
It's quite hard, actually, to get those very small changes.

00:14:41.150 --> 00:14:44.150
The changes I showed you are impressive to me

00:14:44.150 --> 00:14:46.150
because of what they tell us about the function of the brain,

00:14:46.150 --> 00:14:48.150
but they're small on the scale

00:14:48.150 --> 00:14:50.150
of the moral judgments that we actually make.

00:14:50.150 --> 00:14:52.150
And what we changed was not people's

00:14:52.150 --> 00:14:55.150
moral judgments when they're deciding what to do,

00:14:55.150 --> 00:14:57.150
when they're making action choices.

00:14:57.150 --> 00:15:00.150
We changed their ability to judge other people's actions.

00:15:00.150 --> 00:15:02.150
And so, I think of what I'm doing not so much as

00:15:02.150 --> 00:15:04.150
studying the defendant in a criminal trial,

00:15:04.150 --> 00:15:06.150
but studying the jury.

00:15:06.150 --> 00:15:09.150
CA: Is your work going to lead to any recommendations

00:15:09.150 --> 00:15:12.150
in education, to perhaps bring up

00:15:12.150 --> 00:15:17.150
a generation of kids able to make fairer moral judgments?

00:15:17.150 --> 00:15:20.150
RS: That's one of the idealistic hopes.

00:15:20.150 --> 00:15:24.150
The whole research program here of studying

00:15:24.150 --> 00:15:28.150
the distinctive parts of the human brain is brand new.

00:15:28.150 --> 00:15:30.150
Until recently, what we knew about the brain

00:15:30.150 --> 00:15:33.150
were the things that any other animal's brain could do too,

00:15:33.150 --> 00:15:35.150
so we could study it in animal models.

00:15:35.150 --> 00:15:37.150
We knew how brains see, and how they control the body

00:15:37.150 --> 00:15:39.150
and how they hear and sense.

00:15:39.150 --> 00:15:42.150
And the whole project of understanding

00:15:42.150 --> 00:15:44.150
how brains do the uniquely human things --

00:15:44.150 --> 00:15:47.150
learn language and abstract concepts,

00:15:47.150 --> 00:15:49.150
and thinking about other people's thoughts -- that's brand new.

00:15:49.150 --> 00:15:51.150
And we don't know yet what the implications will be

00:15:51.150 --> 00:15:53.150
of understanding it.

00:15:53.150 --> 00:15:55.150
CA: So I've got one last question. There is this thing called

00:15:55.150 --> 00:15:57.150
the hard problem of consciousness,

00:15:57.150 --> 00:15:59.150
that puzzles a lot of people.

00:15:59.150 --> 00:16:02.150
The notion that you can understand

00:16:02.150 --> 00:16:04.150
why a brain works, perhaps.

00:16:04.150 --> 00:16:07.150
But why does anyone have to feel anything?

00:16:07.150 --> 00:16:10.150
Why does it seem to require these beings who sense things

00:16:10.150 --> 00:16:12.150
for us to operate?

00:16:12.150 --> 00:16:15.150
You're a brilliant young neuroscientist.

00:16:15.150 --> 00:16:17.150
I mean, what chances do you think there are

00:16:17.150 --> 00:16:19.150
that at some time in your career,

00:16:19.150 --> 00:16:21.150
someone, you or someone else,

00:16:21.150 --> 00:16:23.150
is going to come up with some paradigm shift

00:16:23.150 --> 00:16:27.150
in understanding what seems an impossible problem?

00:16:27.150 --> 00:16:31.150
RS: I hope they do. And I think they probably won't.

00:16:31.150 --> 00:16:34.150
CA: Why?

00:16:34.150 --> 00:16:37.150
RS: It's not called the hard problem of consciousness for nothing.

00:16:37.150 --> 00:16:39.150
(Laughter)

00:16:39.150 --> 00:16:42.150
CA: That's a great answer. Rebecca Saxe, thank you very much. That was fantastic.

00:16:42.150 --> 00:16:46.150
(Applause)
