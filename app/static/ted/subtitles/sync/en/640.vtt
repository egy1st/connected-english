00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:14.150
My name is Jonathan Zittrain,

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:17.150
and in my recent work I've been a bit of a pessimist.

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:21.150
So I thought this morning I would try to be the optimist,

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.150
and give reason to hope

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:25.150
for the future of the Internet

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:28.150
by drawing upon its present.

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:32.150
Now, it may seem like there is less hope today than there was before.

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:34.150
People are less kind. There is less trust around.

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:38.150
I don't know. As a simple example,

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:40.150
we could run a test here.

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:47.150
How many people have ever hitchhiked?

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:50.150
I know. How many people have hitchhiked

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:55.150
within the past 10 years?

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:58.150
Right. So what has changed?

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:01.150
It's not better public transportation.

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:04.150
So that's one reason to think that we might be

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:07.150
declensionists, going in the wrong direction.

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:10.150
But I want to give you three examples

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:13.150
to try to say that the trend line

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:15.150
is in fact in the other direction,

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:18.150
and it's the Internet helping it along.

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:21.150
So example number one: the Internet itself.

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:25.150
These are three of the founders of the Internet.

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:27.150
They were actually high school classmates together

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:31.150
at the same high school in suburban Los Angles in the 1960s.

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:34.150
You might have had a French club or a Debate club.

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:36.150
They had a "Let's build a global network" club,

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:39.150
and it worked out very well.

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:42.150
They are pictured here for their 25th anniversary

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:45.150
Newsweek retrospective on the Internet.

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:47.150
And as you can tell,

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:50.150
they are basically goof balls.

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:53.150
They had one great limitation

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:55.150
and one great freedom

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:58.150
as they tried to conceive of a global network.

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:02.150
The limitation was that they didn't have any money.

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:05.150
No particular amount of capital to invest,

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:07.150
of the sort that for a physical network

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:09.150
you might need for trucks and people

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:12.150
and a hub to move packages around overnight.

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:14.150
They had none of that.

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:16.150
But they had an amazing freedom,

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:20.150
which was they didn't have to make any money from it.

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:24.150
The Internet has no business plan, never did.

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:26.150
No CEO,

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:30.150
no firm responsible, singly, for building it.

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:32.150
Instead, it's folks getting together

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:35.150
to do something for fun,

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:37.150
rather than because they were told to,

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:41.150
or because they were expecting to make a mint off of it.

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:44.150
That ethos led to a network architecture,

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:46.150
a structure that was unlike

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:50.150
other digital networks then or since.

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:52.150
So unusual, in fact,

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:56.150
that it was said that it's not clear the Internet could work.

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:59.150
As late as 1992, IBM was known to say

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:02.150
you couldn't possibly build a corporate network

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:05.150
using Internet Protocol.

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:07.150
And even some Internet engineers today say

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:11.150
the whole thing is a pilot project and the jury is still out.

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:12.150
(Laughter)

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:16.150
That's why the mascot of Internet engineering,

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:19.150
if it had one, is said to be the bumblebee.

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:22.150
Because the fur-to-wingspan ratio of the bumblebee

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:24.150
is far too large for it to be able to fly.

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:29.150
And yet, mysteriously, somehow the bee flies.

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:32.150
I'm pleased to say that, thanks to massive government funding,

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:35.150
about three years ago we finally figured out

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:37.150
how bees fly.

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:39.150
(Laughter)

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:41.150
It's very complicated, but it turns out they

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:44.150
flap their wings very quickly.

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:47.150
(Laughter)

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:51.150
So what is this bizarre architecture configuration

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:54.150
that makes the network sing and be so unusual?

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:56.150
Well, to move data around

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:59.150
from one place to another -- again, it's not like a package courier.

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:02.150
It's more like a mosh pit.

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:03.150
(Laughter)

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:05.150
Imagine, you being part of a network

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:08.150
where, you're maybe at a sporting event,

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:10.150
and you're sitting in rows like this,

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:12.150
and somebody asks for a beer,

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:15.150
and it gets handed at the aisle.

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:17.150
And your neighborly duty

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:19.150
is to pass the beer along,

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:22.150
at risk to your own trousers,

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:24.150
to get it to the destination.

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:26.150
No one pays you to do this.

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:29.150
It's just part of your neighborly duty.

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:33.150
And, in a way, that's exactly how packets move around the Internet,

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:35.150
sometimes in as many as 25 or 30 hops,

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:37.150
with the intervening entities

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:39.150
that are passing the data around

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:43.150
having no particular contractual or legal obligation

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:45.150
to the original sender

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:48.150
or to the receiver.

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:52.150
Now, of course, in a mosh pit it's hard to specify a destination.

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:54.150
You need a lot of trust,

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:57.150
but it's not like, "I'm trying to get to Pensacola, please."

00:04:57.150 --> 00:05:01.150
So the Internet needs addressing and directions.

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:05.150
It turns out there is no one overall map of the Internet.

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:08.150
Instead, again, it is as if we are all sitting together in a theater,

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:11.150
but we can only see amidst the fog

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:13.150
the people immediately around us.

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:16.150
So what do we do to figure out who is where?

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:18.150
We turn to the person on the right,

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:21.150
and we tell that person what we see on our left,

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:23.150
and vice versa.

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:25.150
And they can lather, rinse, repeat. And before you know it,

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:28.150
you have a general sense of where everything is.

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:33.150
This is how Internet addressing and routing actually work.

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:37.150
This is a system that relies on kindness and trust,

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:40.150
which also makes it very delicate and vulnerable.

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:42.150
In rare but striking instances,

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:45.150
a single lie told by just one entity

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:47.150
in this honeycomb

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:49.150
can lead to real trouble.

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:52.150
So, for example, last year,

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:54.150
the government of Pakistan

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:57.150
asked its Internet service providers there

00:05:57.150 --> 00:06:01.150
to prevent citizens of Pakistan from seeing YouTube.

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:03.150
There was a video there that the government did not like

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:05.150
and they wanted to make sure it was blocked.

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:07.150
This is a common occurrence. Governments everywhere

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:09.150
are often trying to block

00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:12.150
and filter and censor content on the Internet.

00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:14.150
Well this one ISP in Pakistan

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:17.150
chose to effectuate the block for its subscribers

00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:20.150
in a rather unusual way.

00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:22.150
It advertised --

00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:25.150
the way that you might be asked, if you were part of the Internet,

00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:27.150
to declare what you see near you -- it advertised

00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:32.150
that near it, in fact, it had suddenly awakened to find

00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:34.150
that it was YouTube.

00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:37.150
"That's right," it said, "I am YouTube."

00:06:37.150 --> 00:06:39.150
Which meant that packets of data

00:06:39.150 --> 00:06:41.150
from subscribers going to YouTube

00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:44.150
stopped at the ISP, since they thought they were already there,

00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:46.150
and the ISP threw them away unopened

00:06:46.150 --> 00:06:48.150
because the point was to block it.

00:06:48.150 --> 00:06:50.150
But it didn't stop there.

00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:52.150
You see, that announcement

00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:54.150
went one click out,

00:06:54.150 --> 00:06:57.150
which got reverberated, one click out.

00:06:57.150 --> 00:06:59.150
And it turns out that as you look

00:06:59.150 --> 00:07:01.150
at the postmortem of this event,

00:07:01.150 --> 00:07:03.150
you have at one moment

00:07:03.150 --> 00:07:05.150
perfectly working YouTube.

00:07:05.150 --> 00:07:07.150
Then, at moment number two,

00:07:07.150 --> 00:07:10.150
you have the fake announcement go out.

00:07:10.150 --> 00:07:12.150
And within two minutes,

00:07:12.150 --> 00:07:14.150
it reverberates around

00:07:14.150 --> 00:07:17.150
and YouTube is blocked everywhere in the world.

00:07:17.150 --> 00:07:20.150
If you were sitting in Oxford, England, trying to get to YouTube,

00:07:20.150 --> 00:07:22.150
your packets were going to Pakistan

00:07:22.150 --> 00:07:25.150
and they weren't coming back.

00:07:25.150 --> 00:07:27.150
Now just think about that.

00:07:27.150 --> 00:07:29.150
One of the most popular websites in the world,

00:07:29.150 --> 00:07:31.150
run by the most powerful company in the world,

00:07:31.150 --> 00:07:35.150
and there was nothing that YouTube or Google

00:07:35.150 --> 00:07:38.150
were particularly privileged to do about it.

00:07:38.150 --> 00:07:42.150
And yet, somehow, within about two hours,

00:07:42.150 --> 00:07:44.150
the problem was fixed.

00:07:44.150 --> 00:07:46.150
How did this happen?

00:07:46.150 --> 00:07:49.150
Well, for a big clue, we turn to NANOG.

00:07:49.150 --> 00:07:52.150
The North American Network Operators Group,

00:07:52.150 --> 00:07:54.150
a group of people who,

00:07:54.150 --> 00:07:56.150
on a beautiful day outside,

00:07:56.150 --> 00:07:58.150
enter into a windowless room,

00:07:58.150 --> 00:08:00.150
at their terminals

00:08:00.150 --> 00:08:03.150
reading email and messages

00:08:03.150 --> 00:08:07.150
in fixed proportion font, like this,

00:08:07.150 --> 00:08:09.150
and they talk about networks.

00:08:09.150 --> 00:08:11.150
And some of them are mid-level employees at Internet service providers

00:08:11.150 --> 00:08:13.150
around the world.

00:08:13.150 --> 00:08:15.150
And here is the message where one of them says,

00:08:15.150 --> 00:08:18.150
"Looks like we've got a live one. We have a hijacking of YouTube!

00:08:18.150 --> 00:08:21.150
This is not a drill. It's not just the cluelessness

00:08:21.150 --> 00:08:23.150
of YouTube engineers. I promise.

00:08:23.150 --> 00:08:25.150
Something is up in Pakistan."

00:08:25.150 --> 00:08:29.150
And they came together to help find the problem and fix it.

00:08:29.150 --> 00:08:32.150
So it's kind of like if your house catches on fire.

00:08:32.150 --> 00:08:36.150
The bad news is there is no fire brigade.

00:08:36.150 --> 00:08:39.150
The good news is random people apparate from nowhere,

00:08:39.150 --> 00:08:43.150
put out the fire and leave without expecting payment or praise.

00:08:43.150 --> 00:08:48.150
(Applause)

00:08:48.150 --> 00:08:50.150
I was trying to think of the right model to describe

00:08:50.150 --> 00:08:52.150
this form of random acts of kindness

00:08:52.150 --> 00:08:54.150
by geeky strangers.

00:08:54.150 --> 00:08:59.150
(Laughter)

00:08:59.150 --> 00:09:02.150
You know, it's just like the hail goes out

00:09:02.150 --> 00:09:04.150
and people are ready to help.

00:09:04.150 --> 00:09:08.150
And it turns out this model is everywhere, once you start looking for it.

00:09:08.150 --> 00:09:11.150
Example number two: Wikipedia.

00:09:11.150 --> 00:09:14.150
If a man named Jimbo came up to you in 2001

00:09:14.150 --> 00:09:17.150
and said, "I've got a great idea! We start with seven articles

00:09:17.150 --> 00:09:19.150
that anybody can edit anything, at any time,

00:09:19.150 --> 00:09:22.150
and we'll get a great encyclopedia! Eh?"

00:09:22.150 --> 00:09:26.150
Right. Dumbest idea ever.

00:09:26.150 --> 00:09:27.150
(Laughter)

00:09:27.150 --> 00:09:32.150
In fact, Wikipedia is an idea so profoundly stupid

00:09:32.150 --> 00:09:35.150
that even Jimbo never had it.

00:09:35.150 --> 00:09:37.150
Jimbo's idea was for Nupedia.

00:09:37.150 --> 00:09:39.150
It was going to be totally traditional. He would pay people money

00:09:39.150 --> 00:09:41.150
because he was feeling like a good guy,

00:09:41.150 --> 00:09:43.150
and the money would go to the people

00:09:43.150 --> 00:09:45.150
and they would write the articles.

00:09:45.150 --> 00:09:47.150
The wiki was introduced

00:09:47.150 --> 00:09:49.150
so others could make suggestions on edits --

00:09:49.150 --> 00:09:51.150
as almost an afterthought, a back room.

00:09:51.150 --> 00:09:54.150
And then it turns out the back room grew

00:09:54.150 --> 00:09:56.150
to encompass the entire project.

00:09:56.150 --> 00:09:59.150
And today, Wikipedia is so ubiquitous

00:09:59.150 --> 00:10:03.150
that you can now find it on Chinese restaurant menus.

00:10:03.150 --> 00:10:09.150
(Laughter)

00:10:09.150 --> 00:10:11.150
I am not making this up.

00:10:11.150 --> 00:10:13.150
(Laughter)

00:10:13.150 --> 00:10:16.150
I have a theory I can explain later.

00:10:16.150 --> 00:10:18.150
Suffice it to say for now that I prefer my Wikipedia

00:10:18.150 --> 00:10:20.150
stir-fried with pimentos.

00:10:20.150 --> 00:10:22.150
(Laughter)

00:10:22.150 --> 00:10:25.150
But now, Wikipedia doesn't just spontaneously work.

00:10:25.150 --> 00:10:27.150
How does it really work? It turns out

00:10:27.150 --> 00:10:29.150
there is a back room that is kind of windowless,

00:10:29.150 --> 00:10:31.150
metaphorically speaking.

00:10:31.150 --> 00:10:33.150
And there are a bunch of people who, on a sunny day,

00:10:33.150 --> 00:10:36.150
would rather be inside

00:10:36.150 --> 00:10:38.150
and monitoring this, the administrator's notice board,

00:10:38.150 --> 00:10:41.150
itself a wiki page that anyone can edit.

00:10:41.150 --> 00:10:44.150
And you just bring your problems to the page.

00:10:44.150 --> 00:10:47.150
It's reminiscent of the description of history

00:10:47.150 --> 00:10:50.150
as "one damn thing after another," right?

00:10:50.150 --> 00:10:54.150
Number one: "Tendentious editing by user Andyvphil."

00:10:54.150 --> 00:10:57.150
Apologies, Andyvphil, if you're here today.

00:10:57.150 --> 00:10:59.150
I'm not taking sides.

00:10:59.150 --> 00:11:02.150
"Anon attacking me for reverting."

00:11:02.150 --> 00:11:04.150
Here is my favorite: "A long story."

00:11:04.150 --> 00:11:05.150
(Laughter)

00:11:05.150 --> 00:11:09.150
It turns out there are more people checking this page for problems

00:11:09.150 --> 00:11:11.150
and wanting to solve them

00:11:11.150 --> 00:11:14.150
than there are problems arising on the page.

00:11:14.150 --> 00:11:17.150
And that's what keeps Wikipedia afloat.

00:11:17.150 --> 00:11:20.150
At all times, Wikipedia is approximately

00:11:20.150 --> 00:11:25.150
45 minutes away from utter destruction. Right?

00:11:25.150 --> 00:11:27.150
There are spambots crawling it, trying to turn every article

00:11:27.150 --> 00:11:29.150
into an ad for a Rolex watch.

00:11:29.150 --> 00:11:30.150
(Laughter)

00:11:30.150 --> 00:11:33.150
It's this thin geeky line

00:11:33.150 --> 00:11:35.150
that keeps it going.

00:11:35.150 --> 00:11:37.150
Not because it's a job,

00:11:37.150 --> 00:11:39.150
not because it's a career,

00:11:39.150 --> 00:11:41.150
but because it's a calling.

00:11:41.150 --> 00:11:44.150
It's something they feel impelled to do

00:11:44.150 --> 00:11:46.150
because they care about it.

00:11:46.150 --> 00:11:48.150
They even gather together in such groups

00:11:48.150 --> 00:11:50.150
as the Counter-Vandalism Unit --

00:11:50.150 --> 00:11:53.150
"Civility, Maturity, Responsibility" --

00:11:53.150 --> 00:11:55.150
to just clean up the pages.

00:11:55.150 --> 00:11:58.150
It does make you wonder if there were, for instance,

00:11:58.150 --> 00:12:02.150
a massive, extremely popular Star Trek convention one weekend,

00:12:02.150 --> 00:12:04.150
who would be minding the store?

00:12:04.150 --> 00:12:09.150
(Laughter)

00:12:09.150 --> 00:12:11.150
So what we see --

00:12:11.150 --> 00:12:14.150
(Laughter)

00:12:14.150 --> 00:12:18.150
what we see in this phenomenon

00:12:18.150 --> 00:12:22.150
is something that the crazed, late traffic engineer

00:12:22.150 --> 00:12:24.150
Hans Monderman discovered in the Netherlands,

00:12:24.150 --> 00:12:26.150
and here in South Kensington, that sometimes

00:12:26.150 --> 00:12:31.150
if you remove some of the external rules and signs and everything else,

00:12:31.150 --> 00:12:33.150
you can actually end up

00:12:33.150 --> 00:12:36.150
with a safer environment in which people can function,

00:12:36.150 --> 00:12:39.150
and one in which they are more human with each other.

00:12:39.150 --> 00:12:41.150
They're realizing that they

00:12:41.150 --> 00:12:43.150
have to take responsibility for what they do.

00:12:43.150 --> 00:12:46.150
And Wikipedia has embraced this.

00:12:46.150 --> 00:12:49.150
Some of you may remember Star Wars Kid,

00:12:49.150 --> 00:12:53.150
the poor teenager who filmed himself with a golf ball retriever,

00:12:53.150 --> 00:12:55.150
acting as if it were a light saber.

00:12:55.150 --> 00:12:58.150
The film, without his permission or even knowledge at first,

00:12:58.150 --> 00:13:00.150
found its way onto the Internet.

00:13:00.150 --> 00:13:03.150
Hugely viral video. Extremely popular.

00:13:03.150 --> 00:13:06.150
Totally mortifying to him.

00:13:06.150 --> 00:13:08.150
Now, it being encyclopedic and all,

00:13:08.150 --> 00:13:11.150
Wikipedia had to do an article about Star Wars Kid.

00:13:11.150 --> 00:13:13.150
Every article on Wikipedia has a corresponding discussion page,

00:13:13.150 --> 00:13:15.150
and on the discussion page

00:13:15.150 --> 00:13:18.150
they had extensive argument among the Wikipedians

00:13:18.150 --> 00:13:22.150
as to whether to have his real name

00:13:22.150 --> 00:13:24.150
featured in the article.

00:13:24.150 --> 00:13:26.150
You could see arguments on both sides.

00:13:26.150 --> 00:13:28.150
Here is just a snapshot of some of them.

00:13:28.150 --> 00:13:30.150
They eventually decided --

00:13:30.150 --> 00:13:32.150
not unanimously by any means --

00:13:32.150 --> 00:13:34.150
not to include his real name,

00:13:34.150 --> 00:13:37.150
despite the fact that nearly all media reports did.

00:13:37.150 --> 00:13:40.150
They just didn't think it was the right thing to do.

00:13:40.150 --> 00:13:42.150
It was an act of kindness.

00:13:42.150 --> 00:13:44.150
And to this day, the page for Star Wars Kid

00:13:44.150 --> 00:13:46.150
has a warning right at the top

00:13:46.150 --> 00:13:49.150
that says you are not to put his real name on the page.

00:13:49.150 --> 00:13:51.150
If you do, it will be removed immediately,

00:13:51.150 --> 00:13:55.150
removed by people who may have disagreed with the original decision,

00:13:55.150 --> 00:13:58.150
but respect the outcome

00:13:58.150 --> 00:14:00.150
and work to make it stay

00:14:00.150 --> 00:14:04.150
because they believe in something bigger than their own opinion.

00:14:04.150 --> 00:14:07.150
As a lawyer, I've got to say these guys are inventing the law

00:14:07.150 --> 00:14:11.150
and stare decisis and stuff like that as they go along.

00:14:11.150 --> 00:14:14.150
Now, this isn't just limited to Wikipedia.

00:14:14.150 --> 00:14:16.150
We see it on blogs all over the place.

00:14:16.150 --> 00:14:19.150
I mean, this is a 2005 Business Week cover.

00:14:19.150 --> 00:14:21.150
Wow. Blogs are going to change your business.

00:14:21.150 --> 00:14:24.150
I know they look silly. And sure they look silly.

00:14:24.150 --> 00:14:26.150
They start off on all sorts of goofy projects.

00:14:26.150 --> 00:14:28.150
This is my favorite goofy blog:

00:14:28.150 --> 00:14:31.150
Catsthatlooklikehitler.com.

00:14:31.150 --> 00:14:32.150
(Laughter)

00:14:32.150 --> 00:14:35.150
You send in a picture of your cat

00:14:35.150 --> 00:14:37.150
if it looks like Hitler.

00:14:37.150 --> 00:14:44.150
(Laughter)

00:14:44.150 --> 00:14:46.150
Yeah, I know. Number four, it's like, can you imagine

00:14:46.150 --> 00:14:48.150
coming home to that cat everyday?

00:14:48.150 --> 00:14:49.150
(Laughter)

00:14:49.150 --> 00:14:53.150
But then, you can see the same kind of whimsy

00:14:53.150 --> 00:14:55.150
applied to people.

00:14:55.150 --> 00:14:59.150
So this is a blog devoted to unfortunate portraiture.

00:14:59.150 --> 00:15:02.150
This one says, "Bucolic meadow with split-rail fence.

00:15:02.150 --> 00:15:04.150
Is that an animal carcass behind her?"

00:15:04.150 --> 00:15:05.150
(Laughter)

00:15:05.150 --> 00:15:07.150
You're like, "You know? I think that's an animal carcass

00:15:07.150 --> 00:15:09.150
behind her."

00:15:09.150 --> 00:15:11.150
And it's one after the other.

00:15:11.150 --> 00:15:15.150
But then you hit this one. Image removed at request of owner.

00:15:15.150 --> 00:15:17.150
That's it. Image removed at request of owner.

00:15:17.150 --> 00:15:19.150
It turns out that somebody lampooned here

00:15:19.150 --> 00:15:22.150
wrote to the snarky guy that does the site,

00:15:22.150 --> 00:15:25.150
not with a legal threat, not with an offer of payment,

00:15:25.150 --> 00:15:27.150
but just said, "Hey, would you mind?"

00:15:27.150 --> 00:15:29.150
The person said, "No, that's fine."

00:15:29.150 --> 00:15:33.150
I believe we can build architectures online

00:15:33.150 --> 00:15:36.150
to make such human requests

00:15:36.150 --> 00:15:38.150
that much easier to do,

00:15:38.150 --> 00:15:40.150
to make it possible for all of us to see

00:15:40.150 --> 00:15:42.150
that the data we encounter online

00:15:42.150 --> 00:15:46.150
is just stuff on which to click and paste and copy and forward

00:15:46.150 --> 00:15:49.150
that actually represents human emotion

00:15:49.150 --> 00:15:51.150
and endeavor and impact,

00:15:51.150 --> 00:15:53.150
and to be able to have an ethical moment

00:15:53.150 --> 00:15:56.150
where we decide how we want to treat it.

00:15:56.150 --> 00:15:59.150
I even think it can go into the real world.

00:15:59.150 --> 00:16:02.150
We can end up, as we get in a world with more censors --

00:16:02.150 --> 00:16:05.150
everywhere there is something filming you, maybe putting it online --

00:16:05.150 --> 00:16:07.150
to be able to have a little clip you could wear

00:16:07.150 --> 00:16:09.150
that says, "You know, I'd rather not."

00:16:09.150 --> 00:16:12.150
And then have technology

00:16:12.150 --> 00:16:14.150
that the person taking the photo will know later,

00:16:14.150 --> 00:16:16.150
this person requested to be contacted

00:16:16.150 --> 00:16:18.150
before this goes anywhere big,

00:16:18.150 --> 00:16:20.150
if you don't mind.

00:16:20.150 --> 00:16:22.150
And that person taking the photo can make a decision

00:16:22.150 --> 00:16:26.150
about how and whether to respect it.

00:16:26.150 --> 00:16:28.150
In the real world, we see filtering of this sort

00:16:28.150 --> 00:16:30.150
taking place in Pakistan.

00:16:30.150 --> 00:16:34.150
And we now have means that we can build, like this system,

00:16:34.150 --> 00:16:37.150
so that people can report the filtering as they encounter it.

00:16:37.150 --> 00:16:41.150
And it's no longer just a "I don't know. I couldn't get there. I guess I'll move on,"

00:16:41.150 --> 00:16:43.150
but suddenly a collective consciousness

00:16:43.150 --> 00:16:46.150
about what is blocked and censored

00:16:46.150 --> 00:16:48.150
where online.

00:16:48.150 --> 00:16:52.150
In fact, talk about technology imitating life

00:16:52.150 --> 00:16:55.150
imitating tech, or maybe it's the other way around.

00:16:55.150 --> 00:16:58.150
An NYU researcher here took little cardboard robots

00:16:58.150 --> 00:17:00.150
with smiley faces on them,

00:17:00.150 --> 00:17:03.150
and a motor that just drove them forward

00:17:03.150 --> 00:17:05.150
and a flag sticking out the back

00:17:05.150 --> 00:17:07.150
with a desired destination.

00:17:07.150 --> 00:17:09.150
It said, "Can you help me get there?"

00:17:09.150 --> 00:17:13.150
Released it on the streets of Manhattan.

00:17:13.150 --> 00:17:15.150
(Laughter)

00:17:15.150 --> 00:17:18.150
They'll fund anything these days.

00:17:18.150 --> 00:17:20.150
Here is the chart of over 43 people

00:17:20.150 --> 00:17:23.150
helping to steer the robot that could not steer

00:17:23.150 --> 00:17:25.150
and get it on its way, from one corner

00:17:25.150 --> 00:17:27.150
from one corner of Washington Square Park

00:17:27.150 --> 00:17:29.150
to another.

00:17:29.150 --> 00:17:33.150
That leads to example number three: hitchhiking.

00:17:33.150 --> 00:17:36.150
I'm not so sure hitchhiking is dead.

00:17:36.150 --> 00:17:40.150
Why? There is the Craigslist rideshare board.

00:17:40.150 --> 00:17:43.150
If it were called the Craigslist hitchhiking board,

00:17:43.150 --> 00:17:45.150
tumbleweeds would be blowing through it.

00:17:45.150 --> 00:17:48.150
But it's the rideshare board, and it's basically the same thing.

00:17:48.150 --> 00:17:50.150
Now why are people using it?

00:17:50.150 --> 00:17:53.150
I don't know. Maybe they think that, uh, killers don't plan ahead?

00:17:53.150 --> 00:17:59.150
(Laughter)

00:17:59.150 --> 00:18:01.150
No. I think the actual answer is

00:18:01.150 --> 00:18:03.150
that once you reframe it,

00:18:03.150 --> 00:18:06.150
once you get out of one set of stale expectations

00:18:06.150 --> 00:18:09.150
from a failed project that had its day,

00:18:09.150 --> 00:18:11.150
but now, for whatever reason, is tarnished,

00:18:11.150 --> 00:18:15.150
you can actually rekindle the kind of human kindness and sharing

00:18:15.150 --> 00:18:18.150
that something like this on Craigslist represents.

00:18:18.150 --> 00:18:20.150
And then you can highlight it

00:18:20.150 --> 00:18:22.150
into something like,

00:18:22.150 --> 00:18:25.150
yes, CouchSurfing.org.

00:18:25.150 --> 00:18:28.150
CouchSurfing: one guy's idea

00:18:28.150 --> 00:18:31.150
to, at last, put together people who are going somewhere far away

00:18:31.150 --> 00:18:36.150
and would like to sleep on a stranger's couch for free,

00:18:36.150 --> 00:18:38.150
with people who live far away,

00:18:38.150 --> 00:18:42.150
and would like someone they don't know to sleep on their couch for free.

00:18:42.150 --> 00:18:46.150
It's a brilliant idea.

00:18:46.150 --> 00:18:48.150
It's a bee that, yes, flies.

00:18:48.150 --> 00:18:51.150
Amazing how many successful couch surfings there have been.

00:18:51.150 --> 00:18:55.150
And if you're wondering, no, there have been no known fatalities

00:18:55.150 --> 00:18:57.150
associated with CouchSurfing.

00:18:57.150 --> 00:19:00.150
Although, to be sure, the reputation system, at the moment,

00:19:00.150 --> 00:19:03.150
works that you leave your report after the couch surfing experience,

00:19:03.150 --> 00:19:06.150
so there may be some selection bias there.

00:19:06.150 --> 00:19:10.150
(Laughter)

00:19:10.150 --> 00:19:14.150
So, my urging, my thought,

00:19:14.150 --> 00:19:17.150
is that the Internet isn't just a pile of information.

00:19:17.150 --> 00:19:20.150
It's not a noun. It's a verb.

00:19:20.150 --> 00:19:22.150
And when you go on it,

00:19:22.150 --> 00:19:26.150
if you listen and see carefully and closely enough,

00:19:26.150 --> 00:19:28.150
what you will discover

00:19:28.150 --> 00:19:30.150
is that that information

00:19:30.150 --> 00:19:32.150
is saying something to you.

00:19:32.150 --> 00:19:34.150
What it's saying to you is what we heard yesterday,

00:19:34.150 --> 00:19:37.150
Demosthenes was saying to us.

00:19:37.150 --> 00:19:41.150
It's saying, "Let's march." Thank you very much.

00:19:41.150 --> 00:19:43.150
(Applause)
