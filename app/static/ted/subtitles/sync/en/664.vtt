00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:14.150
Twenty-five-and-a-quarter years ago I read

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:16.150
a newspaper article which said

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:19.150
that one day syringes would be

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:21.150
one of the major causes of the spread of AIDS,

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.150
the transmission of AIDS.

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:27.150
I thought this was unacceptable. So I decided to do something about it.

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.150
Sadly, it's come true. Malaria, as we all know,

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:33.150
kills approximately one million people a year.

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:35.150
The reuse of syringes now exceeds that

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:40.150
and kills 1.3 million people a year.

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:42.150
This young girl and her friend

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:44.150
that I met in an orphanage in Delhi

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:49.150
were HIV positive from a syringe.

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:52.150
And what was so sad about this particular story

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:55.150
was that once their parents had found out --

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:59.150
and don't forget, their parents took them to the doctor --

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:01.150
the parents threw them out on the street.

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:04.150
And hence they ended up in an orphanage.

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:06.150
And it comes from situations like this where

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.150
you have either skilled or unskilled practitioners,

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.150
blindly giving an injection to someone.

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.150
And the injection is so valuable,

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.150
that the people basically trust

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:20.150
the doctor, being second to God, which I've heard many times,

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:23.150
to do the right thing. But in fact they're not.

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:25.150
And you can understand, obviously, the transmission problem

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:29.150
between people in high-virus areas.

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:31.150
This video we took undercover,

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:33.150
which shows you, over a half an hour period,

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:37.150
a tray of medicines of 42 vials,

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:42.150
which are being delivered with only 2 syringes in a public hospital in India.

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.150
And over the course of half an hour, not one syringe

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:46.150
was filmed being unwrapped.

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:49.150
They started with two and they ended with two.

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:52.150
And you'll see, just now, a nurse coming back to the tray,

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:55.150
which is their sort of modular station,

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:58.150
and dropping the syringe she's just used

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:01.150
back in the tray for it to be picked up and used again.

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:04.150
So you can imagine the scale of this problem.

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:06.150
And in fact in India alone, 62 percent

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:08.150
of all injections given

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:10.150
are unsafe.

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:12.150
These kids in Pakistan don't go to school.

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:14.150
They are lucky. They already have a job.

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:16.150
And that job is that they go around and pick up syringes

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:18.150
from the back of hospitals,

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:20.150
wash them, and in the course of this,

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:23.150
obviously picking them up they injure themselves.

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:26.150
And then they repackage them and sell them out on markets

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:28.150
for literally more money

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:31.150
than a sterile syringe in the first place, which is quite bizarre.

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:34.150
In an interesting photo, their father, while we were talking to him,

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:36.150
picked up a syringe and pricked his finger --

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:39.150
I don't know whether you can see the drop of blood on the end --

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:42.150
and immediately whipped out a box of matches,

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:45.150
lit one, and burned the blood off the end of his finger,

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:47.150
giving me full assurance

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:51.150
that that was the way that you stopped the transmission of HIV.

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:55.150
In China, recycling is a major issue.

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:58.150
And they are collected en mass -- you can see the scale of it here --

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:02.150
and sorted out, by hand, back into the right sizes,

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:04.150
and then put back out on the street.

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:07.150
So recycling and reuse

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:09.150
are the major issues here.

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:12.150
But there was one interesting anecdote that I found in Indonesia.

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:14.150
In all schools in Indonesia,

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:16.150
there is usually a toy seller in the playground.

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:18.150
The toy seller, in this case,

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:20.150
had syringes, which they usually do,

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:22.150
next door to the diggers, which is obviously

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:24.150
what you would expect.

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:26.150
And they use them, in the breaks, for water pistols.

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:28.150
They squirt them at each other, which is lovely and innocent.

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:30.150
And they are having great fun.

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:32.150
But they also drink from them

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:34.150
while they're in their breaks, because it's hot.

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:37.150
And they squirt the water into their mouths.

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:42.150
And these are used with traces of blood visible.

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:44.150
So we need a better product. And we need better information.

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:49.150
And I think, if I can just borrow this camera,

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:51.150
I was going to show you my invention,

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:54.150
which I came up with.

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:56.150
So, it's a normal-looking syringe.

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:58.150
You load it up in the normal way. This is made

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:02.150
on existing equipment in 14 factories that we license.

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:05.150
You give the injection and then put it down.

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:07.150
If someone then tries to reuse it,

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:09.150
it locks and breaks afterwards.

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:11.150
It's very, very simple. Thank you.

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:14.150
(Applause)

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:16.150
And it costs the same as a normal syringe.

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:18.150
And in comparison, a Coca-Cola

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:20.150
is 10 times the price.

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:23.150
And that will stop reusing a syringe 20 or 30 times.

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:25.150
And I have an information charity

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:29.150
which has done huge scale amount of work in India.

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:32.150
And we're very proud of giving information to people,

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:34.150
so that little kids like this don't do stupid things.

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:36.150
Thank you very much.

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:37.150
(Applause)
