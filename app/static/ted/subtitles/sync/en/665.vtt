00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.150
The future, as we know it, is very unpredictable.

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:18.150
The best minds in the best institutions

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:20.150
generally get it wrong.

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:24.150
This is in technology. This is in the area of politics,

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.150
where pundits, the CIA, MI6 always get it wrong.

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.150
And it's clearly in the area of finance.

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.150
With institutions established to think about the future,

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:36.150
the IMF, the BIS, the Financial Stability Forum, couldn't see what was coming.

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:38.150
Over 20,000 economists

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:40.150
whose job it is, competitive entry to get there,

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:42.150
couldn't see what was happening.

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:44.150
Globalization is getting more complex.

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:46.150
And this change is getting more rapid.

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:48.150
The future will be more unpredictable.

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:50.150
Urbanization, integration,

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:53.150
coming together, leads to a new renaissance.

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:55.150
It did this a thousand years ago.

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:58.150
The last 40 years have been extraordinary times.

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:01.150
Life expectancy has gone up by about 25 years.

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:04.150
It took from the Stone Age to achieve that.

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:06.150
Income has gone up for a majority of the world's population,

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:11.150
despite the population going up by about two billion people over this period.

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:14.150
And illiteracy has gone down, from a half to about a quarter of the people on Earth.

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:17.150
A huge opportunity, unleashing of new potential

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:19.150
for innovation, for development.

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:21.150
But there is an underbelly.

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:24.150
There are two Achilles' heels of globalization.

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.150
There is the Achilles' heel of growing inequality --

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:29.150
those that are left out, those that feel angry,

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:31.150
those that are not participating. Globalization

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:33.150
has not been inclusive.

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:36.150
The second Achilles' heel is complexity --

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:40.150
a growing fragility, a growing brittleness.

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:43.150
What happens in one place very quickly affects everything else.

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:46.150
This is a systemic risk, systemic shock.

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:49.150
We've seen it in the financial crisis. We've seen it in the pandemic flu.

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:53.150
It will become virulent and it's something we have to build resilience against.

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:56.150
A lot of this is driven by what's happening in technology.

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:59.150
There have been huge leaps. There will be a million-fold improvement

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:01.150
in what you can get for the same price

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:03.150
in computing by 2030.

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:05.150
That's what the experience of the last 20 years has been.

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:07.150
It will continue.

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:10.150
Our computers, our systems will be as primitive

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:12.150
as the Apollo's are for today.

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:15.150
Our mobile phones are more powerful than the total Apollo space engine.

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:17.150
Our mobile phones are more powerful than

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:19.150
some of the strongest computers of 20 years ago.

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:21.150
So what will this do?

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:24.150
It will create huge opportunities in technology.

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:26.150
Miniaturization as well.

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:29.150
There will be invisible capacity. Invisible capacity in our bodies,

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:31.150
in our brains, and in the air.

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:34.150
This is a dust mite on a nanoreplica.

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:38.150
This sort of ability to do everything in new ways unleashes potential,

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:40.150
not least in the area of medicine.

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:43.150
This is a stem cell that we've developed here in Oxford,

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:45.150
from an embryonic stem cell.

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:47.150
We can develop any part of the body.

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:50.150
Increasingly, over time, this will be possible from our own skin --

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:52.150
able to replicate parts of the body.

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:54.150
Fantastic potential for regenerative medicine.

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:58.150
I don't think there will be a Special Olympics long after 2030,

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:01.150
because of this capacity to regenerate parts of the body.

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:03.150
But the question is, "Who will have it?"

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:05.150
The other major development is going to be

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:07.150
in the area of what can happen in genetics.

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:13.150
The capacity to create, as this mouse has been genetically modified,

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:15.150
something which goes three times faster,

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:17.150
lasts for three times longer, we could produce,

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:21.150
as this mouse can, to the age of our equivalent of 80 years,

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:24.150
using about the same amount of food.

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:26.150
But will this only be available for the super rich,

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:29.150
for those that can afford it? Are we headed for a new eugenics?

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:32.150
Will only those that are able to afford it

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:35.150
be able to be this super race of the future?

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:36.150
(Laughter)

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:38.150
So the big question for us is,

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:40.150
"How do we manage this technological change?"

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:42.150
How do we ensure that it creates

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:44.150
a more inclusive technology,

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:47.150
a technology which means

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:49.150
that not only as we grow older,

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:51.150
that we can also grow wiser, and that we're able to support

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:53.150
the populations of the future?

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:56.150
One of the most dramatic manifestations of these improvements

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:58.150
will be moving from population pyramids

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:01.150
to what we might term population coffins.

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:03.150
There is unlikely to be a pension

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:06.150
or a retirement age in 2030.

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:09.150
These will be redundant concepts. And this isn't only something of the West.

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:12.150
The most dramatic changes will be the skyscraper

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:14.150
type of new pyramids

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:17.150
that will take place in China and in many other countries.

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:19.150
So forget about retirements if you're young.

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:22.150
Forget about pensions. Think about life and where it's going to be going.

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:25.150
Of course, migration will become even more important.

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:27.150
The war on talent, the need to attract people

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:29.150
at all skill ranges,

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:31.150
to push us around in our wheelchairs,

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:34.150
but also to drive our economies. Our innovation will be vital.

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:36.150
The employment in the rich countries

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:38.150
will go down from about 800

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:40.150
to about 700 million of these people.

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:42.150
This would imply a massive leap in migration.

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:45.150
So the concerns, the xenophobic concerns of today,

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:47.150
of migration, will be turned on their head,

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:50.150
as we search for people to help us sort out

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:52.150
our pensions and our economies in the future.

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:54.150
And then, the systemic risks.

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:57.150
We understand that these will become much more virulent,

00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:59.150
that what we see today

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:02.150
is this interweaving of societies, of systems,

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:07.150
fastened by technologies and hastened by just-in-time management systems.

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:12.150
Small levels of stock push resilience into other people's responsibility.

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:14.150
The collapse in biodiversity,

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:17.150
climate change, pandemics, financial crises:

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:20.150
these will be the currency that we will think about.

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:22.150
And so a new awareness will have to arise,

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:25.150
of how we deal with these, how we mobilize ourselves,

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:28.150
in a new way, and come together as a community

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:30.150
to manage systemic risk.

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:32.150
It's going to require innovation.

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:36.150
It's going to require an understanding that the glory of globalization

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:38.150
could also be its downfall.

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:41.150
This could be our best century ever because of the achievements,

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:43.150
or it could be our worst.

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:45.150
And of course we need to worry about the individuals,

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:47.150
particularly the individuals that feel that they've

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:49.150
been left out in one way or another.

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:52.150
An individual, for the first time in the history of humanity,

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:54.150
will have the capacity, by 2030,

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:57.150
to destroy the planet, to wreck everything,

00:05:57.150 --> 00:06:00.150
through the creation, for example, of a biopathogen.

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:02.150
How do we begin to weave these tapestries together?

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:05.150
How do we think about complex systems in new ways?

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:07.150
That will be the challenge of the scholars,

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:10.150
and of all of us engaged in thinking about the future.

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:13.150
The rest of our lives will be in the future. We need to prepare for it now.

00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:16.150
We need to understand that the governance structure in the world is fossilized.

00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:20.150
It cannot begin to cope with the challenges that this will bring.

00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:23.150
We have to develop a new way of managing the planet,

00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:25.150
collectively, through collective wisdom.

00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:27.150
We know, and I know from my own experience,

00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:29.150
that amazing things can happen,

00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:31.150
when individuals and societies come together

00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:33.150
to change their future.

00:06:33.150 --> 00:06:35.150
I left South Africa, and 15 years later,

00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:37.150
after thinking I would never go back,

00:06:37.150 --> 00:06:40.150
I had the privilege and the honor to work in the government of Nelson Mandela.

00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:42.150
This was a miracle. We can create miracles,

00:06:42.150 --> 00:06:44.150
collectively, in our lifetime.

00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:46.150
It is vital that we do so.

00:06:46.150 --> 00:06:48.150
It is vital that the ideas that are nurtured in TED,

00:06:48.150 --> 00:06:50.150
that the ideas that we think about

00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:53.150
look forward, and make sure that this will be the most glorious century,

00:06:53.150 --> 00:06:56.150
and not one of eco-disaster and eco-collapse.

00:06:56.150 --> 00:06:58.150
Thank you. (Applause)
