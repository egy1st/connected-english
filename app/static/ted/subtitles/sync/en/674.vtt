00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:23.150
A human child is born,

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:28.150
and for quite a long time

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:33.150
is a consumer.

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:45.150
It cannot be consciously a contributor.

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:47.150
It is helpless.

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:50.150
It doesn't know how to survive,

00:00:50.150 --> 00:01:05.150
even though it is endowed with an instinct to survive.

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:21.150
It needs the help of mother, or a foster mother, to survive.

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:34.150
It can't afford to doubt the person who tends the child.

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:39.150
It has to totally surrender,

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:44.150
as one surrenders to an anesthesiologist.

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:50.150
It has to totally surrender.

00:01:50.150 --> 00:02:00.150
That implies a lot of trust.

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:07.150
That implies the trusted person

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:10.150
won't violate the trust.

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:15.150
As the child grows,

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:19.150
it begins to discover

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:25.150
that the person trusted is violating the trust.

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:30.150
It doesn't know even the word "violation."

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:36.150
Therefore, it has to blame itself,

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:39.150
a wordless blame,

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:51.150
which is more difficult to really resolve --

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:57.150
the wordless self-blame.

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:02.150
As the child grows to become an adult:

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:06.150
so far, it has been a consumer,

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:09.150
but the growth of a human being

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:19.150
lies in his or her capacity to contribute,

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:23.150
to be a contributor.

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:29.150
One cannot contribute unless one feels secure,

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:32.150
one feels big,

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:38.150
one feels: I have enough.

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:42.150
To be compassionate is not a joke.

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:45.150
It's not that simple.

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:52.150
One has to discover a certain bigness in oneself.

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:55.150
That bigness should be centered on oneself,

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:58.150
not in terms of money,

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:02.150
not in terms of power you wield,

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:10.150
not in terms of any status that you can command in the society,

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:15.150
but it should be centered on oneself.

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:19.150
The self: you are self-aware.

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:26.150
On that self, it should be centered -- a bigness, a wholeness.

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:33.150
Otherwise, compassion is just a word and a dream.

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:41.150
You can be compassionate occasionally,

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:45.150
more moved by empathy

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:52.150
than by compassion.

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:56.150
Thank God we are empathetic.

00:04:56.150 --> 00:05:01.150
When somebody's in pain, we pick up the pain.

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:08.150
In a Wimbledon final match,

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:11.150
these two guys fight it out.

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:16.150
Each one has got two games.

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:19.150
It can be anybody's game.

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:26.150
What they have sweated so far has no meaning.

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:32.150
One person wins.

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:42.150
The tennis etiquette is, both the players have to come to the net

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:47.150
and shake hands.

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:50.150
The winner boxes the air

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:55.150
and kisses the ground,

00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:59.150
throws his shirt as though somebody is waiting for it.

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:02.150
(Laughter)

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:06.150
And this guy has to come to the net.

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:09.150
When he comes to the net,

00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:14.150
you see, his whole face changes.

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:19.150
It looks as though he's wishing that he didn't win.

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:24.150
Why? Empathy.

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:26.150
That's human heart.

00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:32.150
No human heart is denied of that empathy.

00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:38.150
No religion can demolish that by indoctrination.

00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:44.150
No culture, no nation and nationalism --

00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:47.150
nothing can touch it

00:06:47.150 --> 00:06:50.150
because it is empathy.

00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:56.150
And that capacity to empathize

00:06:56.150 --> 00:07:04.150
is the window through which you reach out to people,

00:07:04.150 --> 00:07:09.150
you do something that makes a difference in somebody's life --

00:07:09.150 --> 00:07:14.150
even words, even time.

00:07:14.150 --> 00:07:19.150
Compassion is not defined in one form.

00:07:19.150 --> 00:07:22.150
There's no Indian compassion.

00:07:22.150 --> 00:07:26.150
There's no American compassion.

00:07:26.150 --> 00:07:32.150
It transcends nation, the gender, the age.

00:07:32.150 --> 00:07:43.150
Why? Because it is there in everybody.

00:07:43.150 --> 00:07:50.150
It's experienced by people occasionally.

00:07:50.150 --> 00:07:55.150
Then this occasional compassion,

00:07:55.150 --> 00:07:59.150
we are not talking about --

00:07:59.150 --> 00:08:02.150
it will never remain occasional.

00:08:02.150 --> 00:08:07.150
By mandate, you cannot make a person compassionate.

00:08:10.150 --> 00:08:14.150
You can't say, "Please love me."

00:08:14.150 --> 00:08:17.150
Love is something you discover.

00:08:17.150 --> 00:08:22.150
It's not an action,

00:08:22.150 --> 00:08:27.150
but in the English language, it is also an action.

00:08:27.150 --> 00:08:31.150
I will come to it later.

00:08:31.150 --> 00:08:38.150
So one has got to discover a certain wholeness.

00:08:38.150 --> 00:08:45.150
I am going to cite the possibility of being whole,

00:08:45.150 --> 00:08:52.150
which is within our experience, everybody's experience.

00:08:52.150 --> 00:09:01.150
In spite of a very tragic life,

00:09:01.150 --> 00:09:11.150
one is happy in moments which are very few and far between.

00:09:11.150 --> 00:09:14.150
And the one who is happy,

00:09:14.150 --> 00:09:22.150
even for a slapstick joke,

00:09:22.150 --> 00:09:31.150
accepts himself and also the scheme of things in which one finds oneself.

00:09:31.150 --> 00:09:35.150
That means the whole universe,

00:09:35.150 --> 00:09:39.150
known things and unknown things.

00:09:39.150 --> 00:09:45.150
All of them are totally accepted

00:09:45.150 --> 00:09:51.150
because you discover your wholeness in yourself.

00:09:51.150 --> 00:09:55.150
The subject -- "me" --

00:09:55.150 --> 00:09:58.150
and the object -- the scheme of things --

00:09:58.150 --> 00:10:03.150
fuse into oneness,

00:10:03.150 --> 00:10:09.150
an experience nobody can say, "I am denied of,"

00:10:09.150 --> 00:10:15.150
an experience common to all and sundry.

00:10:15.150 --> 00:10:24.150
That experience confirms that, in spite of all your limitations --

00:10:24.150 --> 00:10:29.150
all your wants, desires, unfulfilled, and the credit cards

00:10:29.150 --> 00:10:34.150
and layoffs

00:10:34.150 --> 00:10:38.150
and, finally, baldness --

00:10:38.150 --> 00:10:42.150
you can be happy.

00:10:42.150 --> 00:10:47.150
But the extension of the logic is

00:10:47.150 --> 00:10:53.150
that you don't need to fulfill your desire to be happy.

00:10:53.150 --> 00:10:59.150
You are the very happiness, the wholeness that you want to be.

00:10:59.150 --> 00:11:01.150
There's no choice in this:

00:11:01.150 --> 00:11:07.150
that only confirms the reality

00:11:07.150 --> 00:11:14.150
that the wholeness cannot be different from you,

00:11:14.150 --> 00:11:18.150
cannot be minus you.

00:11:18.150 --> 00:11:21.150
It has got to be you.

00:11:21.150 --> 00:11:24.150
You cannot be a part of wholeness

00:11:24.150 --> 00:11:27.150
and still be whole.

00:11:27.150 --> 00:11:31.150
Your moment of happiness reveals that reality,

00:11:31.150 --> 00:11:36.150
that realization, that recognition:

00:11:36.150 --> 00:11:39.150
"Maybe I am the whole.

00:11:39.150 --> 00:11:42.150
Maybe the swami is right.

00:11:42.150 --> 00:11:53.150
Maybe the swami is right." You start your new life.

00:11:53.150 --> 00:11:59.150
Then everything becomes meaningful.

00:11:59.150 --> 00:12:03.150
I have no more reason to blame myself.

00:12:03.150 --> 00:12:09.150
If one has to blame oneself, one has a million reasons plus many.

00:12:09.150 --> 00:12:15.150
But if I say, in spite of my body being limited --

00:12:15.150 --> 00:12:24.150
if it is black it is not white, if it is white it is not black:

00:12:24.150 --> 00:12:30.150
body is limited any which way you look at it. Limited.

00:12:30.150 --> 00:12:34.150
Your knowledge is limited, health is limited,

00:12:34.150 --> 00:12:37.150
and power is therefore limited,

00:12:37.150 --> 00:12:42.150
and the cheerfulness is going to be limited.

00:12:42.150 --> 00:12:45.150
Compassion is going to be limited.

00:12:45.150 --> 00:12:50.150
Everything is going to be limitless.

00:12:50.150 --> 00:12:56.150
You cannot command compassion

00:12:56.150 --> 00:13:00.150
unless you become limitless, and nobody can become limitless,

00:13:00.150 --> 00:13:05.150
either you are or you are not. Period.

00:13:05.150 --> 00:13:14.150
And there is no way of your being not limitless too.

00:13:14.150 --> 00:13:24.150
Your own experience reveals, in spite of all limitations, you are the whole.

00:13:24.150 --> 00:13:29.150
And the wholeness is the reality of you

00:13:29.150 --> 00:13:31.150
when you relate to the world.

00:13:31.150 --> 00:13:34.150
It is love first.

00:13:34.150 --> 00:13:36.150
When you relate to the world,

00:13:36.150 --> 00:13:41.150
the dynamic manifestation of the wholeness

00:13:41.150 --> 00:13:46.150
is, what we say, love.

00:13:46.150 --> 00:13:50.150
And itself becomes compassion

00:13:50.150 --> 00:14:01.150
if the object that you relate to evokes that emotion.

00:14:01.150 --> 00:14:11.150
Then that again transforms into giving, into sharing.

00:14:11.150 --> 00:14:17.150
You express yourself because you have compassion.

00:14:17.150 --> 00:14:23.150
To discover compassion, you need to be compassionate.

00:14:23.150 --> 00:14:28.150
To discover the capacity to give and share,

00:14:28.150 --> 00:14:30.150
you need to be giving and sharing.

00:14:30.150 --> 00:14:35.150
There is no shortcut: it is like swimming by swimming.

00:14:35.150 --> 00:14:39.150
You learn swimming by swimming.

00:14:39.150 --> 00:14:43.150
You cannot learn swimming on a foam mattress and enter into water.

00:14:43.150 --> 00:14:45.150
(Laughter)

00:14:45.150 --> 00:14:49.150
You learn swimming by swimming. You learn cycling by cycling.

00:14:49.150 --> 00:14:51.150
You learn cooking by cooking,

00:14:51.150 --> 00:14:54.150
having some sympathetic people around you

00:14:54.150 --> 00:14:56.150
to eat what you cook.

00:14:56.150 --> 00:14:59.150
(Laughter)

00:15:04.150 --> 00:15:08.150
And, therefore, what I say,

00:15:08.150 --> 00:15:10.150
you have to fake it and make it.

00:15:10.150 --> 00:15:17.150
(Laughter)

00:15:17.150 --> 00:15:20.150
You need to.

00:15:20.150 --> 00:15:26.150
My predecessor meant that.

00:15:26.150 --> 00:15:31.150
You have to act it out.

00:15:31.150 --> 00:15:38.150
You have to act compassionately.

00:15:38.150 --> 00:15:43.150
There is no verb for compassion,

00:15:43.150 --> 00:15:47.150
but you have an adverb for compassion.

00:15:47.150 --> 00:15:51.150
That's interesting to me.

00:15:51.150 --> 00:15:57.150
You act compassionately.

00:15:57.150 --> 00:16:01.150
But then, how to act compassionately if you don't have compassion?

00:16:01.150 --> 00:16:04.150
That is where you fake.

00:16:04.150 --> 00:16:08.150
You fake it and make it. This is the mantra of the United States of America.

00:16:08.150 --> 00:16:13.150
(Laughter)

00:16:13.150 --> 00:16:17.150
You fake it and make it.

00:16:17.150 --> 00:16:20.150
You act compassionately as though you have compassion:

00:16:20.150 --> 00:16:23.150
grind your teeth,

00:16:23.150 --> 00:16:25.150
take all the support system.

00:16:25.150 --> 00:16:29.150
If you know how to pray, pray.

00:16:29.150 --> 00:16:32.150
Ask for compassion.

00:16:32.150 --> 00:16:35.150
Let me act compassionately.

00:16:35.150 --> 00:16:37.150
Do it.

00:16:37.150 --> 00:16:39.150
You'll discover compassion

00:16:39.150 --> 00:16:44.150
and also slowly a relative compassion,

00:16:44.150 --> 00:16:48.150
and slowly, perhaps if you get the right teaching,

00:16:48.150 --> 00:16:53.150
you'll discover compassion is a dynamic manifestation

00:16:53.150 --> 00:16:59.150
of the reality of yourself, which is oneness, wholeness,

00:16:59.150 --> 00:17:01.150
and that's what you are.

00:17:01.150 --> 00:17:04.150
With these words, thank you very much.

00:17:04.150 --> 00:17:06.150
(Applause)
