00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:16.546
I'd like to talk to you today
about the scale of the scientific effort

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:19.250
that goes into making the headlines
you see in the paper.

00:00:19.274 --> 00:00:22.623
Headlines that look like this
when they have to do with climate change;

00:00:22.647 --> 00:00:25.493
and like this when they have to do
with air quality or smog.

00:00:25.517 --> 00:00:28.457
They're two branches of the same field
of atmospheric science.

00:00:28.481 --> 00:00:30.413
Recently, the headlines looked like this

00:00:30.437 --> 00:00:33.279
when the Intergovernmental Panel
on Climate Change, or IPCC,

00:00:33.303 --> 00:00:34.454
put out their report

00:00:34.478 --> 00:00:37.115
on the state of understanding
of the atmospheric system.

00:00:37.139 --> 00:00:40.120
That report was written
by 620 scientists from 40 countries.

00:00:40.144 --> 00:00:42.645
They wrote almost
1,000 pages on the topic,

00:00:42.669 --> 00:00:44.413
and all of those pages were reviewed

00:00:44.437 --> 00:00:46.564
by another 400-plus
scientists and reviewers

00:00:46.588 --> 00:00:48.282
from 113 countries.

00:00:48.306 --> 00:00:49.572
It's a big community;

00:00:49.596 --> 00:00:51.054
such a big community, in fact,

00:00:51.078 --> 00:00:54.533
that our annual gathering is the largest
scientific meeting in the world.

00:00:54.557 --> 00:00:57.511
Over 15,000 scientists go
to San Francisco every year for that.

00:00:57.535 --> 00:01:00.142
Every one of those scientists
is in a research group,

00:01:00.166 --> 00:01:02.895
and every research group studies
a wide variety of topics.

00:01:02.919 --> 00:01:05.893
For us at Cambridge, it's as varied
as the El NiÃ±o Oscillation,

00:01:05.917 --> 00:01:07.581
which affects weather and climate,

00:01:07.605 --> 00:01:09.437
to the assimilation of satellite data,

00:01:09.461 --> 00:01:12.720
to emissions from crops that produce
biofuels, which is what I study.

00:01:12.744 --> 00:01:16.062
And in each one of these research areas,
of which there are even more,

00:01:16.086 --> 00:01:19.446
there are PhD students, like me,
and we study incredibly narrow topics,

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.067
things as narrow as a few processes
or a few molecules.

00:01:22.091 --> 00:01:25.305
And one of the molecules I study
is called isoprene, which is here.

00:01:25.329 --> 00:01:26.976
It's a small organic molecule.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.644
You've probably never heard of it.

00:01:28.668 --> 00:01:31.070
The weight of a paper clip
is approximately equal

00:01:31.094 --> 00:01:34.725
to 900 zeta-illion -- 10 to the 21st --
molecules of isoprene.

00:01:34.749 --> 00:01:36.848
But despite its very small weight,

00:01:36.872 --> 00:01:39.428
enough of it is emitted
into the atmosphere every year

00:01:39.452 --> 00:01:41.928
to equal the weight
of all the people on the planet.

00:01:41.952 --> 00:01:45.009
It's a huge amount of stuff.
It's equal to the weight of methane.

00:01:45.033 --> 00:01:46.514
And because it's so much stuff,

00:01:46.538 --> 00:01:48.852
it's really important
for the atmospheric system.

00:01:48.876 --> 00:01:51.172
Because it's important
to the atmospheric system,

00:01:51.196 --> 00:01:53.153
we go to all lengths to study this thing.

00:01:53.177 --> 00:01:54.948
We blow it up and look at the pieces.

00:01:54.972 --> 00:01:56.980
This is the EUPHORE Smog Chamber in Spain.

00:01:57.004 --> 00:01:59.028
Atmospheric explosions,
or full combustion,

00:01:59.052 --> 00:02:01.962
takes about 15,000 times longer
than what happens in your car.

00:02:01.986 --> 00:02:03.566
But still, we look at the pieces.

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:06.935
We run enormous models on supercomputers;
this is what I happen to do.

00:02:06.959 --> 00:02:09.454
Our models have hundreds
of thousands of grid boxes

00:02:09.478 --> 00:02:12.485
calculating hundreds of variables
each, on minute timescales.

00:02:12.509 --> 00:02:14.565
It takes weeks to perform
our integrations,

00:02:14.589 --> 00:02:18.303
and we perform dozens of integrations
in order to understand what's happening.

00:02:18.327 --> 00:02:21.096
We also fly all over the world
looking for this thing.

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:24.301
I recently joined a field campaign
in Malaysia -- there are others.

00:02:24.325 --> 00:02:26.524
We found a global atmospheric
watchtower there

00:02:26.548 --> 00:02:28.102
in the middle of the rainforest,

00:02:28.126 --> 00:02:31.529
and hung hundreds of thousands
of dollars' worth of scientific equipment

00:02:31.553 --> 00:02:32.704
off this tower,

00:02:32.728 --> 00:02:35.494
to look for isoprene and other things
while we were there.

00:02:35.518 --> 00:02:38.393
This is the tower in the middle
of the rainforest from above,

00:02:38.417 --> 00:02:39.617
and the tower from below.

00:02:39.641 --> 00:02:42.832
On part of that field campaign
we even brought an aircraft with us.

00:02:42.856 --> 00:02:45.523
And this plane, the model BAe-146,
which was run by FAAM,

00:02:45.547 --> 00:02:47.591
normally flies 120 to 130 people,

00:02:47.615 --> 00:02:50.200
so maybe you took a similar aircraft
to get here today.

00:02:50.224 --> 00:02:51.476
But we didn't just fly it.

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:54.193
We were flying at 100 meters
above the top of the canopy

00:02:54.217 --> 00:02:56.840
to measure this molecule --
incredibly dangerous stuff.

00:02:56.864 --> 00:02:59.757
We have to fly at a special incline
to make the measurements;

00:02:59.781 --> 00:03:02.372
we hire military and test pilots
to do the maneuvering;

00:03:02.396 --> 00:03:04.000
we need special flight clearance.

00:03:04.024 --> 00:03:06.177
As you come around the banks
in these valleys,

00:03:06.201 --> 00:03:07.737
the forces can get up to two Gs;

00:03:07.761 --> 00:03:09.921
the scientists must be
completely harnessed in

00:03:09.945 --> 00:03:12.044
in order to make measurements
while on board.

00:03:12.068 --> 00:03:13.222
So as you can imagine,

00:03:13.246 --> 00:03:16.653
the inside of the aircraft doesn't look
like one you'd take on vacation.

00:03:16.677 --> 00:03:20.223
It's a flying laboratory we took
to make measurements of this molecule.

00:03:20.247 --> 00:03:23.333
We do all this to understand
the chemistry of one molecule.

00:03:23.357 --> 00:03:26.041
And when one student like me
has some sort of inclination

00:03:26.065 --> 00:03:27.866
or understanding about that molecule,

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:30.107
they write one scientific paper
on the subject.

00:03:30.131 --> 00:03:33.351
And out of that field campaign
we'll probably get a few dozen papers

00:03:33.375 --> 00:03:35.212
on a few dozen processes or molecules.

00:03:35.236 --> 00:03:38.182
As a body of knowledge builds up,
it will form one subsection,

00:03:38.206 --> 00:03:39.357
or one sub-subsection,

00:03:39.381 --> 00:03:42.671
of an assessment like the IPCC,
although we have others.

00:03:42.695 --> 00:03:47.631
And each one of the 11 chapters
of the IPCC has six to ten subsections.

00:03:47.655 --> 00:03:49.695
So you can imagine
the scale of the effort.

00:03:49.719 --> 00:03:53.382
In each one of the assessments we write,
we always tag on a summary,

00:03:53.406 --> 00:03:56.088
and the summary is written
for a non-scientific audience.

00:03:56.112 --> 00:03:58.852
And we hand that summary
to journalists and policy makers

00:03:58.876 --> 00:04:00.746
in order to make headlines like these.

00:04:01.613 --> 00:04:02.801
Thank you very much.

00:04:02.825 --> 00:04:04.651
(Applause)
