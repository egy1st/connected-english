00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:18.150
Hello, everyone. Because this is my first time at TED,

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:20.150
I've decided to bring along an old friend

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:24.150
to help break the ice a bit.

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.150
Yes. That's right. This is Barbie.

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.150
She's 50 years old. And she's looking as young as ever.

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:31.150
(Laughter)

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:33.150
But I'd also like to introduce you to

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:37.150
what may be an unfamiliar face.

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:42.150
This is Fulla. Fulla is the Arab world's answer to Barbie.

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:45.150
Now, according to proponents of the clash of civilizations,

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:49.150
Barbie and Fulla occupy these completely separate spheres.

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:52.150
They have different interests. They have divergent values.

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:55.150
And should they ever come in contact ...

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:58.150
well, I've got to tell you, it's just not going to be pretty.

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:02.150
My experience, however, in the Islamic world is very different.

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:04.150
Where I work, in the Arab region,

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:06.150
people are busy taking up Western innovations

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.150
and changing them into things

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:10.150
which are neither conventionally Western,

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:12.150
nor are they traditionally Islamic.

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.150
I want to show you two examples.

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:16.150
The first is 4Shbab.

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:20.150
It means "for youth" and it's a new Arab TV channel.

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:23.150
(Video): Video clips from across the globe.

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:25.150
The USA.

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:28.150
♫ I am not afraid to stand alone ♫

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:33.150
♫ I am not afraid to stand alone, if Allah is by my side ♫

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:36.150
♫ I am not afraid to stand alone ♫

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.150
♫ Everything will be all right ♫

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:40.150
♫ I am not afraid to stand alone ♫

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:42.150
The Arab world.

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:57.150
(Music)

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:01.150
♫ She was preserved by modesty of the religion ♫

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:05.150
♫ She was adorned by the light of the Quran ♫

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:14.150
Shereen El Feki: 4Shbab has been dubbed Islamic MTV.

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:16.150
Its creator, who is an Egyptian TV producer

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:18.150
called Ahmed Abu Haïba,

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:20.150
wants young people to be inspired

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:23.150
by Islam to lead better lives.

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:25.150
He reckons the best way to get that message across

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:29.150
is to use the enormously popular medium of music videos.

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:32.150
4Shbab was set up as an alternative

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:34.150
to existing Arab music channels.

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:36.150
And they look something like this.

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:39.150
(Music)

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:47.150
That, by the way is Haifa Wehbe. She's a Lebanese pop star

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:50.150
and pan-Arab pin-up girl.

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:53.150
In the world of 4Shbab, it's not about bump and grind.

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:56.150
But it's not about fire and brimstone either.

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:58.150
Its videos are intended to show

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:01.150
a kinder, gentler face of Islam,

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:04.150
for young people to deal with life's challenges.

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:07.150
Now, my second example is for a slightly younger crowd.

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:10.150
And it's called "The 99."

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:13.150
Now, these are the world's first Islamic superheroes.

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:15.150
They were created by a Kuwaiti psychologist

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:17.150
called Naif Al Mutawa.

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:19.150
And his desire is to rescue Islam

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:21.150
from images of intolerance,

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:25.150
all in a child-friendly format.

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:27.150
"The 99." The characters are meant to embody

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:30.150
the 99 attributes of Allah:

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:33.150
justice, wisdom, mercy, among others.

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:37.150
So, for example, there is the character of Noora.

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:39.150
She is meant to have the power

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:41.150
to look inside people

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:44.150
and see the good and bad in everyone.

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:46.150
Another character called Jami

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:50.150
has the ability to create fantastic inventions.

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:52.150
Now, "The 99" is not just a comic book.

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:54.150
It's now a theme park.

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:56.150
There is an animated series in the works.

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:58.150
And by this time next year,

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:00.150
the likes of Superman and Wonder Woman

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:02.150
will have joined forces with "The 99"

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:08.150
to beat injustice wherever they find it.

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:11.150
"The 99" and 4Shbab are just two of many examples

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:15.150
of this sort of Islamic cross-cultural hybridization.

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:18.150
We're not talking here about a clash of civilizations.

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:21.150
Nor is it some sort of indistinguishable mash.

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:24.150
I like to think of it as a mesh of civilizations,

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:28.150
in which the strands of different cultures are intertwined.

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:31.150
Now, while 4Shbab and "The 99" may look new and shiny,

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:34.150
there is actually a very long tradition of this.

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:39.150
Throughout its history, Islam has borrowed and adapted from other civilizations

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:41.150
both ancient and modern.

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:44.150
After all, it's the Quran which encourages us to do this:

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:48.150
"We made you into nations and tribes

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:50.150
so that you could learn from one another."

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:53.150
And to my mind, those are pretty wise words,

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:56.150
no matter what your creed. Thank you.

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:57.150
(Applause)
