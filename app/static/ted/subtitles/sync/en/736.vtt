00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:18.150
In 2008, Cyclone Nargis devastated Myanmar.

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.150
Millions of people were in severe need of help.

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:26.150
The U.N. wanted to rush people and supplies to the area.

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:29.150
But there were no maps, no maps of roads,

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:34.150
no maps showing hospitals, no way for help to reach the cyclone victims.

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:37.150
When we look at a map of Los Angeles or London,

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:40.150
it is hard to believe

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:43.150
that as of 2005, only 15 percent of the world

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:46.150
was mapped to a geo-codable level of detail.

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:49.150
The U.N. ran headfirst into a problem

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:51.150
that the majority of the world's populous faces:

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:53.150
not having detailed maps.

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:55.150
But help was coming.

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:57.150
At Google, 40 volunteers

00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:00.150
used a new software

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:03.150
to map 120,000 kilometers of roads,

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:06.150
3,000 hospitals, logistics and relief points.

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.150
And it took them four days.

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:11.150
The new software they used? Google Mapmaker.

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:14.150
Google Mapmaker is a technology that empowers each of us

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:17.150
to map what we know locally.

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:19.150
People have used this software

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:21.150
to map everything from roads to rivers,

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:24.150
from schools to local businesses,

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.150
and video stores to the corner store.

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.150
Maps matter.

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:31.150
Nobel Prize nominee Hernando De Soto

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:33.150
recognized that the key to economic liftoff

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.150
for most developing countries

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:38.150
is to tap the vast amounts of uncapitalized land.

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:41.150
For example, a trillion dollars

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:44.150
of real estate remains uncapitalized in India alone.

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:46.150
In the last year alone,

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:50.150
thousands of users in 170 countries

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:53.150
have mapped millions of pieces of information,

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:56.150
and created a map of a level of detail never thought viable.

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:58.150
And this was made possible by

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:02.150
the power of passionate users everywhere.

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:05.150
Let's look at some of the maps

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:08.150
being created by users right now.

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:10.150
So, as we speak, people are mapping the world

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:12.150
in these 170 countries.

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:18.150
You can see Bridget in Africa who just mapped a road in Senegal.

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:23.150
And, closer to home, Chalua, an N.G. road in Bangalore.

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:26.150
This is the result of computational geometry,

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:29.150
gesture recognition, and machine learning.

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:31.150
This is a victory of thousands of users,

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:33.150
in hundreds of cities,

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:35.150
one user, one edit at a time.

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:39.150
This is an invitation to the 70 percent

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:41.150
of our unmapped planet.

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:43.150
Welcome to the new world.

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:46.150
(Applause)
