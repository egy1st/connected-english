00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.150
So, imagine you're standing on a street anywhere in America

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:19.150
and a Japanese man comes up to you and says,

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:21.150
"Excuse me, what is the name of this block?"

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:25.150
And you say, "I'm sorry, well, this is Oak Street, that's Elm Street.

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:27.150
This is 26th, that's 27th."

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.150
He says, "OK, but what is the name of that block?"

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:32.150
You say, "Well, blocks don't have names.

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:34.150
Streets have names; blocks are just the

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:36.150
unnamed spaces in between streets."

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:40.150
He leaves, a little confused and disappointed.

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:43.150
So, now imagine you're standing on a street, anywhere in Japan,

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:45.150
you turn to a person next to you and say,

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:47.150
"Excuse me, what is the name of this street?"

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:51.150
They say, "Oh, well that's Block 17 and this is Block 16."

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:54.150
And you say, "OK, but what is the name of this street?"

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:56.150
And they say, "Well, streets don't have names.

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:58.150
Blocks have names.

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:02.150
Just look at Google Maps here. There's Block 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19.

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:04.150
All of these blocks have names,

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:08.150
and the streets are just the unnamed spaces in between the blocks.

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:11.150
And you say then, "OK, then how do you know your home address?"

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:14.150
He said, "Well, easy, this is District Eight.

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:17.150
There's Block 17, house number one."

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:19.150
You say, "OK, but walking around the neighborhood,

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:21.150
I noticed that the house numbers don't go in order."

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:24.150
He says, "Of course they do. They go in the order in which they were built.

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.150
The first house ever built on a block is house number one.

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:30.150
The second house ever built is house number two.

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.150
Third is house number three. It's easy. It's obvious."

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:35.150
So, I love that sometimes we need to

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:37.150
go to the opposite side of the world

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:39.150
to realize assumptions we didn't even know we had,

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:42.150
and realize that the opposite of them may also be true.

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.150
So, for example, there are doctors in China

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:47.150
who believe that it's their job to keep you healthy.

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:49.150
So, any month you are healthy you pay them,

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:51.150
and when you're sick you don't have to pay them because they failed

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:53.150
at their job. They get rich when you're healthy, not sick.

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:56.150
(Applause)

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:58.150
In most music, we think of the "one"

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:02.150
as the downbeat, the beginning of the musical phrase: one, two, three, four.

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:04.150
But in West African music, the "one"

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:06.150
is thought of as the end of the phrase,

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:08.150
like the period at the end of a sentence.

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:10.150
So, you can hear it not just in the phrasing, but the way they count off their music:

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:13.150
two, three, four, one.

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:16.150
And this map is also accurate.

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:18.150
(Laughter)

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:21.150
There's a saying that whatever true thing you can say about India,

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:23.150
the opposite is also true.

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:25.150
So, let's never forget, whether at TED, or anywhere else,

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:28.150
that whatever brilliant ideas you have or hear,

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:30.150
that the opposite may also be true.

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:32.150
Domo arigato gozaimashita.
