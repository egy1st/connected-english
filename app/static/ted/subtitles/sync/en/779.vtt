00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.150
Everybody talks about happiness these days.

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:18.150
I had somebody count the number of books

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.150
with "happiness" in the title published in the last five years

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:26.150
and they gave up after about 40, and there were many more.

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:29.150
There is a huge wave of interest in happiness,

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:31.150
among researchers.

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:33.150
There is a lot of happiness coaching.

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:35.150
Everybody would like to make people happier.

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:39.150
But in spite of all this flood of work,

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:41.150
there are several cognitive traps

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:44.150
that sort of make it almost impossible to think straight

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:46.150
about happiness.

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:49.150
And my talk today will be mostly about these cognitive traps.

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:52.150
This applies to laypeople thinking about their own happiness,

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:55.150
and it applies to scholars thinking about happiness,

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:59.150
because it turns out we're just as messed up as anybody else is.

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:01.150
The first of these traps

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:04.150
is a reluctance to admit complexity.

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:07.150
It turns out that the word "happiness"

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:10.150
is just not a useful word anymore,

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:13.150
because we apply it to too many different things.

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:16.150
I think there is one particular meaning to which we might restrict it,

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:18.150
but by and large,

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.150
this is something that we'll have to give up

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:24.150
and we'll have to adopt the more complicated view

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.150
of what well-being is.

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:30.150
The second trap is a confusion between experience and memory;

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.150
basically, it's between being happy in your life,

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.150
and being happy about your life

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:37.150
or happy with your life.

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:39.150
And those are two very different concepts,

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:42.150
and they're both lumped in the notion of happiness.

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:45.150
And the third is the focusing illusion,

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:48.150
and it's the unfortunate fact that we can't think about any circumstance

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:50.150
that affects well-being

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:52.150
without distorting its importance.

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:55.150
I mean, this is a real cognitive trap.

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:58.150
There's just no way of getting it right.

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:00.150
Now, I'd like to start with an example

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:05.150
of somebody who had a question-and-answer session

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:09.150
after one of my lectures reported a story,

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:10.150
and that was a story --

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:13.150
He said he'd been listening to a symphony,

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:16.150
and it was absolutely glorious music

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:19.150
and at the very end of the recording,

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:21.150
there was a dreadful screeching sound.

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:23.150
And then he added, really quite emotionally,

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:27.150
it ruined the whole experience.

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:29.150
But it hadn't.

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:32.150
What it had ruined were the memories of the experience.

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:34.150
He had had the experience.

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:36.150
He had had 20 minutes of glorious music.

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:38.150
They counted for nothing

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:41.150
because he was left with a memory;

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:43.150
the memory was ruined,

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:46.150
and the memory was all that he had gotten to keep.

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:49.150
What this is telling us, really,

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:51.150
is that we might be thinking of ourselves and of other people

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:53.150
in terms of two selves.

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:56.150
There is an experiencing self,

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:58.150
who lives in the present

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:00.150
and knows the present,

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:02.150
is capable of re-living the past,

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:05.150
but basically it has only the present.

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:08.150
It's the experiencing self that the doctor approaches --

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:09.150
you know, when the doctor asks,

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:13.150
"Does it hurt now when I touch you here?"

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:16.150
And then there is a remembering self,

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:20.150
and the remembering self is the one that keeps score,

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:22.150
and maintains the story of our life,

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:25.150
and it's the one that the doctor approaches

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:27.150
in asking the question,

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:30.150
"How have you been feeling lately?"

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:33.150
or "How was your trip to Albania?" or something like that.

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:36.150
Those are two very different entities,

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:39.150
the experiencing self and the remembering self,

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:43.150
and getting confused between them is part of the mess

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:46.150
about the notion of happiness.

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:49.150
Now, the remembering self

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:52.150
is a storyteller.

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:56.150
And that really starts with a basic response of our memories --

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:58.150
it starts immediately.

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:01.150
We don't only tell stories when we set out to tell stories.

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:04.150
Our memory tells us stories,

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:06.150
that is, what we get to keep from our experiences

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:08.150
is a story.

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:13.150
And let me begin with one example.

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:15.150
This is an old study.

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:18.150
Those are actual patients undergoing a painful procedure.

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:21.150
I won't go into detail. It's no longer painful these days,

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:25.150
but it was painful when this study was run in the 1990s.

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:28.150
They were asked to report on their pain every 60 seconds.

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:31.150
Here are two patients,

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:33.150
those are their recordings.

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:36.150
And you are asked, "Who of them suffered more?"

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:38.150
And it's a very easy question.

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:40.150
Clearly, Patient B suffered more --

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:42.150
his colonoscopy was longer,

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:45.150
and every minute of pain that Patient A had,

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:48.150
Patient B had, and more.

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:51.150
But now there is another question:

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:54.150
"How much did these patients think they suffered?"

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:56.150
And here is a surprise.

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:58.150
The surprise is that Patient A

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:01.150
had a much worse memory of the colonoscopy

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:03.150
than Patient B.

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:06.150
The stories of the colonoscopies were different,

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:12.150
and because a very critical part of the story is how it ends.

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:15.150
And neither of these stories is very inspiring or great --

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:19.150
but one of them is this distinct ... (Laughter)

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:22.150
but one of them is distinctly worse than the other.

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:24.150
And the one that is worse

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:27.150
is the one where pain was at its peak at the very end;

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:29.150
it's a bad story.

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:31.150
How do we know that?

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:34.150
Because we asked these people after their colonoscopy,

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:35.150
and much later, too,

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:37.150
"How bad was the whole thing, in total?"

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:41.150
And it was much worse for A than for B, in memory.

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:43.150
Now this is a direct conflict

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:46.150
between the experiencing self and the remembering self.

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:49.150
From the point of view of the experiencing self,

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:51.150
clearly, B had a worse time.

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:54.150
Now, what you could do with Patient A,

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:57.150
and we actually ran clinical experiments,

00:05:57.150 --> 00:05:59.150
and it has been done, and it does work --

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:04.150
you could actually extend the colonoscopy of Patient A

00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:07.150
by just keeping the tube in without jiggling it too much.

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:10.150
That will cause the patient

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:13.150
to suffer, but just a little

00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:15.150
and much less than before.

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:17.150
And if you do that for a couple of minutes,

00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:19.150
you have made the experiencing self

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:21.150
of Patient A worse off,

00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:24.150
and you have the remembering self of Patient A

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:26.150
a lot better off,

00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:28.150
because now you have endowed Patient A

00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:30.150
with a better story

00:06:30.150 --> 00:06:33.150
about his experience.

00:06:33.150 --> 00:06:36.150
What defines a story?

00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:38.150
And that is true of the stories

00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:40.150
that memory delivers for us,

00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:43.150
and it's also true of the stories that we make up.

00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:47.150
What defines a story are changes,

00:06:47.150 --> 00:06:50.150
significant moments and endings.

00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:52.150
Endings are very, very important

00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:56.150
and, in this case, the ending dominated.

00:06:56.150 --> 00:06:58.150
Now, the experiencing self

00:06:58.150 --> 00:07:01.150
lives its life continuously.

00:07:01.150 --> 00:07:04.150
It has moments of experience, one after the other.

00:07:04.150 --> 00:07:07.150
And you can ask: What happens to these moments?

00:07:07.150 --> 00:07:09.150
And the answer is really straightforward:

00:07:09.150 --> 00:07:11.150
They are lost forever.

00:07:11.150 --> 00:07:13.150
I mean, most of the moments of our life --

00:07:13.150 --> 00:07:16.150
and I calculated, you know, the psychological present

00:07:16.150 --> 00:07:18.150
is said to be about three seconds long;

00:07:18.150 --> 00:07:20.150
that means that, you know,

00:07:20.150 --> 00:07:22.150
in a life there are about 600 million of them;

00:07:22.150 --> 00:07:25.150
in a month, there are about 600,000 --

00:07:25.150 --> 00:07:29.150
most of them don't leave a trace.

00:07:29.150 --> 00:07:31.150
Most of them are completely ignored

00:07:31.150 --> 00:07:33.150
by the remembering self.

00:07:33.150 --> 00:07:35.150
And yet, somehow you get the sense

00:07:35.150 --> 00:07:37.150
that they should count,

00:07:37.150 --> 00:07:40.150
that what happens during these moments of experience

00:07:40.150 --> 00:07:42.150
is our life.

00:07:42.150 --> 00:07:44.150
It's the finite resource that we're spending

00:07:44.150 --> 00:07:46.150
while we're on this earth.

00:07:46.150 --> 00:07:48.150
And how to spend it

00:07:48.150 --> 00:07:50.150
would seem to be relevant,

00:07:50.150 --> 00:07:52.150
but that is not the story

00:07:52.150 --> 00:07:54.150
that the remembering self keeps for us.

00:07:54.150 --> 00:07:56.150
So we have the remembering self

00:07:56.150 --> 00:07:58.150
and the experiencing self,

00:07:58.150 --> 00:08:00.150
and they're really quite distinct.

00:08:00.150 --> 00:08:02.150
The biggest difference between them

00:08:02.150 --> 00:08:05.150
is in the handling of time.

00:08:05.150 --> 00:08:08.150
From the point of view of the experiencing self,

00:08:08.150 --> 00:08:10.150
if you have a vacation,

00:08:10.150 --> 00:08:13.150
and the second week is just as good as the first,

00:08:13.150 --> 00:08:16.150
then the two-week vacation

00:08:16.150 --> 00:08:19.150
is twice as good as the one-week vacation.

00:08:19.150 --> 00:08:22.150
That's not the way it works at all for the remembering self.

00:08:22.150 --> 00:08:24.150
For the remembering self, a two-week vacation

00:08:24.150 --> 00:08:27.150
is barely better than the one-week vacation

00:08:27.150 --> 00:08:29.150
because there are no new memories added.

00:08:29.150 --> 00:08:32.150
You have not changed the story.

00:08:32.150 --> 00:08:34.150
And in this way,

00:08:34.150 --> 00:08:37.150
time is actually the critical variable

00:08:37.150 --> 00:08:40.150
that distinguishes a remembering self

00:08:40.150 --> 00:08:42.150
from an experiencing self;

00:08:42.150 --> 00:08:45.150
time has very little impact on the story.

00:08:46.150 --> 00:08:49.150
Now, the remembering self does more

00:08:49.150 --> 00:08:51.150
than remember and tell stories.

00:08:51.150 --> 00:08:55.150
It is actually the one that makes decisions

00:08:55.150 --> 00:08:57.150
because, if you have a patient who has had, say,

00:08:57.150 --> 00:09:00.150
two colonoscopies with two different surgeons

00:09:00.150 --> 00:09:03.150
and is deciding which of them to choose,

00:09:03.150 --> 00:09:06.150
then the one that chooses

00:09:06.150 --> 00:09:10.150
is the one that has the memory that is less bad,

00:09:10.150 --> 00:09:12.150
and that's the surgeon that will be chosen.

00:09:12.150 --> 00:09:14.150
The experiencing self

00:09:14.150 --> 00:09:17.150
has no voice in this choice.

00:09:17.150 --> 00:09:20.150
We actually don't choose between experiences,

00:09:20.150 --> 00:09:23.150
we choose between memories of experiences.

00:09:23.150 --> 00:09:26.150
And even when we think about the future,

00:09:26.150 --> 00:09:29.150
we don't think of our future normally as experiences.

00:09:29.150 --> 00:09:31.150
We think of our future

00:09:31.150 --> 00:09:34.150
as anticipated memories.

00:09:34.150 --> 00:09:36.150
And basically you can look at this,

00:09:36.150 --> 00:09:39.150
you know, as a tyranny of the remembering self,

00:09:39.150 --> 00:09:41.150
and you can think of the remembering self

00:09:41.150 --> 00:09:43.150
sort of dragging the experiencing self

00:09:43.150 --> 00:09:45.150
through experiences that

00:09:45.150 --> 00:09:47.150
the experiencing self doesn't need.

00:09:47.150 --> 00:09:49.150
I have that sense that

00:09:49.150 --> 00:09:51.150
when we go on vacations

00:09:51.150 --> 00:09:53.150
this is very frequently the case;

00:09:53.150 --> 00:09:55.150
that is, we go on vacations,

00:09:55.150 --> 00:09:57.150
to a very large extent,

00:09:57.150 --> 00:10:00.150
in the service of our remembering self.

00:10:00.150 --> 00:10:03.150
And this is a bit hard to justify I think.

00:10:03.150 --> 00:10:06.150
I mean, how much do we consume our memories?

00:10:06.150 --> 00:10:08.150
That is one of the explanations

00:10:08.150 --> 00:10:10.150
that is given for the dominance

00:10:10.150 --> 00:10:12.150
of the remembering self.

00:10:12.150 --> 00:10:14.150
And when I think about that, I think about a vacation

00:10:14.150 --> 00:10:17.150
we had in Antarctica a few years ago,

00:10:17.150 --> 00:10:20.150
which was clearly the best vacation I've ever had,

00:10:20.150 --> 00:10:22.150
and I think of it relatively often,

00:10:22.150 --> 00:10:24.150
relative to how much I think of other vacations.

00:10:24.150 --> 00:10:28.150
And I probably have consumed

00:10:28.150 --> 00:10:30.150
my memories of that three-week trip, I would say,

00:10:30.150 --> 00:10:33.150
for about 25 minutes in the last four years.

00:10:33.150 --> 00:10:36.150
Now, if I had ever opened the folder

00:10:36.150 --> 00:10:39.150
with the 600 pictures in it,

00:10:39.150 --> 00:10:41.150
I would have spent another hour.

00:10:41.150 --> 00:10:43.150
Now, that is three weeks,

00:10:43.150 --> 00:10:45.150
and that is at most an hour and a half.

00:10:45.150 --> 00:10:47.150
There seems to be a discrepancy.

00:10:47.150 --> 00:10:49.150
Now, I may be a bit extreme, you know,

00:10:49.150 --> 00:10:52.150
in how little appetite I have for consuming memories,

00:10:52.150 --> 00:10:55.150
but even if you do more of this,

00:10:55.150 --> 00:10:58.150
there is a genuine question:

00:10:58.150 --> 00:11:02.150
Why do we put so much weight on memory

00:11:02.150 --> 00:11:05.150
relative to the weight that we put on experiences?

00:11:05.150 --> 00:11:07.150
So I want you to think

00:11:07.150 --> 00:11:10.150
about a thought experiment.

00:11:10.150 --> 00:11:12.150
Imagine that for your next vacation,

00:11:12.150 --> 00:11:15.150
you know that at the end of the vacation

00:11:15.150 --> 00:11:18.150
all your pictures will be destroyed,

00:11:18.150 --> 00:11:20.150
and you'll get an amnesic drug

00:11:20.150 --> 00:11:22.150
so that you won't remember anything.

00:11:22.150 --> 00:11:26.150
Now, would you choose the same vacation? (Laughter)

00:11:26.150 --> 00:11:31.150
And if you would choose a different vacation,

00:11:31.150 --> 00:11:33.150
there is a conflict between your two selves,

00:11:33.150 --> 00:11:36.150
and you need to think about how to adjudicate that conflict,

00:11:36.150 --> 00:11:39.150
and it's actually not at all obvious, because

00:11:39.150 --> 00:11:42.150
if you think in terms of time,

00:11:42.150 --> 00:11:45.150
then you get one answer,

00:11:45.150 --> 00:11:48.150
and if you think in terms of memories,

00:11:48.150 --> 00:11:50.150
you might get another answer.

00:11:50.150 --> 00:11:53.150
Why do we pick the vacations we do

00:11:53.150 --> 00:11:56.150
is a problem that confronts us

00:11:56.150 --> 00:11:58.150
with a choice between the two selves.

00:11:58.150 --> 00:12:01.150
Now, the two selves

00:12:01.150 --> 00:12:03.150
bring up two notions of happiness.

00:12:03.150 --> 00:12:05.150
There are really two concepts of happiness

00:12:05.150 --> 00:12:08.150
that we can apply, one per self.

00:12:08.150 --> 00:12:13.150
So you can ask: How happy is the experiencing self?

00:12:13.150 --> 00:12:15.150
And then you would ask: How happy are the moments

00:12:15.150 --> 00:12:18.150
in the experiencing self's life?

00:12:18.150 --> 00:12:20.150
And they're all -- happiness for moments

00:12:20.150 --> 00:12:22.150
is a fairly complicated process.

00:12:22.150 --> 00:12:25.150
What are the emotions that can be measured?

00:12:25.150 --> 00:12:27.150
And, by the way, now we are capable

00:12:27.150 --> 00:12:29.150
of getting a pretty good idea

00:12:29.150 --> 00:12:33.150
of the happiness of the experiencing self over time.

00:12:35.150 --> 00:12:38.150
If you ask for the happiness of the remembering self,

00:12:38.150 --> 00:12:40.150
it's a completely different thing.

00:12:40.150 --> 00:12:43.150
This is not about how happily a person lives.

00:12:43.150 --> 00:12:46.150
It is about how satisfied or pleased the person is

00:12:46.150 --> 00:12:50.150
when that person thinks about her life.

00:12:50.150 --> 00:12:52.150
Very different notion.

00:12:52.150 --> 00:12:55.150
Anyone who doesn't distinguish those notions

00:12:55.150 --> 00:12:57.150
is going to mess up the study of happiness,

00:12:57.150 --> 00:13:00.150
and I belong to a crowd of students of well-being,

00:13:00.150 --> 00:13:04.150
who've been messing up the study of happiness for a long time

00:13:04.150 --> 00:13:06.150
in precisely this way.

00:13:06.150 --> 00:13:08.150
The distinction between the

00:13:08.150 --> 00:13:10.150
happiness of the experiencing self

00:13:10.150 --> 00:13:13.150
and the satisfaction of the remembering self

00:13:13.150 --> 00:13:15.150
has been recognized in recent years,

00:13:15.150 --> 00:13:18.150
and there are now efforts to measure the two separately.

00:13:18.150 --> 00:13:21.150
The Gallup Organization has a world poll

00:13:21.150 --> 00:13:23.150
where more than half a million people

00:13:23.150 --> 00:13:25.150
have been asked questions

00:13:25.150 --> 00:13:27.150
about what they think of their life

00:13:27.150 --> 00:13:29.150
and about their experiences,

00:13:29.150 --> 00:13:32.150
and there have been other efforts along those lines.

00:13:32.150 --> 00:13:35.150
So in recent years, we have begun to learn

00:13:35.150 --> 00:13:38.150
about the happiness of the two selves.

00:13:38.150 --> 00:13:41.150
And the main lesson I think that we have learned

00:13:41.150 --> 00:13:43.150
is they are really different.

00:13:43.150 --> 00:13:48.150
You can know how satisfied somebody is with their life,

00:13:48.150 --> 00:13:50.150
and that really doesn't teach you much

00:13:50.150 --> 00:13:53.150
about how happily they're living their life,

00:13:53.150 --> 00:13:55.150
and vice versa.

00:13:55.150 --> 00:13:57.150
Just to give you a sense of the correlation,

00:13:57.150 --> 00:13:59.150
the correlation is about .5.

00:13:59.150 --> 00:14:02.150
What that means is if you met somebody,

00:14:02.150 --> 00:14:06.150
and you were told, "Oh his father is six feet tall,"

00:14:06.150 --> 00:14:08.150
how much would you know about his height?

00:14:08.150 --> 00:14:10.150
Well, you would know something about his height,

00:14:10.150 --> 00:14:12.150
but there's a lot of uncertainty.

00:14:12.150 --> 00:14:14.150
You have that much uncertainty.

00:14:14.150 --> 00:14:18.150
If I tell you that somebody ranked their life eight on a scale of ten,

00:14:18.150 --> 00:14:20.150
you have a lot of uncertainty

00:14:20.150 --> 00:14:22.150
about how happy they are

00:14:22.150 --> 00:14:24.150
with their experiencing self.

00:14:24.150 --> 00:14:26.150
So the correlation is low.

00:14:26.150 --> 00:14:29.150
We know something about what controls

00:14:29.150 --> 00:14:31.150
satisfaction of the happiness self.

00:14:31.150 --> 00:14:33.150
We know that money is very important,

00:14:33.150 --> 00:14:35.150
goals are very important.

00:14:35.150 --> 00:14:39.150
We know that happiness is mainly

00:14:39.150 --> 00:14:42.150
being satisfied with people that we like,

00:14:42.150 --> 00:14:45.150
spending time with people that we like.

00:14:45.150 --> 00:14:47.150
There are other pleasures, but this is dominant.

00:14:47.150 --> 00:14:50.150
So if you want to maximize the happiness of the two selves,

00:14:50.150 --> 00:14:52.150
you are going to end up

00:14:52.150 --> 00:14:54.150
doing very different things.

00:14:54.150 --> 00:14:56.150
The bottom line of what I've said here

00:14:56.150 --> 00:15:00.150
is that we really should not think of happiness

00:15:00.150 --> 00:15:02.150
as a substitute for well-being.

00:15:02.150 --> 00:15:05.150
It is a completely different notion.

00:15:05.150 --> 00:15:08.150
Now, very quickly,

00:15:08.150 --> 00:15:12.150
another reason we cannot think straight about happiness

00:15:12.150 --> 00:15:19.150
is that we do not attend to the same things

00:15:19.150 --> 00:15:22.150
when we think about life, and we actually live.

00:15:22.150 --> 00:15:27.150
So, if you ask the simple question of how happy people are in California,

00:15:27.150 --> 00:15:30.150
you are not going to get to the correct answer.

00:15:30.150 --> 00:15:32.150
When you ask that question,

00:15:32.150 --> 00:15:34.150
you think people must be happier in California

00:15:34.150 --> 00:15:36.150
if, say, you live in Ohio.

00:15:36.150 --> 00:15:38.150
(Laughter)

00:15:38.150 --> 00:15:41.150
And what happens is

00:15:41.150 --> 00:15:45.150
when you think about living in California,

00:15:45.150 --> 00:15:47.150
you are thinking of the contrast

00:15:47.150 --> 00:15:50.150
between California and other places,

00:15:50.150 --> 00:15:52.150
and that contrast, say, is in climate.

00:15:52.150 --> 00:15:54.150
Well, it turns out that climate

00:15:54.150 --> 00:15:57.150
is not very important to the experiencing self

00:15:57.150 --> 00:16:00.150
and it's not even very important to the reflective self

00:16:00.150 --> 00:16:03.150
that decides how happy people are.

00:16:03.150 --> 00:16:07.150
But now, because the reflective self is in charge,

00:16:07.150 --> 00:16:09.150
you may end up -- some people may end up

00:16:09.150 --> 00:16:11.150
moving to California.

00:16:11.150 --> 00:16:14.150
And it's sort of interesting to trace what is going to happen

00:16:14.150 --> 00:16:17.150
to people who move to California in the hope of getting happier.

00:16:17.150 --> 00:16:19.150
Well, their experiencing self

00:16:19.150 --> 00:16:21.150
is not going to get happier.

00:16:21.150 --> 00:16:23.150
We know that.

00:16:24.150 --> 00:16:27.150
But one thing will happen: They will think they are happier,

00:16:27.150 --> 00:16:31.150
because, when they think about it,

00:16:31.150 --> 00:16:35.150
they'll be reminded of how horrible the weather was in Ohio,

00:16:35.150 --> 00:16:38.150
and they will feel they made the right decision.

00:16:38.150 --> 00:16:40.150
It is very difficult

00:16:40.150 --> 00:16:42.150
to think straight about well-being,

00:16:42.150 --> 00:16:45.150
and I hope I have given you a sense

00:16:45.150 --> 00:16:47.150
of how difficult it is.

00:16:47.150 --> 00:16:49.150
Thank you.

00:16:49.150 --> 00:16:52.150
(Applause)

00:16:52.150 --> 00:16:55.150
Chris Anderson: Thank you. I've got a question for you.

00:16:56.150 --> 00:16:58.150
Thank you so much.

00:16:58.150 --> 00:17:02.150
Now, when we were on the phone a few weeks ago,

00:17:02.150 --> 00:17:05.150
you mentioned to me that there was quite an interesting result

00:17:05.150 --> 00:17:07.150
came out of that Gallup survey.

00:17:07.150 --> 00:17:09.150
Is that something you can share

00:17:09.150 --> 00:17:11.150
since you do have a few moments left now?

00:17:11.150 --> 00:17:13.150
Daniel Kahneman: Sure.

00:17:13.150 --> 00:17:16.150
I think the most interesting result that we found in the Gallup survey

00:17:16.150 --> 00:17:19.150
is a number, which we absolutely did not expect to find.

00:17:19.150 --> 00:17:21.150
We found that with respect to the happiness

00:17:21.150 --> 00:17:24.150
of the experiencing self.

00:17:24.150 --> 00:17:29.150
When we looked at how feelings,

00:17:29.150 --> 00:17:31.150
vary with income.

00:17:31.150 --> 00:17:34.150
And it turns out that, below an income

00:17:34.150 --> 00:17:37.150
of 60,000 dollars a year, for Americans --

00:17:37.150 --> 00:17:40.150
and that's a very large sample of Americans, like 600,000,

00:17:40.150 --> 00:17:42.150
so it's a large representative sample --

00:17:42.150 --> 00:17:44.150
below an income of 600,000 dollars a year...

00:17:44.150 --> 00:17:46.150
CA: 60,000.

00:17:46.150 --> 00:17:48.150
DK: 60,000.

00:17:48.150 --> 00:17:50.150
(Laughter)

00:17:50.150 --> 00:17:54.150
60,000 dollars a year, people are unhappy,

00:17:54.150 --> 00:17:57.150
and they get progressively unhappier the poorer they get.

00:17:57.150 --> 00:18:00.150
Above that, we get an absolutely flat line.

00:18:00.150 --> 00:18:03.150
I mean I've rarely seen lines so flat.

00:18:03.150 --> 00:18:05.150
Clearly, what is happening is

00:18:05.150 --> 00:18:08.150
money does not buy you experiential happiness,

00:18:08.150 --> 00:18:11.150
but lack of money certainly buys you misery,

00:18:11.150 --> 00:18:13.150
and we can measure that misery

00:18:13.150 --> 00:18:15.150
very, very clearly.

00:18:15.150 --> 00:18:18.150
In terms of the other self, the remembering self,

00:18:18.150 --> 00:18:20.150
you get a different story.

00:18:20.150 --> 00:18:23.150
The more money you earn, the more satisfied you are.

00:18:23.150 --> 00:18:25.150
That does not hold for emotions.

00:18:25.150 --> 00:18:28.150
CA: But Danny, the whole American endeavor is about

00:18:28.150 --> 00:18:31.150
life, liberty, the pursuit of happiness.

00:18:31.150 --> 00:18:35.150
If people took seriously that finding,

00:18:35.150 --> 00:18:38.150
I mean, it seems to turn upside down

00:18:38.150 --> 00:18:40.150
everything we believe about, like for example,

00:18:40.150 --> 00:18:42.150
taxation policy and so forth.

00:18:42.150 --> 00:18:45.150
Is there any chance that politicians, that the country generally,

00:18:45.150 --> 00:18:48.150
would take a finding like that seriously

00:18:48.150 --> 00:18:50.150
and run public policy based on it?

00:18:50.150 --> 00:18:52.150
DK: You know I think that there is recognition

00:18:52.150 --> 00:18:55.150
of the role of happiness research in public policy.

00:18:55.150 --> 00:18:57.150
The recognition is going to be slow in the United States,

00:18:57.150 --> 00:18:59.150
no question about that,

00:18:59.150 --> 00:19:01.150
but in the U.K., it is happening,

00:19:01.150 --> 00:19:03.150
and in other countries it is happening.

00:19:03.150 --> 00:19:06.150
People are recognizing that they ought

00:19:06.150 --> 00:19:08.150
to be thinking of happiness

00:19:08.150 --> 00:19:10.150
when they think of public policy.

00:19:10.150 --> 00:19:12.150
It's going to take a while,

00:19:12.150 --> 00:19:15.150
and people are going to debate

00:19:15.150 --> 00:19:17.150
whether they want to study experience happiness,

00:19:17.150 --> 00:19:19.150
or whether they want to study life evaluation,

00:19:19.150 --> 00:19:22.150
so we need to have that debate fairly soon.

00:19:22.150 --> 00:19:24.150
How to enhance happiness

00:19:24.150 --> 00:19:27.150
goes very different ways depending on how you think,

00:19:27.150 --> 00:19:29.150
and whether you think of the remembering self

00:19:29.150 --> 00:19:31.150
or you think of the experiencing self.

00:19:31.150 --> 00:19:34.150
This is going to influence policy, I think, in years to come.

00:19:34.150 --> 00:19:37.150
In the United States, efforts are being made

00:19:37.150 --> 00:19:40.150
to measure the experience happiness of the population.

00:19:40.150 --> 00:19:43.150
This is going to be, I think, within the next decade or two,

00:19:43.150 --> 00:19:45.150
part of national statistics.

00:19:45.150 --> 00:19:49.150
CA: Well, it seems to me that this issue will -- or at least should be --

00:19:49.150 --> 00:19:51.150
the most interesting policy discussion to track

00:19:51.150 --> 00:19:53.150
over the next few years.

00:19:53.150 --> 00:19:55.150
Thank you so much for inventing behavioral economics.

00:19:55.150 --> 00:19:57.150
Thank you, Danny Kahneman.
