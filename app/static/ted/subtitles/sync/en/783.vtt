00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:15.150
If I can leave you with one big idea today,

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:17.150
it's that the whole of the data

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:19.150
in which we consume

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:21.150
is greater that the sum of the parts,

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.150
and instead of thinking about information overload,

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.150
what I'd like you to think about is how

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:29.150
we can use information so that patterns pop

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:32.150
and we can see trends that would otherwise be invisible.

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:35.150
So what we're looking at right here is a typical mortality chart

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:37.150
organized by age.

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:39.150
This tool that I'm using here is a little experiment.

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:42.150
It's called Pivot, and with Pivot what I can do

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:46.150
is I can choose to filter in one particular cause of deaths -- say, accidents.

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:49.150
And, right away, I see there's a different pattern that emerges.

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:51.150
This is because, in the mid-area here,

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:53.150
people are at their most active,

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:55.150
and over here they're at their most frail.

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:57.150
We can step back out again

00:00:57.150 --> 00:00:59.150
and then reorganize the data by cause of death,

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:02.150
seeing that circulatory diseases and cancer

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:05.150
are the usual suspects, but not for everyone.

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:08.150
If we go ahead and we filter by age --

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:10.150
say 40 years or less --

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:12.150
we see that accidents are actually

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.150
the greatest cause that people have to be worried about.

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:18.150
And if you drill into that, it's especially the case for men.

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.150
So you get the idea

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:23.150
that viewing information, viewing data in this way,

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:25.150
is a lot like swimming

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:28.150
in a living information info-graphic.

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:30.150
And if we can do this for raw data,

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.150
why not do it for content as well?

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.150
So what we have right here

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:38.150
is the cover of every single Sports Illustrated

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:40.150
ever produced.

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:42.150
It's all here; it's all on the web.

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:45.150
You can go back to your rooms and try this after my talk.

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:48.150
With Pivot, you can drill into a decade.

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:50.150
You can drill into a particular year.

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:53.150
You can jump right into a specific issue.

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:55.150
So I'm looking at this; I see the athletes

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:57.150
that have appeared in this issue, the sports.

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:00.150
I'm a Lance Armstrong fan, so I'll go ahead and I'll click on that,

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:02.150
which reveals, for me, all the issues

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:04.150
in which Lance Armstrong's been a part of.

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:07.150
(Applause)

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:10.150
Now, if I want to just kind of take a peek at these,

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:12.150
I might think,

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:14.150
"Well, what about taking a look at all of cycling?"

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:16.150
So I can step back, and expand on that.

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:18.150
And I see Greg LeMond now.

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:20.150
And so you get the idea that when you

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:22.150
navigate over information this way --

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:24.150
going narrower, broader,

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:26.150
backing in, backing out --

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:28.150
you're not searching, you're not browsing.

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:30.150
You're doing something that's actually a little bit different.

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:33.150
It's in between, and we think it changes

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:35.150
the way information can be used.

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:37.150
So I want to extrapolate on this idea a bit

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:39.150
with something that's a little bit crazy.

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:42.150
What we're done here is we've taken every single Wikipedia page

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:45.150
and we reduced it down to a little summary.

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:48.150
So the summary consists of just a little synopsis

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:51.150
and an icon to indicate the topical area that it comes from.

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:54.150
I'm only showing the top 500

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:56.150
most popular Wikipedia pages right here.

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:58.150
But even in this limited view,

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:00.150
we can do a lot of things.

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:02.150
Right away, we get a sense of what are the topical domains

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:04.150
that are most popular on Wikipedia.

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:06.150
I'm going to go ahead and select government.

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:09.150
Now, having selected government,

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:11.150
I can now see that the Wikipedia categories

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:13.150
that most frequently correspond to that

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:16.150
are Time magazine People of the Year.

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:19.150
So this is really important because this is an insight

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:22.150
that was not contained within any one Wikipedia page.

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:24.150
It's only possible to see that insight

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:27.150
when you step back and look at all of them.

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:29.150
Looking at one of these particular summaries,

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:32.150
I can then drill into the concept of

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:34.150
Time magazine Person of the Year,

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:36.150
bringing up all of them.

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:38.150
So looking at these people,

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:41.150
I can see that the majority come from government;

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:45.150
some have come from natural sciences;

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:49.150
some, fewer still, have come from business --

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:52.150
there's my boss --

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:57.150
and one has come from music.

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:59.150
And interestingly enough,

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:02.150
Bono is also a TED Prize winner.

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:05.150
So we can go, jump, and take a look at all the TED Prize winners.

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:08.150
So you see, we're navigating the web for the first time

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:11.150
as if it's actually a web, not from page-to-page,

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:13.150
but at a higher level of abstraction.

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:15.150
And so I want to show you one other thing

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:18.150
that may catch you a little bit by surprise.

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:21.150
I'm just showing the New York Times website here.

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:23.150
So Pivot, this application --

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:25.150
I don't want to call it a browser; it's really not a browser,

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:28.150
but you can view web pages with it --

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:30.150
and we bring that zoomable technology

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:33.150
to every single web page like this.

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:36.150
So I can step back,

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:38.150
pop right back into a specific section.

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:40.150
Now the reason why this is important is because,

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:43.150
by virtue of just viewing web pages in this way,

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:45.150
I can look at my entire browsing history

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:47.150
in the exact same way.

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:49.150
So I can drill into what I've done

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:51.150
over specific time frames.

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:53.150
Here, in fact, is the state

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:55.150
of all the demo that I just gave.

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:58.150
And I can sort of replay some stuff that I was looking at earlier today.

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:01.150
And, if I want to step back and look at everything,

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:03.150
I can slice and dice my history,

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:05.150
perhaps by my search history --

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:07.150
here, I was doing some nepotistic searching,

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:10.150
looking for Bing, over here for Live Labs Pivot.

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:12.150
And from these, I can drill into the web page

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:14.150
and just launch them again.

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:17.150
It's one metaphor repurposed multiple times,

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:19.150
and in each case it makes the whole greater

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:21.150
than the sum of the parts with the data.

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:24.150
So right now, in this world,

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:27.150
we think about data as being this curse.

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:30.150
We talk about the curse of information overload.

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:33.150
We talk about drowning in data.

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:35.150
What if we can actually turn that upside down

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:37.150
and turn the web upside down,

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:40.150
so that instead of navigating from one thing to the next,

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:43.150
we get used to the habit of being able to go from many things to many things,

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:45.150
and then being able to see the patterns

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:47.150
that were otherwise hidden?

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:52.150
If we can do that, then instead of being trapped in data,

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:55.150
we might actually extract information.

00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:57.150
And, instead of dealing just with information,

00:05:57.150 --> 00:05:59.150
we can tease out knowledge.

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:02.150
And if we get the knowledge, then maybe even there's wisdom to be found.

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:04.150
So with that, I thank you.

00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:12.150
(Applause)
