00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:17.150
So, I've known a lot of fish in my life.

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:20.150
I've loved only two.

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:22.150
That first one,

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:25.150
it was more like a passionate affair.

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:27.150
It was a beautiful fish:

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.150
flavorful, textured, meaty,

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.150
a bestseller on the menu.

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:34.150
What a fish.

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:37.150
(Laughter)

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:39.150
Even better,

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:42.150
it was farm-raised to the supposed highest standards

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:45.150
of sustainability.

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:48.150
So you could feel good about selling it.

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:51.150
I was in a relationship with this beauty

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:53.150
for several months.

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:57.150
One day, the head of the company called

00:00:57.150 --> 00:00:59.150
and asked if I'd speak at an event

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:01.150
about the farm's sustainability.

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:03.150
"Absolutely," I said.

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:06.150
Here was a company trying to solve

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.150
what's become this unimaginable problem for us chefs:

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:13.150
How do we keep fish on our menus?

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:17.150
For the past 50 years,

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:19.150
we've been fishing the seas

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:22.150
like we clear-cut forests.

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:25.150
It's hard to overstate the destruction.

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:30.150
Ninety percent of large fish, the ones we love --

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.150
the tunas, the halibuts, the salmons, swordfish --

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.150
they've collapsed.

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:38.150
There's almost nothing left.

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:41.150
So, for better or for worse,

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:44.150
aquaculture, fish farming, is going to be a part of our future.

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:46.150
A lot of arguments against it:

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:49.150
Fish farms pollute -- most of them do anyway --

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:51.150
and they're inefficient. Take tuna,

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:53.150
a major drawback.

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:55.150
It's got a feed conversion ratio

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:57.150
of 15 to one.

00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:59.150
That means it takes fifteen pounds of wild fish

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:02.150
to get you one pound of farm tuna.

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:05.150
Not very sustainable.

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:08.150
It doesn't taste very good either.

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:10.150
So here, finally,

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:12.150
was a company trying to do it right.

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:14.150
I wanted to support them.

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:17.150
The day before the event,

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:20.150
I called the head of P.R. for the company.

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:23.150
Let's call him Don.

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:27.150
"Don," I said, "just to get the facts straight, you guys are famous

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:30.150
for farming so far out to sea, you don't pollute."

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:33.150
"That's right," he said. "We're so far out,

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:36.150
the waste from our fish gets distributed,

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:38.150
not concentrated."

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:40.150
And then he added,

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:43.150
"We're basically a world unto ourselves.

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:47.150
That feed conversion ratio? 2.5 to one," he said.

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:49.150
"Best in the business."

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:51.150
2.5 to one, great.

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:53.150
"2.5 what? What are you feeding?"

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:56.150
"Sustainable proteins," he said.

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:59.150
"Great," I said. Got off the phone.

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:02.150
And that night, I was lying in bed, and I thought:

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:04.150
What the hell is a sustainable protein?

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:09.150
(Laughter)

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:11.150
So the next day, just before the event, I called Don.

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:15.150
I said, "Don, what are some examples of sustainable proteins?"

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:18.150
He said he didn't know. He would ask around.

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:20.150
Well, I got on the phone with a few people in the company;

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:23.150
no one could give me a straight answer

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:26.150
until finally, I got on the phone

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:28.150
with the head biologist.

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:30.150
Let's call him Don too.

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:34.150
(Laughter)

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:36.150
"Don," I said,

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:39.150
"what are some examples of sustainable proteins?"

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:41.150
Well, he mentioned some algaes

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:43.150
and some fish meals,

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:45.150
and then he said chicken pellets.

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:47.150
I said, "Chicken pellets?"

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:49.150
He said, "Yeah, feathers, skin,

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:51.150
bone meal, scraps,

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:54.150
dried and processed into feed."

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:56.150
I said, "What percentage

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:59.150
of your feed is chicken?"

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:02.150
Thinking, you know, two percent.

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:05.150
"Well, it's about 30 percent," he said.

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:08.150
I said, "Don, what's sustainable

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:10.150
about feeding chicken to fish?"

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:15.150
(Laughter)

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:18.150
There was a long pause on the line,

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:21.150
and he said, "There's just too much chicken in the world."

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:27.150
(Laughter)

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:29.150
I fell out of love with this fish.

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:31.150
(Laughter)

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:34.150
No, not because I'm some self-righteous,

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:36.150
goody-two shoes foodie.

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:38.150
I actually am.

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:40.150
(Laughter)

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:42.150
No, I actually fell out of love with this fish because, I swear to God,

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:45.150
after that conversation, the fish tasted like chicken.

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:55.150
(Laughter)

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:58.150
This second fish,

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:01.150
it's a different kind of love story.

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:04.150
It's the romantic kind,

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:07.150
the kind where the more you get to know your fish,

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:10.150
you love the fish.

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:12.150
I first ate it at a restaurant

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:14.150
in southern Spain.

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:17.150
A journalist friend had been talking about this fish for a long time.

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:19.150
She kind of set us up.

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:21.150
(Laughter)

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:23.150
It came to the table

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:26.150
a bright, almost shimmering, white color.

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:31.150
The chef had overcooked it.

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:34.150
Like twice over.

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:37.150
Amazingly, it was still delicious.

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:41.150
Who can make a fish taste good

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:43.150
after it's been overcooked?

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:45.150
I can't,

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:47.150
but this guy can.

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:49.150
Let's call him Miguel --

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:51.150
actually his name is Miguel.

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:54.150
(Laughter)

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:56.150
And no, he didn't cook the fish, and he's not a chef,

00:05:56.150 --> 00:05:59.150
at least in the way that you and I understand it.

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:02.150
He's a biologist

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:04.150
at Veta La Palma.

00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:07.150
It's a fish farm in the southwestern corner of Spain.

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:10.150
It's at the tip of the Guadalquivir river.

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:12.150
Until the 1980s,

00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:15.150
the farm was in the hands of the Argentinians.

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:17.150
They raised beef cattle

00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:20.150
on what was essentially wetlands.

00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:22.150
They did it by draining the land.

00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:25.150
They built this intricate series of canals,

00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:28.150
and they pushed water off the land and out into the river.

00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:31.150
Well, they couldn't make it work,

00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:33.150
not economically.

00:06:33.150 --> 00:06:36.150
And ecologically, it was a disaster.

00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:38.150
It killed like 90 percent of the birds,

00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:41.150
which, for this place, is a lot of birds.

00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:43.150
And so in 1982,

00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:45.150
a Spanish company with an environmental conscience

00:06:45.150 --> 00:06:47.150
purchased the land.

00:06:47.150 --> 00:06:49.150
What did they do?

00:06:49.150 --> 00:06:51.150
They reversed the flow of water.

00:06:51.150 --> 00:06:53.150
They literally flipped the switch.

00:06:53.150 --> 00:06:55.150
Instead of pushing water out,

00:06:55.150 --> 00:06:57.150
they used the channels to pull water back in.

00:06:57.150 --> 00:06:59.150
They flooded the canals.

00:06:59.150 --> 00:07:03.150
They created a 27,000-acre fish farm --

00:07:03.150 --> 00:07:05.150
bass, mullet,

00:07:05.150 --> 00:07:07.150
shrimp, eel --

00:07:08.150 --> 00:07:11.150
and in the process, Miguel and this company

00:07:11.150 --> 00:07:14.150
completely reversed the ecological destruction.

00:07:15.150 --> 00:07:17.150
The farm's incredible.

00:07:17.150 --> 00:07:20.150
I mean, you've never seen anything like this.

00:07:20.150 --> 00:07:23.150
You stare out at a horizon

00:07:23.150 --> 00:07:25.150
that is a million miles away,

00:07:25.150 --> 00:07:27.150
and all you see are flooded canals

00:07:27.150 --> 00:07:30.150
and this thick, rich marshland.

00:07:32.150 --> 00:07:35.150
I was there not long ago with Miguel.

00:07:35.150 --> 00:07:38.150
He's an amazing guy,

00:07:38.150 --> 00:07:41.150
like three parts Charles Darwin and one part Crocodile Dundee.

00:07:41.150 --> 00:07:43.150
(Laughter)

00:07:43.150 --> 00:07:46.150
Okay? There we are slogging through the wetlands,

00:07:47.150 --> 00:07:49.150
and I'm panting and sweating, got mud up to my knees,

00:07:49.150 --> 00:07:52.150
and Miguel's calmly conducting a biology lecture.

00:07:53.150 --> 00:07:55.150
Here, he's pointing out a rare Black-shouldered Kite.

00:07:56.150 --> 00:07:59.150
Now, he's mentioning the mineral needs of phytoplankton.

00:08:00.150 --> 00:08:03.150
And here, here he sees a grouping pattern

00:08:03.150 --> 00:08:06.150
that reminds him of the Tanzanian Giraffe.

00:08:08.150 --> 00:08:11.150
It turns out, Miguel spent the better part of his career

00:08:11.150 --> 00:08:14.150
in the Mikumi National Park in Africa.

00:08:14.150 --> 00:08:16.150
I asked him how he became

00:08:16.150 --> 00:08:18.150
such an expert on fish.

00:08:18.150 --> 00:08:21.150
He said, "Fish? I didn't know anything about fish.

00:08:21.150 --> 00:08:24.150
I'm an expert in relationships."

00:08:24.150 --> 00:08:26.150
And then he's off, launching into more talk

00:08:26.150 --> 00:08:28.150
about rare birds and algaes

00:08:28.150 --> 00:08:30.150
and strange aquatic plants.

00:08:30.150 --> 00:08:33.150
And don't get me wrong, that was really fascinating, you know,

00:08:33.150 --> 00:08:36.150
the biotic community unplugged, kind of thing.

00:08:36.150 --> 00:08:39.150
It's great, but I was in love.

00:08:39.150 --> 00:08:42.150
And my head was swooning over that

00:08:42.150 --> 00:08:45.150
overcooked piece of delicious fish I had the night before.

00:08:45.150 --> 00:08:47.150
So I interrupted him. I said,

00:08:47.150 --> 00:08:49.150
"Miguel, what makes your fish taste so good?"

00:08:49.150 --> 00:08:51.150
He pointed at the algae.

00:08:51.150 --> 00:08:54.150
"I know, dude, the algae, the phytoplankton,

00:08:54.150 --> 00:08:57.150
the relationships: It's amazing.

00:08:57.150 --> 00:08:59.150
But what are your fish eating?

00:08:59.150 --> 00:09:02.150
What's the feed conversion ratio?"

00:09:02.150 --> 00:09:05.150
Well, he goes on to tell me

00:09:06.150 --> 00:09:08.150
it's such a rich system

00:09:08.150 --> 00:09:11.150
that the fish are eating what they'd be eating in the wild.

00:09:11.150 --> 00:09:14.150
The plant biomass, the phytoplankton,

00:09:14.150 --> 00:09:16.150
the zooplankton, it's what feeds the fish.

00:09:16.150 --> 00:09:18.150
The system is so healthy,

00:09:18.150 --> 00:09:20.150
it's totally self-renewing.

00:09:20.150 --> 00:09:22.150
There is no feed.

00:09:23.150 --> 00:09:26.150
Ever heard of a farm that doesn't feed its animals?

00:09:30.150 --> 00:09:32.150
Later that day, I was driving around this property with Miguel,

00:09:32.150 --> 00:09:36.150
and I asked him, I said, "For a place that seems so natural,

00:09:36.150 --> 00:09:39.150
unlike like any farm I'd ever been at,

00:09:41.150 --> 00:09:44.150
how do you measure success?"

00:09:44.150 --> 00:09:47.150
At that moment, it was as if

00:09:47.150 --> 00:09:49.150
a film director called for a set change.

00:09:49.150 --> 00:09:51.150
And we rounded the corner

00:09:51.150 --> 00:09:53.150
and saw the most amazing sight:

00:09:53.150 --> 00:09:56.150
thousands and thousands of pink flamingos,

00:09:56.150 --> 00:10:00.150
a literal pink carpet for as far as you could see.

00:10:00.150 --> 00:10:02.150
"That's success," he said.

00:10:03.150 --> 00:10:05.150
"Look at their bellies, pink.

00:10:05.150 --> 00:10:07.150
They're feasting."

00:10:07.150 --> 00:10:09.150
Feasting? I was totally confused.

00:10:09.150 --> 00:10:11.150
I said, "Miguel, aren't they feasting on your fish?"

00:10:11.150 --> 00:10:13.150
(Laughter)

00:10:13.150 --> 00:10:15.150
"Yes," he said.

00:10:15.150 --> 00:10:21.150
(Laughter)

00:10:21.150 --> 00:10:23.150
"We lose 20 percent of our fish

00:10:23.150 --> 00:10:26.150
and fish eggs to birds.

00:10:27.150 --> 00:10:29.150
Well, last year, this property

00:10:29.150 --> 00:10:31.150
had 600,000 birds on it,

00:10:31.150 --> 00:10:33.150
more than 250 different species.

00:10:33.150 --> 00:10:36.150
It's become, today, the largest

00:10:36.150 --> 00:10:39.150
and one of the most important

00:10:39.150 --> 00:10:43.150
private bird sanctuaries in all of Europe."

00:10:43.150 --> 00:10:46.150
I said, "Miguel, isn't a thriving bird population

00:10:46.150 --> 00:10:48.150
like the last thing you want on a fish farm?"

00:10:48.150 --> 00:10:50.150
(Laughter)

00:10:50.150 --> 00:10:52.150
He shook his head, no.

00:10:52.150 --> 00:10:55.150
He said, "We farm extensively,

00:10:55.150 --> 00:10:58.150
not intensively.

00:10:58.150 --> 00:11:01.150
This is an ecological network.

00:11:01.150 --> 00:11:03.150
The flamingos eat the shrimp.

00:11:03.150 --> 00:11:05.150
The shrimp eat the phytoplankton.

00:11:05.150 --> 00:11:07.150
So the pinker the belly,

00:11:07.150 --> 00:11:10.150
the better the system."

00:11:10.150 --> 00:11:12.150
Okay, so let's review:

00:11:12.150 --> 00:11:15.150
a farm that doesn't feed its animals,

00:11:15.150 --> 00:11:18.150
and a farm that measures its success

00:11:18.150 --> 00:11:20.150
on the health of its predators.

00:11:20.150 --> 00:11:23.150
A fish farm, but also a bird sanctuary.

00:11:23.150 --> 00:11:25.150
Oh, and by the way, those flamingos,

00:11:25.150 --> 00:11:27.150
they shouldn't even be there in the first place.

00:11:27.150 --> 00:11:29.150
They brood in a town

00:11:29.150 --> 00:11:31.150
150 miles away,

00:11:31.150 --> 00:11:33.150
where the soil conditions

00:11:33.150 --> 00:11:35.150
are better for building nests.

00:11:35.150 --> 00:11:37.150
Every morning, they fly

00:11:37.150 --> 00:11:39.150
150 miles into the farm.

00:11:41.150 --> 00:11:44.150
And every evening, they fly 150 miles back.

00:11:44.150 --> 00:11:49.150
(Laughter)

00:11:51.150 --> 00:11:54.150
They do that because they're able to follow

00:11:54.150 --> 00:11:56.150
the broken white line

00:11:56.150 --> 00:11:58.150
of highway A92.

00:11:58.150 --> 00:12:00.150
(Laughter)

00:12:00.150 --> 00:12:02.150
No kidding.

00:12:02.150 --> 00:12:05.150
I was imagining a "March of the Penguins" thing,

00:12:05.150 --> 00:12:07.150
so I looked at Miguel.

00:12:07.150 --> 00:12:09.150
I said, "Miguel, do they fly

00:12:09.150 --> 00:12:11.150
150 miles to the farm,

00:12:11.150 --> 00:12:13.150
and then do they fly

00:12:13.150 --> 00:12:15.150
150 miles back at night?

00:12:15.150 --> 00:12:18.150
Do they do that for the children?"

00:12:18.150 --> 00:12:21.150
He looked at me like I had just quoted a Whitney Houston song.

00:12:21.150 --> 00:12:25.150
(Laughter)

00:12:25.150 --> 00:12:28.150
He said, "No; they do it because the food's better."

00:12:28.150 --> 00:12:30.150
(Laughter)

00:12:30.150 --> 00:12:34.150
I didn't mention the skin of my beloved fish,

00:12:38.150 --> 00:12:40.150
which was delicious -- and I don't like fish skin;

00:12:40.150 --> 00:12:43.150
I don't like it seared, I don't like it crispy.

00:12:43.150 --> 00:12:46.150
It's that acrid, tar-like flavor.

00:12:47.150 --> 00:12:49.150
I almost never cook with it.

00:12:50.150 --> 00:12:53.150
Yet, when I tasted it at that restaurant in southern Spain,

00:12:53.150 --> 00:12:56.150
it tasted not at all like fish skin.

00:12:56.150 --> 00:12:59.150
It tasted sweet and clean,

00:12:59.150 --> 00:13:02.150
like you were taking a bite of the ocean.

00:13:02.150 --> 00:13:04.150
I mentioned that to Miguel, and he nodded.

00:13:04.150 --> 00:13:06.150
He said, "The skin acts like a sponge.

00:13:06.150 --> 00:13:09.150
It's the last defense before anything enters the body.

00:13:09.150 --> 00:13:11.150
It evolved to soak up impurities."

00:13:11.150 --> 00:13:13.150
And then he added,

00:13:13.150 --> 00:13:16.150
"But our water has no impurities."

00:13:19.150 --> 00:13:22.150
OK. A farm that doesn't feed its fish,

00:13:23.150 --> 00:13:26.150
a farm that measures its success

00:13:26.150 --> 00:13:28.150
by the success of its predators.

00:13:28.150 --> 00:13:30.150
And then I realized when he says,

00:13:30.150 --> 00:13:33.150
"A farm that has no impurities,"

00:13:33.150 --> 00:13:35.150
he made a big understatement,

00:13:35.150 --> 00:13:37.150
because the water that flows through that farm

00:13:37.150 --> 00:13:40.150
comes in from the Guadalquivir River.

00:13:40.150 --> 00:13:42.150
It's a river that carries with it

00:13:42.150 --> 00:13:45.150
all the things that rivers tend to carry these days:

00:13:45.150 --> 00:13:47.150
chemical contaminants,

00:13:47.150 --> 00:13:49.150
pesticide runoff.

00:13:49.150 --> 00:13:52.150
And when it works its way through the system

00:13:52.150 --> 00:13:54.150
and leaves,

00:13:54.150 --> 00:13:56.150
the water is cleaner than when it entered.

00:13:56.150 --> 00:13:59.150
The system is so healthy, it purifies the water.

00:14:00.150 --> 00:14:02.150
So, not just a farm that doesn't feed its animals,

00:14:02.150 --> 00:14:05.150
not just a farm that measures its success

00:14:05.150 --> 00:14:07.150
by the health of its predators,

00:14:07.150 --> 00:14:10.150
but a farm that's literally a water purification plant --

00:14:13.150 --> 00:14:16.150
and not just for those fish,

00:14:16.150 --> 00:14:18.150
but for you and me as well.

00:14:18.150 --> 00:14:21.150
Because when that water leaves, it dumps out into the Atlantic.

00:14:23.150 --> 00:14:25.150
A drop in the ocean, I know,

00:14:25.150 --> 00:14:28.150
but I'll take it, and so should you,

00:14:28.150 --> 00:14:31.150
because this love story,

00:14:32.150 --> 00:14:34.150
however romantic,

00:14:34.150 --> 00:14:36.150
is also instructive.

00:14:36.150 --> 00:14:38.150
You might say it's a recipe

00:14:38.150 --> 00:14:40.150
for the future of good food,

00:14:40.150 --> 00:14:43.150
whether we're talking about bass or beef cattle.

00:14:44.150 --> 00:14:46.150
What we need now is

00:14:46.150 --> 00:14:49.150
a radically new conception of agriculture,

00:14:49.150 --> 00:14:51.150
one in which the food actually tastes good.

00:14:51.150 --> 00:14:53.150
(Laughter)

00:14:53.150 --> 00:14:59.150
(Applause)

00:14:59.150 --> 00:15:01.150
But for a lot people,

00:15:01.150 --> 00:15:04.150
that's a bit too radical.

00:15:04.150 --> 00:15:06.150
We're not realists, us foodies;

00:15:06.150 --> 00:15:08.150
we're lovers.

00:15:08.150 --> 00:15:10.150
We love farmers' markets,

00:15:10.150 --> 00:15:13.150
we love small family farms,

00:15:13.150 --> 00:15:15.150
we talk about local food,

00:15:15.150 --> 00:15:18.150
we eat organic.

00:15:18.150 --> 00:15:20.150
And when you suggest these are the things

00:15:20.150 --> 00:15:24.150
that will ensure the future of good food,

00:15:24.150 --> 00:15:26.150
someone, somewhere stands up and says,

00:15:26.150 --> 00:15:30.150
"Hey guy, I love pink flamingos,

00:15:30.150 --> 00:15:33.150
but how are you going to feed the world?"

00:15:33.150 --> 00:15:36.150
How are you going to feed the world?

00:15:36.150 --> 00:15:38.150
Can I be honest?

00:15:38.150 --> 00:15:41.150
I don't love that question.

00:15:41.150 --> 00:15:43.150
No, not because we already produce

00:15:43.150 --> 00:15:46.150
enough calories to more than feed the world.

00:15:46.150 --> 00:15:49.150
One billion people will go hungry today.

00:15:49.150 --> 00:15:52.150
One billion -- that's more than ever before --

00:15:53.150 --> 00:15:56.150
because of gross inequalities in distribution,

00:15:56.150 --> 00:15:58.150
not tonnage.

00:15:59.150 --> 00:16:01.150
Now, I don't love this question because it's determined the logic

00:16:01.150 --> 00:16:04.150
of our food system for the last 50 years.

00:16:04.150 --> 00:16:07.150
Feed grain to herbivores,

00:16:07.150 --> 00:16:09.150
pesticides to monocultures, chemicals to soil,

00:16:09.150 --> 00:16:12.150
chicken to fish,

00:16:12.150 --> 00:16:15.150
and all along agribusiness

00:16:15.150 --> 00:16:17.150
has simply asked,

00:16:17.150 --> 00:16:19.150
"If we're feeding more people more cheaply,

00:16:19.150 --> 00:16:22.150
how terrible could that be?"

00:16:22.150 --> 00:16:24.150
That's been the motivation,

00:16:24.150 --> 00:16:26.150
it's been the justification:

00:16:26.150 --> 00:16:29.150
it's been the business plan

00:16:29.150 --> 00:16:31.150
of American agriculture.

00:16:31.150 --> 00:16:33.150
We should call it what it is:

00:16:33.150 --> 00:16:36.150
a business in liquidation,

00:16:36.150 --> 00:16:39.150
a business that's quickly eroding

00:16:39.150 --> 00:16:42.150
ecological capital that makes that very production possible.

00:16:42.150 --> 00:16:44.150
That's not a business,

00:16:44.150 --> 00:16:46.150
and it isn't agriculture.

00:16:46.150 --> 00:16:49.150
Our breadbasket is threatened today,

00:16:49.150 --> 00:16:51.150
not because of diminishing supply,

00:16:51.150 --> 00:16:54.150
but because of diminishing resources.

00:16:54.150 --> 00:16:57.150
Not by the latest combine and tractor invention,

00:16:57.150 --> 00:16:59.150
but by fertile land;

00:16:59.150 --> 00:17:02.150
not by pumps, but by fresh water;

00:17:02.150 --> 00:17:05.150
not by chainsaws, but by forests;

00:17:05.150 --> 00:17:08.150
and not by fishing boats and nets, but by fish in the sea.

00:17:08.150 --> 00:17:10.150
Want to feed the world?

00:17:10.150 --> 00:17:13.150
Let's start by asking: How are we going to feed ourselves?

00:17:14.150 --> 00:17:17.150
Or better: How can we create conditions

00:17:17.150 --> 00:17:20.150
that enable every community

00:17:20.150 --> 00:17:22.150
to feed itself?

00:17:22.150 --> 00:17:29.150
(Applause)

00:17:29.150 --> 00:17:31.150
To do that,

00:17:31.150 --> 00:17:34.150
don't look at the agribusiness model for the future.

00:17:34.150 --> 00:17:36.150
It's really old, and it's tired.

00:17:36.150 --> 00:17:40.150
It's high on capital, chemistry and machines,

00:17:40.150 --> 00:17:43.150
and it's never produced anything really good to eat.

00:17:45.150 --> 00:17:49.150
Instead, let's look to the ecological model.

00:17:49.150 --> 00:17:52.150
That's the one that relies on two billion years

00:17:52.150 --> 00:17:55.150
of on-the-job experience.

00:17:55.150 --> 00:17:57.150
Look to Miguel,

00:17:57.150 --> 00:17:59.150
farmers like Miguel.

00:17:59.150 --> 00:18:02.150
Farms that aren't worlds unto themselves;

00:18:02.150 --> 00:18:07.150
farms that restore instead of deplete;

00:18:07.150 --> 00:18:09.150
farms that farm extensively

00:18:09.150 --> 00:18:11.150
instead of just intensively;

00:18:11.150 --> 00:18:14.150
farmers that are not just producers,

00:18:14.150 --> 00:18:16.150
but experts in relationships.

00:18:16.150 --> 00:18:18.150
Because they're the ones

00:18:18.150 --> 00:18:21.150
that are experts in flavor, too.

00:18:21.150 --> 00:18:23.150
And if I'm going to be really honest,

00:18:23.150 --> 00:18:26.150
they're a better chef than I'll ever be.

00:18:26.150 --> 00:18:29.150
You know, I'm okay with that,

00:18:29.150 --> 00:18:32.150
because if that's the future of good food, it's going to be delicious.

00:18:32.150 --> 00:18:34.150
Thank you.

00:18:34.150 --> 00:18:51.150
(Applause)
