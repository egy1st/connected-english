00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:17.150
I want to talk about 4.6 billion years of history

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:19.150
in 18 minutes.

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:22.150
That's 300 million years per minute.

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:26.150
Let's start with the first photograph NASA obtained

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:28.150
of planet Mars.

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:30.150
This is fly-by, Mariner IV.

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:33.150
It was taken in 1965.

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:35.150
When this picture appeared,

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:38.150
that well-known scientific journal,

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:41.150
The New York Times, wrote in its editorial,

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:43.150
"Mars is uninteresting.

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:46.150
It's a dead world. NASA should not spend

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:50.150
any time or effort studying Mars anymore."

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:52.150
Fortunately, our leaders in Washington

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:54.150
at NASA headquarters knew better

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:58.150
and we began a very extensive study

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:00.150
of the red planet.

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:04.150
One of the key questions in all of science,

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:06.150
"Is there life outside of Earth?"

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:10.150
I believe that Mars is the most likely target

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:12.150
for life outside the Earth.

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.150
I'm going to show you in a few minutes

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:16.150
some amazing measurements that suggest

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:18.150
there may be life on Mars.

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:22.150
But let me start with a Viking photograph.

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:26.150
This is a composite taken by Viking in 1976.

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:29.150
Viking was developed and managed at the

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:31.150
NASA Langley Research Center.

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:35.150
We sent two orbiters and two landers in the summer of 1976.

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:39.150
We had four spacecraft, two around Mars,

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.150
two on the surface --

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:43.150
an amazing accomplishment.

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:45.150
This is the first photograph taken from

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:47.150
the surface of any planet.

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:49.150
This is a Viking Lander photograph

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:51.150
of the surface of Mars.

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:54.150
And yes, the red planet is red.

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:57.150
Mars is half the size of the Earth,

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:00.150
but because two-thirds of the Earth is covered by water,

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:03.150
the land area on Mars

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:05.150
is comparable to the land area on Earth.

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:10.150
So, Mars is a pretty big place even though it's half the size.

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:13.150
We have obtained topographic measurements

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:15.150
of the surface of Mars. We understand

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:17.150
the elevation differences.

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:19.150
We know a lot about Mars.

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:23.150
Mars has the largest volcano in the solar system,

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:25.150
Olympus Mons.

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:27.150
Mars has the Grand Canyon

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:30.150
of the solar system, Valles Marineris.

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:32.150
Very, very interesting planet.

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:35.150
Mars has the largest

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:37.150
impact crater in the solar system,

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:39.150
Hellas Basin.

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:41.150
This is 2,000 miles across.

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:43.150
If you happened to be on Mars

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:45.150
when this impactor hit,

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:47.150
it was a really bad day on Mars.

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:49.150
(Laughter)

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:51.150
This is Olympus Mons.

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:54.150
This is bigger than the state of Arizona.

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:56.150
Volcanoes are important, because volcanoes

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:59.150
produce atmospheres and they produce oceans.

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:02.150
We're looking at Valles Marineris,

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:04.150
the largest canyon in the solar system,

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:07.150
superimposed on a map of the United States,

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:09.150
3,000 miles across.

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:12.150
One of the most intriguing features about Mars,

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:14.150
the National Academy of Science says

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:17.150
one of the 10 major mysteries of the space age,

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:20.150
is why certain areas of Mars

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:22.150
are so highly magnetized.

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:24.150
We call this crustal magnetism.

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:27.150
There are regions on Mars, where, for some reason --

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:30.150
we don't understand why at this point --

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:33.150
the surface is very, very highly magnetized.

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:35.150
Is there water on Mars?

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:38.150
The answer is no, there is no liquid water

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:40.150
on the surface of Mars today.

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:42.150
But there is intriguing evidence

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:45.150
that suggests that the early history of Mars

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:47.150
there may have been rivers

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:50.150
and fast flowing water.

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:52.150
Today Mars is very very dry.

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:55.150
We believe there's some water in the polar caps,

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:58.150
there are polar caps of North Pole and South Pole.

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:00.150
Here are some recent images.

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:03.150
This is from Spirit and Opportunity.

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:05.150
These images that show at one time,

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:09.150
there was very fast flowing water on the surface of Mars.

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:11.150
Why is water important? Water is important

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:15.150
because if you want life you have to have water.

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:17.150
Water is the key ingredient

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:21.150
in the evolution, the origin of life on a planet.

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:23.150
Here is some picture of Antarctica

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:26.150
and a picture of Olympus Mons,

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:28.150
very similar features, glaciers.

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:30.150
So, this is frozen water.

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:33.150
This is ice water on Mars.

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:36.150
This is my favorite picture. This was just taken a few weeks ago.

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:38.150
It has not been seen publicly.

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:41.150
This is European space agency

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:43.150
Mars Express, image of a crater on Mars

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:45.150
and in the middle of the crater

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:48.150
we have liquid water, we have ice.

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:50.150
Very intriguing photograph.

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:54.150
We now believe that in the early history of Mars,

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:57.150
which is 4.6 billion years ago,

00:04:57.150 --> 00:05:01.150
4.6 billion years ago, Mars was very Earth-like.

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:04.150
Mars had rivers, Mars had lakes,

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:08.150
but more important Mars had planetary-scale oceans.

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:12.150
We believe that the oceans were in the northern hemisphere,

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:14.150
and this area in blue,

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:17.150
which shows a depression of about four miles,

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:20.150
was the ancient ocean area

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:22.150
on the surface of Mars.

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:25.150
Where did the ocean's worth of water on Mars go?

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:27.150
Well, we have an idea.

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:30.150
This is a measurement we obtained a few years ago

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:34.150
from a Mars-orbiting satellite called Odyssey.

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:36.150
Sub-surface water on Mars,

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:39.150
frozen in the form of ice.

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:42.150
And this shows the percent. If it's a blueish color,

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:45.150
it means 16 percent by weight.

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:47.150
Sixteen percent, by weight, of the interior

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:50.150
contains frozen water, or ice.

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:53.150
So, there is a lot of water below the surface.

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:57.150
The most intriguing and puzzling measurement,

00:05:57.150 --> 00:06:00.150
in my opinion, we've obtained of Mars,

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:03.150
was released earlier this year

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:06.150
in the magazine Science.

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:10.150
And what we're looking at is the presence of the gas methane,

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:14.150
CH4, in the atmosphere of Mars.

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:18.150
And you can see there are three distinct regions of methane.

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:20.150
Why is methane important?

00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:22.150
Because on Earth, almost all --

00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:25.150
99.9 percent -- of the methane

00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:28.150
is produced by living systems,

00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:32.150
not little green men, but microscopic life

00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:34.150
below the surface or at the surface.

00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:36.150
We now have evidence

00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:39.150
that methane is in the atmosphere of Mars,

00:06:39.150 --> 00:06:41.150
a gas that, on Earth,

00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:43.150
is biogenic in origin,

00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:45.150
produced by living systems.

00:06:45.150 --> 00:06:49.150
These are the three plumes: A, B1, B2.

00:06:49.150 --> 00:06:52.150
And this is the terrain it appears over,

00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:55.150
and we know from geological studies

00:06:55.150 --> 00:06:59.150
that these regions are the oldest regions on Mars.

00:06:59.150 --> 00:07:01.150
In fact, the Earth and Mars

00:07:01.150 --> 00:07:05.150
are both 4.6 billion years old.

00:07:05.150 --> 00:07:09.150
The oldest rock on Earth is only 3.6 billion.

00:07:09.150 --> 00:07:12.150
The reason there is a billion-year gap

00:07:12.150 --> 00:07:14.150
in our geological understanding

00:07:14.150 --> 00:07:16.150
is because of plate tectonics,

00:07:16.150 --> 00:07:19.150
The crust of the Earth has been recycled.

00:07:19.150 --> 00:07:21.150
We have no geological record prior

00:07:21.150 --> 00:07:23.150
for the first billion years.

00:07:23.150 --> 00:07:25.150
That record exists on Mars.

00:07:25.150 --> 00:07:27.150
And this terrain that we're looking at

00:07:27.150 --> 00:07:31.150
dates back to 4.6 billion years

00:07:31.150 --> 00:07:34.150
when Earth and Mars were formed.

00:07:34.150 --> 00:07:36.150
It was a Tuesday.

00:07:36.150 --> 00:07:38.150
(Laughter)

00:07:38.150 --> 00:07:40.150
This is a map that shows

00:07:40.150 --> 00:07:44.150
where we've put our spacecraft on the surface of Mars.

00:07:44.150 --> 00:07:47.150
Here is Viking I, Viking II.

00:07:47.150 --> 00:07:50.150
This is Opportunity. This is Spirit.

00:07:50.150 --> 00:07:52.150
This is Mars Pathfinder. This is Phoenix,

00:07:52.150 --> 00:07:54.150
we just put two years ago.

00:07:54.150 --> 00:07:58.150
Notice all of our rovers and all of our landers

00:07:58.150 --> 00:08:00.150
have gone to the northern hemisphere.

00:08:00.150 --> 00:08:03.150
That's because the northern hemisphere

00:08:03.150 --> 00:08:05.150
is the region of the ancient

00:08:05.150 --> 00:08:07.150
ocean basin.

00:08:07.150 --> 00:08:09.150
There aren't many craters.

00:08:09.150 --> 00:08:12.150
And that's because the water protected the basin

00:08:12.150 --> 00:08:16.150
from being impacted by asteroids and meteorites.

00:08:16.150 --> 00:08:19.150
But look in the southern hemisphere.

00:08:19.150 --> 00:08:21.150
In the southern hemisphere there are impact craters,

00:08:21.150 --> 00:08:23.150
there are volcanic craters.

00:08:23.150 --> 00:08:25.150
Here's Hellas Basin,

00:08:25.150 --> 00:08:28.150
a very very different place, geologically.

00:08:28.150 --> 00:08:31.150
Look where the methane is, the methane is in a very

00:08:31.150 --> 00:08:35.150
rough terrain area.

00:08:35.150 --> 00:08:37.150
What is the best way to unravel

00:08:37.150 --> 00:08:40.150
the mysteries on Mars that exist?

00:08:40.150 --> 00:08:44.150
We asked this question 10 years ago.

00:08:44.150 --> 00:08:47.150
We invited 10 of the top Mars scientists

00:08:47.150 --> 00:08:51.150
to the Langley Research Center for two days.

00:08:51.150 --> 00:08:53.150
We addressed on the board

00:08:53.150 --> 00:08:56.150
the major questions that have not been answered.

00:08:56.150 --> 00:08:59.150
And we spent two days deciding

00:08:59.150 --> 00:09:02.150
how to best answer this question.

00:09:02.150 --> 00:09:05.150
And the result of our meeting

00:09:05.150 --> 00:09:11.150
was a robotic rocket-powered airplane we call ARES.

00:09:11.150 --> 00:09:15.150
It's an Aerial Regional-scale Environmental Surveyor.

00:09:15.150 --> 00:09:17.150
There's a model of ARES here.

00:09:17.150 --> 00:09:20.150
This is a 20-percent scale model.

00:09:20.150 --> 00:09:24.150
This airplane was designed at the Langley Research Center.

00:09:24.150 --> 00:09:26.150
If any place in the world

00:09:26.150 --> 00:09:28.150
can build an airplane to fly on Mars,

00:09:28.150 --> 00:09:30.150
it's the Langley Research Center,

00:09:30.150 --> 00:09:32.150
for almost 100 years

00:09:32.150 --> 00:09:35.150
a leading center of aeronautics in the world.

00:09:35.150 --> 00:09:38.150
We fly about a mile above the surface.

00:09:38.150 --> 00:09:40.150
We cover hundreds of miles,

00:09:40.150 --> 00:09:43.150
and we fly about 450 miles an hour.

00:09:43.150 --> 00:09:46.150
We can do things that rovers can't do

00:09:46.150 --> 00:09:48.150
and landers can't do:

00:09:48.150 --> 00:09:51.150
We can fly above mountains, volcanoes, impact craters;

00:09:51.150 --> 00:09:53.150
we fly over valleys;

00:09:53.150 --> 00:09:55.150
we can fly over surface magnetism,

00:09:55.150 --> 00:09:58.150
the polar caps, subsurface water;

00:09:58.150 --> 00:10:00.150
and we can search for life on Mars.

00:10:00.150 --> 00:10:02.150
But, of equal importance,

00:10:02.150 --> 00:10:05.150
as we fly through the atmosphere of Mars,

00:10:05.150 --> 00:10:08.150
we transmit that journey,

00:10:08.150 --> 00:10:11.150
the first flight of an airplane outside of the Earth,

00:10:11.150 --> 00:10:14.150
we transmit those images back to Earth.

00:10:14.150 --> 00:10:18.150
And our goal is to inspire the American public

00:10:18.150 --> 00:10:21.150
who is paying for this mission through tax dollars.

00:10:21.150 --> 00:10:24.150
But more important we will

00:10:24.150 --> 00:10:27.150
inspire the next generation of scientists,

00:10:27.150 --> 00:10:30.150
technologists, engineers and mathematicians.

00:10:30.150 --> 00:10:34.150
And that's a critical area of national security

00:10:34.150 --> 00:10:38.150
and economic vitality, to make sure

00:10:38.150 --> 00:10:40.150
we produce the next generation

00:10:40.150 --> 00:10:43.150
of scientists, engineers, mathematicians and technologists.

00:10:43.150 --> 00:10:46.150
This is what ARES looks like

00:10:46.150 --> 00:10:48.150
as it flies over Mars.

00:10:48.150 --> 00:10:50.150
We preprogram it.

00:10:50.150 --> 00:10:52.150
We will fly where the methane is.

00:10:52.150 --> 00:10:55.150
We will have instruments aboard the plane

00:10:55.150 --> 00:10:58.150
that will sample, every three minutes, the atmosphere of Mars.

00:10:58.150 --> 00:11:00.150
We will look for methane

00:11:00.150 --> 00:11:02.150
as well as other gasses

00:11:02.150 --> 00:11:04.150
produced by living systems.

00:11:04.150 --> 00:11:08.150
We will pinpoint where these gases emanate from,

00:11:08.150 --> 00:11:11.150
because we can measure the gradient where it comes from,

00:11:11.150 --> 00:11:14.150
and there, we can direct the next mission

00:11:14.150 --> 00:11:17.150
to land right in that area.

00:11:17.150 --> 00:11:20.150
How do we transport an airplane to Mars?

00:11:20.150 --> 00:11:23.150
In two words, very carefully.

00:11:23.150 --> 00:11:27.150
The problem is we don't fly it to Mars,

00:11:27.150 --> 00:11:30.150
we put it in a spacecraft

00:11:30.150 --> 00:11:32.150
and we send it to Mars.

00:11:32.150 --> 00:11:34.150
The problem is the spacecraft's

00:11:34.150 --> 00:11:38.150
largest diameter is nine feet;

00:11:38.150 --> 00:11:43.150
ARES is 21-foot wingspan, 17 feet long.

00:11:43.150 --> 00:11:45.150
How do we get it to Mars?

00:11:45.150 --> 00:11:47.150
We fold it,

00:11:47.150 --> 00:11:50.150
and we transport it in a spacecraft.

00:11:50.150 --> 00:11:53.150
And we have it in something called an aeroshell.

00:11:53.150 --> 00:11:55.150
This is how we do it.

00:11:55.150 --> 00:11:59.150
And we have a little video that describes the sequence.

00:11:59.150 --> 00:12:04.150
Video: Seven, six. Green board. Five, four, three, two, one.

00:12:04.150 --> 00:12:07.150
Main engine start, and liftoff.

00:12:17.150 --> 00:12:20.150
Joel Levine: This is a launch from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida.

00:12:26.150 --> 00:12:28.150
This is the spacecraft taking nine months

00:12:28.150 --> 00:12:30.150
to get to Mars.

00:12:30.150 --> 00:12:33.150
It enters the atmosphere of Mars.

00:12:33.150 --> 00:12:35.150
A lot of heating,

00:12:38.150 --> 00:12:40.150
frictional heating. It's going 18 thousand miles an hour.

00:12:40.150 --> 00:12:44.150
A parachute opens up to slow it down.

00:12:44.150 --> 00:12:47.150
The thermal tiles fall off.

00:12:47.150 --> 00:12:50.150
The airplane is exposed to the atmosphere for the first time.

00:12:50.150 --> 00:12:53.150
It unfolds.

00:12:53.150 --> 00:12:55.150
The rocket engine begins.

00:13:02.150 --> 00:13:05.150
We believe that in a one-hour flight

00:13:05.150 --> 00:13:08.150
we can rewrite the textbook on Mars

00:13:08.150 --> 00:13:11.150
by making high-resolution measurements of the atmosphere,

00:13:11.150 --> 00:13:14.150
looking for gases of biogenic origin,

00:13:14.150 --> 00:13:17.150
looking for gases of volcanic origin,

00:13:17.150 --> 00:13:20.150
studying the surface, studying the magnetism

00:13:20.150 --> 00:13:22.150
on the surface, which we don't understand,

00:13:22.150 --> 00:13:25.150
as well as about a dozen other areas.

00:13:25.150 --> 00:13:27.150
Practice makes perfect.

00:13:27.150 --> 00:13:29.150
How do we know we can do it?

00:13:29.150 --> 00:13:33.150
Because we have tested ARES model,

00:13:33.150 --> 00:13:36.150
several models in a half a dozen wind tunnels

00:13:36.150 --> 00:13:39.150
at the NASA Langley Research Center for eight years,

00:13:39.150 --> 00:13:41.150
under Mars conditions.

00:13:41.150 --> 00:13:43.150
And, of equal importance

00:13:43.150 --> 00:13:47.150
is, we test ARES in the Earth's atmosphere,

00:13:47.150 --> 00:13:50.150
at 100,000 feet,

00:13:50.150 --> 00:13:53.150
which is comparable to the density and pressure

00:13:53.150 --> 00:13:56.150
of the atmosphere on Mars where we'll fly.

00:13:56.150 --> 00:13:59.150
Now, 100,000 feet, if you fly cross-country to Los Angeles,

00:13:59.150 --> 00:14:01.150
you fly 37,000 feet.

00:14:01.150 --> 00:14:04.150
We do our tests at 100,000 feet.

00:14:04.150 --> 00:14:07.150
And I want to show you one of our tests.

00:14:07.150 --> 00:14:09.150
This is a half-scale model.

00:14:09.150 --> 00:14:11.150
This is a high-altitude helium balloon.

00:14:11.150 --> 00:14:14.150
This is over Tilamook, Oregon.

00:14:14.150 --> 00:14:18.150
We put the folded airplane on the balloon --

00:14:18.150 --> 00:14:20.150
it took about three hours to get up there --

00:14:20.150 --> 00:14:22.150
and then we released it on command

00:14:22.150 --> 00:14:24.150
at 103,000 feet,

00:14:24.150 --> 00:14:28.150
and we deploy the airplane and everything works perfectly.

00:14:28.150 --> 00:14:30.150
And we've done

00:14:30.150 --> 00:14:32.150
high-altitude and low-altitude tests,

00:14:32.150 --> 00:14:37.150
just to perfect this technique.

00:14:37.150 --> 00:14:39.150
We're ready to go.

00:14:39.150 --> 00:14:41.150
I have a scale model here.

00:14:41.150 --> 00:14:43.150
But we have a full-scale model

00:14:43.150 --> 00:14:46.150
in storage at the NASA Langley Research Center.

00:14:46.150 --> 00:14:50.150
We're ready to go. All we need is a check from NASA headquarters

00:14:50.150 --> 00:14:52.150
(Laughter)

00:14:52.150 --> 00:14:54.150
to cover the costs.

00:14:54.150 --> 00:14:57.150
I'm prepared to donate my honorarium for today's talk

00:14:57.150 --> 00:14:59.150
for this mission.

00:14:59.150 --> 00:15:03.150
There's actually no honorarium for anyone for this thing.

00:15:03.150 --> 00:15:05.150
This is the ARES team;

00:15:05.150 --> 00:15:09.150
we have about 150 scientists, engineers;

00:15:09.150 --> 00:15:11.150
where we're working with Jet Propulsion Laboratory,

00:15:11.150 --> 00:15:13.150
Goddard Space Flight Center,

00:15:13.150 --> 00:15:16.150
Ames Research Center and half a dozen major universities

00:15:16.150 --> 00:15:18.150
and corporations in developing this.

00:15:18.150 --> 00:15:25.150
It's a large effort. It's all at NASA Langley Research Center.

00:15:25.150 --> 00:15:28.150
And let me conclude by saying

00:15:28.150 --> 00:15:30.150
not too far from here,

00:15:30.150 --> 00:15:33.150
right down the road in Kittyhawk, North Carolina,

00:15:33.150 --> 00:15:35.150
a little more than 100 years ago

00:15:35.150 --> 00:15:37.150
history was made

00:15:37.150 --> 00:15:40.150
when we had the first powered flight of an airplane on Earth.

00:15:40.150 --> 00:15:42.150
We are on the verge right now

00:15:42.150 --> 00:15:45.150
to make the first flight of an airplane

00:15:45.150 --> 00:15:47.150
outside the Earth's atmosphere.

00:15:47.150 --> 00:15:50.150
We are prepared to fly this on Mars,

00:15:50.150 --> 00:15:52.150
rewrite the textbook about Mars.

00:15:52.150 --> 00:15:55.150
If you're interested in more information,

00:15:55.150 --> 00:15:58.150
we have a website that describes this exciting

00:15:58.150 --> 00:16:01.150
and intriguing mission, and why we want to do it.

00:16:01.150 --> 00:16:03.150
Thank you very much.

00:16:03.150 --> 00:16:06.150
(Applause)
