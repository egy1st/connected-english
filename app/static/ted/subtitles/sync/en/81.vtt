00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.150
I'd like to begin this song I wrote

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:20.150
about ceaseless yearning and never-ending want

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:25.150
with a poem of popular Petrarchan paradoxes

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:28.150
by Sir Thomas Wyatt the Elder:

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:33.150
"I find no peace, and all my war is done;

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:40.150
I fear and hope, I burn and freeze like ice;

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:43.150
I fly above the wind,

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:46.150
and yet I cannot arise;

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:49.150
And naught I have,

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:53.150
and all the world I seize upon."

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:00.150
♫ I want what I can't have, need what I can't want ♫

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:02.150
♫ Have what I don't have, what I want ♫

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:04.150
♫ What I can't have, need what I can't want ♫

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:06.150
♫ Have what I don't have, what I want ♫

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.150
♫ What I can't have, need what I can't want ♫

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:10.150
♫ Have what I don't have, what I want ♫

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:12.150
♫ What I can't have, need what I can't want ♫

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.150
♫ Have what I don't have, what I want ♫

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.150
♫ What I can't have, need what I can't want ♫

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:18.150
♫ Have but I don't have ♫

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.150
♫ It feels like all I got is loss on a bad back ♫

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:22.150
♫ Gone with the last train, honey don't you fret ♫

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:24.150
♫ Every cloud has a silver lining ♫

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:28.150
♫ Just a little rain, just a little rain, just a little rain ♫

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:31.150
♫ I want what I can't have, need what I can't want ♫

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:33.150
♫ Have what I don't have, what I want ♫

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.150
♫ What I can't have, need what I can't want ♫

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:38.150
♫ Have but I don't have ♫

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:41.150
♫ My mind won't stop, and my heart says go ♫

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:46.150
♫ Nobody knows how to hold me ♫

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:49.150
♫ My mind won't stop, and my heart says, ♫

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:53.150
♫ "Good things come to those who wait" ♫

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:56.150
♫ And I can't stand in ... ♫

00:01:56.150 --> 00:02:00.150
♫ I can't stand in line forever ♫

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:03.150
♫ Stand the cold air ♫

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:05.150
♫ Glad-handed ♫

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:09.150
♫ Sick and tired of the "Later, maybe" ♫

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:13.150
♫ Take it, fake it, take it, take-it-or-leave-it life ♫

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:15.150
♫ And I gotta just tame it ♫

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:17.150
♫ I gotta just name it ♫

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:20.150
♫ I gotta just seize, so please, oh please, oh please, oh please ♫

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:22.150
♫ Oh please me right, 'cause ♫

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:24.150
♫ My mind won't stop ♫

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:27.150
♫ And my heart says go ♫

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:30.150
♫ Nobody knows how to hold me ♫

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:35.150
♫ My mind won't stop -- and my heart says go-ooooo ... ♫

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:57.150
♫ Good things must be here -- yes, right here ♫

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:00.150
♫ Here, right here, right here ♫

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:05.150
♫ I won't live this life forever ♫

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:09.150
♫ One time round is all the offer is ♫

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:13.150
♫ Sick and tired of the "Later, maybe" ♫

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:17.150
♫ Take it, fake it, make it, leave it life ♫

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:20.150
♫ And I gotta just name it, I gotta just claim it ♫

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:22.150
♫ I gotta just seize ♫

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:25.150
♫ Oh please, oh please, oh please me right ♫

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:28.150
♫ I want what I can't have, need what I can't want ♫

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:30.150
♫ Have what I don't have, what I want ♫

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:32.150
♫ What I can't have, need what I can't want ♫

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:34.150
♫ Have but I don't have -- you know that ♫

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:38.150
♫ My mind won't stop, and my heart says go ♫

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:42.150
♫ Nobody knows how to hold me, no ♫

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:47.150
♫ My mind won't stop, and my heart says go ♫

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:51.150
♫ 'Cause I want what I can't have, need what I can't want ♫

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:55.150
♫ Have but I -- have what I want ♫

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:57.150
♫ What I can't have, need what I can't want ♫

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:00.150
♫ What I can't have, need what I can't want ♫

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:02.150
♫ Have but I don't have, what I want ♫

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:04.150
♫ What I can't have, need what I can't want ♫

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:06.150
♫ Have what I don't have, what I want ♫

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:08.150
♫ What I can't have, need what I can't want ♫

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:10.150
♫ Have but I don't have, what I want ♫

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:12.150
♫ What I can't have, need what I can't want ♫

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:14.150
♫ Have but I don't have what I want ♫

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:23.150
(Applause)
