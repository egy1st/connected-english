00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.150
Thank you. I have two missions here today.

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:19.150
The first is to tell you something about pollen, I hope,

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:22.150
and to convince you that it's more than just something that gets up your nose.

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:24.150
And, secondly, to convince you

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.150
that every home really ought to have a scanning electron microscope.

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.150
(Laughter)

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:33.150
Pollen is a flower's way of making more flowers.

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:35.150
It carries male sex cells

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:37.150
from one flower to another.

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:39.150
This gives us genetic diversity,

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:41.150
or at least it gives the plants genetic diversity.

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:45.150
And it's really rather better not to mate with yourself.

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:49.150
That's probably true of humans as well, mostly.

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:51.150
Pollen is produced by the anthers of flowers.

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:56.150
Each anther can carry up to 100,000 grains of pollen,

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:58.150
so, it's quite prolific stuff.

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:00.150
And it isn't just bright flowers

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:04.150
that have pollen; it's also trees and grasses.

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:07.150
And remember that all our cereal crops are grasses as well.

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:13.150
Here is a scanning electron micrograph of a grain of pollen.

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:16.150
The little hole in the middle, we'll come to a bit later,

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:18.150
but that's for the pollen tube

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.150
to come out later on. A very tiny tube.

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:22.150
So, that's 20 micrometers across,

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:24.150
that pollen grain there.

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.150
That's about a 50th of a millimeter.

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:29.150
But not all pollen is quite so simple looking.

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:32.150
This is Morina. This is a plant --

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:34.150
which I've always thought to be rather tedious --

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:36.150
named after Morin,

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.150
who was an enterprising French gardener,

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:40.150
who issued the first seed catalog

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:42.150
in 1621.

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:45.150
But anyway, take a look at its pollen.

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:48.150
This is amazing, I think.

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:50.150
That little hole in the middle there is for the pollen tube,

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:53.150
and when the pollen finds its special female spot

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:55.150
in another Morina flower,

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:58.150
just on the right species, what happens?

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:01.150
Like I said, pollen carries the male sex cells.

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:04.150
If you actually didn't realize that plants have sex,

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:06.150
they have rampant, promiscuous

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:08.150
and really quite interesting and curious sex. Really.

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:12.150
(Laughter) A lot.

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:15.150
My story is actually not about plant propagation,

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:17.150
but about pollen itself.

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:20.150
"So, what are pollen's properties?" I hear you ask.

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:22.150
First of all, pollen is tiny. Yes we know that.

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:24.150
It's also very biologically active,

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:26.150
as anyone with hay fever will understand.

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:29.150
Now, pollen from plants, which are wind-dispersed --

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:32.150
like trees and grasses and so on --

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:34.150
tend to cause the most hay fever.

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:36.150
And the reason for that is they've got to chuck out

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:38.150
masses and masses of pollen to have any chance

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:42.150
of the pollen reaching another plant of the same species.

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:44.150
Here are some examples --

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:47.150
they're very smooth if you look at them --

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:50.150
of tree pollen that is meant to be carried by the wind.

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:52.150
Again -- this time, sycamore -- wind-dispersed.

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:55.150
So, trees: very boring flowers,

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:58.150
not really trying to attract insects.

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:00.150
Cool pollen, though.

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:02.150
This one I particularly like.

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:05.150
This is the Monterey Pine, which has little air sacks

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:07.150
to make the pollen carry even further.

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:11.150
Remember, that thing is just about 30 micrometers across.

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:14.150
Now, it's much more efficient if you can get insects to do your bidding.

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:17.150
This is a bee's leg

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:21.150
with the pollen glommed onto it from a mallow plant.

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:23.150
And this is the outrageous and beautiful

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:25.150
flower of the mangrove palm.

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:28.150
Very showy, to attract lots of insects to do its bidding.

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:30.150
The pollen has little barbs on it,

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:32.150
if we look.

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:34.150
Now, those little barbs

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:37.150
obviously stick to the insects well,

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:39.150
but there is something else that we can tell from this photograph,

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:41.150
and that is that you might be able to see a fracture line

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:44.150
across what would be the equator of this, if it was the Earth.

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:47.150
That tells me that it's actually been fossilized, this pollen.

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:49.150
And I'm rather proud to say

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:52.150
that this was found just near London, and that 55 million years ago

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:55.150
London was full of mangroves.

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:57.150
Isn't that cool?

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:00.150
(Laughter)

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:03.150
Okay, so this is another species evolved to be dispersed by insects.

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:06.150
You can tell that from the little barbs on there.

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:09.150
All these pictures were taken with a scanning electron microscope,

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:11.150
actually in the lab at Kew Laboratories.

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:13.150
No coincidence that these were taken

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:15.150
by Rob Kesseler, who is an artist,

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:18.150
and I think it's someone with a design and artistic eye

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:22.150
like him that has managed to bring out the best in pollen.

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:24.150
(Laughter)

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:26.150
Now, all this diversity

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:28.150
means that you can look at a pollen grain

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:31.150
and tell what species it came from,

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:33.150
and that's actually quite handy if you

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:36.150
maybe have a sample and you want to see where it came from.

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:38.150
So, different species of plants

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:40.150
grow in different places,

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:44.150
and some pollen carries further than others.

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:47.150
So, if you have a pollen sample,

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:49.150
then in principle, you should be able to tell

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:51.150
where that sample came from.

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:54.150
And this is where it gets interesting for forensics.

00:04:56.150 --> 00:05:00.150
Pollen is tiny. It gets on to things, and it sticks to them.

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:02.150
So, not only does each type of pollen look different,

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:06.150
but each habitat has a different combination of plants.

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:08.150
A different pollen signature, if you like,

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:11.150
or a different pollen fingerprint.

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:15.150
By looking at the proportions and combinations

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:18.150
of different kinds of pollen in a sample,

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:21.150
you can tell very precisely where it came from.

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:24.150
This is some pollen embedded in a cotton shirt,

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:27.150
similar to the one that I'm wearing now.

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:29.150
Now, much of the pollen will still be there

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:31.150
after repeated washings.

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:34.150
Where has it been?

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:36.150
Four very different habitats might look similar,

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:39.150
but they've got very different pollen signatures.

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:41.150
Actually this one is particularly easy, these pictures were all taken

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:43.150
in different countries.

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:45.150
But pollen forensics can be very subtle.

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:47.150
It's being used now to track

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:49.150
where counterfeit drugs have been made,

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:52.150
where banknotes have come from,

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:54.150
to look at the provenance of antiques

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:56.150
and see that they really did come from the place

00:05:56.150 --> 00:05:59.150
the seller said they did.

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:01.150
And murder suspects have been tracked

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:03.150
using their clothing,

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:06.150
certainly in the U.K., to within an area

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:08.150
that's small enough that you can send in tracker dogs

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:10.150
to find the murder victim.

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:12.150
So, you can tell from a piece of clothing

00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:16.150
to within about a kilometer or so,

00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:18.150
where that piece of clothing has been recently

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:21.150
and then send in dogs.

00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:24.150
And finally, in a rather grizzly way,

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:26.150
the Bosnia war crimes;

00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:29.150
some of the people brought to trial were brought to trial

00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:31.150
because of the evidence from pollen,

00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:33.150
which showed that bodies had been buried,

00:06:33.150 --> 00:06:38.150
exhumed and then reburied somewhere else.

00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:40.150
I hope I've opened your eyes,

00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:42.150
if you'll excuse the visual pun, (Laughter)

00:06:42.150 --> 00:06:44.150
to some of pollen's secrets.

00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:46.150
This is a horse chestnut.

00:06:46.150 --> 00:06:48.150
There is an invisible beauty all around us,

00:06:48.150 --> 00:06:50.150
each grain with a story to tell ...

00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:52.150
each of us, in fact, with a story to tell

00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:55.150
from the pollen fingerprint that's upon us.

00:06:55.150 --> 00:06:57.150
Thank you to the colleagues at Kew,

00:06:57.150 --> 00:06:59.150
and thank you to palynologists everywhere.

00:06:59.150 --> 00:07:03.150
(Applause)
