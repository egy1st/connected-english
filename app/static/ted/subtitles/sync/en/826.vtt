00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:14.150
In my industry,

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:17.150
we believe that images can change the world.

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:20.150
Okay, we're naive, we're bright-eyed and bushy-tailed.

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:22.150
The truth is that we know that the

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:24.150
images themselves don't change the world,

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.150
but we're also aware that, since the beginning of photography,

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.150
images have provoked reactions in people,

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:33.150
and those reactions have caused change to happen.

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:36.150
So let's begin with a group of images.

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:38.150
I'd be extremely surprised

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:41.150
if you didn't recognize many or most of them.

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:43.150
They're best described as iconic:

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:46.150
so iconic, perhaps, they're cliches.

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:48.150
In fact, they're so well-known

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:50.150
that you might even recognize them

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:53.150
in a slightly or somewhat different form.

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:56.150
(Laughter)

00:00:57.150 --> 00:00:59.150
But I think we're looking for something more.

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:01.150
We're looking for something more.

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:03.150
We're looking for images that shine

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:06.150
an uncompromising light on crucial issues,

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.150
images that transcend borders, that transcend religions,

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.150
images that provoke us

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:13.150
to step up and do something --

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:15.150
in other words, to act.

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:18.150
Well, this image you've all seen.

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.150
It changed our view of the physical world.

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:23.150
We had never seen our planet from this perspective before.

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:25.150
Many people credit

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:27.150
a lot of the birth of the environmental movement

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.150
to our seeing the planet like this

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:31.150
for the first time --

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:33.150
its smallness, its fragility.

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:37.150
Forty years later, this group, more than most,

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:39.150
are well aware of the destructive power

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:42.150
that our species can wield over our environment.

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:45.150
And at last, we appear to be doing something about it.

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:49.150
This destructive power takes many different forms.

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:52.150
For example, these images taken by Brent Stirton

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:54.150
in the Congo.

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:57.150
These gorillas were murdered, some would even say crucified,

00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:59.150
and unsurprisingly,

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:01.150
they sparked international outrage.

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:03.150
Most recently,

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:06.150
we've been tragically reminded of the destructive power of nature itself

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:08.150
with the recent earthquake in Haiti.

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:12.150
Well, I think what is far worse

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:14.150
is man's destructive power over man.

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:17.150
Samuel Pisar, an Auschwitz survivor, said,

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:19.150
and I'll quote him,

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:21.150
"The Holocaust teaches us that nature,

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:24.150
even in its cruelest moments,

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:27.150
is benign in comparison with man,

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:30.150
when he loses his moral compass and his reason."

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:33.150
There's another kind of crucifixion.

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:35.150
The horrifying images from Abu Ghraib

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:37.150
as well as the images from Guantanamo

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:39.150
had a profound impact.

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:41.150
The publication of those images,

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:43.150
as opposed to the images themselves,

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:46.150
caused a government to change its policies.

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:48.150
Some would argue that it is those images

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:51.150
that did more to fuel the insurgency in Iraq

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:53.150
than virtually any other single act.

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:56.150
Furthermore, those images forever removed

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:59.150
the so-called moral high ground of the occupying forces.

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:01.150
Let's go back a little.

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:03.150
In the 1960s and 1970s,

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:05.150
the Vietnam War was basically shown

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:07.150
in America's living rooms day in, day out.

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:10.150
News photos brought people face to face

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:13.150
with the victims of the war: a little girl burned by napalm,

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:16.150
a student killed by the National Guard

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:19.150
at Kent State University in Ohio during a protest.

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:21.150
In fact, these images became

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:23.150
the voices of protest themselves.

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:25.150
Now, images have power

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:27.150
to shed light of understanding

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:29.150
on suspicion, ignorance,

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:31.150
and in particular -- I've given a lot of talks on this

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:34.150
but I'll just show one image --

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:36.150
the issue of HIV/AIDS.

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:40.150
In the 1980s, the stigmatization of people with the disease

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:42.150
was an enormous barrier

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:44.150
to even discussing or addressing it.

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:47.150
A simple act, in 1987, of the most famous woman in the world,

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:49.150
the Princess of Wales, touching

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:51.150
an HIV/AIDS infected baby

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:54.150
did a great deal, especially in Europe, to stop that.

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:57.150
She, better than most, knew the power of an image.

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:00.150
So when we are confronted by a powerful image,

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:02.150
we all have a choice:

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:05.150
We can look away, or we can address the image.

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:07.150
Thankfully, when these photos appeared in

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:09.150
The Guardian in 1998,

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:12.150
they put a lot of focus and attention and, in the end, a lot of money

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:14.150
towards the Sudan famine relief efforts.

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:16.150
Did the images change the world?

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:18.150
No, but they had a major impact.

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:21.150
Images often push us to question our core beliefs

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:24.150
and our responsibilities to each other.

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:26.150
We all saw those images after Katrina,

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:28.150
and I think for millions of people

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:30.150
they had a very strong impact.

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:32.150
And I think it's very unlikely

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:34.150
that they were far from the minds of Americans

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:37.150
when they went to vote in November 2008.

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:41.150
Unfortunately, some very important images

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:44.150
are deemed too graphic or disturbing for us to see them.

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:47.150
I'll show you one photo here,

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:50.150
and it's a photo by Eugene Richards of an Iraq War veteran

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:52.150
from an extraordinary piece of work,

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:55.150
which has never been published, called War Is Personal.

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:57.150
But images don't need to be graphic

00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:59.150
in order to remind us of the tragedy of war.

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:02.150
John Moore set up this photo at Arlington Cemetery.

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:04.150
After all the tense moments of conflict

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:07.150
in all the conflict zones of the world,

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:10.150
there's one photograph from a much quieter place

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:13.150
that haunts me still, much more than the others.

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:17.150
Ansel Adams said, and I'm going to disagree with him,

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:20.150
"You don't take a photograph, you make it."

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:22.150
In my view, it's not the photographer who makes the photo,

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:24.150
it's you.

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:26.150
We bring to each image

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:28.150
our own values, our own belief systems,

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:31.150
and as a result of that, the image resonates with us.

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:33.150
My company has 70 million images.

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:36.150
I have one image in my office.

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:38.150
Here it is.

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:40.150
I hope that the next time you see

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:42.150
an image that sparks something in you,

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:44.150
you'll better understand why,

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:47.150
and I know that speaking to this audience,

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:49.150
you'll definitely do something about it.

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:51.150
And thank you to all the photographers.

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:53.150
(Applause)
