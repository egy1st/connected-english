WEBVTT

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:15.150
Good morning.

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:18.150
Happy to see so many fine folks out here

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:20.150
and so many smiling faces.

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.150
I have a very peculiar

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:25.150
background, attitude and approach

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:27.150
to the real world

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.150
because I am a conjurer.

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:32.150
Now, I prefer that term over magician,

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:34.150
because if I were a magician, that would mean

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:36.150
that I use spells and incantations

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:39.150
and weird gestures

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:42.150
in order to accomplish real magic.

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:44.150
No, I don't do that; I'm a conjurer,

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:47.150
who is someone who pretends to be

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:50.150
a real magician. (Laughter)

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:53.150
Now, how do we go about that sort of thing?

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:55.150
We depend on the fact

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:57.150
that audiences, such as yourselves,

00:00:57.150 --> 00:00:59.150
will make assumptions.

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:01.150
For example, when I walked up here

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:03.150
and I took the microphone from the stand

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:05.150
and switched it on,

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:07.150
you assumed this was a microphone, which it is not.

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:09.150
(Laughter)

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.150
As a matter of fact, this is something

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:14.150
that about half of you, more than half of you will not be familiar with.

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:17.150
It's a beard trimmer, you see?

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:19.150
And it makes a very bad microphone;

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:21.150
I've tried it many times. (Laughter)

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.150
The other assumption that you made --

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:25.150
and this little lesson is to show you

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:27.150
that you will make assumptions.

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.150
Not only that you can, but that you will

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:31.150
when they are properly suggested to you.

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:33.150
You believe I'm looking at you.

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:36.150
Wrong. I'm not looking at you. I can't see you.

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:39.150
I know you're out there, they told me backstage, it's a full house and such.

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.150
I know you're there because I can hear you,

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:44.150
but I can't see you because I normally wear glasses.

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:46.150
These are not glasses, these are empty frames. (Laughter)

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:48.150
Quite empty frames.

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:51.150
Now why would a grown man appear before you

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:53.150
wearing empty frames on his face?

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:55.150
To fool you, ladies and gentlemen,

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:58.150
to deceive you, to show that you, too,

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:00.150
can make assumptions.

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:02.150
Don't you ever forget that.

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:04.150
Now, I have to do something -- first of all, switch to real glasses

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:06.150
so I can actually see you,

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:09.150
which would probably be a convenience. I don't know.

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:11.150
I haven't had a good look. Well, it's not that great a convenience.

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:13.150
(Laughter)

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:15.150
I have to do something now, which seems

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:17.150
a little bit strange for a magician.

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:19.150
But I'm going to take some medication.

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:21.150
This is a full bottle of

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:23.150
Calms Forte.

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:25.150
I'll explain that in just a moment.

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:27.150
Ignore the instructions,

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:29.150
that's what the government has to put in there

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:32.150
to confuse you, I'm sure.

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:34.150
I will take enough of these. Mm.

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:37.150
Indeed, the whole container.

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:47.150
Thirty-two tablets of Calms Forte.

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:50.150
Now that I've done that -- I'll explain it in a moment --

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:52.150
I must tell you that

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:54.150
I am an actor.

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:57.150
I'm an actor who plays a specific part.

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:59.150
I play the part of a magician,

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:02.150
a wizard, if you will, a real wizard.

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:05.150
If someone were to appear on this stage in front of me

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:07.150
and actually claim to be

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:10.150
an ancient prince of Denmark named Hamlet,

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:12.150
you would be insulted

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:14.150
and rightly so.

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:16.150
Why would a man assume that you would believe

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:18.150
something bizarre like this?

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:20.150
But there exists out there

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:23.150
a very large population

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:25.150
of people who will tell you

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:27.150
that they have psychic, magical powers

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:29.150
that they can predict the future,

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:31.150
that they can make contact with the deceased.

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:33.150
Oh, they also say

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:35.150
they will sell you astrology

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:37.150
or other fortunetelling methods.

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:39.150
Oh, they gladly sell you that, yes.

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:41.150
And they also say

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:43.150
that they can give you perpetual motion machines

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:45.150
and free energy systems.

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:47.150
They claim to be psychics,

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:49.150
or sensitives, whatever they can.

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:52.150
But the one thing that has made a big comeback

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:54.150
just recently

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:56.150
is this business of

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:58.150
speaking with the dead.

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:01.150
Now, to my innocent mind,

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:04.150
dead implies

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:07.150
incapable of communicating. (Laughter)

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:09.150
You might agree with me on that.

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:12.150
But these people, they tend to tell you that

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:14.150
not only can they communicate with the dead --

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:16.150
"Hi, there" --

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:18.150
but they can hear the dead as well,

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:21.150
and they can relay this information back to the living.

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:23.150
I wonder if that's true.

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:25.150
I don't think so, because

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:27.150
this subculture of people

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:30.150
use exactly the same gimmicks that we magicians do,

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:32.150
exactly the same --

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:35.150
the same physical methods, the same psychological methods --

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:38.150
and they effectively and profoundly

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:40.150
deceive millions of people around the earth,

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:42.150
to their detriment.

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:44.150
They deceive these people,

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:46.150
costs them a lot of money,

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:48.150
cost them a lot of emotional anguish.

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:50.150
Billions of dollars are spent

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:53.150
every year, all over the globe,

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:55.150
on these charlatans.

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:57.150
Now, I have two questions

00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:59.150
I would like to ask these people

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:01.150
if I had the opportunity to do so.

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:04.150
First question: If I want to ask them to call up --

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:06.150
because they do hear them through the ear.

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:08.150
They listen to the spirits like this --

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:11.150
I'm going to ask you to call up the ghost of my grandmother

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:13.150
because, when she died, she had the family will,

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:15.150
and she secreted it someplace. We don't know where it is,

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:18.150
so we ask Granny, "Where is the will, Granny?"

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:21.150
What does Granny say? She says, "I'm in heaven and it's wonderful.

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:23.150
I'm here with all my old friends, my deceased friends,

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:25.150
and my family

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:28.150
and all the puppy dogs and the kittens that I used to have when I was a little girl.

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:31.150
And I love you, and I'll always be with you.

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:33.150
Good bye."

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:35.150
And she didn't answer the damn question!

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:37.150
Where is the will?

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:39.150
Now, she could easily have said,

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:41.150
"Oh, it's in the library on the second shelf, behind the encyclopedia,"

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:44.150
but she doesn't say that. No, she doesn't.

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:47.150
She doesn't bring any useful information to us.

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:49.150
We paid a lot of money for that information,

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:51.150
be we didn't get it.

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:54.150
The second question that I'd like to ask, rather simple:

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:56.150
Suppose I ask them to contact

00:05:56.150 --> 00:05:59.150
the spirit of my deceased father-in-law, as an example.

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:01.150
Why do they insist on saying --

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:03.150
remember, they speak into this ear --

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:07.150
why do they say, "My name starts with J or M?"

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:10.150
Is this a hunting game?

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:12.150
Hunting and fishing? What is it?

00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:15.150
Is it 20 questions? No, it's more like 120 questions.

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:18.150
But it is a cruel, vicious,

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:22.150
absolutely conscienceless --

00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:25.150
I'll be all right, keep your seats (Laughter) --

00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:27.150
game that these people play.

00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:30.150
And they take advantage of the innocent, the naive,

00:06:30.150 --> 00:06:33.150
the grieving, the needy people out there.

00:06:33.150 --> 00:06:35.150
Now, this is a process

00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:38.150
that is called cold reading.

00:06:39.150 --> 00:06:41.150
There's one fellow out there,

00:06:42.150 --> 00:06:44.150
Van Praagh is his name, James Van Praagh.

00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:46.150
He's one of the big practitioners of this sort of thing.

00:06:46.150 --> 00:06:49.150
John Edward, Sylvia Browne

00:06:49.150 --> 00:06:52.150
and Rosemary Altea, they are other operators.

00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:55.150
There are hundreds of them all over the earth, but in this country,

00:06:55.150 --> 00:06:57.150
James Van Praagh is very big.

00:06:57.150 --> 00:06:59.150
And what does he do? He likes to tell you

00:06:59.150 --> 00:07:01.150
how the deceased got deceased,

00:07:01.150 --> 00:07:04.150
the people he's talking to through his ear, you see?

00:07:04.150 --> 00:07:07.150
So what he says is, very often, is like this: he says,

00:07:07.150 --> 00:07:10.150
"He tells me, he tells me, before he passed,

00:07:11.150 --> 00:07:13.150
that he had trouble breathing."

00:07:13.150 --> 00:07:15.150
Folks, that's what dying is all about!

00:07:15.150 --> 00:07:17.150
(Laughter)

00:07:17.150 --> 00:07:19.150
You stop breathing, and then you're dead.

00:07:19.150 --> 00:07:21.150
It's that simple.

00:07:21.150 --> 00:07:24.150
And that's the kind of information they're going to bring back to you?

00:07:24.150 --> 00:07:26.150
I don't think so.

00:07:26.150 --> 00:07:28.150
Now, these people will make guesses, they'll say things like,

00:07:28.150 --> 00:07:30.150
"Why am I getting electricity?

00:07:30.150 --> 00:07:33.150
He's saying to me, 'Electricity.'

00:07:33.150 --> 00:07:35.150
Was he an electrician?" "No."

00:07:35.150 --> 00:07:37.150
"Did he ever have an electric razor?" "No."

00:07:37.150 --> 00:07:39.150
It was a game of hunting questions like this.

00:07:39.150 --> 00:07:41.150
This is what they go through.

00:07:41.150 --> 00:07:43.150
Now, folks often ask us

00:07:43.150 --> 00:07:45.150
at the James Randi Educational Foundation,

00:07:45.150 --> 00:07:48.150
they call me, they say, "Why are you so concerned about this, Mr. Randi?

00:07:48.150 --> 00:07:50.150
Isn't it just a lot of fun?"

00:07:50.150 --> 00:07:53.150
No, it is not fun. It is a cruel farce.

00:07:53.150 --> 00:07:56.150
Now, it may bring a certain amount of comfort,

00:07:56.150 --> 00:07:58.150
but that comfort lasts

00:07:58.150 --> 00:08:00.150
only about 20 minutes or so.

00:08:00.150 --> 00:08:02.150
And then the people look in the mirror, and they say,

00:08:02.150 --> 00:08:04.150
I just paid a lot of money for that reading.

00:08:04.150 --> 00:08:07.150
And what did she say to me? 'I love you!'"

00:08:07.150 --> 00:08:09.150
They always say that.

00:08:09.150 --> 00:08:11.150
They don't get any information,

00:08:11.150 --> 00:08:13.150
they don't get any value for what they spend.

00:08:13.150 --> 00:08:15.150
Now, Sylvia Browne is the big operator.

00:08:15.150 --> 00:08:17.150
We call her "The Talons."

00:08:17.150 --> 00:08:19.150
Sylvia Browne -- thank you --

00:08:19.150 --> 00:08:22.150
Sylvia Browne is the big operator

00:08:22.150 --> 00:08:24.150
in this field at this very moment.

00:08:24.150 --> 00:08:27.150
Now, Sylvia Browne -- just to show you --

00:08:27.150 --> 00:08:30.150
she actually gets 700 dollars

00:08:30.150 --> 00:08:33.150
for a 20 minute reading over the telephone,

00:08:33.150 --> 00:08:35.150
she doesn't even go there in person,

00:08:35.150 --> 00:08:37.150
and you have to wait up to two years because

00:08:37.150 --> 00:08:39.150
she's booked ahead that amount of time.

00:08:39.150 --> 00:08:41.150
You pay by credit card or whatever,

00:08:41.150 --> 00:08:43.150
and then she will call you

00:08:43.150 --> 00:08:45.150
sometime in the next two years.

00:08:45.150 --> 00:08:47.150
You can tell it's her. "Hello, this is Sylvia Browne."

00:08:47.150 --> 00:08:49.150
That's her, you can tell right away.

00:08:51.150 --> 00:08:54.150
Now, Montel Williams is an intelligent man.

00:08:54.150 --> 00:08:57.150
We all know who he is on television.

00:08:57.150 --> 00:08:59.150
He's well educated, he's smart,

00:08:59.150 --> 00:09:01.150
he knows what Sylvia Browne is doing

00:09:01.150 --> 00:09:03.150
but he doesn't give a damn.

00:09:03.150 --> 00:09:06.150
He just doesn't care.

00:09:07.150 --> 00:09:10.150
Because, the bottom line is, the sponsors love it,

00:09:10.150 --> 00:09:12.150
and he will expose her

00:09:12.150 --> 00:09:14.150
to television publicity all the time.

00:09:14.150 --> 00:09:17.150
Now, what does Sylvia Browne give you for that 700 dollars?

00:09:17.150 --> 00:09:20.150
She gives you the names of your guardian angels, that's first.

00:09:20.150 --> 00:09:23.150
Now, without that, how could we possibly function? (Laughter)

00:09:23.150 --> 00:09:26.150
She gives you the names of previous lives,

00:09:26.150 --> 00:09:28.150
who you were in previous lives.

00:09:28.150 --> 00:09:30.150
Duh.

00:09:30.150 --> 00:09:32.150
It turns out that the women

00:09:32.150 --> 00:09:34.150
that she gives readings for

00:09:34.150 --> 00:09:37.150
were all Babylonian princesses, or something like that.

00:09:37.150 --> 00:09:39.150
And the men were all Grecian warriors

00:09:39.150 --> 00:09:42.150
fighting with Agamemnon.

00:09:42.150 --> 00:09:44.150
Nothing is ever said about

00:09:44.150 --> 00:09:46.150
a 14 year-old bootblack in the streets of London

00:09:46.150 --> 00:09:48.150
who died of consumption.

00:09:48.150 --> 00:09:51.150
He isn't worth bringing back, obviously.

00:09:51.150 --> 00:09:54.150
And the strange thing -- folks, you may have noticed this too.

00:09:54.150 --> 00:09:57.150
You see these folks on television --

00:09:57.150 --> 00:10:00.150
they never call anybody back from hell. (Laughter)

00:10:01.150 --> 00:10:04.150
Everyone comes back from heaven, but never from hell.

00:10:04.150 --> 00:10:06.150
If they call back any of my friends,

00:10:06.150 --> 00:10:08.150
they're not going to... Well, you see the story.

00:10:08.150 --> 00:10:10.150
(Laughter)

00:10:11.150 --> 00:10:14.150
Now, Sylvia Browne is an exception,

00:10:14.150 --> 00:10:16.150
an exception in one way,

00:10:16.150 --> 00:10:19.150
because the James Randi Educational Foundation, my foundation,

00:10:19.150 --> 00:10:22.150
offers a one million dollar prize in negotiable bonds.

00:10:22.150 --> 00:10:24.150
Very simply won.

00:10:24.150 --> 00:10:26.150
All you have to do is prove any paranormal, occult

00:10:26.150 --> 00:10:28.150
or supernatural event or power of any kind

00:10:28.150 --> 00:10:30.150
under proper observing conditions.

00:10:30.150 --> 00:10:32.150
It's very easy, win the million dollars.

00:10:32.150 --> 00:10:34.150
Sylvia Browne is an exception in that

00:10:34.150 --> 00:10:37.150
she's the only professional psychic

00:10:37.150 --> 00:10:39.150
in the whole world

00:10:39.150 --> 00:10:42.150
that has accepted our challenge.

00:10:42.150 --> 00:10:45.150
She did this on the "Larry King Live" show on CNN

00:10:45.150 --> 00:10:48.150
six and a half years ago.

00:10:48.150 --> 00:10:51.150
And we haven't heard from her since. Strange.

00:10:51.150 --> 00:10:54.150
She said that, first of all, that she didn't know how to contact me.

00:10:54.150 --> 00:10:56.150
Duh.

00:10:56.150 --> 00:10:58.150
A professional psychic who speaks to dead people,

00:10:59.150 --> 00:11:01.150
she can't reach me?

00:11:01.150 --> 00:11:03.150
(Laughter)

00:11:03.150 --> 00:11:05.150
I'm alive, you may have noticed.

00:11:05.150 --> 00:11:07.150
Well, pretty well anyway.

00:11:08.150 --> 00:11:11.150
She couldn't reach me. Now she says she doesn't want to reach me

00:11:11.150 --> 00:11:14.150
because I'm a godless person.

00:11:14.150 --> 00:11:16.150
All the more reason to take the million dollars,

00:11:16.150 --> 00:11:18.150
wouldn't you think, Sylvia?

00:11:18.150 --> 00:11:21.150
Now these people need to be stopped, seriously now.

00:11:21.150 --> 00:11:23.150
They need to be stopped because this is a cruel farce.

00:11:23.150 --> 00:11:26.150
We get people coming to the foundation all the time.

00:11:26.150 --> 00:11:29.150
They're ruined financially and emotionally

00:11:29.150 --> 00:11:31.150
because they've given their money and their faith

00:11:31.150 --> 00:11:33.150
to these people.

00:11:33.150 --> 00:11:35.150
Now, I popped some pills earlier.

00:11:35.150 --> 00:11:37.150
I have to explain that to you.

00:11:37.150 --> 00:11:40.150
Homeopathy, let's find out what that's all about.

00:11:40.150 --> 00:11:42.150
Hmm. You've heard of it.

00:11:42.150 --> 00:11:45.150
It's an alternative form of healing, right?

00:11:45.150 --> 00:11:48.150
Homeopathy actually consists -- and that's what this is.

00:11:48.150 --> 00:11:51.150
This is Calms Forte,

00:11:51.150 --> 00:11:54.150
32 caplets of sleeping pills! I forgot to tell you that.

00:11:54.150 --> 00:11:56.150
I just ingested

00:11:56.150 --> 00:11:59.150
six and a half days worth of sleeping pills.

00:11:59.150 --> 00:12:01.150
(Laughter)

00:12:01.150 --> 00:12:03.150
Six and a half days, that certainly is a fatal dose.

00:12:03.150 --> 00:12:05.150
It says right on the back here,

00:12:05.150 --> 00:12:07.150
"In case of overdose,

00:12:07.150 --> 00:12:09.150
contact your poison control center immediately,"

00:12:09.150 --> 00:12:11.150
and it gives an 800 number.

00:12:11.150 --> 00:12:13.150
Keep your seats -- it's going to be okay.

00:12:13.150 --> 00:12:15.150
I don't really need it

00:12:15.150 --> 00:12:17.150
because I've been doing this stunt

00:12:17.150 --> 00:12:20.150
for audiences all over the world

00:12:20.150 --> 00:12:22.150
for the last eight or 10 years,

00:12:22.150 --> 00:12:25.150
taking fatal doses of homeopathic sleeping pills.

00:12:25.150 --> 00:12:27.150
Why don't they affect me?

00:12:27.150 --> 00:12:29.150
(Laughter)

00:12:29.150 --> 00:12:32.150
(Applause)

00:12:32.150 --> 00:12:34.150
The answer may surprise you.

00:12:34.150 --> 00:12:36.150
What is homeopathy?

00:12:36.150 --> 00:12:38.150
It's taking a medicine that really works

00:12:38.150 --> 00:12:40.150
and diluting it down

00:12:40.150 --> 00:12:42.150
well beyond Avogadro's limit.

00:12:42.150 --> 00:12:44.150
Diluting it down to the point

00:12:44.150 --> 00:12:47.150
where there's none of it left. (Laughter)

00:12:47.150 --> 00:12:49.150
Now folks, this is not

00:12:49.150 --> 00:12:52.150
just a metaphor I'm going to give you now, it's true.

00:12:52.150 --> 00:12:54.150
It's exactly equivalent to taking

00:12:54.150 --> 00:12:58.150
one 325 milligram aspirin tablet,

00:12:58.150 --> 00:13:01.150
throwing it into the middle of Lake Tahoe,

00:13:01.150 --> 00:13:04.150
and then stirring it up, obviously with a very big stick,

00:13:04.150 --> 00:13:06.150
and waiting two years or so

00:13:06.150 --> 00:13:09.150
until the solution is homogeneous.

00:13:09.150 --> 00:13:11.150
Then, when you get a headache,

00:13:11.150 --> 00:13:14.150
you take a sip of this water, and -- voila! -- it is gone.

00:13:14.150 --> 00:13:16.150
(Laughter)

00:13:16.150 --> 00:13:19.150
Now that is true. That is what homeopathy is all about.

00:13:19.150 --> 00:13:22.150
And another claim that they make -- you'll love this one --

00:13:22.150 --> 00:13:25.150
the more dilute the medicine is, they say,

00:13:25.150 --> 00:13:27.150
the more powerful it is.

00:13:27.150 --> 00:13:30.150
Now wait a minute, we heard about a guy in Florida.

00:13:30.150 --> 00:13:32.150
The poor man, he was on homeopathic medicine.

00:13:32.150 --> 00:13:34.150
He died of an overdose.

00:13:34.150 --> 00:13:36.150
He forgot to take his pill.

00:13:36.150 --> 00:13:38.150
(Laughter)

00:13:38.150 --> 00:13:40.150
Work on it. Work on it.

00:13:42.150 --> 00:13:45.150
It's a ridiculous thing. It is absolutely ridiculous.

00:13:45.150 --> 00:13:47.150
I don't know what we're doing,

00:13:47.150 --> 00:13:50.150
believing in all this nonsense over all these years.

00:13:50.150 --> 00:13:52.150
Now, let me tell you,

00:13:52.150 --> 00:13:54.150
The James Randi Educational Foundation

00:13:54.150 --> 00:13:56.150
is waving this very big carrot,

00:13:56.150 --> 00:13:59.150
but I must say, the fact that nobody

00:13:59.150 --> 00:14:01.150
has taken us up on this offer

00:14:01.150 --> 00:14:03.150
doesn't mean that the powers don't exist.

00:14:03.150 --> 00:14:06.150
They might, some place out there.

00:14:06.150 --> 00:14:09.150
Maybe these people are just independently wealthy.

00:14:09.150 --> 00:14:11.150
Well, with Sylvia Browne I would think so.

00:14:11.150 --> 00:14:13.150
You know, 700 dollars for a 20 minute reading

00:14:13.150 --> 00:14:15.150
over the telephone --

00:14:15.150 --> 00:14:17.150
that's more than lawyers make!

00:14:18.150 --> 00:14:20.150
I mean that's a fabulous amount of money.

00:14:20.150 --> 00:14:23.150
These people don't need the million dollars perhaps,

00:14:23.150 --> 00:14:25.150
but wouldn't you think they'd like to take it

00:14:25.150 --> 00:14:27.150
just to make me look silly?

00:14:27.150 --> 00:14:30.150
Just to get rid of this godless person out there

00:14:30.150 --> 00:14:33.150
that Sylvia Browne talks about all the time?

00:14:33.150 --> 00:14:35.150
I think that something needs to be done about this.

00:14:35.150 --> 00:14:38.150
We really would love to have suggestions from you folks

00:14:38.150 --> 00:14:41.150
on how to contact federal, state

00:14:41.150 --> 00:14:43.150
and local authorities

00:14:43.150 --> 00:14:45.150
to get them to do something.

00:14:45.150 --> 00:14:48.150
If you find out -- now I understand.

00:14:48.150 --> 00:14:50.150
We've seen people, even today, speaking to us

00:14:50.150 --> 00:14:52.150
about AIDS epidemics

00:14:52.150 --> 00:14:54.150
and starving kids around the world

00:14:54.150 --> 00:14:57.150
and impure water supplies that people have to suffer with.

00:14:57.150 --> 00:14:59.150
Those are very important,

00:14:59.150 --> 00:15:01.150
critically important to us.

00:15:01.150 --> 00:15:04.150
And we must do something about those problems.

00:15:04.150 --> 00:15:06.150
But at the same time,

00:15:06.150 --> 00:15:08.150
as Arthur C. Clarke said,

00:15:08.150 --> 00:15:10.150
The rotting of the human mind,

00:15:10.150 --> 00:15:12.150
the business of believing in the paranormal and the occult

00:15:12.150 --> 00:15:14.150
and the supernatural --

00:15:14.150 --> 00:15:16.150
all of this total nonsense,

00:15:16.150 --> 00:15:18.150
this medieval thinking --

00:15:18.150 --> 00:15:20.150
I think something should be done about that,

00:15:20.150 --> 00:15:22.150
and it all lies in education.

00:15:22.150 --> 00:15:24.150
Largely, it's the media

00:15:24.150 --> 00:15:26.150
who are to blame for this sort of thing.

00:15:26.150 --> 00:15:28.150
They shamelessly promote

00:15:28.150 --> 00:15:30.150
all kinds of nonsense of this sort

00:15:30.150 --> 00:15:33.150
because it pleases the sponsors.

00:15:34.150 --> 00:15:36.150
It's the bottom line, the dollar line.

00:15:36.150 --> 00:15:38.150
That's what they're looking at.

00:15:38.150 --> 00:15:40.150
We really must do something about this.

00:15:40.150 --> 00:15:42.150
I'm willing to take your suggestions,

00:15:42.150 --> 00:15:44.150
and I'm willing to have you

00:15:44.150 --> 00:15:47.150
tune in to our webpage.

00:15:47.150 --> 00:15:50.150
It's www.randi.org.

00:15:50.150 --> 00:15:52.150
Go in there and look at the archives,

00:15:52.150 --> 00:15:54.150
and you will begin to understand much more

00:15:54.150 --> 00:15:56.150
of what I've been talking about today.

00:15:56.150 --> 00:15:58.150
You will see the records that we have.

00:15:58.150 --> 00:16:00.150
There's nothing like sitting in that library

00:16:00.150 --> 00:16:02.150
and having a family appear there

00:16:02.150 --> 00:16:05.150
and say that Mum gave away all the family fortune.

00:16:05.150 --> 00:16:07.150
She cashed in the CDs,

00:16:07.150 --> 00:16:10.150
she gave away the stocks and the certificates.

00:16:10.150 --> 00:16:12.150
That's really sad to hear,

00:16:12.150 --> 00:16:15.150
and it hasn't helped them one bit,

00:16:15.150 --> 00:16:17.150
hasn't solved any of their problems.

00:16:17.150 --> 00:16:19.150
Yes, there could be a rotting of the American mind,

00:16:19.150 --> 00:16:22.150
and of the minds all the way around the earth,

00:16:22.150 --> 00:16:25.150
if we don't start to think sensibly about these things.

00:16:26.150 --> 00:16:28.150
Now, we've offered this carrot,

00:16:28.150 --> 00:16:30.150
as I say, we've dangled the carrot.

00:16:30.150 --> 00:16:32.150
We're waiting for the psychics to come forth and snap at it.

00:16:32.150 --> 00:16:34.150
Oh, we get lots of them,

00:16:34.150 --> 00:16:36.150
hundreds of them every year come by.

00:16:36.150 --> 00:16:38.150
These are dowsers and people

00:16:38.150 --> 00:16:40.150
who think that they can talk to the dead as well,

00:16:40.150 --> 00:16:42.150
but they're amateurs; they don't know how to evaluate

00:16:42.150 --> 00:16:45.150
their own so-called powers.

00:16:45.150 --> 00:16:47.150
The professionals never come near us,

00:16:47.150 --> 00:16:49.150
except in that case of Sylvia Browne

00:16:49.150 --> 00:16:51.150
that I told you about a moment ago.

00:16:52.150 --> 00:16:55.150
She did accept and then backed away.

00:16:55.150 --> 00:16:58.150
Ladies and gentlemen,

00:16:58.150 --> 00:17:01.150
I'm James Randi,

00:17:01.150 --> 00:17:04.150
and I'm waiting.

00:17:04.150 --> 00:17:06.150
Thank you.

00:17:06.150 --> 00:17:09.150
(Applause)
