00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.150
I've been playing TED for nearly a decade,

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.150
and I've very rarely played

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.150
any new songs of my own.

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.150
And that was largely because there weren't any.

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.150
(Laughter)

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:34.150
So I've been busy with a couple of projects,

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:36.150
and one of them was this:

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:38.150
The Nutmeg.

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:40.150
A 1930s ship's lifeboat,

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:42.150
which I've been restoring in the garden

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:44.150
of my beach house in England.

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:46.150
And, so now,

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:49.150
when the polar ice caps melt,

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:52.150
my recording studio will rise up like an ark,

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:55.150
and I'll float off into the drowned world

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:58.150
like a character from a J.G. Ballard novel.

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:00.150
During the day,

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:02.150
the Nutmeg collects energy

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:05.150
from solar panels on the roof of the wheelhouse,

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:07.150
and from a 450 watt turbine

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:09.150
up the mast.

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.150
So that when it gets dark,

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:13.150
I've got plenty of power.

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:16.150
And I can light up the Nutmeg like a beacon.

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:19.150
And so I go in there until the early hours of the morning,

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:22.150
and I work on new songs.

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:24.150
I'd like to play to you guys,

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.150
if you're willing to be the first audience to hear it.

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:30.150
(Applause)

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:34.150
It's about Billie Holiday.

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:36.150
And it appears that,

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:39.150
some night in 1947

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:42.150
she left her physical space

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.150
and was missing all night,

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:47.150
until she reappeared in the morning.

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:49.150
But I know where she was.

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:52.150
She was with me on my lifeboat.

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:54.150
And she was hot.

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:07.150
(Music)

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:26.150
♫ Billie crept softly ♫

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:29.150
♫ into my waking arms ♫

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:34.150
♫ warm like a sip of sour mash ♫

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:39.150
♫ Strange fruit for ♫

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:43.150
♫ a sweet hunk of trash ♫

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:51.150
♫ Panic at the stage door ♫

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:54.150
♫ of Carnegie Hall ♫

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:58.150
♫ "Famous Jazz Singer Gone AWOL" ♫

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:05.150
♫ Must have left the building ♫

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:09.150
♫ body and soul ♫

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:16.150
♫ On a creaky ♫

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:19.150
♫ piano stool tonight ♫

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:21.150
♫ as the moon is my ♫

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:24.150
♫ only witness ♫

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:29.150
♫ She was breathing ♫

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:32.150
♫ in my ear ♫

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:35.150
♫ "This time it's love" ♫

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:42.150
♫ But love is a loaded pistol ♫

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:46.150
♫ By daybreak she's gone ♫

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:50.150
♫ Over the frozen river, home ♫

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:56.150
♫ Me and Johnny Walker ♫

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:59.150
♫ See in the new age ♫

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:01.150
♫ alone ♫

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:08.150
♫ Stay with me ♫

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:11.150
♫ again tonight ♫

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:13.150
♫ Billie, time, ♫

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:16.150
♫ time is a wily trickster ♫

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:21.150
♫ Still an echo ♫

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:24.150
♫ in my heart says, ♫

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:27.150
♫ "This time it's love" ♫

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:45.150
(Applause)
