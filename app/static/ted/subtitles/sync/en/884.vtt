WEBVTT

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:16.150
So since I was here last in '06,

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:18.150
we discovered that global climate change

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:20.150
is turning out to be a pretty serious issue,

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:22.150
so we covered that fairly extensively

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:24.150
in Skeptic magazine.

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.150
We investigate all kinds

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:29.150
of scientific and quasi-scientific controversies,

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:31.150
but it turns out we don't have to worry about any of this

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:33.150
because the world's going to end in 2012.

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:35.150
Another update:

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:37.150
You will recall I introduced you guys

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:39.150
to the Quadro Tracker.

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:41.150
It's like a water dowsing device.

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:44.150
It's just a hollow piece of plastic with an antenna that swivels around.

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:46.150
And you walk around, and it points to things.

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:49.150
Like if you're looking for marijuana in students' lockers,

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:51.150
it'll point right to somebody.

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:53.150
Oh, sorry. (Laughter)

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:55.150
This particular one that was given to me

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:57.150
finds golf balls,

00:00:57.150 --> 00:00:59.150
especially if you're at a golf course

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:02.150
and you check under enough bushes.

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:05.150
Well, under the category of "What's the harm of silly stuff like this?"

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:08.150
this device, the ADE 651,

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:11.150
was sold to the Iraqi government

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:13.150
for 40,000 dollars apiece.

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:15.150
It's just like this one, completely worthless,

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.150
in which it allegedly worked by "electrostatic

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:20.150
magnetic ion attraction,"

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.150
which translates to

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:26.150
"pseudoscientific baloney" -- would be the nice word --

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:28.150
in which you string together a bunch of words that sound good,

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:30.150
but it does absolutely nothing.

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.150
In this case, at trespass points,

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.150
allowing people to go through

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:38.150
because your little tracker device said they were okay,

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:41.150
actually cost lives.

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:43.150
So there is a danger to pseudoscience,

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:46.150
in believing in this sort of thing.

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:49.150
So what I want to talk about today is belief.

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:51.150
I want to believe,

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:53.150
and you do too.

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:55.150
And in fact, I think my thesis here is that

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:57.150
belief is the natural state of things.

00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:59.150
It is the default option. We just believe.

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:01.150
We believe all sorts of things.

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:03.150
Belief is natural;

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:05.150
disbelief, skepticism, science, is not natural.

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:07.150
It's more difficult.

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:09.150
It's uncomfortable to not believe things.

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:12.150
So like Fox Mulder on "X-Files,"

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:15.150
who wants to believe in UFOs? Well, we all do,

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:17.150
and the reason for that is because

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:20.150
we have a belief engine in our brains.

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:23.150
Essentially, we are pattern-seeking primates.

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:26.150
We connect the dots: A is connected to B; B is connected to C.

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:29.150
And sometimes A really is connected to B,

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:31.150
and that's called association learning.

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:34.150
We find patterns, we make those connections,

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:36.150
whether it's Pavlov's dog here

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:39.150
associating the sound of the bell with the food,

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:41.150
and then he salivates to the sound of the bell,

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:43.150
or whether it's a Skinnerian rat,

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:45.150
in which he's having an association

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:47.150
between his behavior and a reward for it,

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:49.150
and therefore he repeats the behavior.

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:51.150
In fact, what Skinner discovered

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:54.150
is that, if you put a pigeon in a box like this,

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:56.150
and he has to press one of these two keys,

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:58.150
and he tries to figure out what the pattern is,

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:00.150
and you give him a little reward in the hopper box there --

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:03.150
if you just randomly assign rewards

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:05.150
such that there is no pattern,

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:07.150
they will figure out any kind of pattern.

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:09.150
And whatever they were doing just before they got the reward,

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:11.150
they repeat that particular pattern.

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:14.150
Sometimes it was even spinning around twice counterclockwise,

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:17.150
once clockwise and peck the key twice.

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:19.150
And that's called superstition,

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:21.150
and that, I'm afraid,

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:23.150
we will always have with us.

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:25.150
I call this process "patternicity" --

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:27.150
that is, the tendency to find meaningful patterns

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:30.150
in both meaningful and meaningless noise.

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:33.150
When we do this process, we make two types of errors.

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:35.150
A Type I error, or false positive,

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:37.150
is believing a pattern is real

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:39.150
when it's not.

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:41.150
Our second type of error is a false negative.

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:43.150
A Type II error is not believing

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:46.150
a pattern is real when it is.

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:48.150
So let's do a thought experiment.

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:50.150
You are a hominid three million years ago

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:53.150
walking on the plains of Africa.

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:55.150
Your name is Lucy, okay?

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:57.150
And you hear a rustle in the grass.

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:59.150
Is it a dangerous predator,

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:01.150
or is it just the wind?

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:04.150
Your next decision could be the most important one of your life.

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:07.150
Well, if you think that the rustle in the grass is a dangerous predator

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:09.150
and it turns out it's just the wind,

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:11.150
you've made an error in cognition,

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:13.150
made a Type I error, false positive.

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:15.150
But no harm. You just move away.

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:17.150
You're more cautious. You're more vigilant.

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:19.150
On the other hand, if you believe that the rustle in the grass is just the wind,

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:22.150
and it turns out it's a dangerous predator,

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:24.150
you're lunch.

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:26.150
You've just won a Darwin award.

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:28.150
You've been taken out of the gene pool.

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:30.150
Now the problem here is that

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:32.150
patternicities will occur whenever the cost

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:34.150
of making a Type I error

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:36.150
is less than the cost of making a Type II error.

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:38.150
This is the only equation in the talk by the way.

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:40.150
We have a pattern detection problem

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:43.150
that is assessing the difference between a Type I and a Type II error

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:45.150
is highly problematic,

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:48.150
especially in split-second, life-and-death situations.

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:50.150
So the default position

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:52.150
is just: Believe all patterns are real --

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:55.150
All rustles in the grass are dangerous predators

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:57.150
and not just the wind.

00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:59.150
And so I think that we evolved ...

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:02.150
there was a natural selection for the propensity for our belief engines,

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:04.150
our pattern-seeking brain processes,

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:06.150
to always find meaningful patterns

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:08.150
and infuse them with these sort of

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:11.150
predatory or intentional agencies that I'll come back to.

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:13.150
So for example, what do you see here?

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:15.150
It's a horse head, that's right.

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:17.150
It looks like a horse. It must be a horse.

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:19.150
That's a pattern.

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:21.150
And is it really a horse?

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:24.150
Or is it more like a frog?

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:26.150
See, our pattern detection device,

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:29.150
which appears to be located in the anterior cingulate cortex --

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:32.150
it's our little detection device there --

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:34.150
can be easily fooled, and this is the problem.

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:36.150
For example, what do you see here?

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:39.150
Yes, of course, it's a cow.

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:42.150
Once I prime the brain -- it's called cognitive priming --

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:44.150
once I prime the brain to see it,

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:47.150
it pops back out again even without the pattern that I've imposed on it.

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:49.150
And what do you see here?

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:51.150
Some people see a Dalmatian dog.

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:53.150
Yes, there it is. And there's the prime.

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:55.150
So when I go back without the prime,

00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:57.150
your brain already has the model

00:05:57.150 --> 00:05:59.150
so you can see it again.

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:02.150
What do you see here?

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:04.150
Planet Saturn. Yes, that's good.

00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:07.150
How about here?

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:10.150
Just shout out anything you see.

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:13.150
That's a good audience, Chris.

00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:16.150
Because there's nothing in this. Well, allegedly there's nothing.

00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:19.150
This is an experiment done by Jennifer Whitson

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:21.150
at U.T. Austin

00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:23.150
on corporate environments

00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:26.150
and whether feelings of uncertainty and out of control

00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:28.150
makes people see illusory patterns.

00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:31.150
That is, almost everybody sees the planet Saturn.

00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:34.150
People that are put in a condition of feeling out of control

00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:36.150
are more likely to see something in this,

00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:39.150
which is allegedly patternless.

00:06:39.150 --> 00:06:42.150
In other words, the propensity to find these patterns

00:06:42.150 --> 00:06:45.150
goes up when there's a lack of control.

00:06:45.150 --> 00:06:48.150
For example, baseball players are notoriously superstitious

00:06:48.150 --> 00:06:50.150
when they're batting,

00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:52.150
but not so much when they're fielding.

00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:54.150
Because fielders are successful

00:06:54.150 --> 00:06:56.150
90 to 95 percent of the time.

00:06:56.150 --> 00:06:59.150
The best batters fail seven out of 10 times.

00:06:59.150 --> 00:07:01.150
So their superstitions, their patternicities,

00:07:01.150 --> 00:07:04.150
are all associated with feelings of lack of control

00:07:04.150 --> 00:07:06.150
and so forth.

00:07:07.150 --> 00:07:10.150
What do you see in this particular one here, in this field?

00:07:10.150 --> 00:07:12.150
Anybody see an object there?

00:07:12.150 --> 00:07:14.150
There actually is something here,

00:07:14.150 --> 00:07:16.150
but it's degraded.

00:07:16.150 --> 00:07:18.150
While you're thinking about that,

00:07:18.150 --> 00:07:20.150
this was an experiment done by Susan Blackmore,

00:07:20.150 --> 00:07:22.150
a psychologist in England,

00:07:22.150 --> 00:07:24.150
who showed subjects this degraded image

00:07:24.150 --> 00:07:26.150
and then ran a correlation between

00:07:26.150 --> 00:07:28.150
their scores on an ESP test:

00:07:28.150 --> 00:07:30.150
How much did they believe in the paranormal,

00:07:30.150 --> 00:07:33.150
supernatural, angels and so forth.

00:07:33.150 --> 00:07:36.150
And those who scored high on the ESP scale,

00:07:36.150 --> 00:07:38.150
tended to not only see

00:07:38.150 --> 00:07:40.150
more patterns in the degraded images

00:07:40.150 --> 00:07:42.150
but incorrect patterns.

00:07:42.150 --> 00:07:44.150
Here is what you show subjects.

00:07:44.150 --> 00:07:47.150
The fish is degraded 20 percent, 50 percent

00:07:47.150 --> 00:07:49.150
and then the one I showed you,

00:07:49.150 --> 00:07:51.150
70 percent.

00:07:51.150 --> 00:07:53.150
A similar experiment was done by another [Swiss] psychologist

00:07:53.150 --> 00:07:55.150
named Peter Brugger,

00:07:55.150 --> 00:07:58.150
who found significantly more meaningful patterns

00:07:58.150 --> 00:08:00.150
were perceived on the right hemisphere,

00:08:00.150 --> 00:08:03.150
via the left visual field, than the left hemisphere.

00:08:03.150 --> 00:08:05.150
So if you present subjects the images such

00:08:05.150 --> 00:08:08.150
that it's going to end up on the right hemisphere instead of the left,

00:08:08.150 --> 00:08:10.150
then they're more likely to see patterns

00:08:10.150 --> 00:08:12.150
than if you put it on the left hemisphere.

00:08:12.150 --> 00:08:14.150
Our right hemisphere appears to be

00:08:14.150 --> 00:08:16.150
where a lot of this patternicity occurs.

00:08:16.150 --> 00:08:18.150
So what we're trying to do is bore into the brain

00:08:18.150 --> 00:08:20.150
to see where all this happens.

00:08:20.150 --> 00:08:23.150
Brugger and his colleague, Christine Mohr,

00:08:23.150 --> 00:08:25.150
gave subjects L-DOPA.

00:08:25.150 --> 00:08:28.150
L-DOPA's a drug, as you know, given for treating Parkinson's disease,

00:08:28.150 --> 00:08:31.150
which is related to a decrease in dopamine.

00:08:31.150 --> 00:08:33.150
L-DOPA increases dopamine.

00:08:33.150 --> 00:08:35.150
An increase of dopamine caused

00:08:35.150 --> 00:08:37.150
subjects to see more patterns

00:08:37.150 --> 00:08:39.150
than those that did not receive the dopamine.

00:08:39.150 --> 00:08:41.150
So dopamine appears to be the drug

00:08:41.150 --> 00:08:43.150
associated with patternicity.

00:08:43.150 --> 00:08:45.150
In fact, neuroleptic drugs

00:08:45.150 --> 00:08:47.150
that are used to eliminate psychotic behavior,

00:08:47.150 --> 00:08:49.150
things like paranoia, delusions

00:08:49.150 --> 00:08:51.150
and hallucinations,

00:08:51.150 --> 00:08:53.150
these are patternicities.

00:08:53.150 --> 00:08:56.150
They're incorrect patterns. They're false positives. They're Type I errors.

00:08:56.150 --> 00:08:58.150
And if you give them drugs

00:08:58.150 --> 00:09:00.150
that are dopamine antagonists,

00:09:00.150 --> 00:09:02.150
they go away.

00:09:02.150 --> 00:09:04.150
That is, you decrease the amount of dopamine,

00:09:04.150 --> 00:09:06.150
and their tendency to see

00:09:06.150 --> 00:09:08.150
patterns like that decreases.

00:09:08.150 --> 00:09:11.150
On the other hand, amphetamines like cocaine

00:09:11.150 --> 00:09:13.150
are dopamine agonists.

00:09:13.150 --> 00:09:15.150
They increase the amount of dopamine.

00:09:15.150 --> 00:09:18.150
So you're more likely to feel in a euphoric state,

00:09:18.150 --> 00:09:20.150
creativity, find more patterns.

00:09:20.150 --> 00:09:22.150
In fact, I saw Robin Williams recently

00:09:22.150 --> 00:09:24.150
talk about how he thought he was much funnier

00:09:24.150 --> 00:09:27.150
when he was doing cocaine, when he had that issue, than now.

00:09:27.150 --> 00:09:29.150
So perhaps more dopamine

00:09:29.150 --> 00:09:31.150
is related to more creativity.

00:09:31.150 --> 00:09:33.150
Dopamine, I think, changes

00:09:33.150 --> 00:09:35.150
our signal-to-noise ratio.

00:09:35.150 --> 00:09:37.150
That is, how accurate we are

00:09:37.150 --> 00:09:39.150
in finding patterns.

00:09:39.150 --> 00:09:42.150
If it's too low, you're more likely to make too many Type II errors.

00:09:42.150 --> 00:09:44.150
You miss the real patterns. You don't want to be too skeptical.

00:09:44.150 --> 00:09:47.150
If you're too skeptical, you'll miss the really interesting good ideas.

00:09:48.150 --> 00:09:51.150
Just right, you're creative, and yet you don't fall for too much baloney.

00:09:51.150 --> 00:09:54.150
Too high and maybe you see patterns everywhere.

00:09:54.150 --> 00:09:57.150
Every time somebody looks at you, you think people are staring at you.

00:09:57.150 --> 00:09:59.150
You think people are talking about you.

00:09:59.150 --> 00:10:01.150
And if you go too far on that, that's just simply

00:10:01.150 --> 00:10:03.150
labeled as madness.

00:10:03.150 --> 00:10:05.150
It's a distinction perhaps we might make

00:10:05.150 --> 00:10:07.150
between two Nobel laureates, Richard Feynman

00:10:07.150 --> 00:10:09.150
and John Nash.

00:10:09.150 --> 00:10:11.150
One sees maybe just the right number

00:10:11.150 --> 00:10:13.150
of patterns to win a Nobel Prize.

00:10:13.150 --> 00:10:15.150
The other one also, but maybe too many patterns.

00:10:15.150 --> 00:10:18.150
And we then call that schizophrenia.

00:10:18.150 --> 00:10:21.150
So the signal-to-noise ratio then presents us with a pattern-detection problem.

00:10:21.150 --> 00:10:23.150
And of course you all know exactly

00:10:23.150 --> 00:10:25.150
what this is, right?

00:10:25.150 --> 00:10:27.150
And what pattern do you see here?

00:10:27.150 --> 00:10:30.150
Again, I'm putting your anterior cingulate cortex to the test here,

00:10:30.150 --> 00:10:33.150
causing you conflicting pattern detections.

00:10:33.150 --> 00:10:35.150
You know, of course, this is Via Uno shoes.

00:10:35.150 --> 00:10:38.150
These are sandals.

00:10:38.150 --> 00:10:41.150
Pretty sexy feet, I must say.

00:10:41.150 --> 00:10:43.150
Maybe a little Photoshopped.

00:10:43.150 --> 00:10:45.150
And of course, the ambiguous figures

00:10:45.150 --> 00:10:47.150
that seem to flip-flop back and forth.

00:10:47.150 --> 00:10:49.150
It turns out what you're thinking about a lot

00:10:49.150 --> 00:10:51.150
influences what you

00:10:51.150 --> 00:10:53.150
tend to see.

00:10:53.150 --> 00:10:55.150
And you see the lamp here, I know.

00:10:55.150 --> 00:10:58.150
Because the lights on here.

00:10:58.150 --> 00:11:00.150
Of course, thanks to the environmentalist movement

00:11:00.150 --> 00:11:03.150
we're all sensitive to the plight of marine mammals.

00:11:03.150 --> 00:11:06.150
So what you see in this particular ambiguous figure

00:11:06.150 --> 00:11:08.150
is, of course, the dolphins, right?

00:11:08.150 --> 00:11:10.150
You see a dolphin here,

00:11:10.150 --> 00:11:12.150
and there's a dolphin,

00:11:12.150 --> 00:11:14.150
and there's a dolphin.

00:11:14.150 --> 00:11:17.150
That's a dolphin tail there, guys.

00:11:17.150 --> 00:11:20.150
(Laughter)

00:11:22.150 --> 00:11:25.150
If we can give you conflicting data, again,

00:11:25.150 --> 00:11:28.150
your ACC is going to be going into hyperdrive.

00:11:28.150 --> 00:11:31.150
If you look down here, it's fine. If you look up here, then you get conflicting data.

00:11:31.150 --> 00:11:33.150
And then we have to flip the image

00:11:33.150 --> 00:11:35.150
for you to see that it's a set up.

00:11:37.150 --> 00:11:39.150
The impossible crate illusion.

00:11:39.150 --> 00:11:41.150
It's easy to fool the brain in 2D.

00:11:41.150 --> 00:11:43.150
So you say, "Aw, come on Shermer, anybody can do that

00:11:43.150 --> 00:11:45.150
in a Psych 101 text with an illusion like that."

00:11:45.150 --> 00:11:47.150
Well here's the late, great Jerry Andrus'

00:11:47.150 --> 00:11:50.150
"impossible crate" illusion in 3D,

00:11:50.150 --> 00:11:52.150
in which Jerry is standing inside

00:11:52.150 --> 00:11:54.150
the impossible crate.

00:11:54.150 --> 00:11:56.150
And he was kind enough to post this

00:11:56.150 --> 00:11:58.150
and give us the reveal.

00:11:58.150 --> 00:12:01.150
Of course, camera angle is everything. The photographer is over there,

00:12:01.150 --> 00:12:04.150
and this board appears to overlap with this one, and this one with that one, and so on.

00:12:04.150 --> 00:12:06.150
But even when I take it away,

00:12:06.150 --> 00:12:08.150
the illusion is so powerful because of how are brains are wired

00:12:08.150 --> 00:12:11.150
to find those certain kinds of patterns.

00:12:11.150 --> 00:12:13.150
This is a fairly new one

00:12:13.150 --> 00:12:15.150
that throws us off because of the conflicting patterns

00:12:15.150 --> 00:12:18.150
of comparing this angle with that angle.

00:12:18.150 --> 00:12:21.150
In fact, it's the exact same picture side by side.

00:12:21.150 --> 00:12:23.150
So what you're doing is comparing that angle

00:12:23.150 --> 00:12:25.150
instead of with this one, but with that one.

00:12:25.150 --> 00:12:27.150
And so your brain is fooled.

00:12:27.150 --> 00:12:29.150
Yet again, your pattern detection devices are fooled.

00:12:29.150 --> 00:12:31.150
Faces are easy to see

00:12:31.150 --> 00:12:33.150
because we have an additional evolved

00:12:33.150 --> 00:12:35.150
facial recognition software

00:12:35.150 --> 00:12:38.150
in our temporal lobes.

00:12:38.150 --> 00:12:41.150
Here's some faces on the side of a rock.

00:12:41.150 --> 00:12:44.150
I'm actually not even sure if this is -- this might be Photoshopped.

00:12:44.150 --> 00:12:46.150
But anyway, the point is still made.

00:12:46.150 --> 00:12:48.150
Now which one of these looks odd to you?

00:12:48.150 --> 00:12:50.150
In a quick reaction, which one looks odd?

00:12:50.150 --> 00:12:52.150
The one on the left. Okay. So I'll rotate it

00:12:52.150 --> 00:12:54.150
so it'll be the one on the right.

00:12:54.150 --> 00:12:56.150
And you are correct.

00:12:56.150 --> 00:12:59.150
A fairly famous illusion -- it was first done with Margaret Thatcher.

00:12:59.150 --> 00:13:01.150
Now, they trade up the politicians every time.

00:13:01.150 --> 00:13:03.150
Well, why is this happening?

00:13:03.150 --> 00:13:05.150
Well, we know exactly where it happens,

00:13:05.150 --> 00:13:08.150
in the temporal lobe, right across, sort of above your ear there,

00:13:08.150 --> 00:13:11.150
in a little structure called the fusiform gyrus.

00:13:11.150 --> 00:13:13.150
And there's two types of cells that do this,

00:13:13.150 --> 00:13:16.150
that record facial features either globally,

00:13:16.150 --> 00:13:18.150
or specifically these large, rapid-firing cells,

00:13:18.150 --> 00:13:20.150
first look at the general face.

00:13:20.150 --> 00:13:22.150
So you recognize Obama immediately.

00:13:22.150 --> 00:13:24.150
And then you notice something quite

00:13:24.150 --> 00:13:26.150
a little bit odd about the eyes and the mouth.

00:13:26.150 --> 00:13:28.150
Especially when they're upside down,

00:13:28.150 --> 00:13:31.150
you're engaging that general facial recognition software there.

00:13:31.150 --> 00:13:34.150
Now I said back in our little thought experiment,

00:13:34.150 --> 00:13:36.150
you're a hominid walking on the plains of Africa.

00:13:36.150 --> 00:13:39.150
Is it just the wind or a dangerous predator?

00:13:39.150 --> 00:13:41.150
What's the difference between those?

00:13:41.150 --> 00:13:43.150
Well, the wind is inanimate;

00:13:43.150 --> 00:13:45.150
the dangerous predator is an intentional agent.

00:13:45.150 --> 00:13:47.150
And I call this process agenticity.

00:13:47.150 --> 00:13:49.150
That is the tendency to infuse patterns

00:13:49.150 --> 00:13:51.150
with meaning, intention and agency,

00:13:51.150 --> 00:13:54.150
often invisible beings from the top down.

00:13:54.150 --> 00:13:56.150
This is an idea that we got

00:13:56.150 --> 00:13:58.150
from a fellow TEDster here, Dan Dennett,

00:13:58.150 --> 00:14:00.150
who talked about taking the intentional stance.

00:14:00.150 --> 00:14:03.150
So it's a type of that expanded to explain, I think, a lot of different things:

00:14:03.150 --> 00:14:06.150
souls, spirits, ghosts, gods, demons, angels,

00:14:06.150 --> 00:14:08.150
aliens, intelligent designers,

00:14:08.150 --> 00:14:10.150
government conspiracists

00:14:10.150 --> 00:14:12.150
and all manner of invisible agents

00:14:12.150 --> 00:14:14.150
with power and intention, are believed

00:14:14.150 --> 00:14:16.150
to haunt our world and control our lives.

00:14:16.150 --> 00:14:18.150
I think it's the basis of animism

00:14:18.150 --> 00:14:21.150
and polytheism and monotheism.

00:14:21.150 --> 00:14:23.150
It's the belief that aliens are somehow

00:14:23.150 --> 00:14:25.150
more advanced than us, more moral than us,

00:14:25.150 --> 00:14:27.150
and the narratives always are

00:14:27.150 --> 00:14:30.150
that they're coming here to save us and rescue us from on high.

00:14:30.150 --> 00:14:32.150
The intelligent designer's always portrayed

00:14:32.150 --> 00:14:35.150
as this super intelligent, moral being

00:14:35.150 --> 00:14:37.150
that comes down to design life.

00:14:37.150 --> 00:14:39.150
Even the idea that government can rescue us --

00:14:39.150 --> 00:14:41.150
that's no longer the wave of the future,

00:14:41.150 --> 00:14:43.150
but that is, I think, a type of agenticity:

00:14:43.150 --> 00:14:45.150
projecting somebody up there,

00:14:45.150 --> 00:14:47.150
big and powerful, will come rescue us.

00:14:47.150 --> 00:14:49.150
And this is also, I think, the basis of conspiracy theories.

00:14:49.150 --> 00:14:52.150
There's somebody hiding behind there pulling the strings,

00:14:52.150 --> 00:14:54.150
whether it's the Illuminati

00:14:54.150 --> 00:14:56.150
or the Bilderbergers.

00:14:56.150 --> 00:14:58.150
But this is a pattern detection problem, isn't it?

00:14:58.150 --> 00:15:00.150
Some patterns are real and some are not.

00:15:00.150 --> 00:15:03.150
Was JFK assassinated by a conspiracy or by a lone assassin?

00:15:03.150 --> 00:15:06.150
Well, if you go there -- there's people there on any given day --

00:15:06.150 --> 00:15:09.150
like when I went there, here -- showing me where the different shooters were.

00:15:09.150 --> 00:15:12.150
My favorite one was he was in the manhole.

00:15:12.150 --> 00:15:15.150
And he popped out at the last second, took that shot.

00:15:15.150 --> 00:15:17.150
But of course, Lincoln was assassinated by a conspiracy.

00:15:17.150 --> 00:15:19.150
So we can't just uniformly dismiss

00:15:19.150 --> 00:15:21.150
all patterns like that.

00:15:21.150 --> 00:15:23.150
Because, let's face it, some patterns are real.

00:15:23.150 --> 00:15:25.150
Some conspiracies really are true.

00:15:27.150 --> 00:15:29.150
Explains a lot, maybe.

00:15:29.150 --> 00:15:32.150
And 9/11 has a conspiracy theory. It is a conspiracy.

00:15:32.150 --> 00:15:34.150
We did a whole issue on it.

00:15:34.150 --> 00:15:36.150
Nineteen members of Al Queda plotting to fly planes into buildings

00:15:36.150 --> 00:15:38.150
constitutes a conspiracy.

00:15:38.150 --> 00:15:40.150
But that's not what the "9/11 truthers" think.

00:15:40.150 --> 00:15:43.150
They think it was an inside job by the Bush administration.

00:15:43.150 --> 00:15:45.150
Well, that's a whole other lecture.

00:15:45.150 --> 00:15:47.150
You know how we know that 9/11

00:15:47.150 --> 00:15:49.150
was not orchestrated by the Bush administration?

00:15:49.150 --> 00:15:51.150
Because it worked.

00:15:51.150 --> 00:15:54.150
(Laughter)

00:15:54.150 --> 00:15:57.150
(Applause)

00:15:57.150 --> 00:15:59.150
So we are natural-born dualists.

00:15:59.150 --> 00:16:01.150
Our agenticity process comes from

00:16:01.150 --> 00:16:03.150
the fact that we can enjoy movies like these.

00:16:03.150 --> 00:16:05.150
Because we can imagine, in essence,

00:16:05.150 --> 00:16:07.150
continuing on.

00:16:07.150 --> 00:16:09.150
We know that if you stimulate the temporal lobe,

00:16:09.150 --> 00:16:11.150
you can produce a feeling of out-of-body experiences,

00:16:11.150 --> 00:16:13.150
near-death experiences,

00:16:13.150 --> 00:16:16.150
which you can do by just touching an electrode to the temporal lobe there.

00:16:16.150 --> 00:16:18.150
Or you can do it through loss of consciousness,

00:16:18.150 --> 00:16:20.150
by accelerating in a centrifuge.

00:16:20.150 --> 00:16:23.150
You get a hypoxia, or a lower oxygen.

00:16:23.150 --> 00:16:25.150
And the brain then senses

00:16:25.150 --> 00:16:27.150
that there's an out-of-body experience.

00:16:27.150 --> 00:16:29.150
You can use -- which I did, went out and did --

00:16:29.150 --> 00:16:31.150
Michael Persinger's God Helmet,

00:16:31.150 --> 00:16:33.150
that bombards your temporal lobes with electromagnetic waves.

00:16:33.150 --> 00:16:36.150
And you get a sense of out-of-body experience.

00:16:36.150 --> 00:16:38.150
So I'm going to end here with a short video clip

00:16:38.150 --> 00:16:40.150
that sort of brings all this together.

00:16:40.150 --> 00:16:42.150
It's just a minute and a half.

00:16:42.150 --> 00:16:45.150
It ties together all this into the power of expectation and the power of belief.

00:16:45.150 --> 00:16:47.150
Go ahead and roll it.

00:16:47.150 --> 00:16:50.150
Narrator: This is the venue they chose for their fake auditions

00:16:50.150 --> 00:16:52.150
for an advert for lip balm.

00:16:52.150 --> 00:16:54.150
Woman: We're hoping we can use part of this

00:16:54.150 --> 00:16:56.150
in a national commercial, right?

00:16:56.150 --> 00:16:58.150
And this is test on some lip balms

00:16:58.150 --> 00:17:00.150
that we have over here.

00:17:00.150 --> 00:17:02.150
And these are our models who are going to help us,

00:17:02.150 --> 00:17:04.150
Roger and Matt.

00:17:04.150 --> 00:17:06.150
And we have our own lip balm,

00:17:06.150 --> 00:17:08.150
and we have a leading brand.

00:17:08.150 --> 00:17:10.150
Would you have any problem

00:17:10.150 --> 00:17:12.150
kissing our models to test it?

00:17:12.150 --> 00:17:14.150
Girl: No.

00:17:14.150 --> 00:17:16.150
Woman: You wouldn't? (Girl: No.) Woman: You'd think that was fine.

00:17:16.150 --> 00:17:18.150
Girl: That would be fine. (Woman: Okay.)

00:17:18.150 --> 00:17:21.150
So this is a blind test.

00:17:21.150 --> 00:17:23.150
I'm going to ask you to go ahead

00:17:23.150 --> 00:17:25.150
and put a blindfold on.

00:17:26.150 --> 00:17:29.150
Kay, now can you see anything? (Girl: No.)

00:17:29.150 --> 00:17:31.150
Pull it so you can't even see down. (Girl: Okay.)

00:17:31.150 --> 00:17:33.150
Woman: It's completely blind now, right?

00:17:33.150 --> 00:17:35.150
Girl: Yes. (Woman: Okay.)

00:17:35.150 --> 00:17:38.150
Now, what I'm going to be looking for in this test

00:17:38.150 --> 00:17:41.150
is how it protects your lips,

00:17:41.150 --> 00:17:43.150
the texture, right,

00:17:43.150 --> 00:17:46.150
and maybe if you can discern any flavor or not.

00:17:46.150 --> 00:17:49.150
Girl: Okay. (Woman: Have you ever done a kissing test before?)

00:17:49.150 --> 00:17:51.150
Girl: No.

00:17:51.150 --> 00:17:53.150
Woman: Take a step here.

00:17:53.150 --> 00:17:55.150
Okay, now I'm going to ask you to pucker up.

00:17:55.150 --> 00:17:58.150
Pucker up big and lean in just a little bit, okay?

00:18:03.150 --> 00:18:07.150
(Music)

00:18:07.150 --> 00:18:12.150
(Laughter)

00:18:16.150 --> 00:18:19.150
(Laughter)

00:18:27.150 --> 00:18:29.150
Woman: Okay.

00:18:29.150 --> 00:18:31.150
And, Jennifer, how did that feel?

00:18:31.150 --> 00:18:33.150
Jennifer: Good.

00:18:33.150 --> 00:18:40.150
(Laughter)

00:18:40.150 --> 00:18:42.150
Girl: Oh my God!

00:18:42.150 --> 00:18:46.150
(Laughter)

00:18:47.150 --> 00:18:50.150
Michael Shermer: Thank you very much. Thank you. Thanks.
