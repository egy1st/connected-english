WEBVTT

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:14.150
It's a great honor today

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:16.150
to share with you

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:18.150
The Digital Universe,

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:20.150
which was created for humanity

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:22.150
to really see where we are

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:25.150
in the universe.

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:27.150
And so I think we can roll the video that we have.

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.150
[The Himalayas.]

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.150
(Music)

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:35.150
The flat horizon that we've evolved with

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:37.150
has been a metaphor for the

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:39.150
infinite: unbounded resources

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:41.150
and unlimited capacity

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:44.150
for disposal of waste.

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:46.150
It wasn't until we really

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:48.150
left Earth,

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:50.150
got above the atmosphere

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:52.150
and had seen the horizon

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:55.150
bend back on itself,

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:57.150
that we could understand our planet

00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:00.150
as a limited condition.

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:04.150
The Digital Universe Atlas

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.150
has been built

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:11.150
at the American Museum of Natural History

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:14.150
over the past 12 years.

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:16.150
We maintain that,

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:18.150
put that together

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.150
as a project

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:22.150
to really chart the universe

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:24.150
across all scales.

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:29.150
What we see here are satellites around the Earth

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:32.150
and the Earth in proper registration

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:35.150
against the universe, as we see.

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.150
NASA supported this work

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:44.150
12 years ago

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:46.150
as part of the rebuilding

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:48.150
of the Hayden Planetarium

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:51.150
so that we would share this with the world.

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:53.150
The Digital Universe is the basis

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:55.150
of our space show productions that we do --

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:58.150
our main space shows in the dome.

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:00.150
But what you see here

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:02.150
is the result of, actually, internships

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:05.150
that we hosted with Linkoping University

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:07.150
in Sweden.

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:10.150
I've had 12 students work on this

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:12.150
for their graduate work,

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:15.150
and the result has been this software called Uniview

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:18.150
and a company called SCISS in Sweden.

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:21.150
This software

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:24.150
allows interactive use,

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:26.150
so this actual flight path

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:28.150
and movie that we see here

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:30.150
was actually flown live.

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:33.150
I captured this live from my laptop

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:36.150
in a cafe called Earth Matters

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:39.150
on the Lower East Side of Manhattan, where I live,

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:41.150
and it was done

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:43.150
as a collaborative project

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:46.150
with the Rubin Museum of Himalayan Art

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:49.150
for an exhibit

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:52.150
on comparative cosmology.

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:55.150
And so as we move out,

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:58.150
we see continuously from our planet

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:01.150
all the way out into the realm of galaxies, as we see here,

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:04.150
light-travel time, giving you a sense of how far away we are.

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:08.150
As we move out,

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:10.150
the light from these distant galaxies

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:12.150
have taken so long,

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:15.150
we're essentially backing up into the past.

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:17.150
We back so far up

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:20.150
we're finally seeing a containment around us --

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:22.150
the afterglow of the Big Bang.

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:24.150
This is the WMAP

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:26.150
microwave background

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:28.150
that we see.

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:31.150
We'll fly outside it here, just to see this sort of containment.

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:33.150
If we were outside this,

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:36.150
it would almost be meaningless, in the sense as before time.

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:39.150
But this our containment of the visible universe.

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:41.150
We know the universe is bigger than that which we can see.

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:43.150
Coming back quickly,

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:46.150
we see here the radio sphere that we jumped out of in the beginning,

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:48.150
but these are positions,

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:51.150
the latest positions of exoplanets

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:53.150
that we've mapped,

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:56.150
and our sun here, obviously, with our own solar system.

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:01.150
What you're going to see -- we're going to have to jump in here pretty quickly

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:03.150
between several orders of magnitude

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:05.150
to get down to where we see the solar system --

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:07.150
these are the paths of

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:10.150
Voyager 1, Voyager 2, Pioneer 11 and Pioneer 10,

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:13.150
the first four spacecraft to have left the solar system.

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:17.150
Coming in closer,

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:20.150
picking up Earth,

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:24.150
orbit of the Moon, and we see the Earth.

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:30.150
This map can be updated,

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:32.150
and we can add in new data.

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:34.150
I know Dr. Carolyn Porco is the camera P.I.

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:36.150
for the Cassini mission.

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:38.150
But here we see the complex trajectory

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:40.150
of the Cassini mission

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:42.150
color coded for different mission phases,

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:44.150
ingeniously developed so that

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:46.150
45 encounters with the largest moon, Titan,

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:48.150
which is larger that the planet Mercury,

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:51.150
diverts the orbit into different parts of mission phase.

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:55.150
This software allows us to come close

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:58.150
and look at parts of this.

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:01.150
This software can also be networked between domes.

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:03.150
We have a growing user base of this,

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:05.150
and we network domes.

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:08.150
And we can network between domes and classrooms.

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:12.150
We're actually sharing tours of the universe

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:14.150
with the first sub-Saharan

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:16.150
planetarium in Ghana

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:18.150
as well as

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:20.150
new libraries that have been built

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:22.150
in the ghettos in Columbia

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:24.150
and a high school

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:26.150
in Cambodia.

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:28.150
And the Cambodians have

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:31.150
actually controlled the Hayden Planetarium from their high school.

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:34.150
This is an image from Saturday,

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:37.150
photographed by the Aqua satellite, but through the Uniview software.

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:39.150
So you're seeing the edge of the Earth.

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:41.150
This is Nepal.

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:44.150
This is, in fact, right here is the valley of Lhasa,

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:47.150
right here in Tibet.

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:49.150
But we can see the haze

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:51.150
from fires and so forth in the Ganges valley

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:53.150
down below in India.

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:56.150
This is Nepal and Tibet.

00:05:57.150 --> 00:06:00.150
And just in closing,

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:03.150
I'd just like to say this beautiful world that we live on --

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:07.150
here we see a bit of the snow

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:10.150
that some of you may have had to brave in coming out --

00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:14.150
so I'd like to just say

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:16.150
that what the world needs now

00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:18.150
is a sense of being able to

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:21.150
look at ourselves in this much larger condition now

00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:24.150
and a much larger sense of what home is.

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:26.150
Because our home is the universe,

00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:28.150
and we are the universe, essentially.

00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:30.150
We carry that in us.

00:06:30.150 --> 00:06:33.150
And to be able to see our context

00:06:33.150 --> 00:06:36.150
in this larger sense at all scales

00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:38.150
helps us all, I think, in understanding

00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:40.150
where we are and who we are in the universe.

00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:42.150
Thank you.

00:06:42.150 --> 00:06:46.150
(Applause)
