WEBVTT

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.150
Come with me to the bottom of the world,

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:17.150
Antarctica,

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:19.150
the highest, driest, windiest,

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:22.150
and yes, coldest region on Earth --

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:24.150
more arid than the Sahara

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.150
and, in parts, colder than Mars.

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:28.150
The ice of Antarctica glows

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:30.150
with a light so dazzling,

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.150
it blinds the unprotected eye.

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:34.150
Early explorers rubbed cocaine in their eyes

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:36.150
to kill the pain of it.

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:39.150
The weight of the ice is such that the entire continent

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:42.150
sags below sea level, beneath its weight.

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:44.150
Yet, the ice of Antarctica

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:46.150
is a calendar of climate change.

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:48.150
It records the annual rise and fall

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:50.150
of greenhouse gases and temperatures

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:53.150
going back before the onset of the last ice ages.

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:55.150
Nowhere on Earth

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:58.150
offers us such a perfect record.

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:00.150
And here, scientists are drilling

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:02.150
into the past of our planet

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:04.150
to find clues to the future

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:06.150
of climate change.

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.150
This past January,

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:10.150
I traveled to a place called WAIS Divide,

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:12.150
about 600 miles from the South Pole.

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.150
It is the best place on the planet, many say,

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.150
to study the history of climate change.

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:20.150
There, about 45 scientists from the University of Wisconsin,

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:23.150
the Desert Research Institute in Nevada and others

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:25.150
have been working to answer a central question

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:27.150
about global warming.

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.150
What is the exact relationship

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:32.150
between levels of greenhouse gases

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:34.150
and planetary temperatures?

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:37.150
It's urgent work. We know that temperatures are rising.

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:40.150
This past May was the warmest worldwide on record.

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:43.150
And we know that levels of greenhouse gases are rising too.

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:45.150
What we don't know

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:47.150
is the exact, precise, immediate

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:49.150
impact of these changes

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:51.150
on natural climate patterns --

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:53.150
winds, ocean currents,

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:56.150
precipitation rates, cloud formation,

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:58.150
things that bear on the health and well-being

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:01.150
of billions of people.

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:04.150
Their entire camp, every item of gear,

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:06.150
was ferried 885 miles

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:08.150
from McMurdo Station,

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:10.150
the main U.S. supply base

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:12.150
on the coast of Antarctica.

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:14.150
WAIS Divide itself though,

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:17.150
is a circle of tents in the snow.

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:20.150
In blizzard winds, the crew sling ropes between the tents

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:23.150
so that people can feel their way safely

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:25.150
to the nearest ice house

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:27.150
and to the nearest outhouse.

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:29.150
It snows so heavily there,

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:31.150
the installation was almost immediately buried.

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:34.150
Indeed, the researchers picked this site

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:36.150
because ice and snow accumulates here

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:39.150
10 times faster than anywhere else in Antarctica.

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:42.150
They have to dig themselves out every day.

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:44.150
It makes for an exotic

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:46.150
and chilly commute.

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:48.150
(Laughter)

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:50.150
But under the surface

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:53.150
is a hive of industrial activity

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:56.150
centered around an eight-million-dollar drill assembly.

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:59.150
Periodically, this drill, like a biopsy needle,

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:02.150
plunges thousands of feet deep into the ice

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:04.150
to extract a marrow of gases

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:07.150
and isotopes for analysis.

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:09.150
Ten times a day, they extract

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:11.150
the 10-foot long cylinder of compressed ice crystals

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:14.150
that contain the unsullied air and trace chemicals

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:16.150
laid down by snow,

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:19.150
season after season for thousands of years.

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:23.150
It's really a time machine.

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:26.150
At the peak of activity earlier this year,

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:29.150
the researchers lowered the drill

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:32.150
an extra hundred feet deeper into the ice every day

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:34.150
and another 365 years

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:37.150
deeper into the past.

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:39.150
Periodically, they remove

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:41.150
a cylinder of ice,

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:43.150
like gamekeepers popping a spent shotgun shell

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:46.150
from the barrel of a drill.

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:49.150
They inspect it, they check it for cracks,

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:52.150
for drill damage, for spalls, for chips.

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:55.150
More importantly,

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:57.150
they prepare it for inspection and analysis

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:59.150
by 27 independent laboratories

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:01.150
in the United States and Europe,

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:03.150
who will examine it for 40 different trace chemicals

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:05.150
related to climate,

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:08.150
some in parts per quadrillion.

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:11.150
Yes, I said that with a Q, quadrillion.

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:13.150
They cut the cylinders up into three-foot sections

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:15.150
for easier handling and shipment

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:17.150
back to these labs,

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:20.150
some 8,000 miles from the drill site.

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:22.150
Each cylinder

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:25.150
is a parfait of time.

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:28.150
This ice formed as snow

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:31.150
15,800 years ago,

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:34.150
when our ancestors were daubing themselves with paint

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:37.150
and considering the radical new technology

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:39.150
of the alphabet.

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:42.150
Bathed in polarized light

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:44.150
and cut in cross-section,

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:46.150
this ancient ice reveals itself

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:48.150
as a mosaic of colors,

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:51.150
each one showing how conditions at depth in the ice

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:54.150
have affected this material

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:57.150
at depths where pressures can reach

00:04:57.150 --> 00:05:00.150
a ton per square inch.

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:03.150
Every year, it begins with a snowflake,

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:05.150
and by digging into fresh snow,

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:08.150
we can see how this process is ongoing today.

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:10.150
This wall of undisturbed snow,

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:12.150
back-lit by sunlight,

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:15.150
shows the striations of winter and summer snow,

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:17.150
layer upon layer.

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:22.150
Each storm scours the atmosphere,

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:25.150
washing out dust, soot,

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:27.150
trace chemicals,

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:30.150
and depositing them on the snow pack

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:32.150
year after year,

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:34.150
millennia after millennia,

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:36.150
creating a kind of periodic table of elements

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:38.150
that at this point

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:41.150
is more than 11,000 feet thick.

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:44.150
From this, we can detect an extraordinary number of things.

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:48.150
We can see the calcium

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:50.150
from the world's deserts,

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:52.150
soot from distant wildfires,

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:55.150
methane as an indicator of the strength of a Pacific monsoon,

00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:58.150
all wafted on winds from warmer latitudes

00:05:58.150 --> 00:06:01.150
to this remote and very cold place.

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:03.150
Most importantly,

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:05.150
these cylinders and this snow

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:07.150
trap air.

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:10.150
Each cylinder is about 10 percent ancient air,

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:12.150
a pristine time capsule

00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:14.150
of greenhouse gases -- carbon dioxide,

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:16.150
methane, nitrous oxide --

00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:19.150
all unchanged from the day that snow formed

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:21.150
and first fell.

00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:24.150
And this is the object of their scrutiny.

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:26.150
But don't we already know

00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:28.150
what we need to know about greenhouse gases?

00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:30.150
Why do we need to study this anymore?

00:06:30.150 --> 00:06:32.150
Don't we already know how they affect temperatures?

00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:35.150
Don't we already know the consequences

00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:38.150
of a changing climate on our settled civilization?

00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:41.150
The truth is, we only know the outlines,

00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:43.150
and what we don't completely understand,

00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:45.150
we can't properly fix.

00:06:45.150 --> 00:06:48.150
Indeed, we run the risk of making things worse.

00:06:48.150 --> 00:06:51.150
Consider, the single most successful

00:06:51.150 --> 00:06:54.150
international environmental effort of the 20th century,

00:06:54.150 --> 00:06:56.150
the Montreal Protocol,

00:06:56.150 --> 00:06:59.150
in which the nations of Earth banded together to protect the planet

00:06:59.150 --> 00:07:02.150
from the harmful effects of ozone-destroying chemicals

00:07:02.150 --> 00:07:04.150
used at that time

00:07:04.150 --> 00:07:07.150
in air conditioners, refrigerators and other cooling devices.

00:07:07.150 --> 00:07:10.150
We banned those chemicals,

00:07:10.150 --> 00:07:12.150
and we replaced them, unknowingly,

00:07:12.150 --> 00:07:14.150
with other substances

00:07:14.150 --> 00:07:16.150
that, molecule per molecule,

00:07:16.150 --> 00:07:18.150
are a hundred times more potent

00:07:18.150 --> 00:07:20.150
as heat-trapping, greenhouse gases

00:07:20.150 --> 00:07:23.150
than carbon dioxide.

00:07:23.150 --> 00:07:25.150
This process requires

00:07:25.150 --> 00:07:28.150
extraordinary precautions.

00:07:28.150 --> 00:07:30.150
The scientists must insure

00:07:30.150 --> 00:07:32.150
that the ice is not contaminated.

00:07:32.150 --> 00:07:34.150
Moreover, in this 8,000-mile journey,

00:07:34.150 --> 00:07:36.150
they have to insure this ice doesn't melt.

00:07:36.150 --> 00:07:39.150
Imagine juggling a snowball across the tropics.

00:07:40.150 --> 00:07:42.150
They have to, in fact,

00:07:42.150 --> 00:07:44.150
make sure this ice never gets warmer

00:07:44.150 --> 00:07:46.150
than about 20 degrees below zero,

00:07:46.150 --> 00:07:49.150
otherwise, the key gases inside it will dissipate.

00:07:49.150 --> 00:07:52.150
So, in the coldest place on Earth,

00:07:52.150 --> 00:07:55.150
they work inside a refrigerator.

00:07:55.150 --> 00:07:57.150
As they handle the ice, in fact,

00:07:57.150 --> 00:07:59.150
they keep an extra pair of gloves warming in an oven,

00:07:59.150 --> 00:08:01.150
so that, when their work gloves freeze

00:08:01.150 --> 00:08:03.150
and their fingers stiffen,

00:08:03.150 --> 00:08:05.150
they can don a fresh pair.

00:08:05.150 --> 00:08:08.150
They work against the clock and against the thermometer.

00:08:08.150 --> 00:08:10.150
So far, they've packed up

00:08:10.150 --> 00:08:14.150
about 4,500 feet of ice cores

00:08:14.150 --> 00:08:16.150
for shipment back to the United States.

00:08:16.150 --> 00:08:18.150
This past season,

00:08:18.150 --> 00:08:20.150
they manhandled them across the ice

00:08:20.150 --> 00:08:22.150
to waiting aircraft.

00:08:22.150 --> 00:08:25.150
The 109th Air National Guard

00:08:25.150 --> 00:08:27.150
flew the most recent shipment of ice

00:08:27.150 --> 00:08:29.150
back to the coast of Antarctica,

00:08:29.150 --> 00:08:32.150
where it was boarded onto a freighter,

00:08:32.150 --> 00:08:35.150
shipped across the tropics to California,

00:08:35.150 --> 00:08:37.150
unloaded, put on a truck,

00:08:37.150 --> 00:08:39.150
driven across the desert

00:08:39.150 --> 00:08:41.150
to the National Ice Core Laboratory in Denver, Colorado,

00:08:41.150 --> 00:08:43.150
where, as we speak,

00:08:43.150 --> 00:08:45.150
scientists are now slicing this material up

00:08:45.150 --> 00:08:47.150
for samples, for analysis,

00:08:47.150 --> 00:08:49.150
to be distributed

00:08:49.150 --> 00:08:51.150
to the laboratories around the country

00:08:51.150 --> 00:08:53.150
and in Europe.

00:08:54.150 --> 00:08:57.150
Antarctica was this planet's

00:08:57.150 --> 00:08:59.150
last empty quarter --

00:08:59.150 --> 00:09:01.150
the blind spot

00:09:01.150 --> 00:09:03.150
in our expanding vision of the world.

00:09:03.150 --> 00:09:05.150
Early explorers

00:09:05.150 --> 00:09:07.150
sailed off the edge of the map,

00:09:07.150 --> 00:09:09.150
and they found a place

00:09:09.150 --> 00:09:11.150
where the normal rules of time and temperature

00:09:11.150 --> 00:09:14.150
seem suspended.

00:09:15.150 --> 00:09:18.150
Here, the ice seems a living presence.

00:09:18.150 --> 00:09:20.150
The wind that rubs against it

00:09:20.150 --> 00:09:23.150
gives it voice.

00:09:23.150 --> 00:09:26.150
It is a voice of experience.

00:09:26.150 --> 00:09:29.150
It is a voice we should heed.

00:09:30.150 --> 00:09:32.150
Thank you.

00:09:32.150 --> 00:09:36.150
(Applause)
