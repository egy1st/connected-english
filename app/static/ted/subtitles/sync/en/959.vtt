00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:14.150
Now, since this is TEDGlobal,

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:17.150
who can tell me what this is called in French?

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:20.150
I see you're all up on the history of hurdy-gurdy --

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:22.150
"vielle Ã  roue."

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:24.150
And in Spanish, "zanfona."

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.150
And in Italian, "ghironda," okay?

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:29.150
Hurdy-gurdy, or wheel fiddle.

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:32.150
So, these are the different kinds and shapes of the hurdy-gurdy.

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:35.150
The hurdy-gurdy is the only musical instrument

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:38.150
that uses a crank to turn a wheel

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:41.150
to rub strings, like the bow of a violin,

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:43.150
to produce music.

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:46.150
It has three different kinds of strings.

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:49.150
The first string is the drone string,

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:52.150
which plays a continuous sound like the bagpipe.

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:56.150
The second string is a melody string,

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:59.150
which is played with a wooden keyboard tuned like a piano.

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:07.150
And the third string is pretty innovative.

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:09.150
It's also the only instrument

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.150
that uses this kind of technique.

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.150
It activates what's called the buzzing bridge, or the dog.

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:19.150
When I turn the crank and I apply pressure,

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:25.150
it makes a sound like a barking dog.

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:28.150
So all of this is pretty innovative,

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:30.150
if you consider

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.150
that the hurdy-gurdy appeared about a thousand years ago

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:34.150
and it took two people to play it;

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:36.150
one to turn the crank,

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.150
and another person -- yes -- to play the melody

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:41.150
by physically pulling up large wooden pegs.

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:45.150
Luckily, all of this changed a couple of centuries later.

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:47.150
So, one person could actually play

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:49.150
and almost -- this is pretty heavy --

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:52.150
carry the hurdy-gurdy.

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:55.150
The hurdy-gurdy has been used, historically, through the centuries

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:57.150
in mostly dance music

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:00.150
because of the uniqueness of the melody

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:03.150
combined with the acoustic boombox here.

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:06.150
And today, the hurdy-gurdy is used in all sorts of music --

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:08.150
traditional folk music,

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:10.150
dance, contemporary

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:13.150
and world music --

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:15.150
in the U.K., in France, in Spain

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:17.150
and in Italy.

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:20.150
And this kind of hurdy-gurdy takes anywhere from three to five years [to order and receive it].

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:22.150
It's made by specialized luthiers,

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:24.150
also in Europe.

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:27.150
And it's very difficult to tune.

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:31.150
So without further ado, would you like to hear it?

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:33.150
(Audience: Yes.)

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:35.150
Caroline Phillips: I didn't hear you. Would you like to hear it? (Audience: Yes!)

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:37.150
CP: Okay.

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:39.150
There I go.

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:42.150
I'd like to sing in Basque,

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:45.150
which is the language spoken in the Basque Country where I live,

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:47.150
in the region in France and Spain.

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:52.150
(Music)

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:02.150
[Basque]

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:47.150
(Music)

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:35.150
Thank you.

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:37.150
(Applause)

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:40.150
This is a song that I wrote

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:43.150
based on traditional Basque rhythms.

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:46.150
And this is a song that has a kind of a Celtic feel.

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:57.150
(Music)

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:29.150
Thank you. Thank you.

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:31.150
(Applause)
