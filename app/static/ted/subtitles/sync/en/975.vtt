00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:16.150
Imagine, if you will -- a gift.

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:20.150
I'd like for you to picture it in your mind.

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:22.150
It's not too big --

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:24.150
about the size of a golf ball.

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.150
So envision what it looks like all wrapped up.

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.150
But before I show you what's inside,

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:33.150
I will tell you, it's going to do incredible things for you.

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:36.150
It will bring all of your family together.

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:40.150
You will feel loved and appreciated like never before

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:42.150
and reconnect with friends and acquaintances

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:44.150
you haven't heard from in years.

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:46.150
Adoration and admiration

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:49.150
will overwhelm you.

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:52.150
It will recalibrate what's most important in your life.

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:54.150
It will redefine your sense

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:57.150
of spirituality and faith.

00:00:57.150 --> 00:00:59.150
You'll have a new understanding

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:01.150
and trust in your body.

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:04.150
You'll have unsurpassed vitality and energy.

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:06.150
You'll expand your vocabulary,

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.150
meet new people,

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:11.150
and you'll have a healthier lifestyle.

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:13.150
And get this --

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:15.150
you'll have an eight-week vacation

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:18.150
of doing absolutely nothing.

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:21.150
You'll eat countless gourmet meals.

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:24.150
Flowers will arrive by the truckload.

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.150
People will say to you,

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:29.150
"You look great. Have you had any work done?"

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:31.150
And you'll have a lifetime supply

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:34.150
of good drugs.

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:37.150
You'll be challenged, inspired,

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:40.150
motivated and humbled.

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:43.150
Your life will have new meaning.

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:45.150
Peace, health,

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:48.150
serenity, happiness,

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:50.150
nirvana.

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:52.150
The price?

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:55.150
$55,000,

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:58.150
and that's an incredible deal.

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:00.150
By now I know you're dying to know

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:03.150
what it is and where you can get one.

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:05.150
Does Amazon carry it?

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:07.150
Does it have the Apple logo on it?

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:10.150
Is there a waiting list?

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:12.150
Not likely.

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:15.150
This gift came to me about five months ago.

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:17.150
It looked more like this when it was all wrapped up --

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:19.150
not quite so pretty.

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:22.150
And this,

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:26.150
and then this.

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:28.150
It was a rare gem --

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:30.150
a brain tumor,

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:33.150
hemangioblastoma --

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:36.150
the gift that keeps on giving.

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:38.150
And while I'm okay now,

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:40.150
I wouldn't wish this gift for you.

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:42.150
I'm not sure you'd want it.

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:45.150
But I wouldn't change my experience.

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:48.150
It profoundly altered my life

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:50.150
in ways I didn't expect

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:52.150
in all the ways I just shared with you.

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:54.150
So the next time you're faced

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:57.150
with something that's unexpected,

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:00.150
unwanted and uncertain,

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:02.150
consider

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:05.150
that it just may be a gift.

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:08.150
(Applause)
