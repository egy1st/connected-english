00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:14.150
Sustainability represents

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:16.150
the what, the where and the how

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:18.150
of what is caught.

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:20.150
The who and the why are what's important to me.

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:22.150
I want to know the people behind my dinner choices.

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:24.150
I want to know how I impact them.

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.150
I want to know how they impact me.

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:28.150
I want to know why they fish.

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:30.150
I want to know how they rely on the water's bounty

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.150
for their living.

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:34.150
Understanding all of this enables us

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:36.150
to shift our perception of seafood

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:38.150
away from a commodity

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:40.150
to an opportunity

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:42.150
to restore our ecosystem.

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:44.150
It allows for us to celebrate the seafood

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:46.150
that we're also so fortunate to eat.

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:48.150
So what do we call this?

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:51.150
I think we call it restorative seafood.

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:53.150
Where sustainability is the capacity

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:55.150
to endure and maintain,

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:58.150
restorative is the ability to replenish and progress.

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:01.150
Restorative seafood allows for an evolving and dynamic system

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:03.150
and acknowledges our relationship with the ocean

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:05.150
as a resource,

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:08.150
suggesting that we engage to replenish the ocean

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:10.150
and to encourage its resiliency.

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:13.150
It is a more hopeful, it is a more human,

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:16.150
and is a more useful way of understanding our environment.

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:20.150
Wallet guides -- standard issue

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:22.150
by lots in the marine conservation world --

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:25.150
are very handy; they're a wonderful tool.

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:28.150
Green, yellow and red lists [of] seafood species.

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:31.150
The association is very easy: buy green, don't buy red,

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:33.150
think twice about yellow.

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.150
But in my mind, it's really not enough

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:37.150
to just eat green list.

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:40.150
We can't sustain this without the measure of our success

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:42.150
really changing the fate of the species

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.150
in the yellow and the red.

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:47.150
But what if we eat only in the green list?

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:50.150
You've got pole-caught yellowfin tuna here --

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:52.150
comes from sustainable stocks.

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:54.150
Pole caught -- no bycatch.

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:57.150
Great for fishermen. Lots of money. Supporting local economies.

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:00.150
But it's a lion of the sea. It's a top predator.

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:02.150
What's the context of this meal?

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:05.150
Am I sitting down in a steakhouse to a 16-ounce portion of this?

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:07.150
Do I do this three times a week?

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:09.150
I might still be in the green list,

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:11.150
but I'm not doing myself, or you,

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:14.150
or the oceans any favors.

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:17.150
The point is that we have to have a context,

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:20.150
a gauge for our actions in all this.

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:23.150
Example: I've heard that red wine is great for my health --

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:25.150
antioxidants and minerals -- heart healthy.

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:27.150
That's great! I love red wine!

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:30.150
I'm going to drink so much of it. I'm going to be so healthy.

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:32.150
Well, how many bottles is it

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:34.150
before you tell me that I have a problem?

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:36.150
Well folks, we have a protein problem.

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:38.150
We have lost this sensibility

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:40.150
when it regards our food,

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:42.150
and we are paying a cost.

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:45.150
The problem is we are hiding that cost beneath the waves.

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:47.150
We are hiding that cost

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:49.150
behind the social acceptance of expanding waistlines.

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:52.150
And we are hiding that cost behind monster profits.

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:55.150
So the first thing about this idea of restorative seafood

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:58.150
is that it really takes into account our needs.

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:00.150
Restorative seafood might best be represented

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:02.150
not by Jaws, or by Flipper, or the Gordon's fisherman,

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:05.150
but rather, by the Jolly Green Giant.

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:07.150
Vegetables:

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:09.150
they might yet save the oceans.

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:11.150
Sylvia likes to say that blue is the new green.

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:13.150
Well I'd like to respectfully submit

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:16.150
that broccoli green might then be the new blue.

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:19.150
We must continue to eat

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:22.150
the best seafood possible, if at all.

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:25.150
But we also must eat it with a ton of vegetables.

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:27.150
The best part about restorative seafood though

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:29.150
is that it comes on the half-shell

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:31.150
with a bottle of Tabasco and lemon wedges.

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:33.150
It comes in a five-ounce portion of tilapia

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:36.150
breaded with Dijon mustard and crispy, broiled breadcrumbs

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:38.150
and a steaming pile of pecan quinoa pilaf

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:40.150
with crunchy, grilled broccoli

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:42.150
so soft and sweet and charred and smoky on the outside

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:44.150
with just a hint of chili flake.

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:46.150
Whooo!

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:48.150
This is an easy sell.

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:50.150
And the best part is all of those ingredients are available

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:53.150
to every family at the neighborhood Walmart.

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:56.150
Jamie Oliver is campaigning

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:59.150
to save America from the way we eat.

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:02.150
Sylvia is campaigning to save the oceans

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:04.150
from the way we eat.

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:06.150
There's a pattern here.

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:08.150
Forget nuclear holocaust;

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:11.150
it's the fork that we have to worry about.

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:13.150
We have ravaged our Earth

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:15.150
and then used the food that we've sourced

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:18.150
to handicap ourselves in more ways than one.

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:21.150
So I think we have this whole eating thing wrong.

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:23.150
And so I think it's time

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:25.150
we change what we expect from our food.

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:27.150
Sustainability is complicated

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:30.150
but dinner is a reality that we all very much understand.

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:32.150
So let's start there.

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:35.150
There's been a lot of movement recently in greening our food systems.

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:37.150
Dan Barber and Alice Waters

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:40.150
are leading passionately the green food Delicious Revolution.

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:42.150
But green foods often represent

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:44.150
a way for us to disregard

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:46.150
the responsibility as eaters.

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:48.150
Just because it comes from a green source

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:51.150
doesn't mean we can treat it with disregard on the plate.

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:54.150
We have eco-friendly shrimp.

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:56.150
We can make them; we have that technology.

00:04:56.150 --> 00:05:00.150
But we can never have any eco-friendly all-you-can-eat shrimp buffet.

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:02.150
It doesn't work.

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:05.150
Heart-healthy dinner is a very important part

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:07.150
of restorative seafood.

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:10.150
While we try to manage declining marine populations,

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:13.150
the media's recommending increased consumption of seafood.

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:15.150
Studies say that tens of thousands

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:17.150
of American grandmothers, grandfathers, mothers and fathers

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:19.150
might be around for another birthday

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:21.150
if we included more seafood.

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:24.150
That's a reward I am not willing to pass up.

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:26.150
But it's not all about the seafood.

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:29.150
It's about the way that we look at our plates.

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:31.150
As a chef, I realize the easiest thing for me to do

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:34.150
is reduce the portion sizes on my plate.

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:36.150
A couple things happened.

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:38.150
I made more money.

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:40.150
People started buying appetizers and salads,

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:43.150
because they knew they weren't going to fill up on the entrees alone.

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:45.150
People spent more time engaging in their meals,

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:48.150
engaging with each other over their meals.

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:51.150
People got, in short, more of what they came there for

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:53.150
even though they got less protein.

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:56.150
They got more calories over the course of a diversified meal.

00:05:56.150 --> 00:05:58.150
They got healthier. I made more money.

00:05:58.150 --> 00:06:00.150
This is great.

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:03.150
Environmental consideration was served with every plate,

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:05.150
but it was served with a heaping mound

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:08.150
of consideration for human interests at the same time.

00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:11.150
One of the other things we did

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:14.150
was begin to diversify the species that we served --

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:17.150
small silverfish, anchovies, mackerel, sardines were uncommon.

00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:19.150
Shellfish, mussels, oysters,

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:22.150
clams, tilapia, char -- these were the common species.

00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:24.150
We were directing tastes

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:27.150
towards more resilience, more restorative options.

00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:30.150
This is what we need to favor.

00:06:30.150 --> 00:06:32.150
This is what the green list says.

00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:35.150
But this is also how we can actually begin to restore our environment.

00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:37.150
But what of those big predators,

00:06:37.150 --> 00:06:39.150
those fashionable species,

00:06:39.150 --> 00:06:42.150
that green list tuna that I was talking about earlier?

00:06:42.150 --> 00:06:45.150
Well, if you must, I have a recipe for you.

00:06:45.150 --> 00:06:47.150
It pretty much works with any big fish in the ocean,

00:06:47.150 --> 00:06:49.150
so here we go.

00:06:49.150 --> 00:06:52.150
Start with a 16-ounce portion of big fish.

00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:55.150
Get a knife. Cut it into four portions.

00:06:55.150 --> 00:06:57.150
Put it on four plates.

00:06:57.150 --> 00:06:59.150
Mound up those four plates with vegetables

00:06:59.150 --> 00:07:01.150
and then open up the very best bottle of Burgundy you have,

00:07:01.150 --> 00:07:04.150
light the candles and celebrate it.

00:07:04.150 --> 00:07:06.150
Celebrate the opportunity you have to eat this.

00:07:06.150 --> 00:07:08.150
Invite your friends and neighbors over

00:07:08.150 --> 00:07:11.150
and repeat once a year,

00:07:11.150 --> 00:07:13.150
maybe.

00:07:13.150 --> 00:07:15.150
I expect a lot from food.

00:07:15.150 --> 00:07:17.150
I expect health

00:07:17.150 --> 00:07:19.150
and joy and family and community.

00:07:19.150 --> 00:07:21.150
I expect that producing ingredients,

00:07:21.150 --> 00:07:24.150
preparing dishes and eating meals

00:07:24.150 --> 00:07:27.150
is all part of the communion of human interests.

00:07:27.150 --> 00:07:29.150
I was lucky enough that my father was a fantastic cook.

00:07:29.150 --> 00:07:31.150
And he taught me very early on

00:07:31.150 --> 00:07:34.150
about the privilege that eating represents.

00:07:34.150 --> 00:07:36.150
I remember well the meals of my childhood.

00:07:36.150 --> 00:07:38.150
They were reasonable portions of protein

00:07:38.150 --> 00:07:40.150
served with copious quantities of vegetables

00:07:40.150 --> 00:07:42.150
and small amounts of starch, usually rice.

00:07:42.150 --> 00:07:45.150
This is still how I largely eat today.

00:07:45.150 --> 00:07:48.150
I get sick when I go to steakhouses.

00:07:48.150 --> 00:07:50.150
I get the meat sweats.

00:07:50.150 --> 00:07:52.150
It's like a hangover from protein.

00:07:52.150 --> 00:07:54.150
It's disgusting.

00:07:55.150 --> 00:07:58.150
But of all the dire news that you'll hear

00:07:58.150 --> 00:08:00.150
and that you have heard about the state of our oceans,

00:08:00.150 --> 00:08:02.150
I have the unfortunate burden of delivering to you

00:08:02.150 --> 00:08:04.150
possibly the very worst of it

00:08:04.150 --> 00:08:06.150
and that is this whole time

00:08:06.150 --> 00:08:08.150
your mother was right.

00:08:08.150 --> 00:08:11.150
Eat your vegetables.

00:08:11.150 --> 00:08:13.150
It's pretty straightforward.

00:08:13.150 --> 00:08:15.150
So what are we looking for in a meal?

00:08:15.150 --> 00:08:18.150
Well for health, I'm looking for wholesome ingredients

00:08:18.150 --> 00:08:20.150
that are good for my body.

00:08:20.150 --> 00:08:22.150
For joy, I'm looking for butter and salt

00:08:22.150 --> 00:08:25.150
and sexy things that make things taste less like penance.

00:08:25.150 --> 00:08:28.150
For family, I'm looking for recipes

00:08:28.150 --> 00:08:31.150
that genuflect to my own personal histories.

00:08:31.150 --> 00:08:34.150
For community though, we start at the very beginning.

00:08:34.150 --> 00:08:36.150
There's no escaping the fact

00:08:36.150 --> 00:08:38.150
that everything we eat has a global impact.

00:08:38.150 --> 00:08:40.150
So try and learn as best you can what that impact is

00:08:40.150 --> 00:08:43.150
and then take the first step to minimize it.

00:08:44.150 --> 00:08:46.150
We've seen an image of our blue planet,

00:08:46.150 --> 00:08:48.150
our world bank.

00:08:48.150 --> 00:08:51.150
But it is more than just a repository of our resources;

00:08:51.150 --> 00:08:54.150
it's also the global geography

00:08:54.150 --> 00:08:57.150
of the communion we call dinner.

00:08:57.150 --> 00:08:59.150
So if we all take only what we need,

00:08:59.150 --> 00:09:02.150
then we can begin to share the rest,

00:09:02.150 --> 00:09:04.150
we can begin to celebrate,

00:09:04.150 --> 00:09:06.150
we can begin to restore.

00:09:06.150 --> 00:09:08.150
We need to savor vegetables.

00:09:08.150 --> 00:09:11.150
We need to savor smaller portions of seafood.

00:09:11.150 --> 00:09:13.150
And we need to save dinner.

00:09:13.150 --> 00:09:15.150
Thank you.

00:09:15.150 --> 00:09:17.150
(Applause)
