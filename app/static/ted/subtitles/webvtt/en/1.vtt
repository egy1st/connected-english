WEBVTT

00:00:03.337 --> 00:00:04.528
Thank you so much, Chris.

00:00:04.552 --> 00:00:08.502
And it's truly a great honor
to have the opportunity

00:00:08.526 --> 00:00:11.530
to come to this stage twice;
I'm extremely grateful.

00:00:11.554 --> 00:00:15.088
I have been blown away by this conference,

00:00:15.112 --> 00:00:20.780
and I want to thank all of you
for the many nice comments

00:00:20.804 --> 00:00:22.976
about what I had to say the other night.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.875
And I say that sincerely,

00:00:25.899 --> 00:00:27.863
partly because (Mock sob)

00:00:27.887 --> 00:00:29.038
I need that.

00:00:29.062 --> 00:00:34.919
(Laughter)

00:00:34.943 --> 00:00:36.864
Put yourselves in my position.

00:00:36.888 --> 00:00:43.416
(Laughter)

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.997
I flew on Air Force Two for eight years.

00:00:46.021 --> 00:00:47.976
(Laughter)

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.364
Now I have to take off my shoes
or boots to get on an airplane!

00:00:51.388 --> 00:00:54.093
(Laughter)

00:00:54.117 --> 00:01:00.565
(Applause)

00:01:00.589 --> 00:01:02.312
I'll tell you one quick story

00:01:02.336 --> 00:01:05.455
to illustrate what
that's been like for me.

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:07.000
(Laughter)

00:01:07.024 --> 00:01:09.444
It's a true story --
every bit of this is true.

00:01:10.158 --> 00:01:13.743
Soon after Tipper and I left the --
(Mock sob) White House --

00:01:13.767 --> 00:01:15.785
(Laughter)

00:01:15.809 --> 00:01:20.724
we were driving from our home
in Nashville to a little farm we have

00:01:20.748 --> 00:01:22.739
50 miles east of Nashville.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.490
Driving ourselves.

00:01:25.514 --> 00:01:27.976
(Laughter)

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.717
I know it sounds like
a little thing to you, but --

00:01:30.741 --> 00:01:36.210
(Laughter)

00:01:36.234 --> 00:01:41.941
I looked in the rear-view mirror

00:01:41.965 --> 00:01:45.171
and all of a sudden it just hit me.

00:01:45.195 --> 00:01:46.831
There was no motorcade back there.

00:01:46.855 --> 00:01:49.509
(Laughter)

00:01:49.533 --> 00:01:51.526
You've heard of phantom limb pain?

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:56.362
(Laughter)

00:01:56.386 --> 00:02:00.602
This was a rented Ford Taurus.

00:02:00.626 --> 00:02:03.130
(Laughter)

00:02:03.154 --> 00:02:05.160
It was dinnertime,

00:02:05.184 --> 00:02:08.104
and we started looking for a place to eat.

00:02:08.588 --> 00:02:09.993
We were on I-40.

00:02:10.017 --> 00:02:13.214
We got to Exit 238, Lebanon, Tennessee.

00:02:13.238 --> 00:02:16.926
We got off the exit,
we found a Shoney's restaurant.

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:20.989
Low-cost family restaurant chain,
for those of you who don't know it.

00:02:21.877 --> 00:02:26.312
We went in and sat down at the booth,
and the waitress came over,

00:02:26.336 --> 00:02:28.322
made a big commotion over Tipper.

00:02:28.346 --> 00:02:30.809
(Laughter)

00:02:30.833 --> 00:02:34.253
She took our order, and then went
to the couple in the booth next to us,

00:02:34.277 --> 00:02:36.381
and she lowered her voice so much,

00:02:36.405 --> 00:02:39.406
I had to really strain to hear
what she was saying.

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:42.109
And she said "Yes, that's former
Vice President Al Gore

00:02:42.133 --> 00:02:43.976
and his wife, Tipper."

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.527
And the man said,

00:02:45.551 --> 00:02:47.743
"He's come down a long way, hasn't he?"

00:02:47.767 --> 00:02:52.675
(Laughter)

00:02:52.699 --> 00:02:56.976
(Applause)

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.119
There's been kind
of a series of epiphanies.

00:03:00.143 --> 00:03:01.287
(Laughter)

00:03:01.311 --> 00:03:04.976
The very next day,
continuing the totally true story,

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:10.976
I got on a G-V to fly to Africa
to make a speech in Nigeria,

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.856
in the city of Lagos,
on the topic of energy.

00:03:14.301 --> 00:03:18.097
And I began the speech
by telling them the story

00:03:18.121 --> 00:03:20.834
of what had just happened
the day before in Nashville.

00:03:21.196 --> 00:03:24.502
And I told it pretty much the same way
I've just shared it with you:

00:03:24.526 --> 00:03:26.264
Tipper and I were driving ourselves,

00:03:26.288 --> 00:03:28.326
Shoney's, low-cost
family restaurant chain,

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:30.283
what the man said -- they laughed.

00:03:30.703 --> 00:03:34.286
I gave my speech, then went back
out to the airport to fly back home.

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:36.176
I fell asleep on the plane

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:38.738
until, during the middle
of the night, we landed

00:03:38.762 --> 00:03:40.976
on the Azores Islands for refueling.

00:03:41.364 --> 00:03:44.476
I woke up, they opened the door,
I went out to get some fresh air,

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:47.976
and I looked, and there was a man
running across the runway.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.055
And he was waving a piece
of paper, and he was yelling,

00:03:51.079 --> 00:03:55.153
"Call Washington! Call Washington!"

00:03:55.981 --> 00:03:58.426
And I thought to myself,
in the middle of the night,

00:03:58.450 --> 00:03:59.886
in the middle of the Atlantic,

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:02.130
what in the world could be
wrong in Washington?

00:04:02.154 --> 00:04:04.415
Then I remembered
it could be a bunch of things.

00:04:04.439 --> 00:04:09.976
(Laughter)

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:11.927
But what it turned out to be,

00:04:11.951 --> 00:04:15.262
was that my staff was extremely upset

00:04:15.286 --> 00:04:21.488
because one of the wire services
in Nigeria had already written a story

00:04:21.512 --> 00:04:22.932
about my speech,

00:04:22.956 --> 00:04:24.932
and it had already been printed in cities

00:04:24.956 --> 00:04:27.288
all across the United States of America.

00:04:27.312 --> 00:04:29.140
It was printed in Monterey, I checked.

00:04:29.164 --> 00:04:30.314
(Laughter)

00:04:30.553 --> 00:04:33.214
And the story began,

00:04:33.238 --> 00:04:37.531
"Former Vice President Al Gore
announced in Nigeria yesterday," quote:

00:04:37.555 --> 00:04:41.184
'My wife Tipper and I have opened
a low-cost family restaurant'" --

00:04:41.208 --> 00:04:42.850
(Laughter)

00:04:42.874 --> 00:04:44.222
"'named Shoney's,

00:04:44.246 --> 00:04:46.045
and we are running it ourselves.'"

00:04:46.069 --> 00:04:49.389
(Laughter)

00:04:49.413 --> 00:04:51.571
Before I could get back to U.S. soil,

00:04:51.595 --> 00:04:55.709
David Letterman and Jay Leno
had already started in on --

00:04:55.733 --> 00:04:58.976
one of them had me
in a big white chef's hat,

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.429
Tipper was saying,
"One more burger with fries!"

00:05:01.453 --> 00:05:02.500
(Laughter)

00:05:02.524 --> 00:05:03.806
Three days later,

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:06.569
I got a nice, long, handwritten letter

00:05:06.593 --> 00:05:10.014
from my friend and partner
and colleague Bill Clinton, saying,

00:05:10.038 --> 00:05:12.434
"Congratulations
on the new restaurant, Al!"

00:05:12.458 --> 00:05:19.131
(Laughter)

00:05:19.155 --> 00:05:22.292
We like to celebrate
each other's successes in life.

00:05:22.316 --> 00:05:27.713
(Laughter)

00:05:28.606 --> 00:05:31.153
I was going to talk
about information ecology.

00:05:31.177 --> 00:05:33.195
But I was thinking that,

00:05:33.219 --> 00:05:36.976
since I plan to make a lifelong habit
of coming back to TED,

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.693
that maybe I could talk
about that another time.

00:05:39.717 --> 00:05:41.117
(Applause)

00:05:41.141 --> 00:05:42.538
Chris Anderson: It's a deal!

00:05:42.562 --> 00:05:45.188
(Applause)

00:05:45.212 --> 00:05:49.730
Al Gore: I want to focus
on what many of you have said

00:05:49.754 --> 00:05:51.620
you would like me to elaborate on:

00:05:51.644 --> 00:05:55.461
What can you do about the climate crisis?

00:05:56.317 --> 00:05:59.656
I want to start with a couple of --

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:02.249
I'm going to show some new images,

00:06:02.273 --> 00:06:07.396
and I'm going to recapitulate
just four or five.

00:06:08.075 --> 00:06:09.647
Now, the slide show.

00:06:09.671 --> 00:06:12.976
I update the slide show
every time I give it.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:14.237
I add new images,

00:06:14.261 --> 00:06:17.166
because I learn more about it
every time I give it.

00:06:17.823 --> 00:06:19.774
It's like beach-combing, you know?

00:06:19.798 --> 00:06:22.976
Every time the tide comes in and out,
you find some more shells.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:28.983
Just in the last two days, we got
the new temperature records in January.

00:06:29.007 --> 00:06:32.017
This is just for
the United States of America.

00:06:32.041 --> 00:06:34.779
Historical average
for Januarys is 31 degrees;

00:06:34.803 --> 00:06:38.487
last month was 39.5 degrees.

00:06:38.932 --> 00:06:43.745
Now, I know that you wanted some more
bad news about the environment --

00:06:43.769 --> 00:06:44.937
I'm kidding.

00:06:45.404 --> 00:06:48.460
But these are the recapitulation slides,

00:06:48.484 --> 00:06:51.878
and then I'm going to go into new
material about what you can do.

00:06:51.902 --> 00:06:54.297
But I wanted to elaborate
on a couple of these.

00:06:54.321 --> 00:06:57.632
First of all, this is where
we're projected to go

00:06:57.656 --> 00:06:59.758
with the U.S. contribution
to global warming,

00:06:59.782 --> 00:07:01.566
under business as usual.

00:07:01.590 --> 00:07:06.976
Efficiency in end-use electricity
and end-use of all energy

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:08.624
is the low-hanging fruit.

00:07:08.648 --> 00:07:13.152
Efficiency and conservation --
it's not a cost; it's a profit.

00:07:13.176 --> 00:07:15.853
The sign is wrong.

00:07:15.877 --> 00:07:18.020
It's not negative; it's positive.

00:07:18.044 --> 00:07:20.884
These are investments
that pay for themselves.

00:07:20.908 --> 00:07:24.779
But they are also very effective
in deflecting our path.

00:07:25.620 --> 00:07:29.615
Cars and trucks -- I talked
about that in the slideshow,

00:07:29.639 --> 00:07:32.131
but I want you to put it in perspective.

00:07:32.893 --> 00:07:37.490
It's an easy, visible target of concern --

00:07:37.514 --> 00:07:38.976
and it should be --

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:43.679
but there is more global warming pollution
that comes from buildings

00:07:43.703 --> 00:07:45.425
than from cars and trucks.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.641
Cars and trucks are very significant,

00:07:48.665 --> 00:07:51.250
and we have the lowest
standards in the world.

00:07:51.274 --> 00:07:54.300
And so we should address that.
But it's part of the puzzle.

00:07:54.324 --> 00:07:59.685
Other transportation efficiency
is as important as cars and trucks.

00:07:59.709 --> 00:08:04.051
Renewables at the current levels
of technological efficiency

00:08:04.075 --> 00:08:05.822
can make this much difference.

00:08:05.846 --> 00:08:11.801
And with what Vinod, and John Doerr
and others, many of you here --

00:08:11.825 --> 00:08:14.392
there are a lot of people
directly involved in this --

00:08:14.416 --> 00:08:16.948
this wedge is going to grow
much more rapidly

00:08:16.972 --> 00:08:19.159
than the current projection shows it.

00:08:19.183 --> 00:08:24.923
Carbon Capture and Sequestration --
that's what CCS stands for --

00:08:24.947 --> 00:08:31.762
is likely to become the killer app
that will enable us

00:08:31.786 --> 00:08:38.197
to continue to use fossil fuels
in a way that is safe.

00:08:39.459 --> 00:08:40.795
Not quite there yet.

00:08:40.819 --> 00:08:43.985
OK. Now, what can you do?

00:08:46.495 --> 00:08:48.252
Reduce emissions in your home.

00:08:49.022 --> 00:08:53.220
Most of these expenditures
are also profitable.

00:08:54.007 --> 00:08:55.976
Insulation, better design.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.689
Buy green electricity where you can.

00:08:59.436 --> 00:09:03.246
I mentioned automobiles -- buy a hybrid.

00:09:03.270 --> 00:09:04.976
Use light rail.

00:09:05.505 --> 00:09:08.287
Figure out some of the other options
that are much better.

00:09:08.311 --> 00:09:09.476
It's important.

00:09:10.254 --> 00:09:11.973
Be a green consumer.

00:09:11.997 --> 00:09:14.976
You have choices with everything you buy,

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:18.607
between things that have a harsh effect,

00:09:18.631 --> 00:09:24.131
or a much less harsh effect
on the global climate crisis.

00:09:24.870 --> 00:09:26.702
Consider this:

00:09:26.726 --> 00:09:29.978
Make a decision to live
a carbon-neutral life.

00:09:30.663 --> 00:09:33.097
Those of you who are good at branding,

00:09:33.121 --> 00:09:35.593
I'd love to get your advice and help

00:09:35.617 --> 00:09:41.695
on how to say this in a way
that connects with the most people.

00:09:41.719 --> 00:09:43.700
It is easier than you think.

00:09:43.724 --> 00:09:45.040
It really is.

00:09:47.223 --> 00:09:50.618
A lot of us in here
have made that decision,

00:09:50.642 --> 00:09:52.776
and it is really pretty easy.

00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:58.727
It means reduce
your carbon dioxide emissions

00:09:58.751 --> 00:10:01.447
with the full range
of choices that you make,

00:10:01.471 --> 00:10:05.596
and then purchase or acquire offsets

00:10:05.620 --> 00:10:08.737
for the remainder that you have not
completely reduced.

00:10:08.761 --> 00:10:15.251
And what it means is elaborated
at climatecrisis.net.

00:10:15.755 --> 00:10:18.620
There is a carbon calculator.

00:10:19.501 --> 00:10:22.976
Participant Productions convened --

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.570
with my active involvement --

00:10:25.594 --> 00:10:28.411
the leading software writers in the world,

00:10:28.435 --> 00:10:31.738
on this arcane science
of carbon calculation,

00:10:31.762 --> 00:10:35.864
to construct a consumer-friendly
carbon calculator.

00:10:36.317 --> 00:10:42.526
You can very precisely calculate
what your CO2 emissions are,

00:10:42.550 --> 00:10:45.868
and then you will be given
options to reduce.

00:10:45.892 --> 00:10:49.089
And by the time the movie
comes out in May,

00:10:49.113 --> 00:10:50.976
this will be updated to 2.0,

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:54.434
and we will have click-through
purchases of offsets.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:58.222
Next, consider making
your business carbon-neutral.

00:10:58.246 --> 00:10:59.854
Again, some of us have done that,

00:10:59.878 --> 00:11:01.884
and it's not as hard as you think.

00:11:03.196 --> 00:11:07.386
Integrate climate solutions
into all of your innovations,

00:11:07.410 --> 00:11:09.323
whether you are from the technology,

00:11:09.347 --> 00:11:12.976
or entertainment, or design
and architecture community.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.043
Invest sustainably.

00:11:15.067 --> 00:11:16.756
Majora mentioned this.

00:11:17.248 --> 00:11:24.040
Listen, if you have invested money
with managers who you compensate

00:11:24.064 --> 00:11:26.781
on the basis of their annual performance,

00:11:26.805 --> 00:11:31.717
don't ever again complain
about quarterly report CEO management.

00:11:32.807 --> 00:11:35.363
Over time, people do
what you pay them to do.

00:11:36.736 --> 00:11:41.429
And if they judge how much
they're going to get paid

00:11:41.453 --> 00:11:44.753
on your capital that they've invested,

00:11:44.777 --> 00:11:46.720
based on the short-term returns,

00:11:46.744 --> 00:11:49.060
you're going to get short-term decisions.

00:11:50.999 --> 00:11:52.612
A lot more to be said about that.

00:11:52.636 --> 00:11:54.382
Become a catalyst of change.

00:11:54.406 --> 00:11:58.041
Teach others, learn about it,
talk about it.

00:11:59.263 --> 00:12:02.668
The movie is a movie version
of the slideshow

00:12:02.692 --> 00:12:05.611
I gave two nights ago,
except it's a lot more entertaining.

00:12:06.694 --> 00:12:08.841
And it comes out in May.

00:12:09.437 --> 00:12:13.398
Many of you here have the opportunity
to ensure that a lot of people see it.

00:12:15.106 --> 00:12:18.709
Consider sending somebody to Nashville.

00:12:19.390 --> 00:12:20.545
Pick well.

00:12:21.381 --> 00:12:25.827
And I am personally going to train people
to give this slideshow --

00:12:25.851 --> 00:12:30.606
re-purposed, with some
of the personal stories obviously replaced

00:12:30.630 --> 00:12:32.700
with a generic approach,

00:12:32.724 --> 00:12:35.423
and it's not just the slides,
it's what they mean.

00:12:35.447 --> 00:12:37.048
And it's how they link together.

00:12:37.072 --> 00:12:41.659
And so I'm going to be conducting
a course this summer

00:12:41.683 --> 00:12:45.518
for a group of people that are
nominated by different folks

00:12:45.542 --> 00:12:47.771
to come and then give it en masse,

00:12:47.795 --> 00:12:49.976
in communities all across the country,

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:54.665
and we're going to update the slideshow
for all of them every single week,

00:12:54.689 --> 00:12:57.720
to keep it right on the cutting edge.

00:12:57.744 --> 00:13:01.625
Working with Larry Lessig, it will be,
somewhere in that process,

00:13:01.649 --> 00:13:06.484
posted with tools
and limited-use copyrights,

00:13:06.508 --> 00:13:11.976
so that young people can remix it
and do it in their own way.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:15.146
(Applause)

00:13:15.170 --> 00:13:16.660
Where did anybody get the idea

00:13:16.684 --> 00:13:19.036
that you ought to stay
arm's length from politics?

00:13:19.060 --> 00:13:21.150
It doesn't mean
that if you're a Republican,

00:13:21.174 --> 00:13:23.498
that I'm trying to convince you
to be a Democrat.

00:13:23.935 --> 00:13:25.440
We need Republicans as well.

00:13:25.464 --> 00:13:27.473
This used to be a bipartisan issue,

00:13:27.497 --> 00:13:29.954
and I know that
in this group it really is.

00:13:29.978 --> 00:13:31.530
Become politically active.

00:13:31.554 --> 00:13:34.427
Make our democracy work the way
it's supposed to work.

00:13:34.753 --> 00:13:40.302
Support the idea of capping
carbon dioxide emissions --

00:13:40.326 --> 00:13:42.341
global warming pollution --
and trading it.

00:13:42.365 --> 00:13:46.976
Here's why: as long as the United States
is out of the world system,

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:48.668
it's not a closed system.

00:13:48.692 --> 00:13:52.739
Once it becomes a closed system,
with U.S. participation,

00:13:52.763 --> 00:13:54.986
then everybody
who's on a board of directors --

00:13:55.010 --> 00:13:57.999
how many people here
serve on the board of directors

00:13:58.023 --> 00:13:59.277
of a corporation?

00:14:00.415 --> 00:14:01.841
Once it's a closed system,

00:14:01.865 --> 00:14:08.102
you will have legal liability
if you do not urge your CEO

00:14:08.126 --> 00:14:12.253
to get the maximum income from reducing
and trading the carbon emissions

00:14:12.277 --> 00:14:13.586
that can be avoided.

00:14:13.610 --> 00:14:16.275
The market will work
to solve this problem --

00:14:18.949 --> 00:14:21.166
if we can accomplish this.

00:14:22.434 --> 00:14:25.819
Help with the mass persuasion campaign
that will start this spring.

00:14:25.843 --> 00:14:28.351
We have to change the minds
of the American people.

00:14:28.375 --> 00:14:31.134
Because presently, the politicians
do not have permission

00:14:31.158 --> 00:14:33.077
to do what needs to be done.

00:14:33.355 --> 00:14:38.809
And in our modern country, the role
of logic and reason no longer includes

00:14:38.833 --> 00:14:41.787
mediating between wealth and power
the way it once did.

00:14:41.811 --> 00:14:47.371
It's now repetition of short, hot-button,
30-second, 28-second television ads.

00:14:47.395 --> 00:14:49.253
We have to buy a lot of those ads.

00:14:50.221 --> 00:14:54.531
Let's re-brand global warming,
as many of you have suggested.

00:14:54.555 --> 00:14:57.424
I like "climate crisis"
instead of "climate collapse,"

00:14:57.448 --> 00:14:59.775
but again, those of you
who are good at branding,

00:14:59.799 --> 00:15:01.204
I need your help on this.

00:15:01.768 --> 00:15:05.868
Somebody said the test
we're facing now, a scientist told me,

00:15:05.892 --> 00:15:08.976
is whether the combination
of an opposable thumb

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:11.817
and a neocortex is a viable combination.

00:15:11.947 --> 00:15:13.446
(Laughter)

00:15:13.825 --> 00:15:15.382
That's really true.

00:15:18.160 --> 00:15:21.560
I said the other night,
and I'll repeat now:

00:15:21.584 --> 00:15:23.749
this is not a political issue.

00:15:23.773 --> 00:15:29.312
Again, the Republicans here --
this shouldn't be partisan.

00:15:29.336 --> 00:15:32.976
You have more influence
than some of us who are Democrats do.

00:15:33.421 --> 00:15:34.897
This is an opportunity.

00:15:34.921 --> 00:15:39.773
Not just this, but connected
to the ideas that are here,

00:15:39.797 --> 00:15:41.725
to bring more coherence to them.

00:15:42.495 --> 00:15:43.661
We are one.

00:15:44.065 --> 00:15:46.400
Thank you very much, I appreciate it.

00:15:46.424 --> 00:15:52.666
(Applause)
