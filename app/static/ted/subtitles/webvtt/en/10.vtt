00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.976
With all the legitimate concerns
about AIDS and avian flu --

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:04.976
and we'll hear about that from the

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:06.976
brilliant Dr. Brilliant later today --

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.334
I want to talk about the other
pandemic, which is

00:00:09.358 --> 00:00:11.976
cardiovascular disease,
diabetes, hypertension --

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.976
all of which are completely
preventable for at

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.976
least 95 percent of people

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.976
just by changing diet and lifestyle.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:18.976
And what's happening is that there's a

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.239
globalization of illness
occurring, that people

00:00:21.263 --> 00:00:23.976
are starting to eat like us,
and live like us, and

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.976
die like us. And
in one generation, for example,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.976
Asia's gone from having
one of the lowest rates of

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.143
heart disease and obesity
and diabetes to one

00:00:31.167 --> 00:00:33.976
of the highest. And in Africa,
cardiovascular disease

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.976
equals the HIV and AIDS deaths

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:37.976
in most countries.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:39.976
So there's a critical
window of opportunity we

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:41.976
have to make an important
difference that can

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.976
affect the lives of literally
millions of people,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.096
and practice preventive
medicine on a global

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:46.976
scale.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.191
Heart and blood vessel
diseases still kill more

00:00:49.215 --> 00:00:51.311
people -- not only in this
country, but also

00:00:51.335 --> 00:00:53.976
worldwide -- than everything
else combined, and yet

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.334
it's completely preventable
for almost everybody.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.976
It's not only preventable; it's actually

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.143
reversible. And for the last
almost 29 years,

00:01:01.167 --> 00:01:03.406
we've been able to show
that by simply changing

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:05.976
diet and lifestyle, using
these very high-tech,

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.334
expensive, state-of-the-art
measures to prove how

00:01:08.358 --> 00:01:10.976
powerful these very simple
and low-tech and low-cost

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.976
interventions can be like -- quantitative

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.048
arteriography,
before and after a year, and

00:01:15.072 --> 00:01:15.976
cardiac PET scans.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:17.976
We showed a few months
ago -- we published the

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.096
first study showing you
can actually stop or

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:22.263
reverse the progression
of prostate cancer by

00:01:22.287 --> 00:01:24.976
making changes in diet
and lifestyle, and 70 percent

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.976
regression in the tumor
growth, or inhibition of

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:30.976
the tumor growth, compared
to only nine percent in the

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:31.976
control group.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.096
And in the MRI and MR
spectroscopy here, the

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:36.096
prostate tumor activity
is shown in red -- you can

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:37.976
see it diminishing after a year.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.976
Now there is an epidemic
of obesity: two-thirds of

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.976
adults and 15 percent of kids.
What's really concerning

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.976
to me is that diabetes has
increased 70 percent in the

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.976
past 10 years, and this may be the first

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.976
generation in which our kids
live a shorter life

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.976
span than we do. That's pitiful, and it's

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:53.976
preventable.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.976
Now these are not election
returns, these are the

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.286
people -- the number
of the people who are obese

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:02.976
by state, beginning in '85,
'86, '87 -- these are

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.976
from the CDC website --
'88, '89, '90, '91 -- you

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.976
get a new category --
'92, '93, '94, '95, '96,

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.976
'97, '98, '99, 2000, 2001
-- it gets worse. We're

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.381
kind of devolving. (Laughter)

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.976
Now what can we do about this?
Well, you know, the

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:24.976
diet that we've found
that can reverse heart

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.976
disease and cancer is an Asian diet.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.976
But the people in Asia
are starting to eat like we

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.976
are, which is why they're
starting to get sick

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:30.976
like we are.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.976
So I've been working
with a lot of the big food

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.976
companies. They can make
it fun and sexy and hip

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.381
and crunchy and convenient
to eat healthier foods,

00:02:37.405 --> 00:02:39.976
like -- I chair the advisory
boards to McDonald's,

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.976
and PepsiCo, and ConAgra,
and Safeway, and soon

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.143
Del Monte, and they're
finding that it's good

00:02:44.167 --> 00:02:44.976
business.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:45.976
The salads that you see
at McDonald's came from

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.976
the work -- they're going
to have an Asian salad. At

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.976
Pepsi, two-thirds
of their revenue growth came

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.976
from their better foods.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.143
And so if we can do that,
then we can free up

00:02:53.167 --> 00:02:55.976
resources for buying drugs
that you really do need

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.976
for treating AIDS and HIV
and malaria and for

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.524
preventing avian flu. Thank you.
