WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
I have a doppelganger.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
(Laughter)

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Dr. Gero is a brilliant

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
but slightly mad scientist

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
in the "Dragonball Z: Android Saga."

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
If you look very carefully,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
you see that his skull has been replaced

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
with a transparent Plexiglas dome

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
so that the workings of his brain can be observed

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
and also controlled with light.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
That's exactly what I do --

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
optical mind control.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
(Laughter)

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
But in contrast to my evil twin

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
who lusts after world domination,

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
my motives are not sinister.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
I control the brain

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
in order to understand how it works.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
Now wait a minute, you may say,

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
how can you go straight to controlling the brain

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
without understanding it first?

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
Isn't that putting the cart before the horse?

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
Many neuroscientists agree with this view

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
and think that understanding will come

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
from more detailed observation and analysis.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000
They say, "If we could record the activity of our neurons,

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
we would understand the brain."

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
But think for a moment what that means.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
Even if we could measure

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
what every cell is doing at all times,

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
we would still have to make sense

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
of the recorded activity patterns,

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
and that's so difficult,

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
chances are we'll understand these patterns

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
just as little as the brains that produce them.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
Take a look at what brain activity might look like.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
In this simulation, each black dot

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
is one nerve cell.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
The dot is visible

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
whenever a cell fires an electrical impulse.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
There's 10,000 neurons here.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
So you're looking at roughly one percent

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
of the brain of a cockroach.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000
Your brains are about 100 million times

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
more complicated.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
Somewhere, in a pattern like this,

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
is you,

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
your perceptions,

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
your emotions, your memories,

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
your plans for the future.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
But we don't know where,

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
since we don't know how to read the pattern.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
We don't understand the code used by the brain.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
To make progress,

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
we need to break the code.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
But how?

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
An experienced code-breaker will tell you

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000
that in order to figure out what the symbols in a code mean,

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000
it's essential to be able to play with them,

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
to rearrange them at will.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
So in this situation too,

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
to decode the information

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
contained in patterns like this,

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
watching alone won't do.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000
We need to rearrange the pattern.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
In other words,

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
instead of recording the activity of neurons,

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
we need to control it.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
It's not essential that we can control

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
the activity of all neurons in the brain, just some.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
The more targeted our interventions, the better.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
And I'll show you in a moment

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000
how we can achieve the necessary precision.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000
And since I'm realistic, rather than grandiose,

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000
I don't claim that the ability to control the function of the nervous system

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000
will at once unravel all its mysteries.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000
But we'll certainly learn a lot.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
Now, I'm by no means

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
the first person to realize

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000
how powerful a tool intervention is.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
The history of attempts

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000
to tinker with the function of the nervous system

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000
is long and illustrious.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.000
It dates back at least 200 years,

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
to Galvani's famous experiments

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000
in the late 18th century and beyond.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.000
Galvani showed that a frog's legs twitched

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000
when he connected the lumbar nerve

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000
to a source of electrical current.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000
This experiment revealed the first, and perhaps most fundamental,

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000
nugget of the neural code:

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000
that information is written in the form

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.000
of electrical impulses.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000
Galvani's approach

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000
of probing the nervous system with electrodes

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
has remained state-of-the-art until today,

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000
despite a number of drawbacks.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000
Sticking wires into the brain is obviously rather crude.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000
It's hard to do in animals that run around,

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000
and there is a physical limit

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000
to the number of wires

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000
that can be inserted simultaneously.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000
So around the turn of the last century,

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000
I started to think,

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.000
"Wouldn't it be wonderful if one could take this logic

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000
and turn it upside down?"

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000
So instead of inserting a wire

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.000
into one spot of the brain,

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000
re-engineer the brain itself

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.000
so that some of its neural elements

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.000
become responsive to diffusely broadcast signals

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.000
such as a flash of light.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.000
Such an approach would literally, in a flash of light,

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.000
overcome many of the obstacles to discovery.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.000
First, it's clearly a non-invasive,

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.000
wireless form of communication.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000
And second, just as in a radio broadcast,

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000
you can communicate with many receivers at once.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000
You don't need to know where these receivers are,

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000
and it doesn't matter if these receivers move --

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.000
just think of the stereo in your car.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.000
It gets even better,

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.000
for it turns out that we can fabricate the receivers

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.000
out of materials that are encoded in DNA.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000
So each nerve cell

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000
with the right genetic makeup

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.000
will spontaneously produce a receiver

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.000
that allows us to control its function.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000
I hope you'll appreciate

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000
the beautiful simplicity

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000
of this concept.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000
There's no high-tech gizmos here,

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.000
just biology revealed through biology.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.000
Now let's take a look at these miraculous receivers up close.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.000
As we zoom in on one of these purple neurons,

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.000
we see that its outer membrane

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000
is studded with microscopic pores.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.000
Pores like these conduct electrical current

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000
and are responsible

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000
for all the communication in the nervous system.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.000
But these pores here are special.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000
They are coupled to light receptors

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.000
similar to the ones in your eyes.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000
Whenever a flash of light hits the receptor,

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.000
the pore opens, an electrical current is switched on,

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.000
and the neuron fires electrical impulses.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.000
Because the light-activated pore is encoded in DNA,

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.000
we can achieve incredible precision.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000
This is because,

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000
although each cell in our bodies

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.000
contains the same set of genes,

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.000
different mixes of genes get turned on and off

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.000
in different cells.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.000
You can exploit this to make sure

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000
that only some neurons

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.000
contain our light-activated pore and others don't.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000
So in this cartoon, the bluish white cell

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000
in the upper-left corner

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000
does not respond to light

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.000
because it lacks the light-activated pore.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.000
The approach works so well

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.000
that we can write purely artificial messages

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.000
directly to the brain.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000
In this example, each electrical impulse,

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.000
each deflection on the trace,

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.000
is caused by a brief pulse of light.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000
And the approach, of course, also works

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.000
in moving, behaving animals.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000
This is the first ever such experiment,

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.000
sort of the optical equivalent of Galvani's.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.000
It was done six or seven years ago

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:08.000
by my then graduate student, Susana Lima.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:11.000
Susana had engineered the fruit fly on the left

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:15.000
so that just two out of the 200,000 cells in its brain

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.000
expressed the light-activated pore.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.000
You're familiar with these cells

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.000
because they are the ones that frustrate you

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.000
when you try to swat the fly.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.000
They trained the escape reflex that makes the fly jump into the air

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.000
and fly away whenever you move your hand in position.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:34.000
And you can see here that the flash of light has exactly the same effect.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:37.000
The animal jumps, it spreads its wings, it vibrates them,

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.000
but it can't actually take off

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.000
because the fly is sandwiched between two glass plates.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.000
Now to make sure that this was no reaction of the fly

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.000
to a flash it could see,

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.000
Susana did a simple

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000
but brutally effective experiment.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:55.000
She cut the heads off of her flies.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:59.000
These headless bodies can live for about a day,

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.000
but they don't do much.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:04.000
They just stand around

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:07.000
and groom excessively.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:10.000
So it seems that the only trait that survives decapitation is vanity.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:13.000
(Laughter)

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.000
Anyway, as you'll see in a moment,

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:20.000
Susana was able to turn on the flight motor

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:23.000
of what's the equivalent of the spinal cord of these flies

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.000
and get some of the headless bodies

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:28.000
to actually take off and fly away.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.000
They didn't get very far, obviously.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.000
Since we took these first steps,

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:40.000
the field of optogenetics has exploded.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000
And there are now hundreds of labs

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.000
using these approaches.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000
And we've come a long way

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:49.000
since Galvani's and Susana's first successes

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000
in making animals twitch or jump.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:54.000
We can now actually interfere with their psychology

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.000
in rather profound ways,

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.000
as I'll show you in my last example,

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:01.000
which is directed at a familiar question.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:04.000
Life is a string of choices

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:07.000
creating a constant pressure to decide what to do next.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:11.000
We cope with this pressure by having brains,

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:14.000
and within our brains, decision-making centers

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:17.000
that I've called here the "Actor."

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:21.000
The Actor implements a policy that takes into account

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.000
the state of the environment

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:26.000
and the context in which we operate.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:29.000
Our actions change the environment, or context,

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:32.000
and these changes are then fed back into the decision loop.

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:36.000
Now to put some neurobiological meat

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.000
on this abstract model,

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.000
we constructed a simple one-dimensional world

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:43.000
for our favorite subject, fruit flies.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.000
Each chamber in these two vertical stacks

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.000
contains one fly.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:50.000
The left and the right halves of the chamber

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.000
are filled with two different odors,

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.000
and a security camera watches

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:57.000
as the flies pace up and down between them.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.000
Here's some such CCTV footage.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:02.000
Whenever a fly reaches the midpoint of the chamber

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.000
where the two odor streams meet,

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.000
it has to make a decision.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.000
It has to decide whether to turn around

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.000
and stay in the same odor,

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.000
or whether to cross the midline

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.000
and try something new.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:17.000
These decisions are clearly a reflection

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:20.000
of the Actor's policy.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:24.000
Now for an intelligent being like our fly,

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:27.000
this policy is not written in stone

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:30.000
but rather changes as the animal learns from experience.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.000
We can incorporate such an element

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:35.000
of adaptive intelligence into our model

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.000
by assuming that the fly's brain

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.000
contains not only an Actor,

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.000
but a different group of cells,

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:44.000
a "Critic," that provides a running commentary

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.000
on the Actor's choices.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:49.000
You can think of this nagging inner voice

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.000
as sort of the brain's equivalent

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:53.000
of the Catholic Church,

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:56.000
if you're an Austrian like me,

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:59.000
or the super-ego, if you're Freudian,

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.000
or your mother, if you're Jewish.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:05.000
(Laughter)

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:07.000
Now obviously,

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:10.000
the Critic is a key ingredient

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.000
in what makes us intelligent.

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.000
So we set out to identify

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.000
the cells in the fly's brain

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.000
that played the role of the Critic.

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:21.000
And the logic of our experiment was simple.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:24.000
We thought if we could use our optical remote control

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:27.000
to activate the cells of the Critic,

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:30.000
we should be able, artificially, to nag the Actor

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.000
into changing its policy.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.000
In other words,

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.000
the fly should learn from mistakes

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.000
that it thought it had made

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:41.000
but, in reality, it had not made.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:43.000
So we bred flies

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:46.000
whose brains were more or less randomly peppered

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.000
with cells that were light addressable.

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.000
And then we took these flies

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.000
and allowed them to make choices.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.000
And whenever they made one of the two choices,

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.000
chose one odor,

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.000
in this case the blue one over the orange one,

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.000
we switched on the lights.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:03.000
If the Critic was among the optically activated cells,

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:05.000
the result of this intervention

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:08.000
should be a change in policy.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.000
The fly should learn to avoid

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.000
the optically reinforced odor.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:15.000
Here's what happened in two instances:

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:18.000
We're comparing two strains of flies,

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.000
each of them having

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.000
about 100 light-addressable cells in their brains,

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:25.000
shown here in green on the left and on the right.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:28.000
What's common among these groups of cells

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:31.000
is that they all produce the neurotransmitter dopamine.

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:33.000
But the identities of the individual

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:35.000
dopamine-producing neurons

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:38.000
are clearly largely different on the left and on the right.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.000
Optically activating

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:42.000
these hundred or so cells

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:44.000
into two strains of flies

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:46.000
has dramatically different consequences.

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.000
If you look first at the behavior

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.000
of the fly on the right,

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:53.000
you can see that whenever it reaches the midpoint of the chamber

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.000
where the two odors meet,

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:58.000
it marches straight through, as it did before.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.000
Its behavior is completely unchanged.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:03.000
But the behavior of the fly on the left is very different.

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:06.000
Whenever it comes up to the midpoint,

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.000
it pauses,

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:10.000
it carefully scans the odor interface

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.000
as if it was sniffing out its environment,

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.000
and then it turns around.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:17.000
This means that the policy that the Actor implements

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:19.000
now includes an instruction to avoid the odor

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:22.000
that's in the right half of the chamber.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.000
This means that the Critic

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.000
must have spoken in that animal,

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:28.000
and that the Critic must be contained

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:31.000
among the dopamine-producing neurons on the left,

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:34.000
but not among the dopamine producing neurons on the right.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:37.000
Through many such experiments,

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:39.000
we were able to narrow down

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:41.000
the identity of the Critic

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:43.000
to just 12 cells.

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:46.000
These 12 cells, as shown here in green,

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.000
send the output to a brain structure

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.000
called the "mushroom body,"

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.000
which is shown here in gray.

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:54.000
We know from our formal model

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.000
that the brain structure

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:59.000
at the receiving end of the Critic's commentary is the Actor.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:01.000
So this anatomy suggests

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:04.000
that the mushroom bodies have something to do

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:06.000
with action choice.

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:08.000
Based on everything we know about the mushroom bodies,

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:10.000
this makes perfect sense.

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:12.000
In fact, it makes so much sense

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:15.000
that we can construct an electronic toy circuit

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:18.000
that simulates the behavior of the fly.

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:21.000
In this electronic toy circuit,

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:23.000
the mushroom body neurons are symbolized

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:26.000
by the vertical bank of blue LEDs

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:29.000
in the center of the board.

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:31.000
These LED's are wired to sensors

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:34.000
that detect the presence of odorous molecules in the air.

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:38.000
Each odor activates a different combination of sensors,

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:40.000
which in turn activates

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:43.000
a different odor detector in the mushroom body.

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:45.000
So the pilot in the cockpit of the fly,

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:47.000
the Actor,

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:49.000
can tell which odor is present

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:53.000
simply by looking at which of the blue LEDs lights up.

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:56.000
What the Actor does with this information

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:58.000
depends on its policy,

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:00.000
which is stored in the strengths of the connection,

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.000
between the odor detectors

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:04.000
and the motors

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:06.000
that power the fly's evasive actions.

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:09.000
If the connection is weak, the motors will stay off

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:12.000
and the fly will continue straight on its course.

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:15.000
If the connection is strong, the motors will turn on

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:18.000
and the fly will initiate a turn.

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.000
Now consider a situation

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:22.000
in which the motors stay off,

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:25.000
the fly continues on its path

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:27.000
and it suffers some painful consequence

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:29.000
such as getting zapped.

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:31.000
In a situation like this,

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:33.000
we would expect the Critic to speak up

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:35.000
and to tell the Actor

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:37.000
to change its policy.

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:40.000
We have created such a situation, artificially,

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:43.000
by turning on the critic with a flash of light.

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:46.000
That caused a strengthening of the connections

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:49.000
between the currently active odor detector

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:51.000
and the motors.

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:53.000
So the next time

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:56.000
the fly finds itself facing the same odor again,

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:59.000
the connection is strong enough to turn on the motors

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:02.000
and to trigger an evasive maneuver.

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:07.000
I don't know about you,

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:10.000
but I find it exhilarating to see

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:13.000
how vague psychological notions

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:15.000
evaporate and give rise

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:18.000
to a physical, mechanistic understanding of the mind,

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:21.000
even if it's the mind of the fly.

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:24.000
This is one piece of good news.

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:26.000
The other piece of good news,

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:28.000
for a scientist at least,

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:31.000
is that much remains to be discovered.

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:33.000
In the experiments I told you about,

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:36.000
we have lifted the identity of the Critic,

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:38.000
but we still have no idea

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:40.000
how the Critic does its job.

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:42.000
Come to think of it, knowing when you're wrong

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:45.000
without a teacher, or your mother, telling you,

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:47.000
is a very hard problem.

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:49.000
There are some ideas in computer science

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:51.000
and in artificial intelligence

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:53.000
as to how this might be done,

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:55.000
but we still haven't solved

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:57.000
a single example

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:00.000
of how intelligent behavior

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:02.000
springs from the physical interactions

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:04.000
in living matter.

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:07.000
I think we'll get there in the not too distant future.

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:09.000
Thank you.

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:13.000
(Applause)
