00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Well, there's lots to talk about,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
but I think I'm just going to play to start off.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:19.000
(Music)

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
♫ When I wake up ♫

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000
♫ in the morning ♫

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000
♫ I pour the coffee ♫

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000
♫ I read the paper ♫

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000
♫ And then I slowly ♫

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000
♫ and so softly ♫

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000
♫ do the dishes ♫

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.000
♫ So feed the fishes ♫

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.000
♫ You sing me happy birthday ♫

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000
♫ Like it's gonna be ♫

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.000
♫ your last day ♫

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.000
♫ here on Earth ♫

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:27.000
(Applause)

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000
All right.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.000
So, I wanted to do something special today.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.000
I want to debut a new song that I've been working on

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.000
in the last five or six months.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000
And there's few things more thrilling

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000
than playing a song

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.000
for the first time in front of an audience,

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.000
especially when it's half-finished.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000
(Laughter)

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000
I'm kind of hoping some conversations here

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.000
might help me finish it.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000
Because it gets into all sorts

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000
of crazy realms.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000
And so this is basically a song

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000
about loops,

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.000
but not the kind of loops that I make up here.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.000
They're feedback loops.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000
And in the audio world

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.000
that's when the microphone gets too close

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.000
to its sound source,

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.000
and then it gets in this self-destructive loop

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.000
that creates a very unpleasant sound.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000
And I'm going to demonstrate for you.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000
(Laughter)

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.000
I'm not going to hurt you. Don't worry.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.000
♫ This is a loop, feedback loop ♫

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:34.000
♫ This is a loop, feedback loop ♫

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000
♫ This is a loop, feedback loop ♫

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.000
♫ This is a loop, feedback loop ♫

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.000
♫ This is a loop, feedback loop ♫

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.000
♫ This is a loop, feedback loop ♫

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:49.000
♫ This is a -- (Feedback)

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:55.000
All right. I don't know if that was necessary to demonstrate --

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.000
(Laughter)

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.000
-- but my point is it's the sound of self-destruction.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000
And I've been thinking about

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:08.000
how that applies across a whole spectrum of realms,

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:11.000
from, say, the ecological, okay.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.000
There seems to be a rule in nature

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.000
that if you get too close to where you came from,

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.000
it gets ugly.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:22.000
So like, you can't feed cows their own brains

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.000
or you get mad cow disease,

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.000
and inbreeding and incest

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.000
and, let's see,

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000
what's the other one?

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000
Biological -- there's autoimmune diseases,

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.000
where the body attacks itself

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000
a little too overzealously

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.000
and destroys the host,

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.000
or the person.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:46.000
And then -- okay, this is where we get to the song --

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:49.000
kind of bridges the gap to the emotional.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:52.000
Because although I've used scientific terms

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000
in songs,

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.000
it's very difficult sometimes to make them lyrical.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.000
And there's some things

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:02.000
you just don't need to have in songs.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.000
So I'm trying to bridge this gap

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:08.000
between this idea and this melody.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:11.000
And so, I don't know if you've ever had this,

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:14.000
but when I close my eyes sometimes

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.000
and try to sleep,

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:19.000
I can't stop thinking about my own eyes.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.000
And it's like your eyes

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.000
start straining to see themselves.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.000
That's what it feels like to me.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.000
It's not pleasant.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.000
I'm sorry if I put that idea in your head.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000
(Laughter)

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.000
It's impossible, of course, for your eyes to see themselves,

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.000
but they seem to be trying.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.000
So that's getting a little more closer to a personal experience.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000
Or ears being able to hear themselves --

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.000
it's just impossible.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000
That's the thing.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:49.000
So, I've been working on this song

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:52.000
that mentions these things

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.000
and then also imagines

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.000
a person who's been so successful

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:59.000
at defending themselves from heartbreak

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:02.000
that they're left to do the deed themselves,

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000
if that's possible.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.000
And that's what the song is asking.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.000
All right.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.000
It doesn't have a name yet.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:22.000
(Music)

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:11.000
♫ Go ahead and congratulate yourself ♫

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:15.000
♫ Give yourself a hand, the hand is your hand ♫

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:18.000
♫ And the eye that eyes itself is your eye ♫

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:22.000
♫ And the ear that hears itself is near ♫

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:25.000
♫ 'Cause it's your ear, oh oh ♫

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:28.000
♫ You've done the impossible now ♫

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:31.000
♫ Took yourself apart ♫

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:35.000
♫ You made yourself invulnerable ♫

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:38.000
♫ No one can break your heart ♫

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:42.000
♫ So you wear it out ♫

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:46.000
♫ And you wring it out ♫

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:49.000
♫ And you wear it out ♫

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.000
♫ And you break it yourself ♫

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:54.000
♫ Breaking your own, break it yourself ♫

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:58.000
♫ Breaking your own, break it yourself ♫

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:01.000
♫ Breaking your own ♫

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:18.000
(Applause)

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.000
Thanks.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:25.000
(Applause)

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.000
All right.

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:30.000
It's kind of cool. Songwriters can sort of get away with murder.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:33.000
You can throw out crazy theories

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:36.000
and not have to back it up with data

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:39.000
or graphs or research.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:42.000
But, you know, I think reckless curiosity

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:45.000
would be what the world needs now,

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:47.000
just a little bit.

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:51.000
(Applause)

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.000
I'm going to finish up with a song of mine

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.000
called "Weather Systems."

00:12:55.000 --> 00:13:05.000
(Music)

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:15.000
♫ Quiet ♫

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:21.000
♫ Quiet down, she said ♫

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:24.000
♫ Speak into the back of his head ♫

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:28.000
♫ On the edge of the bed, I can see your blood flow ♫

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:32.000
♫ I can see your ♫

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:35.000
♫ cells grow ♫

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:42.000
♫ Hold still awhile ♫

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:45.000
♫ Don't spill the wine ♫

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:48.000
♫ I can see it all from here ♫

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.000
♫ I can see ♫

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.000
♫ oh, I ♫

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:55.000
♫ I can see ♫

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:02.000
♫ weather systems ♫

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:05.000
♫ of the world ♫

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:18.000
♫ Weather systems ♫

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:21.000
♫ of the world ♫

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:55.000
♫ Some things you say ♫

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:59.000
♫ are not for sale ♫

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:02.000
♫ I would hold it where ♫

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:06.000
♫ our free agents of some substance are ♫

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:11.000
♫ scared ♫

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:18.000
♫ Hold still a while ♫

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:21.000
♫ Don't spill the wine ♫

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:25.000
♫ I can see it all from here ♫

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:27.000
♫ I can see ♫

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:29.000
♫ oh, I ♫

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:32.000
♫ I can see ♫

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:40.000
♫ weather systems of the world ♫

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:31.000
♫ Weather systems ♫

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:37.000
♫ of the world ♫

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:43.000
Thanks.

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:58.000
(Applause)
