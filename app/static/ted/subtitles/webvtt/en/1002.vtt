00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.000
So this is a story

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
of a place that I now call home.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
It's a story of public education

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
and of rural communities

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
and of what design might do to improve both.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
So this is Bertie County,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
North Carolina, USA.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
To give you an idea of the "where:"

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
So here's North Carolina, and if we zoom in,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Bertie County is in the eastern part of the state.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
It's about two hours east

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
driving-time from Raleigh.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
And it's very flat. It's very swampy.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
It's mostly farmland.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
The entire county

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
is home to just 20,000 people, and they're very sparsely distributed.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
So there's only 27 people per square mile,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
which comes down to about 10 people

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
per square kilometer.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
Bertie County is kind of a prime example

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
in the demise of rural America.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
We've seen this story all over the country

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
and even in places beyond the American borders.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
We know the symptoms.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
It's the hollowing out of small towns.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
It's downtowns becoming ghost towns.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
The brain drain --

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
where all of the most educated and qualified leave and never come back.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
It's the dependence on farm subsidies

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
and under-performing schools

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
and higher poverty rates in rural areas

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
than in urban.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
And Bertie County is no exception to this.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
Perhaps the biggest thing it struggles with,

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
like many communities similar to it,

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
is that there's no

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
shared, collective investment

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
in the future of rural communities.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
Only 6.8 percent of all our philanthropic giving in the U.S. right now

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
benefits rural communities,

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
and yet 20 percent of our population lives there.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
So Bertie County is not only very rural; it's incredibly poor.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
It is the poorest county in the state.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
It has one in three of its children living in poverty,

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
and it's what is referred to as a "rural ghetto."

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
The economy is mostly agricultural.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
The biggest crops are cotton and tobacco,

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000
and we're very proud of our Bertie County peanut.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
The biggest employer is the Purdue chicken processing plant.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
The county seat is Windsor.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
This is like Times Square of Windsor that you're looking at right now.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
It's home to only 2,000 people,

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
and like a lot of other small towns

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
it has been hollowed out over the years.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
There are more buildings that are empty or in disrepair

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
than occupied and in use.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
You can count the number of restaurants in the county

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
on one hand --

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
Bunn's Barbecue being my absolute favorite.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
But in the whole county there is no coffee shop,

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
there's no Internet cafe,

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
there's no movie theater, there's no bookstore.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
There isn't even a Walmart.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
Racially, the county

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
is about 60 percent African-American,

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
but what happens in the public schools

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
is most of the privileged white kids

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
go to the private Lawrence Academy.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
So the public school students

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
are about 86 percent African-American.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
And this is a spread from the local newspaper of the recent graduating class,

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
and you can see the difference is pretty stark.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
So to say that the public education system

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
in Bertie County is struggling

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
would be a huge understatement.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
There's basically no pool

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
of qualified teachers to pull from,

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
and only eight percent of the people in the county

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
have a bachelor's degree or higher.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
So there isn't a big legacy

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000
in the pride of education.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000
In fact, two years ago,

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000
only 27 percent of all the third- through eighth-graders

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
were passing the state standard

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000
in both English and math.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000
So it sounds like I'm painting a really bleak picture of this place,

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000
but I promise there is good news.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000
The biggest asset, in my opinion,

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000
one of the biggest assets in Bertie County right now is this man:

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
This is Dr. Chip Zullinger,

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000
fondly known as Dr. Z.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000
He was brought in in October 2007

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
as the new superintendent

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000
to basically fix this broken school system.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000
And he previously was a superintendent

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000
in Charleston, South Carolina

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000
and then in Denver, Colorado.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000
He started some of the country's first charter schools

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.000
in the late '80s in the U.S.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000
And he is an absolute renegade and a visionary,

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.000
and he is the reason that I now live and work there.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000
So in February of 2009,

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.000
Dr. Zullinger invited us, Project H Design --

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000
which is a non-profit design firm that I founded --

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000
to come to Bertie and to partner with him

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
on the repair of this school district

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.000
and to bring a design perspective to the repair of the school district.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000
And he invited us in particular

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000
because we have a very specific

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000
type of design process --

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.000
one that results in appropriate design solutions

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000
in places that don't usually have access

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000
to design services or creative capital.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.000
Specifically, we use these six design directives,

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000
probably the most important being number two:

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.000
we design with, not for --

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.000
in that, when we're doing humanitarian-focused design,

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000
it's not about designing for clients anymore.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000
It's about designing with people,

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000
and letting appropriate solutions emerge from within.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000
So at the time of being invited down there,

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000
we were based in San Francisco,

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000
and so we were going back and forth

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000
for basically the rest of 2009,

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000
spending about half our time in Bertie County.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000
And when I say we, I mean Project H,

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.000
but more specifically, I mean myself and my partner, Matthew Miller,

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:55.000
who's an architect and a sort of MacGyver-type builder.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.000
So fast-forward to today, and we now live there.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000
I have strategically cut Matt's head out of this photo,

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000
because he would kill me if he knew I was using it

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000
because of the sweatsuits.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000
But this is our front porch. We live there.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000
We now call this place home.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.000
Over the course of this year that we spent flying back and forth,

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000
we realized we had fallen in love with the place.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.000
We had fallen in love with the place and the people

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000
and the work that we're able to do

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000
in a rural place like Bertie County,

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000
that, as designers and builders,

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000
you can't do everywhere.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000
There's space to experiment

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000
and to weld and to test things.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.000
We have an amazing advocate in Dr. Zullinger.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.000
There's a nobility of real, hands-on,

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000
dirt-under-your-fingernails work.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.000
But beyond our personal reasons for wanting to be there,

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000
there is a huge need.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.000
There is a total vacuum of creative capital in Bertie County.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.000
There isn't a single licensed architect in the whole county.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.000
And so we saw an opportunity

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.000
to bring design as this untouched tool,

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.000
something that Bertie County didn't otherwise have,

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000
and to be sort of the -- to usher that in

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.000
as a new type of tool in their tool kit.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000
The initial goal became using design

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.000
within the public education system in partnership with Dr. Zullinger --

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.000
that was why we were there.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000
But beyond that, we recognized

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000
that Bertie County, as a community,

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.000
was in dire need of a fresh perspective

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000
of pride and connectedness

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000
and of the creative capital

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.000
that they were so much lacking.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.000
So the goal became, yes, to apply design within education,

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000
but then to figure out how to make education

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.000
a great vehicle for community development.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000
So in order to do this, we've taken three different approaches

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.000
to the intersection of design and education.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.000
And I should say that these are three things that we've done in Bertie County,

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.000
but I feel pretty confident that they could work

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000
in a lot of other rural communities

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.000
around the U.S. and maybe even beyond.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.000
So the first of the three is design for education.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.000
This is the most kind of direct, obvious

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.000
intersection of the two things.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.000
It's the physical construction

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:55.000
of improved spaces and materials and experiences

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.000
for teachers and students.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.000
This is in response to the awful mobile trailers

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000
and the outdated textbooks

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.000
and the terrible materials that we're building schools out of these days.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.000
And so this played out for us in a couple different ways.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:11.000
The first was a series of renovations of computer labs.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.000
So traditionally, the computer labs,

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:16.000
particularly in an under-performing school like Bertie County,

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:19.000
where they have to benchmark test every other week,

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.000
the computer lab is a kill-and-drill

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.000
testing facility.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:26.000
You come in, you face the wall, you take your test and you leave.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.000
So we wanted to change the way that students approach technology,

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:32.000
to create a more convivial and social space

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.000
that was more engaging, more accessible,

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000
and also to increase the ability for teachers

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.000
to use these spaces for technology-based instruction.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.000
So this is the lab at the high school,

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.000
and the principal there is in love with this room.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:46.000
Every time he has visitors, it's the first place that he takes them.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.000
And this also meant the co-creation with some teachers

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.000
of this educational playground system

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.000
called the learning landscape.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:56.000
It allows elementary-level students to learn core subjects

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.000
through game play and activity

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000
and running around and screaming and being a kid.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000
So this game that the kids are playing here --

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000
in this case they were learning basic multiplication

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.000
through a game called Match Me.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:09.000
And in Match Me, you take the class, divide it into two teams,

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.000
one team on each side of the playground,

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.000
and the teacher will take a piece of chalk

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.000
and just write a number on each of the tires.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.000
And then she'll call out a math problem --

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.000
so let's say four times four --

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:22.000
and then one student from each team has to compete

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.000
to figure out that four times four is 16

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.000
and find the tire with the 16 on it and sit on it.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.000
So the goal is to have all of your teammates sitting on the tires

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000
and then your team wins.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.000
And the impact of the learning landscape

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.000
has been pretty surprising and amazing.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:38.000
Some of the classes and teachers have reported higher test scores,

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.000
a greater comfort level with the material,

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000
especially with the boys,

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.000
that in going outside and playing,

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000
they aren't afraid to take on

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.000
a double-digit multiplication problem --

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000
and also that the teachers are able

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.000
to use these as assessment tools

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.000
to better gauge how their students

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.000
are understanding new material.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:59.000
So with design for education, I think the most important thing

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:02.000
is to have a shared ownership of the solutions with the teachers,

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:05.000
so that they have the incentive and the desire to use them.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:08.000
So this is Mr. Perry. He's the assistant superintendent.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:11.000
He came out for one of our teacher-training days

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:14.000
and won like five rounds of Match Me in a row and was very proud of himself.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:17.000
(Laughter)

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:20.000
So the second approach is redesigning education itself.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.000
This is the most complex.

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.000
It's a systems-level look

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.000
at how education is administered

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.000
and what is being offered and to whom.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:31.000
So in many cases this is not so much about making change

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.000
as it is creating the conditions

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.000
under which change is possible

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.000
and the incentive to want to make change,

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:40.000
which is easier said than done in rural communities

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.000
and in inside-the-box education systems

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:44.000
in rural communities.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.000
So for us, this was a graphic public campaign

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.000
called Connect Bertie.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:52.000
There are thousands of these blue dots all over the county.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.000
And this was for a fund that the school district had

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:57.000
to put a desktop computer and a broadband Internet connection

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.000
in every home

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.000
with a child in the public school system.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.000
Right now I should say,

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.000
there are only 10 percent of the houses

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.000
that actually have an in-home Internet connection.

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.000
And the only places to get WiFi

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:12.000
are in the school buildings, or at the Bojangles Fried Chicken joint,

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:15.000
which I find myself squatting outside of a lot.

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:17.000
Aside from, you know, getting people excited

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:21.000
and wondering what the heck these blue dots were all over the place,

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.000
it asked the school system

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.000
to envision how it might become a catalyst

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.000
for a more connected community.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:30.000
It asked them to reach outside of the school walls

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.000
and to think about how they could play a role

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.000
in the community's development.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.000
So the first batch of computers

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.000
are being installed later this summer,

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:41.000
and we're helping Dr. Zullinger develop some strategies

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:44.000
around how we might connect the classroom and the home

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.000
to extend learning beyond the school day.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.000
And then the third approach, which is what I'm most excited about,

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.000
which is where we are now,

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.000
is: design as education.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:54.000
So "design as education" means

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:57.000
that we could actually teach design within public schools,

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.000
and not design-based learning --

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:02.000
not like "let's learn physics by building a rocket,"

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:05.000
but actually learning design-thinking

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:08.000
coupled with real construction and fabrication skills

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:11.000
put towards a local community purpose.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.000
It also means that designers are no longer consultants,

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.000
but we're teachers,

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.000
and we are charged with growing creative capital

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.000
within the next generation.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:22.000
And what design offers as an educational framework

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.000
is an antidote

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.000
to all of the boring, rigid, verbal instruction

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.000
that so many of these school districts are plagued by.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.000
It's hands-on, it's in-your-face,

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.000
it requires an active engagement,

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:35.000
and it allows kids to apply all the core subject learning

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:37.000
in real ways.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.000
So we started thinking

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.000
about the legacy of shop class

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:44.000
and how shop class -- wood and metal shop class in particular --

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:46.000
historically, has been something

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.000
intended for kids who aren't going to go to college.

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.000
It's a vocational training path.

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.000
It's working-class; it's blue-collar.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.000
The projects are things like,

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:57.000
let's make a birdhouse for your mom for Christmas.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.000
And in recent decades, a lot of the funding for shop class

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.000
has gone away entirely.

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:04.000
So we thought, what if you could bring back shop class,

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.000
but this time orient the projects

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:09.000
around things that the community needed,

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:11.000
and to infuse shop class

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:14.000
with a more critical and creative-design-thinking studio process.

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.000
So we took this kind of nebulous idea

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:19.000
and have worked really closely with Dr. Zullinger for the past year

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:22.000
on writing this as a one-year curriculum

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:24.000
offered at the high school level to the junior class.

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:26.000
And so this starts in four weeks,

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.000
at the end of the summer,

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.000
and my partner and I, Matthew and I,

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:33.000
just went through the arduous and totally convoluted process

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:35.000
of getting certified as high school teachers to actually run it.

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:37.000
And this is what it looks like.

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.000
So over the course of two semesters,

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:41.000
the Fall and the Spring,

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.000
the students spend three hours a day every single day

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:45.000
in our 4,500 square foot

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:48.000
studio/shop space.

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:51.000
And during that time, they're doing everything

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.000
from going out and doing ethnographic research and doing the need-finding,

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.000
coming back into the studio,

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.000
doing the brainstorming and design visualization

00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:59.000
to come up with concepts that might work,

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.000
and then moving into the shop and actually testing them,

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:03.000
building them, prototyping them,

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:06.000
figuring out if they are going to work and refining that.

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:09.000
And then over the summer, they're offered a summer job.

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:11.000
They're paid as employees of Project H

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:13.000
to be the construction crew with us

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:15.000
to build these projects in the community.

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:18.000
So the first project, which will be built next summer,

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:22.000
is an open-air farmers' market downtown,

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:25.000
followed by bus shelters for the school bus system in the second year

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:28.000
and home improvements for the elderly in the third year.

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.000
So these are real visible projects

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.000
that hopefully the students can point to and say,

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.000
"I built that, and I'm proud of it."

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:36.000
So I want you to meet three of our students.

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.000
This is Ryan.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.000
She is 15 years old.

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:43.000
She loves agriculture and wants to be a high school teacher.

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:45.000
She wants to go to college, but she wants to come back to Bertie County,

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:48.000
because that's where her family is from, where she calls home,

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.000
and she feels very strongly about giving back

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:53.000
to this place that she's been fairly fortunate in.

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.000
So what Studio H might offer her

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.000
is a way to develop skills

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:59.000
so that she might give back in the most meaningful way.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:02.000
This is Eric. He plays for the football team.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:05.000
He is really into dirtbike racing,

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:07.000
and he wants to be an architect.

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:09.000
So for him, Studio H offers him

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:12.000
a way to develop the skills he will need as an architect,

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:15.000
everything from drafting to wood and metal construction

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:17.000
to how to do research for a client.

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:19.000
And then this is Anthony.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:22.000
He is 16 years old, loves hunting and fishing and being outside

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:24.000
and doing anything with his hands,

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.000
and so for him, Studio H means

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.000
that he can stay interested in his education

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.000
through that hands-on engagement.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.000
He's interested in forestry, but he isn't sure,

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.000
so if he ends up not going to college,

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:37.000
he will have developed some industry-relevant skills.

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.000
What design and building really offers to public education

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:41.000
is a different kind of classroom.

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:43.000
So this building downtown,

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:46.000
which may very well become the site of our future farmers' market,

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.000
is now the classroom.

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:50.000
And going out into the community and interviewing your neighbors

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:52.000
about what kind of food they buy

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:54.000
and from where and why --

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:56.000
that's a homework assignment.

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:59.000
And the ribbon-cutting ceremony at the end of the summer

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:01.000
when they have built the farmers' market and it's open to the public --

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.000
that's the final exam.

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:06.000
And for the community, what design and building offers

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:08.000
is real, visible, built progress.

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:10.000
It's one project per year,

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:12.000
and it makes the youth the biggest asset

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:14.000
and the biggest untapped resource

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:17.000
in imagining a new future.

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:20.000
So we recognize that Studio H, especially in its first year,

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:22.000
is a small story --

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:25.000
13 students, it's two teachers,

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:27.000
it's one project in one place.

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:29.000
But we feel like this could work in other places.

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:32.000
And I really, strongly believe in the power of the small story,

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:34.000
because it is so difficult

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:37.000
to do humanitarian work at a global scale.

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:39.000
Because, when you zoom out that far,

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:42.000
you lose the ability to view people as humans.

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:45.000
Ultimately, design itself is a process

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:47.000
of constant education

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:49.000
for the people that we work with and for

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:51.000
and for us as designers.

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:54.000
And let's face it, designers, we need to reinvent ourselves.

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:57.000
We need to re-educate ourselves around the things that matter,

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:00.000
we need to work outside of our comfort zones more,

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:03.000
and we need to be better citizens in our own backyard.

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:05.000
So while this is a very small story,

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:08.000
we hope that it represents a step in the right direction

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:10.000
for the future of rural communities

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:12.000
and for the future of public education

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:14.000
and hopefully also for the future of design.

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:16.000
Thank you.

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:22.000
(Applause)
