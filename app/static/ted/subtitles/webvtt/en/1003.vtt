00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Today I want to talk to you

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
about ethnic conflict

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
and civil war.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
These are not normally the most cheerful of topics,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
nor do they generally generate

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
the kind of good news

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
that this conference is about.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Yet, not only is there at least some good news

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
to be told about fewer such conflicts now

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
than two decades ago,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
but what is perhaps more important

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
is that we also have come

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
to a much better understanding of what can be done

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
to further reduce the number

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
of ethnic conflicts and civil wars

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
and the suffering that they inflict.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
Three things stand out:

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
leadership, diplomacy

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
and institutional design.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
What I will focus on in my talk

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
is why they matter, how they matter,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
and what we can all do

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
to make sure that they continue to matter

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
in the right ways,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
that is, how all of us can contribute

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
to developing and honing the skills

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
of local and global leaders

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
to make peace

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
and to make it last.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
But let's start at the beginning.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
Civil wars have made news headlines

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
for many decades now,

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
and ethnic conflicts in particular

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
have been a near constant presence

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
as a major international security threat.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
For nearly two decades now,

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
the news has been bad

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
and the images have been haunting.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
In Georgia, after years of stalemate,

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
we saw a full-scale resurgence of violence

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
in August, 2008.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
This quickly escalated into a five-day war

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
between Russia and Georgia,

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
leaving Georgia ever more divided.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
In Kenya, contested presidential elections in 2007 --

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
we just heard about them --

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
quickly led to high levels

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
of inter-ethnic violence

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
and the killing and displacement

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
of thousands of people.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
In Sri Lanka,

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
a decades-long civil war

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
between the Tamil minority

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
and the Sinhala majority

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
led to a bloody climax in 2009,

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
after perhaps as many as 100,000

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
people had been killed

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
since 1983.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
In Kyrgyzstan, just over the last few weeks,

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
unprecedented levels of violence occurred

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
between ethnic Kyrgyz

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
and ethnic Uzbeks.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
Hundreds have been killed,

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
and more than 100,000 displaced,

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
including many ethnic Uzbeks

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000
who fled to neighboring Uzbekistan.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
In the Middle East,

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000
conflict between Israelis and Palestinians

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
continues unabated,

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
and it becomes ever more difficult

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000
to see how, just how

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
a possible, sustainable solution

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000
can be achieved.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000
Darfur may have slipped from the news headlines,

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000
but the killing and displacement there

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000
continues as well,

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000
and the sheer human misery that it creates

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
is very hard to fathom.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000
And in Iraq, finally,

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000
violence is on the rise again,

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000
and the country has yet to form a government

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000
four months after

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000
its last parliamentary elections.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.000
But hang on, this talk is to be about the good news.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.000
So are these now the images of the past?

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000
Well, notwithstanding the gloomy pictures

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000
from the Middle East, Darfur,

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000
Iraq, elsewhere,

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000
there is a longer-term trend

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.000
that does represent some good news.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000
Over the past two decades, since the end of the Cold War,

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.000
there has been an overall decline

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000
in the number of civil wars.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.000
Since the high in the early 1990s,

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.000
with about 50 such civil wars ongoing,

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000
we now have 30 percent fewer

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
such conflicts today.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000
The number of people killed in civil wars

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.000
also is much lower today

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.000
than it was a decade ago or two.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.000
But this trend is less unambiguous.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.000
The highest level of deaths on the battlefield

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.000
was recorded between 1998 and 2001,

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.000
with about 80,000 soldiers, policemen and rebels

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000
killed every year.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000
The lowest number of combatant casualties

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.000
occurred in 2003,

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.000
with just 20,000 killed.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.000
Despite the up and down since then,

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000
the overall trend --

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000
and this is the important bit --

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000
clearly points downward

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.000
for the past two decades.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000
The news about civilian casualties

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000
is also less bad than it used to be.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000
From over 12,000 civilians

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
deliberately killed in civil wars

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.000
in 1997 and 1998,

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000
a decade later,

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000
this figure stands at 4,000.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000
This is a decrease by two-thirds.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000
This decline would be even more obvious

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000
if we factored in the genocide in Rwanda

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000
in 1994.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.000
But then 800,000 civilians were slaughtered

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.000
in a matter of just a few months.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000
This certainly is an accomplishment

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.000
that must never be surpassed.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000
What is also important is to note

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.000
that these figures only tell part of the story.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000
They exclude people

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000
that died as a consequence of civil war,

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000
from hunger or disease, for example.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.000
And they also do not properly account

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.000
for civilian suffering more generally.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.000
Torture, rape and ethnic cleansing

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.000
have become highly effective,

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.000
if often non-lethal, weapons in civil war.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.000
To put it differently,

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.000
for the civilians that suffer the consequences

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.000
of ethnic conflict and civil war,

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.000
there is no good war

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.000
and there is no bad peace.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.000
Thus, even though every civilian killed,

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.000
maimed, raped, or tortured is one too many,

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.000
the fact that the number

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.000
of civilian casualties

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.000
is clearly lower today

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000
than it was a decade ago,

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.000
is good news.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000
So, we have fewer conflicts today

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.000
in which fewer people get killed.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.000
And the big question, of course,

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000
is why?

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000
In some cases,

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000
there is a military victory of one side.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.000
This is a solution of sorts,

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.000
but rarely is it one

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.000
that comes without human costs

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:40.000
or humanitarian consequences.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:43.000
The defeat of the Tamil Tigers in Sri Lanka

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.000
is perhaps the most recent example of this,

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000
but we have seen similar

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.000
so-called military solutions

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.000
in the Balkans, in the South Caucasus

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:55.000
and across most of Africa.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.000
At times, they are complimented

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.000
by negotiated settlements,

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000
or at least cease-fire agreements,

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.000
and peacekeepers are deployed.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.000
But hardly ever do they represent

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.000
a resounding success --

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000
Bosnia and Herzegovina

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000
perhaps more so than Georgia.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.000
But for many parts of Africa,

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:16.000
a colleague of mine once put it this way,

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:19.000
"The cease-fire on Tuesday night

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.000
was reached just in time

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.000
for the genocide to start on Wednesday morning."

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.000
But let's look at the good news again.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000
If there's no solution on the battlefield,

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000
three factors can account

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:36.000
for the prevention of ethnic conflict and civil war,

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.000
or for sustainable peace afterwards:

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.000
leadership, diplomacy

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:44.000
and institutional design.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:47.000
Take the example of Northern Ireland.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.000
Despite centuries of animosity,

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.000
decades of violence

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:54.000
and thousands of people killed,

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.000
1998 saw the conclusion

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:59.000
of an historic agreement.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:02.000
Its initial version was skillfully mediated

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000
by Senator George Mitchell.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.000
Crucially, for the long-term success

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:09.000
of the peace process in Northern Ireland,

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.000
he imposed very clear conditions

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:14.000
for the participation and negotiations.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.000
Central among them,

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.000
a commitment

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:21.000
to exclusively peaceful means.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.000
Subsequent revisions of the agreement

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:26.000
were facilitated by the British and Irish governments,

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:29.000
who never wavered in their determination

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:32.000
to bring peace and stability to Northern Ireland.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.000
The core institutions

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.000
that were put in place in 1998

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.000
and their modifications

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.000
in 2006 and 2008

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000
were highly innovative

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.000
and allowed all conflict parties

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:48.000
to see their core concerns and demands addressed.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000
The agreement combines a power-sharing arrangement

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.000
in Northern Ireland

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.000
with cross-border institutions

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.000
that link Belfast and Dublin

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.000
and thus recognizes

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:02.000
the so-called Irish dimension of the conflict.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000
And significantly,

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.000
there's also a clear focus

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.000
on both the rights of individuals

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:11.000
and the rights of communities.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.000
The provisions in the agreement may be complex,

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:18.000
but so is the underlying conflict.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.000
Perhaps most importantly,

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:25.000
local leaders repeatedly rose to the challenge of compromise,

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.000
not always fast

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:30.000
and not always enthusiastically,

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.000
but rise in the end they did.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:35.000
Who ever could have imagined

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:38.000
Ian Paisley and Martin McGuinness

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.000
jointly governing Northern Ireland

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:43.000
as First and Deputy First Minister?

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:46.000
But then, is Northern Ireland a unique example,

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.000
or does this kind of explanation

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.000
only hold more generally

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:53.000
in democratic and developed countries?

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.000
By no means.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:58.000
The ending of Liberia's long-lasting civil war

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.000
in 2003

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.000
illustrates the importance

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.000
of leadership, diplomacy

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.000
and institutional design

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.000
as much as the successful prevention

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.000
of a full-scale civil war

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:13.000
in Macedonia in 2001,

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.000
or the successful ending

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:18.000
of the conflict in Aceh in Indonesia in 2005.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.000
In all three cases,

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.000
local leaders were willing and able

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.000
to make peace,

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:28.000
the international community stood ready

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:31.000
to help them negotiate and implement an agreement,

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:34.000
and the institutions have lived up

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.000
to the promise that they held

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.000
on the day they were agreed.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.000
Focusing on leadership, diplomacy

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.000
and institutional design

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:45.000
also helps explain failures to achieve peace,

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.000
or to make it last.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.000
The hopes that were vested in the Oslo Accords

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.000
did not lead to an end

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:53.000
of the Israeli/Palestinian conflict.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:56.000
Not all the issues that needed to be resolved

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.000
were actually covered in the agreements.

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:01.000
Rather, local leaders committed

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:04.000
to revisiting them later on.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:06.000
Yet instead of grasping this opportunity,

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.000
local and international leaders

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.000
soon disengaged

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.000
and became distracted

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:15.000
by the second Intifada, the events of 9/11

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:18.000
and the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.000
The comprehensive peace agreement for Sudan

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.000
signed in 2005

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:26.000
turned out to be less comprehensive than envisaged,

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:29.000
and its provisions may yet bear the seeds

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.000
of a full-scale return to war

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:33.000
between north and south.

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:36.000
Changes and shortcomings in leadership,

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:39.000
more off than on international diplomacy

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.000
and institutional failures

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:43.000
account for this

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.000
in almost equal measure.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:48.000
Unresolved boundary issues, squabbles over oil revenues,

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.000
the ongoing conflict in Darfur,

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:53.000
escalating tribal violence in the south

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.000
and generally weak state capacity

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:57.000
across all of Sudan

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:00.000
complete a very depressing picture

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.000
of the state of affairs

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.000
in Africa's largest country.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.000
A final example: Kosovo.

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.000
The failure to achieve

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.000
a negotiated solution for Kosovo

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.000
and the violence, tension

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:15.000
and de facto partition that resulted from it

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:17.000
have their reasons

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:20.000
in many, many different factors.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:23.000
Central among them are three.

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:26.000
First, the intransigence of local leaders

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.000
to settle for nothing less

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:31.000
than their maximum demands.

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:34.000
Second, an international diplomatic effort

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:37.000
that was hampered from the beginning

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:40.000
by Western support for Kosovo's independence.

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:44.000
And third, a lack of imagination

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:47.000
when it came to designing institutions

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:49.000
that could have addressed the concerns

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:52.000
of Serbs and Albanians alike.

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.000
By the same token --

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.000
and here we have some good news again --

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:59.000
the very fact that there is a high-level,

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.000
well-resourced international presence

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:03.000
in Kosovo

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:06.000
and the Balkans region more generally

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.000
and the fact that local leaders on both sides

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:10.000
have showed relative restraint,

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:13.000
explains why things have not been worse

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:16.000
over the past two years since 2008.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.000
So even in situations

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:21.000
where outcomes are less than optimal,

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.000
local leaders

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:26.000
and international leaders have a choice,

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:29.000
and they can make a difference for the better.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:31.000
A cold war

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.000
is not as good

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:35.000
as a cold peace,

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:37.000
but a cold peace

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:40.000
is still better than a hot war.

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:44.000
Good news is also about learning the right lesson.

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:46.000
So what then distinguishes

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.000
the Israeli/Palestinian conflict

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:51.000
from that in Northern Ireland,

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:53.000
or the civil war in Sudan

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.000
from that in Liberia?

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:58.000
Both successes and failures

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:01.000
teach us several critically important things

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:03.000
that we need to bear in mind

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:05.000
if we want the good news to continue.

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:08.000
First, leadership.

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:12.000
In the same way in which ethnic conflict and civil war

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:14.000
are not natural

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.000
but man-made disasters,

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.000
their prevention and settlement

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:21.000
does not happen automatically either.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:25.000
Leadership needs to be capable,

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:27.000
determined and visionary

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:29.000
in its commitment to peace.

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:32.000
Leaders need to connect to each other

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.000
and to their followers,

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:36.000
and they need to bring them along

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:39.000
on what is an often arduous journey

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:41.000
into a peaceful future.

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:44.000
Second, diplomacy.

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:47.000
Diplomacy needs to be well resourced,

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:49.000
sustained,

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:51.000
and apply the right mix of incentives and pressures

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:53.000
on leaders and followers.

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:56.000
It needs to help them reach an equitable compromise,

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:58.000
and it needs to ensure

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:00.000
that a broad coalition

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.000
of local, regional

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:04.000
and international supporters

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:07.000
help them implement their agreement.

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:10.000
Third, institutional design.

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:12.000
Institutional design requires

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:14.000
a keen focus on issues,

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:16.000
innovative thinking

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:19.000
and flexible and well-funded implementation.

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:23.000
Conflict parties need to move away

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:25.000
from maximum demands

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:27.000
and towards a compromise

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:30.000
that recognizes each other's needs.

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:32.000
And they need to think

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:34.000
about the substance of their agreement

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:36.000
much more than about

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:38.000
the labels they want to attach to them.

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:40.000
Conflict parties also need to be prepared

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:43.000
to return to the negotiation table

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:46.000
if the agreement implementation stalls.

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:49.000
For me personally,

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:52.000
the most critical lesson of all is this:

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:54.000
Local commitment to peace

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:56.000
is all-important,

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:59.000
but it is often not enough

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:02.000
to prevent or end violence.

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:05.000
Yet, no amount of diplomacy

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:07.000
or institutional design

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:10.000
can make up for local failures

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:13.000
and the consequences that they have.

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:16.000
Therefore, we must invest

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:19.000
in developing leaders,

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:22.000
leaders that have the skills,

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:24.000
vision and determination

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:26.000
to make peace.

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:28.000
Leaders, in other words,

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:30.000
that people will trust

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:33.000
and that they will want to follow

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:35.000
even if that means

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:38.000
making hard choices.

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:40.000
A final thought:

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:42.000
Ending civil wars

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:45.000
is a process that is fraught with dangers,

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:48.000
frustrations and setbacks.

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:51.000
It often takes a generation to accomplish,

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:54.000
but it also requires us, today's generation,

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:56.000
to take responsibility

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:58.000
and to learn the right lessons

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:01.000
about leadership, diplomacy

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:03.000
and institutional design,

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:07.000
so that the child soldiers of today

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:09.000
can become the children of tomorrow.

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:11.000
Thank you.

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:14.000
(Applause)
