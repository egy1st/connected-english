WEBVTT

00:00:00.754 --> 00:00:03.754
I'm here today to show
my photographs of the Lakota.

00:00:04.404 --> 00:00:06.555
Many of you may have heard of the Lakota,

00:00:06.579 --> 00:00:08.519
or at least the larger group of tribes,

00:00:08.543 --> 00:00:09.999
called the Sioux.

00:00:10.668 --> 00:00:13.803
The Lakota are one of many tribes
that were moved off their land

00:00:13.827 --> 00:00:15.232
to prisoner-of-war camps,

00:00:15.256 --> 00:00:16.778
now called reservations.

00:00:17.497 --> 00:00:19.584
The Pine Ridge Reservation,

00:00:19.608 --> 00:00:21.740
the subject of today's slide show,

00:00:21.764 --> 00:00:26.066
is located about 75 miles southeast
of the Black Hills in South Dakota.

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:31.017
It is sometimes referred to
as Prisoner of War Camp Number 334,

00:00:31.041 --> 00:00:33.167
and it is where the Lakota now live.

00:00:33.191 --> 00:00:35.377
Now, if any of you have ever heard of AIM,

00:00:35.401 --> 00:00:37.321
the American Indian Movement,

00:00:37.345 --> 00:00:39.187
or of Russell Means,

00:00:39.211 --> 00:00:40.623
or Leonard Peltier,

00:00:41.623 --> 00:00:43.710
or of the standoff at Oglala,

00:00:43.734 --> 00:00:47.871
then you know Pine Ridge is ground zero
for Native issues in the US.

00:00:49.257 --> 00:00:51.415
So I've been asked to talk
a little bit today

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:53.607
about my relationship with the Lakota,

00:00:53.631 --> 00:00:55.607
and that's a very difficult one for me,

00:00:55.631 --> 00:00:58.089
because, if you haven't
noticed from my skin color,

00:00:58.113 --> 00:00:59.502
I'm white,

00:00:59.526 --> 00:01:02.526
and that is a huge barrier
on a Native reservation.

00:01:04.113 --> 00:01:06.543
You'll see a lot of people
in my photographs today.

00:01:06.567 --> 00:01:09.884
I've become very close with them,
and they've welcomed me like family.

00:01:09.908 --> 00:01:11.826
They've called me "brother" and "uncle,"

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.154
and invited me again and again
over five years.

00:01:14.178 --> 00:01:15.376
But on Pine Ridge,

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:18.376
I will always be what is called "wasichu."

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:21.566
"Wasichu" is a Lakota word

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:23.691
that means "non-Indian,"

00:01:23.715 --> 00:01:25.794
but another version of this word

00:01:25.818 --> 00:01:29.038
means "the one who takes
the best meat for himself."

00:01:29.407 --> 00:01:31.228
And that's what I want to focus on --

00:01:31.252 --> 00:01:33.348
the one who takes
the best part of the meat.

00:01:33.853 --> 00:01:35.033
It means "greedy."

00:01:36.058 --> 00:01:38.154
So take a look around
this auditorium today.

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:41.930
We are at a private school
in the American West,

00:01:41.954 --> 00:01:44.376
sitting in red velvet chairs

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:45.812
with money in our pockets.

00:01:46.701 --> 00:01:48.447
And if we look at our lives,

00:01:48.471 --> 00:01:51.349
we have indeed taken
the best part of the meat.

00:01:52.336 --> 00:01:55.376
So let's look today
at a set of photographs

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:57.038
of a people who lost

00:01:57.062 --> 00:01:59.039
so that we could gain,

00:01:59.063 --> 00:02:01.569
and know that when you see
these people's faces,

00:02:02.304 --> 00:02:04.908
that these are not just
images of the Lakota;

00:02:04.932 --> 00:02:07.256
they stand for all indigenous people.

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:12.015
On this piece of paper

00:02:12.039 --> 00:02:15.752
is the history the way I learned it
from my Lakota friends and family.

00:02:17.623 --> 00:02:21.886
The following is a time line
of treaties made, treaties broken

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:24.192
and massacres disguised as battles.

00:02:24.668 --> 00:02:26.375
I'll begin in 1824.

00:02:26.901 --> 00:02:29.013
What is known as
the Bureau of Indian Affairs

00:02:29.037 --> 00:02:30.867
was created within the War Department,

00:02:30.891 --> 00:02:32.581
setting an early tone of aggression

00:02:32.605 --> 00:02:34.644
in our dealings with the Native Americans.

00:02:34.668 --> 00:02:36.211
1851:

00:02:36.235 --> 00:02:38.400
The first treaty of Fort Laramie was made,

00:02:38.424 --> 00:02:41.162
clearly marking the boundaries
of the Lakota Nation.

00:02:41.757 --> 00:02:44.836
According to the treaty,
those lands are a sovereign nation.

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:47.496
If the boundaries
of this treaty had held --

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:50.147
and there is a legal basis
that they should --

00:02:50.171 --> 00:02:52.926
then this is what the US
would look like today.

00:02:55.755 --> 00:02:56.926
Ten years later.

00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:00.042
The Homestead Act,
signed by President Lincoln,

00:03:00.066 --> 00:03:02.745
unleashed a flood of white settlers
into Native lands.

00:03:03.345 --> 00:03:05.024
1863:

00:03:05.048 --> 00:03:07.546
An uprising of Santee Sioux in Minnesota

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:10.478
ends with the hanging of 38 Sioux men,

00:03:10.502 --> 00:03:13.502
the largest mass execution in US history.

00:03:14.035 --> 00:03:16.274
The execution was ordered
by President Lincoln,

00:03:16.298 --> 00:03:20.993
only two days after he signed
the Emancipation Proclamation.

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:26.141
1866: The beginning
of the Transcontinental Railroad --

00:03:26.165 --> 00:03:27.376
a new era.

00:03:27.763 --> 00:03:29.953
We appropriated land for trails and trains

00:03:29.977 --> 00:03:32.376
to shortcut through the heart
of the Lakota Nation.

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:34.216
The treaties were out the window.

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:37.707
In response, three tribes led
by the Lakota chief Red Cloud

00:03:37.731 --> 00:03:39.437
attacked and defeated the US army,

00:03:39.461 --> 00:03:40.659
many times over.

00:03:40.683 --> 00:03:42.008
I want to repeat that part:

00:03:42.032 --> 00:03:44.064
The Lakota defeat the US army.

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:49.619
1868: The second Fort Laramie Treaty
clearly guarantees

00:03:49.643 --> 00:03:51.659
the sovereignty of the Great Sioux Nation

00:03:51.683 --> 00:03:54.500
and the Lakotas' ownership
of the sacred Black Hills.

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:57.284
The government also promises
land and hunting rights

00:03:57.308 --> 00:03:58.632
in the surrounding states.

00:03:58.656 --> 00:04:00.719
We promise that the Powder River country

00:04:00.743 --> 00:04:02.882
will henceforth be closed to all whites.

00:04:03.501 --> 00:04:05.559
The treaty seemed to be a complete victory

00:04:05.583 --> 00:04:07.043
for Red Cloud and the Sioux.

00:04:07.067 --> 00:04:09.979
In fact, this is the only war
in American history

00:04:10.812 --> 00:04:13.048
in which the government negotiated a peace

00:04:13.072 --> 00:04:15.743
by conceding everything
demanded by the enemy.

00:04:18.753 --> 00:04:22.495
1869: The Transcontinental
Railroad was completed.

00:04:22.519 --> 00:04:25.906
It began carrying, among other things,
large numbers of hunters,

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:28.276
who began the wholesale
killing of buffalo,

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:31.858
eliminating a source of food,
clothing and shelter for the Sioux.

00:04:31.882 --> 00:04:33.098
1871:

00:04:33.677 --> 00:04:35.337
The Indian Appropriation Act

00:04:35.361 --> 00:04:37.700
makes all Indians
wards of the federal government.

00:04:38.299 --> 00:04:40.450
In addition, the military issued orders

00:04:40.474 --> 00:04:43.338
forbidding western Indians
from leaving reservations.

00:04:44.154 --> 00:04:48.238
All western Indians at that point in time
were now prisoners of war.

00:04:48.903 --> 00:04:50.350
Also in 1871,

00:04:50.374 --> 00:04:52.351
we ended the time of treaty-making.

00:04:52.375 --> 00:04:56.067
The problem with treaties is they allow
tribes to exist as sovereign nations,

00:04:56.091 --> 00:04:57.261
and we can't have that.

00:04:57.285 --> 00:04:58.482
We had plans.

00:04:59.554 --> 00:05:00.777
1874:

00:05:00.801 --> 00:05:04.357
General George Custer announced
the discovery of gold in Lakota territory,

00:05:04.381 --> 00:05:06.066
specifically the Black Hills.

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:08.901
The news of gold creates
a massive influx of white settlers

00:05:08.925 --> 00:05:10.110
into Lakota Nation.

00:05:10.714 --> 00:05:12.747
Custer recommends that Congress find a way

00:05:12.771 --> 00:05:15.691
to end the treaties with the Lakota
as soon as possible.

00:05:16.048 --> 00:05:19.081
1875: The Lakota war begins

00:05:19.105 --> 00:05:21.757
over the violation
of the Fort Laramie Treaty.

00:05:22.551 --> 00:05:23.752
1876:

00:05:24.322 --> 00:05:25.980
On July 26th,

00:05:26.004 --> 00:05:28.223
on its way to attack a Lakota village,

00:05:28.247 --> 00:05:30.311
Custer's 7th Cavalry was crushed

00:05:30.335 --> 00:05:31.984
at the battle of Little Big Horn.

00:05:32.746 --> 00:05:33.942
1877:

00:05:34.585 --> 00:05:37.629
The great Lakota warrior
and chief named Crazy Horse

00:05:37.653 --> 00:05:39.376
surrendered at Fort Robinson.

00:05:39.843 --> 00:05:41.859
He was later killed while in custody.

00:05:45.935 --> 00:05:50.623
1877 is also the year we found a way
to get around the Fort Laramie Treaties.

00:05:50.647 --> 00:05:53.940
A new agreement was presented
to Sioux chiefs and their leading men,

00:05:53.964 --> 00:05:56.376
under a campaign known
as "Sell or Starve" --

00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:58.705
sign the paper, or no food for your tribe.

00:05:59.156 --> 00:06:01.872
Only 10 percent of the adult
male population signed.

00:06:02.586 --> 00:06:06.305
The Fort Laramie Treaty called
for at least three-quarters of the tribe

00:06:06.329 --> 00:06:07.488
to sign away land.

00:06:08.254 --> 00:06:10.082
That clause was obviously ignored.

00:06:10.709 --> 00:06:13.261
1887: The Dawes Act.

00:06:13.811 --> 00:06:16.376
Communal ownership
of reservation lands ends.

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:19.491
Reservations are cut up
into 160-acre sections,

00:06:19.515 --> 00:06:21.496
and distributed to individual Indians

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:23.376
with the surplus disposed of.

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:25.219
Tribes lost millions of acres.

00:06:26.322 --> 00:06:28.569
The American dream
of individual land ownership

00:06:28.593 --> 00:06:30.588
turned out to be a very clever way

00:06:30.612 --> 00:06:33.534
to divide the reservation
until nothing was left.

00:06:34.041 --> 00:06:35.887
The move destroyed the reservations,

00:06:35.911 --> 00:06:38.861
making it easier
to further subdivide and to sell

00:06:38.885 --> 00:06:40.806
with every passing generation.

00:06:41.155 --> 00:06:42.870
Most of the surplus land

00:06:42.894 --> 00:06:45.530
and many of the plots
within reservation boundaries

00:06:45.554 --> 00:06:47.520
are now in the hands of white ranchers.

00:06:48.034 --> 00:06:51.207
Once again, the fat of the land
goes to wasichu.

00:06:52.161 --> 00:06:56.787
1890: A date I believe to be
the most important in this slide show.

00:06:57.168 --> 00:06:59.591
This is the year
of the Wounded Knee Massacre.

00:07:00.237 --> 00:07:01.658
On December 29,

00:07:01.682 --> 00:07:04.864
US troops surrounded a Sioux
encampment at Wounded Knee Creek,

00:07:04.888 --> 00:07:08.937
and massacred Chief Big Foot
and 300 prisoners of war,

00:07:08.961 --> 00:07:12.463
using a new rapid-fire weapon
that fired exploding shells,

00:07:12.487 --> 00:07:13.645
called a Hotchkiss gun.

00:07:14.550 --> 00:07:16.130
For this so-called "battle,"

00:07:16.154 --> 00:07:19.157
20 Congressional Medals of Honor for Valor

00:07:19.181 --> 00:07:21.013
were given to the 7th Cavalry.

00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:23.703
To this day,

00:07:25.005 --> 00:07:29.113
this is the most Medals of Honor
ever awarded for a single battle.

00:07:30.019 --> 00:07:31.639
More Medals of Honor were given

00:07:31.663 --> 00:07:34.193
for the indiscriminate slaughter
of women and children

00:07:34.217 --> 00:07:37.089
than for any battle in World War One,

00:07:37.113 --> 00:07:38.454
World War Two,

00:07:38.478 --> 00:07:40.789
Korea, Vietnam,

00:07:40.813 --> 00:07:42.890
Iraq or Afghanistan.

00:07:44.811 --> 00:07:48.479
The Wounded Knee Massacre
is considered the end of the Indian wars.

00:07:49.842 --> 00:07:53.302
Whenever I visit the site
of the mass grave at Wounded Knee,

00:07:53.326 --> 00:07:57.728
I see it not just as a grave
for the Lakota or for the Sioux,

00:07:57.752 --> 00:08:00.143
but as a grave for all indigenous peoples.

00:08:03.230 --> 00:08:05.770
The holy man Black Elk, said,

00:08:05.794 --> 00:08:08.187
"I did not know then how much was ended.

00:08:09.737 --> 00:08:13.154
When I look back now
from this high hill of my old age,

00:08:13.178 --> 00:08:15.759
I can still see
the butchered women and children

00:08:15.783 --> 00:08:19.854
lying heaped and scattered
all along the crooked gulch,

00:08:23.751 --> 00:08:25.686
as plain as when I saw them

00:08:25.710 --> 00:08:27.147
with eyes still young.

00:08:31.002 --> 00:08:34.317
And I can see that something else
died there in the bloody mud

00:08:35.975 --> 00:08:37.671
and was buried in the blizzard.

00:08:39.383 --> 00:08:41.340
A people's dream died there.

00:08:42.523 --> 00:08:44.332
And it was a beautiful dream."

00:08:47.078 --> 00:08:48.534
With this event,

00:08:48.558 --> 00:08:51.558
a new era in Native American
history began.

00:08:52.400 --> 00:08:57.376
Everything can be measured
before Wounded Knee and after,

00:08:57.400 --> 00:08:59.167
because it was in this moment,

00:08:59.191 --> 00:09:02.478
with the fingers on the triggers
of the Hotchkiss guns,

00:09:02.502 --> 00:09:06.376
that the US government openly
declared its position on Native rights.

00:09:06.859 --> 00:09:08.376
They were tired of treaties.

00:09:08.795 --> 00:09:10.763
They were tired of sacred hills.

00:09:10.787 --> 00:09:12.620
They were tired of ghost dances.

00:09:13.676 --> 00:09:16.691
And they were tired of all
the inconveniences of the Sioux.

00:09:17.295 --> 00:09:18.930
So they brought out their cannons.

00:09:20.713 --> 00:09:23.040
"You want to be an Indian now?" they said,

00:09:23.064 --> 00:09:24.326
finger on the trigger.

00:09:30.556 --> 00:09:31.722
1900:

00:09:32.548 --> 00:09:36.018
the US Indian population
reached its low point --

00:09:36.042 --> 00:09:38.574
less than 250,000,

00:09:38.598 --> 00:09:42.400
compared to an estimated
eight million in 1492.

00:09:44.496 --> 00:09:45.679
Fast-forward.

00:09:46.400 --> 00:09:47.607
1980:

00:09:48.233 --> 00:09:50.932
The longest-running
court case in US history,

00:09:50.956 --> 00:09:53.537
the Sioux Nation versus the United States,

00:09:53.561 --> 00:09:56.227
was ruled upon by the US Supreme Court.

00:09:57.273 --> 00:10:00.796
The court determined that when the Sioux
were resettled onto reservations

00:10:00.820 --> 00:10:03.907
and seven million acres
of their land were opened up

00:10:03.931 --> 00:10:05.981
to prospectors and homesteaders,

00:10:06.005 --> 00:10:08.568
the terms of the second
Fort Laramie Treaty

00:10:08.592 --> 00:10:09.799
had been violated.

00:10:10.532 --> 00:10:14.272
The court stated that the Black Hills
were illegally taken,

00:10:14.296 --> 00:10:16.911
and that the initial
offering price, plus interest,

00:10:16.935 --> 00:10:18.729
should be paid to the Sioux Nation.

00:10:19.300 --> 00:10:20.852
As payment for the Black Hills,

00:10:20.876 --> 00:10:25.308
the court awarded only 106 million dollars
to the Sioux Nation.

00:10:25.332 --> 00:10:28.376
The Sioux refused the money
with the rallying cry,

00:10:28.400 --> 00:10:30.376
"The Black Hills are not for sale."

00:10:31.630 --> 00:10:32.789
2010:

00:10:33.329 --> 00:10:36.121
Statistics about Native population today,

00:10:36.145 --> 00:10:39.376
more than a century
after the massacre at Wounded Knee,

00:10:39.400 --> 00:10:41.985
reveal the legacy of colonization,

00:10:42.009 --> 00:10:43.277
forced migration

00:10:43.301 --> 00:10:44.744
and treaty violations.

00:10:45.895 --> 00:10:48.325
Unemployment on the Pine Ridge
Indian Reservation

00:10:48.349 --> 00:10:50.927
fluctuates between 85 and 90 percent.

00:10:51.689 --> 00:10:54.538
The housing office is unable
to build new structures,

00:10:54.562 --> 00:10:56.698
and existing structures are falling apart.

00:10:57.030 --> 00:10:58.199
Many are homeless,

00:10:58.223 --> 00:11:00.782
and those with homes
are packed into rotting buildings

00:11:00.806 --> 00:11:02.151
with up to five families.

00:11:02.598 --> 00:11:04.805
Thirty-nine percent of homes on Pine Ridge

00:11:04.829 --> 00:11:06.066
have no electricity.

00:11:06.524 --> 00:11:09.193
At least 60 percent
of the homes on the reservation

00:11:09.217 --> 00:11:11.034
are infested with black mold.

00:11:11.740 --> 00:11:16.005
More than 90 percent of the population
lives below the federal poverty line.

00:11:16.814 --> 00:11:18.974
The tuberculosis rate on Pine Ridge

00:11:18.998 --> 00:11:22.189
is approximately eight times higher
than the US national average.

00:11:22.615 --> 00:11:25.845
The infant mortality rate
is the highest on this continent,

00:11:25.869 --> 00:11:29.177
and is about three times higher
than the US national average.

00:11:29.201 --> 00:11:31.596
Cervical cancer is five times higher

00:11:31.620 --> 00:11:33.431
than the US national average.

00:11:33.455 --> 00:11:36.208
The school dropout rate
is up to 70 percent.

00:11:36.799 --> 00:11:40.904
Teacher turnover is eight times higher
than the US national average.

00:11:41.400 --> 00:11:44.769
Frequently, grandparents
are raising their grandchildren

00:11:44.793 --> 00:11:47.111
because parents, due to alcoholism,

00:11:47.135 --> 00:11:49.860
domestic violence and general apathy,

00:11:49.884 --> 00:11:51.082
cannot raise them.

00:11:52.082 --> 00:11:55.153
Fifty percent of the population
over the age of 40

00:11:55.177 --> 00:11:56.653
suffers from diabetes.

00:11:57.634 --> 00:12:03.503
The life expectancy for men
is between 46 and 48 years old --

00:12:04.265 --> 00:12:08.268
roughly the same
as in Afghanistan and Somalia.

00:12:10.138 --> 00:12:13.678
The last chapter
in any successful genocide

00:12:13.702 --> 00:12:15.679
is the one in which the oppressor

00:12:15.703 --> 00:12:18.243
can remove their hands and say,

00:12:18.267 --> 00:12:21.729
"My god -- what are these people
doing to themselves?

00:12:21.753 --> 00:12:23.449
They're killing each other.

00:12:23.473 --> 00:12:25.376
They're killing themselves

00:12:25.400 --> 00:12:27.049
while we watch them die."

00:12:28.241 --> 00:12:31.217
This is how we came to own
these United States.

00:12:31.700 --> 00:12:32.994
This is the legacy

00:12:33.019 --> 00:12:34.645
of Manifest Destiny.

00:12:35.453 --> 00:12:39.680
Prisoners are still born
into prisoner of war camps,

00:12:39.704 --> 00:12:41.666
long after the guards are gone.

00:12:44.449 --> 00:12:49.092
These are the bones
left after the best meat has been taken.

00:12:51.891 --> 00:12:53.209
A long time ago,

00:12:53.233 --> 00:12:55.210
a series of events was set in motion

00:12:55.234 --> 00:12:58.736
by a people who look like me, by wasichu,

00:12:58.760 --> 00:13:02.219
eager to take the land and the water
and the gold in the hills.

00:13:03.202 --> 00:13:06.286
Those events led to a domino effect
that has yet to end.

00:13:07.328 --> 00:13:10.767
As removed as we,
the dominant society, may feel

00:13:12.154 --> 00:13:14.747
from a massacre in 1890,

00:13:14.771 --> 00:13:18.497
or a series of broken
treaties 150 years ago,

00:13:18.971 --> 00:13:21.132
I still have to ask you the question:

00:13:22.084 --> 00:13:24.711
How should you feel
about the statistics of today?

00:13:25.878 --> 00:13:29.042
What is the connection
between these images of suffering

00:13:29.066 --> 00:13:31.042
and the history that I just read to you?

00:13:31.930 --> 00:13:34.780
And how much of this history
do you need to own, even?

00:13:35.479 --> 00:13:37.730
Is any of this your responsibility today?

00:13:39.273 --> 00:13:41.966
I have been told that there must be
something we can do.

00:13:41.990 --> 00:13:44.416
There must be some call to action.

00:13:45.697 --> 00:13:48.772
Because for so long,
I've been standing on the sidelines,

00:13:49.209 --> 00:13:50.835
content to be a witness,

00:13:50.859 --> 00:13:52.723
just taking photographs.

00:13:53.661 --> 00:13:56.260
Because the solutions
seem so far in the past,

00:13:56.284 --> 00:13:59.617
I needed nothing short
of a time machine to access them.

00:14:00.680 --> 00:14:05.788
The suffering of indigenous peoples
is not a simple issue to fix.

00:14:06.640 --> 00:14:08.656
It's not something everyone can get behind

00:14:08.680 --> 00:14:10.529
the way they get behind helping Haiti,

00:14:10.553 --> 00:14:12.956
or ending AIDS, or fighting a famine.

00:14:13.739 --> 00:14:15.705
The "fix," as it's called,

00:14:15.729 --> 00:14:18.376
may be much more difficult
for the dominant society

00:14:18.400 --> 00:14:20.697
than, say, a $50 check

00:14:20.721 --> 00:14:24.018
or a church trip to paint
some graffiti-covered houses,

00:14:24.042 --> 00:14:25.653
or a suburban family

00:14:25.677 --> 00:14:28.653
donating a box of clothes
they don't even want anymore.

00:14:29.296 --> 00:14:30.691
So where does that leave us?

00:14:31.176 --> 00:14:33.240
Shrugging our shoulders in the dark?

00:14:35.010 --> 00:14:39.690
The United States continues
on a daily basis to violate the terms

00:14:39.714 --> 00:14:44.163
of the 1851 and 1868
Fort Laramie Treaties with the Lakota.

00:14:44.723 --> 00:14:47.055
The call to action I offer today --

00:14:47.892 --> 00:14:49.941
my TED wish -- is this:

00:14:51.351 --> 00:14:52.632
Honor the treaties.

00:14:53.225 --> 00:14:54.922
Give back the Black Hills.

00:14:55.319 --> 00:14:57.561
It's not your business
what they do with them.

00:14:59.898 --> 00:15:06.777
(Applause)
