00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Do you ever feel completely overwhelmed

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
when you're faced with a complex problem?

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Well, I hope to change that in less than three minutes.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
So, I hope to convince you that complex

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
doesn't always equal complicated.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
So for me, a well-crafted baguette, fresh out of the oven,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
is complex,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
but a curry onion green olive poppy cheese bread

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
is complicated.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
I'm an ecologist, and I study complexity. I love complexity.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
And I study that in the natural world, the interconnectedness of species.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
So here's a food web,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
or a map of feeding links between species

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
that live in Alpine Lakes in the mountains of California.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
And this is what happens to that food web

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
when it's stocked with non-native fish that never lived there before.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
All the grayed-out species disappear.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
Some are actually on the brink of extinction.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
And lakes with fish have more mosquitos, even though they eat them.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
These effects were all unanticipated,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
and yet we're discovering they're predictable.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
So I want to share with you a couple key insights

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
about complexity we're learning from studying nature

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
that maybe are applicable to other problems.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
First is the simple power of good visualization tools

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
to help untangle complexity

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
and just encourage you to ask questions you didn't think of before.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
For example, you could plot the flow of carbon

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
through corporate supply chains in a corporate ecosystem,

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
or the interconnections of habitat patches

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
for endangered species in Yosemite National Park.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
The next thing is that if you want to predict

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
the effect of one species on another,

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
if you focus only on that link,

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
and then you black box the rest,

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
it's actually less predictable

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
than if you step back, consider the entire system -- all the species, all the links --

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
and from that place,

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
hone in on the sphere of influence that matters most.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
And we're discovering, with our research,

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
that's often very local to the node you care about

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
within one or two degrees.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
So the more you step back, embrace complexity,

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
the better chance you have of finding simple answers,

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
and it's often different than the simple answer that you started with.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
So let's switch gears and look at a really complex problem

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
courtesy of the U.S. government.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
This is a diagram of the U.S. counterinsurgency strategy in Afghanistan.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000
It was front page of the New York Times a couple months ago.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
Instantly ridiculed by the media

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
for being so crazy complicated.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
And the stated goal was to increase popular support

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
for the Afghan government.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
Clearly a complex problem,

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
but is it complicated?

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
Well, when I saw this in the front page of the Times,

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
I thought, "Great. Finally something I can relate to.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
I can sink my teeth into this."

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000
So let's do it. So here we go for the first time ever,

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000
a world premiere view of this spaghetti diagram as an ordered network.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
The circled node is the one we're trying to influence --

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
popular support for the government.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
And so now we can look one degrees, two degrees,

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
three degrees away from that node

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000
and eliminate three-quarters of the diagram outside that sphere of influence.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
Within that sphere,

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
most of those nodes are not actionable, like the harshness of the terrain,

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
and a very small minority are actual military actions.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
Most are non-violent and they fall into two broad categories:

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000
active engagement with ethnic rivalries and religious beliefs

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
and fair, transparent economic development

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
and provisioning of services.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000
I don't know about this, but this is what I can decipher from this diagram

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
in 24 seconds.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
When you see a diagram like this, I don't want you to be afraid.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
I want you to be excited. I want you to be relieved.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000
Because simple answers may emerge.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000
We're discovering in nature that simplicity often lies

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
on the other side of complexity.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000
So for any problem, the more you can zoom out and embrace complexity,

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
the better chance you have of zooming in

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
on the simple details that matter most.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000
Thank you.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000
(Applause)
