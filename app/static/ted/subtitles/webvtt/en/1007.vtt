00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
We've got a real problem with math education right now.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Basically, no one's very happy.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Those learning it

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
think it's disconnected,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
uninteresting and hard.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Those trying to employ them

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
think they don't know enough.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Governments realize that it's a big deal for our economies,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
but don't know how to fix it.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
And teachers are also frustrated.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Yet math is more important to the world

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
than at any point in human history.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
So at one end we've got falling interest

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
in education in math,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
and at the other end we've got a more mathematical world,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
a more quantitative world than we ever have had.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
So what's the problem, why has this chasm opened up,

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
and what can we do to fix it?

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
Well actually, I think the answer

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
is staring us right in the face:

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
Use computers.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
I believe

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
that correctly using computers

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
is the silver bullet

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
for making math education work.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
So to explain that,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
let me first talk a bit about what math looks like in the real world

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
and what it looks like in education.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
See, in the real world

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
math isn't necessarily done by mathematicians.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
It's done by geologists,

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
engineers, biologists,

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
all sorts of different people --

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
modeling and simulation.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
It's actually very popular.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
But in education it looks very different --

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
dumbed-down problems, lots of calculating,

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
mostly by hand.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
Lots of things that seem simple

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
and not difficult like in the real world,

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
except if you're learning it.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
And another thing about math:

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
math sometimes looks like math --

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
like in this example here --

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
and sometimes it doesn't --

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
like "Am I drunk?"

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
And then you get an answer that's quantitative in the modern world.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
You wouldn't have expected that a few years back.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
But now you can find out all about --

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
unfortunately, my weight is a little higher than that, but --

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
all about what happens.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
So let's zoom out a bit and ask,

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
why are we teaching people math?

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
What's the point of teaching people math?

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000
And in particular, why are we teaching them math in general?

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000
Why is it such an important part of education

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
as a sort of compulsory subject?

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
Well, I think there are about three reasons:

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
technical jobs

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
so critical to the development of our economies,

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
what I call "everyday living" --

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
to function in the world today,

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
you've got to be pretty quantitative,

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
much more so than a few years ago:

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
figure out your mortgages,

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000
being skeptical of government statistics, those kinds of things --

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000
and thirdly, what I would call something like

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
logical mind training, logical thinking.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
Over the years

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
we've put so much in society

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000
into being able to process and think logically. It's part of human society.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
It's very important to learn that

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
math is a great way to do that.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
So let's ask another question.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
What is math?

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
What do we mean when we say we're doing math,

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
or educating people to do math?

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000
Well, I think it's about four steps, roughly speaking,

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
starting with posing the right question.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000
What is it that we want to ask? What is it we're trying to find out here?

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000
And this is the thing most screwed up in the outside world,

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.000
beyond virtually any other part of doing math.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000
People ask the wrong question,

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
and surprisingly enough, they get the wrong answer,

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000
for that reason, if not for others.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
So the next thing is take that problem

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000
and turn it from a real world problem

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000
into a math problem.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000
That's stage two.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.000
Once you've done that, then there's the computation step.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000
Turn it from that into some answer

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000
in a mathematical form.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000
And of course, math is very powerful at doing that.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000
And then finally, turn it back to the real world.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000
Did it answer the question?

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000
And also verify it -- crucial step.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000
Now here's the crazy thing right now.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
In math education,

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.000
we're spending about perhaps 80 percent of the time

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.000
teaching people to do step three by hand.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000
Yet, that's the one step computers can do

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.000
better than any human after years of practice.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.000
Instead, we ought to be using computers

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000
to do step three

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000
and using the students to spend much more effort

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000
on learning how to do steps one, two and four --

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.000
conceptualizing problems, applying them,

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.000
getting the teacher to run them through how to do that.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
See, crucial point here:

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
math is not equal to calculating.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000
Math is a much broader subject than calculating.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000
Now it's understandable that this has all got intertwined

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000
over hundreds of years.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.000
There was only one way to do calculating and that was by hand.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000
But in the last few decades

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000
that has totally changed.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000
We've had the biggest transformation of any ancient subject

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.000
that I could ever imagine with computers.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000
Calculating was typically the limiting step,

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000
and now often it isn't.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000
So I think in terms of the fact that math

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.000
has been liberated from calculating.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.000
But that math liberation didn't get into education yet.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000
See, I think of calculating, in a sense,

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000
as the machinery of math.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000
It's the chore.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.000
It's the thing you'd like to avoid if you can, like to get a machine to do.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.000
It's a means to an end, not an end in itself,

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000
and automation allows us

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000
to have that machinery.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000
Computers allow us to do that --

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.000
and this is not a small problem by any means.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.000
I estimated that, just today, across the world,

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.000
we spent about 106 average world lifetimes

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.000
teaching people how to calculate by hand.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.000
That's an amazing amount of human endeavor.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000
So we better be damn sure --

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.000
and by the way, they didn't even have fun doing it, most of them --

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000
so we better be damn sure

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.000
that we know why we're doing that

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000
and it has a real purpose.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000
I think we should be assuming computers

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.000
for doing the calculating

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.000
and only doing hand calculations where it really makes sense to teach people that.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000
And I think there are some cases.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000
For example: mental arithmetic.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.000
I still do a lot of that, mainly for estimating.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000
People say, "Is such and such true?"

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.000
And I'll say, "Hmm, not sure." I'll think about it roughly.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.000
It's still quicker to do that and more practical.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.000
So I think practicality is one case

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000
where it's worth teaching people by hand.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000
And then there are certain conceptual things

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.000
that can also benefit from hand calculating,

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.000
but I think they're relatively small in number.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.000
One thing I often ask about

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.000
is ancient Greek and how this relates.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000
See, the thing we're doing right now

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000
is we're forcing people to learn mathematics.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000
It's a major subject.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.000
I'm not for one minute suggesting that, if people are interested in hand calculating

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.000
or in following their own interests

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000
in any subject however bizarre --

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.000
they should do that.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.000
That's absolutely the right thing,

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.000
for people to follow their self-interest.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000
I was somewhat interested in ancient Greek,

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.000
but I don't think that we should force the entire population

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.000
to learn a subject like ancient Greek.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000
I don't think it's warranted.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.000
So I have this distinction between what we're making people do

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.000
and the subject that's sort of mainstream

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.000
and the subject that, in a sense, people might follow with their own interest

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000
and perhaps even be spiked into doing that.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:07.000
So what are the issues people bring up with this?

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:10.000
Well one of them is, they say, you need to get the basics first.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.000
You shouldn't use the machine

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.000
until you get the basics of the subject.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.000
So my usual question is, what do you mean by "basics?"

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.000
Basics of what?

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.000
Are the basics of driving a car

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.000
learning how to service it, or design it for that matter?

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.000
Are the basics of writing learning how to sharpen a quill?

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000
I don't think so.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.000
I think you need to separate the basics of what you're trying to do

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.000
from how it gets done

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.000
and the machinery of how it gets done

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.000
and automation allows you to make that separation.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:45.000
A hundred years ago, it's certainly true that to drive a car

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.000
you kind of needed to know a lot about the mechanics of the car

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:50.000
and how the ignition timing worked and all sorts of things.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.000
But automation in cars

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.000
allowed that to separate,

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:58.000
so driving is now a quite separate subject, so to speak,

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:01.000
from engineering of the car

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:04.000
or learning how to service it.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.000
So automation allows this separation

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.000
and also allows -- in the case of driving,

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.000
and I believe also in the future case of maths --

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.000
a democratized way of doing that.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.000
It can be spread across a much larger number of people

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.000
who can really work with that.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.000
So there's another thing that comes up with basics.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.000
People confuse, in my view,

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:25.000
the order of the invention of the tools

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:28.000
with the order in which they should use them for teaching.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.000
So just because paper was invented before computers,

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:34.000
it doesn't necessarily mean you get more to the basics of the subject

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.000
by using paper instead of a computer

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.000
to teach mathematics.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:43.000
My daughter gave me a rather nice anecdote on this.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:46.000
She enjoys making what she calls "paper laptops."

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.000
(Laughter)

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000
So I asked her one day, "You know, when I was your age,

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.000
I didn't make these.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.000
Why do you think that was?"

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.000
And after a second or two, carefully reflecting,

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.000
she said, "No paper?"

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:03.000
(Laughter)

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.000
If you were born after computers and paper,

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:09.000
it doesn't really matter which order you're taught with them in,

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.000
you just want to have the best tool.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:14.000
So another one that comes up is "Computers dumb math down."

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.000
That somehow, if you use a computer,

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.000
it's all mindless button-pushing,

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.000
but if you do it by hand,

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.000
it's all intellectual.

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:25.000
This one kind of annoys me, I must say.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.000
Do we really believe

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.000
that the math that most people are doing in school

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.000
practically today

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.000
is more than applying procedures

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:36.000
to problems they don't really understand, for reasons they don't get?

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.000
I don't think so.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:41.000
And what's worse, what they're learning there isn't even practically useful anymore.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:44.000
Might have been 50 years ago, but it isn't anymore.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:47.000
When they're out of education, they do it on a computer.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:50.000
Just to be clear, I think computers can really help with this problem,

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.000
actually make it more conceptual.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.000
Now, of course, like any great tool,

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.000
they can be used completely mindlessly,

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:59.000
like turning everything into a multimedia show,

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:02.000
like the example I was shown of solving an equation by hand,

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.000
where the computer was the teacher --

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:07.000
show the student how to manipulate and solve it by hand.

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.000
This is just nuts.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:12.000
Why are we using computers to show a student how to solve a problem by hand

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.000
that the computer should be doing anyway?

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.000
All backwards.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.000
Let me show you

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:21.000
that you can also make problems harder to calculate.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.000
See, normally in school,

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:26.000
you do things like solve quadratic equations.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:29.000
But you see, when you're using a computer,

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:33.000
you can just substitute.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.000
You can make it a quartic equation. Make it kind of harder, calculating-wise.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.000
Same principles applied --

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.000
calculations, harder.

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.000
And problems in the real world

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.000
look nutty and horrible like this.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.000
They've got hair all over them.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:48.000
They're not just simple, dumbed-down things that we see in school math.

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.000
And think of the outside world.

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:53.000
Do we really believe that engineering and biology

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.000
and all of these other things

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.000
that have so benefited from computers and maths

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:00.000
have somehow conceptually gotten reduced by using computers?

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:03.000
I don't think so -- quite the opposite.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:06.000
So the problem we've really got in math education

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:09.000
is not that computers might dumb it down,

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:12.000
but that we have dumbed-down problems right now.

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.000
Well, another issue people bring up

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.000
is somehow that hand calculating procedures

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.000
teach understanding.

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.000
So if you go through lots of examples,

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.000
you can get the answer,

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:25.000
you can understand how the basics of the system work better.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:28.000
I think there is one thing that I think very valid here,

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:31.000
which is that I think understanding procedures and processes is important.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:35.000
But there's a fantastic way to do that in the modern world.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:38.000
It's called programming.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.000
Programming is how most procedures and processes

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:42.000
get written down these days,

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:44.000
and it's also a great way

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:46.000
to engage students much more

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.000
and to check they really understand.

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.000
If you really want to check you understand math

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:53.000
then write a program to do it.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:56.000
So programming is the way I think we should be doing that.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.000
So to be clear, what I really am suggesting here

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.000
is we have a unique opportunity

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.000
to make maths both more practical

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:05.000
and more conceptual, simultaneously.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:08.000
I can't think of any other subject where that's recently been possible.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.000
It's usually some kind of choice

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.000
between the vocational and the intellectual.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:15.000
But I think we can do both at the same time here.

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:20.000
And we open up so many more possibilities.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.000
You can do so many more problems.

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:24.000
What I really think we gain from this

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:27.000
is students getting intuition and experience

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:30.000
in far greater quantities than they've ever got before.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.000
And experience of harder problems --

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.000
being able to play with the math, interact with it,

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.000
feel it.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:39.000
We want people who can feel the math instinctively.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:42.000
That's what computers allow us to do.

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:45.000
Another thing it allows us to do is reorder the curriculum.

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:47.000
Traditionally it's been by how difficult it is to calculate,

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:49.000
but now we can reorder it

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:51.000
by how difficult it is to understand the concepts,

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.000
however hard the calculating.

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:56.000
So calculus has traditionally been taught very late.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.000
Why is this?

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:01.000
Well, it's damn hard doing the calculations, that's the problem.

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:04.000
But actually many of the concepts

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:07.000
are amenable to a much younger age group.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:10.000
This was an example I built for my daughter.

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.000
And very, very simple.

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:15.000
We were talking about what happens

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:17.000
when you increase the number of sides of a polygon

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:19.000
to a very large number.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.000
And of course, it turns into a circle.

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:25.000
And by the way, she was also very insistent

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:27.000
on being able to change the color,

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:30.000
an important feature for this demonstration.

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:34.000
You can see that this is a very early step

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:36.000
into limits and differential calculus

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:39.000
and what happens when you take things to an extreme --

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:41.000
and very small sides and a very large number of sides.

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:43.000
Very simple example.

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:45.000
That's a view of the world

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:48.000
that we don't usually give people for many, many years after this.

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:51.000
And yet, that's a really important practical view of the world.

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:54.000
So one of the roadblocks we have

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:57.000
in moving this agenda forward

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:59.000
is exams.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:02.000
In the end, if we test everyone by hand in exams,

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:05.000
it's kind of hard to get the curricula changed

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:07.000
to a point where they can use computers

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:10.000
during the semesters.

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:12.000
And one of the reasons it's so important --

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:15.000
so it's very important to get computers in exams.

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:18.000
And then we can ask questions, real questions,

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:21.000
questions like, what's the best life insurance policy to get? --

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:24.000
real questions that people have in their everyday lives.

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:27.000
And you see, this isn't some dumbed-down model here.

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:30.000
This is an actual model where we can be asked to optimize what happens.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.000
How many years of protection do I need?

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.000
What does that do to the payments

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:37.000
and to the interest rates and so forth?

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:40.000
Now I'm not for one minute suggesting it's the only kind of question

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.000
that should be asked in exams,

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:44.000
but I think it's a very important type

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:47.000
that right now just gets completely ignored

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:50.000
and is critical for people's real understanding.

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:53.000
So I believe [there is] critical reform

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:55.000
we have to do in computer-based math.

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:57.000
We have got to make sure

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:00.000
that we can move our economies forward,

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.000
and also our societies,

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:05.000
based on the idea that people can really feel mathematics.

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:10.000
This isn't some optional extra.

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:12.000
And the country that does this first

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:15.000
will, in my view, leapfrog others

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:18.000
in achieving a new economy even,

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.000
an improved economy,

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:22.000
an improved outlook.

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:24.000
In fact, I even talk about us moving

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:27.000
from what we often call now the "knowledge economy"

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:30.000
to what we might call a "computational knowledge economy,"

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:33.000
where high-level math is integral to what everyone does

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:35.000
in the way that knowledge currently is.

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:38.000
We can engage so many more students with this,

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:41.000
and they can have a better time doing it.

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:43.000
And let's understand:

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:46.000
this is not an incremental sort of change.

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:49.000
We're trying to cross the chasm here

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:51.000
between school math and the real-world math.

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:53.000
And you know if you walk across a chasm,

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:56.000
you end up making it worse than if you didn't start at all --

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:58.000
bigger disaster.

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:00.000
No, what I'm suggesting

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:02.000
is that we should leap off,

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:04.000
we should increase our velocity

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:06.000
so it's high,

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:09.000
and we should leap off one side and go the other --

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:12.000
of course, having calculated our differential equation very carefully.

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:14.000
(Laughter)

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:16.000
So I want to see

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:18.000
a completely renewed, changed math curriculum

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:20.000
built from the ground up,

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:22.000
based on computers being there,

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:24.000
computers that are now ubiquitous almost.

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:26.000
Calculating machines are everywhere

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:29.000
and will be completely everywhere in a small number of years.

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:33.000
Now I'm not even sure if we should brand the subject as math,

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:35.000
but what I am sure is

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:37.000
it's the mainstream subject of the future.

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:41.000
Let's go for it,

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:43.000
and while we're about it,

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:45.000
let's have a bit of fun,

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:48.000
for us, for the students and for TED here.

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:50.000
Thanks.

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:57.000
(Applause)
