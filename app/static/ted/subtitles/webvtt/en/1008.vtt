WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Delighted to be here

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
and to talk to you about a subject dear to my heart,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
which is beauty.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
I do the philosophy of art, aesthetics,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
actually, for a living.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
I try to figure out intellectually,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
philosophically, psychologically,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
what the experience of beauty is,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
what sensibly can be said about it

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
and how people go off the rails in trying to understand it.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Now this is an extremely complicated subject,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
in part because the things that we call beautiful

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
are so different.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
I mean just think of the sheer variety --

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
a baby's face,

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Berlioz's "Harold in Italy,"

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
movies like "The Wizard of Oz"

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
or the plays of Chekhov,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
a central California landscape,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
a Hokusai view of Mt. Fuji,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
"Der Rosenkavalier,"

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
a stunning match-winning goal

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
in a World Cup soccer match,

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
Van Gogh's "Starry Night,"

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
a Jane Austen novel,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
Fred Astaire dancing across the screen.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
This brief list includes human beings,

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
natural landforms,

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
works of art and skilled human actions.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
An account that explains the presence of beauty

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
in everything on this list

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
is not going to be easy.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
I can, however, give you at least a taste

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
of what I regard

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
as the most powerful theory of beauty

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
we yet have.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
And we get it not from a philosopher of art,

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
not from a postmodern art theorist

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
or a bigwig art critic.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
No, this theory

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
comes from an expert

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
on barnacles and worms and pigeon breeding,

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
and you know who I mean:

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
Charles Darwin.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
Of course, a lot of people think they already know

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
the proper answer to the question,

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
"What is beauty?"

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
It's in the eye of the beholder.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
It's whatever moves you personally.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
Or, as some people,

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
especially academics prefer,

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
beauty is in the culturally conditioned

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
eye of the beholder.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
People agree that paintings or movies or music

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
are beautiful

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.000
because their cultures determine a uniformity of aesthetic taste.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
Taste for both natural beauty and for the arts

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
travel across cultures

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
with great ease.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
Beethoven is adored in Japan.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
Peruvians love Japanese woodblock prints.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
Inca sculptures are regarded as treasures

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
in British museums,

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
while Shakespeare is translated

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
into every major language of the Earth.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
Or just think about American jazz

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
or American movies --

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
they go everywhere.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000
There are many differences among the arts,

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
but there are also universal,

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000
cross-cultural aesthetic pleasures

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
and values.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
How can we explain

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
this universality?

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
The best answer lies in trying to reconstruct

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000
a Darwinian evolutionary history

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000
of our artistic and aesthetic tastes.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
We need to reverse-engineer

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000
our present artistic tastes and preferences

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
and explain how they came

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000
to be engraved in our minds

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000
by the actions of both our prehistoric,

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000
largely pleistocene environments,

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000
where we became fully human,

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
but also by the social situations

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000
in which we evolved.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
This reverse engineering

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.000
can also enlist help

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000
from the human record

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000
preserved in prehistory.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.000
I mean fossils, cave paintings and so forth.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000
And it should take into account

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000
what we know of the aesthetic interests

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000
of isolated hunter-gatherer bands

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.000
that survived into the 19th and the 20th centuries.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000
Now, I personally

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000
have no doubt whatsoever

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000
that the experience of beauty,

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000
with its emotional intensity and pleasure,

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.000
belongs to our evolved human psychology.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.000
The experience of beauty is one component

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.000
in a whole series of Darwinian adaptations.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000
Beauty is an adaptive effect,

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000
which we extend

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000
and intensify

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000
in the creation and enjoyment

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.000
of works of art and entertainment.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000
As many of you will know,

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.000
evolution operates by two main primary mechanisms.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.000
The first of these is natural selection --

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.000
that's random mutation and selective retention --

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.000
along with our basic anatomy and physiology --

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.000
the evolution of the pancreas or the eye or the fingernails.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.000
Natural selection also explains

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000
many basic revulsions,

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000
such as the horrid smell of rotting meat,

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.000
or fears, such as the fear of snakes

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000
or standing close to the edge of a cliff.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000
Natural selection also explains pleasures --

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000
sexual pleasure,

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.000
our liking for sweet, fat and proteins,

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.000
which in turn explains a lot of popular foods,

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.000
from ripe fruits through chocolate malts

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.000
and barbecued ribs.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000
The other great principle of evolution

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000
is sexual selection,

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000
and it operates very differently.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.000
The peacock's magnificent tail

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.000
is the most famous example of this.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.000
It did not evolve for natural survival.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.000
In fact, it goes against natural survival.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000
No, the peacock's tail

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.000
results from the mating choices

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.000
made by peahens.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000
It's quite a familiar story.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.000
It's women who actually push history forward.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000
Darwin himself, by the way,

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000
had no doubts that the peacock's tail

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000
was beautiful in the eyes of the peahen.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.000
He actually used that word.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.000
Now, keeping these ideas firmly in mind,

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.000
we can say that the experience of beauty

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.000
is one of the ways that evolution has

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000
of arousing and sustaining

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.000
interest or fascination,

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000
even obsession,

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000
in order to encourage us

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.000
toward making the most adaptive decisions

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.000
for survival and reproduction.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.000
Beauty is nature's way

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.000
of acting at a distance,

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.000
so to speak.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.000
I mean, you can't expect to eat

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.000
an adaptively beneficial landscape.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000
It would hardly do to eat your baby

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000
or your lover.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000
So evolution's trick

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.000
is to make them beautiful,

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.000
to have them exert a kind of magnetism

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.000
to give you the pleasure of simply looking at them.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:43.000
Consider briefly an important source of aesthetic pleasure,

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.000
the magnetic pull

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000
of beautiful landscapes.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000
People in very different cultures

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000
all over the world

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.000
tend to like a particular kind of landscape,

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.000
a landscape that just happens to be similar

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.000
to the pleistocene savannas where we evolved.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000
This landscape shows up today

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.000
on calendars, on postcards,

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:08.000
in the design of golf courses and public parks

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.000
and in gold-framed pictures

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.000
that hang in living rooms

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.000
from New York to New Zealand.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.000
It's a kind of Hudson River school landscape

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.000
featuring open spaces

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.000
of low grasses

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:25.000
interspersed with copses of trees.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.000
The trees, by the way, are often preferred

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000
if they fork near the ground,

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:32.000
that is to say, if they're trees you could scramble up

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.000
if you were in a tight fix.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.000
The landscape shows the presence

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.000
of water directly in view,

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.000
or evidence of water in a bluish distance,

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:46.000
indications of animal or bird life

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.000
as well as diverse greenery

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:51.000
and finally -- get this --

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.000
a path

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.000
or a road,

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:58.000
perhaps a riverbank or a shoreline,

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:01.000
that extends into the distance,

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:04.000
almost inviting you to follow it.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:08.000
This landscape type is regarded as beautiful,

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.000
even by people in countries

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000
that don't have it.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.000
The ideal savanna landscape

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.000
is one of the clearest examples

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.000
where human beings everywhere

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.000
find beauty

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.000
in similar visual experience.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.000
But, someone might argue,

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000
that's natural beauty.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:29.000
How about artistic beauty?

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:32.000
Isn't that exhaustively cultural?

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.000
No, I don't think it is.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:37.000
And once again, I'd like to look back to prehistory

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.000
to say something about it.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.000
It is widely assumed

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.000
that the earliest human artworks

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:46.000
are the stupendously skillful cave paintings

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.000
that we all know from Lascaux

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000
and Chauvet.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.000
Chauvet caves

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.000
are about 32,000 years old,

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:58.000
along with a few small, realistic sculptures

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:01.000
of women and animals from the same period.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.000
But artistic and decorative skills

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:10.000
are actually much older than that.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.000
Beautiful shell necklaces

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:16.000
that look like something you'd see at an arts and crafts fair,

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.000
as well as ochre body paint,

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.000
have been found

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.000
from around 100,000 years ago.

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:25.000
But the most intriguing prehistoric artifacts

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.000
are older even than this.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.000
I have in mind

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:32.000
the so-called Acheulian hand axes.

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:36.000
The oldest stone tools are choppers

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.000
from the Olduvai Gorge in East Africa.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:41.000
They go back about two-and-a-half-million years.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.000
These crude tools

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:46.000
were around for thousands of centuries,

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:49.000
until around 1.4 million years ago

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.000
when Homo erectus

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.000
started shaping

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.000
single, thin stone blades,

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:58.000
sometimes rounded ovals,

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.000
but often in what are to our eyes

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.000
an arresting, symmetrical pointed leaf

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.000
or teardrop form.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.000
These Acheulian hand axes --

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.000
they're named after St. Acheul in France,

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:12.000
where finds were made in 19th century --

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:15.000
have been unearthed in their thousands,

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:18.000
scattered across Asia, Europe and Africa,

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:21.000
almost everywhere Homo erectus

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:24.000
and Homo ergaster roamed.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:27.000
Now, the sheer numbers of these hand axes

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.000
shows that they can't have been made

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.000
for butchering animals.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:34.000
And the plot really thickens when you realize

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:37.000
that, unlike other pleistocene tools,

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.000
the hand axes often exhibit

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.000
no evidence of wear

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.000
on their delicate blade edges.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.000
And some, in any event, are too big

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.000
to use for butchery.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.000
Their symmetry, their attractive materials

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.000
and, above all,

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:54.000
their meticulous workmanship

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:57.000
are simply quite beautiful

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:00.000
to our eyes, even today.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:03.000
So what were these ancient --

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:06.000
I mean, they're ancient, they're foreign,

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.000
but they're at the same time

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.000
somehow familiar.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:13.000
What were these artifacts for?

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.000
The best available answer

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.000
is that they were literally

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.000
the earliest known works of art,

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.000
practical tools transformed

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:24.000
into captivating aesthetic objects,

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.000
contemplated both for their elegant shape

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:29.000
and their virtuoso craftsmanship.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.000
Hand axes mark

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.000
an evolutionary advance in human history --

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.000
tools fashioned to function

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:39.000
as what Darwinians call "fitness signals" --

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.000
that is to say, displays

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:43.000
that are performances

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.000
like the peacock's tail,

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:48.000
except that, unlike hair and feathers,

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.000
the hand axes are consciously

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.000
cleverly crafted.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.000
Competently made hand axes

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:57.000
indicated desirable personal qualities --

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:01.000
intelligence, fine motor control,

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.000
planning ability,

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:05.000
conscientiousness

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:08.000
and sometimes access to rare materials.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:11.000
Over tens of thousands of generations,

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.000
such skills increased the status

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:15.000
of those who displayed them

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:17.000
and gained a reproductive advantage

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:19.000
over the less capable.

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:21.000
You know, it's an old line,

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:23.000
but it has been shown to work --

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:26.000
"Why don't you come up to my cave, so I can show you my hand axes?"

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.000
(Laughter)

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:31.000
Except, of course, what's interesting about this

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:34.000
is that we can't be sure how that idea was conveyed,

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.000
because the Homo erectus

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:39.000
that made these objects

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:41.000
did not have language.

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.000
It's hard to grasp,

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:46.000
but it's an incredible fact.

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.000
This object was made

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:51.000
by a hominid ancestor,

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:54.000
Homo erectus or Homo ergaster,

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:58.000
between 50,000 and 100,000 years

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.000
before language.

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:03.000
Stretching over a million years,

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:05.000
the hand axe tradition

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:08.000
is the longest artistic tradition

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:11.000
in human and proto-human history.

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:14.000
By the end of the hand axe epic, Homo sapiens --

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.000
as they were then called, finally --

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.000
were doubtless finding new ways

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:21.000
to amuse and amaze each other

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.000
by, who knows, telling jokes,

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:26.000
storytelling, dancing, or hairstyling.

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:29.000
Yes, hairstyling -- I insist on that.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:31.000
For us moderns,

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.000
virtuoso technique

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:35.000
is used to create imaginary worlds

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:37.000
in fiction and in movies,

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:39.000
to express intense emotions

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:42.000
with music, painting and dance.

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.000
But still,

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:46.000
one fundamental trait

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.000
of the ancestral personality persists

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:51.000
in our aesthetic cravings:

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:53.000
the beauty we find

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.000
in skilled performances.

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.000
From Lascaux to the Louvre

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:59.000
to Carnegie Hall,

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:01.000
human beings

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:03.000
have a permanent innate taste

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:06.000
for virtuoso displays in the arts.

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:09.000
We find beauty

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:11.000
in something done well.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:15.000
So the next time you pass a jewelry shop window

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:17.000
displaying a beautifully cut

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:19.000
teardrop-shaped stone,

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:21.000
don't be so sure

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:23.000
it's just your culture telling you

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:25.000
that that sparkling jewel is beautiful.

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:28.000
Your distant ancestors loved that shape

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:31.000
and found beauty in the skill needed to make it,

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:33.000
even before

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:35.000
they could put their love into words.

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:38.000
Is beauty in the eye of the beholder?

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:41.000
No, it's deep in our minds.

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:44.000
It's a gift handed down from the intelligent skills

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.000
and rich emotional lives

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:49.000
of our most ancient ancestors.

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:51.000
Our powerful reaction to images,

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:54.000
to the expression of emotion in art,

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:57.000
to the beauty of music, to the night sky,

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:00.000
will be with us and our descendants

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:03.000
for as long as the human race exists.

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:05.000
Thank you.

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:12.000
(Applause)
