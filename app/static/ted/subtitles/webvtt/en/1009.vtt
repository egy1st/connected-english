00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Mountain biking in Israel

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
is something that I do with great passion

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
and commitment.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
And when I'm on my bike,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
I feel that I connect

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
with the profound beauty of Israel,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
and I feel that I'm united

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
with this country's history

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
and biblical law.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
And also, for me,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
biking is a matter of empowerment.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
When I reach the summit

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
of a steep mountain in the middle of nowhere,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
I feel young,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
invincible, eternal.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
It's as if I'm connecting with some legacy

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
or with some energy

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
far greater than myself.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
You can see my fellow riders

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
at the end of the picture,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
looking at me with some concern.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
And here is another picture of them.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
Unfortunately, I cannot show their faces,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
neither can I disclose their true names,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
and that's because my fellow riders

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
are juvenile inmates,

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
offenders

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
spending time in a correction facility

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
about 20 minutes' ride from here --

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
well, like everything in Israel.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
And I've been riding with these kids once a week,

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
every Tuesday, rain or shine, for the last four years

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
and by now, they've become a very big part of my life.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
This story began four years ago.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
The correction facility where they are locked up

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
happens to be right in the middle

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
of one of my usual trips,

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
and it's surrounded by barbed wires

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
and electric gates and armed guards.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
So on one of these rides,

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
I talked my way into the compound

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
and went to see the warden.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
I told the warden

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
that I wanted to start a mountain biking club in this place

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
and that basically I wanted to take the kids

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000
from here to there.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
And I told him, "Let's find a way

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
in which I'll be able to take out 10 kids once a week

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
to ride with in the summer in the country."

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
And the warden was quite amused,

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
and he told me he thought that I was a nut

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
and he told me,

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
"This place is a correction facility. These guys are serious offenders.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
They are supposed to be locked up.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
They aren't supposed to be out at large."

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
And yet, we began to talk about it,

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
and one thing led to another.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000
And I can't see myself

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
going into a state prison in New Jersey

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
and making such a proposition,

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
but this being Israel,

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000
the warden somehow made it happen.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000
And so two months later,

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
we found ourselves "at large" --

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
myself,

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000
10 juvenile inmates

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
and a wonderful fellow named Russ,

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
who became a very good friend of mine

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
and my partner in this project.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000
And in the next few weeks, I had the tremendous pleasure

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000
of introducing these kids

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
to the world of total freedom,

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
a world consisting of magnificent vistas

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
like these --

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000
everything you see here is obviously in Israel --

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
as well as close encounters

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
with all sorts of small creatures

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
coming in all sorts of sizes,

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000
colors, shapes, forms

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000
and so on.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000
In spite of all this splendor,

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000
the beginning was extremely frustrating.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
Every small obstacle,

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000
every slight uphill,

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000
would cause these fellows

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.000
to stop in their tracks and give up.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.000
So we had a lot of this going on.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000
I found out that they had a very hard time

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000
dealing with frustration and difficulties --

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000
not because they were physically unfit.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.000
But that's one reason why they ended up where they were.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000
And I became increasingly more and more agitated,

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000
because I was there

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000
not only to be with them,

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000
but also to ride and create a team

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000
and I didn't know what to do.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000
Now, let me give you an example.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.000
We're going downhill in some rocky terrain,

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.000
and the front tire of Alex

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
gets caught in one of these crevasses here.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000
So he crashes down,

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000
and he gets slightly injured,

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.000
but this does not prevent him from jumping up

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000
and then starting to jump up and down on his bike

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000
and curse violently.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000
Then he throws his helmet in the air.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000
His backpack goes ballistic in some other direction.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000
And then he runs to the nearest tree

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.000
and starts to break branches and throw rocks

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.000
and curse like I've never heard.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.000
And I'm just standing there,

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000
watching this scene

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000
with a complete disbelief,

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000
not knowing what to do.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000
I'm used to algorithms

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.000
and data structures

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.000
and super motivated students,

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000
and nothing in my background

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000
prepared me to deal

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.000
with a raging, violent adolescent

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000
in the middle of nowhere.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000
And you have to realize that these incidents

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000
did not happen in convenient locations.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000
They happened in places like this,

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000
in the Judean Desert,

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.000
20 kilometers away from the nearest road.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000
And what you don't see in this picture

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.000
is that somewhere between these riders there,

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000
there's a teenager sitting on a rock,

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000
saying, "I'm not moving from here. Forget it.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000
I've had it."

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000
Well, that's a problem

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.000
because one way or another, you have to get this guy moving

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.000
because it's getting dark soon and dangerous.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.000
It took me several such incidents to figure out what I was supposed to do.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000
At the beginning, it was a disaster.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000
I tried harsh words and threats

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.000
and they took me nowhere.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.000
That's what they had all their lives.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.000
And at some point I found out,

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000
when a kid like this gets into a fit,

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000
the best thing that you can possibly do

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.000
is stay as close as possible to this kid,

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000
which is difficult,

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.000
because what you really want to do is go away.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000
But that's what he had all his life,

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000
people walking away from him.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.000
So what you have to do is stay close

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000
and try to reach in

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.000
and pet his shoulder

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000
or give him a piece of chocolate.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.000
So I would say, "Alex, I know that it's terribly difficult.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.000
Why don't you rest for a few minutes

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000
and then we'll go on."

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.000
"Go away you maniac-psychopath.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.000
Why would you bring us to this goddamn place?"

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.000
And I would say, "Relax, Alex.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000
Here's a piece of chocolate."

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000
And Alex would go, "Arrrrggg!"

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000
Because you have to understand

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000
that on these rides we are constantly hungry --

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.000
and after the rides also.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.000
And who is this guy, Alex, to begin with?

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.000
He's a 17-year-old.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.000
When he was eight,

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:40.000
someone put him on a boat in Odessa

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:43.000
and sent him, shipped him to Israel

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.000
on his own.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000
And he ended up in south Tel Aviv

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000
and did not have the good luck

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000
to be picked up by a [unclear]

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000
and roamed the streets

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.000
and became a prominent gang member.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.000
And he spent the last 10 years of his life

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000
in two places only,

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.000
the slums and the state prison,

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.000
where he spent the last two years

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:08.000
before he ended up sitting on this rock there.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.000
And so this kid

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.000
was probably abused,

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:16.000
abandoned, ignored, betrayed

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.000
by almost every adult along the way.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.000
So, for such a kid,

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:23.000
when an adult that he learns to respect stays close to him

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.000
and doesn't walk away from him

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.000
in any situation,

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.000
irrespective of how he behaves,

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.000
it's a tremendous healing experience.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:36.000
It's an act of unconditional acceptance,

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.000
something that he never had.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.000
I want to say a few words about vision.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.000
When I started this program four years ago,

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:46.000
I had this original plan

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.000
of creating a team

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.000
of winning underdogs.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:53.000
I had an image of Lance Armstrong

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.000
in my mind.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:58.000
And it took me exactly two months

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000
of complete frustration

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000
to realize that this vision

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000
was misplaced,

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.000
and that there was another vision

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.000
supremely more important

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:11.000
and more readily available.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:14.000
It all of a sudden dawned on me, in this project,

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.000
that the purpose of these rides

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.000
should actually be

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.000
to expose the kids

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:23.000
to one thing only: love.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.000
Love to the country, to the uphill

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.000
and the downhill,

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:30.000
to all the incredible creatures that surround us --

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000
the animals, the plants,

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.000
the insects --

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.000
love and respect

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.000
to other fellow members in your team,

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.000
in your biking team,

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000
and most importantly,

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.000
love and respect to yourself,

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000
which is something

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.000
that they badly miss.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000
Together with the kids,

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:53.000
I also went through a remarkable transformation.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.000
Now, I come from a cutthroat world

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.000
of science and high technology.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:00.000
I used to think that reason and logic

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000
and relentless drive

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000
were the only ways to make things happen.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.000
And before I worked with the kids,

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.000
anything that I did with them,

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.000
or anything that I did with myself,

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.000
was supposed to be perfect,

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.000
ideal, optimal,

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:19.000
but after working with them for some time,

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:22.000
I discovered the great virtues of empathy

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.000
and flexibility

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.000
and being able to start with some vision,

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:29.000
and if the vision doesn't work, well nothing happened.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:32.000
All you have to do is play with it, change it a little bit,

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:35.000
and come up with something that does help, that does work.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.000
So right now, I feel more

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.000
like these are my principles,

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.000
and if you don't like them,

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.000
I have others.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.000
(Laughter)

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:50.000
(Applause)

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.000
And one of these principles

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.000
is focus.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.000
Before each ride

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.000
we sit together with the kids,

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.000
and we give them one word

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.000
to think about during the ride.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:05.000
You have to focus their attention on something

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.000
because so many things happen.

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.000
So these are words like "teamwork"

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.000
or "endurance"

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.000
or even complicated concepts

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.000
like "resource allocation"

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:17.000
or "perspective," a word that they don't understand.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.000
You know, perspective

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.000
is one of these critically important

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.000
life-coping strategies

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:26.000
that mountain biking can really teach you.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.000
I tell kids

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:31.000
when they struggle through some uphill

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:33.000
and feel like they cannot take it anymore,

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:36.000
it really helps to ignore the immediate obstacles

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.000
and raise your head and look around

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.000
and see how the vista around you grows.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:43.000
It literally propels you upwards.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.000
That's what perspective is all about.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.000
Or you can also look back in time

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.000
and realize that you've already conquered

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:52.000
steeper mountains before.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:55.000
And that's how they develop self-esteem.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.000
Now, let me give you an example of how it works.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:00.000
You stand with your bike at the beginning of February.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:03.000
It's very cold, and you're standing in one of these rainy days,

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:05.000
and it's drizzling

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:08.000
and cold and chilly,

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:11.000
and you're standing in, let's say, Yokneam.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:14.000
And you look up at the sky through a hole in the clouds

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:17.000
you see the monastery at the top of the Muhraka --

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.000
that's where you're supposed to climb now --

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:22.000
and you say, "There's no way that I could possibly get there."

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:25.000
And yet, two hours later

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:28.000
you find yourself standing on the roof of this monastery,

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:31.000
smeared with mud,

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:33.000
blood and sweat.

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.000
And you look down at Yokneam;

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:37.000
everything is so small and tiny.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.000
And you say, "Hey, Alex. Look at this parking lot where we started.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.000
It's that big.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:43.000
I can't believe that I did it."

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.000
And that's the point

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:47.000
when you start loving yourself.

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.000
And so we talked about

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.000
these special words that we teach them.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:55.000
And at the end of each ride, we sit together

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:57.000
and share moments

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:00.000
in which those special words of the day

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.000
popped up and made a difference,

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.000
and these discussions

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.000
can be extremely inspiring.

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.000
In one of them, one of the kids once said,

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.000
"When we were riding on this ridge

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.000
overlooking the Dead Sea --

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:15.000
and he's talking about this spot here --

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:17.000
"I was reminded

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:19.000
of the day when I left my village in Ethiopia

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:22.000
and went away together with my brother.

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:24.000
We walked 120 kilometers

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:26.000
until we reached Sudan.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:29.000
This was the first place where we got some water and supplies."

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:32.000
And he goes on saying, and everyone looks at him like a hero,

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.000
probably for the first time in his life.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:37.000
And he says -- because I also have volunteers riding with me,

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.000
adults, who are sitting there

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:42.000
listening to him --

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:44.000
and he says, "And this was just the beginning

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:46.000
of our ordeal

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.000
until we ended up in Israel.

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.000
And only now," he says,

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:52.000
"I'm beginning to understand where I am,

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.000
and I actually like it."

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.000
Now I remember, when he said it,

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.000
I felt goosebumps on my body,

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:01.000
because he said it overlooking the Moab Mountains here in the background.

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:03.000
That's where Joshua descended

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:05.000
and crossed the Jordan

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:08.000
and led the people of Israel into the land of Canaan

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:10.000
3,000 years ago

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.000
in this final leg

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:15.000
of the journey from Africa.

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:17.000
And so, perspective

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:19.000
and context and history

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:21.000
play key roles

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.000
in the way I plan my rides

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:25.000
with the kids.

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:27.000
We visit Kibbutzim

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:30.000
that were established by Holocaust survivors.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:33.000
We explore ruins

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:36.000
of Palestinian villages,

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:39.000
and we discuss how they became ruins.

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:42.000
And we go through numerous remnants

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.000
of Jewish settlements, Nabatic settlements,

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:46.000
Canaanite settlements --

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.000
three-, four, five-thousand years old.

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.000
And through this tapestry,

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:53.000
which is the history of this country,

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.000
the kids acquire

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.000
what is probably the most important

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:59.000
value in education,

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:03.000
and that is the understanding that life is complex,

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:06.000
and there's no black and white.

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:08.000
And by appreciating complexity,

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:10.000
they become more tolerant,

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:13.000
and tolerance leads to hope.

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.000
I ride with these kids once a week,

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.000
every Tuesday.

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:21.000
Here's a picture I took last Tuesday -- less than a week ago --

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:23.000
and I ride with them tomorrow also.

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:26.000
In every one of these rides

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:29.000
I always end up standing in one of these incredible locations,

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:32.000
taking in this incredible landscape around me,

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.000
and I feel blessed and fortunate

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:36.000
that I'm alive,

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:38.000
and that I sense every fiber

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:40.000
in my aching body.

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.000
And I feel blessed and fortunate

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:44.000
that 15 years ago

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.000
I had the courage to resign

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.000
my tenured position at NYU

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:50.000
and return to my home country

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:52.000
where I can do these incredible rides

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:54.000
with this group of troubled kids

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:56.000
coming from Ethiopia

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:59.000
and Morocco and Russia.

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:01.000
And I feel blessed and fortunate

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.000
that every week, every Tuesday --

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:06.000
and actually every Friday also --

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:09.000
I can once again celebrate

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:12.000
in the marrow of my bones

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:15.000
the very essence of living in Israel on the edge.

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:17.000
Thank you.

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:24.000
(Applause)
