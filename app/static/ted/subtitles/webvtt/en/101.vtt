00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Thank you very much.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Now, I've got a story for you.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
When I arrived off the plane,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
after a very long journey from the West of England,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
my computer, my beloved laptop,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
had gone mad,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
and had -- oh! -- a bit like that! --

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
and the display on it --

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
anyway, the whole thing had burst.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
And I went to the IT guys here

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
and a gentleman mended my computer,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
and then he said, "What are you doing here?"

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
and I said "I'm playing the cello and I'm doing a bit of singing,"

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
and he said, "Oh, I sort of play the cello as well."

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
And I said, "Do you really?"

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
Anyway, so you're in for a treat,

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
because he's fantastic, and his name's Mark.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
(Applause)

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.000
I am also joined by my partner in crime, Thomas Dolby.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
(Applause)

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
This song is called "Farther than the Sun."

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:39.000
(Music)

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.000
♫ Strung in the wind I called you ♫

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:49.000
♫ but you did not hear ... ♫

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:56.000
♫ And you're a plant that needs poor soil ♫

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000
♫ and I have treated you too well ♫

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
♫ to give up flowers ... ♫

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
♫ Oh, I have been too rich for you ... ♫

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000
♫ Farther than the sun from me ♫

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000
♫ Farther than I'd have you be ♫

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
♫ And I go north, I get so cold ♫

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.000
♫ My heart is lava under stone ♫

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
♫ You are not worthy ♫

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
♫ You are not worthy ... ♫

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.000
♫ With your calculating eyes ♫

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000
♫ spinning figures ♫

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
♫ you cannot see me ♫

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
♫ You cannot see me ... ♫

00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:00.000
♫ And if I tell myself enough ♫

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
♫ I'll believe it ♫

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.000
♫ You are not worthy ♫

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.000
♫ The sea, it freezes over ... ♫

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:23.000
♫ to trap the light ♫

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:30.000
♫ And I'm in love with being in love ♫

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:35.000
♫ and you were never quite the one ♫

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000
♫ In Gerda's eyes ♫

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.000
♫ Fragments of what you've become ♫

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.000
♫ And all the moths that fly at night ♫

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.000
♫ believe electric light is bright ♫

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.000
♫ You are not worthy ♫

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.000
♫ You are not worthy ♫

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:19.000
♫ With your calculating eyes ♫

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.000
♫ Spinning figures ♫

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:28.000
♫ You cannot see me, no ♫

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:33.000
♫ And if I tell myself enough ♫

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:37.000
♫ I'll believe it ♫

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.000
♫ You are not worthy ♫

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.000
♫ Farther than the sun from me ♫

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:19.000
♫ Farther than I'd have you be ♫

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:25.000
♫ And I go north, I get so cold ♫

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.000
♫ My heart is lava under stone ♫

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.000
♫ You are not worthy ♫

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.000
♫ You are not worthy ♫

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.000
♫ With your calculating eyes ♫

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.000
♫ Spinning figures ♫

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:49.000
♫ You cannot see me, no ... ♫

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:56.000
♫ And if I tell myself enough, I'll believe it ♫

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.000
(Applause)

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.000
Thank you very much.
