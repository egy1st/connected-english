00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
I grew up

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
in a very small village in Canada,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
and I'm an undiagnosed

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
dyslexic.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
I had a really hard time in school.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
In fact, my mother told me eventually

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
that I was the little kid in the village

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
who cried all the way to school.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
I ran away.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
I left when I was 25 years old to go to Bali,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
and there I met my incredible wife, Cynthia,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
and together, over 20 years,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
we built an amazing jewelry business.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
It was a fairy tale, and then we retired.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
Then she took me to see a film

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
that I really didn't want to see.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
It ruined my life --

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
(Laughter)

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
"The Inconvenient Truth" and Mr. Gore.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
I have four kids,

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
and even if part of what he says is true,

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
they're not going to have the life that I had.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
And I decided at that moment

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
that I would spend the rest of my life

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
doing whatever I could

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
to improve their possibilities.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
So here's the world,

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
and here we are in Bali.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
It's a tiny, little island --

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
60 miles by 90 miles.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
It has an intact Hindu culture.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
Cynthia and I were there.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
We had had a wonderful life there,

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
and we decided to do something unusual.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
We decided to give back

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
locally.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
And here it is: it's called the Green School.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
I know it doesn't look like a school,

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
but it is something we decided to do,

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
and it is extremely,

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
extremely green.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
The classrooms have no walls.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
The teacher is writing on a bamboo blackboard.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
The desks are not square.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
At Green School, the children are smiling --

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
an unusual thing for school, especially for me.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
And we practice holism.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
And for me it's just the idea

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
that, if this little girl

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
graduates as a whole person,

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
chances are

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
she'll demand a whole world --

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
a whole world --

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
to live on.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
Our children spend 181 days

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
going to school in a box.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
The people that built my school

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000
also built the prison and the insane asylum

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000
out of the same materials.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
So if this gentleman

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
had had a holistic education,

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
would he be sitting there?

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000
Would he have had more possibilities in his life?

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
The classrooms have natural light.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000
They're beautiful. They're bamboo.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
The breeze passes through them.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000
And when the natural breeze isn't enough,

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
the kids deploy bubbles,

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
but not the kind of bubbles you know.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
These bubbles are made from natural cotton

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000
and rubber from the rubber tree.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
So we basically turned the box

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
into a bubble.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
And these kids know

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000
that painless climate control

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
may not be

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
part of their future.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000
We pay the bill at the end of the month,

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
but the people that are really going to pay the bill

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000
are our grandchildren.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000
We have to teach the kids

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000
that the world is not indestructible.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.000
These kids did a little graffiti on their desks,

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000
and then they signed up for two extra courses.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.000
The first one was called sanding

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.000
and the second one was called re-waxing.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.000
But since that happened,

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.000
they own those desks.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.000
They know they can control their world.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000
We're on the grid. We're not proud of it.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000
But an amazing alternative energy company in Paris

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000
is taking us off the grid with solar.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000
And this thing

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.000
is the second vortex to be built in the world,

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.000
in a two-and-a-half meter drop on a river.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000
When the turbine drops in,

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000
it will produce 8,000 watts of electricity,

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000
day and night.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
And you know what these are.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
There's nowhere to flush.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
And as long as we're taking our waste

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000
and mixing it with a huge amount of water --

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.000
you're all really smart, just do the math.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000
How many people times how much water.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000
There isn't enough water.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000
These are compost toilets,

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.000
and nobody at the school wanted to know about them,

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000
especially the principal.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.000
And they work. People use them. People are okay.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.000
It's something you should think about doing.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.000
Not many things didn't work.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.000
The beautiful canvas and rubber skylights

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000
got eaten by the sun in six months.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.000
We had to replace them with recyclable plastic.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.000
The teachers dragged giant PVC whiteboards

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000
into the classrooms.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000
So we had some good ideas:

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000
we took old automobile windshields, put paper behind them

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000
and created the first alternative

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000
to the whiteboard.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.000
Green School sits in south-central Bali,

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000
and it's on 20 acres

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000
of rolling garden.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.000
There's an amazing river traveling through it,

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000
and you can see there

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.000
how we manage to get across the river.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.000
I met a father the other day; he looked a little crazed.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.000
I said, "Welcome to Green School."

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.000
He said, "I've been on an airplane for 24 hours."

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.000
I asked him, "Why?"

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.000
He said, "I had a dream once about a green school,

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000
and I saw a picture of this green school,

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000
I got on an airplane.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.000
In August I'm bringing my sons."

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.000
This was a great thing.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000
But more than that,

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.000
people are building green houses around Green School,

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.000
so their kids can walk to school on the paths.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000
And people are bringing their green industries,

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.000
hopefully their green restaurants,

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.000
to the Green School.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000
It's becoming a community.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.000
It's becoming a green model.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.000
We had to look at everything.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000
No petrochemicals in the pavement.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000
No pavement.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000
These are volcanic stones laid by hand.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.000
There are no sidewalks.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.000
The sidewalks are gravel. They flood when it rains,

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.000
but they're green.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.000
This is the school buffalo.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.000
He's planning to eat that fence for dinner.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000
All the fences at Green School are green.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000
And when the kindergarten kids

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000
recently moved their gate,

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.000
they found out the fence was made out of tapioca.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.000
They took the tapioca roots up to the kitchen,

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.000
sliced them thinly and made delicious chips.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.000
Landscaping.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.000
We manage to keep the garden that was there

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:08.000
running right up to the edge of each of the classrooms.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.000
We dropped them gently in.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.000
We made space for these guys

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:16.000
who are Bali's last black pigs.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.000
And the school cow

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.000
is trying to figure out

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.000
how to replace the lawnmower

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.000
on the playing field.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.000
These young ladies

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000
are living in a rice culture,

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:32.000
but they know something that few people know in a rice culture.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.000
They know how to plant organic rice,

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000
they know how to look after it,

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.000
they know how to harvest and they know how to cook it.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.000
They're part of the rice cycle

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.000
and these skills will be valuable

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.000
for them in their future.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.000
This young man is picking organic vegetables.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:52.000
We feed 400 people lunch every day

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:55.000
and it's not a normal lunch. There's no gas.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.000
Local Balinese women

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:00.000
cook the food on sawdust burners

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.000
using secrets that only their grandmothers know.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:07.000
The food is incredible.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.000
Green School is a place of pioneers,

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000
local and global.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.000
And it's a kind of microcosm

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.000
of the globalized world.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.000
The kids are from 25 countries.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.000
When I see them together,

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:23.000
I know that they're working out

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:26.000
how to live in the future.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000
Green School is going into its third year

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.000
with 160 children.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000
It's a school where you do learn reading --

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.000
one of my favorites --

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.000
writing -- I was bad at it --

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.000
arithmetic.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.000
But you also learn other things.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000
You learn bamboo building.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.000
You practice

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000
ancient Balinese arts.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:49.000
This is called mud wrestling in the rice fields.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000
The kids love it.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.000
The mothers aren't quite convinced.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.000
(Laughter)

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.000
We've done a lot of outrageous things in our lives,

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:00.000
and we said, okay, local, what does "local" mean?

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000
Local means

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000
that 20 percent of the population of the school

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.000
has to be Balinese,

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.000
and this was a really big commitment.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.000
And we were right.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.000
And people are coming forward

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.000
from all over the world

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:18.000
to support the Balinese Scholarship Fund,

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:22.000
because these kids will be Bali's next green leaders.

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.000
The teachers are as diverse

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.000
as the student body,

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.000
and the amazing thing

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.000
is that volunteers are popping up.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.000
A man came from Java

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.000
with a new kind of organic agriculture.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:37.000
A woman came from Africa with music.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:40.000
And together these volunteers and the teachers

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.000
are deeply committed

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:44.000
to creating a new generation

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:47.000
of global, green leaders.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.000
The Green School effect --

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.000
we don't know what it is.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.000
We need someone to come and study it.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:57.000
But what's happening, our learning-different kids --

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.000
dyslexic --

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:02.000
we've renamed them prolexic --

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:06.000
are doing well in these beautiful, beautiful classrooms.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:09.000
And all the kids are thriving.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.000
And how did we do all this?

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:14.000
On giant grass.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.000
It's bamboo.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:19.000
It comes out of the ground like a train.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:22.000
It grows as high as a coconut tree in two months

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.000
and three years later it can be harvested

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.000
to build buildings like this.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:31.000
It's as strong and dense as teak

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:34.000
and it will hold up any roof.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:38.000
When the architects came, they brought us these things,

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.000
and you've probably seen things like this.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:43.000
The yellow box was called the administration complex.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.000
(Laughter)

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:48.000
We squashed it, we rethought it,

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:51.000
but mainly we renamed it

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:53.000
"the heart of school,"

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.000
and that changed everything forever.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.000
It's a double helix.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.000
It has administrators in it

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.000
and many, many other things.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:03.000
And the problem of building it --

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:05.000
when the Balinese workers

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:08.000
saw long reams of plans,

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:11.000
they looked at them and said, "What's this?"

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.000
So we built big models.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:16.000
We had them engineered by the engineers.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.000
And Balinese carpenters like this

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:21.000
measured them with their bamboo rulers,

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:24.000
selected the bamboo and built the buildings

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:27.000
using age-old techniques,

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:30.000
mostly by hand.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:33.000
It was chaos.

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:36.000
And the Balinese carpenters want to be as modern as we do,

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:39.000
so they use metal scaffolding

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:42.000
to build the bamboo building

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:45.000
and when the scaffolding came down,

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:50.000
we realized that we had a cathedral,

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.000
a cathedral to green,

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:55.000
and a cathedral to green education.

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:57.000
The heart of school has seven kilometers

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.000
of bamboo in it.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.000
From the time the foundations were finished,

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:04.000
in three months it had roofs and floors.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:07.000
It may not be the biggest bamboo building in the world,

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:09.000
but many people believe

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:12.000
that it's the most beautiful.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:15.000
Is this doable in your community?

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:17.000
We believe it is.

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:20.000
Green School is a model we built for the world.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:23.000
It's a model we built for Bali.

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:26.000
And you just have to follow these simple, simple rules:

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.000
be local,

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.000
let the environment lead

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.000
and think about

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:36.000
how your grandchildren might build.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:39.000
So, Mr. Gore, thank you.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:41.000
You ruined my life,

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:44.000
but you gave me an incredible future.

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:46.000
And if you're interested in being involved

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:49.000
in finishing Green School

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:51.000
and building the next 50 around the world,

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.000
please come and see us.

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.000
Thank you.

00:12:55.000 --> 00:13:13.000
(Applause)
