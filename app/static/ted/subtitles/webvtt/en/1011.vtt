00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Today I'm going to take you on a voyage

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
to some place so deep,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
so dark, so unexplored

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
that we know less about it than we know about the dark side of the moon.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
It's a place of myth and legend.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
It's a place marked on ancient maps

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
as "here be monsters."

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
It is a place where each new voyage of exploration

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
brings back new discoveries of creatures so wondrous and strange

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
that our forefathers would have considered them monstrous indeed.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Instead, they just make me green with envy

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
that my colleague from IUCN

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
was able to go on this journey to the south of Madagascar seamounts

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
to actually take photographs

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
and to see these wondrous creatures of the deep.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
We are talking about the high seas.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
The "high seas" is a legal term,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
but in fact, it covers 50 percent of the planet.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
With an average depth of the oceans

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
of 4,000 meters,

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
in fact, the high seas covers and provides

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
nearly 90 percent of the habitat

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
for life on this Earth.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
It is, in theory, the global commons,

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
belonging to us all.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
But in reality,

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
it is managed by and for

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
those who have the resources

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
to go out and exploit it.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
So today I'm going to take you on a voyage

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
to cast light on some of the outdated myths

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
and legends and assumptions

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
that have kept us as the true stakeholders

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
in the high seas in the dark.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
We're going to voyage to some of these special places

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
that we've been discovering in the past few years

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
to show why we really need to care.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
And then finally, we're going to try

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
to develop and pioneer a new perspective

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
on high seas governance

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
that's rooted in ocean-basin-wide conservation,

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
but framed in an arena of global norms

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
of precaution and respect.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
So here is a picture of the high seas

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
as seen from above --

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
that area in the darker blue.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
To me, as an international lawyer,

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
this scared me far more

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
than any of the creatures or the monsters we may have seen,

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
for it belies the notion that you can actually protect the ocean,

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
the global ocean,

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
that provides us all with carbon storage,

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
with heat storage, with oxygen,

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
if you can only protect 36 percent.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000
This is indeed the true heart of the planet.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
Some of the problems that we have to confront

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
are that the current international laws --

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
for example, shipping --

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
provide more protection

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
to the areas closest to shore.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
For example, garbage discharge,

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
something you would think just simply goes away,

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
but the laws regulating

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
ship discharge of garbage

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000
actually get weaker the further you are from shore.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000
As a result, we have garbage patches

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000
the size of twice-Texas.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
It's unbelievable.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000
We used to think the solution to pollution

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
was dilution,

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
but that has proved to be no longer the case.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
So what we have learned from social scientists

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
and economists like Elinor Ostrom,

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
who are studying the phenomenon

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000
of management of the commons on a local scale,

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000
is that there are certain prerequisites

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
that you can put into place

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
that enable you to manage

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000
and access open space

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000
for the good of one and all.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000
And these include a sense of shared responsibility,

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000
common norms that bind people together as a community.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.000
Conditional access: You can invite people in,

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.000
but they have to be able to play by the rules.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
And of course, if you want people to play by the rules,

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
you still need an effective system

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000
of monitoring and enforcement,

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000
for as we've discovered,

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000
you can trust, but you also need to verify.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000
What I'd also like to convey

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000
is that it is not all doom and gloom

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000
that we are seeing in the high seas.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000
For a group of very dedicated individuals --

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000
scientists, conservationists,

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.000
photographers and states --

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.000
were able to actually change a tragic trajectory

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000
that was destroying fragile seascapes

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
such as this coral garden

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
that you see in front of you.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000
That is, we're able to save it from a fate

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000
of deep-sea bottom trawling.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000
And how did we do that?

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.000
Well, as I said, we had a group of photographers that went out on board ships

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.000
and actually photographed the activities in process.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000
But we also spent many hours

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000
in the basements of the United Nations,

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.000
trying to work with governments to make them understand

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000
what was going on so far away from land

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000
that few of us had ever even imagined

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000
that these creatures existed.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
So within three years,

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000
from 2003 to 2006,

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000
we were able to get norm in place

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000
that actually changed the paradigm

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000
of how fishers went about

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000
deep-sea bottom trawling.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.000
Instead of "go anywhere, do anything you want,"

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000
we actually created a regime

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.000
that required prior assessment of where you're going

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.000
and a duty to prevent significant harm.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.000
In 2009, when the U.N. reviewed progress,

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000
they discovered

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.000
that almost 100 million square-kilometers of seabed

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000
had been protected.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000
This does not mean that it's the final solution,

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000
or that this even provides permanent protection.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000
But what it does mean

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000
is that a group of individuals can form a community

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000
to actually shape

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000
the way high seas are governed,

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000
to create a new regime.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000
So I'm looking optimistically at our opportunities

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.000
for creating a true, blue perspective

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000
for this beautiful planet.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000
Sylvia's wish

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.000
provides us with that leverage, that access

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000
to the heart of human beings,

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000
you might say,

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.000
who have rarely seen places beyond their own toes,

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.000
but are now hopefully going to become interested

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.000
in the full life-cycle of creatures like these sea turtles,

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.000
who indeed spend most of their time in the high seas.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.000
Today, we're just going to voyage to a small sampling

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000
of some of these special areas,

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000
just to give you an idea of the flavor

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.000
of the riches and wonders they do contain.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000
The Sargasso Sea, for example,

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.000
is not a sea bounded by coastlines,

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.000
but it is bounded by oceanic currents

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.000
that contain and envelope

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.000
this wealth of sargassum

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000
that grows and aggregates there.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:12.000
It's also known as the spawning ground for eels

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000
from Northern European

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.000
and Northern American rivers

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.000
that are now so dwindling in numbers

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000
that they've actually stopped showing up in Stockholm,

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.000
and five showed up in the U.K. just recently.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.000
But the Sargasso Sea,

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:28.000
the same way it aggregates sargassum weed,

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000
actually is pulling in the plastic

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000
from throughout the region.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000
This picture doesn't exactly show

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.000
the plastics that I would like it to show, because I haven't been out there myself.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000
But there has just been a study

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.000
that was released in February

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.000
that showed there are 200,000

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:46.000
pieces of plastic per square-kilometer

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:49.000
now floating in the surface of the Sargasso Sea,

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000
and that is affecting the habitat

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.000
for the many species in their juvenile stages

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000
who come to the Sargasso Sea

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.000
for its protection and its food.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.000
The Sargasso Sea is also a wondrous place

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000
for the aggregation of these unique species

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:07.000
that have developed to mimic the sargassum habitat.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000
It also provides a special habitat

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.000
for these flying fish to lay their eggs.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000
But what I'd like to get from this picture

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.000
is that we truly do have an opportunity

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.000
to launch a global initiative for protection.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:23.000
Thus, the government of Bermuda has recognized the need

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.000
and its responsibility

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.000
as having some of the Sargasso Sea

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000
within its national jurisdiction --

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000
but the vast majority is beyond --

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.000
to help spearhead a movement

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.000
to achieve protection for this vital area.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.000
Spinning down to someplace a little bit cooler than here right now:

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.000
the Ross Sea in the Southern Ocean.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.000
It's actually a bay.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.000
It's considered high seas, because the continent

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.000
has been put off limits

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.000
to territorial claims.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:51.000
So anything in the water is treated as if it's the high seas.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.000
But what makes the Ross Sea important

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:56.000
is the vast sea of pack ice

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.000
that in the spring and summer

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000
provides a wealth of phytoplankton and krill

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000
that supports what, till recently,

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000
has been a virtually intact

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:07.000
near-shore ecosystem.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.000
But unfortunately, CCAMLR,

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.000
the regional commission

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.000
in charge of conserving and managing fish stocks

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.000
and other living marine resources,

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.000
is unfortunately starting to give in to fishing interests

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.000
and has authorized the expansion

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:23.000
of toothfish fisheries in the region.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.000
The captain of a New Zealand vessel

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.000
who was just down there

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.000
is reporting a significant decline

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:32.000
in the number of the Ross Sea killer whales,

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.000
who are directly dependent on the Antarctic toothfish

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:37.000
as their main source of food.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:40.000
So what we need to do is to stand up boldly,

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000
singly and together,

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.000
to push governments,

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000
to push regional fisheries management organizations,

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.000
to declare our right

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.000
to declare certain areas off-limits to high seas fishing,

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.000
so that the freedom to fish no longer means

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:56.000
the freedom to fish anywhere and anytime.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:59.000
Coming closer to here, the Costa Rica Dome

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.000
is a recently discovered area --

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.000
potentially year-round habitat for blue whales.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.000
There's enough food there to last them

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.000
the summer and the winter long.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.000
But what's unusual about the Costa Rica Dome

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.000
is, in fact, it's not a permanent place.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.000
It's an oceanographic phenomenon

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:16.000
that shifts in time and space on a seasonal basis.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.000
So, in fact, it's not permanently in the high seas.

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:21.000
It's not permanently in the exclusive economic zones

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.000
of these five Central American countries,

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:26.000
but it moves with the season.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:29.000
As such, it does create a challenge to protect,

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:32.000
but we also have a challenge protecting the species that move along with it.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:35.000
We can use the same technologies that fishers use

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.000
to identify where the species are,

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.000
in order to close the area

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.000
when it's most vulnerable,

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:44.000
which may, in some cases, be year-round.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.000
Getting closer to shore, where we are,

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.000
this was in fact taken in the Galapagos.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.000
Many species are headed through this region,

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.000
which is why there's been so much attention

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.000
put into conservation

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.000
of the Eastern Tropical Pacific Seascape.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.000
This is the initiative that's been coordinated

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.000
by Conservation International

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.000
with a variety of partners and governments

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:05.000
to actually try to bring integrated management regime

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.000
throughout the area.

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.000
That is, it provides a wonderful example of where you can go

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.000
with a real regional initiative.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:14.000
It's protecting five World Heritage sites.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:17.000
Unfortunately, the World Heritage Convention

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:20.000
does not recognize the need to protect areas

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:23.000
beyond national jurisdiction, at present.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.000
So a place like the Costa Rica Dome

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.000
could not technically qualify

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.000
the time it's in the high seas.

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.000
So what we've been suggesting

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:34.000
is that we either need to amend the World Heritage Convention,

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:37.000
so that it can adopt

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:40.000
and urge universal protection of these World Heritage sites,

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.000
or we need to change the name

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:45.000
and call it Half-the-World Heritage Convention.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:48.000
But what we also know is that species like these sea turtles

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:52.000
do not stay put in the Eastern Tropical Pacific Seascape.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:55.000
These happen to go down to a vast South Pacific Gyre,

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.000
where they spend most of their time

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.000
and often end up getting hooked like this,

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.000
or as bycatch.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:04.000
So what I'd really like to suggest is that we need to scale-up.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:06.000
We need to work locally,

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:09.000
but we also need to work ocean-basin-wide.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:12.000
We have the tools and technologies now

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.000
to enable us to take a broader

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.000
ocean-basin-wide initiative.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:19.000
We've heard about the Tagging of Pacific Predators project,

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:22.000
one of the 17 Census of Marine Life projects.

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.000
It's provided us data like this,

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:27.000
of tiny, little sooty shearwaters

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.000
that make the entire ocean basin their home.

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.000
They fly 65,000 kilometers

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:33.000
in less than a year.

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:36.000
So we have the tools and treasures coming from the Census of Marine Life.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.000
And its culminating year

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.000
that's going to be launched in October.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:42.000
So stay tuned for further information.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:44.000
What I find so exciting

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:46.000
is that the Census of Marine Life

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:49.000
has looked at more than the tagging of pacific predators;

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:52.000
it's also looked in the really unexplored mid-water column,

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.000
where creatures like this flying sea cucumber

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.000
have been found.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:59.000
And fortunately, we've been able, as IUCN,

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.000
to team up with the Census of Marine Life

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.000
and many of the scientists working there

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:05.000
to actually try to translate

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:07.000
much of this information to policymakers.

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:10.000
We have the support of governments now behind us.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:13.000
We've been revealing this information through technical workshops.

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:16.000
And the exciting thing is that we do have sufficient information

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.000
to move ahead to protect some of these

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:21.000
significant hope spots, hotspots.

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:23.000
At the same time we're saying,

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:25.000
"Yes, we need more. We need to move forward."

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.000
But many of you have said,

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:29.000
if you get these marine protected areas,

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:32.000
or a reasonable regime for high seas fisheries management in place,

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.000
how are you going to enforce it?

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:37.000
Which leads me to my second passion besides ocean science,

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.000
which is outer space technology.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:41.000
I wanted to be an astronaut,

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.000
so I've constantly followed

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:45.000
what are the tools available to monitor Earth

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:47.000
from outer space --

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:50.000
and that we have incredible tools like we've been learning about,

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:52.000
in terms of being able to follow tagged species

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.000
throughout their life-cycles

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.000
in the open ocean.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:59.000
We can also tag and track fishing vessels.

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:02.000
Many already have transponders on board

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:05.000
that allow us to find out where they are and even what they're doing.

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:07.000
But not all the vessels have those to date.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:10.000
It does not take too much rocket science

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:13.000
to actually try to create new laws to mandate,

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:15.000
if you're going to have the privilege

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:18.000
of accessing our high seas resources,

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:20.000
we need to know -- someone needs to know --

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:23.000
where you are and what you're doing.

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:25.000
So it brings me to my main take-home message,

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:28.000
which is we can avert a tragedy of the commons.

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.000
We can stop the collision course

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.000
of 50 percent of the planet

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.000
with the high seas.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:37.000
But we need to think broad-scale. We need to think globally.

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:39.000
We need to change how we actually go about

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:42.000
managing these resources.

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.000
We need to get the new paradigm

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:46.000
of precaution and respect.

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.000
At the same time, we need to think locally,

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:51.000
which is the joy and marvel of Sylvia's hope spot wish,

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:53.000
is that we can shine a spotlight

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:56.000
on many of these previously unknown areas,

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:59.000
and to bring people to the table, if you will,

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:02.000
to actually make them feel part of this community

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.000
that truly has a stake

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:06.000
in their future management.

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:09.000
And third is that we need to look at ocean-basin-wide management.

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:12.000
Our species are ocean-basin-wide.

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:15.000
Many of the deep-sea communities

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:17.000
have genetic distribution

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:19.000
that goes ocean-basin-wide.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:21.000
We need to better understand,

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:24.000
but we also need to start to manage and protect.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.000
And in order to do that,

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.000
you also need ocean-basin management regimes.

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:31.000
That is, we have regional management regimes

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:33.000
within the exclusive economic zone,

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:36.000
but we need to scale these up, we need to build their capacity,

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:38.000
so they're like the Southern Ocean,

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:40.000
where they do have the two-pronged fisheries

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:43.000
and conservation organization.

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:46.000
So with that, I would just like to sincerely thank and honor

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.000
Sylvia Earle for her wish,

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:50.000
for it is helping us to put a face on the high seas

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:53.000
and the deep seas beyond national jurisdiction.

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:55.000
It's helping to bring an incredible group

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:57.000
of talented people together

00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:59.000
to really try to solve and penetrate

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:02.000
these problems that have created our obstacles

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:05.000
to management and rational use

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:09.000
of this area that was once so far away and remote.

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:12.000
So on this tour, I hope I provided you

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:14.000
with a new perspective of the high seas:

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:17.000
one, that it is our home too,

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:19.000
and that we need to work together

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:22.000
if we are to make this a sustainable ocean future for us all.

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:24.000
Thank you.

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:26.000
(Applause)
