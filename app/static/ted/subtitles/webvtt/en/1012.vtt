WEBVTT

00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:02.976
So, a funny thing happened

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.476
on my way to becoming a brilliant,
world-class neuropsychologist:

00:00:08.079 --> 00:00:09.251
I had a baby.

00:00:10.005 --> 00:00:11.260
And that's not to say

00:00:11.284 --> 00:00:15.222
I ever went on to become a brilliant,
world-class neuropsychologist.

00:00:15.246 --> 00:00:16.721
Sorry, TED.

00:00:17.715 --> 00:00:21.374
But I did go on to be a reasonably astute,

00:00:21.398 --> 00:00:23.276
arguably world-class worrier.

00:00:24.532 --> 00:00:27.076
One of my girlfriends
in graduate school, Marie,

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:29.845
said, "Kim, I figured it out.

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:32.676
It's not that you're more neurotic
than everyone else;

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.197
it's just that you're more honest
about how neurotic you are."

00:00:36.221 --> 00:00:39.235
So in the spirit of full disclosure,

00:00:39.259 --> 00:00:40.844
I brought some pictures to share.

00:00:41.892 --> 00:00:43.100
Awwww.

00:00:43.124 --> 00:00:44.125
(Laughter)

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:46.396
I'll just say: July.

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:51.210
(Laughter)

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:53.115
Zip!

00:00:53.139 --> 00:00:54.140
(Laughter)

00:00:54.164 --> 00:00:55.465
For safety.

00:00:55.489 --> 00:00:57.152
(Laughter)

00:00:57.176 --> 00:00:59.068
Water wings --

00:00:59.092 --> 00:01:01.318
an inch of water.

00:01:02.469 --> 00:01:04.463
And then, finally, all suited up

00:01:04.487 --> 00:01:06.835
for the 90-minute drive
to Copper Mountain.

00:01:07.279 --> 00:01:10.820
So you can get kind of a feel for this.

00:01:11.255 --> 00:01:14.699
So my baby, Vander,
is eight years old now.

00:01:14.723 --> 00:01:19.340
And, despite being cursed
with my athletic inability,

00:01:19.364 --> 00:01:20.937
he plays soccer.

00:01:20.961 --> 00:01:22.938
He's interested in playing football.

00:01:22.962 --> 00:01:25.223
He wants to learn how to ride a unicycle.

00:01:25.247 --> 00:01:27.446
So why would I worry?

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:30.447
Because this is what I do.
This is what I teach.

00:01:30.471 --> 00:01:32.543
It's what I study. It's what I treat.

00:01:32.567 --> 00:01:35.567
And I know that kids
get concussed every year.

00:01:36.683 --> 00:01:40.081
In fact, more than four million people
sustain a concussion every year,

00:01:40.105 --> 00:01:42.676
and these data are just
among kids under 14

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:44.962
who were seen in emergency rooms.

00:01:44.986 --> 00:01:47.676
And so when kids sustain a concussion,

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.676
we talk about them getting dinged
or getting their bell rung,

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.376
but what is it that
we're really talking about?

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:54.986
Let's take a look.

00:01:55.854 --> 00:01:57.979
[Concussive Force]

00:01:59.053 --> 00:02:02.598
"Starsky and Hutch"? Arguably, yes.

00:02:02.622 --> 00:02:03.882
So, a car accident.

00:02:03.906 --> 00:02:06.184
Forty miles an hour into a fixed barrier:

00:02:06.208 --> 00:02:07.522
35 Gs.

00:02:11.368 --> 00:02:14.393
A heavyweight boxer punches
you straight in the face:

00:02:14.417 --> 00:02:15.871
58 Gs.

00:02:17.535 --> 00:02:22.443
(Music)

00:02:22.467 --> 00:02:24.863
In case you missed it, we'll look again.

00:02:24.887 --> 00:02:27.075
So look to the right-hand
side of the screen.

00:02:28.751 --> 00:02:33.373
(Music)

00:02:33.397 --> 00:02:34.806
What would you say?

00:02:35.604 --> 00:02:36.983
How many Gs?

00:02:39.081 --> 00:02:40.363
Close.

00:02:40.891 --> 00:02:42.212
Seventy-two?

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:44.902
Would it be crazy to know:

00:02:44.926 --> 00:02:47.220
103 Gs?

00:02:47.628 --> 00:02:49.370
The average concussive impact

00:02:49.394 --> 00:02:51.360
is 95 Gs.

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:56.043
Now, when the kid
on the right doesn't get up,

00:02:56.067 --> 00:02:57.676
we know they've had a concussion.

00:02:57.700 --> 00:02:59.325
But how about the kid on the left,

00:02:59.349 --> 00:03:01.843
or the athlete that leaves
the field of play?

00:03:01.867 --> 00:03:05.499
How do we know if he or she
has sustained a concussion?

00:03:06.342 --> 00:03:07.671
How do we know

00:03:07.695 --> 00:03:11.255
that legislation that would require
they be pulled from play,

00:03:11.279 --> 00:03:13.358
cleared for return to play,

00:03:13.382 --> 00:03:14.556
applies to them?

00:03:15.485 --> 00:03:17.027
The definition of concussion

00:03:17.051 --> 00:03:19.684
doesn't actually require
a loss of consciousness.

00:03:19.708 --> 00:03:22.461
It requires only a change
in consciousness,

00:03:22.485 --> 00:03:25.097
and that can be any one
or a number of symptoms,

00:03:25.121 --> 00:03:28.279
including feeling foggy, feeling dizzy,

00:03:28.303 --> 00:03:29.978
hearing a ringing in your ear,

00:03:30.002 --> 00:03:32.660
being more impulsive
or hostile than usual.

00:03:33.509 --> 00:03:36.787
So given all of that and given
how darn neurotic I am,

00:03:36.811 --> 00:03:39.368
how do I get any sleep at all?

00:03:39.392 --> 00:03:43.705
Because I know our brains are resilient.

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:48.064
They're designed to recover
from an injury.

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:50.676
If -- God forbid --

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:53.896
any of us left here tonight
and sustained a concussion,

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:57.396
most of us would go on to fully recover
inside of a couple hours

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:58.866
to a couple of weeks.

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:01.211
But kids are more vulnerable
to brain injury.

00:04:01.235 --> 00:04:04.520
In fact, high-school athletes
are three times more likely

00:04:04.544 --> 00:04:06.892
to sustain catastrophic injuries

00:04:06.916 --> 00:04:09.417
relative even to their college-age peers,

00:04:09.441 --> 00:04:13.106
and it takes them longer
to return to a symptom-free baseline.

00:04:14.748 --> 00:04:16.978
After that first injury,

00:04:17.002 --> 00:04:20.808
their risk for second injury
is exponentially greater.

00:04:20.832 --> 00:04:25.745
From there, their risk for a third injury,
greater still, and so on.

00:04:26.752 --> 00:04:29.590
And here's the really alarming part:

00:04:30.143 --> 00:04:34.907
We don't fully understand
the long-term impact of multiple injuries.

00:04:35.899 --> 00:04:38.023
You guys may be familiar
with this research

00:04:38.047 --> 00:04:39.625
that's coming out of the NFL.

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:43.207
In a nutshell,
this research suggests that,

00:04:43.231 --> 00:04:48.474
among retired NFL players
with three or more career concussions,

00:04:48.498 --> 00:04:51.474
the incidence of early-onset
dementing disease

00:04:51.498 --> 00:04:54.263
is much greater than it
is for the general population.

00:04:54.826 --> 00:04:57.676
So you've all seen that --
New York Times, you've seen it.

00:04:57.700 --> 00:04:59.302
What you may not be familiar with

00:04:59.326 --> 00:05:04.445
is that this research was spearheaded
by NFL wives who said,

00:05:04.469 --> 00:05:07.446
"Isn't it weird
that my 46-year-old husband

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:09.133
is forever losing his keys?"

00:05:09.533 --> 00:05:12.304
"Isn't it weird that
my 47-year-old husband

00:05:12.328 --> 00:05:14.208
is forever losing the car?"

00:05:14.835 --> 00:05:17.700
"Isn't it weird that
my 48-year-old husband

00:05:17.724 --> 00:05:19.745
is forever losing his way home

00:05:19.769 --> 00:05:22.720
in the car, from the driveway?"

00:05:23.038 --> 00:05:27.631
I may have forgotten to mention
that my son is an only child.

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:31.640
So it's going to be really important

00:05:31.664 --> 00:05:35.664
that he be able to drive
me around someday.

00:05:36.016 --> 00:05:37.166
(Laughter)

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:42.022
So, how do we guarantee
the safety of our kids?

00:05:42.549 --> 00:05:47.382
How can we 100 percent
guarantee the safety of our kids?

00:05:47.406 --> 00:05:49.312
Let me tell you what I've come up with.

00:05:50.883 --> 00:05:55.676
(Laughter)

00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:57.008
If only.

00:05:57.032 --> 00:06:00.021
My little boy's right there,
and he's like, "She's not kidding.

00:06:00.045 --> 00:06:01.448
She's totally not kidding."

00:06:02.214 --> 00:06:04.782
So in all seriousness:

00:06:04.806 --> 00:06:06.453
Should my kid play football?

00:06:06.477 --> 00:06:08.264
Should your kid play football?

00:06:08.288 --> 00:06:09.454
I don't know.

00:06:09.478 --> 00:06:12.985
But I do know there are
three things you can do.

00:06:13.009 --> 00:06:15.851
The first: study up.

00:06:15.875 --> 00:06:19.604
You have to be familiar with the issues
we're talking about today.

00:06:19.628 --> 00:06:22.194
There are some great resources out there.

00:06:22.218 --> 00:06:24.512
The CDC has a program, HEADS UP.

00:06:24.536 --> 00:06:26.170
It's at CDC.gov.

00:06:26.194 --> 00:06:29.582
HEADS UP is specific
to concussion in kids.

00:06:29.606 --> 00:06:32.856
The second is a resource
I'm personally really proud of.

00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:35.522
We've just rolled this out
in the last couple months --

00:06:35.546 --> 00:06:36.918
CO Kids With Brain Injury.

00:06:37.239 --> 00:06:39.891
This is a great resource
for student athletes,

00:06:39.915 --> 00:06:44.304
teachers, parents, professionals,
athletic and coaching staff.

00:06:44.328 --> 00:06:48.081
It's a great place to start
if you have questions.

00:06:48.883 --> 00:06:51.024
The second thing is: speak up.

00:06:52.205 --> 00:06:53.414
Just two weeks ago,

00:06:53.438 --> 00:06:55.415
a bill introduced by Senator Kefalas

00:06:55.439 --> 00:06:59.349
that would have required
athletes, kids under 18,

00:06:59.373 --> 00:07:01.687
to wear a helmet
when they're riding their bike,

00:07:01.711 --> 00:07:02.975
died in committee.

00:07:04.422 --> 00:07:06.179
It died, in large part,

00:07:06.203 --> 00:07:09.133
because it lacked constituent buy-in;

00:07:09.157 --> 00:07:11.270
it lacked stakeholder traction.

00:07:11.660 --> 00:07:13.076
Now, I'm not here to tell you

00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:16.001
what kind of legislation
you should or shouldn't support,

00:07:16.025 --> 00:07:19.099
but I am going to tell you
that, if it matters to you,

00:07:19.123 --> 00:07:22.037
your legislators need to know that.

00:07:22.644 --> 00:07:24.467
Speak up also with coaching staff.

00:07:24.491 --> 00:07:27.468
Ask about what kind
of protective equipment is available.

00:07:27.492 --> 00:07:29.541
What's the budget
for protective equipment?

00:07:29.565 --> 00:07:31.115
How old it is?

00:07:31.139 --> 00:07:34.845
Maybe offer to spearhead
a fundraiser to buy new gear.

00:07:34.869 --> 00:07:37.866
Which brings us to: suit up.

00:07:37.890 --> 00:07:39.357
Wear a helmet.

00:07:40.422 --> 00:07:43.676
The only way to prevent a bad outcome

00:07:43.700 --> 00:07:46.700
is to prevent that first injury
from happening.

00:07:47.700 --> 00:07:52.259
Recently, one of my graduate
students, Tom, said,

00:07:52.283 --> 00:07:55.852
"Kim, I've decided to wear a bike helmet
on the way to class."

00:07:56.684 --> 00:08:00.580
And Tom knows that that little bit
of foam in a bike helmet

00:08:00.604 --> 00:08:03.896
can reduce the g-force of impact by half.

00:08:04.658 --> 00:08:09.619
Now, I thought it was because I have
this totally compelling helmet crusade,

00:08:09.643 --> 00:08:11.351
this epiphany of Tom's.

00:08:11.786 --> 00:08:15.453
As it turns out, it occurred
to Tom that a $20 helmet

00:08:15.477 --> 00:08:19.676
is a good way to protect
a $100,000 graduate education.

00:08:19.700 --> 00:08:21.724
(Laughter)

00:08:21.748 --> 00:08:23.271
So ...

00:08:25.079 --> 00:08:26.746
Should Vander play football?

00:08:28.111 --> 00:08:29.414
I can't say no,

00:08:29.438 --> 00:08:33.676
but I can guarantee that every time
he leaves the house,

00:08:33.700 --> 00:08:35.309
that kid's wearing a helmet --

00:08:36.422 --> 00:08:38.399
like, to the car,

00:08:38.423 --> 00:08:40.137
or at school.

00:08:41.088 --> 00:08:43.769
So whether athlete, scholar,

00:08:43.793 --> 00:08:46.468
overprotected kid, neurotic mom,

00:08:46.492 --> 00:08:48.278
or otherwise,

00:08:48.302 --> 00:08:50.190
here's my baby, Vander,

00:08:50.214 --> 00:08:51.595
reminding you

00:08:51.619 --> 00:08:54.134
to mind your matter.

00:08:54.700 --> 00:08:55.868
Thank you.

00:08:55.892 --> 00:09:01.150
(Applause)
