00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.000
I woke up in the middle of the night

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
with the sound of heavy explosion.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
It was deep at night.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
I do not remember what time it was.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
I just remember the sound

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
was so heavy

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
and so very shocking.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Everything in my room was shaking --

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
my heart, my windows,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
my bed, everything.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
I looked out the windows

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
and I saw a full half-circle

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
of explosion.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
I thought it was just like the movies,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
but the movies had not conveyed them

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
in the powerful image that I was seeing

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
full of bright red

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
and orange and gray,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
and a full circle of explosion.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
And I kept on staring at it

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
until it disappeared.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
I went back to my bed,

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
and I prayed,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
and I secretly thanked God

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
that that missile

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
did not land on my family's home,

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
that it did not kill my family that night.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
Thirty years have passed,

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
and I still feel guilty about that prayer,

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
for the next day, I learned that that missile

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000
landed on my brother's friend's home

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
and killed him

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
and his father,

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
but did not kill his mother or his sister.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
His mother showed up the next week

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
at my brother's classroom

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
and begged seven-year-old kids

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
to share with her any picture they may have

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
of her son,

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
for she had lost everything.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
This is not a story

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000
of a nameless survivor of war,

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
and nameless refugees,

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
whose stereotypical images we see in our newspapers

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000
and our TV

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
with tattered clothes,

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
dirty face, scared eyes.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000
This is not a story of a nameless someone

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
who lived in some war,

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
who we do not know their hopes, their dreams,

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
their accomplishments, their families,

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
their beliefs, their values.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
This is my story.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
I was that girl.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000
I am another image and vision

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000
of another survivor of war.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
I am that refugee,

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
and I am that girl.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
You see,

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000
I grew up in war-torn Iraq,

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
and I believe that there are two sides of wars

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
and we've only seen

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
one side of it.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
We only talk about

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
one side of it.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
But there's another side

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
that I have witnessed

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
as someone who lived in it

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000
and someone who ended up working in it.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000
I grew up with the colors of war --

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000
the red colors of fire and blood,

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000
the brown tones of earth

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000
as it explodes

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
in our faces

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
and the piercing silver

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
of an exploded missile,

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
so bright

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000
that nothing can protect your eyes from it.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000
I grew up

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000
with the sounds of war --

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.000
the staccato sounds of gunfire,

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.000
the wrenching booms of explosions,

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000
ominous drones of jets flying overhead

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000
and the wailing warning sounds

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000
of sirens.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.000
These are the sounds you would expect,

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000
but they are also the sounds

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
of dissonant concerts of a flock of birds

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
screeching in the night,

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000
the high-pitched honest cries

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000
of children

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000
and the thunderous,

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000
unbearable

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000
silence.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000
"War," a friend of mine said,

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000
"is not about sound at all.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.000
It is actually about silence,

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000
the silence of humanity."

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.000
I have since left Iraq

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.000
and founded a group called Women for Women International

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000
that ends up working

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.000
with women survivors of wars.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000
In my travels and in my work,

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.000
from Congo to Afghanistan,

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000
from Sudan to Rwanda,

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000
I have learned not only

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.000
that the colors and the sounds of war are the same,

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.000
but the fears of war are the same.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000
You know, there is a fear of dying,

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.000
and do not believe any movie character

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000
where the hero is not afraid.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000
It is very scary

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000
to go through that feeling

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000
of "I am about to die"

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000
or "I could die in this explosion."

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000
But there's also the fear

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000
of losing loved ones,

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000
and I think that's even worse.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000
It's too painful. You don't want to think about it.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:22.000
But I think the worst kind of fear is the fear --

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.000
as Samia, a Bosnian woman, once told me,

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.000
who survived the four-years besiege of Sarajevo;

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000
she said, "The fear

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000
of losing

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.000
the 'I' in me,

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.000
the fear of losing

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000
the 'I' in me."

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000
That's what my mother in Iraq

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000
used to tell me.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.000
It's like dying from inside-out.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.000
A Palestinian woman once told me,

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.000
"It is not about the fear of one death,"

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.000
she said, "sometimes I feel

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.000
I die 10 times in one day,"

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.000
as she was describing the marches of soldiers

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000
and the sounds of their bullets.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.000
She said, "But it's not fair,

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.000
because there is only one life,

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.000
and there should only be one death."

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.000
We have been only seeing

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000
one side of war.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.000
We have only been discussing and consumed

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000
with high-level preoccupations

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.000
over troop levels, drawdown timelines,

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000
surges and sting operations,

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.000
when we should be examining the details

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.000
of where the social fabric

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.000
has been most torn,

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.000
where the community has improvised

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.000
and survived

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000
and shown acts of resilience

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000
and amazing courage

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.000
just to keep life going.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.000
We have been so consumed

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000
with seemingly objective discussions

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000
of politics, tactics,

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.000
weapons, dollars

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.000
and casualties.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000
This is the language

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.000
of sterility.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.000
How casually

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.000
we treat casualties

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.000
in the context of this topic.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.000
This is where we conceive of rape and casualties

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:16.000
as inevitabilities.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:19.000
Eighty percent of refugees around the world

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:22.000
are women and children. Oh.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.000
Ninety percent of modern war casualties

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.000
are civilians.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.000
Seventy-five percent of them are women and children.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:32.000
How interesting.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.000
Oh, half a million women in Rwanda

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000
get raped in 100 days.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.000
Or, as we speak now,

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.000
hundreds of thousands of Congolese women

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.000
are getting raped and mutilated.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.000
How interesting.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:49.000
These just become numbers that we refer to.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000
The front of wars

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:55.000
is increasingly non-human eyes

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.000
peering down on our perceived enemies

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.000
from space,

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:02.000
guiding missiles toward unseen targets,

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000
while the human conduct

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.000
of the orchestra of media relations

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:09.000
in the event that this particular drone attack

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.000
hits a villager

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.000
instead of an extremist.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.000
It is a chess game.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.000
You learn to play an international relations school

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.000
on your way out and up

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:23.000
to national and international leadership.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.000
Checkmate.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000
We are missing

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.000
a completely other side of wars.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:35.000
We are missing my mother's story,

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:38.000
who made sure with every siren, with every raid,

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.000
with every cut off-of electricity,

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000
she played puppet shows for my brothers and I,

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.000
so we would not be scared

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000
of the sounds of explosions.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:49.000
We are missing the story of Fareeda,

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000
a music teacher,

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.000
a piano teacher, in Sarajevo,

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.000
who made sure

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.000
that she kept the music school open

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.000
every single day

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:02.000
in the four years of besiege in Sarajevo

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000
and walked to that school,

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.000
despite the snipers shooting

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.000
at that school and at her,

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:11.000
and kept the piano, the violin, the cello

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:14.000
playing the whole duration of the war,

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:17.000
with students wearing their gloves and hats and coats.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.000
That was her fight.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:22.000
That was her resistance.

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:25.000
We are missing the story of Nehia,

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.000
a Palestinian woman in Gaza

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:30.000
who, the minute there was a cease-fire in the last year's war,

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.000
she left out of home,

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.000
collected all the flour

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:37.000
and baked as much bread for every neighbor to have,

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:40.000
in case there is no cease-fire the day after.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.000
We are missing

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.000
the stories of Violet,

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:48.000
who, despite surviving genocide in the church massacre,

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.000
she kept on going on,

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:53.000
burying bodies, cleaning homes, cleaning the streets.

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:56.000
We are missing stories of women

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:59.000
who are literally keeping life going

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.000
in the midst of wars.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.000
Do you know --

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:06.000
do you know that people fall in love in war

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:09.000
and go to school

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.000
and go to factories and hospitals

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.000
and get divorced and go dancing and go playing

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:16.000
and live life going?

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.000
And the ones who are keeping that life

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.000
are women.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:25.000
There are two sides of war.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.000
There is a side that fights,

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.000
and there is a side that keeps the schools

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:33.000
and the factories and the hospitals open.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:36.000
There is a side that is focused on winning battles,

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.000
and there is a side that is focused

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:41.000
on winning life.

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:44.000
There is a side that leads the front-line discussion,

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.000
and there is a side

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:49.000
that leads the back-line discussion.

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.000
There is a side that thinks

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:54.000
that peace is the end of fighting,

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.000
and there is a side that thinks

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.000
that peace is the arrival

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:02.000
of schools and jobs.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:04.000
There is a side

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:06.000
that is led by men,

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.000
and there is a side

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.000
that is led by women.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:13.000
And in order for us to understand

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:16.000
how do we build lasting peace,

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:19.000
we must understand war and peace

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.000
from both sides.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.000
We must have a full picture

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.000
of what that means.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.000
In order for us to understand

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.000
what actually peace means,

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.000
we need to understand,

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:33.000
as one Sudanese woman once told me,

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:36.000
"Peace is the fact that my toenails

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:39.000
are growing back again."

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.000
She grew up in Sudan, in Southern Sudan,

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:43.000
for 20 years of war,

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:46.000
where it killed one million people

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:49.000
and displaced five million refugees.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.000
Many women were taken as slaves

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.000
by rebels and soldiers,

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:56.000
as sexual slaves who were forced also

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.000
to carry the ammunition and the water

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.000
and the food for the soldiers.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:03.000
So that woman walked for 20 years,

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:06.000
so she would not be kidnapped again.

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:09.000
And only when there was some sort of peace,

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:12.000
her toenails grew back again.

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:15.000
We need to understand peace

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:18.000
from a toenail's perspective.

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:21.000
We need to understand

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:23.000
that we cannot actually have negotiations

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:25.000
of ending of wars or peace

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:28.000
without fully including women

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.000
at the negotiating table.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.000
I find it amazing

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.000
that the only group of people

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.000
who are not fighting and not killing

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:39.000
and not pillaging and not burning and not raping,

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:41.000
and the group of people who are mostly --

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.000
though not exclusively --

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:46.000
who are keeping life going in the midst of war,

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:49.000
are not included in the negotiating table.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:54.000
And I do argue that women lead the back-line discussion,

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.000
but there are also men

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.000
who are excluded from that discussion.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.000
The doctors who are not fighting,

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:03.000
the artists, the students, the men who refuse to pick up the guns,

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:05.000
they are, too, excluded

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:08.000
from the negotiating tables.

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:11.000
There is no way we can talk about a lasting peace,

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:14.000
building of democracy, sustainable economies,

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.000
any kind of stabilities,

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:19.000
if we do not fully include women

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:21.000
at the negotiating table.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:24.000
Not one, but 50 percent.

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:28.000
There is no way we can talk about the building of stability

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:31.000
if we don't start investing

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.000
in women and girls.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:35.000
Did you know

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:37.000
that one year

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:39.000
of the world's military spending

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:42.000
equals 700 years

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:45.000
of the U.N. budget

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:48.000
and equals 2,928 years

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:51.000
of the U.N. budget allocated for women?

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:54.000
If we just reverse

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.000
that distribution of funds,

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:59.000
perhaps we could have

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:02.000
a better lasting peace in this world.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.000
And last, but not least,

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:07.000
we need to invest in peace and women,

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:10.000
not only because it is the right thing to do,

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:13.000
not only because it is the right thing to do,

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:16.000
for all of us to build sustainable and lasting peace today,

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:19.000
but it is for the future.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:21.000
A Congolese woman,

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:23.000
who was telling me about

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:26.000
how her children saw their father killed in front of them

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:29.000
and saw her raped in front of them

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:31.000
and mutilated in front of them,

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:33.000
and her children saw their nine-year-old sibling

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:36.000
killed in front of them,

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:39.000
how they're doing okay right now.

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:41.000
She got into Women for Women International's program.

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:43.000
She got a support network.

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:45.000
She learned about her rights.

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:48.000
We taught her vocational and business skills. We helped her get a job.

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:51.000
She was earning 450 dollars. She was doing okay.

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:53.000
She was sending them to school. Have a new home.

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:56.000
She said, "But what I worry about the most

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:58.000
is not any of that.

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:00.000
I worry that my children

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:03.000
have hate in their hearts,

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:06.000
and when they want to grow up, they want to fight again

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:09.000
the killers of their father and their brother."

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:13.000
We need to invest in women,

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:16.000
because that's our only chance

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:18.000
to ensure that there is no more war

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.000
in the future.

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:23.000
That mother has a better chance to heal her children

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:26.000
than any peace agreement can do.

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:30.000
Are there good news? Of course, there are good news. There are lots of good news.

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:33.000
To start with, these women that I told you about

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:36.000
are dancing and singing every single day,

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:38.000
and if they can,

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:40.000
who are we not to dance?

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:42.000
That girl that I told you about

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:45.000
ended up starting Women for Women International Group

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:48.000
that impacted one million people, sent 80 million dollars,

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:50.000
and I started this from zero,

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:53.000
nothing, nada, [unclear].

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:56.000
(Laughter)

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:59.000
They are women who are standing on their feet

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:02.000
in spite of their circumstances,

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:05.000
not because of it.

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:08.000
Think of how the world can be a much better place

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:10.000
if, for a change,

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:12.000
we have a better equality,

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:14.000
we have equality,

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:16.000
we have a representation

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:18.000
and we understand war,

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:20.000
both from the front-line

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:22.000
and the back-line discussion.

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:25.000
Rumi, a 13th-century Sufi poet,

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:27.000
says, "Out beyond the worlds

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:30.000
of right-doings and wrong-doings,

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:32.000
there is a field.

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:34.000
I will meet you there.

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:37.000
When the soul lies down in that grass,

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:39.000
the world is too full

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:41.000
to talk about.

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:43.000
Ideas, language,

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:45.000
even the phrase 'each other'

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:48.000
no longer makes any sense."

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:52.000
I humbly add -- humbly add --

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:54.000
that out beyond

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:57.000
the worlds of war and peace,

00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:59.000
there is a field,

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:02.000
and there are many women and men

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:05.000
[who] are meeting there.

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:08.000
Let us make this field a much bigger place.

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:11.000
Let us all meet in that field.

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:13.000
Thank you.

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:24.000
(Applause)
