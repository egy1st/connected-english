WEBVTT

00:00:00.936 --> 00:00:02.626
So I'm going to talk about work;

00:00:02.650 --> 00:00:06.436
specifically, why people can't
seem to get work done at work,

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:08.889
which is a problem we all kind of have.

00:00:08.913 --> 00:00:11.076
But let's sort of start at the beginning.

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:14.706
So, we have companies
and non-profits and charities

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:19.674
and all these groups that have
employees or volunteers of some sort.

00:00:20.198 --> 00:00:23.904
And they expect these people
who work for them

00:00:23.928 --> 00:00:25.610
to do great work --

00:00:25.634 --> 00:00:26.976
I would hope, at least.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.715
At least good work, hopefully,
at least it's good work --

00:00:29.739 --> 00:00:30.976
hopefully great work.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.048
And so what they typically
do is they decide

00:00:33.072 --> 00:00:36.976
that all these people need to come
together in one place to do that work.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.975
So a company, or a charity,
or an organization of any kind,

00:00:39.999 --> 00:00:44.163
unless you're working in Africa,
if you're really lucky to do that --

00:00:44.187 --> 00:00:46.420
most people have to go
to an office every day.

00:00:46.444 --> 00:00:48.380
And so these companies,

00:00:48.404 --> 00:00:50.129
they build offices.

00:00:50.153 --> 00:00:53.049
They go out and they buy a building,
or they rent a building,

00:00:53.073 --> 00:00:54.976
or they lease some space,

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.976
and they fill this space with stuff.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.976
They fill it with tables, or desks,

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.875
chairs, computer equipment,

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:06.976
software, Internet access,

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.245
maybe a fridge, maybe a few other things,

00:01:10.269 --> 00:01:12.850
and they expect their employees,
or their volunteers,

00:01:12.874 --> 00:01:15.523
to come to that location
every day to do great work.

00:01:15.547 --> 00:01:18.468
It seems like it's perfectly
reasonable to ask that.

00:01:18.492 --> 00:01:20.825
However, if you actually talk to people

00:01:20.849 --> 00:01:23.493
and even question yourself,
and you ask yourself,

00:01:23.517 --> 00:01:27.031
where do you really want to go when you
really need to get something done?

00:01:27.055 --> 00:01:30.781
You'll find out that people don't say
what businesses think they would say.

00:01:30.805 --> 00:01:32.302
If you ask people the question:

00:01:32.326 --> 00:01:35.142
Where do you need to go
when you need to get something done?

00:01:35.166 --> 00:01:37.640
Typically, you get three different
kinds of answers.

00:01:37.664 --> 00:01:40.527
One is kind of a place
or a location or a room.

00:01:40.551 --> 00:01:42.495
Another one is a moving object,

00:01:42.519 --> 00:01:44.186
and a third is a time.

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:46.222
So here are some examples.

00:01:46.246 --> 00:01:49.477
I've been asking people this question
for about 10 years:

00:01:49.501 --> 00:01:52.657
"Where do you go when you
really need to get something done?"

00:01:52.681 --> 00:01:56.229
I'll hear things like, the porch,
the deck, the kitchen.

00:01:56.253 --> 00:01:59.301
I'll hear things like
an extra room in the house,

00:01:59.325 --> 00:02:00.602
the basement,

00:02:00.626 --> 00:02:02.527
the coffee shop, the library.

00:02:03.547 --> 00:02:06.102
And then you'll hear
things like the train,

00:02:06.126 --> 00:02:09.226
a plane, a car -- so, the commute.

00:02:09.666 --> 00:02:11.378
And then you'll hear people say,

00:02:11.402 --> 00:02:13.404
"Well, it doesn't really
matter where I am,

00:02:13.428 --> 00:02:16.940
as long as it's early in the morning
or late at night or on the weekends."

00:02:16.964 --> 00:02:19.789
You almost never hear
someone say, "The office."

00:02:19.813 --> 00:02:23.385
But businesses are spending all this money
on this place called the office,

00:02:23.409 --> 00:02:25.663
and they're making people
go to it all the time,

00:02:25.687 --> 00:02:27.722
yet people don't do work in the office.

00:02:27.746 --> 00:02:28.909
What is that about?

00:02:28.933 --> 00:02:30.393
(Laughter)

00:02:30.417 --> 00:02:33.670
Why is that? Why is that happening?

00:02:34.093 --> 00:02:35.363
And what you find out is,

00:02:35.387 --> 00:02:38.775
if you dig a little bit deeper,
you find out that people --

00:02:38.799 --> 00:02:40.449
this is what happens:

00:02:40.473 --> 00:02:42.202
People go to work,

00:02:42.226 --> 00:02:44.536
and they're basically
trading in their work day

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:48.052
for a series of "work moments" --
that's what happens at the office.

00:02:48.076 --> 00:02:50.759
You don't have a work day anymore.
You have work moments.

00:02:50.783 --> 00:02:53.561
It's like the front door
of the office is like a Cuisinart,

00:02:53.585 --> 00:02:55.887
and you walk in and your day
is shredded to bits,

00:02:55.911 --> 00:02:58.459
because you have 15 minutes here,
30 minutes there,

00:02:58.483 --> 00:03:01.206
and something else happens,
you're pulled off your work,

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:05.119
then you have 20 minutes, then it's lunch,
then you have something else to do ...

00:03:05.143 --> 00:03:08.953
Then you've got 15 minutes, and someone
pulls you aside and asks you a question,

00:03:08.977 --> 00:03:11.173
and before you know it, it's 5 p.m.,

00:03:11.197 --> 00:03:12.769
and you look back on the day,

00:03:12.793 --> 00:03:15.824
and you realize that you
didn't get anything done.

00:03:15.848 --> 00:03:17.205
We've all been through this.

00:03:17.229 --> 00:03:21.032
We probably went through it yesterday
or the day before, or the day before that.

00:03:21.056 --> 00:03:22.470
You look back on your day,

00:03:22.494 --> 00:03:24.510
and you're like,
"I got nothing done today.

00:03:24.534 --> 00:03:29.124
I was at work. I sat at my desk.
I used my expensive computer.

00:03:29.148 --> 00:03:31.385
I used the software they told me to use.

00:03:31.409 --> 00:03:33.862
I went to these meetings
I was asked to go to.

00:03:33.886 --> 00:03:36.583
I did these conference calls.
I did all this stuff.

00:03:36.607 --> 00:03:38.976
But I didn't actually do anything.

00:03:39.432 --> 00:03:40.584
I just did tasks.

00:03:40.608 --> 00:03:43.048
I didn't actually get
meaningful work done."

00:03:43.447 --> 00:03:46.383
And what you find is that,
especially with creative people --

00:03:46.407 --> 00:03:51.976
designers, programmers,
writers, engineers, thinkers --

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.888
that people really need long stretches
of uninterrupted time

00:03:55.912 --> 00:03:57.234
to get something done.

00:03:57.258 --> 00:04:00.686
You cannot ask somebody
to be creative in 15 minutes

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:02.329
and really think about a problem.

00:04:02.353 --> 00:04:03.719
You might have a quick idea,

00:04:03.743 --> 00:04:07.702
but to be in deep thought about a problem
and really consider a problem carefully,

00:04:07.726 --> 00:04:10.114
you need long stretches
of uninterrupted time.

00:04:10.611 --> 00:04:13.313
And even though the work day
is typically eight hours,

00:04:13.337 --> 00:04:16.892
how many people here have ever had
eight hours to themselves at the office?

00:04:16.916 --> 00:04:18.083
How about seven hours?

00:04:18.107 --> 00:04:21.315
Six? Five? Four?

00:04:21.339 --> 00:04:24.491
When's the last time you had
three hours to yourself at the office?

00:04:24.515 --> 00:04:26.537
Two hours? One, maybe?

00:04:26.561 --> 00:04:28.276
Very, very few people actually have

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:30.974
long stretches of uninterrupted
time at an office.

00:04:30.998 --> 00:04:34.528
And this is why people
choose to do work at home,

00:04:34.552 --> 00:04:36.131
or they might go to the office,

00:04:36.155 --> 00:04:38.790
but they might go to the office
really early in the day,

00:04:38.814 --> 00:04:40.640
or late at night when no one's around,

00:04:40.664 --> 00:04:42.732
or they stick around
after everyone's left,

00:04:42.756 --> 00:04:44.170
or go in on the weekends,

00:04:44.194 --> 00:04:47.285
or they get work done on the plane,
in the car or in the train,

00:04:47.309 --> 00:04:49.214
because there are no distractions.

00:04:49.238 --> 00:04:51.433
Now there are different
kinds of distractions,

00:04:51.457 --> 00:04:54.846
but not the really bad distractions,
which I'll talk about in a minute.

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:59.334
And this whole phenomenon of having
short bursts of time to get things done

00:04:59.358 --> 00:05:03.000
reminds me of another thing
that doesn't work when you're interrupted,

00:05:03.024 --> 00:05:04.209
and that is sleep.

00:05:04.771 --> 00:05:07.960
I think that sleep and work
are very closely related --

00:05:07.984 --> 00:05:11.682
not because you can work while you're
sleeping and sleep while you're working.

00:05:11.706 --> 00:05:13.150
That's not really what I mean.

00:05:13.174 --> 00:05:19.245
I'm talking specifically about the fact
that sleep and work are phase-based,

00:05:19.269 --> 00:05:21.000
or stage-based, events.

00:05:21.324 --> 00:05:27.379
Sleep is about sleep phases, or stages --
some people call them different things.

00:05:27.403 --> 00:05:31.237
There are five of them, and in order
to get to the really deep ones,

00:05:31.261 --> 00:05:34.030
the meaningful ones,
you have to go through the early ones.

00:05:34.054 --> 00:05:37.245
If you're interrupted while you're
going through the early ones --

00:05:37.269 --> 00:05:40.976
if someone bumps you in bed,
or there's a sound, or whatever happens --

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000
you don't just pick up where you left off.

00:05:43.024 --> 00:05:44.976
If you're interrupted and woken up,

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:46.738
you have to start again.

00:05:46.762 --> 00:05:49.976
So you have to go back
a few phases and start again.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.767
And what ends up happening --
you might have days like this

00:05:52.791 --> 00:05:56.339
where you wake up at eight or seven
in the morning, or whenever you get up,

00:05:56.363 --> 00:05:58.479
and you're like,
"I didn't sleep very well.

00:05:58.503 --> 00:06:01.071
I did the sleep thing --
I went to bed, I laid down,

00:06:01.095 --> 00:06:03.473
but I didn't really sleep."

00:06:03.497 --> 00:06:05.863
People say you go "to" sleep,

00:06:05.887 --> 00:06:09.005
but you don't go to sleep,
you go towards sleep; it takes a while.

00:06:09.029 --> 00:06:11.084
You've got to go through phases and stuff,

00:06:11.108 --> 00:06:13.417
and if you're interrupted,
you don't sleep well.

00:06:13.441 --> 00:06:15.797
So does anyone here
expect someone to sleep well

00:06:15.821 --> 00:06:17.403
if they're interrupted all night?

00:06:17.427 --> 00:06:19.141
I don't think anyone would say yes.

00:06:19.165 --> 00:06:21.490
Why do we expect people to work well

00:06:21.514 --> 00:06:23.986
if they're being interrupted
all day at the office?

00:06:24.010 --> 00:06:26.444
How can we possibly expect
people to do their job

00:06:26.468 --> 00:06:28.573
if they go to the office
and are interrupted?

00:06:28.597 --> 00:06:31.504
That doesn't really seem
like it makes a lot of sense, to me.

00:06:31.528 --> 00:06:35.396
So what are the interruptions that happen
at the office but not at other places?

00:06:35.420 --> 00:06:39.681
Because in other places, you can have
interruptions like the TV,

00:06:39.705 --> 00:06:42.976
or you could go for a walk,
or there's a fridge downstairs,

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:46.105
or you've got your own couch,
or whatever you want to do.

00:06:46.129 --> 00:06:48.938
If you talk to certain managers,
they'll tell you

00:06:48.962 --> 00:06:51.533
that they don't want
their employees to work at home

00:06:51.557 --> 00:06:53.454
because of these distractions.

00:06:53.478 --> 00:06:56.509
They'll sometimes also say,

00:06:56.533 --> 00:06:59.376
"If I can't see the person,
how do I know they're working?"

00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:02.701
which is ridiculous, but that's one
of the excuses that managers give.

00:07:02.725 --> 00:07:05.982
And I'm one of these managers.
I understand. I know how this goes.

00:07:06.006 --> 00:07:08.729
We all have to improve
on this sort of thing.

00:07:08.753 --> 00:07:10.723
But oftentimes they'll cite distractions:

00:07:10.747 --> 00:07:12.381
"I can't let someone work at home.

00:07:12.405 --> 00:07:14.421
They'll watch TV, or do this other thing."

00:07:14.445 --> 00:07:17.180
It turns out those aren't
the things that are distracting,

00:07:17.204 --> 00:07:19.160
Because those are voluntary distractions.

00:07:19.184 --> 00:07:21.636
You decide when you want
to be distracted by the TV,

00:07:21.660 --> 00:07:23.351
when you want to turn something on,

00:07:23.375 --> 00:07:25.769
or when you want to go
downstairs or go for a walk.

00:07:25.793 --> 00:07:26.944
At the office,

00:07:26.968 --> 00:07:28.991
most of the interruptions and distractions

00:07:29.015 --> 00:07:32.132
that really cause people not
to get work done are involuntary.

00:07:32.156 --> 00:07:35.267
So let's go through a couple of those.

00:07:35.291 --> 00:07:38.608
Now, managers and bosses
will often have you think

00:07:38.632 --> 00:07:40.636
that the real distractions at work

00:07:40.660 --> 00:07:43.470
are things like Facebook and Twitter

00:07:43.494 --> 00:07:46.664
and YouTube and other websites,

00:07:46.688 --> 00:07:50.530
and in fact, they'll go so far
as to actually ban these sites at work.

00:07:50.554 --> 00:07:53.895
Some of you may work at places
where you can't get to certain sites.

00:07:53.919 --> 00:07:56.538
I mean, is this China?
What the hell is going on here?

00:07:56.562 --> 00:07:59.305
You can't go to a website at work,
and that's the problem?

00:07:59.329 --> 00:08:01.337
That's why people aren't
getting work done,

00:08:01.361 --> 00:08:03.289
because they're on Facebook and Twitter?

00:08:03.313 --> 00:08:05.566
That's kind of ridiculous.
It's a total decoy.

00:08:06.297 --> 00:08:09.714
Today's Facebook and Twitter and YouTube,

00:08:09.738 --> 00:08:11.976
these things are just
modern-day smoke breaks.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:16.015
No one cared about letting people take
a smoke break for 15 minutes 10 years ago,

00:08:16.039 --> 00:08:18.657
so why does anyone care
if someone goes to Facebook

00:08:18.681 --> 00:08:20.792
or Twitter or YouTube here and there?

00:08:20.816 --> 00:08:23.393
Those aren't the real
problems in the office.

00:08:23.417 --> 00:08:27.028
The real problems are
what I like to call the M&amp;Ms,

00:08:27.052 --> 00:08:29.305
the Managers and the Meetings.

00:08:29.329 --> 00:08:32.718
Those are the real problems
in the modern office today.

00:08:32.742 --> 00:08:35.222
And this is why
things don't get done at work,

00:08:35.246 --> 00:08:37.046
it's because of the M&amp;Ms.

00:08:37.070 --> 00:08:39.372
Now what's interesting is,

00:08:39.396 --> 00:08:42.537
if you listen to all the places
that people talk about doing work,

00:08:42.561 --> 00:08:46.525
like at home, in the car, on a plane,
late at night, or early in the morning,

00:08:46.549 --> 00:08:48.680
you don't find managers and meetings.

00:08:48.704 --> 00:08:51.941
You find a lot of other distractions,
but not managers and meetings.

00:08:51.965 --> 00:08:54.942
So these are the things
that you don't find elsewhere,

00:08:54.966 --> 00:08:56.561
but you do find at the office.

00:08:57.371 --> 00:09:00.722
And managers are basically people
whose job it is to interrupt people.

00:09:00.746 --> 00:09:04.238
That's pretty much what managers are for.
They're for interrupting people.

00:09:04.262 --> 00:09:08.101
They don't really do the work, so they
make sure everyone else is doing work,

00:09:08.125 --> 00:09:09.849
which is an interruption.

00:09:09.873 --> 00:09:13.467
We have lots of managers in the world now,
and a lot of people in the world,

00:09:13.491 --> 00:09:15.592
and a lot of interruptions
by these managers.

00:09:15.616 --> 00:09:17.669
They have to check in:
"Hey, how's it going?

00:09:17.693 --> 00:09:19.577
Show me what's up." This sort of thing.

00:09:19.601 --> 00:09:21.759
They keep interrupting you
at the wrong time,

00:09:21.783 --> 00:09:25.084
while you're actually trying to do
something they're paying you to do,

00:09:25.108 --> 00:09:26.511
they tend to interrupt you.

00:09:26.535 --> 00:09:28.098
That's kind of bad.

00:09:28.122 --> 00:09:31.233
But what's even worse is the thing
that managers do most of all,

00:09:31.257 --> 00:09:32.704
which is call meetings.

00:09:32.728 --> 00:09:35.274
And meetings are just toxic,

00:09:35.298 --> 00:09:38.300
terrible, poisonous things

00:09:38.324 --> 00:09:39.743
during the day at work.

00:09:39.767 --> 00:09:40.983
(Laughter)

00:09:41.007 --> 00:09:42.794
We all know this to be true,

00:09:42.818 --> 00:09:46.039
and you would never see a spontaneous
meeting called by employees.

00:09:46.063 --> 00:09:47.324
It doesn't work that way.

00:09:47.348 --> 00:09:49.076
The manager calls the meeting

00:09:49.100 --> 00:09:51.015
so the employees can all come together,

00:09:51.039 --> 00:09:53.762
and it's an incredibly disruptive
thing to do to people --

00:09:53.786 --> 00:09:54.976
to say, "Hey look,

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:58.698
we're going to bring 10 people
together right now and have a meeting.

00:09:58.722 --> 00:10:00.214
I don't care what you're doing,

00:10:00.238 --> 00:10:03.245
you've got to stop doing it,
so you can have this meeting."

00:10:03.269 --> 00:10:06.643
I mean, what are the chances
that all 10 people are ready to stop?

00:10:06.667 --> 00:10:10.420
What if they're thinking about something
important, or doing important work?

00:10:10.444 --> 00:10:14.233
All of a sudden you tell them they have
to stop doing that to do something else.

00:10:14.257 --> 00:10:16.976
So they go into a meeting room,
they get together,

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:20.272
and they talk about stuff
that doesn't really matter, usually.

00:10:20.296 --> 00:10:21.940
Because meetings aren't work.

00:10:21.964 --> 00:10:24.130
Meetings are places to go
to talk about things

00:10:24.154 --> 00:10:25.851
you're supposed to be doing later.

00:10:25.875 --> 00:10:27.846
But meetings also procreate.

00:10:27.870 --> 00:10:30.135
So one meeting tends
to lead to another meeting,

00:10:30.159 --> 00:10:31.644
which leads to another meeting.

00:10:31.668 --> 00:10:33.874
There's often too many people
in the meetings,

00:10:33.898 --> 00:10:36.623
and they're very, very expensive
to the organization.

00:10:36.647 --> 00:10:39.772
Companies often think of a one-hour
meeting as a one-hour meeting,

00:10:39.796 --> 00:10:42.257
but that's not true,
unless there's only one person.

00:10:42.281 --> 00:10:45.805
If there are 10 people, it's a 10-hour
meeting, not a one-hour meeting.

00:10:45.829 --> 00:10:49.106
It's 10 hours of productivity taken
from the rest of the organization

00:10:49.130 --> 00:10:52.469
to have this one-hour meeting,
which probably should have been handled

00:10:52.493 --> 00:10:54.976
by two or three people
talking for a few minutes.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.539
But instead, there's a long
scheduled meeting,

00:10:57.563 --> 00:11:00.134
because meetings are scheduled
the way software works,

00:11:00.158 --> 00:11:03.559
which is in increments of 15 minutes,
or 30 minutes, or an hour.

00:11:03.583 --> 00:11:07.226
You don't schedule an eight-hour meeting
with Outlook; you can't.

00:11:07.250 --> 00:11:10.224
You can go 15 minutes or 30 minutes
or 45 minutes or an hour.

00:11:10.248 --> 00:11:12.222
And so we tend to fill these times up

00:11:12.246 --> 00:11:14.405
when things should go really quickly.

00:11:14.429 --> 00:11:18.079
So meetings and managers are
two major problems in businesses today,

00:11:18.103 --> 00:11:19.262
especially at offices.

00:11:19.286 --> 00:11:21.932
These things don't exist
outside of the office.

00:11:22.428 --> 00:11:27.229
So I have some suggestions
to remedy the situation.

00:11:27.253 --> 00:11:28.976
What can managers do --

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:30.976
enlightened managers, hopefully --

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:34.472
what can they do to make the office
a better place for people to work,

00:11:34.496 --> 00:11:37.341
so it's not the last resort,
but it's the first resort,

00:11:37.365 --> 00:11:38.707
so that people start to say,

00:11:38.731 --> 00:11:41.508
"When I really want to get stuff done,
I go to the office."

00:11:41.532 --> 00:11:43.446
Because the offices are well-equipped;

00:11:43.470 --> 00:11:45.604
everything is there
for them to do the work.

00:11:45.628 --> 00:11:48.889
But they don't want to go there right
now, so how do we change that?

00:11:48.913 --> 00:11:50.947
I have three suggestions
to share with you.

00:11:50.971 --> 00:11:53.842
I have about three minutes,
so that'll fit perfectly.

00:11:53.866 --> 00:11:56.703
We've all heard
of the Casual Friday thing.

00:11:56.727 --> 00:11:58.576
I don't know if people still do that.

00:11:58.600 --> 00:12:00.276
But how about "No-talk Thursdays?"

00:12:00.300 --> 00:12:02.332
(Laughter)

00:12:02.356 --> 00:12:05.302
Pick one Thursday once a month,

00:12:05.326 --> 00:12:08.637
and cut it in half, just the afternoon --
I'll make it easy for you.

00:12:08.661 --> 00:12:10.391
So just the afternoon, one Thursday.

00:12:10.415 --> 00:12:12.669
First Thursday of the month,
just the afternoon,

00:12:12.693 --> 00:12:14.757
nobody in the office
can talk to each other.

00:12:14.781 --> 00:12:16.319
Just silence, that's it.

00:12:16.343 --> 00:12:17.976
And what you'll find

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.408
is that a tremendous amount
of work gets done

00:12:20.432 --> 00:12:22.036
when no one talks to each other.

00:12:22.060 --> 00:12:24.124
This is when people
actually get stuff done,

00:12:24.148 --> 00:12:26.664
is when no one's bothering them
or interrupting them.

00:12:26.688 --> 00:12:29.649
Giving someone four hours
of uninterrupted time

00:12:29.673 --> 00:12:31.847
is the best gift you can
give anybody at work.

00:12:31.871 --> 00:12:33.284
It's better than a computer,

00:12:33.308 --> 00:12:36.062
better than a new monitor,
better than new software,

00:12:36.086 --> 00:12:38.061
or whatever people typically use.

00:12:38.085 --> 00:12:40.489
Giving them four hours
of quiet time at the office

00:12:40.513 --> 00:12:42.434
is going to be incredibly valuable.

00:12:42.458 --> 00:12:46.426
If you try that, I think you'll agree,
and hopefully you can do it more often.

00:12:46.450 --> 00:12:48.172
So maybe it's every other week,

00:12:48.196 --> 00:12:49.976
or every week, once a week,

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:52.053
afternoons no one can talk to each other.

00:12:52.077 --> 00:12:55.164
That's something that you'll find
will really, really work.

00:12:55.188 --> 00:12:57.490
Another thing you can try,

00:12:57.514 --> 00:13:00.976
is switching from active
communication and collaboration,

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:04.191
which is like face-to-face stuff --
tapping people on the shoulder,

00:13:04.215 --> 00:13:06.191
saying hi to them, having meetings,

00:13:06.215 --> 00:13:09.001
and replace that with more
passive models of communication,

00:13:09.025 --> 00:13:11.326
using things like email
and instant messaging,

00:13:11.350 --> 00:13:14.302
or collaboration products,
things like that.

00:13:14.628 --> 00:13:17.549
Now some people might say
email is really distracting,

00:13:17.573 --> 00:13:21.143
I.M. is really distracting, and these
other things are really distracting,

00:13:21.167 --> 00:13:24.739
but they're distracting at a time
of your own choice and your own choosing.

00:13:24.763 --> 00:13:27.571
You can quit the email app;
you can't quit your boss.

00:13:27.595 --> 00:13:29.373
You can quit I.M.;

00:13:29.397 --> 00:13:31.214
you can't hide your manager.

00:13:31.238 --> 00:13:32.976
You can put these things away,

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:36.381
and then you can be interrupted
on your own schedule, at your own time,

00:13:36.405 --> 00:13:38.882
when you're available,
when you're ready to go again.

00:13:38.906 --> 00:13:40.976
Because work, like sleep,
happens in phases.

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:43.093
So you'll be going up, doing some work,

00:13:43.117 --> 00:13:45.076
and then you'll come down from that work,

00:13:45.100 --> 00:13:47.552
and then maybe it's time
to check that email or I.M.

00:13:47.576 --> 00:13:50.077
There are very, very few things
that are that urgent,

00:13:50.101 --> 00:13:53.148
that need to happen, that need
to be answered right this second.

00:13:53.172 --> 00:13:54.347
So if you're a manager,

00:13:54.371 --> 00:13:57.355
start encouraging people to use
more things like I.M. and email

00:13:57.379 --> 00:13:59.395
and other things that someone can put away

00:13:59.419 --> 00:14:01.620
and then get back to you
on their own schedule.

00:14:01.644 --> 00:14:05.223
And the last suggestion I have is that,

00:14:05.247 --> 00:14:06.976
if you do have a meeting coming up,

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:10.626
if you have the power, just cancel it.

00:14:10.650 --> 00:14:12.110
Just cancel that next meeting.

00:14:12.134 --> 00:14:13.300
(Laughter)

00:14:13.324 --> 00:14:15.969
Today's Friday, usually people
have meetings on Monday.

00:14:15.993 --> 00:14:17.155
Just don't have it.

00:14:17.179 --> 00:14:18.584
I don't mean move it;

00:14:18.608 --> 00:14:21.250
I mean just erase it
from memory, it's gone.

00:14:21.274 --> 00:14:23.862
And you'll find out that everything
will be just fine.

00:14:23.886 --> 00:14:26.902
All these discussions and decisions
you thought you had to make

00:14:26.926 --> 00:14:28.710
at this one time at 9 a.m. on Monday,

00:14:28.734 --> 00:14:31.031
just forget about them,
and things will be fine.

00:14:31.055 --> 00:14:34.036
People will have a more open morning,
they can actually think.

00:14:34.060 --> 00:14:36.835
You'll find out all these things
you thought you had to do,

00:14:36.859 --> 00:14:38.312
you don't actually have to do.

00:14:38.336 --> 00:14:42.328
So those are just three quick suggestions
I wanted to give you guys to think about.

00:14:42.352 --> 00:14:45.377
I hope that some of these ideas
were at least provocative enough

00:14:45.401 --> 00:14:47.507
for managers and bosses
and business owners

00:14:47.531 --> 00:14:50.347
and organizers and people
who are in charge of other people,

00:14:50.371 --> 00:14:52.242
to think about laying off a little bit,

00:14:52.266 --> 00:14:54.401
and giving people more time
to get work done.

00:14:54.425 --> 00:14:56.235
I think it'll all pay off in the end.

00:14:56.259 --> 00:14:58.261
So, thanks for listening.

00:14:58.285 --> 00:14:59.944
(Applause)
