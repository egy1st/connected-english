WEBVTT

00:00:00.999 --> 00:00:07.817
(Applause)

00:00:07.841 --> 00:00:09.014
Thank you very much.

00:00:09.038 --> 00:00:10.976
I have a few pictures,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.626
and I'll talk a little bit
about how I'm able to do what I do.

00:00:15.145 --> 00:00:17.507
All these houses are built

00:00:17.531 --> 00:00:20.380
from between 70 and 80 percent
recycled material,

00:00:20.404 --> 00:00:23.555
stuff that was headed to the mulcher,
the landfill, the burn pile.

00:00:23.579 --> 00:00:24.976
It was all just gone.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.976
This is the first house I built.

00:00:27.312 --> 00:00:30.703
This double front door here
with the three-light transom,

00:00:30.727 --> 00:00:32.867
that was headed to the landfill.

00:00:32.891 --> 00:00:34.723
Have a little turret there.

00:00:34.747 --> 00:00:37.804
And then these buttons
on the corbels here --

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:39.981
right there --

00:00:40.005 --> 00:00:41.361
those are hickory nuts.

00:00:41.385 --> 00:00:43.492
And these buttons there --

00:00:43.516 --> 00:00:44.843
those are chicken eggs.

00:00:44.867 --> 00:00:46.036
(Laughter)

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:47.821
Of course, first you have breakfast,

00:00:47.845 --> 00:00:51.760
and then you fill the shell full
of Bondo and paint it and nail it up,

00:00:51.784 --> 00:00:55.228
and you have an architectural button
in just a fraction of the time.

00:00:55.926 --> 00:00:58.163
This is a look at the inside.

00:00:58.187 --> 00:01:01.452
You can see the three-light transom
there with the eyebrow windows.

00:01:01.476 --> 00:01:04.530
Certainly an architectural antique
headed to the landfill --

00:01:04.554 --> 00:01:07.152
even the lockset
is probably worth 200 dollars.

00:01:07.738 --> 00:01:09.625
Everything in the kitchen was salvaged.

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:11.646
There's a 1952 O'Keefe &amp; Merritt stove,

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.976
if you like to cook -- cool stove.

00:01:14.582 --> 00:01:16.388
This is going up into the turret.

00:01:16.723 --> 00:01:19.647
I got that staircase for 20 dollars,

00:01:19.671 --> 00:01:21.555
including delivery to my lot.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.064
(Laughter)

00:01:24.514 --> 00:01:26.816
Then, looking up in the turret,

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:30.459
you see there are bulges
and pokes and sags and so forth.

00:01:30.483 --> 00:01:32.125
Well, if that ruins your life,

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:33.976
well, then, you shouldn't live there.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.877
(Laughter)

00:01:35.901 --> 00:01:38.700
This is a laundry chute.

00:01:38.724 --> 00:01:41.139
And this right here is a shoe last --

00:01:41.163 --> 00:01:43.995
those are those cast-iron things
you see at antique shops.

00:01:44.019 --> 00:01:45.308
So I had one of those,

00:01:45.332 --> 00:01:49.078
so I made some low-tech gadgetry,
where you just stomp on the shoe last,

00:01:49.102 --> 00:01:51.976
and then the door flies open
and you throw your laundry down.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.786
And then if you're smart enough,
it goes on a basket on top of the washer.

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:58.424
If not, it goes into the toilet.

00:01:58.448 --> 00:02:00.497
(Laughter)

00:02:00.521 --> 00:02:02.204
This is a bathtub I made,

00:02:02.228 --> 00:02:04.285
made out of scrap two-by-four.

00:02:04.309 --> 00:02:08.543
Started with the rim, and then glued
and nailed it up into a flat,

00:02:08.567 --> 00:02:10.261
corbeled it up and flipped it over,

00:02:10.285 --> 00:02:12.262
then did the two profiles on this side.

00:02:12.286 --> 00:02:13.646
It's a two-person tub.

00:02:14.175 --> 00:02:17.118
After all, it's not just
a question of hygiene,

00:02:17.142 --> 00:02:19.634
but there's a possibility
of recreation as well.

00:02:19.658 --> 00:02:22.427
(Laughter)

00:02:22.451 --> 00:02:28.318
Then, this faucet here
is just a piece of Osage orange.

00:02:28.342 --> 00:02:29.914
It looks a little phallic,

00:02:29.938 --> 00:02:31.639
but after all, it's a bathroom.

00:02:31.663 --> 00:02:34.259
(Laughter)

00:02:34.632 --> 00:02:36.605
This is a house based on a Budweiser can.

00:02:36.629 --> 00:02:38.321
It doesn't look like a can of beer,

00:02:38.345 --> 00:02:40.849
but the design take-offs
are absolutely unmistakable:

00:02:40.873 --> 00:02:43.205
the barley hops design
worked up into the eaves,

00:02:43.229 --> 00:02:46.977
then the dentil work comes directly
off the can's red, white, blue and silver.

00:02:47.001 --> 00:02:49.439
Then, these corbels going
down underneath the eaves

00:02:49.463 --> 00:02:51.641
are that little design
that comes off the can.

00:02:51.665 --> 00:02:54.284
I just put a can on a copier
and kept enlarging it

00:02:54.308 --> 00:02:55.824
until I got the size I want.

00:02:55.848 --> 00:02:58.395
Then, on the can it says,

00:02:58.419 --> 00:03:00.126
"This is the famous Budweiser beer,

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:02.208
we know of no other beer,
blah, blah, blah."

00:03:02.232 --> 00:03:03.525
So we changed that and put,

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:07.048
"This is the famous Budweiser house.
We don't know of any other house ..."

00:03:07.072 --> 00:03:08.224
and so forth and so on.

00:03:08.248 --> 00:03:09.405
This is a deadbolt.

00:03:09.429 --> 00:03:13.171
It's a fence from a 1930s shaper,
which is a very angry woodworking machine.

00:03:13.195 --> 00:03:16.171
And they gave me the fence,
but they didn't give me the shaper,

00:03:16.195 --> 00:03:17.866
so we made a deadbolt out of it.

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:20.131
That'll keep bull elephants
out, I promise.

00:03:20.155 --> 00:03:21.160
(Laughter)

00:03:21.184 --> 00:03:24.038
And sure enough, we've had
no problems with bull elephants.

00:03:24.062 --> 00:03:25.224
(Laughter)

00:03:25.248 --> 00:03:28.161
The shower is intended
to simulate a glass of beer.

00:03:28.185 --> 00:03:31.656
We've got bubbles going up there,
then suds at the top with lumpy tiles.

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:34.369
Where do you get lumpy tiles?
Well, of course, you don't.

00:03:34.393 --> 00:03:38.094
But I get a lot of toilets, and so you
just dispatch a toilet with a hammer,

00:03:38.118 --> 00:03:39.976
and then you have lumpy tiles.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.523
And then the faucet is a beer tap.

00:03:43.547 --> 00:03:46.273
(Laughter)

00:03:46.297 --> 00:03:50.699
Then, this panel of glass
is the same panel of glass

00:03:50.723 --> 00:03:53.570
that occurs in every middle-class
front door in America.

00:03:53.594 --> 00:03:56.102
We're getting tired of it.
It's kind of clichÃ©d now.

00:03:56.126 --> 00:03:59.551
If you put it in the front door,
your design fails.

00:03:59.575 --> 00:04:02.301
So don't put it in the front door;
put it somewhere else.

00:04:02.325 --> 00:04:03.851
It's a pretty panel of glass.

00:04:03.875 --> 00:04:05.616
But if you put it in the front door,

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:08.148
people say, "Oh, you're trying
to be like those guys,

00:04:08.172 --> 00:04:09.323
and you didn't make it."

00:04:09.347 --> 00:04:10.502
So don't put it there.

00:04:11.179 --> 00:04:12.976
Then, another bathroom upstairs.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:14.237
This light up here

00:04:14.261 --> 00:04:18.036
is the same light that occurs
in every middle-class foyer in America.

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:19.555
Don't put it in the foyer.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.737
Put it in the shower, or in the closet,

00:04:22.761 --> 00:04:24.121
but not in the foyer.

00:04:25.902 --> 00:04:28.588
Then, somebody gave me
a bidet, so it got a bidet.

00:04:28.612 --> 00:04:31.034
(Laughter)

00:04:31.058 --> 00:04:32.686
This little house here,

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:36.639
those branches there are made
out of Bois d'arc or Osage orange.

00:04:36.663 --> 00:04:40.131
These pictures will keep scrolling
as I talk a little bit.

00:04:40.155 --> 00:04:42.421
In order to do what I do,

00:04:42.445 --> 00:04:46.200
you have to understand what causes
waste in the building industry.

00:04:46.224 --> 00:04:48.857
Our housing has become a commodity,

00:04:48.881 --> 00:04:51.174
and I'll talk a little bit about that.

00:04:51.198 --> 00:04:54.309
But the first cause of waste
is probably even buried in our DNA.

00:04:54.333 --> 00:04:56.801
Human beings have a need
for maintaining consistency

00:04:56.825 --> 00:04:58.170
of the apperceptive mass.

00:04:58.782 --> 00:04:59.933
What does that mean?

00:04:59.957 --> 00:05:02.239
What it means is,
for every perception we have,

00:05:02.263 --> 00:05:04.853
it needs to tally
with the one like it before,

00:05:04.877 --> 00:05:08.271
or we don't have continuity,
and we become a little bit disoriented.

00:05:08.295 --> 00:05:10.976
So I can show you an object
you've never seen before.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:12.901
Oh, that's a cell phone.

00:05:13.376 --> 00:05:15.985
But you've never seen this one before.

00:05:16.009 --> 00:05:17.167
What you're doing

00:05:17.191 --> 00:05:20.191
is sizing up the pattern
of structural features,

00:05:20.215 --> 00:05:22.779
and then you go through your databanks:

00:05:22.803 --> 00:05:24.625
Cell phone. Oh! That's a cell phone.

00:05:25.559 --> 00:05:27.641
If I took a bite out of it, you'd go,

00:05:27.665 --> 00:05:29.155
"Wait a second.

00:05:29.179 --> 00:05:30.334
(Laughter)

00:05:30.358 --> 00:05:31.707
"That's not a cell phone.

00:05:31.731 --> 00:05:34.631
That's one of those new
chocolate cell phones."

00:05:34.655 --> 00:05:36.369
(Laughter)

00:05:36.393 --> 00:05:38.080
You'd have to start a new category,

00:05:38.104 --> 00:05:40.166
right between cell phones and chocolate.

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:42.001
(Laughter)

00:05:42.025 --> 00:05:43.691
That's how we process information.

00:05:43.715 --> 00:05:45.847
You translate that
to the building industry.

00:05:45.871 --> 00:05:48.901
If we have a wall of windowpanes
and one pane is cracked, we go,

00:05:48.925 --> 00:05:50.950
"Oh, dear. That's cracked.
Let's repair it.

00:05:50.974 --> 00:05:53.610
Let's take it out and throw it away
so nobody can use it

00:05:53.634 --> 00:05:54.794
and put a new one in."

00:05:54.818 --> 00:05:57.040
Because that's what you do
with a cracked pane.

00:05:57.064 --> 00:05:59.524
Never mind that it doesn't
affect our lives at all.

00:05:59.548 --> 00:06:03.951
It only rattles that expected pattern
and unity of structural features.

00:06:04.356 --> 00:06:06.784
However, if we took a small hammer,

00:06:06.808 --> 00:06:09.374
and we added cracks
to all the other windows --

00:06:09.398 --> 00:06:11.399
(Laughter)

00:06:11.423 --> 00:06:12.637
then we have a pattern.

00:06:12.661 --> 00:06:15.728
Because Gestalt psychology
emphasizes recognition of pattern

00:06:15.752 --> 00:06:17.783
over parts that comprise a pattern.

00:06:17.807 --> 00:06:19.586
We'll go, "Ooh, that's nice."

00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:22.756
So, that serves me every day.

00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:24.526
Repetition creates pattern.

00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:26.349
If I have 100 of these, 100 of those,

00:06:26.373 --> 00:06:28.647
it makes no difference
what these and those are.

00:06:28.671 --> 00:06:31.593
If I can repeat anything,
I have the possibility of a pattern,

00:06:31.617 --> 00:06:34.540
from hickory nuts and chicken eggs,
shards of glass, branches.

00:06:34.564 --> 00:06:36.078
It doesn't make any difference.

00:06:36.102 --> 00:06:38.630
That causes a lot of waste
in the building industry.

00:06:38.654 --> 00:06:39.805
The second cause is,

00:06:39.829 --> 00:06:41.730
Friedrich Nietzsche, along about 1885,

00:06:41.754 --> 00:06:44.061
wrote a book titled
"The Birth of Tragedy."

00:06:44.085 --> 00:06:45.241
And in there,

00:06:45.693 --> 00:06:48.707
he said cultures tend to swing
between one of two perspectives:

00:06:48.731 --> 00:06:51.951
on the one hand,
we have an Apollonian perspective,

00:06:51.975 --> 00:06:55.754
which is very crisp and premeditated
and intellectualized

00:06:55.778 --> 00:06:57.474
and perfect.

00:06:58.481 --> 00:07:01.693
On the other end of the spectrum,
we have a Dionysian perspective,

00:07:01.717 --> 00:07:04.100
which is more given
to the passions and intuition,

00:07:04.124 --> 00:07:06.903
tolerant of organic texture
and human gesture.

00:07:06.927 --> 00:07:12.246
So the way the Apollonian personality
takes a picture or hangs a picture is,

00:07:12.270 --> 00:07:14.146
they'll get out a transit

00:07:14.170 --> 00:07:15.822
and a laser level

00:07:15.846 --> 00:07:17.016
and a micrometer.

00:07:17.550 --> 00:07:19.820
"OK, honey. A thousandth
of an inch to the left.

00:07:19.844 --> 00:07:22.227
That's where we want
the picture. Right. Perfect!"

00:07:22.251 --> 00:07:24.546
Predicated on plumb level,
square and centered.

00:07:24.882 --> 00:07:28.025
The Dionysian personality
takes the picture and goes:

00:07:28.780 --> 00:07:33.847
(Laughter)

00:07:33.871 --> 00:07:35.149
That's the difference.

00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:37.601
I feature blemish.

00:07:37.625 --> 00:07:39.681
I feature organic process.

00:07:39.705 --> 00:07:41.060
Dead center John Dewey.

00:07:41.616 --> 00:07:45.860
Apollonian mindset
creates mountains of waste.

00:07:45.884 --> 00:07:47.526
If something isn't perfect,

00:07:47.550 --> 00:07:50.380
if it doesn't line up
with that premeditated model?

00:07:50.404 --> 00:07:51.555
Dumpster.

00:07:51.579 --> 00:07:52.843
"Oops. Scratch. Dumpster."

00:07:52.867 --> 00:07:55.494
"Oops" this, "oops" that.
Landfill, landfill, landfill.

00:07:55.518 --> 00:07:58.031
The third thing is arguably --

00:07:58.649 --> 00:08:01.102
The Industrial Revolution
started in the Renaissance

00:08:01.126 --> 00:08:02.380
with the rise of humanism,

00:08:02.404 --> 00:08:05.369
then got a little jump start
along about the French Revolution.

00:08:05.393 --> 00:08:08.021
By the middle of the 19th century,
it's in full flower.

00:08:08.045 --> 00:08:10.652
And we have dumaflaches and gizmos

00:08:10.676 --> 00:08:13.921
and contraptions that will do anything

00:08:13.945 --> 00:08:15.785
that we, up to that point,

00:08:15.809 --> 00:08:17.560
had to do by hand.

00:08:17.584 --> 00:08:19.659
So now we have standardized materials.

00:08:19.683 --> 00:08:22.541
Well, trees don't grow
two inches by four inches,

00:08:22.565 --> 00:08:24.247
eight, ten and twelve feet tall.

00:08:24.271 --> 00:08:25.296
(Laughter)

00:08:25.320 --> 00:08:26.743
We create mountains of waste.

00:08:26.767 --> 00:08:30.308
And they're doing a pretty good job
there in the forest,

00:08:30.332 --> 00:08:32.824
working all the byproduct
of their industry --

00:08:32.848 --> 00:08:35.610
with OSB and particle board
and so forth and so on --

00:08:35.634 --> 00:08:37.429
but it does no good

00:08:37.453 --> 00:08:40.526
to be responsible at the point
of harvest in the forest

00:08:40.550 --> 00:08:43.909
if consumers are wasting the harvest
at the point of consumption.

00:08:43.933 --> 00:08:45.424
And that's what's happening.

00:08:45.814 --> 00:08:47.526
And so if something isn't standard,

00:08:47.550 --> 00:08:50.483
"Oops, dumpster." "Oops" this.
"Oops, warped."

00:08:50.507 --> 00:08:52.736
If you buy a two-by-four
and it's not straight,

00:08:52.760 --> 00:08:54.020
you can take it back.

00:08:54.044 --> 00:08:56.655
"Oh, I'm so sorry, sir.
We'll get you a straight one."

00:08:56.679 --> 00:08:59.971
Well, I feature all those warped things

00:08:59.995 --> 00:09:01.810
because repetition creates pattern,

00:09:01.834 --> 00:09:03.839
and it's from a Dionysian perspective.

00:09:03.863 --> 00:09:05.145
The fourth thing

00:09:05.169 --> 00:09:08.895
is labor is disproportionately
more expensive than materials.

00:09:08.919 --> 00:09:10.409
Well, that's just a myth.

00:09:10.433 --> 00:09:11.595
And there's a story:

00:09:11.619 --> 00:09:15.178
Jim Tulles, one of the guys I trained --
I said, "Jim, it's time now.

00:09:15.202 --> 00:09:18.617
I got a job for you as a foreman
on a framing crew. Time for you to go."

00:09:18.641 --> 00:09:20.392
"Dan, I just don't think I'm ready."

00:09:20.416 --> 00:09:23.382
"Jim, now it's time.
You're the down -- oh!"

00:09:23.406 --> 00:09:24.757
So we hired on.

00:09:24.781 --> 00:09:28.258
And he was out there with a tape measure,
going through the trash heap,

00:09:28.282 --> 00:09:31.382
looking for header material,
or the board that goes over a door,

00:09:31.406 --> 00:09:34.627
thinking he'd impress his boss --
that's how we taught him to do it.

00:09:34.651 --> 00:09:37.502
The superintendent walked up
and said, "What are you doing?"

00:09:37.526 --> 00:09:39.446
"Oh, just looking for header material,"

00:09:39.470 --> 00:09:40.631
waiting for that kudos.

00:09:40.655 --> 00:09:44.113
He said, "I'm not paying you to go
through the trash. Get back to work."

00:09:44.137 --> 00:09:45.845
And Jim had the wherewithal to say,

00:09:45.869 --> 00:09:49.243
"You know, if you were paying me
300 dollars an hour,

00:09:49.267 --> 00:09:51.284
I can see how you might say that.

00:09:51.308 --> 00:09:54.385
But right now, I'm saving you
five dollars a minute.

00:09:54.409 --> 00:09:55.757
Do the math."

00:09:55.781 --> 00:09:58.105
(Laughter)

00:09:58.129 --> 00:10:01.343
"Good call, Tulles. From now on,
you guys hit this pile first."

00:10:01.367 --> 00:10:03.842
And the irony is that he wasn't
very good at math.

00:10:03.866 --> 00:10:07.272
(Laughter)

00:10:07.296 --> 00:10:09.947
But once in a while,
you get access to the control room,

00:10:09.971 --> 00:10:12.080
and then you can
kind of mess with the dials.

00:10:12.104 --> 00:10:13.669
And that's what happened there.

00:10:14.438 --> 00:10:16.837
The fifth thing is that maybe,
after 2,500 years,

00:10:16.861 --> 00:10:20.179
Plato is still having his way with us
in his notion of perfect forms.

00:10:20.203 --> 00:10:24.375
He said that we have in our noggin
the perfect idea of what we want,

00:10:24.399 --> 00:10:27.376
and we force environmental
resources to accommodate that.

00:10:27.400 --> 00:10:29.858
So we all have in our head
the perfect house,

00:10:29.882 --> 00:10:32.112
the American dream, which is a house,

00:10:32.136 --> 00:10:33.723
the dream house.

00:10:33.747 --> 00:10:35.526
The problem is we can't afford it.

00:10:35.550 --> 00:10:37.526
So we have the American dream look-alike,

00:10:37.550 --> 00:10:38.862
which is a mobile home.

00:10:38.886 --> 00:10:41.176
Now there's a blight on the planet.

00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:42.454
(Laughter)

00:10:42.478 --> 00:10:44.198
It's a chattel mortgage,

00:10:44.222 --> 00:10:46.199
just like furniture, just like a car.

00:10:46.223 --> 00:10:49.355
You write the check,
and instantly, it depreciates 30 percent.

00:10:49.379 --> 00:10:52.586
After a year, you can't get insurance
on everything you have in it,

00:10:52.610 --> 00:10:53.881
only on 70 percent.

00:10:53.905 --> 00:10:55.654
Wired with 14-Gauge wire, typically.

00:10:55.678 --> 00:10:56.846
Nothing wrong with that,

00:10:56.870 --> 00:10:59.716
unless you ask it to do
what 12-Gauge wire's supposed to do,

00:10:59.740 --> 00:11:00.943
and that's what happens.

00:11:00.967 --> 00:11:02.448
It out-gasses formaldehyde --

00:11:02.472 --> 00:11:06.613
so much so that there is
a federal law in place

00:11:06.637 --> 00:11:11.201
to warn new mobile home buyers
of the formaldehyde atmosphere danger.

00:11:11.225 --> 00:11:13.271
Are we just being numbingly stupid?

00:11:13.295 --> 00:11:15.102
The walls are this thick.

00:11:15.126 --> 00:11:18.103
The whole thing has
the structural value of corn.

00:11:18.127 --> 00:11:20.010
(Laughter)

00:11:20.034 --> 00:11:22.606
"So ... I thought Palm Harbor
Village was over there."

00:11:22.630 --> 00:11:24.668
"No, no. We had a wind last night.

00:11:24.692 --> 00:11:26.264
It's gone now."

00:11:26.288 --> 00:11:29.526
(Laughter)

00:11:29.550 --> 00:11:31.951
Then when they degrade,
what do you do with them?

00:11:32.359 --> 00:11:34.063
Now, all that --

00:11:34.626 --> 00:11:37.374
that Apollonian, Platonic model --

00:11:37.398 --> 00:11:39.961
is what the building industry
is predicated on,

00:11:39.985 --> 00:11:42.661
and there are a number of things
that exacerbate that.

00:11:42.685 --> 00:11:45.203
One is that all the professionals,

00:11:45.227 --> 00:11:46.894
all the tradesmen, vendors,

00:11:46.918 --> 00:11:49.296
inspectors, engineers, architects

00:11:49.320 --> 00:11:50.966
all think like this.

00:11:51.438 --> 00:11:53.644
And then it works its way
back to the consumer,

00:11:53.668 --> 00:11:55.112
who demands the same model.

00:11:55.136 --> 00:11:57.955
It's a self-fulfilling prophecy.
We can't get out of it.

00:11:58.271 --> 00:12:00.847
Then here come the marketeers
and the advertisers.

00:12:00.871 --> 00:12:03.295
"Woo. Woo-hoo."

00:12:03.319 --> 00:12:06.526
We buy stuff we didn't know we needed.

00:12:06.550 --> 00:12:09.082
All we have to do
is look at what one company did

00:12:09.106 --> 00:12:11.097
with carbonated prune juice.

00:12:11.121 --> 00:12:12.526
How disgusting.

00:12:12.550 --> 00:12:14.342
(Laughter)

00:12:14.366 --> 00:12:15.674
But you know what they did?

00:12:15.698 --> 00:12:18.774
They hooked a metaphor into it
and said, "I drink Dr. Pepper ..."

00:12:18.798 --> 00:12:21.792
And pretty soon, we're swilling
that stuff by the lake-ful,

00:12:21.816 --> 00:12:23.527
by the billions of gallons.

00:12:23.551 --> 00:12:26.688
It doesn't even have real prunes!
Doesn't even keep you regular.

00:12:26.712 --> 00:12:28.472
(Laughter)

00:12:28.496 --> 00:12:30.526
My oh my, that makes it worse.

00:12:30.550 --> 00:12:33.746
And we get sucked
into that faster than anything.

00:12:33.770 --> 00:12:36.479
Then, a man named
Jean-Paul Sartre wrote a book

00:12:36.503 --> 00:12:37.988
titled "Being and Nothingness."

00:12:38.012 --> 00:12:40.934
It's a pretty quick read.
You can snap through it in maybe --

00:12:40.958 --> 00:12:42.022
(Laughter)

00:12:42.046 --> 00:12:43.198
maybe two years,

00:12:43.222 --> 00:12:44.954
if you read eight hours a day.

00:12:45.550 --> 00:12:47.863
In there, he talked
about the divided self.

00:12:47.887 --> 00:12:50.965
He said human beings act differently
when they know they're alone

00:12:50.989 --> 00:12:53.049
than when they know
somebody else is around.

00:12:53.073 --> 00:12:55.375
So if I'm eating spaghetti,
and I know I'm alone,

00:12:55.399 --> 00:12:56.867
I can eat like a backhoe.

00:12:56.891 --> 00:13:00.105
I can wipe my mouth on my sleeve,
napkin on the table,

00:13:00.129 --> 00:13:03.446
chew with my mouth open,
make little noises,

00:13:03.470 --> 00:13:05.447
scratch wherever I want.

00:13:05.471 --> 00:13:07.331
(Laughter)

00:13:07.355 --> 00:13:08.802
But as soon as you walk in,

00:13:08.826 --> 00:13:11.304
I go, "Oops! Lil' spaghetti sauce there."

00:13:11.328 --> 00:13:13.181
Napkin in my lap, half-bites,

00:13:13.205 --> 00:13:15.438
chew with my mouth closed, no scratching.

00:13:15.462 --> 00:13:20.397
Now, what I'm doing
is fulfilling your expectations

00:13:20.421 --> 00:13:22.303
of how I should live my life.

00:13:23.819 --> 00:13:25.601
I feel that expectation,

00:13:25.625 --> 00:13:27.041
and so I accommodate it,

00:13:27.065 --> 00:13:30.311
and I'm living my life according
to what you expect me to do.

00:13:30.335 --> 00:13:32.606
That happens in the building
industry as well.

00:13:32.630 --> 00:13:35.485
That's why all subdivisions look the same.

00:13:35.509 --> 00:13:39.625
Sometimes, we even have
these formalized cultural expectations.

00:13:39.649 --> 00:13:41.526
I'll bet all your shoes match.

00:13:41.550 --> 00:13:43.735
Sure enough, we all buy into that ...

00:13:43.759 --> 00:13:45.409
(Laughter)

00:13:45.433 --> 00:13:47.858
And with gated communities,

00:13:47.882 --> 00:13:50.258
we have a formalized expectation,

00:13:50.282 --> 00:13:51.860
with a homeowners' association.

00:13:51.884 --> 00:13:53.582
Sometimes those guys are Nazis,

00:13:53.606 --> 00:13:54.953
my oh my.

00:13:55.930 --> 00:13:58.906
That exacerbates and continues this model.

00:13:59.712 --> 00:14:01.619
The last thing is gregariousness.

00:14:02.408 --> 00:14:04.321
Human beings are a social species.

00:14:04.345 --> 00:14:07.043
We like to hang together in groups,

00:14:07.067 --> 00:14:08.947
just like wildebeests, just like lions.

00:14:08.971 --> 00:14:10.627
Wildebeests don't hang with lions,

00:14:10.651 --> 00:14:12.301
because lions eat wildebeests.

00:14:12.690 --> 00:14:14.136
Human beings are like that.

00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:16.256
We do what that group does

00:14:16.280 --> 00:14:18.136
that we're trying to identify with.

00:14:18.682 --> 00:14:20.665
You see this in junior high a lot.

00:14:21.291 --> 00:14:25.662
Those kids, they'll work
all summer long -- kill themselves --

00:14:25.686 --> 00:14:29.894
so that they can afford
one pair of designer jeans.

00:14:29.918 --> 00:14:32.176
So along about September,

00:14:32.200 --> 00:14:34.177
they can stride in and go,

00:14:34.201 --> 00:14:38.415
"I'm important today. See?
Don't touch my designer jeans!

00:14:38.439 --> 00:14:41.276
I see you don't have designer jeans.

00:14:41.300 --> 00:14:44.996
You're not one of the beautiful --
See, I'm one of the beautiful people.

00:14:45.020 --> 00:14:46.208
See my jeans?"

00:14:46.232 --> 00:14:48.618
Right there is reason
enough to have uniforms.

00:14:49.185 --> 00:14:52.219
And so that happens
in the building industry as well.

00:14:52.678 --> 00:14:56.897
We have confused
Maslow's hierarchy of needs,

00:14:56.921 --> 00:14:58.526
just a little bit.

00:14:58.550 --> 00:15:01.904
On the bottom tier, we have basic needs:

00:15:01.928 --> 00:15:05.462
shelter, clothing, food,
water, mating and so forth.

00:15:05.486 --> 00:15:07.824
Second: security. Third: relationships.

00:15:07.848 --> 00:15:10.866
Fourth: status, self-esteem --
that is, vanity --

00:15:10.890 --> 00:15:13.488
and we're taking vanity
and shoving it down here.

00:15:14.343 --> 00:15:15.749
And so we end up

00:15:16.827 --> 00:15:18.803
with vain decisions,

00:15:19.605 --> 00:15:21.797
and we can't even afford our mortgage.

00:15:21.821 --> 00:15:24.575
We can't afford to eat
anything except beans;

00:15:24.599 --> 00:15:28.170
that is, our housing
has become a commodity.

00:15:28.813 --> 00:15:31.472
And it takes a little bit of nerve

00:15:32.123 --> 00:15:34.526
to dive into those primal,

00:15:34.550 --> 00:15:36.753
terrifying parts of ourselves

00:15:37.550 --> 00:15:39.494
and make our own decisions

00:15:40.002 --> 00:15:41.979
and not make our housing a commodity,

00:15:42.003 --> 00:15:45.526
but make it something
that bubbles up from seminal sources.

00:15:45.550 --> 00:15:47.327
That takes a little bit of nerve,

00:15:47.351 --> 00:15:50.076
and, darn it, once in a while, you fail.

00:15:50.973 --> 00:15:52.764
But that's okay.

00:15:53.180 --> 00:15:54.968
If failure destroys you,

00:15:54.992 --> 00:15:56.222
then you can't do this.

00:15:56.246 --> 00:15:58.752
I fail all the time, every day,

00:15:58.776 --> 00:16:02.488
and I've had some whopping
failures, I promise --

00:16:02.512 --> 00:16:05.526
big, public, humiliating,
embarrassing failures.

00:16:05.550 --> 00:16:06.990
Everybody points and laughs,

00:16:07.014 --> 00:16:10.110
and they say, "He tried it a fifth time,
and it still didn't work!

00:16:10.134 --> 00:16:11.514
What a moron!"

00:16:11.538 --> 00:16:13.526
Early on, contractors come by and say,

00:16:13.550 --> 00:16:15.313
"Dan, you're a cute little bunny,

00:16:15.337 --> 00:16:17.495
but you know,
this just isn't going to work.

00:16:17.519 --> 00:16:19.850
What don't you do this?
Why don't you do that?"

00:16:19.874 --> 00:16:22.380
And your instinct is to say,

00:16:22.404 --> 00:16:24.071
"Well, why don't you suck an egg?"

00:16:24.095 --> 00:16:25.526
(Laughter)

00:16:25.550 --> 00:16:27.214
But you don't say that,

00:16:27.238 --> 00:16:29.344
because they're the guys you're targeting.

00:16:30.191 --> 00:16:33.170
And so what we've done --

00:16:33.194 --> 00:16:36.587
and this isn't just in housing;
it's in clothing and food

00:16:36.611 --> 00:16:39.464
and our transportation
needs, our energy --

00:16:39.488 --> 00:16:42.063
we sprawl just a little bit.

00:16:42.996 --> 00:16:45.526
And when I get a little bit of press,

00:16:45.550 --> 00:16:47.510
I hear from people all over the world.

00:16:47.859 --> 00:16:50.678
And we may have invented excess,

00:16:50.702 --> 00:16:54.119
but the problem of waste is worldwide.

00:16:55.184 --> 00:16:58.161
We're in trouble.

00:16:58.185 --> 00:17:01.239
And I don't wear ammo belts
crisscrossing my chest

00:17:01.263 --> 00:17:02.633
and a red bandana.

00:17:03.375 --> 00:17:04.995
But we're clearly in trouble.

00:17:05.598 --> 00:17:09.526
And what we need to do is reconnect

00:17:09.550 --> 00:17:13.187
with those really primal
parts of ourselves

00:17:13.211 --> 00:17:15.257
and make some decisions and say,

00:17:15.281 --> 00:17:20.010
"You know, I think I would like to put
CDs across the wall there.

00:17:20.034 --> 00:17:21.398
What do you think, honey?"

00:17:22.011 --> 00:17:23.706
If it doesn't work, take it down.

00:17:24.859 --> 00:17:27.835
What we need to do is reconnect
with who we really are,

00:17:28.462 --> 00:17:30.438
and that's thrilling indeed.

00:17:31.483 --> 00:17:32.666
Thank you very much.

00:17:32.690 --> 00:17:36.550
(Applause)
