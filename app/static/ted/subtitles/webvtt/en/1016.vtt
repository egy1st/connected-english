00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Hello. My name is Birke Baehr,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
and I'm 11 years old.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
I came here today to talk about what's wrong with our food system.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
First of all, I would like to say

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
that I'm really amazed at how easily kids are led to believe

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
all the marketing and advertising

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
on TV, at public schools

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
and pretty much everywhere else you look.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
It seems to me like corporations

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
are always trying to get kids, like me,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
to get their parents to buy stuff

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
that really isn't good for us or the planet.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Little kids, especially,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
are attracted by colorful packaging

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
and plastic toys.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
I must admit, I used to be one of them.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
I also used to think that all of our food

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
came from these happy, little farms

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
where pigs rolled in mud and cows grazed on grass all day.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
What I discovered was this is not true.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
I began to look into this stuff

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
on the Internet, in books and in documentary films,

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
in my travels with my family.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
I discovered the dark side of the industrialized food system.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
First, there's genetically engineered seeds and organisms.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
That is when a seed is manipulated in a laboratory

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
to do something not intended by nature --

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
like taking the DNA of a fish

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
and putting it into the DNA of a tomato. Yuck.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
Don't get me wrong, I like fish and tomatoes,

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
but this is just creepy.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
(Laughter)

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
The seeds are then planted, then grown.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
The food they produce have been proven

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
to cause cancer and other problems in lab animals,

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
and people have been eating food produced this way

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
since the 1990s.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
And most folks don't even know they exist.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
Did you know rats that ate genetically engineered corn

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000
had developed signs of liver and kidney toxicity?

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
These include kidney inflammation and lesions and increased kidney weight.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
Yet almost all the corn we eat

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
has been altered genetically in some way.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
And let me tell you,

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
corn is in everything.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
And don't even get me started on the Confined Animal Feeding Operations

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
called CAFOS.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
(Laughter)

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
Conventional farmers use chemical fertilizers

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
made from fossil fuels

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
that they mix with the dirt to make plants grow.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
They do this because they've stripped the soil from all nutrients

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
from growing the same crop over and over again.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
Next, more harmful chemicals are sprayed on fruits and vegetables,

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
like pesticides and herbicides,

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
to kill weeds and bugs.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000
When it rains, these chemicals seep into the ground,

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
or run off into our waterways,

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
poisoning our water too.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
Then they irradiate our food, trying to make it last longer,

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
so it can travel thousands of miles

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
from where it's grown to the supermarkets.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
So I ask myself,

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
how can I change? How can I change these things?

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
This is what I found out.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000
I discovered that there's a movement for a better way.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
Now a while back,

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
I wanted to be an NFL football player.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
I decided that I'd rather be an organic farmer instead.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:51.000
(Applause)

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
Thank you.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000
And that way I can have a greater impact on the world.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000
This man, Joel Salatin, they call him a lunatic farmer

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
because he grows against the system.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000
Since I'm home-schooled,

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000
I went to go hear him speak one day.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000
This man, this "lunatic farmer,"

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
doesn't use any pesticides, herbicides,

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000
or genetically modified seeds.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000
And so for that, he's called crazy by the system.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000
I want you to know that we can all make a difference

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000
by making different choices,

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000
by buying our food directly from local farmers,

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
or our neighbors who we know in real life.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
Some people say organic or local food is more expensive,

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
but is it really?

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.000
With all these things I've been learning about the food system,

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.000
it seems to me that we can either pay the farmer,

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000
or we can pay the hospital.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:43.000
(Applause)

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000
Now I know definitely which one I would choose.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000
I want you to know that there are farms out there --

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.000
like Bill Keener in Sequatchie Cove Farm in Tennessee --

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000
whose cows do eat grass

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000
and whose pigs do roll in the mud, just like I thought.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000
Sometimes I go to Bill's farm and volunteer,

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000
so I can see up close and personal

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000
where the meat I eat comes from.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
I want you to know that I believe

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000
kids will eat fresh vegetables and good food

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.000
if they know more about it and where it really comes from.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000
I want you to know that there are farmers' markets

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000
in every community popping up.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000
I want you to know that me, my brother and sister

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000
actually like eating baked kale chips.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000
I try to share this everywhere I go.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000
Not too long ago,

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.000
my uncle said that he offered my six-year-old cousin cereal.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.000
He asked him if he wanted organic Toasted O's

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000
or the sugarcoated flakes --

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000
you know, the one with the big striped cartoon character on the front.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000
My little cousin told his dad

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000
that he would rather have the organic Toasted O's cereal

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.000
because Birke said he shouldn't eat sparkly cereal.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000
And that, my friends, is how we can make a difference

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000
one kid at a time.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.000
So next time you're at the grocery store, think local,

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000
choose organic, know your farmer and know your food.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000
Thank you.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.000
(Applause)
