00:00:00.809 --> 00:00:03.174
Well, the subject of difficult negotiation

00:00:03.198 --> 00:00:06.976
reminds me of one of my favorite stories
from the Middle East,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.754
of a man who left
to his three sons, 17 camels.

00:00:10.778 --> 00:00:12.976
To the first son, he left half the camels;

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.390
to the second son,
he left a third of the camels;

00:00:15.414 --> 00:00:18.009
and to the youngest son,
he left a ninth of the camels.

00:00:18.033 --> 00:00:21.847
The three sons got into a negotiation --
17 doesn't divide by two.

00:00:21.871 --> 00:00:23.609
It doesn't divide by three.

00:00:23.633 --> 00:00:25.172
It doesn't divide by nine.

00:00:25.196 --> 00:00:27.442
Brotherly tempers started to get strained.

00:00:27.466 --> 00:00:28.745
Finally, in desperation,

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:32.430
they went and they consulted
a wise old woman.

00:00:32.454 --> 00:00:35.429
The wise old woman thought
about their problem for a long time,

00:00:35.453 --> 00:00:38.957
and finally she came back and said,
"Well, I don't know if I can help you,

00:00:38.981 --> 00:00:41.358
but at least, if you want,
you can have my camel."

00:00:41.382 --> 00:00:42.850
So then, they had 18 camels.

00:00:42.874 --> 00:00:45.732
The first son took his half --
half of 18 is nine.

00:00:45.756 --> 00:00:48.450
The second son took his third --
a third of 18 is six.

00:00:48.474 --> 00:00:51.976
The youngest son took his ninth --
a ninth of 18 is two.

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:54.559
You get 17.

00:00:54.583 --> 00:00:56.393
They had one camel left over.

00:00:56.417 --> 00:00:58.345
They gave it back to the wise old woman.

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:59.976
(Laughter)

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.239
Now, if you think
about that story for a moment,

00:01:02.263 --> 00:01:05.834
I think it resembles a lot
of the difficult negotiations

00:01:05.858 --> 00:01:07.072
we get involved in.

00:01:07.096 --> 00:01:09.572
They start off like 17 camels,
no way to resolve it.

00:01:09.596 --> 00:01:11.032
Somehow, what we need to do

00:01:11.056 --> 00:01:14.737
is step back from those situations,
like that wise old woman,

00:01:14.761 --> 00:01:16.793
look at the situation through fresh eyes

00:01:16.817 --> 00:01:18.754
and come up with an 18th camel.

00:01:19.873 --> 00:01:22.639
Finding that 18th camel
in the world's conflicts

00:01:22.663 --> 00:01:24.821
has been my life passion.

00:01:24.845 --> 00:01:27.976
I basically see humanity
a bit like those three brothers.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:29.590
We're all one family.

00:01:30.145 --> 00:01:32.094
We know that scientifically,

00:01:32.118 --> 00:01:34.064
thanks to the communications revolution,

00:01:34.088 --> 00:01:37.656
all the tribes on the planet --
all 15,000 tribes --

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.291
are in touch with each other.

00:01:40.283 --> 00:01:42.676
And it's a big family reunion.

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:44.382
And yet, like many family reunions,

00:01:44.406 --> 00:01:46.629
it's not all peace and light.

00:01:46.653 --> 00:01:48.554
There's a lot of conflict,

00:01:48.578 --> 00:01:51.976
and the question is:
How do we deal with our differences?

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.096
How do we deal with
our deepest differences,

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:56.829
given the human propensity for conflict

00:01:56.853 --> 00:02:01.380
and the human genius at devising
weapons of enormous destruction?

00:02:01.404 --> 00:02:03.153
That's the question.

00:02:03.177 --> 00:02:07.976
As I've spent the last better part
of three decades, almost four,

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.055
traveling the world,

00:02:10.079 --> 00:02:13.448
trying to work, getting
involved in conflicts

00:02:13.472 --> 00:02:16.852
ranging from Yugoslavia to the Middle East

00:02:16.876 --> 00:02:18.600
to Chechnya to Venezuela --

00:02:18.624 --> 00:02:21.697
some of the most difficult conflicts
on the face of the planet --

00:02:21.721 --> 00:02:23.812
I've been asking myself that question.

00:02:23.836 --> 00:02:27.232
And I think I've found, in some ways,
what is the secret to peace.

00:02:27.256 --> 00:02:29.976
It's actually surprisingly simple.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.176
It's not easy, but it's simple.

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:34.431
It's not even new.

00:02:34.455 --> 00:02:37.829
It may be one of our most
ancient human heritages.

00:02:37.853 --> 00:02:40.170
The secret to peace is us.

00:02:40.662 --> 00:02:45.804
It's us who act as a surrounding
community around any conflict,

00:02:45.828 --> 00:02:47.976
who can play a constructive role.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
Let me give you just a story, an example.

00:02:51.944 --> 00:02:53.096
About 20 years ago,

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:56.361
I was in South Africa,
working with the parties in that conflict,

00:02:56.385 --> 00:02:57.648
and I had an extra month,

00:02:57.672 --> 00:03:02.238
so I spent some time living
with several groups of San Bushmen.

00:03:02.262 --> 00:03:06.206
I was curious about them, about the way
in which they resolve conflict.

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:09.976
Because, after all, within living memory,
they were hunters and gatherers,

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.356
living pretty much
like our ancestors lived

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:14.642
for maybe 99 percent of the human story.

00:03:15.213 --> 00:03:18.576
And all the men have these poison arrows
that they use for hunting --

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:20.118
absolutely fatal.

00:03:20.142 --> 00:03:22.436
So how do they deal
with their differences?

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:27.049
Well, what I learned is, whenever
tempers rise in those communities,

00:03:27.073 --> 00:03:30.644
someone goes and hides
the poison arrows out in the bush,

00:03:30.668 --> 00:03:34.303
and then everyone sits around
in a circle like this,

00:03:34.327 --> 00:03:37.279
and they sit and they talk and they talk.

00:03:37.303 --> 00:03:39.614
It may take two days,
three days, four days,

00:03:39.638 --> 00:03:42.976
but they don't rest
until they find a resolution

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.976
or better yet -- a reconciliation.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.033
And if tempers are still too high,

00:03:47.057 --> 00:03:49.596
then they send someone
off to visit some relatives,

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:50.976
as a cooling-off period.

00:03:51.398 --> 00:03:54.383
Well, that system is, I think,
probably the system

00:03:54.407 --> 00:03:56.143
that kept us alive to this point,

00:03:56.167 --> 00:03:57.976
given our human tendencies.

00:03:58.841 --> 00:04:02.032
That system, I call "the third side."

00:04:02.056 --> 00:04:05.175
Because if you think about it,
normally when we think of conflict,

00:04:05.199 --> 00:04:06.350
when we describe it,

00:04:06.374 --> 00:04:07.747
there's always two sides --

00:04:07.771 --> 00:04:10.477
it's Arabs versus Israelis,
labor versus management,

00:04:10.501 --> 00:04:13.652
husband versus wife,
Republicans versus Democrats.

00:04:13.676 --> 00:04:15.461
But what we don't often see

00:04:15.485 --> 00:04:17.851
is that there's always a third side,

00:04:17.875 --> 00:04:21.547
and the third side of the conflict is us,
it's the surrounding community,

00:04:21.571 --> 00:04:22.976
it's the friends, the allies,

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:24.808
the family members, the neighbors.

00:04:24.832 --> 00:04:27.760
And we can play
an incredibly constructive role.

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:33.035
Perhaps the most fundamental way
in which the third side can help

00:04:33.059 --> 00:04:35.976
is to remind the parties
of what's really at stake.

00:04:36.336 --> 00:04:38.840
For the sake of the kids,
for the sake of the family,

00:04:38.864 --> 00:04:41.634
for the sake of the community,
for the sake of the future,

00:04:41.658 --> 00:04:44.099
let's stop fighting for a moment
and start talking.

00:04:44.806 --> 00:04:46.281
Because, the thing is,

00:04:46.305 --> 00:04:47.878
when we're involved in conflict,

00:04:47.902 --> 00:04:50.461
it's very easy to lose perspective.

00:04:50.485 --> 00:04:52.524
It's very easy to react.

00:04:52.548 --> 00:04:55.421
Human beings -- we're reaction machines.

00:04:55.445 --> 00:04:56.818
And as the saying goes,

00:04:56.842 --> 00:04:59.365
when angry, you will make the best speech

00:04:59.389 --> 00:05:00.874
you will ever regret.

00:05:00.898 --> 00:05:02.556
(Laughter)

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:05.576
And so the third side reminds us of that.

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:07.625
The third side helps us go to the balcony,

00:05:07.649 --> 00:05:10.355
which is a metaphor
for a place of perspective,

00:05:10.379 --> 00:05:12.785
where we can keep our eyes on the prize.

00:05:12.809 --> 00:05:16.389
Let me tell you a little story
from my own negotiating experience.

00:05:16.413 --> 00:05:21.484
Some years ago, I was involved
as a facilitator in some very tough talks

00:05:21.508 --> 00:05:24.731
between the leaders of Russia
and the leaders of Chechnya.

00:05:25.429 --> 00:05:27.406
There was a war going on, as you know.

00:05:27.795 --> 00:05:30.976
And we met in the Hague,
in the Peace Palace,

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:36.107
in the same room where the Yugoslav
war-crimes tribunal was taking place.

00:05:36.131 --> 00:05:39.003
And the talks got off
to a rather rocky start

00:05:39.027 --> 00:05:42.435
when the vice president of Chechnya
began by pointing at the Russians

00:05:42.459 --> 00:05:44.976
and said, "You should stay
right here in your seats,

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.811
because you're going
to be on trial for war crimes."

00:05:47.835 --> 00:05:49.645
And then he turned to me and said,

00:05:49.669 --> 00:05:50.851
"You're an American.

00:05:50.875 --> 00:05:54.101
Look at what you Americans
are doing in Puerto Rico."

00:05:54.125 --> 00:05:57.748
And my mind started racing, "Puerto Rico?
What do I know about Puerto Rico?"

00:05:57.772 --> 00:05:58.924
I started reacting.

00:05:58.948 --> 00:05:59.949
(Laughter)

00:05:59.973 --> 00:06:02.809
But then, I tried to remember
to go to the balcony.

00:06:02.833 --> 00:06:04.031
And then when he paused

00:06:04.055 --> 00:06:06.136
and everyone looked at me for a response,

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:09.538
from a balcony perspective,
I was able to thank him for his remarks

00:06:09.562 --> 00:06:12.339
and say, "I appreciate
your criticism of my country

00:06:12.363 --> 00:06:14.810
and I take it as a sign
that we're among friends

00:06:14.834 --> 00:06:16.725
and can speak candidly to one another."

00:06:16.749 --> 00:06:17.750
(Laughter)

00:06:17.774 --> 00:06:21.155
"And what we're here to do is not
to talk about Puerto Rico or the past.

00:06:21.179 --> 00:06:23.360
We're here to see
if we can figure out a way

00:06:23.384 --> 00:06:25.976
to stop the suffering
and the bloodshed in Chechnya."

00:06:26.851 --> 00:06:29.166
The conversation got back on track.

00:06:29.190 --> 00:06:30.849
That's the role of the third side,

00:06:30.873 --> 00:06:32.954
to help the parties go to the balcony.

00:06:33.822 --> 00:06:36.049
Now let me take you, for a moment,

00:06:36.073 --> 00:06:39.138
to what's widely regarded as the world's
most difficult conflict,

00:06:39.162 --> 00:06:41.703
or the most impossible conflict,
the Middle East.

00:06:41.727 --> 00:06:44.976
Question is: where's the third side there?

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.164
How could we possibly go to the balcony?

00:06:47.505 --> 00:06:51.482
Now, I don't pretend to have an answer
to the Middle East conflict,

00:06:51.506 --> 00:06:55.466
but I think I've got a first step --
literally, a first step --

00:06:55.490 --> 00:06:58.477
something that any one of us
could do as third-siders.

00:06:58.501 --> 00:07:00.708
Let me just ask you one question first.

00:07:00.732 --> 00:07:04.725
How many of you in the last years

00:07:04.749 --> 00:07:07.784
have ever found yourself
worrying about the Middle East

00:07:07.808 --> 00:07:09.560
and wondering what anyone could do?

00:07:09.584 --> 00:07:11.701
Just out of curiosity, how many of you?

00:07:11.725 --> 00:07:14.217
OK, so the great majority of us.

00:07:14.717 --> 00:07:16.321
And here, it's so far away.

00:07:16.345 --> 00:07:19.261
Why do we pay so much attention
to this conflict?

00:07:19.285 --> 00:07:20.976
Is it the number of deaths?

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.397
There are a hundred times more people
who die in a conflict in Africa

00:07:24.421 --> 00:07:25.572
than in the Middle East.

00:07:25.596 --> 00:07:27.683
No, it's because of the story,

00:07:27.707 --> 00:07:31.415
because we feel personally
involved in that story.

00:07:31.439 --> 00:07:35.268
Whether we're Christians, Muslims or Jews,
religious or non-religious,

00:07:35.292 --> 00:07:37.165
we feel we have a personal stake in it.

00:07:37.189 --> 00:07:38.340
Stories matter;

00:07:38.364 --> 00:07:40.122
as an anthropologist, I know that.

00:07:40.146 --> 00:07:43.764
Stories are what we use
to transmit knowledge.

00:07:43.788 --> 00:07:45.309
They give meaning to our lives.

00:07:45.333 --> 00:07:48.030
That's what we tell here
at TED, we tell stories.

00:07:48.054 --> 00:07:49.208
Stories are the key.

00:07:49.232 --> 00:07:51.803
And so my question is --

00:07:52.470 --> 00:07:56.646
yes, let's try and resolve the politics
there in the Middle East,

00:07:56.670 --> 00:07:59.194
but let's also take a look at the story.

00:07:59.218 --> 00:08:01.662
Let's try to get at the root
of what it's all about.

00:08:01.686 --> 00:08:03.906
Let's see if we can apply
the third side to it.

00:08:03.930 --> 00:08:06.734
What would that mean?
What is the story there?

00:08:06.758 --> 00:08:10.976
Now, as anthropologists, we know
that every culture has an origin story.

00:08:11.496 --> 00:08:13.597
What's the origin story
of the Middle East?

00:08:13.621 --> 00:08:14.976
In a phrase, it's:

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:16.591
Four thousand years ago,

00:08:16.615 --> 00:08:20.605
a man and his family walked
across the Middle East,

00:08:20.629 --> 00:08:23.200
and the world has never
been the same since.

00:08:23.811 --> 00:08:26.246
That man, of course, was Abraham.

00:08:27.309 --> 00:08:30.976
And what he stood for was unity,
the unity of the family;

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:32.976
he's the father of us all.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.989
But it's not just what he stood for,
it's what his message was.

00:08:36.013 --> 00:08:37.976
His basic message was unity too,

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:41.210
the interconnectedness of it all,
the unity of it all.

00:08:41.234 --> 00:08:44.544
And his basic value was respect,

00:08:44.568 --> 00:08:46.436
was kindness toward strangers.

00:08:46.460 --> 00:08:49.477
That's what he's known for,
his hospitality.

00:08:50.048 --> 00:08:51.675
So in that sense,

00:08:51.699 --> 00:08:55.659
he's the symbolic third side
of the Middle East.

00:08:55.683 --> 00:09:00.106
He's the one who reminds us
that we're all part of a greater whole.

00:09:00.447 --> 00:09:03.740
Now, think about that for a moment.

00:09:04.414 --> 00:09:06.862
Today, we face the scourge of terrorism.

00:09:07.291 --> 00:09:08.569
What is terrorism?

00:09:09.148 --> 00:09:12.407
Terrorism is basically
taking an innocent stranger

00:09:12.431 --> 00:09:16.976
and treating them as an enemy
whom you kill in order to create fear.

00:09:17.603 --> 00:09:19.389
What's the opposite of terrorism?

00:09:19.976 --> 00:09:21.696
It's taking an innocent stranger

00:09:21.720 --> 00:09:26.107
and treating them as a friend
whom you welcome into your home,

00:09:26.131 --> 00:09:28.823
in order to sow and create understanding

00:09:28.847 --> 00:09:30.635
or respect, or love.

00:09:31.593 --> 00:09:36.253
So what if, then, you took
the story of Abraham,

00:09:36.277 --> 00:09:37.910
which is a third-side story,

00:09:37.934 --> 00:09:39.976
what if that could be --

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:43.321
because Abraham stands for hospitality --

00:09:43.345 --> 00:09:46.559
what if that could be
an antidote to terrorism?

00:09:46.583 --> 00:09:50.405
What if that could be a vaccine
against religious intolerance?

00:09:50.429 --> 00:09:52.976
How would you bring that story to life?

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.762
Now, it's not enough just to tell a story.

00:09:55.786 --> 00:09:59.180
That's powerful, but people need
to experience the story.

00:09:59.204 --> 00:10:01.158
They need to be able to live the story.

00:10:01.182 --> 00:10:02.458
How would you do that?

00:10:02.482 --> 00:10:04.976
And that was my thinking
of how would you do that.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.143
And that's what comes
to the first step here.

00:10:07.167 --> 00:10:09.890
Because the simple way to do that is:

00:10:09.914 --> 00:10:11.699
you go for a walk.

00:10:11.723 --> 00:10:15.138
You go for a walk
in the footsteps of Abraham.

00:10:15.162 --> 00:10:18.090
You retrace the footsteps of Abraham.

00:10:18.114 --> 00:10:21.023
Because walking has a real power.

00:10:21.410 --> 00:10:24.467
You know, as an anthropologist,
walking is what made us human.

00:10:24.491 --> 00:10:28.686
It's funny -- when you walk,
you walk side-by-side,

00:10:28.710 --> 00:10:30.976
in the same common direction.

00:10:31.352 --> 00:10:33.413
Now if I were to come to you face-to-face

00:10:33.437 --> 00:10:35.683
and come this close to you,

00:10:35.707 --> 00:10:39.106
you would feel threatened.

00:10:39.717 --> 00:10:41.772
But if I walk shoulder-to-shoulder,

00:10:41.796 --> 00:10:43.677
even touching shoulders,

00:10:43.701 --> 00:10:44.976
it's no problem.

00:10:45.408 --> 00:10:46.976
Who fights while they walk?

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.976
That's why in negotiations,
often, when things get tough,

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.395
people go for walks in the woods.

00:10:52.419 --> 00:10:57.841
So the idea came to me
of, what about inspiring a path,

00:10:57.865 --> 00:11:01.503
a route -- think the Silk Route,
think the Appalachian Trail --

00:11:01.527 --> 00:11:05.753
that followed in the footsteps of Abraham?

00:11:05.777 --> 00:11:07.602
People said, "That's crazy. You can't.

00:11:07.626 --> 00:11:10.638
You can't retrace the footsteps
of Abraham -- it's too insecure,

00:11:10.662 --> 00:11:12.520
you've got to cross all these borders,

00:11:12.544 --> 00:11:15.226
it goes across 10 different countries
in the Middle East,

00:11:15.250 --> 00:11:16.647
because it unites them all."

00:11:17.090 --> 00:11:18.926
And so we studied the idea at Harvard.

00:11:18.950 --> 00:11:20.180
We did our due diligence.

00:11:20.204 --> 00:11:21.403
And then a few years ago,

00:11:21.427 --> 00:11:24.157
a group of us, about 25 of us
from 10 different countries,

00:11:24.181 --> 00:11:27.361
decided to see if we could retrace
the footsteps of Abraham,

00:11:27.385 --> 00:11:29.885
going from his initial birthplace
in the city of Urfa

00:11:29.909 --> 00:11:32.080
in Southern Turkey, Northern Mesopotamia.

00:11:32.588 --> 00:11:35.548
And we then took a bus and took some walks

00:11:35.572 --> 00:11:39.729
and went to Harran, where, in the Bible,
he sets off on his journey.

00:11:39.753 --> 00:11:42.306
Then we crossed the border
into Syria, went to Aleppo,

00:11:42.330 --> 00:11:44.678
which, turns out, is named after Abraham.

00:11:44.702 --> 00:11:45.976
We went to Damascus,

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.744
which has a long history
associated with Abraham.

00:11:48.768 --> 00:11:51.530
We then came to Northern Jordan,

00:11:51.554 --> 00:11:56.580
to Jerusalem -- which is all
about Abraham -- to Bethlehem,

00:11:56.604 --> 00:11:59.975
and finally, to the place
where he's buried, in Hebron.

00:11:59.999 --> 00:12:02.282
So effectively, we went from womb to tomb.

00:12:02.306 --> 00:12:03.607
We showed it could be done.

00:12:03.631 --> 00:12:05.000
It was an amazing journey.

00:12:05.334 --> 00:12:06.976
Let me ask you a question.

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:11.363
How many of you have had the experience
of being in a strange neighborhood

00:12:11.387 --> 00:12:13.603
or strange land,

00:12:13.627 --> 00:12:16.792
and a total stranger, perfect stranger,

00:12:16.816 --> 00:12:19.538
comes up to you
and shows you some kindness --

00:12:19.562 --> 00:12:22.061
maybe invites you into their home,
gives you a drink,

00:12:22.085 --> 00:12:23.864
gives you a coffee, gives you a meal?

00:12:23.888 --> 00:12:26.058
How many of you have ever
had that experience?

00:12:26.082 --> 00:12:28.873
That's the essence of the Abraham Path.

00:12:28.897 --> 00:12:32.414
That's what you discover as you go
into these villages in the Middle East

00:12:32.438 --> 00:12:33.773
where you expect hostility,

00:12:33.797 --> 00:12:36.344
and you get the most amazing hospitality,

00:12:36.368 --> 00:12:37.777
all associated with Abraham:

00:12:37.801 --> 00:12:41.561
"In the name of Father Ibrahim,
let me offer you some food."

00:12:41.585 --> 00:12:42.768
So what we discovered

00:12:42.792 --> 00:12:46.000
is that Abraham is not just a figure
out of a book for those people;

00:12:46.024 --> 00:12:49.180
he's alive, he's a living presence.

00:12:49.204 --> 00:12:51.331
And to make a long story short,

00:12:51.355 --> 00:12:53.417
in the last couple of years now,

00:12:53.441 --> 00:12:58.277
thousands of people have begun to walk
parts of the path of Abraham

00:12:58.301 --> 00:12:59.634
in the Middle East,

00:12:59.658 --> 00:13:02.713
enjoying the hospitality
of the people there.

00:13:02.737 --> 00:13:05.976
They've begun to walk
in Israel and Palestine,

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.720
in Jordan, in Turkey, in Syria.

00:13:08.744 --> 00:13:10.053
It's an amazing experience.

00:13:10.077 --> 00:13:12.362
Men, women, young people, old people --

00:13:12.386 --> 00:13:15.217
more women than men,
actually, interestingly.

00:13:15.241 --> 00:13:17.176
For those who can't walk,

00:13:17.200 --> 00:13:19.715
who are unable to get there right now,

00:13:19.739 --> 00:13:23.359
people started to organize walks
in cities, in their own communities.

00:13:23.383 --> 00:13:25.757
In Cincinnati, for instance,
they organized a walk

00:13:25.781 --> 00:13:29.623
from a church to a mosque to a synagogue
and all had an Abrahamic meal together.

00:13:29.647 --> 00:13:31.109
It was Abraham Path Day.

00:13:31.133 --> 00:13:33.539
In São Paulo, Brazil,
it's become an annual event

00:13:33.563 --> 00:13:37.391
for thousands of people to run
in a virtual Abraham Path Run,

00:13:37.415 --> 00:13:39.186
uniting the different communities.

00:13:39.210 --> 00:13:42.190
The media love it; they really adore it.

00:13:42.214 --> 00:13:45.668
They lavish attention on it
because it's visual

00:13:45.692 --> 00:13:47.356
and it spreads the idea,

00:13:47.380 --> 00:13:51.762
this idea of Abrahamic hospitality,
of kindness towards strangers.

00:13:51.786 --> 00:13:55.976
And just a couple weeks ago,
there was an NPR story on it.

00:13:56.589 --> 00:13:57.757
Last month,

00:13:57.781 --> 00:14:03.698
there was a piece
in the Manchester Guardian about it,

00:14:03.722 --> 00:14:05.587
two whole pages.

00:14:06.349 --> 00:14:09.569
And they quoted a villager

00:14:09.593 --> 00:14:12.680
who said, "This walk connects
us to the world."

00:14:12.704 --> 00:14:15.521
He said, "It was like a light
that went on in our lives --

00:14:15.545 --> 00:14:16.976
it brought us hope."

00:14:17.436 --> 00:14:19.518
And so that's what it's about.

00:14:19.542 --> 00:14:21.348
But it's not just about psychology;

00:14:21.372 --> 00:14:22.848
it's about economics.

00:14:22.872 --> 00:14:25.976
Because as people walk, they spend money.

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.976
And this woman right here, Um Ahmad,

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:32.150
is a woman who lives on the path
in Northern Jordan.

00:14:32.174 --> 00:14:33.976
She's desperately poor.

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:37.645
She's partially blind,
her husband can't work,

00:14:37.669 --> 00:14:39.621
she's got seven kids.

00:14:40.113 --> 00:14:41.976
But what she can do is cook.

00:14:42.671 --> 00:14:45.212
And so she's begun to cook
for some groups of walkers

00:14:45.236 --> 00:14:48.840
who come through the village
and have a meal in her home.

00:14:48.864 --> 00:14:52.164
They sit on the floor --
she doesn't even have a tablecloth.

00:14:52.188 --> 00:14:53.976
She makes the most delicious food,

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:57.122
that's fresh from the herbs
in the surrounding countryside.

00:14:57.146 --> 00:14:59.273
And so more and more walkers have come,

00:14:59.297 --> 00:15:03.191
and lately she's begun to earn an income
to support her family.

00:15:03.215 --> 00:15:06.092
And so she told our team there, she said,

00:15:06.116 --> 00:15:09.282
"You have made me visible

00:15:09.306 --> 00:15:12.976
in a village where people
were once ashamed to look at me."

00:15:13.755 --> 00:15:15.976
That's the potential of the Abraham Path.

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:18.762
There are literally hundreds
of those kinds of communities

00:15:18.786 --> 00:15:21.252
across the Middle East, across the path.

00:15:22.196 --> 00:15:25.102
The potential is basically
to change the game.

00:15:25.459 --> 00:15:29.165
And to change the game, you have to change
the frame, the way we see things --

00:15:29.189 --> 00:15:34.507
to change the frame
from hostility to hospitality,

00:15:34.531 --> 00:15:36.976
from terrorism to tourism.

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:39.737
And in that sense, the Abraham Path

00:15:39.761 --> 00:15:41.372
is a game-changer.

00:15:41.887 --> 00:15:43.665
Let me just show you one thing.

00:15:43.689 --> 00:15:45.299
I have a little acorn here

00:15:45.323 --> 00:15:48.810
that I picked up while I was walking
on the path earlier this year.

00:15:49.366 --> 00:15:52.213
Now, the acorn is associated
with the oak tree, of course --

00:15:52.237 --> 00:15:55.315
grows into an oak tree,
which is associated with Abraham.

00:15:55.339 --> 00:15:57.282
The path right now is like an acorn;

00:15:57.306 --> 00:15:58.976
it's still in its early phase.

00:15:59.393 --> 00:16:01.313
What would the oak tree look like?

00:16:01.337 --> 00:16:02.976
When I think back to my childhood,

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:05.953
a good part of which I spent,
after being born here in Chicago,

00:16:05.977 --> 00:16:07.332
I spent in Europe.

00:16:07.811 --> 00:16:14.517
If you had been in the ruins of, say,
London in 1945, or Berlin,

00:16:14.541 --> 00:16:15.740
and you had said,

00:16:15.764 --> 00:16:17.447
"Sixty years from now,

00:16:17.471 --> 00:16:20.796
this is going to be the most peaceful,
prosperous part of the planet,"

00:16:20.820 --> 00:16:24.134
people would have thought
you were certifiably insane.

00:16:24.158 --> 00:16:27.976
But they did it, thanks
to a common identity, Europe,

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:29.976
and a common economy.

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:33.309
So my question is,
if it can be done in Europe,

00:16:33.333 --> 00:16:34.976
why not in the Middle East?

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:39.687
Why not, thanks to a common identity,
which is the story of Abraham,

00:16:39.711 --> 00:16:44.405
and thanks to a common economy that
would be based, in good part, on tourism?

00:16:45.190 --> 00:16:47.397
So let me conclude, then,

00:16:47.421 --> 00:16:50.770
by saying that in the last 35 years,

00:16:50.794 --> 00:16:53.211
as I've worked
in some of the most dangerous,

00:16:53.235 --> 00:16:56.162
difficult and intractable conflicts
around the planet,

00:16:56.186 --> 00:17:01.791
I have yet to see one conflict
that I felt could not be transformed.

00:17:02.338 --> 00:17:04.191
It's not easy, of course.

00:17:04.703 --> 00:17:05.976
But it's possible.

00:17:06.466 --> 00:17:08.406
It was done in South Africa.

00:17:08.430 --> 00:17:10.315
It was done in Northern Ireland.

00:17:10.339 --> 00:17:11.856
It could be done anywhere.

00:17:11.880 --> 00:17:14.506
It simply depends on us.

00:17:14.530 --> 00:17:17.382
It depends on us taking the third side.

00:17:17.922 --> 00:17:21.534
So let me invite you to consider
taking the third side,

00:17:21.558 --> 00:17:23.224
even as a very small step.

00:17:23.248 --> 00:17:25.470
We're about to take a break in a moment.

00:17:25.494 --> 00:17:27.471
Just go up to someone

00:17:27.495 --> 00:17:30.138
who's from a different culture,
a different country,

00:17:30.162 --> 00:17:32.517
a different ethnicity --
some difference --

00:17:32.541 --> 00:17:34.178
and engage them in a conversation.

00:17:34.202 --> 00:17:35.436
Listen to them.

00:17:35.460 --> 00:17:36.976
That's a third-side act.

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:39.284
That's walking Abraham's Path.

00:17:39.308 --> 00:17:40.833
After a TED Talk,

00:17:40.857 --> 00:17:42.306
why not a TED Walk?

00:17:42.330 --> 00:17:43.751
(Laughter)

00:17:43.775 --> 00:17:47.938
So let me just leave you
with three things.

00:17:47.962 --> 00:17:52.671
One is, the secret to peace
is the third side.

00:17:53.386 --> 00:17:55.806
The third side is us.

00:17:55.830 --> 00:17:59.401
Each of us, with a single step,

00:17:59.425 --> 00:18:02.145
can take the world, can bring the world

00:18:02.169 --> 00:18:04.075
a step closer to peace.

00:18:05.318 --> 00:18:07.374
There's an old African proverb that goes:

00:18:07.398 --> 00:18:09.564
"When spiderwebs unite,

00:18:09.588 --> 00:18:12.151
they can halt even the lion."

00:18:12.670 --> 00:18:16.945
If we're able to unite
our third-side webs of peace,

00:18:16.969 --> 00:18:19.977
we can even halt the lion of war.

00:18:20.001 --> 00:18:21.152
Thank you very much.

00:18:21.176 --> 00:18:24.495
(Applause)
