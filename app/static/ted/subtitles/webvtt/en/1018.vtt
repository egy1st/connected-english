WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Okay, I'm going to show you

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
again something about our diets.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
And I would like to know what the audience is,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
and so who of you ever ate insects?

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
That's quite a lot.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
(Laughter)

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
But still, you're not representing

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
the overall population of the Earth.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
(Laughter)

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Because there's 80 percent out there that really eats insects.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
But this is quite good.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Why not eat insects? Well first, what are insects?

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Insects are animals that walk around on six legs.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
And here you see just a selection.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
There's six million species of insects on this planet,

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
six million species.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
There's a few hundreds of mammals --

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
six million species of insects.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
In fact, if we count all the individual organisms,

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
we would come at much larger numbers.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
In fact, of all animals on Earth,

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
of all animal species,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
80 percent walks on six legs.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
But if we would count all the individuals,

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
and we take an average weight of them,

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
it would amount to something like 200 to 2,000 kilograms

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
for each of you and me on Earth.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
That means that in terms of biomass,

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
insects are more abundant than we are,

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
and we're not on a planet of men,

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
but we're on a planet of insects.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
Insects are not only there in nature,

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
but they also are involved in our economy,

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
usually without us knowing.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
There was an estimation,

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
a conservative estimation, a couple of years ago

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
that the U.S. economy

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
benefited by 57 billion

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
dollars per year.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
It's a number -- very large --

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
a contribution to the economy of the United States for free.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
And so I looked up what the economy was paying

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
for the war in Iraq

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
in the same year.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
It was 80 billion U.S. dollars.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
Well we know that that

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
was not a cheap war.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
So insects, just for free,

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
contribute to the economy of the United States

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
with about the same order of magnitude,

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
just for free, without everyone knowing.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
And not only in the States,

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
but in any country, in any economy.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
What do they do?

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
They remove dung, they pollinate our crops.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
A third of all the fruits that we eat

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
are all a result

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000
of insects taking care of the reproduction of plants.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
They control pests,

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
and they're food for animals.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
They're at the start of food chains.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
Small animals eat insects.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
Even larger animals eat insects.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
But the small animals that eat insects

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
are being eaten by larger animals,

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
still larger animals.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000
And at the end of the food chain, we are eating them as well.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
There's quite a lot of people that are eating insects.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
And here you see me

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
in a small, provincial town in China, Lijiang --

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
about two million inhabitants.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000
If you go out for dinner, like in a fish restaurant,

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000
where you can select which fish you want to eat,

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
you can select which insects you would like to eat.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
And they prepare it in a wonderful way.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
And here you see me enjoying a meal

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000
with caterpillars, locusts,

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000
bee pupae -- delicacies.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000
And you can eat something new everyday.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000
There's more than 1,000 species of insects

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000
that are being eaten all around the globe.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
That's quite a bit more

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
than just a few mammals that we're eating,

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000
like a cow or a pig

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000
or a sheep.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
More than 1,000 species --

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
an enormous variety.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
And now you may think, okay,

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000
in this provincial town in China they're doing that, but not us.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000
Well we've seen already that quite some of you

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.000
already ate insects maybe occasionally,

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000
but I can tell you that every one of you

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000
is eating insects, without any exception.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000
You're eating at least

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000
500 grams per year.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000
What are you eating?

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000
Tomato soup, peanut butter,

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000
chocolate, noodles --

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000
any processed food that you're eating

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
contains insects,

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.000
because insects are here all around us,

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000
and when they're out there in nature

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000
they're also in our crops.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000
Some fruits get some insect damage.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000
Those are the fruits, if they're tomato,

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000
that go to the tomato soup.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.000
If they don't have any damage, they go to the grocery.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.000
And that's your view of a tomato.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.000
But there's tomatoes that end up in a soup,

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000
and as long as they meet

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000
the requirements of the food agency,

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000
there can be all kinds of things in there,

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000
no problem.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.000
In fact, why would we put these balls in the soup,

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000
there's meat in there anyway?

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.000
(Laughter)

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000
In fact, all our processed foods

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000
contain more proteins

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.000
than we would be aware of.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.000
So anything is a good protein source already.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000
Now you may say,

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.000
"Okay, so we're eating 500 grams just by accident."

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000
We're even doing this on purpose.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000
In a lot of food items that we have --

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000
I have only two items

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000
here on the slide --

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000
pink cookies or surimi sticks

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000
or, if you like, Campari --

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.000
a lot of our food products that are of a red color

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.000
are dyed with a natural dye.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000
The surimi sticks

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000
[of] crabmeat, or is being sold as crab meat,

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000
is white fish

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000
that's being dyed with cochineal.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000
Cochineal is a product

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.000
of an insect that lives off these cacti.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000
It's being produced in large amounts,

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000
150 to 180 metric tons per year

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.000
in the Canary Islands in Peru,

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.000
and it's big business.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.000
One gram of cochineal

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000
costs about 30 euros.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.000
One gram of gold

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.000
is 30 euros.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.000
So it's a very precious thing

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.000
that we're using to dye our foods.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.000
Now the situation in the world is going to change

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000
for you and me, for everyone on this Earth.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000
The human population is growing very rapidly

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000
and is growing exponentially.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000
Where, at the moment, we have

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.000
something between six and seven billion people,

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.000
it will grow to about nine billion

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.000
in 2050.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.000
That means that we have a lot more mouths to feed,

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.000
and this is something that worries more and more people.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000
There was an FAO conference last October

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000
that was completely devoted to this.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000
How are we going to feed this world?

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000
And if you look at the figures up there,

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.000
it says that we have a third more mouths to feed,

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.000
but we need an agricultural production increase

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.000
of 70 percent.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.000
And that's especially because this world population

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000
is increasing,

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.000
and it's increasing, not only in numbers,

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.000
but we're also getting wealthier,

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.000
and anyone that gets wealthier starts to eat more

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.000
and also starts to eat more meat.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000
And meat, in fact, is something

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000
that costs a lot

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.000
of our agricultural production.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.000
Our diet consists, [in] some part, of animal proteins,

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000
and at the moment, most of us here

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000
get it from livestock,

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.000
from fish, from game.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.000
And we eat quite a lot of it.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:11.000
In the developed world it's on average

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.000
80 kilograms per person per year,

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.000
which goes up to 120

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.000
in the United States

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.000
and a bit lower in some other countries,

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.000
but on average 80 kilograms

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.000
per person per year.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.000
In the developing world it's much lower.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000
It's 25 kilograms per person per year.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000
But it's increasing enormously.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.000
In China in the last 20 years,

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:36.000
it increased from 20 to 50,

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.000
and it's still increasing.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.000
So if a third of the world population

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:45.000
is going to increase its meat consumption

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.000
from 25 to 80 on average,

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.000
and a third of the world population

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000
is living in China and in India,

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:55.000
we're having an enormous demand on meat.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.000
And of course, we are not there to say

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:01.000
that's only for us, it's not for them.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.000
They have the same share that we have.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.000
Now to start with, I should say

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.000
that we are eating way too much meat

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.000
in the Western world.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.000
We could do with much, much less --

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:14.000
and I know, I've been a vegetarian for a long time,

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.000
and you can easily do without anything.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:19.000
You'll get proteins in any kind of food anyway.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.000
But then there's a lot of problems

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.000
that come with meat production,

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:26.000
and we're being faced with that more and more often.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:29.000
The first problem that we're facing is human health.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000
Pigs are quite like us.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:34.000
They're even models in medicine,

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:37.000
and we can even transplant organs from a pig to a human.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:40.000
That means that pigs also share diseases with us.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000
And a pig disease,

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.000
a pig virus, and a human virus

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000
can both proliferate,

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.000
and because of their kind of reproduction,

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000
they can combine and produce a new virus.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:53.000
This has happened in the Netherlands in the 1990s

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:56.000
during the classical swine fever outbreak.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:59.000
You get a new disease that can be deadly.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.000
We eat insects -- they're so distantly related from us

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.000
that this doesn't happen.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:08.000
So that's one point for insects.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.000
(Laughter)

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:13.000
And there's the conversion factor.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.000
You take 10 kilograms of feed,

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:18.000
you can get one kilogram of beef,

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.000
but you can get nine kilograms of locust meat.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.000
So if you would be an entrepreneur,

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.000
what would you do?

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.000
With 10 kilograms of input,

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:29.000
you can get either one or nine kg. of output.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.000
So far we're taking

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:34.000
the one, or up to five kilograms of output.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.000
We're not taking the bonus yet.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.000
We're not taking the nine kilograms of output yet.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.000
So that's two points for insects.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.000
(Laughter)

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.000
And there's the environment.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.000
If we take 10 kilograms of food --

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.000
(Laughter)

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:52.000
and it results in one kilogram of beef,

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.000
the other nine kilograms are waste,

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:57.000
and a lot of that is manure.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.000
If you produce insects, you have less manure

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:02.000
per kilogram of meat that you produce.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.000
So less waste.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:07.000
Furthermore, per kilogram of manure,

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:10.000
you have much, much less ammonia

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.000
and fewer greenhouse gases

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.000
when you have insect manure

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.000
than when you have cow manure.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.000
So you have less waste,

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:21.000
and the waste that you have is not as environmental malign

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.000
as it is with cow dung.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.000
So that's three points for insects.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:28.000
(Laughter)

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.000
Now there's a big "if," of course,

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:33.000
and it is if insects produce meat

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.000
that is of good quality.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.000
Well there have been all kinds of analyses

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:40.000
and in terms of protein, or fat, or vitamins,

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.000
it's very good.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.000
In fact, it's comparable

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.000
to anything we eat as meat at the moment.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.000
And even in terms of calories, it is very good.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.000
One kilogram of grasshoppers

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.000
has the same amount of calories

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:54.000
as 10 hot dogs, or six Big Macs.

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.000
So that's four points for insects.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:59.000
(Laughter)

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.000
I can go on,

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:03.000
and I could make many more points for insects,

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:05.000
but time doesn't allow this.

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:07.000
So the question is, why not eat insects?

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.000
I gave you at least four arguments in favor.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.000
We'll have to.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.000
Even if you don't like it,

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.000
you'll have to get used to this

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.000
because at the moment,

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.000
70 percent of all our agricultural land

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.000
is being used to produce livestock.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.000
That's not only the land

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.000
where the livestock is walking and feeding,

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.000
but it's also other areas

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:30.000
where the feed is being produced and being transported.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.000
We can increase it a bit

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.000
at the expense of rainforests,

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.000
but there's a limitation very soon.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.000
And if you remember that we need to increase

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.000
agricultural production by 70 percent,

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:42.000
we're not going to make it that way.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:44.000
We could much better change

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:47.000
from meat, from beef,

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.000
to insects.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:52.000
And then 80 percent of the world

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.000
already eats insects,

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.000
so we are just a minority --

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:59.000
in a country like the U.K., the USA,

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:02.000
the Netherlands, anywhere.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.000
On the left-hand side, you see a market in Laos

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.000
where they have abundantly present

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:09.000
all kinds of insects that you choose for dinner for the night.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.000
On the right-hand side you see a grasshopper.

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:16.000
So people there are eating them,

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.000
not because they're hungry,

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.000
but because they think it's a delicacy.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.000
It's just very good food.

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:24.000
You can vary enormously.

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:26.000
It has many benefits.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.000
In fact, we have delicacy

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.000
that's very much like this grasshopper:

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:33.000
shrimps, a delicacy

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:35.000
being sold at a high price.

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:37.000
Who wouldn't like to eat a shrimp?

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.000
There are a few people who don't like shrimp,

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:41.000
but shrimp, or crabs,

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.000
or crayfish,

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:45.000
are very closely related.

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:47.000
They are delicacies.

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:50.000
In fact, a locust is a "shrimp" of the land,

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:53.000
and it would make very good into our diet.

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.000
So why are we not eating insects yet?

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.000
Well that's just a matter of mindset.

00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:59.000
We're not used to it,

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:02.000
and we see insects as these organisms that are very different from us.

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:05.000
That's why we're changing the perception of insects.

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:08.000
And I'm working very hard with my colleague, Arnold van Huis,

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:11.000
in telling people what insects are,

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:13.000
what magnificent things they are,

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:15.000
what magnificent jobs they do in nature.

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:17.000
And in fact, without insects,

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:19.000
we would not be here in this room,

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:21.000
because if the insects die out,

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:24.000
we will soon die out as well.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:27.000
If we die out, the insects will continue very happily.

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:29.000
(Laughter)

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:31.000
So we have to get used to the idea of eating insects.

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.000
And some might think, well they're not yet available.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:35.000
Well they are.

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:38.000
There are entrepreneurs in the Netherlands that produce them,

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.000
and one of them is here in the audience,

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:42.000
Marian Peeters, who's in the picture.

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:45.000
I predict that later this year, you'll get them in the supermarkets --

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.000
not visible, but as animal protein

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:49.000
in the food.

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:54.000
And maybe by 2020,

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:57.000
you'll buy them just knowing that this is an insect that you're going to eat.

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:00.000
And they're being made in the most wonderful ways.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:03.000
A Dutch chocolate maker.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:06.000
(Music)

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.000
(Applause)

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:44.000
So there's even a lot of design to it.

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:47.000
(Laughter)

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:50.000
Well in the Netherlands, we have an innovative Minister of Agriculture,

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:52.000
and she puts the insects on the menu

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:55.000
in her restaurant in her ministry.

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:58.000
And when she got all the Ministers of Agriculture of the E.U.

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:01.000
over to the Hague recently,

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:04.000
she went to a high-class restaurant,

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:06.000
and they ate insects all together.

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:09.000
It's not something that is a hobby of mine.

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:11.000
It's really taken off the ground.

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:13.000
So why not eat insects?

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:15.000
You should try it yourself.

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:18.000
A couple of years ago, we had 1,750 people all together

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:21.000
in a square in Wageningen town,

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:23.000
and they ate insects at the same moment,

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:26.000
and this was still big, big news.

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:29.000
I think soon it will not be big news anymore when we all eat insects,

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:31.000
because it's just a normal way of doing.

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:34.000
So you can try it yourself today,

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:37.000
and I would say, enjoy.

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:40.000
And I'm going to show to Bruno some first tries,

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:43.000
and he can have the first bite.

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:52.000
(Applause)

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:58.000
Bruno Giussani: Look at them first. Look at them first.

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:00.000
Marcel Dicke: It's all protein.

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:04.000
BG: That's exactly the same [one] you saw in the video actually.

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:06.000
And it looks delicious.

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:09.000
They just make it [with] nuts or something.

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:11.000
MD: Thank you.

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:13.000
(Applause)
