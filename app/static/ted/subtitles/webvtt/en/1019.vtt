00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.000
I'm here today to share with you

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
an extraordinary journey -

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
extraordinarily rewarding journey,
actually -

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
which brought me into

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
training rats

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
to save human lives

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
by detecting landmines

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
and tuberculosis.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
As a child, I had two passions.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
One was a passion for rodents.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
I had all kinds of rats,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
mice, hamsters,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
gerbils, squirrels.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
You name it, I bred it, and I sold them to pet shops.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
(Laughter)

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
I also had a passion for Africa.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Growing up in a multicultural environment,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
we had African students in the house,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
and I learned about their stories,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
so different backgrounds,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
dependency on imported know-how,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
goods, services,

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
exuberant cultural diversity.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
Africa was truly fascinating for me.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
I became an industrial engineer,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
engineer in product development,

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
and I focused on appropriate detection technologies,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
actually the first appropriate technologies

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
for developing countries.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
I started working in the industry,

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
but I wasn't really happy to contribute

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
to a material consumer society

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
in a linear, extracting

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
and manufacturing mode.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
I quit my job to focus on the real world problem:

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
landmines.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
We're talking '95 now.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
Princess Diana is announcing on TV

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
that landmines form a structural barrier

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
to any development, which is really true.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
As long as these devices are there,

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
or there is suspicion of landmines,

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
you can't really enter into the land.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
Actually, there was an appeal worldwide

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
for new detectors

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
sustainable in the environments

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
where they're needed to produce,

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
which is mainly in the developing world.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
We chose rats.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
Why would you choose rats?

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
Because, aren't they vermin?

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
Well, actually rats are,

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
in contrary to what most people think about them,

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.000
rats are highly sociable creatures.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
And actually, our product -- what you see here.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
There's a target somewhere here.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
You see an operator, a trained African

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
with his rats in front

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
who actually are left and right.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
There, the animal finds a mine.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
It scratches on the soil.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000
And the animal comes back for a food reward.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
Very, very simple.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
Very sustainable in this environment.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
Here, the animal gets its food reward.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
And that's how it works.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
Very, very simple.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
Now why would you use rats?

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
Rats have been used since the '50s last century,

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000
in all kinds of experiments.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000
Rats have more genetic material

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
allocated to olfaction

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
than any other mammal species.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
They're extremely sensitive to smell.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
Moreover, they have the mechanisms to map all these smells

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
and to communicate about it.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
Now how do we communicate with rats?

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000
Well don't talk rat,

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000
but we have a clicker,

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
a standard method for animal training,

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
which you see there.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000
A clicker, which makes a particular sound

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000
with which you can reinforce particular behaviors.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000
First of all, we associate the click sound with a food reward,

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.000
which is smashed banana and peanuts together in a syringe.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
Once the animal knows click, food,

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
click, food, click, food --

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
so click is food --

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
we bring it in a cage with a hole,

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000
and actually the animal learns

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000
to stick the nose in the hole

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000
under which a target scent is placed,

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000
and to do that for five seconds --

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000
five seconds, which is long for a rat.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000
Once the animal knows this, we make the task a bit more difficult.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000
It learns how to find the target smell

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.000
in a cage with several holes, up to 10 holes.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000
Then the animal learns

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000
to walk on a leash in the open

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000
and find targets.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
In the next step, animals learn

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
to find real mines in real minefields.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.000
They are tested and accredited

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000
according to International Mine Action Standards,

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.000
just like dogs have to pass a test.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000
This consists of 400 square meters.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000
There's a number of mines

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000
placed blindly,

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.000
and the team of trainer and their rat

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.000
have to find all the targets.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000
If the animal does that, it gets a license

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000
as an accredited animal

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000
to be operational in the field --

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000
just like dogs, by the way.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000
Maybe one slight difference:

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.000
we can train rats at a fifth of the price

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000
of training the mining dog.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000
This is our team in Mozambique:

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000
one Tanzanian trainer,

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000
who transfers the skills

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000
to these three Mozambican fellows.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.000
And you should see the pride in the eyes of these people.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000
They have a skill,

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000
which makes them much less dependent

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000
on foreign aid.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000
Moreover, this small team

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000
together with, of course, you need the heavy vehicles

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000
and the manual de-miners to follow-up.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000
But with this small investment in a rat capacity,

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.000
we have demonstrated in Mozambique

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.000
that we can reduce the cost-price per square meter

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000
up to 60 percent

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000
of what is currently normal --

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000
two dollars per square meter, we do it at $1.18,

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000
and we can still bring that price down.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000
Question of scale.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000
If you can bring in more rats,

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000
we can actually make the output even bigger.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.000
We have a demonstration site in Mozambique.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.000
Eleven African governments

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.000
have seen that they can become less dependent

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000
by using this technology.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000
They have signed the pact for peace

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.000
and treaty in the Great Lakes region,

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.000
and they endorse hero rats

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.000
to clear their common borders of landmines.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.000
But let me bring you to a very different problem.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000
And there's about 6,000 people last year

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000
that walked on a landmine,

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000
but worldwide last year,

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000
almost 1.9 million died from tuberculosis

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.000
as a first cause of infection.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000
Especially in Africa

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.000
where T.B. and HIV are strongly linked,

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:15.000
there is a huge common problem.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.000
Microscopy, the standard WHO procedure,

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.000
reaches from 40 to 60 percent reliability.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.000
In Tanzania -- the numbers don't lie --

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.000
45 percent of people -- T.B. patients --

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.000
get diagnosed with T.B. before they die.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.000
It means that, if you have T.B.,

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.000
you have more chance that you won't be detected,

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.000
but will just die from T.B. secondary infections and so on.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000
And if, however,

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000
you are detected very early, diagnosed early,

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000
treatment can start,

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.000
and even in HIV-positives, it makes sense.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000
You can actually cure T.B.,

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.000
even in HIV-positives.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.000
So in our common language, Dutch,

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000
the name for T.B.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.000
is "tering,"

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.000
which, etymologically,

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:11.000
refers to the smell of tar.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.000
Already the old Chinese

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:16.000
and the Greek, Hippocrates,

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.000
have actually published,

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.000
documented, that T.B. can be diagnosed

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.000
based on the volatiles

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:26.000
exuding from patients.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.000
So what we did is we collected some samples --

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000
just as a way of testing --

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000
from hospitals,

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.000
trained rats on them

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.000
and see if this works,

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.000
and wonder, well,

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.000
we can reach 89 percent sensitivity,

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.000
86 percent specificity

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.000
using multiple rats in a row.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.000
This is how it works,

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:51.000
and really, this is a generic technology.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:54.000
We're talking now explosives, tuberculosis,

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.000
but can you imagine,

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.000
you can actually put anything under there.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000
So how does it work?

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000
You have a cassette with 10 samples.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:05.000
You put these 10 samples at once in the cage.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.000
An animal only needs two hundredths of a second

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:10.000
to discriminate the scent, so it goes extremely fast.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:13.000
Here it's already at the third sample.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:16.000
This is a positive sample.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:20.000
It gets a click sound and comes for the food reward.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.000
And by doing so, very fast,

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.000
we can have like a second-line opinion

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.000
to see which patients are positive,

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:32.000
which are negative.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.000
Just as an indication,

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.000
whereas a microscopist can process

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.000
40 samples in a day,

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.000
a rat can process

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000
the same amount of samples

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.000
in seven minutes only.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000
A cage like this --

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:51.000
(Applause)

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:54.000
A cage like this -- provided that you have rats,

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.000
and we have now currently

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.000
25 tuberculosis rats --

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:01.000
a cage like this, operating throughout the day,

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:04.000
can process 1,680 samples.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:09.000
Can you imagine the potential offspring applications --

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.000
environmental detection

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.000
of pollutants in soils,

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.000
customs applications,

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:18.000
detection of illicit goods in containers and so on.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.000
But let's stick first to tuberculosis.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.000
I just want to briefly highlight,

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.000
the blue rods

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.000
are the scores of microscopy only

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:30.000
at the five clinics in Dar es Salaam

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.000
on a population of 500,000 people,

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:35.000
where 15,000 reported to get a test done.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:38.000
Microscopy for 1,800 patients.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:42.000
And by just presenting the samples once more to the rats

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.000
and looping those results back,

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.000
we were able to increase case detection rates

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.000
by over 30 percent.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.000
Throughout last year,

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.000
we've been -- depending on which intervals you take --

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.000
we've been consistently

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.000
increasing case detection rates

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.000
in five hospitals in Dar es Salaam

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:02.000
between 30 and 40 percent.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.000
So this is really considerable.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.000
Knowing that a missed patient by microscopy

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.000
infects up to 15 people,

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.000
healthy people, per year,

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.000
you can be sure

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.000
that we have saved lots of lives.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:17.000
At least our hero rats have saved lots of lives.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.000
The way forward for us

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.000
is now to standardize this technology.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.000
And there are simple things

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:27.000
like, for instance, we have a small laser in the sniffer hole

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.000
where the animal has to stick for five seconds.

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.000
So, to standardize this.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:33.000
Also, to standardize the pellets,

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.000
the food rewards,

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.000
and to semi-automate this

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:40.000
in order to replicate this on a much larger scale

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:43.000
and affect the lives of many more people.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:46.000
To conclude, there are also other applications at the horizon.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.000
Here is a first prototype

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.000
of our camera rat,

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.000
which is a rat with a rat backpack

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:54.000
with a camera that can go under rubble

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.000
to detect for victims

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.000
after earthquake and so on.

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.000
This is in a prototype stage.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.000
We don't have a working system here yet.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:06.000
To conclude, I would actually like to say,

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.000
you may think this is about rats, these projects,

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.000
but in the end it is about people.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.000
It is about empowering vulnerable communities

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:15.000
to tackle difficult, expensive

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:18.000
and dangerous humanitarian detection tasks,

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:21.000
and doing that with a local resource,

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.000
plenty available.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:26.000
So something completely different

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:29.000
is to keep on challenging your perception

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:32.000
about the resources surrounding you,

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:35.000
whether they are environmental,

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:38.000
technological, animal, or human.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:43.000
And to respectfully harmonize with them

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:46.000
in order to foster a sustainable world.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.000
Thank you very much.

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.000
(Applause)
