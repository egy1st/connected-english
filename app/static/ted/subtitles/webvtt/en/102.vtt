00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.000
So I'm going to speak about a problem that I have

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
and that's that I'm a philosopher.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
(Laughter)

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
When I go to a party and people ask me what do I do

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.000
and I say, "I'm a professor," their eyes glaze over.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
When I go to an academic cocktail party

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
and there are all the professors around, they ask me what field I'm in

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
and I say, "philosophy" -- their eyes glaze over.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
(Laughter)

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
When I go to a philosopher's party

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
(Laughter)

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
and they ask me what I work on and I say, "consciousness,"

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.000
their eyes don't glaze over -- their lips curl into a snarl.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.000
(Laughter)

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:50.000
And I get hoots of derision and cackles and growls

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.000
because they think, "That's impossible! You can't explain consciousness."

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
The very chutzpah of somebody thinking

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.000
that you could explain consciousness is just out of the question.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000
My late, lamented friend Bob Nozick, a fine philosopher,

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000
in one of his books, "Philosophical Explanations,"

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.000
is commenting on the ethos of philosophy --

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
the way philosophers go about their business.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
And he says, you know, "Philosophers love rational argument."

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
And he says, "It seems as if the ideal argument

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:28.000
for most philosophers is you give your audience the premises

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:33.000
and then you give them the inferences and the conclusion,

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.000
and if they don't accept the conclusion, they die.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
Their heads explode." The idea is to have an argument

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000
that is so powerful that it knocks out your opponents.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
But in fact that doesn't change people's minds at all.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.000
It's very hard to change people's minds

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
about something like consciousness,

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:55.000
and I finally figured out the reason for that.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.000
The reason for that is that everybody's an expert on consciousness.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.000
We heard the other day that everybody's got a strong opinion about video games.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
They all have an idea for a video game, even if they're not experts.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
But they don't consider themselves experts on video games;

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.000
they've just got strong opinions.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.000
I'm sure that people here who work on, say, climate change

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:20.000
and global warming, or on the future of the Internet,

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
encounter people who have very strong opinions

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000
about what's going to happen next.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.000
But they probably don't think of these opinions as expertise.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
They're just strongly held opinions.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.000
But with regard to consciousness, people seem to think,

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000
each of us seems to think, "I am an expert.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000
Simply by being conscious, I know all about this."

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
And so, you tell them your theory and they say,

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.000
"No, no, that's not the way consciousness is!

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
No, you've got it all wrong."

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.000
And they say this with an amazing confidence.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000
And so what I'm going to try to do today

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.000
is to shake your confidence. Because I know the feeling --

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
I can feel it myself.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:03.000
I want to shake your confidence that you know your own innermost minds --

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:08.000
that you are, yourselves, authoritative about your own consciousness.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000
That's the order of the day here.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000
Now, this nice picture shows a thought-balloon, a thought-bubble.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
I think everybody understands what that means.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000
That's supposed to exhibit the stream of consciousness.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
This is my favorite picture of consciousness that's ever been done.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000
It's a Saul Steinberg of course -- it was a New Yorker cover.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:29.000
And this fellow here is looking at the painting by Braque.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.000
That reminds him of the word baroque, barrack, bark, poodle,

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000
Suzanne R. -- he's off to the races.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:39.000
There's a wonderful stream of consciousness here

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.000
and if you follow it along, you learn a lot about this man.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000
What I particularly like about this picture, too,

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000
is that Steinberg has rendered the guy

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.000
in this sort of pointillist style.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.000
Which reminds us, as Rod Brooks was saying yesterday:

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:57.000
what we are, what each of us is -- what you are, what I am --

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:03.000
is approximately 100 trillion little cellular robots.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000
That's what we're made of.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:09.000
No other ingredients at all. We're just made of cells, about 100 trillion of them.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000
Not a single one of those cells is conscious;

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:16.000
not a single one of those cells knows who you are, or cares.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000
Somehow, we have to explain

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.000
how when you put together teams, armies, battalions

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.000
of hundreds of millions of little robotic unconscious cells --

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:30.000
not so different really from a bacterium, each one of them --

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.000
the result is this. I mean, just look at it.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.000
The content -- there's color, there's ideas, there's memories,

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:42.000
there's history. And somehow all that content of consciousness

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:47.000
is accomplished by the busy activity of those hoards of neurons.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:51.000
How is that possible? Many people just think it isn't possible at all.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000
They think, "No, there can't be any

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:57.000
sort of naturalistic explanation of consciousness."

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000
This is a lovely book by a friend of mine named Lee Siegel,

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000
who's a professor of religion, actually, at the University of Hawaii,

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000
and he's an expert magician, and an expert

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:09.000
on the street magic of India, which is what this book is about,

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000
"Net of Magic."

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.000
And there's a passage in it which I would love to share with you.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:20.000
It speaks so eloquently to the problem.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:25.000
"'I'm writing a book on magic,' I explain, and I'm asked, 'Real magic?'

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000
By 'real magic,' people mean miracles,

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000
thaumaturgical acts, and supernatural powers.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:33.000
'No,' I answer. 'Conjuring tricks, not real magic.'

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:37.000
'Real magic,' in other words, refers to the magic that is not real;

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:42.000
while the magic that is real, that can actually be done, is not real magic."

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:46.000
(Laughter)

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:50.000
Now, that's the way a lot of people feel about consciousness.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:51.000
(Laughter)

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000
Real consciousness is not a bag of tricks.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.000
If you're going to explain this as a bag of tricks,

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.000
then it's not real consciousness, whatever it is.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:04.000
And, as Marvin said, and as other people have said,

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.000
"Consciousness is a bag of tricks."

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:12.000
This means that a lot of people are just left completely dissatisfied

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.000
and incredulous when I attempt to explain consciousness.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.000
So this is the problem. So I have to

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.000
do a little bit of the sort of work

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:25.000
that a lot of you won't like,

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000
for the same reason that you don't like to see

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000
a magic trick explained to you.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:33.000
How many of you here, if somebody -- some smart aleck --

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.000
starts telling you how a particular magic trick is done,

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.000
you sort of want to block your ears and say, "No, no, I don't want to know!

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.000
Don't take the thrill of it away. I'd rather be mystified.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.000
Don't tell me the answer."

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.000
A lot of people feel that way about consciousness, I've discovered.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:54.000
And I'm sorry if I impose some clarity, some understanding on you.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:59.000
You'd better leave now if you don't want to know some of these tricks.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:03.000
But I'm not going to explain it all to you.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.000
I'm going to do what philosophers do.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:12.000
Here's how a philosopher explains the sawing-the-lady-in-half trick.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.000
You know the sawing-the-lady-in-half trick?

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:18.000
The philosopher says, "I'm going to explain to you how that's done.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:23.000
You see, the magician doesn't really saw the lady in half."

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.000
(Laughter)

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:29.000
"He merely makes you think that he does."

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:30.000
And you say, "Yes, and how does he do that?"

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000
He says, "Oh, that's not my department, I'm sorry."

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:37.000
(Laughter)

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:40.000
So now I'm going to illustrate how philosophers explain consciousness.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.000
But I'm going to try to also show you

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:46.000
that consciousness isn't quite as marvelous --

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.000
your own consciousness isn't quite as wonderful --

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.000
as you may have thought it is.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:54.000
This is something, by the way, that Lee Siegel talks about in his book.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:58.000
He marvels at how he'll do a magic show, and afterwards

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:02.000
people will swear they saw him do X, Y, and Z. He never did those things.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000
He didn't even try to do those things.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:08.000
People's memories inflate what they think they saw.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:11.000
And the same is true of consciousness.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:18.000
Now, let's see if this will work. All right. Let's just watch this.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:19.000
Watch it carefully.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:34.000
I'm working with a young computer-animator documentarian

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:39.000
named Nick Deamer, and this is a little demo that he's done for me,

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.000
part of a larger project some of you may be interested in.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.000
We're looking for a backer.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:49.000
It's a feature-length documentary on consciousness.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000
OK, now, you all saw what changed, right?

00:08:55.000 --> 00:09:00.000
How many of you noticed that every one of those squares changed color?

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:04.000
Every one. I'll just show you by running it again.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:14.000
Even when you know that they're all going to change color,

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:18.000
it's very hard to notice. You have to really concentrate

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:21.000
to pick up any of the changes at all.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:26.000
Now, this is an example -- one of many --

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.000
of a phenomenon that's now being studied quite a bit.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:32.000
It's one that I predicted in the last page or two of my

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.000
1991 book, "Consciousness Explained,"

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:37.000
where I said if you did experiments of this sort,

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:40.000
you'd find that people were unable to pick up really large changes.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.000
If there's time at the end,

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.000
I'll show you the much more dramatic case.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:50.000
Now, how can it be that there are all those changes going on,

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:53.000
and that we're not aware of them?

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:58.000
Well, earlier today, Jeff Hawkins mentioned the way your eye saccades,

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:01.000
the way your eye moves around three or four times a second.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:04.000
He didn't mention the speed. Your eye is constantly in motion,

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:07.000
moving around, looking at eyes, noses, elbows,

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.000
looking at interesting things in the world.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.000
And where your eye isn't looking,

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:14.000
you're remarkably impoverished in your vision.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:17.000
That's because the foveal part of your eye,

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.000
which is the high-resolution part,

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:22.000
is only about the size of your thumbnail held at arms length.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.000
That's the detail part.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:27.000
It doesn't seem that way, does it?

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.000
It doesn't seem that way, but that's the way it is.

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:33.000
You're getting in a lot less information than you think.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:39.000
Here's a completely different effect. This is a painting by Bellotto.

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.000
It's in the museum in North Carolina.

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:44.000
Bellotto was a student of Canaletto's.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:45.000
And I love paintings like that --

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:49.000
the painting is actually about as big as it is right here.

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:52.000
And I love Canalettos, because Canaletto has this fantastic detail,

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:55.000
and you can get right up

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:58.000
and see all the details on the painting.

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:03.000
And I started across the hall in North Carolina,

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:05.000
because I thought it was probably a Canaletto,

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:07.000
and would have all that in detail.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:10.000
And I noticed that on the bridge there, there's a lot of people --

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:13.000
you can just barely see them walking across the bridge.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:14.000
And I thought as I got closer

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:17.000
I would be able to see all the detail of most people,

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.000
see their clothes, and so forth.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:23.000
And as I got closer and closer, I actually screamed.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.000
I yelled out because when I got closer,

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:29.000
I found the detail wasn't there at all.

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:33.000
There were just little artfully placed blobs of paint.

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:36.000
And as I walked towards the picture,

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:39.000
I was expecting detail that wasn't there.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:44.000
The artist had very cleverly suggested people and clothes

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:47.000
and wagons and all sorts of things,

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:50.000
and my brain had taken the suggestion.

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:56.000
You're familiar with a more recent technology, which is -- There,

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.000
you can get a better view of the blobs.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.000
See, when you get close

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:05.000
they're really just blobs of paint.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:11.000
You will have seen something like this -- this is the reverse effect.

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:22.000
I'll just give that to you one more time.

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:29.000
Now, what does your brain do when it takes the suggestion?

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:34.000
When an artful blob of paint or two, by an artist,

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:40.000
suggests a person -- say, one of

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:42.000
Marvin Minsky's little society of mind --

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:47.000
do they send little painters out to fill in all the details in your brain somewhere?

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:52.000
I don't think so. Not a chance. But then, how on Earth is it done?

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:57.000
Well, remember the philosopher's explanation of the lady?

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:00.000
It's the same thing.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:03.000
The brain just makes you think that it's got the detail there.

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:06.000
You think the detail's there, but it isn't there.

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:09.000
The brain isn't actually putting the detail in your head at all.

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:12.000
It's just making you expect the detail.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:15.000
Let's just do this experiment very quickly.

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:20.000
Is the shape on the left the same as the shape on the right, rotated?

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.000
Yes.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.000
How many of you did it by rotating the one on the left

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:27.000
in your mind's eye, to see if it matched up with the one on the right?

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:31.000
How many of you rotated the one on the right? OK.

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.000
How do you know that's what you did?

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:36.000
(Laughter)

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.000
There's in fact been a very interesting debate

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:41.000
raging for over 20 years in cognitive science --

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:43.000
various experiments started by Roger Shepherd,

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:48.000
who measured the angular velocity of rotation of mental images.

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.000
Yes, it's possible to do that.

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:57.000
But the details of the process are still in significant controversy.

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:00.000
And if you read that literature, one of the things

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:03.000
that you really have to come to terms with is

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:05.000
even when you're the subject in the experiment, you don't know.

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:07.000
You don't know how you do it.

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:10.000
You just know that you have certain beliefs.

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:13.000
And they come in a certain order, at a certain time.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:15.000
And what explains the fact that that's what you think?

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:19.000
Well, that's where you have to go backstage and ask the magician.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:23.000
This is a figure that I love: Bradley, Petrie, and Dumais.

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:25.000
You may think that I've cheated,

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:30.000
that I've put a little whiter-than-white boundary there.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.000
How many of you see that sort of boundary,

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:35.000
with the Necker cube floating in front of the circles?

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:37.000
Can you see it?

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:42.000
Well, you know, in effect, the boundary's really there, in a certain sense.

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:45.000
Your brain is actually computing that boundary,

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:50.000
the boundary that goes right there.

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:52.000
But now, notice there are two ways of seeing the cube, right?

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:54.000
It's a Necker cube.

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:58.000
Everybody can see the two ways of seeing the cube? OK.

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:02.000
Can you see the four ways of seeing the cube?

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:04.000
Because there's another way of seeing it.

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:07.000
If you're seeing it as a cube floating in front of some circles,

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:10.000
some black circles, there's another way of seeing it.

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:12.000
As a cube, on a black background,

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:14.000
as seen through a piece of Swiss cheese.

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:17.000
(Laughter)

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:23.000
Can you get it? How many of you can't get it? That'll help.

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:25.000
(Laughter)

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:30.000
Now you can get it. These are two very different phenomena.

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:36.000
When you see the cube one way, behind the screen,

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:38.000
those boundaries go away.

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:43.000
But there's still a sort of filling in, as we can tell if we look at this.

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:47.000
We don't have any trouble seeing the cube, but where does the color change?

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:50.000
Does your brain have to send little painters in there?

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:52.000
The purple-painters and the green-painters

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:55.000
fight over who's going to paint that bit behind the curtain? No.

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:59.000
Your brain just lets it go. The brain doesn't need to fill that in.

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:07.000
When I first started talking about

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:11.000
the Bradley, Petrie, Dumais example that you just saw --

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:15.000
I'll go back to it, this one --

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:22.000
I said that there was no filling-in behind there.

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:25.000
And I supposed that that was just a flat truth, always true.

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:30.000
But Rob Van Lier has recently shown that it isn't.

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:35.000
Now, if you think you see some pale yellow --

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:37.000
I'll run this a few more times.

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:41.000
Look in the gray areas,

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:46.000
and see if you seem to see something sort of shadowy moving in there --

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:53.000
yeah, it's amazing. There's nothing there. It's no trick.

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:59.000
["Failure to Detect Changes in Scenes" slide]

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:01.000
This is Ron Rensink's work, which was in some degree

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:05.000
inspired by that suggestion right at the end of the book.

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:07.000
Let me just pause this for a second if I can.

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:09.000
This is change-blindness.

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:11.000
What you're going to see is two pictures,

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:13.000
one of which is slightly different from the other.

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:16.000
You see here the red roof and the gray roof,

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:18.000
and in between them there will be a mask,

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:22.000
which is just a blank screen, for about a quarter of a second.

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:24.000
So you'll see the first picture, then a mask,

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:26.000
then the second picture, then a mask.

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:30.000
And this will just continue, and your job as the subject

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:33.000
is to press the button when you see the change.

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:41.000
So, show the original picture for 240 milliseconds. Blank.

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:47.000
Show the next picture for 240 milliseconds. Blank.

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:51.000
And keep going, until the subject presses the button, saying,

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:53.000
"I see the change."

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:56.000
So now we're going to be subjects in the experiment.

00:17:56.000 --> 00:18:05.000
We're going to start easy. Some examples.

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:07.000
No trouble there.

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:10.000
Can everybody see? All right.

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:14.000
Indeed, Rensink's subjects took only a little bit more

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:16.000
than a second to press the button.

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:22.000
Can you see that one?

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:32.000
2.9 seconds.

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:42.000
How many don't see it still?

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:44.000
What's on the roof of that barn?

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:47.000
(Laughter)

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:57.000
It's easy.

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:23.000
Is it a bridge or a dock?

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:31.000
There are a few more really dramatic ones, and then I'll close.

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:35.000
I want you to see a few that are particularly striking.

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:42.000
This one because it's so large and yet it's pretty hard to see.

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:45.000
Can you see it?

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:47.000
Audience: Yes.

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:50.000
Dan Dennett: See the shadows going back and forth? Pretty big.

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:02.000
So 15.5 seconds is the median time

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:04.000
for subjects in his experiment there.

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:07.000
I love this one. I'll end with this one,

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:10.000
just because it's such an obvious and important thing.

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:18.000
How many still don't see it? How many still don't see it?

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:21.000
How many engines on the wing of that Boeing?

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:22.000
(Laughter)

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:28.000
Right in the middle of the picture!

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:29.000
Thanks very much for your attention.

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:34.000
What I wanted to show you is that scientists,

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:38.000
using their from-the-outside, third-person methods,

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:40.000
can tell you things about your own consciousness

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:42.000
that you would never dream of,

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:44.000
and that, in fact, you're not the authority

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:46.000
on your own consciousness that you think you are.

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:48.000
And we're really making a lot of progress

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:51.000
on coming up with a theory of mind.

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:57.000
Jeff Hawkins, this morning, was describing his attempt

00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:01.000
to get theory, and a good, big theory, into the neuroscience.

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:06.000
And he's right. This is a problem.

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:08.000
Harvard Medical School once -- I was at a talk --

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:12.000
director of the lab said, "In our lab, we have a saying.

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:15.000
If you work on one neuron, that's neuroscience.

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:18.000
If you work on two neurons, that's psychology."

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:22.000
(Laughter)

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:25.000
We have to have more theory, and it can come as much from the top down.

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:27.000
Thank you very much.

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:31.000
(Applause)
