00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Restaurants and the food industry in general

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
are pretty much the most wasteful industry

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
in the world.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
For every calorie of food that we consume here in Britain today,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
10 calories are taken to produce it.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
That's a lot.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
I want to take something rather humble

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
to discuss.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
I found this in the farmers' market today,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
and if anybody wants to take it home and mash it later, you're very welcome to.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
The humble potato --

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
and I've spent a long time, 25 years, preparing these.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
And it pretty much goes through

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
eight different forms in its lifetime.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
First of all, it's planted, and that takes energy.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
It grows and is nurtured.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
It's then harvested.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
It's then distributed,

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
and distribution is a massive issue.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
It's then sold and bought,

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
and it's then delivered to me.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
I basically take it, prepare it,

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
and then people consume it -- hopefully they enjoy it.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
The last stage is basically waste,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
and this is is pretty much where everybody disregards it.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
There are different types of waste.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
There's a waste of time; there's a waste of space; there's a waste of energy;

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
and there's a waste of waste.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
And every business I've been working on

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
over the past five years,

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
I'm trying to lower each one of these elements.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
Okay, so you ask what a sustainable restaurant looks like.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
Basically a restaurant just like any other.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
This is the restaurant, Acorn House.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
Front and back.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
So let me run you through a few ideas.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
Floor: sustainable, recyclable.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
Chairs: recycled and recyclable.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
Tables: Forestry Commission.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
This is Norwegian Forestry Commission wood.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
This bench, although it was uncomfortable for my mom --

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
she didn't like sitting on it,

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
so she went and bought these cushions for me from a local jumble sale --

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
reusing, a job that was pretty good.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
I hate waste, especially walls.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
If they're not working, put a shelf on it, which I did,

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000
and that shows all the customers my products.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
The whole business is run on sustainable energy.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
This is powered by wind. All of the lights are daylight bulbs.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
Paint is all low-volume chemical,

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
which is very important when you're working in the room all the time.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
I was experimenting with these -- I don't know if you can see it --

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
but there's a work surface there.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
And that's a plastic polymer.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
And I was thinking, well I'm trying to think nature, nature, nature.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
But I thought, no, no, experiment with resins,

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
experiment with polymers.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
Will they outlive me? They probably might.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
Right, here's a reconditioned coffee machine.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000
It actually looks better than a brand new one -- so looking good there.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000
Now reusing is vital.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
And we filter our own water.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
We put them in bottles, refrigerate them,

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
and then we reuse that bottle again and again and again.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
Here's a great little example.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
If you can see this orange tree, it's actually growing in a car tire,

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
which has been turned inside out and sewn up.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000
It's got my compost in it, which is growing an orange tree, which is great.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000
This is the kitchen, which is in the same room.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
I basically created a menu that allowed people

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
to choose the amount and volume of food

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
that they wanted to consume.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
Rather than me putting a dish down,

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
they were allowed to help themselves to as much or as little as they wanted.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
Okay, it's a small kitchen. It's about five square meters.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
It serves 220 people a day.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
We generate quite a lot of waste.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
This is the waste room.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
You can't get rid of waste.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000
But this story's not about eliminating it, it's about minimizing it.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000
In here, I have produce and boxes

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
that are unavoidable.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000
I put my food waste into this dehydrating, desiccating macerator --

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000
turns food into an inner material,

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000
which I can store and then compost later.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000
I compost it in this garden.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000
All of the soil you can see there is basically my food,

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
which is generated by the restaurant,

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
and it's growing in these tubs, which I made out of storm-felled trees

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.000
and wine casks and all kinds of things.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000
Three compost bins --

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000
go through about 70 kilos of raw vegetable waste a week --

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000
really good, makes fantastic compost.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000
A couple of wormeries in there too.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000
And actually one of the wormeries

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000
was a big wormery. I had a lot of worms in it.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000
And I tried taking the dried food waste,

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000
putting it to the worms, going, "There you go, dinner."

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000
It was like vegetable jerky,

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000
and killed all of them.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000
I don't know how many worms [were] in there,

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.000
but I've got some heavy karma coming, I tell you.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000
(Laughter)

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000
What you're seeing here is a water filtration system.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000
This takes the water out of the restaurant,

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000
runs it through these stone beds -- this is going to be mint in there --

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000
and I sort of water the garden with it.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000
And I ultimately want to recycle that, put it back into the loos,

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000
maybe wash hands with it, I don't know.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000
So, water is a very important aspect.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000
I started meditating on that

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.000
and created a restaurant called Waterhouse.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000
If I could get Waterhouse to be a no-carbon restaurant

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.000
that is consuming no gas to start with, that would be great.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000
I managed to do it.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000
This restaurant looks a little bit like Acorn House --

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000
same chairs, same tables.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.000
They're all English and a little bit more sustainable.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000
But this is an electrical restaurant.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000
The whole thing is electric, the restaurant and the kitchen.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000
And it's run on hydroelectricity,

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000
so I've gone from air to water.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.000
Now it's important to understand

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000
that this room

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000
is cooled by water, heated by water,

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000
filters its own water,

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000
and it's powered by water.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000
It literally is Waterhouse.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000
The air handling system inside it --

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000
I got rid of air-conditioning

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000
because I thought there was too much consumption going on there.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000
This is basically air-handling.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000
I'm taking the temperature of the canal outside,

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000
pumping it through the heat exchange mechanism,

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000
it's turning through these amazing sails on the roof,

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.000
and that, in turn, is falling softly onto the people in the restaurant,

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.000
cooling them, or heating them, as the need may be.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000
And this is an English willow air diffuser,

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000
and that's softly moving

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000
that air current through the room.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.000
Very advanced, no air-conditioning -- I love it.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000
In the canal, which is just outside the restaurant,

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000
there is hundreds of meters of coil piping.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000
This takes the temperature of the canal

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000
and turns it into this four-degrees of heat exchange.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.000
I have no idea how it works, but I paid a lot of money for it.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.000
(Laughter)

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000
And what's great is one of the chefs who works in that restaurant

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.000
lives on this boat -- it's off-grid; it generates all its own power.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.000
He's growing all his own fruit, and that's fantastic.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.000
There's no accident in names of these restaurants.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.000
Acorn House is the element of wood; Waterhouse is the element of water;

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.000
and I'm thinking, well, I'm going to be making

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000
five restaurants based

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:00.000
on the five Chinese medicine acupuncture specialities.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000
I've got water and wood. I'm just about to do fire.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000
I've got metal and earth to come.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.000
So you've got to watch your space for that.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000
Okay. So this is my next project.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000
Five weeks old,

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.000
it's my baby, and it's hurting real bad.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000
The People's Supermarket.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.000
So basically, the restaurants only really hit

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.000
people who believed in what I was doing anyway.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.000
What I needed to do was get food out

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.000
to a broader spectrum of people.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:28.000
So people -- i.e., perhaps, more working-class --

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000
or perhaps people who actually believe in a cooperative.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000
This is a social enterprise,

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.000
not-for-profit cooperative supermarket.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.000
It really is about the social disconnect

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000
between food, communities

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.000
in urban settings

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.000
and their relationship to rural growers --

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.000
connecting communities in London to rural growers.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000
Really important.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000
So I'm committing to potatoes; I'm committing to milk;

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:52.000
I'm committing to leeks and broccoli -- all very important stuff.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000
I've kept the tiles; I've kept the floors;

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000
I've kept the trunking; I've got in some recycled fridges;

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.000
I've got some recycled tills; I've got some recycled trolleys.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000
I mean, the whole thing is is super-sustainable.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.000
In fact, I'm trying and I'm going to make this

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.000
the most sustainable supermarket in the world.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.000
That's zero food waste.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.000
And no one's doing that just yet.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.000
In fact, Sainsbury's, if you're watching,

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.000
let's have a go. Try it on.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.000
I'm going to get there before you.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:19.000
So nature doesn't create waste

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.000
doesn't create waste as such.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.000
Everything in nature is used up in a closed continuous cycle

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.000
with waste being the end of the beginning,

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.000
and that's been something that's been nurturing me for some time,

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.000
and it's an important statement to understand.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.000
If we don't stand up

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.000
and make a difference

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:40.000
and think about sustainable food,

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.000
think about the sustainable nature of it,

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.000
then we may fail.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.000
But, I wanted to get up and show you

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.000
that we can do it if we're more responsible.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:51.000
Environmentally conscious businesses are doable.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:54.000
They're here. You can see I've done three so far;

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.000
I've got a few more to go.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.000
The idea is embryonic.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.000
I think it's important.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:04.000
I think that if we reduce, reuse, refuse

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.000
and recycle -- right at the end there --

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:09.000
recycling is the last point I want to make;

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:12.000
but it's the four R's, rather than the three R's --

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.000
then I think we're going to be on our way.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:17.000
So these three are not perfect -- they're ideas.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:20.000
I think that there are many problems to come,

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:23.000
but with help, I'm sure I'm going to find solutions.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.000
And I hope you all take part.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.000
Thank you very much. (Applause)
