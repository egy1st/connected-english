WEBVTT

00:00:01.063 --> 00:00:04.700
I'm not quite sure whether
I really want to see a snare drum

00:00:04.724 --> 00:00:06.796
at nine o'clock or so in the morning.

00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:08.218
(Laughter)

00:00:08.242 --> 00:00:12.312
But anyway, it's just great
to see such a full theater,

00:00:12.336 --> 00:00:15.621
and really, I must thank
Herbie Hancock and his colleagues

00:00:15.645 --> 00:00:18.149
for such a great presentation.

00:00:18.173 --> 00:00:21.244
(Applause)

00:00:21.268 --> 00:00:23.454
One of the interesting things, of course,

00:00:23.478 --> 00:00:30.431
is the combination of that raw hand
on the instrument and technology,

00:00:30.911 --> 00:00:35.551
and what he said about listening
to our young people.

00:00:35.575 --> 00:00:39.273
Of course, my job is all about listening.

00:00:40.094 --> 00:00:46.039
And my aim, really,
is to teach the world to listen.

00:00:46.063 --> 00:00:49.648
That's my only real aim in life.

00:00:50.394 --> 00:00:56.531
And it sounds quite simple,
but actually, it's quite a big, big job.

00:00:56.555 --> 00:01:01.825
Because you know, when you look
at a piece of music, for example,

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:05.308
if I just open my little motorbike bag --

00:01:06.647 --> 00:01:09.655
we have here, hopefully,

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:15.304
a piece of music that is full
of little black dots on the page.

00:01:16.494 --> 00:01:20.260
And, you know, we open it up ...

00:01:22.732 --> 00:01:24.006
And I read the music.

00:01:24.554 --> 00:01:28.268
So technically, I can actually read this.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.976
I will follow the instructions,
the tempo markings, the dynamics.

00:01:33.586 --> 00:01:36.771
I will do exactly as I'm told.

00:01:37.717 --> 00:01:41.109
And so therefore, because time is short,

00:01:41.133 --> 00:01:48.032
if I just played you, literally,
the first, maybe, two lines or so --

00:01:48.738 --> 00:01:52.234
It's very straightforward; there's nothing
too difficult about the piece.

00:01:52.258 --> 00:01:55.566
But here, I'm being told
that the piece of music is very quick.

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:59.556
I'm being told where to play on the drum.

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:02.496
I'm being told which part
of the stick to use.

00:02:03.847 --> 00:02:06.445
And I'm being told the dynamic.

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:11.070
And I'm also being told
that the drum is without snares.

00:02:11.094 --> 00:02:14.106
Snares on, snares off.

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:19.982
So therefore, if I translate
this piece of music,

00:02:20.006 --> 00:02:22.006
we have this idea.

00:02:23.074 --> 00:02:25.278
(Drum sounds)

00:02:50.823 --> 00:02:53.242
(Drum sounds end)

00:02:53.266 --> 00:02:54.533
And so on.

00:02:54.557 --> 00:02:58.039
My career would probably last
about five years.

00:02:58.063 --> 00:02:59.067
(Laughter)

00:02:59.091 --> 00:03:03.614
However, what I have to do as a musician

00:03:03.638 --> 00:03:07.746
is do everything that is not on the music;

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:12.774
everything that there isn't time
to learn from a teacher,

00:03:12.798 --> 00:03:16.358
or to talk about, even, from a teacher.

00:03:16.382 --> 00:03:21.235
But it's the things you notice when
you're not actually with your instrument

00:03:21.259 --> 00:03:26.506
that, in fact, become so interesting,
and that you want to explore

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:29.998
through this tiny, tiny surface of a drum.

00:03:30.022 --> 00:03:32.723
So there, we experience the translation.

00:03:32.747 --> 00:03:36.217
Now we'll experience the interpretation.

00:03:37.082 --> 00:03:38.852
(Drum sounds)

00:04:18.976 --> 00:04:20.976
(Drum sounds end)

00:04:22.513 --> 00:04:29.513
(Applause)

00:04:30.058 --> 00:04:32.769
Now my career may last a little longer.

00:04:32.793 --> 00:04:34.120
(Laughter)

00:04:34.144 --> 00:04:37.429
But in a way, you know,
it's the same if I look at you

00:04:37.453 --> 00:04:41.793
and I see a nice, bright young lady
with a pink top on.

00:04:41.817 --> 00:04:45.235
I see that you're clutching
a teddy bear, etc., etc.

00:04:45.259 --> 00:04:49.817
So I get a basic idea
as to what you might be about,

00:04:49.841 --> 00:04:54.209
what you might like, what you might do
as a profession, etc., etc.

00:04:54.642 --> 00:05:01.003
However, that's just the initial idea
I may have that we all get

00:05:01.027 --> 00:05:04.609
when we actually look
and we try to interpret.

00:05:04.633 --> 00:05:06.933
But actually it's so unbelievably shallow.

00:05:06.957 --> 00:05:09.862
In the same way, I look
at the music; I get a basic idea;

00:05:09.886 --> 00:05:14.180
I wonder what technically might be hard,
or, you know, what I want to do.

00:05:14.204 --> 00:05:15.694
Just the basic feeling.

00:05:15.718 --> 00:05:18.381
However, that is simply not enough.

00:05:18.405 --> 00:05:22.719
And I think what Herbie said:
please listen, listen.

00:05:22.743 --> 00:05:26.379
We have to listen
to ourselves, first of all.

00:05:26.403 --> 00:05:30.148
If I play, for example,
holding the stick --

00:05:30.172 --> 00:05:33.225
where literally I do not let go
of the stick --

00:05:33.249 --> 00:05:35.814
(Drum sound)

00:05:35.838 --> 00:05:39.655
you'll experience quite a lot
of shock coming up through the arm.

00:05:39.679 --> 00:05:42.004
And you feel really quite --
believe it or not --

00:05:42.028 --> 00:05:45.271
detached from the instrument
and from the stick,

00:05:45.295 --> 00:05:49.417
even though I'm actually holding
the stick quite tightly.

00:05:49.441 --> 00:05:50.866
(Drum sound)

00:05:50.890 --> 00:05:54.847
By holding it tightly,
I feel strangely more detached.

00:05:54.871 --> 00:05:56.588
If I just simply let go

00:05:56.612 --> 00:06:01.807
and allow my hand, my arm,
to be more of a support system,

00:06:01.831 --> 00:06:03.029
suddenly --

00:06:03.053 --> 00:06:05.067
(Drum sound)

00:06:05.091 --> 00:06:08.548
I have more dynamic with less effort.

00:06:08.572 --> 00:06:09.747
Much more --

00:06:09.771 --> 00:06:11.522
(Drum sound)

00:06:11.546 --> 00:06:14.479
and I just feel, at last,
one with the stick

00:06:14.503 --> 00:06:16.162
and one with the drum.

00:06:16.186 --> 00:06:18.299
And I'm doing far, far less.

00:06:18.323 --> 00:06:21.735
So in the same way that I need
time with this instrument,

00:06:21.759 --> 00:06:27.086
I need time with people
in order to interpret them.

00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:29.798
Not just translate them,
but interpret them.

00:06:29.822 --> 00:06:36.009
If, for example, I play just
a few bars of a piece of music

00:06:37.289 --> 00:06:42.679
for which I think of myself
as a technician --

00:06:42.703 --> 00:06:46.959
that is, someone who is basically
a percussion player --

00:06:46.983 --> 00:06:49.229
(Marimba sounds)

00:06:57.973 --> 00:06:59.870
(Marimba sounds end)

00:06:59.894 --> 00:07:03.082
And so on, if I think of myself
as a musician --

00:07:03.106 --> 00:07:05.174
(Marimba sounds)

00:07:22.867 --> 00:07:24.910
(Marimba sounds end)

00:07:24.934 --> 00:07:26.108
And so on.

00:07:26.132 --> 00:07:29.994
There is a little bit of a difference
there that is worth just --

00:07:30.018 --> 00:07:32.569
(Applause)

00:07:32.593 --> 00:07:33.976
thinking about.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:37.909
And I remember when I was 12 years old,

00:07:37.933 --> 00:07:41.051
and I started playing timpani
and percussion,

00:07:41.075 --> 00:07:43.505
and my teacher said,

00:07:43.529 --> 00:07:49.182
"Well, how are we going to do this?
You know, music is about listening."

00:07:49.206 --> 00:07:53.877
And I said, "Yes, I agree with that,
so what's the problem?"

00:07:53.901 --> 00:07:56.320
And he said, "Well,
how are you going to hear this?

00:07:56.344 --> 00:07:57.902
How are you going to hear that?"

00:07:57.926 --> 00:08:00.008
And I said, "Well, how do you hear it?"

00:08:00.507 --> 00:08:03.976
He said, "Well, I think
I hear it through here."

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:09.374
And I said, "Well, I think I do too,
but I also hear it through my hands,

00:08:09.398 --> 00:08:12.937
through my arms, cheekbones, my scalp,

00:08:12.961 --> 00:08:15.978
my tummy, my chest, my legs and so on."

00:08:16.002 --> 00:08:20.834
And so we began our lessons
every single time

00:08:20.858 --> 00:08:24.800
tuning drums, in particular,
the kettle drums, or timpani

00:08:24.824 --> 00:08:29.837
to such a narrow pitch interval,
so something like --

00:08:30.606 --> 00:08:33.218
(Marimba sounds)

00:08:35.040 --> 00:08:36.213
that of a difference.

00:08:36.237 --> 00:08:37.439
Then gradually:

00:08:37.463 --> 00:08:38.620
(Marimba sounds)

00:08:38.644 --> 00:08:39.824
And gradually:

00:08:39.848 --> 00:08:41.639
(Marimba sounds)

00:08:41.663 --> 00:08:45.722
And it's amazing that when you do
open your body up,

00:08:45.746 --> 00:08:49.721
and open your hand up to allow
the vibration to come through,

00:08:49.745 --> 00:08:52.068
that in fact the tiny, tiny difference --

00:08:52.092 --> 00:08:54.151
(Marimba sounds)

00:08:54.175 --> 00:09:00.257
can be felt with just the tiniest
part of your finger, there.

00:09:00.281 --> 00:09:03.147
And so what we would do
is that I would put my hands

00:09:03.171 --> 00:09:05.486
on the wall of the music room,

00:09:05.510 --> 00:09:10.704
and together, we would "listen"
to the sounds of the instruments,

00:09:10.728 --> 00:09:14.564
and really try to connect
with those sounds

00:09:14.588 --> 00:09:18.981
far, far more broadly
than simply depending on the ear.

00:09:19.005 --> 00:09:23.648
Because of course, the ear
is subject to all sorts of things.

00:09:23.672 --> 00:09:26.641
The room we happen to be in,
the amplification,

00:09:26.665 --> 00:09:29.400
the quality of the instrument,
the type of sticks --

00:09:29.424 --> 00:09:31.505
(Marimba sounds)

00:09:35.844 --> 00:09:37.791
(Marimba sounds end)

00:09:37.815 --> 00:09:39.634
Etc., etc., they're all different.

00:09:39.658 --> 00:09:41.658
(Marimba sounds)

00:09:44.117 --> 00:09:46.214
(Marimba sounds end)

00:09:46.238 --> 00:09:50.823
Same amount of weight,
but different sound colors.

00:09:50.847 --> 00:09:53.751
And that's basically what we are;
we're just human beings,

00:09:53.775 --> 00:09:56.940
but we all have our own
little sound colors, as it were,

00:09:56.964 --> 00:10:00.613
that make up these extraordinary
personalities and characters

00:10:00.637 --> 00:10:02.510
and interests and things.

00:10:02.534 --> 00:10:05.534
And as I grew older, I then auditioned

00:10:05.558 --> 00:10:07.976
for the Royal Academy of Music in London,

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:12.274
and they said, "Well, no, we won't
accept you, because we haven't a clue,

00:10:12.298 --> 00:10:16.951
you know, of the future
of a so-called 'deaf musician.'"

00:10:16.975 --> 00:10:21.502
And I just couldn't quite accept that.

00:10:21.526 --> 00:10:28.094
And so therefore, I said to them,
"Well, look, if you refuse --

00:10:28.118 --> 00:10:31.443
if you refuse me through those reasons,

00:10:31.467 --> 00:10:36.235
as opposed to the ability to perform

00:10:36.259 --> 00:10:42.976
and to understand and love
the art of creating sound --

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:49.239
then we have to think very, very hard
about the people you do actually accept."

00:10:49.263 --> 00:10:53.521
And as a result,
once we got over a little hurdle,

00:10:53.545 --> 00:10:55.554
and having to audition twice,

00:10:55.578 --> 00:10:57.793
they accepted me.

00:10:57.817 --> 00:10:59.183
And not only that,

00:10:59.207 --> 00:11:04.850
what had happened was that it changed
the whole role of the music institutions

00:11:04.874 --> 00:11:06.826
throughout the United Kingdom.

00:11:06.850 --> 00:11:10.798
Under no circumstances were they to refuse

00:11:10.822 --> 00:11:14.737
any application whatsoever

00:11:14.761 --> 00:11:18.269
on the basis of whether someone
had no arms, no legs --

00:11:18.293 --> 00:11:22.821
they could still perhaps play a wind
instrument if it was supported on a stand.

00:11:23.368 --> 00:11:29.623
No circumstances at all
were used to refuse any entry.

00:11:29.647 --> 00:11:34.485
And every single entry
had to be listened to, experienced,

00:11:34.509 --> 00:11:37.066
and then, based on the musical ability,

00:11:37.090 --> 00:11:42.342
then that person
could either enter or not.

00:11:42.366 --> 00:11:45.520
And so therefore, this in turn meant

00:11:45.544 --> 00:11:49.181
that there was an extremely
interesting bunch of students

00:11:49.205 --> 00:11:52.555
who arrived in these various
music institutions,

00:11:52.579 --> 00:11:57.068
and I have to say, many of them now
in the professional orchestras

00:11:57.092 --> 00:11:59.071
throughout the world.

00:11:59.095 --> 00:12:01.781
The interesting thing
about this as well, though --

00:12:01.805 --> 00:12:05.976
(Applause)

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:12.790
is quite simply that not only were people
connected with sound --

00:12:12.814 --> 00:12:14.325
which is basically all of us --

00:12:14.349 --> 00:12:19.271
we well know that music
really is our daily medicine.

00:12:19.295 --> 00:12:21.976
I say "music," but actually
I mean "sound."

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:26.625
Because some of the extraordinary
things I've experienced as a musician --

00:12:26.649 --> 00:12:30.788
when you may have a 15-year-old lad

00:12:30.812 --> 00:12:35.541
who has got the most
incredible challenges,

00:12:35.565 --> 00:12:38.302
who may not be able
to control his movements,

00:12:38.326 --> 00:12:41.339
who may be deaf,
who may be blind, etc., etc. --

00:12:41.363 --> 00:12:47.393
suddenly, if that young lad
sits close to this instrument,

00:12:47.417 --> 00:12:50.228
and perhaps even lies
underneath the marimba,

00:12:50.252 --> 00:12:55.976
and you play something
that's so incredibly organ-like, almost --

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.860
I don't really have
the right sticks, perhaps --

00:12:58.884 --> 00:13:02.707
but something like this --
let me change --

00:13:04.935 --> 00:13:07.473
(Soft marimba sounds)

00:13:50.167 --> 00:13:52.802
(Soft marimba sounds end)

00:13:52.826 --> 00:13:55.708
Something that's so unbelievably simple --

00:13:55.732 --> 00:14:00.052
but he would be experiencing
something that I wouldn't be,

00:14:00.076 --> 00:14:02.494
because I'm on top of the sound.

00:14:02.518 --> 00:14:04.784
I have the sound coming this way.

00:14:04.808 --> 00:14:08.366
He would have the sound
coming through the resonators.

00:14:08.390 --> 00:14:11.525
If there were no resonators
on here, we would have:

00:14:11.894 --> 00:14:16.967
(Marimba sounds)

00:14:18.106 --> 00:14:20.425
So he would have a fullness of sound

00:14:20.449 --> 00:14:23.447
that those of you in the front few rows
wouldn't experience,

00:14:23.471 --> 00:14:26.616
those of you in the back few rows
wouldn't experience, either.

00:14:26.640 --> 00:14:29.733
Every single one of us,
depending on where we're sitting,

00:14:29.757 --> 00:14:33.534
will experience this sound
quite, quite differently.

00:14:33.558 --> 00:14:36.428
And of course, being
the participator of the sound,

00:14:36.452 --> 00:14:41.278
and that is, starting from the idea
of what type of sound

00:14:41.302 --> 00:14:44.587
I want to produce,
for example, this sound:

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:47.000
(No sound)

00:14:51.171 --> 00:14:52.335
Can you hear anything?

00:14:54.108 --> 00:14:56.854
Exactly -- because
I'm not even touching it.

00:14:56.878 --> 00:14:58.403
(Laughter)

00:14:58.427 --> 00:15:03.054
But yet, we get the sensation
of something happening.

00:15:03.078 --> 00:15:05.637
In the same way
that when I see a tree moves,

00:15:05.661 --> 00:15:09.879
then I imagine that tree
making a rustling sound.

00:15:09.903 --> 00:15:11.129
Do you see what I mean?

00:15:11.153 --> 00:15:15.270
Whatever the eye sees,
then there's always sound happening.

00:15:15.294 --> 00:15:19.489
So there's always, always that huge --

00:15:19.513 --> 00:15:23.799
I mean, just this kaleidoscope
of things to draw from.

00:15:23.823 --> 00:15:29.792
So all of my performances
are based on entirely what I experience,

00:15:29.816 --> 00:15:32.312
and not by learning a piece of music,

00:15:32.336 --> 00:15:34.538
putting on someone else's
interpretation of it,

00:15:34.562 --> 00:15:37.741
buying all the CDs possible
of that particular piece of music,

00:15:37.765 --> 00:15:39.131
and so on and so forth,

00:15:39.155 --> 00:15:45.507
because that isn't giving me enough
of something that is so raw and so basic,

00:15:45.531 --> 00:15:50.658
and something that I can fully
experience the journey of.

00:15:50.682 --> 00:15:54.909
So it may be that, in certain halls,

00:15:54.933 --> 00:15:59.701
this dynamic may well work.

00:16:00.169 --> 00:16:02.461
(Soft marimba sounds)

00:16:07.370 --> 00:16:09.372
(Soft marimba sounds end)

00:16:09.396 --> 00:16:10.928
It may be that in other halls,

00:16:10.952 --> 00:16:14.187
they're simply not going
to experience that at all,

00:16:14.211 --> 00:16:18.419
and so therefore, my level of soft,
gentle playing may have to be --

00:16:18.443 --> 00:16:21.602
(Marimba sounds)

00:16:40.470 --> 00:16:42.471
(Marimba sounds end)

00:16:42.495 --> 00:16:43.837
Do you see what I mean?

00:16:43.861 --> 00:16:50.119
So, because of this explosion
in access to sound,

00:16:50.143 --> 00:16:52.654
especially through the Deaf community,

00:16:52.678 --> 00:16:57.105
this has not only affected
how music institutions,

00:16:57.129 --> 00:17:03.898
how schools for the deaf treat sound,
and not just as a means of therapy --

00:17:03.922 --> 00:17:06.535
although, of course,
being a participator of music,

00:17:06.559 --> 00:17:09.157
that definitely is the case as well --

00:17:09.181 --> 00:17:14.280
but it's meant that acousticians
have had to really think

00:17:14.304 --> 00:17:18.326
about the types of halls
they put together.

00:17:18.350 --> 00:17:20.814
There are so few halls in this world

00:17:20.838 --> 00:17:26.155
that actually have
very good acoustics, dare I say.

00:17:26.179 --> 00:17:31.764
But by that I mean, where you can
absolutely do anything you imagine.

00:17:31.788 --> 00:17:36.606
The tiniest, softest, softest sound
to something that is so broad,

00:17:36.630 --> 00:17:39.352
so huge, so incredible.

00:17:39.376 --> 00:17:40.770
There's always something:

00:17:40.794 --> 00:17:43.298
it may sound good up there,
may not be so good there;

00:17:43.322 --> 00:17:45.465
it may be great there,
but terrible up there;

00:17:45.489 --> 00:17:49.673
maybe terrible over there,
but not too bad there, etc., etc.

00:17:49.697 --> 00:17:54.119
So to find an actual hall is incredible --

00:17:54.143 --> 00:17:58.219
for which you can play
exactly what you imagine,

00:17:58.243 --> 00:18:01.350
without it being cosmetically enhanced.

00:18:01.374 --> 00:18:06.431
So therefore, acousticians
are actually in conversation

00:18:06.455 --> 00:18:09.750
with people who are hearing impaired,

00:18:09.774 --> 00:18:14.625
and who are participators of sound.

00:18:14.649 --> 00:18:16.476
And this is quite interesting.

00:18:16.500 --> 00:18:20.487
I cannot give you any detail

00:18:20.511 --> 00:18:24.248
as far as what is actually happening
with those halls,

00:18:24.272 --> 00:18:28.380
but it's just the fact
that they are going to a group of people

00:18:28.404 --> 00:18:32.350
for whom so many years, we've been saying,

00:18:32.374 --> 00:18:35.715
"Well, how on earth can they experience
music? They're deaf."

00:18:35.739 --> 00:18:39.054
We go like that, and we imagine
that's what deafness is about.

00:18:39.078 --> 00:18:42.214
Or we go like that, and we imagine
that's what blindness is about.

00:18:42.238 --> 00:18:46.060
If we see someone in a wheelchair,
we assume they cannot walk.

00:18:46.084 --> 00:18:49.608
It may be that they can walk
three, four, five steps.

00:18:49.632 --> 00:18:52.483
That, to them, means they can walk.

00:18:53.594 --> 00:18:56.633
In a year's time,
it could be two extra steps.

00:18:57.299 --> 00:19:00.052
In another year's time, three extra steps.

00:19:00.076 --> 00:19:04.779
Those are hugely important
aspects to think about.

00:19:04.803 --> 00:19:08.976
So when we do listen to each other,

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:12.689
it's unbelievably important for us

00:19:12.713 --> 00:19:17.331
to really test our listening skills,

00:19:17.355 --> 00:19:20.827
to really use our bodies
as a resonating chamber,

00:19:20.851 --> 00:19:22.500
to stop the judgment.

00:19:22.524 --> 00:19:26.395
For me, as a musician who deals
with 99 percent of new music,

00:19:26.419 --> 00:19:28.343
it's very easy for me to say,

00:19:28.367 --> 00:19:31.968
"Oh yes, I like that piece.
No, I don't like that piece," and so on.

00:19:31.992 --> 00:19:37.121
And I just find that I have to give
those pieces of music real time.

00:19:37.145 --> 00:19:40.418
It may be that the chemistry
isn't quite right between myself

00:19:40.442 --> 00:19:42.219
and that particular piece of music,

00:19:42.243 --> 00:19:46.725
but that doesn't mean I have the right
to say it's a bad piece of music.

00:19:47.077 --> 00:19:52.177
And you know, one of the great things
about being a musician

00:19:52.201 --> 00:19:55.757
is that it is so unbelievably fluid.

00:19:55.781 --> 00:20:00.185
So there are no rules, no right,
no wrong, this way, that way.

00:20:00.209 --> 00:20:05.037
If I asked you to clap --
maybe I can do this.

00:20:05.061 --> 00:20:11.435
If I can just say, "Please clap
and create the sound of thunder."

00:20:11.459 --> 00:20:14.758
I'm assuming we've all
experienced thunder.

00:20:14.782 --> 00:20:16.364
Now, I don't mean just the sound;

00:20:16.388 --> 00:20:21.305
I mean really listen
to that thunder within yourselves.

00:20:21.329 --> 00:20:23.787
And please try to create that
through your clapping.

00:20:23.811 --> 00:20:25.760
Try, just -- please try.

00:20:25.784 --> 00:20:29.053
(Loud clapping sounds)

00:20:33.561 --> 00:20:34.711
(Clapping ends)

00:20:35.103 --> 00:20:36.461
Snow.

00:20:36.485 --> 00:20:38.621
(Laughter)

00:20:38.645 --> 00:20:39.813
Snow.

00:20:39.837 --> 00:20:42.073
(Soft clapping sounds)

00:20:42.097 --> 00:20:43.642
Have you ever heard snow?

00:20:43.666 --> 00:20:44.817
Audience: No.

00:20:44.841 --> 00:20:46.999
Evelyn Glennie: Well, then, stop clapping.

00:20:47.023 --> 00:20:48.422
(Laughter)

00:20:48.446 --> 00:20:51.651
Try again. Try again: snow.

00:20:52.016 --> 00:20:55.060
(No sound)

00:20:55.822 --> 00:20:57.426
See, you're awake.

00:20:58.095 --> 00:20:59.342
Rain.

00:20:59.714 --> 00:21:01.403
(Light clapping sounds)

00:21:01.887 --> 00:21:03.340
EG: (Laughs)

00:21:04.354 --> 00:21:07.084
Not bad. Not bad.

00:21:07.108 --> 00:21:11.864
The interesting thing here, though,
is that I asked a group of kids

00:21:11.888 --> 00:21:13.591
not so long ago

00:21:13.615 --> 00:21:15.780
exactly the same question.

00:21:15.804 --> 00:21:19.183
Now -- great imagination,
thank you very much.

00:21:19.207 --> 00:21:22.029
However, not one of you got out
of your seats to think,

00:21:22.053 --> 00:21:23.720
"Right! How can I clap?

00:21:23.744 --> 00:21:24.966
OK, maybe:

00:21:24.990 --> 00:21:27.499
(Clapping sounds)

00:21:27.523 --> 00:21:30.355
Maybe I can use my jewelry
to create extra sounds.

00:21:30.379 --> 00:21:34.415
Maybe I can use the other parts
of my body to create extra sounds."

00:21:34.439 --> 00:21:39.832
Not a single one of you thought
about clapping in a slightly different way

00:21:39.856 --> 00:21:42.974
other than sitting in your seats
there and using two hands.

00:21:42.998 --> 00:21:45.143
In the same way, when we listen to music,

00:21:45.167 --> 00:21:49.108
we assume that it's all being
fed through here.

00:21:49.132 --> 00:21:51.676
This is how we experience music.

00:21:51.700 --> 00:21:53.371
Of course, it's not.

00:21:53.395 --> 00:21:56.218
We experience thunder, thunder, thunder.

00:21:56.242 --> 00:21:57.439
Think, think, think.

00:21:57.463 --> 00:21:59.353
Listen, listen, listen.

00:21:59.852 --> 00:22:03.599
Now, what can we do with thunder?

00:22:04.266 --> 00:22:09.660
I remember my teacher, when I first
started, my very first lesson,

00:22:09.684 --> 00:22:13.069
I was all prepared
with sticks, ready to go.

00:22:13.093 --> 00:22:17.889
And instead of him saying,
"OK, Evelyn, please, feet slightly apart,

00:22:17.913 --> 00:22:23.753
arms at a more or less 90-degree angle,
sticks in a more or less V shape,

00:22:23.777 --> 00:22:26.821
keep this amount of space here, etc.

00:22:26.845 --> 00:22:29.399
Please keep your back straight,
etc., etc., etc." --

00:22:29.423 --> 00:22:33.587
where I was just probably going to end up
absolutely rigid, frozen,

00:22:33.611 --> 00:22:35.620
and I would not be able to strike the drum

00:22:35.644 --> 00:22:37.864
because I was thinking
of so many other things,

00:22:37.888 --> 00:22:40.451
he said, "Evelyn, take this drum
away for seven days,

00:22:40.475 --> 00:22:42.260
and I'll see you next week."

00:22:42.284 --> 00:22:44.689
So -- heavens! What was I to do?

00:22:44.713 --> 00:22:47.191
I no longer required the sticks.

00:22:47.215 --> 00:22:49.363
I wasn't allowed to have these sticks.

00:22:49.387 --> 00:22:53.024
I had to basically look
at this particular drum,

00:22:53.048 --> 00:22:54.721
see how it was made,

00:22:54.745 --> 00:22:57.761
what these little lugs did,
what the snares did.

00:22:57.785 --> 00:23:00.737
Turned it upside down,
experimented with the shell.

00:23:00.761 --> 00:23:02.474
(Drum sounds)

00:23:02.498 --> 00:23:03.844
Experimented with the head.

00:23:03.868 --> 00:23:05.330
(Drum sounds)

00:23:05.354 --> 00:23:07.134
Experimented with my body.

00:23:07.158 --> 00:23:08.952
(Drum sounds)

00:23:08.976 --> 00:23:10.800
Experimented with jewelry.

00:23:10.824 --> 00:23:12.912
Experimented with all sorts of things.

00:23:12.936 --> 00:23:16.315
(Drum sounds)

00:23:19.356 --> 00:23:21.832
(Drum sounds end)

00:23:23.182 --> 00:23:26.382
And of course, I returned
with all sorts of bruises.

00:23:26.406 --> 00:23:27.657
(Laughter)

00:23:27.681 --> 00:23:31.041
But nevertheless, it was such
an unbelievable experience,

00:23:31.065 --> 00:23:35.767
because where on earth are you going
to experience that in a piece of music?

00:23:35.791 --> 00:23:39.777
Where on earth are you going
to experience that in a study book?

00:23:39.801 --> 00:23:43.506
So we never, ever dealt
with actual study books.

00:23:43.530 --> 00:23:46.186
So for example,
one of the things that we learn

00:23:46.210 --> 00:23:50.894
when we are dealing
with being a percussion player

00:23:50.918 --> 00:23:52.277
as opposed to a musician,

00:23:52.301 --> 00:23:55.906
is basically, straightforward
single-stroke rolls.

00:23:55.930 --> 00:23:59.554
(Drum sounds)

00:23:59.578 --> 00:24:01.688
Like that, and then
we get a little faster --

00:24:01.712 --> 00:24:02.880
(Drum sounds)

00:24:02.904 --> 00:24:04.100
and a little faster --

00:24:04.124 --> 00:24:05.302
(Drum sounds)

00:24:05.326 --> 00:24:07.808
and a little faster,
and so on and so forth.

00:24:07.832 --> 00:24:09.271
What does this piece require?

00:24:09.295 --> 00:24:10.670
Single-stroke rolls.

00:24:10.694 --> 00:24:13.893
(Drum sound)

00:24:13.917 --> 00:24:17.379
So why can't I then do that
whilst learning a piece of music?

00:24:17.403 --> 00:24:20.221
And that's exactly what he did.

00:24:20.245 --> 00:24:25.595
And interestingly, the older I became,
and when I became a full-time student

00:24:25.619 --> 00:24:30.877
at a so-called "music institution,"
all of that went out of the window.

00:24:30.901 --> 00:24:33.642
We had to study from study books.

00:24:33.666 --> 00:24:37.767
And constantly, the question, "Well, why?
Why? What is this relating to?

00:24:37.791 --> 00:24:39.391
I need to play a piece of music."

00:24:39.415 --> 00:24:41.172
"Well, this will help your control."

00:24:41.196 --> 00:24:43.755
"Well, how? Why do I need to learn that?

00:24:43.779 --> 00:24:46.284
I need to relate it to a piece of music.

00:24:46.308 --> 00:24:48.870
You know, I need to say something.

00:24:48.894 --> 00:24:51.000
Why am I practicing paradiddles?

00:24:51.024 --> 00:24:55.006
(Drum sounds)

00:24:55.030 --> 00:24:58.897
Is it just literally for control,
for hand-stick control?

00:24:58.921 --> 00:25:00.305
Why am I doing that?

00:25:00.329 --> 00:25:02.729
I need to have the reason,

00:25:02.753 --> 00:25:08.334
and the reason has to be by saying
something through the music."

00:25:08.358 --> 00:25:12.851
And by saying something through music,
which basically is sound,

00:25:12.875 --> 00:25:17.247
we then can reach all sorts
of things to all sorts of people.

00:25:17.271 --> 00:25:21.520
But I don't want to take responsibility
of your emotional baggage.

00:25:21.544 --> 00:25:23.768
That's up to you,
when you walk through a hall,

00:25:23.792 --> 00:25:29.126
because that then determines
what and how we listen to certain things.

00:25:29.150 --> 00:25:34.431
I may feel sorrowful, or happy,
or exhilarated, or angry

00:25:34.455 --> 00:25:36.243
when I play certain pieces of music,

00:25:36.267 --> 00:25:41.144
but I'm not necessarily wanting you
to feel exactly the same thing.

00:25:41.168 --> 00:25:44.272
So please, the next time
you go to a concert,

00:25:44.296 --> 00:25:47.941
just allow your body to open up,

00:25:47.965 --> 00:25:51.047
allow your body to be
this resonating chamber.

00:25:51.071 --> 00:25:54.348
Be aware that you're not going
to experience the same thing

00:25:54.372 --> 00:25:56.078
as the performer is.

00:25:56.102 --> 00:25:59.842
The performer is in the worst possible
position for the actual sound,

00:25:59.866 --> 00:26:03.422
because they're hearing
the contact of the stick --

00:26:03.446 --> 00:26:04.958
(Drum sound)

00:26:04.982 --> 00:26:07.851
on the drum, or the mallet
on the bit of wood,

00:26:07.875 --> 00:26:10.062
or the bow on the string, etc.,

00:26:10.086 --> 00:26:14.224
or the breath that's creating
the sound from wind and brass.

00:26:14.248 --> 00:26:16.769
They're experiencing that rawness there.

00:26:16.793 --> 00:26:20.641
But yet they're experiencing
something so unbelievably pure,

00:26:20.665 --> 00:26:24.495
which is before the sound
is actually happening.

00:26:24.519 --> 00:26:31.075
Please take note of the life of the sound
after the actual initial strike,

00:26:31.099 --> 00:26:33.504
or breath, is being pulled.

00:26:33.528 --> 00:26:37.776
Just experience the whole
journey of that sound

00:26:37.800 --> 00:26:41.398
in the same way that I wished
I'd experienced the whole journey

00:26:41.422 --> 00:26:45.851
of this particular conference,
rather than just arriving last night.

00:26:45.875 --> 00:26:50.532
But I hope maybe we can share
one or two things as the day progresses.

00:26:50.556 --> 00:26:53.295
But thank you very much for having me!

00:26:53.319 --> 00:26:56.553
(Applause)

00:26:59.262 --> 00:27:00.960
(Applause ends)

00:27:12.957 --> 00:27:15.979
(Music)

00:31:37.631 --> 00:31:39.901
(Music ends)

00:31:43.244 --> 00:31:50.244
(Applause)
