WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
It sure used to be a lot easier to be from Iceland,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
because until a couple of years ago,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
people knew hardly anything about us,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
and I could basically come out here

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
and say only good things about us.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
But in the last couple of years

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
we've become infamous for a couple of things.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
First, of course, the economic meltdown.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
It actually got so bad

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
that somebody put our country up for sale on eBay.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
(Laughter)

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Ninety-nine pence was the starting price

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
and no reserve.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Then there was the volcano

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
that interrupted the travel plans

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
of almost all of you and many of your friends,

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
including President Obama.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
By the way, the pronunciation

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
is "Eyjafjallajokull."

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
None of your media got it right.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
(Laughter)

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
But I'm not here to share these stories

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
about these two things exactly.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
I'm here to tell you the story of Audur Capital,

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
which is a financial firm founded by me

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
and Kristin -- who you see in the picture --

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
in the spring of 2007,

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
just over a year before the economic collapse hit.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
Why would two women

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
who were enjoying successful careers in investment banking

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
in the corporate sector

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
leave to found a financial services firm?

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
Well let it suffice to say

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
that we felt a bit overwhelmed

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
with testosterone.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
And I'm not here to say

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
that men are to blame for the crisis

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
and what happened in my country.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
But I can surely tell you that in my country,

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
much like on Wall Street and the city of London and elsewhere,

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
men were at the helm

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
of the game of the financial sector,

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
and that kind of lack of diversity

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
and sameness

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
leads to disastrous problems.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
(Applause)

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
So we decided, a bit fed-up with this world

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000
and also with the strong feeling in our stomach

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
that this wasn't sustainable,

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
to found a financial services firm

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000
based on our values,

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
and we decided to incorporate feminine values

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
into the world of finance.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
Raised quite a few eyebrows in Iceland.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
We weren't known

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
as the typical "women" women

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
in Iceland up until then.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
So it was almost like coming out of the closet

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
to actually talk about the fact that we were women

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
and that we believed that we had a set of values

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000
and a way of doing business

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
that would be more sustainable

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
than what we had experienced until then.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
And we got a great group of people to join us --

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
principled people with great skills,

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
and investors with a vision

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
and values to match ours.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000
And together we got through the eye of the financial storm in Iceland

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000
without taking any direct losses to our equity

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
or to the funds of our clients.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
And although I want to thank

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
the talented people of our company

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
foremost for that --

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
and also there's a factor of luck and timing --

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
we are absolutely convinced

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000
that we did this because of our values.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000
So let me share with you our values.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
We believe in risk awareness.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
What does that mean?

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
We believe that you should always understand the risks that you're taking,

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
and we will not invest

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000
in things we don't understand.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
Not a complicated thing.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
But in 2007,

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000
at the height of the sub-prime

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000
and all the complicated financial structures,

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
it was quite opposite

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000
to the reckless risk-taking behaviors

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000
that we saw on the market.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
We also believe in straight-talking,

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000
telling it as it is,

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000
using simple language that people understand,

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000
telling people about the downsides

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.000
as well as the potential upsides,

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.000
and even telling the bad news that no one wants to utter,

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000
like our lack of belief in the sustainability

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000
of the Icelandic financial sector

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000
that already we had

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000
months before the collapse hit us.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.000
And, although we do work in the financial sector,

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000
where Excel is king,

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
we believe in emotional capital.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
And we believe

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000
that doing emotional due diligence

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000
is just as important

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000
as doing financial due diligence.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000
It is actually people

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000
that make money and lose money,

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.000
not Excel spreadsheets.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000
(Applause)

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000
Last, but not least,

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000
we believe in profit with principles.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000
We care how we make our profit.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.000
So while we want to make economic profit for ourselves and our customers,

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.000
we are willing to do it with a long-term view,

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.000
and we like to have a wider definition of profits

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.000
than just the economic profit in the next quarter.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000
So we like to see profits,

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000
plus positive social

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.000
and environmental benefits, when we invest.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000
But it wasn't just about the values,

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000
although we are convinced that they matter.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000
It was also about a business opportunity.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000
It's the female trend, and it's the sustainability trend,

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000
that are going to create

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000
some of the most interesting investment opportunities

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000
in the years to come.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000
The whole thing about the female trend

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000
is not about women being better than men;

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000
it is actually about

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000
women being different from men,

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.000
bringing different values and different ways to the table.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.000
So what do you get? You get better decision-making,

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000
and you get less herd behavior,

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.000
and both of those things hit your bottom line

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.000
with very positive results.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000
But one has to wonder,

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.000
now that we've had this financial sector collapse upon us in Iceland --

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000
and by the way, Europe looks pretty bad right now,

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000
and many would say that you in America

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.000
are heading for some more trouble as well.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000
Now that we've had all that happen,

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000
and we have all this data out there

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000
telling us that it's much better to have diversity

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000
around the decision-making tables,

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.000
will we see business and finance change?

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.000
Will government change?

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.000
Well I'll give you my straight talk about this.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000
I have days that I believe,

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.000
but I have days that I'm full of doubt.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.000
Have you seen the incredible urge out there

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.000
to rebuild the very things that failed us?

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.000
(Applause)

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.000
Einstein said

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.000
that this was the definition of insanity --

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.000
to do the same things

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.000
over and over again,

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.000
hoping for a different outcome.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.000
So I guess the world is insane,

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000
because I see entirely too much

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.000
of doing the same things over and over again,

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.000
hoping that this time it's not going to collapse upon us.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.000
I want to see more revolutionary thinking,

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000
and I remain hopeful.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.000
Like TED, I believe in people.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.000
And I know that consumers

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.000
are becoming more conscious,

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:40.000
and they are going to start voting with their wallets,

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000
and they are going to change the face

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000
of business and finance from the outside,

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.000
if they don't do it from the inside.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.000
But I'm more of the revolutionary,

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.000
and I should be; I'm from Iceland.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000
We have a long history

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.000
of strong, courageous, independent women,

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.000
ever since the Viking age.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000
And I want to tell you when

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.000
I first realized that women matter to the economy

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.000
and to the society,

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.000
I was seven -- it happened to be my mother's birthday --

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:10.000
October 24, 1975.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.000
Women in Iceland took the day off.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:16.000
From work or from home, they took the day off,

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.000
and nothing worked in Iceland.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.000
(Laughter)

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.000
They marched into the center of Reykjavik,

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:26.000
and they put women's issues onto the agenda.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.000
And some say this was the start of a global movement.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:32.000
For me it was the start of a long journey,

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.000
but I decided that day to matter.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.000
Five years later,

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:40.000
Iceland elected Vigdis Finnbogadottir as their president --

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.000
first female to become head of state,

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.000
single mom,

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.000
a breast cancer survivor

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.000
who had had one of her breasts removed.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.000
And at one of the campaign sessions,

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:54.000
she had one of her male contenders

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.000
allude to the fact that she couldn't become president --

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:59.000
she was a woman, and even half a woman.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000
That night she won the election,

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000
because she came back --

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:07.000
not just because of his crappy behavior --

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:10.000
but she came back and said,

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:13.000
"Well, I'm actually not going to breastfeed the Icelandic nation;

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.000
I'm going to lead it."

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:19.000
(Applause)

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:22.000
So I've had incredibly many

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.000
women role models

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000
that have influenced who I am and where I am today.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000
But in spite of that,

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.000
I went through the first 10 or 15 years of my career

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.000
mostly in denial of being a woman.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.000
Started in corporate America,

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.000
and I was absolutely convinced

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.000
that it was just about the individual,

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.000
that women and men would have just the same opportunities.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.000
But I've come to conclude lately

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000
that it isn't like that.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.000
We are not the same,

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000
and it's great. Because of our differences,

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.000
we create and sustain life.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:55.000
So we should embrace our difference and aim for challenge.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.000
The final thought I want to leave with you

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.000
is that I'm fed up with this tyranny

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.000
of either/or choices in life --

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:04.000
either it's men or it's women.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:07.000
We need to start embracing the beauty of balance.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.000
So let's move away

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.000
from thinking about business here and philanthropy there,

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.000
and let's start thinking about

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.000
doing good business.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:19.000
That's how we change the world. That's the only sustainable future.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.000
Thank you.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:24.000
(Applause)
