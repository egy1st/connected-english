00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
I grew up in New York City,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
between Harlem and the Bronx.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Growing up as a boy, we were taught

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
that men had to be tough, had to be strong,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
had to be courageous, dominating --

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
no pain, no emotions,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
with the exception of anger --

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
and definitely no fear;

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
that men are in charge,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
which means women are not;

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
that men lead,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
and you should just follow and do what we say;

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
that men are superior; women are inferior;

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
that men are strong; women are weak;

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
that women are of less value,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
property of men,

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
and objects,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
particularly sexual objects.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
I've later come to know that to be

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
the collective socialization of men,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
better known

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
as the "man box."

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
See this man box has in it

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
all the ingredients

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
of how we define what it means to be a man.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
Now I also want to say, without a doubt,

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
there are some wonderful, wonderful,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
absolutely wonderful things

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
about being a man.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
But at the same time,

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
there's some stuff

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
that's just straight up twisted,

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
and we really need to begin

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
to challenge, look at it

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
and really get in the process

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
of deconstructing, redefining,

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
what we come to know as manhood.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
This is my two at home, Kendall and Jay.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
They're 11 and 12.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
Kendall's 15 months older than Jay.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000
There was a period of time when my wife -- her name is Tammie -- and I,

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
we just got real busy and whip, bam, boom:

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
Kendall and Jay.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
(Laughter)

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
And when they were about five and six,

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
four and five,

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
Jay could come to me,

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
come to me crying.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
It didn't matter what she was crying about,

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
she could get on my knee, she could snot my sleeve up,

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
just cry, cry it out.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
Daddy's got you. That's all that's important.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
Now Kendall on the other hand --

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
and like I said, he's only 15 months older than her --

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
he'd come to me crying,

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
it's like as soon as I would hear him cry,

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
a clock would go off.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
I would give the boy probably about 30 seconds,

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
which means, by the time he got to me,

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
I was already saying things like, "Why are you crying?

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000
Hold your head up. Look at me.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
Explain to me what's wrong.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
Tell me what's wrong. I can't understand you.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
Why are you crying?"

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
And out of my own frustration

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
of my role and responsibility

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
of building him up as a man

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
to fit into these guidelines

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000
and these structures that are defining this man box,

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
I would find myself saying things like,

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
"Just go in your room.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
Just go on, go on in your room.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
Sit down,

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
get yourself together

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
and come back and talk to me

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
when you can talk to me like a --" what?

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
(Audience: Man.)

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
Like a man.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
And he's five years old.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
And as I grow in life,

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
I would say to myself,

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000
"My God, what's wrong with me?

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000
What am I doing? Why would I do this?"

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
And I think back.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000
I think back to my father.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000
There was a time in my life

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000
where we had a very troubled experience in our family.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000
My brother, Henry, he died tragically

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000
when we were teenagers.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000
We lived in New York City, as I said.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.000
We lived in the Bronx at the time,

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.000
and the burial was in a place called Long Island,

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.000
it was about two hours outside of the city.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000
And as we were preparing

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000
to come back from the burial,

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000
the cars stopped at the bathroom

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000
to let folks take care of themselves

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000
before the long ride back to the city.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000
And the limousine empties out.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000
My mother, my sister, my auntie, they all get out,

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000
but my father and I stayed in the limousine,

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.000
and no sooner than the women got out,

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000
he burst out crying.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000
He didn't want cry in front of me,

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.000
but he knew he wasn't going to make it back to the city,

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
and it was better me than to allow himself

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.000
to express these feelings and emotions in front of the women.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000
And this is a man

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000
who, 10 minutes ago,

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000
had just put his teenage son

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000
in the ground --

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000
something I just can't even imagine.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000
The thing that sticks with me the most

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.000
is that he was apologizing to me

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000
for crying in front of me,

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000
and at the same time, he was also giving me props,

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000
lifting me up,

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000
for not crying.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.000
I come to also look at this

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000
as this fear that we have as men,

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000
this fear that just has us paralyzed,

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000
holding us hostage

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000
to this man box.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000
I can remember speaking

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000
to a 12-year-old boy, a football player,

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000
and I asked him, I said,

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000
"How would you feel if,

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
in front of all the players,

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.000
your coach told you you were playing like a girl?"

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000
Now I expected him to say something like,

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000
I'd be sad; I'd be mad; I'd be angry, or something like that.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000
No, the boy said to me --

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000
the boy said to me,

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000
"It would destroy me."

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000
And I said to myself,

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000
"God, if it would destroy him

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000
to be called a girl,

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.000
what are we then teaching him

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.000
about girls?"

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:23.000
(Applause)

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000
It took me back to a time

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.000
when I was about 12 years old.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.000
I grew up in tenement buildings in the inner city.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.000
At this time we're living in the Bronx,

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.000
and in the building next to where I lived there was a guy named Johnny.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.000
He was about 16 years old,

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000
and we were all about 12 years old -- younger guys.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000
And he was hanging out with all us younger guys.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.000
And this guy, he was up to a lot of no good.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000
He was the kind of kid who parents would have to wonder,

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.000
"What is this 16-year-old boy doing with these 12-year-old boys?"

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000
And he did spend a lot of time up to no good.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000
He was a troubled kid.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.000
His mother had died from a heroin overdose.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000
He was being raised by his grandmother.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.000
His father wasn't on the set.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000
His grandmother had two jobs.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.000
He was home alone a lot.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000
But I've got to tell you, we young guys,

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000
we looked up to this dude, man.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.000
He was cool. He was fine.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.000
That's what the sisters said, "He was fine."

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000
He was having sex.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000
We all looked up to him.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.000
So one day, I'm out in front of the house doing something --

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.000
just playing around, doing something -- I don't know what.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000
He looks out his window; he calls me upstairs; he said, "Hey Anthony."

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000
They called me Anthony growing up as a kid.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000
"Hey Anthony, come on upstairs."

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000
Johnny call, you go.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000
So I run right upstairs.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.000
As he opens the door, he says to me, "Do you want some?"

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.000
Now I immediately knew what he meant.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000
Because for me growing up at that time,

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.000
and our relationship with this man box,

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.000
"Do you want some?" meant one of two things:

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.000
sex or drugs --

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000
and we weren't doing drugs.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000
Now my box, my card,

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000
my man box card,

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000
was immediately in jeopardy.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.000
Two things: One, I never had sex.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.000
We don't talk about that as men.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:01.000
You only tell your dearest, closest friend, sworn to secrecy for life,

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.000
the first time you had sex.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.000
For everybody else, we go around like we've been having sex since we were two.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.000
There ain't no first time.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:11.000
(Laughter)

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.000
The other thing I couldn't tell him is that I didn't want any.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:16.000
That's even worse. We're supposed to always be on the prowl.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.000
Women are objects,

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.000
especially sexual objects.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.000
Anyway, so I couldn't tell him any of that.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.000
So, like my mother would say, make a long story short,

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.000
I just simply said to Johnny, "Yes."

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.000
He told me to go in his room.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:31.000
I go in his room. On his bed is a girl from the neighborhood named Sheila.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.000
She's 16 years old.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.000
She's nude.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.000
She's what I know today to be mentally ill,

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:40.000
higher-functioning at times than others.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.000
We had a whole choice of inappropriate names for her.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:47.000
Anyway, Johnny had just gotten through having sex with her.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:50.000
Well actually, he raped her, but he would say he had sex with her.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:53.000
Because, while Sheila never said no,

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.000
she also never said yes.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.000
So he was offering me the opportunity to do the same.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:00.000
So when I go in the room, I close the door.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000
Folks, I'm petrified.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000
I stand with my back to the door so Johnny can't bust in the room

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.000
and see that I'm not doing anything,

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:09.000
and I stand there long enough that I could have actually done something.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.000
So now I'm no longer trying to figure out what I'm going to do;

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:14.000
I'm trying to figure out how I'm going to get out of this room.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.000
So in my 12 years of wisdom,

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.000
I zip my pants down,

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.000
I walk out into the room,

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.000
and lo and behold to me,

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.000
while I was in the room with Sheila,

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.000
Johnny was back at the window calling guys up.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.000
So now there's a living room full of guys.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:32.000
It was like the waiting room in the doctor's office.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.000
And they asked me how was it,

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:37.000
and I say to them, "It was good,"

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.000
and I zip my pants up in front of them,

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.000
and I head for the door.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.000
Now I say this all with remorse,

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.000
and I was feeling a tremendous amount of remorse at that time,

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:48.000
but I was conflicted, because, while I was feeling remorse, I was excited,

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000
because I didn't get caught.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.000
But I knew I felt bad about what was happening.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:55.000
This fear, getting outside the man box,

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.000
totally enveloped me.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.000
It was way more important to me,

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:02.000
about me and my man box card

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000
than about Sheila

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.000
and what was happening to her.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.000
See collectively, we as men

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.000
are taught to have less value in women,

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:13.000
to view them as property and the objects of men.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:16.000
We see that as an equation that equals violence against women.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.000
We as men, good men,

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.000
the large majority of men,

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.000
we operate on the foundation

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.000
of this whole collective socialization.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:27.000
We kind of see ourselves separate, but we're very much a part of it.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:30.000
You see, we have to come to understand

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:33.000
that less value, property and objectification is the foundation

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.000
and the violence can't happen without it.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:38.000
So we're very much a part of the solution

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.000
as well as the problem.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.000
The center for disease control says

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.000
that men's violence against women is at epidemic proportions,

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.000
is the number one health concern for women

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.000
in this country and abroad.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:52.000
So quickly, I'd like to just say,

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:55.000
this is the love of my life, my daughter Jay.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.000
The world I envision for her --

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.000
how do I want men to be acting and behaving?

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.000
I need you on board. I need you with me.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:04.000
I need you working with me and me working with you

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.000
on how we raise our sons

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.000
and teach them to be men --

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.000
that it's okay to not be dominating,

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:13.000
that it's okay to have feelings and emotions,

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.000
that it's okay to promote equality,

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:18.000
that it's okay to have women who are just friends and that's it,

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.000
that it's okay to be whole,

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:23.000
that my liberation as a man

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:26.000
is tied to your liberation as a woman. (Applause)

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:29.000
I remember asking a nine-year-old boy,

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:32.000
I asked a nine-year-old boy,

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.000
"What would life be like for you,

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.000
if you didn't have to adhere to this man box?"

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.000
He said to me, "I would be free."

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.000
Thank you folks.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:52.000
(Applause)
