00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
We are now going through an amazing and unprecedented moment

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
where the power dynamics between men and women

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
are shifting very rapidly,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
and in many of the places where it counts the most,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
women are, in fact, taking control of everything.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
In my mother's day, she didn't go to college.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Not a lot of women did.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
And now, for every two men who get a college degree,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
three women will do the same.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Women, for the first time this year,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
became the majority of the American workforce.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
And they're starting to dominate lots of professions --

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
doctors, lawyers,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
bankers, accountants.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Over 50 percent of managers are women these days,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
and in the 15 professions

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
projected to grow the most in the next decade,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
all but two of them are dominated by women.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
So the global economy is becoming a place

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
where women are more successful than men,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
believe it or not,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
and these economic changes

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
are starting to rapidly affect our culture --

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
what our romantic comedies look like,

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
what our marriages look like,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
what our dating lives look like,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
and our new set of superheroes.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
For a long time, this is the image of American manhood that dominated --

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
tough, rugged,

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
in control of his own environment.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
A few years ago, the Marlboro Man was retired

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
and replaced by this

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
much less impressive specimen,

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
who is a parody of American manhood,

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
and that's what we have in our commercials today.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
The phrase "first-born son"

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
is so deeply ingrained in our consciousness

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
that this statistic alone shocked me.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
In American fertility clinics,

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
75 percent of couples

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
are requesting girls and not boys.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
And in places where you wouldn't think,

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
such as South Korea, India and China,

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
the very strict patriarchal societies

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
are starting to break down a little,

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
and families are no longer

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
strongly preferring first-born sons.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
If you think about this, if you just open your eyes to this possibility

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
and start to connect the dots,

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
you can see the evidence everywhere.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
You can see it in college graduation patterns,

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
in job projections,

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
in our marriage statistics,

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
you can see it in the Icelandic elections, which you'll hear about later,

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
and you can see it on South Korean surveys on son preference,

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
that something amazing and unprecedented

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
is happening with women.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000
Certainly this is not the first time that we've had great progress with women.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000
The '20s and the '60s also come to mind.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
But the difference is that, back then,

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000
it was driven by a very passionate feminist movement

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
that was trying to project its own desires,

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
whereas this time, it's not about passion,

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
and it's not about any kind of movement.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
This is really just about the facts

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
of this economic moment that we live in.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
The 200,000-year period

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
in which men have been top dog

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
is truly coming to an end, believe it or not,

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
and that's why I talk about the "end of men."

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
Now all you men out there,

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000
this is not the moment where you tune out or throw some tomatoes,

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
because the point is that this

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
is happening to all of us.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
I myself have a husband and a father

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
and two sons whom I dearly love.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
And this is why I like to talk about this,

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
because if we don't acknowledge it,

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
then the transition will be pretty painful.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
But if we do take account of it,

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000
then I think it will go much more smoothly.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000
I first started thinking about this about a year and a half ago.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000
I was reading headlines about the recession just like anyone else,

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000
and I started to notice a distinct pattern --

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000
that the recession was affecting men

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
much more deeply than it was affecting women.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
And I remembered back to about 10 years ago

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000
when I read a book by Susan Faludi

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.000
called "Stiffed: The Betrayal of the American Man,"

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.000
in which she described how hard the recession had hit men,

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
and I started to think about

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000
whether it had gotten worse this time around in this recession.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000
And I realized that two things were different this time around.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000
The first was that

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000
these were no longer just temporary hits

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000
that the recession was giving men --

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000
that this was reflecting a deeper

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000
underlying shift in our global economy.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000
And second, that the story was no longer

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000
just about the crisis of men,

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000
but it was also about what was happening to women.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000
And now look at this second set of slides.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
These are headlines about what's been going on with women in the next few years.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
These are things we never could have imagined a few years ago.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
Women, a majority of the workplace.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.000
And labor statistics: women take up most managerial jobs.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000
This second set of headlines --

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.000
you can see that families and marriages are starting to shift.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000
And look at that last headline --

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000
young women earning more than young men.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.000
That particular headline comes to me from a market research firm.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.000
They were basically asked by one of their clients

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.000
who was going to buy houses in that neighborhood in the future.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.000
And they expected that it would be young families,

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000
or young men, just like it had always been.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000
But in fact, they found something very surprising.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000
It was young, single women

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.000
who were the major purchasers of houses in the neighborhood.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.000
And so they decided, because they were intrigued by this finding,

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000
to do a nationwide survey.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000
So they spread out all the census data,

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.000
and what they found, the guy described to me as a shocker,

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.000
which is that in 1,997

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000
out of 2,000 communities,

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000
women, young women,

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000
were making more money than young men.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000
So here you have a generation of young women

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000
who grow up thinking of themselves

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000
as being more powerful earners

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000
than the young men around them.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.000
Now, I've just laid out the picture for you,

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.000
but I still haven't explained to you why this is happening.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000
And in a moment, I'm going to show you a graph,

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000
and what you'll see on this graph --

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000
it begins in 1973,

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000
just before women start flooding the workforce,

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000
and it brings us up to our current day.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000
And basically what you'll see

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000
is what economists talk about

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000
as the polarization of the economy.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000
Now what does that mean?

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.000
It means that the economy is dividing into high-skill, high-wage jobs

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000
and low-skill, low-wage jobs --

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.000
and that the middle, the middle-skill jobs,

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.000
and the middle-earning jobs, are starting to drop out of the economy.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000
This has been going on for 40 years now.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000
But this process is affecting men

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000
very differently than it's affecting women.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.000
You'll see the women in red, and you'll see the men in blue.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.000
You'll watch them both drop out of the middle class,

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000
but see what happens to women and see what happens to men.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.000
There we go.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.000
So watch that. You see them both drop out of the middle class.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.000
Watch what happens to the women. Watch what happens to the men.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.000
The men sort of stagnate there,

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000
while the women zoom up in those high-skill jobs.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000
So what's that about?

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.000
It looks like women got some power boost on a video game,

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.000
or like they snuck in some secret serum into their birth-control pills

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000
that lets them shoot up high.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000
But of course, it's not about that.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.000
What it's about is that the economy has changed a lot.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000
We used to have a manufacturing economy,

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000
which was about building goods and products,

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.000
and now we have a service economy

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000
and an information and creative economy.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.000
Those two economies require very different skills,

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000
and as it happens, women have been much better

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.000
at acquiring the new set of skills than men have been.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000
It used to be that you were

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.000
a guy who went to high school

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.000
who didn't have a college degree,

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.000
but you had a specific set of skills,

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000
and with the help of a union,

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000
you could make yourself a pretty good middle-class life.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000
But that really isn't true anymore.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000
This new economy is pretty indifferent

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000
to size and strength,

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.000
which is what's helped men along all these years.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.000
What the economy requires now

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000
is a whole different set of skills.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.000
You basically need intelligence,

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.000
you need an ability to sit still and focus,

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.000
to communicate openly,

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.000
to be able to listen to people

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.000
and to operate in a workplace that is much more fluid than it used to be,

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000
and those are things that women do extremely well,

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.000
as we're seeing.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.000
If you look at management theory these days,

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.000
it used to be that our ideal leader

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.000
sounded something like General Patton, right?

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.000
You would be issuing orders from above.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.000
You would be very hierarchical.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000
You would tell everyone below you what to do.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000
But that's not what an ideal leader is like now.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.000
If you read management books now,

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:36.000
a leader is somebody who can foster creativity,

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.000
who can get his -- get the employees -- see, I still say "his" --

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.000
who can get the employees to talk to each other,

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:44.000
who can basically build teams and get them to be creative.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:47.000
And those are all things that women do very well.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:50.000
And then on top of that, that's created a kind of cascading effect.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000
Women enter the workplace at the top,

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000
and then at the working class,

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.000
all the new jobs that are created

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:59.000
are the kinds of jobs that wives used to do for free at home.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.000
So that's childcare,

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.000
elder care and food preparation.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.000
So those are all the jobs that are growing,

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.000
and those are jobs that women tend to do.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.000
Now one day it might be

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:12.000
that mothers will hire an out-of-work,

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.000
middle-aged, former steelworker guy

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.000
to watch their children at home,

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:19.000
and that would be good for the men, but that hasn't quite happened yet.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:22.000
To see what's going to happen, you can't just look at the workforce that is now,

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:25.000
you have to look at our future workforce.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:28.000
And here the story is fairly simple.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.000
Women are getting college degrees

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000
at a faster rate than men.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.000
Why? This is a real mystery.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:37.000
People have asked men, why don't they just go back to college,

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.000
to community college, say, and retool themselves,

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.000
learn a new set of skills?

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:44.000
Well it turns out that they're just very uncomfortable doing that.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000
They're used to thinking of themselves as providers,

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.000
and they can't seem to build the social networks

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000
that allow them to get through college.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.000
So for some reason

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.000
men just don't end up going back to college.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.000
And what's even more disturbing

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.000
is what's happening with younger boys.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.000
There's been about a decade of research

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000
about what people are calling the "boy crisis."

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000
Now the boy crisis is this idea

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:07.000
that very young boys, for whatever reason,

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:10.000
are doing worse in school than very young girls,

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.000
and people have theories about that.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.000
Is it because we have an excessively verbal curriculum,

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.000
and little girls are better at that than little boys?

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:19.000
Or that we require kids to sit still too much,

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.000
and so boys initially feel like failures?

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.000
And some people say it's because,

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.000
in 9th grade, boys start dropping out of school.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:28.000
Because I'm writing a book about all this, I'm still looking into it,

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.000
so I don't have the answer.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:33.000
But in the mean time, I'm going to call on the worldwide education expert,

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.000
who's my 10-year-old daughter, Noa,

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.000
to talk to you about

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:40.000
why the boys in her class do worse.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.000
(Video) Noa: The girls are obviously smarter.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.000
I mean they have much larger vocabulary.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.000
They learn much faster.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.000
They are more controlled.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:52.000
On the board today for losing recess tomorrow, only boys.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.000
Hanna Rosin: And why is that?

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.000
Noa: Why? They were just not listening to the class

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.000
while the girls sat there very nicely.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.000
HR: So there you go.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.000
This whole thesis really came home to me

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:05.000
when I went to visit a college in Kansas City --

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.000
working-class college.

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:10.000
Certainly, when I was in college, I had certain expectations about my life --

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:13.000
that my husband and I would both work,

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.000
and that we would equally raise the children.

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:17.000
But these college girls

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.000
had a completely different view of their future.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:22.000
Basically, the way they said it to me is

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.000
that they would be working 18 hours a day,

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.000
that their husband would maybe have a job,

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:29.000
but that mostly he would be at home taking care of the kiddies.

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.000
And this was kind of a shocker to me.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:33.000
And then here's my favorite quote from one of the girls:

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:36.000
"Men are the new ball and chain."

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:39.000
(Laughter)

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.000
Now you laugh,

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.000
but that quote has kind of a sting to it, right?

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.000
And I think the reason it has a sting

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.000
is because thousands of years of history

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.000
don't reverse themselves

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.000
without a lot of pain,

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:53.000
and that's why I talk about

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.000
us all going through this together.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.000
The night after I talked to these college girls,

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.000
I also went to a men's group in Kansas,

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:03.000
and these were exactly the kind of victims of the manufacturing economy

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:05.000
which I spoke to you about earlier.

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:07.000
They were men who had been contractors,

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.000
or they had been building houses

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.000
and they had lost their jobs after the housing boom,

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:14.000
and they were in this group because they were failing to pay their child support.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.000
And the instructor was up there in the class

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.000
explaining to them all the ways

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:21.000
in which they had lost their identity in this new age.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:24.000
He was telling them they no longer had any moral authority,

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.000
that nobody needed them for emotional support anymore,

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.000
and they were not really the providers.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.000
So who were they?

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.000
And this was very disheartening for them.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.000
And what he did was he wrote down on the board

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.000
"$85,000,"

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.000
and he said, "That's her salary,"

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:41.000
and then he wrote down "$12,000."

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:43.000
"That's your salary.

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.000
So who's the man now?" he asked them.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:47.000
"Who's the damn man?

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.000
She's the man now."

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.000
And that really sent a shudder through the room.

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.000
And that's part of the reason I like to talk about this,

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.000
because I think it can be pretty painful,

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:57.000
and we really have to work through it.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.000
And the other reason it's kind of urgent

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.000
is because it's not just happening in the U.S.

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.000
It's happening all over the world.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:05.000
In India, poor women are learning English

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:07.000
faster than their male counterparts

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:09.000
in order to staff the new call centers

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:11.000
that are growing in India.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:14.000
In China, a lot of the opening up of private entrepreneurship

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.000
is happening because women are starting businesses,

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.000
small businesses, faster than men.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:21.000
And here's my favorite example, which is in South Korea.

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:23.000
Over several decades,

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:26.000
South Korea built one of the most patriarchal societies we know about.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:30.000
They basically enshrined the second-class status of women

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.000
in the civil code.

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.000
And if women failed to birth male children,

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:37.000
they were basically treated like domestic servants.

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:40.000
And sometimes family would pray to the spirits to kill off a girl child

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:42.000
so they could have a male child.

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:44.000
But over the '70s and '80s,

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:47.000
the South Korea government decided they wanted to rapidly industrialize,

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:49.000
and so what they did was,

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:51.000
they started to push women into the workforce.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:54.000
Now they've been asking a question since 1985:

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.000
"How strongly do you prefer a first-born son?"

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.000
And now look at the chart.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:01.000
That's from 1985 to 2003.

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:03.000
How much do you prefer a first-born son?

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:05.000
So you can see that these economic changes

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:08.000
really do have a strong effect on our culture.

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:11.000
Now because we haven't fully processed this information,

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:13.000
it's kind of coming back to us in our pop culture

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:16.000
in these kind of weird and exaggerated ways,

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:19.000
where you can see that the stereotypes are changing.

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:21.000
And so we have on the male side

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:24.000
what one of my colleagues likes to call the "omega males" popping up,

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.000
who are the males who are romantically challenged losers

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:28.000
who can't find a job.

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:31.000
And they come up in lots of different forms.

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:34.000
So we have the perpetual adolescent.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:37.000
We have the charmless misanthrope.

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:39.000
Then we have our Bud Light guy

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:41.000
who's the happy couch potato.

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:44.000
And then here's a shocker: even America's most sexiest man alive,

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:46.000
the sexiest man alive

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.000
gets romantically played these days in a movie.

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:51.000
And then on the female side, you have the opposite,

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:54.000
in which you have these crazy superhero women.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:57.000
You've got Lady Gaga.

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:00.000
You've got our new James Bond, who's Angelina Jolie.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:03.000
And it's not just for the young, right?

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:06.000
Even Helen Mirren can hold a gun these days.

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:09.000
And so it feels like we have to move from this place

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:12.000
where we've got these uber-exaggerated images

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:15.000
into something that feels a little more normal.

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:17.000
So for a long time in the economic sphere,

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:19.000
we've lived with the term "glass ceiling."

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:21.000
Now I've never really liked this term.

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:23.000
For one thing, it puts men and women

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:26.000
in a really antagonistic relationship with one another,

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.000
because the men are these devious tricksters up there

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.000
who've put up this glass ceiling.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:33.000
And we're always below the glass ceiling, the women.

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:36.000
And we have a lot of skill and experience,

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:38.000
but it's a trick, so how are you supposed to prepare

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:40.000
to get through that glass ceiling?

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:43.000
And also, "shattering the glass ceiling" is a terrible phrase.

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:45.000
What crazy person

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:47.000
would pop their head through a glass ceiling?

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:49.000
So the image that I like to think of,

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:51.000
instead of glass ceiling,

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:53.000
is the high bridge.

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:56.000
It's definitely terrifying to stand at the foot of a high bridge,

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:58.000
but it's also pretty exhilarating,

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:00.000
because it's beautiful up there,

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:03.000
and you're looking out on a beautiful view.

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:06.000
And the great thing is there's no trick like with the glass ceiling.

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:08.000
There's no man or woman standing in the middle

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:10.000
about to cut the cables.

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:12.000
There's no hole in the middle that you're going to fall through.

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:15.000
And the great thing is that you can take anyone along with you.

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:17.000
You can bring your husband along.

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:19.000
You can bring your friends, or your colleagues,

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:21.000
or your babysitter to walk along with you.

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:24.000
And husbands can drag their wives across, if their wives don't feel ready.

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:26.000
But the point about the high bridge

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:28.000
is that you have to have the confidence

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:30.000
to know that you deserve to be on that bridge,

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:33.000
that you have all the skills and experience you need

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:36.000
in order to walk across the high bridge,

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:38.000
but you just have to make the decision

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:40.000
