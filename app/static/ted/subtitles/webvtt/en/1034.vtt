00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
I have been teaching for a long time,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
and in doing so

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
have acquired a body of knowledge about kids and learning

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
that I really wish more people would understand

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
about the potential of students.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
In 1931, my grandmother --

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
bottom left for you guys over here --

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
graduated from the eighth grade.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
She went to school to get the information

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
because that's where the information lived.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
It was in the books; it was inside the teacher's head;

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
and she needed to go there to get the information,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
because that's how you learned.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Fast-forward a generation:

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
this is the one-room schoolhouse, Oak Grove,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
where my father went to a one-room schoolhouse.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
And he again had to travel to the school

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
to get the information from the teacher,

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
stored it in the only portable memory he has, which is inside his own head,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
and take it with him,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
because that is how information was being transported

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
from teacher to student and then used in the world.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
When I was a kid,

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
we had a set of encyclopedias at my house.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
It was purchased the year I was born,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
and it was extraordinary,

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
because I did not have to wait to go to the library to get to the information.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
The information was inside my house

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
and it was awesome.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
This was different

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
than either generation had experienced before,

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
and it changed the way I interacted with information

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
even at just a small level.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
But the information was closer to me.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
I could get access to it.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
In the time that passes

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
between when I was a kid in high school

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
and when I started teaching,

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
we really see the advent of the Internet.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
Right about the time that the Internet gets going

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
as an educational tool,

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
I take off from Wisconsin

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
and move to Kansas, small town Kansas,

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
where I had an opportunity to teach

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
in a lovely, small-town,

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
rural Kansas school district,

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
where I was teaching my favorite subject,

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
American government.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
My first year -- super gung-ho -- going to teach American government,

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
loved the political system.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
Kids in the 12th grade:

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
not exactly all that enthusiastic

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
about the American government system.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000
Year two: learned a few things -- had to change my tactic.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
And I put in front of them an authentic experience

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
that allowed them to learn for themselves.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
I didn't tell them what to do or how to do it.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
I posed a problem in front of them,

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000
which was to put on an election forum for their own community.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
They produced flyers. They called offices.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
They checked schedules. They were meeting with secretaries.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
They produced an election forum booklet

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
for the entire town to learn more about their candidates.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
They invited everyone into the school

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
for an evening of conversation

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
about government and politics

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
and whether or not the streets were done well,

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000
and really had this robust experiential learning.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
The older teachers -- more experienced --

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
looked at me and went,

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000
"Oh, there she is. That's so cute. She's trying to get that done."

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000
(Laughter)

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
"She doesn't know what she's in for."

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
But I knew that the kids would show up,

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
and I believed it,

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000
and I told them every week what I expected out of them.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
And that night, all 90 kids --

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
dressed appropriately, doing their job, owning it.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
I had to just sit and watch.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
It was theirs. It was experiential. It was authentic.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
It meant something to them.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
And they will step up.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000
From Kansas, I moved on to lovely Arizona,

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000
where I taught in Flagstaff for a number of years,

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
this time with middle school students.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000
Luckily, I didn't have to teach them American government.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000
Could teach them the more exciting topic of geography.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000
Again, "thrilled" to learn.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
But what was interesting

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000
about this position I found myself in in Arizona,

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
was I had this really

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
extraordinarily eclectic group of kids to work with

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
in a truly public school,

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000
and we got to have these moments where we would get these opportunities.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000
And one opportunity

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000
was we got to go and meet Paul Rusesabagina,

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000
which is the gentleman

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000
that the movie "Hotel Rwanda" is based after.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000
And he was going to speak at the high school next door to us.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000
We could walk there. We didn't even have to pay for the buses.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.000
There was no expense cost. Perfect field trip.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000
The problem then becomes

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000
how do you take seventh- and eighth-graders to a talk about genocide

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000
and deal with the subject in a way

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000
that is responsible and respectful,

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
and they know what to do with it.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
And so we chose to look at Paul Rusesabagina

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000
as an example of a gentleman

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.000
who singularly used his life to do something positive.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000
I then challenged the kids to identify

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000
someone in their own life, or in their own story, or in their own world,

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000
that they could identify that had done a similar thing.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000
I asked them to produce a little movie about it.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000
It's the first time we'd done this.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000
Nobody really knew how to make these little movies on the computer,

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.000
but they were into it. And I asked them to put their own voice over it.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:29.000
It was the most awesome moment of revelation

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.000
that when you ask kids to use their own voice

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000
and ask them to speak for themselves,

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000
what they're willing to share.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000
The last question of the assignment is:

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000
how do you plan to use your life

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000
to positively impact other people?

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000
The things that kids will say

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.000
when you ask them and take the time to listen

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.000
is extraordinary.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.000
Fast-forward to Pennsylvania, where I find myself today.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000
I teach at the Science Leadership Academy,

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.000
which is a partnership school between the Franklin Institute

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000
and the school district of Philadelphia.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000
We are a nine through 12 public school,

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000
but we do school quite differently.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000
I moved there primarily

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000
to be part of a learning environment

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000
that validated the way that I knew that kids learned,

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000
and that really wanted to investigate

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000
what was possible

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000
when you are willing to let go

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000
of some of the paradigms of the past,

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.000
of information scarcity when my grandmother was in school

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.000
and when my father was in school and even when I was in school,

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000
and to a moment when we have information surplus.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.000
So what do you do when the information is all around you?

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.000
Why do you have kids come to school

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.000
if they no longer have to come there to get the information?

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.000
In Philadelphia we have a one-to-one laptop program,

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.000
so the kids are bringing in laptops with them everyday,

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.000
taking them home, getting access to information.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.000
And here's the thing that you need to get comfortable with

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000
when you've given the tool

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000
to acquire information to students,

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.000
is that you have to be comfortable with this idea

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000
of allowing kids to fail

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.000
as part of the learning process.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000
We deal right now in the educational landscape

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.000
with an infatuation

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000
with the culture of one right answer

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.000
that can be properly bubbled on the average multiple choice test,

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000
and I am here to share with you:

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000
it is not learning.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.000
That is the absolute wrong thing to ask,

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000
to tell kids to never be wrong.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.000
To ask them to always have the right answer

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000
doesn't allow them to learn.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000
So we did this project,

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000
and this is one of the artifacts of the project.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000
I almost never show them off

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000
because of the issue of the idea of failure.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000
My students produced these info-graphics

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.000
as a result of a unit that we decided to do at the end of the year

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.000
responding to the oil spill.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:40.000
I asked them to take the examples that we were seeing

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000
of the info-graphics that existed

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000
in a lot of mass media,

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.000
and take a look at what were the interesting components of it,

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000
and produce one for themselves

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000
of a different man-made disaster from American history.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000
And they had certain criteria to do it.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000
They were a little uncomfortable with it,

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.000
because we'd never done this before, and they didn't know exactly how to do it.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.000
They can talk -- they're very smooth,

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000
and they can write very, very well,

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:04.000
but asking them to communicate ideas in a different way

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:07.000
was a little uncomfortable for them.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:10.000
But I gave them the room to just do the thing.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.000
Go create. Go figure it out.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.000
Let's see what we can do.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.000
And the student that persistently

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:19.000
turns out the best visual product did not disappoint.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.000
This was done in like two or three days.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.000
And this is the work of the student that consistently did it.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.000
And when I sat the students down, I said, "Who's got the best one?"

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000
And they immediately went, "There it is."

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000
Didn't read anything. "There it is."

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.000
And I said, "Well what makes it great?"

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.000
And they're like, "Oh, the design's good, and he's using good color.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.000
And there's some ... " And they went through all that we processed out loud.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.000
And I said, "Go read it."

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.000
And they're like, "Oh, that one wasn't so awesome."

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.000
And then we went to another one --

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.000
it didn't have great visuals, but it had great information --

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:50.000
and spent an hour talking about the learning process,

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000
because it wasn't about whether or not it was perfect,

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000
or whether or not it was what I could create.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.000
It asked them to create for themselves,

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.000
and it allowed them to fail,

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.000
process, learn from.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.000
And when we do another round of this in my class this year,

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.000
they will do better this time,

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.000
because learning

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:10.000
has to include an amount of failure,

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000
because failure is instructional

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.000
in the process.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:17.000
There are a million pictures

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.000
that I could click through here,

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:22.000
and had to choose carefully -- this is one of my favorites --

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.000
of students learning,

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000
of what learning can look like

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:29.000
in a landscape where we let go of the idea

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000
that kids have to come to school to get the information,

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.000
but instead, ask them what they can do with it.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.000
Ask them really interesting questions.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.000
They will not disappoint.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.000
Ask them to go to places,

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.000
to see things for themselves,

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.000
to actually experience the learning,

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:46.000
to play, to inquire.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.000
This is one of my favorite photos,

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000
because this was taken on Tuesday,

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.000
when I asked the students to go to the polls.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:55.000
This is Robbie, and this was his first day of voting,

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.000
and he wanted to share that with everybody and do that.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.000
But this is learning too,

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:02.000
because we asked them to go out into real spaces.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.000
The main point

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:10.000
is that, if we continue to look at education

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:13.000
as if it's about coming to school

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.000
to get the information

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.000
and not about experiential learning,

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:20.000
empowering student voice and embracing failure,

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.000
we're missing the mark.

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.000
And everything that everybody is talking about today

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:27.000
isn't possible if we keep having an educational system

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:30.000
that does not value these qualities,

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.000
because we won't get there with a standardized test,

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.000
and we won't get there with a culture of one right answer.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.000
We know how to do this better,

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.000
and it's time to do better.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:43.000
(Applause)
