00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Alisa Volkman: So this is where our story begins --

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
the dramatic moments of the birth

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
of our first son, Declan.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Obviously a really profound moment,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
and it changed our lives in many ways.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
It also changed our lives in many unexpected ways,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
and those unexpected ways we later reflected on,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
that eventually spawned a business idea between the two of us,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
and a year later, we launched Babble,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
a website for parents.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Rufus Griscom: Now I think of our story

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
as starting a few years earlier. AV: That's true.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
RG: You may remember, we fell head over heels in love.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
AV: We did.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
RG: We were at the time running a very different kind of website.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
It was a website called Nerve.com,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
the tagline of which was "literate smut."

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
It was in theory, and hopefully in practice,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
a smart online magazine

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
about sex and culture.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
AV: That spawned a dating site.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
But you can understand the jokes that we get. Sex begets babies.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
You follow instructions on Nerve and you should end up on Babble,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
which we did.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
And we might launch a geriatric site as our third. We'll see.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
RG: But for us, the continuity between Nerve and Babble

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
was not just the life stage thing,

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
which is, of course, relevant,

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
but it was really more about

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
our desire to speak very honestly

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
about subjects that people have difficulty speaking honestly about.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
It seems to us that

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
when people start dissembling, people start lying about things,

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
that's when it gets really interesting.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
That's a subject that we want to dive into.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
And we've been surprised to find, as young parents,

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
that there are almost more taboos around parenting

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
than there are around sex.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
AV: It's true. So like we said,

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
the early years were really wonderful,

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
but they were also really difficult.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
And we feel like some of that difficulty

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
was because of this false advertisement around parenting.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
(Laughter)

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
We subscribed to a lot of magazines, did our homework,

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
but really everywhere you look around, we were surrounded by images like this.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
And we went into parenting

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
expecting our lives to look like this.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
The sun was always streaming in, and our children would never be crying.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
I would always be perfectly coiffed and well rested,

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
and in fact, it was not like that at all.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
RG: When we lowered the glossy parenting magazine

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
that we were looking at, with these beautiful images,

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
and looked at the scene in our actual living room,

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
it looked a little bit more like this.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
These are our three sons.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
And of course, they're not always crying and screaming,

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
but with three boys, there's a decent probability

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
that at least one of them will not be comporting himself

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
exactly as he should.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000
AV: Yes, you can see where the disconnect was happening for us.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000
We really felt like what we went in expecting

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000
had nothing to do with what we were actually experiencing,

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000
and so we decided we really wanted to give it to parents straight.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000
We really wanted to let them understand

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000
what the realities of parenting were in an honest way.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
RG: So today, what we would love to do

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000
is share with you four parenting taboos.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
And of course, there are many more than four things

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000
you can't say about parenting,

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
but we would like to share with you today

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
four that are particularly relevant for us personally.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
So the first, taboo number one:

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
you can't say you didn't fall in love with your baby

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000
in the very first minute.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000
I remember vividly, sitting there in the hospital.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000
We were in the process of giving birth to our first child.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000
AV: We, or I?

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
RG: I'm sorry.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
Misuse of the pronoun.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
Alisa was very generously in the process

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
of giving birth to our first child -- (AV: Thank you.)

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000
-- and I was there with a catcher's mitt.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000
And I was there with my arms open.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
The nurse was coming at me

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000
with this beautiful, beautiful child,

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
and I remember, as she was approaching me,

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.000
the voices of friends saying,

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000
"The moment they put the baby in your hands,

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000
you will feel a sense of love that will come over you

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000
that is [on] an order of magnitude more powerful

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.000
than anything you've ever experienced in your entire life."

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000
So I was bracing myself for the moment.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000
The baby was coming,

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000
and I was ready for this Mack truck of love

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.000
to just knock me off my feet.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.000
And instead, when the baby was placed in my hands,

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000
it was an extraordinary moment.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000
This picture is from literally a few seconds after

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.000
the baby was placed in my hands and I brought him over.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000
And you can see, our eyes were glistening.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000
I was overwhelmed with love and affection for my wife,

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000
with deep, deep gratitude

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000
that we had what appeared to be a healthy child.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000
And it was also, of course, surreal.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000
I mean, I had to check the tags and make sure.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000
I was incredulous, "Are you sure this is our child?"

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.000
And this was all quite remarkable.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.000
But what I felt towards the child at that moment was deep affection,

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.000
but nothing like what I feel for him now, five years later.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
And so we've done something here

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
that is heretical.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.000
We have charted

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.000
our love for our child over time.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000
(Laughter)

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.000
This, as you know, is an act of heresy.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000
You're not allowed to chart love.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000
The reason you're not allowed to chart love

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000
is because we think of love as a binary thing.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000
You're either in love, or you're not in love.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000
You love, or you don't love.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.000
And I think the reality is that love is a process,

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000
and I think the problem with thinking of love

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000
as something that's binary

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000
is that it causes us

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000
to be unduly concerned

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.000
that love is fraudulent, or inadequate, or what have you.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.000
And I think I'm speaking obviously here to the father's experience.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000
But I think a lot of men do go through this sense

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.000
in the early months, maybe their first year,

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000
that their emotional response is inadequate in some fashion.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000
AV: Well, I'm glad Rufus is bringing this up,

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.000
because you can notice where he dips in the first years

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.000
where I think I was doing most of the work.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000
But we like to joke,

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000
in the first few months of all of our children's lives,

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000
this is Uncle Rufus.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.000
(Laughter)

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000
RG: I'm a very affectionate uncle, very affectionate uncle.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.000
AV: Yes, and I often joke with Rufus when he comes home

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.000
that I'm not sure he would actually be able to find our child in a line-up

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.000
amongst other babies.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000
So I actually threw a pop quiz here onto Rufus.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.000
RG: Uh oh.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.000
AV: I don't want to embarrass him too much. But I am going to give him three seconds.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.000
RG: That is not fair. This is a trick question. He's not up there, is he?

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.000
AV: Our eight-week-old son is somewhere in here,

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.000
and I want to see if Rufus can actually quickly identify him.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000
RG: The far left. AV: No!

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:08.000
(Laughter)

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000
RG: Cruel.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000
AV: Nothing more to be said.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000
(Laughter)

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.000
I'll move on to taboo number two.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.000
You can't talk about how lonely having a baby can be.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.000
I enjoyed being pregnant. I loved it.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.000
I felt incredibly connected to the community around me.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.000
I felt like everyone was participating in my pregnancy, all around me,

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.000
tracking it down till the actual due-date.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:34.000
I felt like I was a vessel of the future of humanity.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.000
That continued into the the hospital. It was really exhilarating.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:40.000
I was shower with gifts and flowers and visitors.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:43.000
It was a really wonderful experience,

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.000
but when I got home,

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000
I suddenly felt very disconnected

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.000
and suddenly shut in and shut out,

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.000
and I was really surprised by those feelings.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000
I did expect it to be difficult,

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000
have sleepless nights, constant feedings,

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.000
but I did not expect the feelings

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:01.000
of isolation and loneliness that I experienced,

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.000
and I was really surprised that no one had talked to me,

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.000
that I was going to be feeling this way.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.000
And I called my sister

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:10.000
whom I'm very close to -- and had three children --

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.000
and I asked her, "Why didn't you tell me

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.000
I was going to be feeling this way,

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.000
that I was going to have these -- feeling incredibly isolated?"

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.000
And she said -- I'll never forget --

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.000
"It's just not something you want to say to a mother

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:25.000
that's having a baby for the first time."

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.000
RG: And of course, we think

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.000
it's precisely what you really should be saying

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.000
to mothers who have kids for the first time.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:36.000
And that this, of course, one of the themes for us

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.000
is that we think

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.000
that candor and brutal honesty

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.000
is critical to us collectively

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.000
being great parents.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.000
And it's hard not to think

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.000
that part of what leads to this sense of isolation

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.000
is our modern world.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000
So Alisa's experience is not isolated.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000
So your 58 percent of mothers surveyed

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.000
report feelings of loneliness.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.000
Of those, 67 percent are most lonely

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:01.000
when their kids are zero to five -- probably really zero to two.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.000
In the process of preparing this,

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.000
we looked at how some other cultures around the world

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:08.000
deal with this period of time,

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.000
because here in the Western world,

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:13.000
less than 50 percent of us live near our family members,

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:16.000
which I think is part of why this is such a tough period.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.000
So to take one example among many:

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.000
in Southern India

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.000
there's a practice known as jholabhari,

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:25.000
in which the pregnant woman, when she's seven or eight months pregnant,

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.000
moves in with her mother

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.000
and goes through a series of rituals and ceremonies,

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:32.000
give birth and returns home to her nuclear family

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.000
several months after the child is born.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.000
And this is one of many ways

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.000
that we think other cultures offset this kind of lonely period.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.000
AV: So taboo number three:

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:44.000
you can't talk about your miscarriage -- but today I'll talk about mine.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000
So after we had Declan,

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.000
we kind of recalibrated our expectations.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.000
We thought we actually could go through this again

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:54.000
and thought we knew what we would be up against.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:57.000
And we were grateful that I was able to get pregnant,

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.000
and I soon learned that we were having a boy,

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.000
and then when I was five months,

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.000
we learned that we had lost our child.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:06.000
This is actually the last little image we have of him.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.000
And it was obviously a very difficult time --

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.000
really painful.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.000
As I was working through that mourning process,

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:18.000
I was amazed that I didn't want to see anybody.

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:21.000
I really wanted to crawl into a hole,

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.000
and I didn't really know how I was going

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:26.000
to work my way back into my surrounding community.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:29.000
And I realize, I think, the way I was feeling that way,

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.000
is on a really deep gut level,

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:34.000
I was feeling a lot of shame

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.000
and embarrassed, frankly,

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.000
that, in some respects, I had failed

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:41.000
at delivering what I'm genetically engineered to do.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.000
And of course, it made me question,

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.000
if I wasn't able to have another child,

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.000
what would that mean for my marriage,

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.000
and just me as a woman.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.000
So it was a very difficult time.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.000
As I started working through it more,

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:56.000
I started climbing out of that hole and talking with other people.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.000
I was really amazed

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.000
by all the stories that started flooding in.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.000
People I interacted with daily,

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.000
worked with, was friends with,

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.000
family members that I had known a long time,

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.000
had never shared with me their own stories.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:11.000
And I just remember feeling all these stories came out of the woodwork,

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.000
and I felt like I happened upon

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:16.000
this secret society of women that I now was a part of,

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:19.000
which was reassuring and also really concerning.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.000
And I think,

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.000
miscarriage is an invisible loss.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.000
There's not really a lot of community support around it.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.000
There's really no ceremony,

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.000
rituals, or rites.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:33.000
And I think, with a death, you have a funeral, you celebrate the life,

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.000
and there's a lot of community support,

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.000
and it's something women don't have with miscarriage.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.000
RG: Which is too bad because, of course,

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.000
it's a very common and very traumatic experience.

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:44.000
Fifteen to 20 percent of all pregnancies result in miscarriage,

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.000
and I find this astounding.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.000
In a survey, 74 percent of women said

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:51.000
that miscarriage, they felt, was partly their fault, which is awful.

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:53.000
And astoundingly, 22 percent

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.000
said they would hide a miscarriage from their spouse.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.000
So taboo number four:

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:00.000
you can't say that your average happiness

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:03.000
has declined since having a child.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:06.000
The party line is that every single aspect of my life

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.000
has just gotten dramatically better

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.000
ever since I participated

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:13.000
in the miracle that is childbirth and family.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:17.000
I'll never forget, I remember vividly to this day,

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:20.000
our first son, Declan, was nine months old,

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.000
and I was sitting there on the couch,

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:25.000
and I was reading Daniel Gilbert's wonderful book, "Stumbling on Happiness."

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.000
And I got about two-thirds of the way through,

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:30.000
and there was a chart on the right-hand side --

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.000
on the right-hand page --

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.000
that we've labeled here

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.000
"The Most Terrifying Chart Imaginable

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.000
for a New Parent."

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:41.000
This chart is comprised of four completely independent studies.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:44.000
Basically, there's this precipitous drop

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:46.000
of marital satisfaction,

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:49.000
which is closely aligned, we all know, with broader happiness,

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.000
that doesn't rise again

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:54.000
until your first child goes to college.

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:57.000
So I'm sitting here looking at the next two decades of my life,

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.000
this chasm of happiness

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:02.000
that we're driving our proverbial convertible straight into.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:05.000
We were despondent.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:07.000
AV: So you can imagine, I mean again, the first few months were difficult,

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:09.000
but we'd come out of it,

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:11.000
and were really shocked to see this study.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:14.000
So we really wanted to take a deeper look at it

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.000
in hopes that we would find a silver lining.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.000
RG: And that's when it's great to be running a website for parents,

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:21.000
because we got this incredible reporter

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:24.000
to go and interview all the scientists

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:26.000
who conducted these four studies.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.000
We said, something is wrong here.

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.000
There's something missing from these studies.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:33.000
It can't possibly be that bad.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:37.000
So Liz Mitchell did a wonderful job with this piece,

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:40.000
and she interviewed four scientists,

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:42.000
and she also interviewed Daniel Gilbert,

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:44.000
and we did indeed find a silver lining.

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:46.000
So this is our guess

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:49.000
as to what this baseline of average happiness

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:51.000
arguably looks like throughout life.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.000
Average happiness is, of course, inadequate,

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.000
because it doesn't speak

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.000
to the moment-by-moment experience,

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:00.000
and so this is what we think it looks like

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.000
when you layer in

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:05.000
moment-to-moment experience.

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:07.000
And so we all remember as children,

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:10.000
the tiniest little thing -- and we see it on the faces of our children --

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.000
the teeniest little thing

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.000
can just rocket them to these heights

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.000
of just utter adulation,

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.000
and then the next teeniest little thing

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:20.000
can cause them just to plummet to the depths of despair.

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:23.000
And it's just extraordinary to watch, and we remember it ourselves.

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:25.000
And then, of course, as you get older,

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:27.000
it's almost like age is a form of lithium.

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:30.000
As you get older, you become more stable.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:33.000
And part of what happens, I think, in your '20s and '30s,

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:35.000
is you start to learn to hedge your happiness.

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:37.000
You start to realize that

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:40.000
"Hey, I could go to this live music event

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:42.000
and have an utterly transforming experience

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:45.000
that will cover my entire body with goosebumps,

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.000
but it's more likely that I'll feel claustrophobic

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:50.000
and I won't be able to get a beer.

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.000
So I'm not going to go.

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:55.000
I've got a good stereo at home. So, I'm not going to go."

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:58.000
So your average happiness goes up,

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:00.000
but you lose those transcendent moments.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:03.000
AV: Yeah, and then you have your first child,

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:05.000
and then you really resubmit yourself

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:07.000
to these highs and lows --

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:10.000
the highs being the first steps, the first smile,

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:12.000
your child reading to you for the first time --

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:15.000
the lows being, our house, any time from six to seven every night.

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:19.000
But you realize you resubmit yourself

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:22.000
to losing control in a really wonderful way,

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:24.000
which we think provides a lot of meaning to our lives

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.000
and is quite gratifying.

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.000
RG: And so in effect,

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.000
we trade average happiness.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.000
We trade the sort of security and safety

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.000
of a certain level of contentment

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:37.000
for these transcendent moments.

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.000
So where does that leave the two of us

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:41.000
as a family with our three little boys

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:43.000
in the thick of all this?

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:45.000
There's another factor in our case.

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:47.000
We have violated yet another taboo

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:49.000
in our own lives,

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:52.000
and this is a bonus taboo.

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:55.000
AV: A quick bonus taboo for you, that we should not be working together,

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:57.000
especially with three children --

00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:59.000
and we are.

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:02.000
RG: And we had reservations about this on the front end.

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:05.000
Everybody knows, you should absolutely not work with your spouse.

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:08.000
In fact, when we first went out to raise money to start Babble,

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:10.000
the venture capitalists said,

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:12.000
"We categorically don't invest

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:14.000
in companies founded by husbands and wives,

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:16.000
because there's an extra point of failure.

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:18.000
It's a bad idea. Don't do it."

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.000
And we obviously went forward. We did.

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:23.000
We raised the money, and we're thrilled that we did,

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:25.000
because in this phase of one's life,

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:28.000
the incredibly scarce resource is time.

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:31.000
And if you're really passionate about what you do every day -- which we are --

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:33.000
and you're also passionate about your relationship,

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:36.000
this is the only way we know how to do it.

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:38.000
And so the final question that we would ask is:

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:41.000
can we collectively bend that happiness chart upwards?

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:44.000
It's great that we have these transcendent moments of joy,

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:47.000
but they're sometimes pretty quick.

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:50.000
And so how about that average baseline of happiness?

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:52.000
Can we move that up a little bit?

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:55.000
AV: And we kind of feel that the happiness gap, which we talked about,

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:57.000
is really the result of walking into parenting --

00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:59.000
and really any long-term partnership for that matter --

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:01.000
with the wrong expectations.

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:04.000
And if you have the right expectations and expectation management,

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:07.000
we feel like it's going to be a pretty gratifying experience.

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:09.000
RG: And so this is what --

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:11.000
And we think that a lot of parents,

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:13.000
when you get in there -- in our case anyway --

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:16.000
you pack your bags for a trip to Europe, and you're really excited to go.

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:18.000
Get out of the airplane,

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:20.000
it turns out you're trekking in Nepal.

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:23.000
And trekking in Nepal is an extraordinary experience,

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:25.000
particularly if you pack your bags properly

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:27.000
and you know what you're getting in for and you're psyched.

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:29.000
So the point of all this for us today

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:32.000
is not just hopefully honesty for the sake of honesty,

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:35.000
but a hope that by being more honest and candid about these experiences,

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:37.000
that we can all collectively

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:40.000
bend that happiness baseline up a little bit.

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:42.000
RG + AV: Thank you.

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:47.000
(Applause)
