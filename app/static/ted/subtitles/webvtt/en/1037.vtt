00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
So today I'm going to talk to you

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
about the rise of collaborative consumption.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
I'm going to explain what it is

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
and try and convince you -- in just 15 minutes --

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
that this isn't a flimsy idea,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
or a short-term trend,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
but a powerful cultural and economic force

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
reinventing not just what we consume,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
but how we consume.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Now I'm going to start with a deceptively simple example.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Hands up -- how many of you

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
have books, CDs, DVDs, or videos

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
lying around your house

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
that you probably won't use again,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
but you can't quite bring yourself to throw away?

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Can't see all the hands,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
but it looks like all of you, right?

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
On our shelves at home,

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
we have a box set of the DVD series "24,"

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
season six to be precise.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
I think it was bought for us around three years ago for a Christmas present.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
Now my husband, Chris, and I

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
love this show.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
But let's face it, when you've watched it once maybe, or twice,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
you don't really want to watch it again,

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
because you know how Jack Bauer is going to defeat the terrorists.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
So there it sits on our shelves

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
obsolete to us,

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
but with immediate latent value to someone else.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
Now before we go on, I have a confession to make.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
I lived in New York for 10 years,

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
and I am a big fan of "Sex and the City."

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
Now I'd love to watch the first movie again

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
as sort of a warm-up to the sequel coming out next week.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
So how easily could I swap

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
our unwanted copy of "24"

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
for a wanted copy of "Sex and the City?"

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
Now you may have noticed

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
there's a new sector emerging called swap-trading.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
Now the easiest analogy for swap-trading

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
is like an online dating service

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
for all your unwanted media.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
What it does is use the Internet

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
to create an infinite marketplace

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
to match person A's "haves"

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
with person C's "wants,"

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
whatever they may be.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
The other week, I went on one of these sites,

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
appropriately called Swaptree,

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
and there were over 59,300 items

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
that I could instantly swap

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
for my copy of "24."

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
Lo and behold,

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
there in Reseda, CA was Rondoron

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
who wanted swap his or her

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
"like new" copy of "Sex and the City"

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000
for my copy of "24."

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
So in other words, what's happening here

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
is that Swaptree

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
solves my carrying company's sugar rush problem,

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000
a problem the economists call "the coincidence of wants,"

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000
in approximately 60 seconds.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000
What's even more amazing is it will print out a postage label on the spot,

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
because it knows the way of the item.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
Now there are layers of technical wonder

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000
behind sites such as Swaptree,

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000
but that's not my interest,

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000
and nor is swap trading, per se.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
My passion, and what I've spent the last few years

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
dedicated to researching,

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000
is the collaborative behaviors and trust-mechanics

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000
inherent in these systems.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
When you think about it,

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000
it would have seemed like a crazy idea, even a few years ago,

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000
that I would swap my stuff with a total stranger

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000
whose real name I didn't know

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000
and without any money changing hands.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
Yet 99 percent of trades on Swaptree

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
happen successfully,

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000
and the one percent that receive a negative rating,

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
it's for relatively minor reasons,

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000
like the item didn't arrive on time.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000
So what's happening here?

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000
An extremely powerful dynamic

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.000
that has huge commercial and cultural implications

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
is at play.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000
Namely, that technology

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
is enabling

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000
trust between strangers.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000
We now live in a global village

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000
where we can mimic the ties

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.000
that used to happen face to face,

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000
but on a scale and in ways

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000
that have never been possible before.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000
So what's actually happening

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000
is that social networks and real-time technologies

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000
are taking us back.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000
We're bartering, trading,

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000
swapping, sharing,

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000
but they're being reinvented

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000
into dynamic and appealing forms.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000
What I find fascinating

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000
is that we've actually wired our world to share,

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000
whether that's our neighborhood, our school,

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.000
our office, or our Facebook network,

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000
and that's creating an economy

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000
of "what's mine is yours."

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000
From the mighty eBay,

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000
the grandfather of exchange marketplaces,

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.000
to car-sharing companies such as GoGet,

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.000
where you pay a monthly fee to rent cars by the hour,

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.000
to social lending platforms such as Zopa,

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000
that will take anyone in this audience

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000
with 100 dollars to lend,

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.000
and match them with a borrower anywhere in the world,

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.000
we're sharing and collaborating again

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000
in ways that I believe

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.000
are more hip than hippie.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.000
I call this "groundswell collaborative consumption."

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000
Now before I dig into the different systems

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000
of collaborative consumption,

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000
I'd like to try and answer the question

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.000
that every author rightfully gets asked,

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.000
which is, where did this idea come from?

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000
Now I'd like to say I woke up one morning

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000
and said, "I'm going to write about collaborative consumption,"

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000
but actually it was a complicated web

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.000
of seemingly disconnected ideas.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000
Over the next minute,

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000
you're going to see a bit like a conceptual fireworks display

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.000
of all the dots that went on in my head.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000
The first thing I began to notice:

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000
how many big concepts were emerging --

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.000
from the wisdom of crowds to smart mobs --

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000
around how ridiculously easy it is

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000
to form groups for a purpose.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000
And linked to this crowd mania

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000
were examples all around the world --

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000
from the election of a president

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000
to the infamous Wikipedia, and everything in between --

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.000
on what the power of numbers could achieve.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.000
Now, you know when you learn a new word,

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.000
and then you start to see that word everywhere?

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000
That's what happened to me

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000
when I noticed that we are moving

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000
from passive consumers

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.000
to creators,

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.000
to highly enabled collaborators.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.000
What's happening

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000
is the Internet is removing the middleman,

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000
so that anyone from a T-shirt designer

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000
to a knitter

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000
can make a living selling peer-to-peer.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.000
And the ubiquitous force

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.000
of this peer-to-peer revolution

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.000
means that sharing is happening at phenomenal rates.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.000
I mean, it's amazing to think

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.000
that, in every single minute of this speech,

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.000
25 hours

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.000
of YouTube video will be loaded.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.000
Now what I find fascinating about these examples

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000
is how they're actually tapping into

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000
our primate instincts.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000
I mean, we're monkeys,

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000
and we're born and bred to share and cooperate.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.000
And we were doing so for thousands of years,

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.000
whether it's when we hunted in packs,

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.000
or farmed in cooperatives,

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.000
before this big system called hyper-consumption came along

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.000
and we built these fences

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.000
and created out own little fiefdoms.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000
But things are changing,

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000
and one of the reasons why

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:52.000
is the digital natives, or Gen-Y.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000
They're growing up sharing --

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000
files, video games, knowledge.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.000
It's second nature to them.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:01.000
So we, the millennials -- I am just a millennial --

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:04.000
are like foot soldiers,

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.000
moving us from a culture of "me" to a culture of "we."

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.000
The reason why it's happening so fast

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.000
is because of mobile collaboration.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.000
We now live in a connected age

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:16.000
where we can locate anyone, anytime, in real-time,

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:19.000
from a small device in our hands.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.000
All of this was going through my head

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.000
towards the end of 2008,

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:26.000
when, of course, the great financial crash happened.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.000
Thomas Friedman is one of my favorite New York Times columnists,

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000
and he poignantly commented

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:34.000
that 2008 is when we hit a wall,

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:37.000
when Mother Nature and the market

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.000
both said, "No more."

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.000
Now we rationally know

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:44.000
that an economy built on hyper-consumption

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:47.000
is a Ponzi scheme. It's a house of cards.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:50.000
Yet, it's hard for us to individually know what to do.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:53.000
So all of this is a lot of twittering, right?

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.000
Well it was a lot of noise and complexity in my head,

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.000
until actually I realized it was happening

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.000
because of four key drivers.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:02.000
One, a renewed belief in the importance of community,

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:05.000
and a very redefinition of what friend and neighbor really means.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:08.000
A torrent of peer-to-peer social networks

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.000
and real-time technologies,

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:13.000
fundamentally changing the way we behave.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:16.000
Three, pressing unresolved environmental concerns.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.000
And four, a global recession

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.000
that has fundamentally shocked

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.000
consumer behaviors.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.000
These four drivers

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000
are fusing together

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000
and creating the big shift --

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.000
away from the 20th century,

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000
defined by hyper-consumption,

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.000
towards the 21st century,

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:37.000
defined by collaborative consumption.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:40.000
I generally believe we're at an inflection point

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000
where the sharing behaviors --

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.000
through sites such as Flickr and Twitter

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000
that are becoming second nature online --

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:49.000
are being applied to offline areas of our everyday lives.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:52.000
From morning commutes to the way fashion is designed

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.000
to the way we grow food,

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:57.000
we are consuming and collaborating once again.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:02.000
So my co-author, Roo Rogers, and I

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000
have actually gathered thousands of examples

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.000
from all around the world of collaborative consumption.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.000
And although they vary enormously

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.000
in scale, maturity and purpose,

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.000
when we dived into them,

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.000
we realized that they could actually be organized into three clear systems.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:18.000
The first is redistribution markets.

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:21.000
Redistribution markets, just like Swaptree,

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.000
are when you take a used, or pre-owned, item

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.000
and move it from where it's not needed

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:28.000
to somewhere, or someone, where it is.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.000
They're increasingly thought of as the fifth 'R' --

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.000
reduce, reuse, recycle, repair

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.000
and redistribute --

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.000
because they stretch the life cycle of a product

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.000
and thereby reduce waste.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:41.000
The second is collaborative lifestyles.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.000
This is the sharing of resources

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:46.000
of things like money, skills and time.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.000
I bet, in a couple of years,

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.000
that phrases like "coworking"

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:53.000
and "couchsurfing" and "time banks"

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:56.000
are going to become a part of everyday vernacular.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:59.000
One of my favorite examples of collaborative lifestyles

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.000
is called Landshare.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.000
It's a scheme in the U.K.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.000
that matches Mr. Jones,

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:08.000
with some spare space in his back garden,

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:11.000
with Mrs. Smith, a would-be grower.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.000
Together they grow their own food.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:16.000
It's one of those ideas that's so simple, yet brilliant,

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:19.000
you wonder why it's never been done before.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.000
Now, the third system

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.000
is product-service systems.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.000
This is where you pay for the benefit of the product --

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.000
what it does for you --

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.000
without needing to own the product outright.

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:32.000
This idea is particularly powerful

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.000
for things that have

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.000
high-idling capacity.

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.000
And that can be anything from baby goods

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.000
to fashions to --

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.000
how many of you have a power drill,

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.000
own a power drill? Right.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:47.000
That power drill will be used around 12 to 13 minutes

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.000
in its entire lifetime.

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.000
(Laughter)

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:53.000
It's kind of ridiculous, right?

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.000
Because what you need is the hole, not the drill.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.000
(Laughter)

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.000
(Applause)

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.000
So why don't you rent the drill,

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:03.000
or, even better, rent out your own drill to other people

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:05.000
and make some money from it?

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:08.000
These three systems are coming together,

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.000
allowing people to share resources

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.000
without sacrificing their lifestyles,

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.000
or their cherished personal freedoms.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.000
I'm not asking people

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.000
to share nicely in the sandpit.

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.000
So I want to just give you an example

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.000
of how powerful collaborative consumption can be

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.000
to change behaviors.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.000
The average car

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:31.000
costs 8,000 dollars a year to run.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:33.000
Yet, that car sits idle

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.000
for 23 hours a day.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:37.000
So when you consider these two facts,

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.000
it starts to make a little less sense

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:42.000
that we have to own one outright.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:44.000
So this is where car-sharing companies

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:46.000
such as Zipcar and GoGet come in.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.000
In 2009,

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.000
Zipcar took 250 participants

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:53.000
from across 13 cities --

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.000
and they're all self-confessed car addicts

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:57.000
and car-sharing rookies --

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:00.000
and got them to surrender their keys for a month.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.000
Instead, these people had to walk,

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.000
bike, take the train,

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.000
or other forms of public transport.

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.000
They could only use their Zipcar membership

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.000
when absolutely necessary.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:13.000
The results of this challenge after just one month

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:15.000
was staggering.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:17.000
It's amazing that 413 lbs were lost

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:20.000
just from the extra exercise.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.000
But my favorite statistic

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:24.000
is that 100

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:27.000
out of the 250 participants

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:30.000
did not want their keys back.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.000
In other words, the car addicts

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.000
had lost their urge to own.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:37.000
Now products-service systems have been around for years.

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.000
Just think of libraries and laundrettes.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:41.000
But I think they're entering a new age,

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.000
because technology makes sharing

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:45.000
frictionless and fun.

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:48.000
There's a great quote that was written in the New York Times

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.000
that said, "Sharing is to ownership

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:53.000
what the iPod is to the 8-track,

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:56.000
what solar power is to the coal mine."

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:59.000
I believe also, our generation,

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:02.000
our relationship to satisfying what we want

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:04.000
is far less tangible

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:06.000
than any other previous generation.

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:09.000
I don't want the DVD; I want the movie it carries.

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:11.000
I don't want a clunky answering machine;

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:13.000
I want the message it saves.

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:16.000
I don't want a CD; I want the music it plays.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:19.000
In other words, I don't want stuff;

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:22.000
I want the needs or experiences it fulfills.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:25.000
This is fueling a massive shift

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:27.000
from where usage trumps possessions --

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:30.000
or as Kevin Kelly, the editor of Wired magazine, puts it,

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:33.000
"where access is better than ownership."

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:35.000
Now as our possessions

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:37.000
dematerialize into the cloud,

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:39.000
a blurry line is appearing

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:41.000
between what's mine, what's yours,

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:43.000
and what's ours.

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:45.000
I want to give you one example

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:48.000
that shows how fast this evolution is happening.

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:51.000
This represents an eight-year time span.

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:54.000
We've gone from traditional car-ownership

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:57.000
to car-sharing companies, such as Zipcar and GoGet,

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:00.000
to ride-sharing platforms that match rides

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:03.000
to the newest entry, which is peer-to-peer car rental,

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:06.000
where you can actually make money

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:09.000
out of renting that car that sits idle for 23 hours a day

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:11.000
to your neighbor.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:13.000
Now all of these systems

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:15.000
require a degree of trust,

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:17.000
and the cornerstone to this working

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:19.000
is reputation.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:21.000
Now in the old consumer system,

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:23.000
our reputation didn't matter so much,

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:25.000
because our credit history was far more important

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:28.000
that any kind of peer-to-peer review.

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:31.000
But now with the Web, we leave a trail.

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:34.000
With every spammer we flag,

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:37.000
with every idea we post, comment we share,

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.000
we're actually signaling how well we collaborate,

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:42.000
and whether we can or can't be trusted.

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:44.000
Let's go back to my first example,

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.000
Swaptree.

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.000
I can see that Rondoron

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:51.000
has completed 553 trades

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:54.000
with a 100 percent success rate.

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:57.000
In other words, I can trust him or her.

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:00.000
Now mark my words,

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.000
it's only a matter of time

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:05.000
before we're going to be able to perform a Google-like search

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:07.000
and see a cumulative picture

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:09.000
of our reputation capital.

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:11.000
And this reputation capital

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:14.000
will determine our access to collaborative consumption.

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:16.000
It's a new social currency, so to speak,

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:19.000
that could become as powerful as our credit rating.

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:22.000
Now as a closing thought,

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:25.000
I believe we're actually in a period

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:27.000
where we're waking up

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:29.000
from this humongous hangover

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:31.000
of emptiness and waste,

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:33.000
and we're taking a leap

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:35.000
to create a more sustainable system

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:37.000
built to serve our innate needs

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:40.000
for community and individual identity.

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:42.000
I believe it will be referred to

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:44.000
as a revolution, so to speak --

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:47.000
when society, faced with great challenges,

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:49.000
made a seismic shift

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:51.000
from individual getting and spending

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:54.000
towards a rediscovery of collective good.

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:57.000
I'm on a mission to make sharing cool.

00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:59.000
I'm on a mission to make sharing hip.

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:01.000
Because I really believe

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:03.000
it can disrupt outdated modes of business,

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:05.000
help us leapfrog

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:07.000
over wasteful forms of hyper-consumption

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:10.000
and teach us when enough really is enough.

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:12.000
Thank you very much.

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:14.000
(Applause)
