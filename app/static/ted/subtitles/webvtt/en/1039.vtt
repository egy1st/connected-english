WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Beverly Joubert: We are truly passionate

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
about the African wilderness

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
and protecting the African wilderness,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
and so what we've done

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
is we've focused on iconic cats.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
And I know,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
in the light of human suffering and poverty

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
and even climate change,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
one would wonder,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
why worry about a few cats?

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Well today we're here

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
to share with you a message that we have learned

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
from a very important and special character --

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
this leopard.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Dereck Joubert: Well, our lives have basically been

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
like a super long episode of "CSI" --

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
something like 28 years.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
In essence, what we've done

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
is we've studied the science, we've looked at the behavior,

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
we've seen over 2,000 kills

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
by these amazing animals.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
But one of the things that science really lets us down on

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
is that personality,

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
that individual personality that these animals have.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
And here's a prime example.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
We found this leopard in a 2,000-year-old

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
baobab tree in Africa,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
the same tree that we found her mother in

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
and her grandmother.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
And she took us on a journey

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
and revealed something very special to us --

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
her own daughter, eight days old.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
And the minute we found this leopard,

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
we realized that we needed to move in,

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
and so we basically stayed with this leopard

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
for the next four-and-a-half years --

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
following her every day,

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
getting to know her,

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
that individual personality of hers,

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
and really coming to know her.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
Now I'm destined

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
to spend a lot of time

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
with some unique,

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
very, very special,

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
individualistic

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
and often seductive female characters.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
(Laughter)

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
Beverly's clearly one of them,

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
and this little leopard, Legadema, is another,

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
and she changed our lives.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
BJ: Well we certainly did spend a lot of time with her --

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
in fact, more time than even her mother did.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
When her mother would go off hunting,

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
we would stay and film.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
And early on, a lightning bolt hit a tree

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
20 paces away from us.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
It was frightening,

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000
and it showered us with leaves and a pungent smell.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
And of course, we were stunned for a while,

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000
but when we managed to get our wits about us,

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
we looked at it and said, "My gosh,

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
what's going to happen with that little cub?

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
She's probably going to forever associate

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000
that deafening crash with us."

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
Well, we needn't have worried.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
She came charging out of the thicket straight towards us,

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
sat next to us, shivering,

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
with her back towards Dereck, and looking out.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
And actually from that day on,

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
she's been comfortable with us.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
So we felt that that day

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
was the day that she really earned her name.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
We called her Legadema,

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000
which means, "light from the sky."

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
DJ: Now we've found these individualisms

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
in all sorts of animals,

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
in particular in the cats.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
This particular one is called Eetwidomayloh,

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
"he who greets with fire,"

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000
and you can just see that about him, you know -- that's his character.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000
But only by getting up close to these animals

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
and spending time with them

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
can we actually even reach out

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000
and dig out these personal characters that they have.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
BJ: But through our investigation,

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000
we have to seek the wildest places in Africa.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000
And right now this is in the Okavango Delta

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000
in Botswana.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.000
Yes, it is swamp. We live in the swamp in a tent,

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.000
but I must tell you, every day is exhilarating.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
But also, our hearts are in our throats

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
a huge amount of the time,

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000
because we're driving through water,

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000
and it's an unknown territory.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000
But we're really there

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.000
seeking and searching and filming the iconic cats.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000
DJ: Now one of the big things, of course,

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.000
everybody knows that cats hate water,

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000
and so this was a real revelation for us.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.000
And we could only find this by pushing ourselves,

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000
by going where no sane person should go --

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.000
not without some prompting, by the way, from Beverly --

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
and just pushing the envelope,

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.000
going out there, pushing our vehicle, pushing ourselves.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000
But we've managed to find that these lions

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000
are 15 percent bigger than any others,

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.000
and they specialize in hunting buffalo in the water.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000
BJ: And then of course, the challenge

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.000
is knowing when to turn around.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000
We don't always get that right,

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000
and on this particular day,

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000
we seriously underestimated the depth.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000
We got deeper and deeper,

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
until it was at Dereck's chest-height.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000
Well then we hit a deep depression,

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.000
and we seriously submerged the vehicle.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000
We actually managed to drown

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.000
two million dollars' worth of camera gear.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000
We drowned our pride, I must tell you,

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000
which was really serious,

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.000
and we seized the engine.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000
DJ: And of course, one of the rules that we have in the vehicle

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000
is that he who drowns the vehicle

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
gets to swim with the crocodiles.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000
(Laughter)

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000
You will notice also that all of these images here

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000
are taken from the top angle by Beverly --

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000
the dry top angle, by the way.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000
(Laughter)

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000
But all the places we get stuck in really have great views.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000
And it wasn't a moment, and these lions came back towards us,

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000
and Beverly was able to get a great photograph.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000
BJ: But we truly do

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000
spend day and night

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000
trying to capture unique footage.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000
And 20 years ago,

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000
we did a film called "Eternal Enemies"

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000
where we managed to capture

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.000
this unusual disturbing behavior across two species --

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000
lions and hyenas.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.000
And surprisingly, it became a cult film.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.000
And we can only work that out

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.000
as people were seeing parallels

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.000
between the thuggish side of nature

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000
and gang warfare.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.000
DJ: It was amazing, because you can see that this lion

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000
is doing exactly what his name,

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000
Eetwidomayloh, represents.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.000
He's focused on this hyena,

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.000
and he is going to get it.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:56.000
(Animal sounds)

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.000
But that's, I think, what this is all about,

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.000
is that these individuals have these personalities and characters.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.000
But for us to get them, not only do we push ourselves,

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.000
but we live by certain rules of engagement,

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000
which mean we can't interfere.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000
This sort of behavior has been going on

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000
for three, four, five million years,

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.000
and we can't step in and say, "That's wrong, and that's right."

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.000
But that's not always easy for us.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000
BJ: So, as Dereck says,

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000
we have to work through extremes --

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000
extreme temperatures, push ourselves at night.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.000
Sleep deprivation is extreme.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000
We're on the edge

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.000
through a large part of the time.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.000
But, for 10 years, we tried to capture

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.000
lions and elephants together --

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.000
and never ever managed

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000
until this particular night.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.000
And I have to tell you

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000
that it was a disturbing night for me.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000
I had tears rolling down my cheeks.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:52.000
I was shaking with anxiety,

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000
but I knew that [I had] to capture something

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.000
that had never been seen before, had never been documented.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.000
And I do believe you should stay with us.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.000
DJ: The amazing thing about these moments --

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.000
and this is probably a highlight of our career --

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.000
is that you never know how it's going to end.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.000
Many people believe, in fact,

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.000
that death begins in the eyes, not in the heart,

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.000
not in the lungs,

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.000
and that's when people give up hope,

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.000
or when any life form gives up hope.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:28.000
And you can see the start of it here.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:32.000
This elephant, against overwhelming odds,

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.000
simply gives up hope.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:49.000
But by the same token,

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:52.000
you can get your hope back again.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:56.000
So just when you think it's all over, something else happens,

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.000
some spark gets into you,

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:01.000
some sort of will to fight --

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.000
that iron will that we all have,

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.000
that this elephant has,

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:08.000
that conservation has, that big cats have.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:11.000
Everything has that will to survive,

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.000
to fight, to push through that mental barrier

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:16.000
and to keep going.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.000
And for us, in many ways,

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.000
this elephant has become

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.000
a symbol of inspiration for us,

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:25.000
a symbol of that hope as we go forward in our work.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:36.000
(Applause)

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.000
Now back to the leopard.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.000
We were spending so much time with this leopard

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000
and getting to understand her individualism,

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.000
her personal character,

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:47.000
that maybe we were taking it a little bit far.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.000
We were perhaps taking her for granted,

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000
and maybe she didn't like that that much.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.000
This is about couples working together,

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:56.000
and so I do need to say that within the vehicle

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:59.000
we have quite strict territories, Beverly and I.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.000
Beverly sits on the one side

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.000
where all her camera gear is,

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:06.000
and I'm on the other side where my space is.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:09.000
These are precious to us, these divides.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.000
BJ: But when this little cub saw

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.000
that I had vacated my seat

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.000
and climbed to the back to get some camera gear,

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.000
she came in like a curious cat

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.000
to come and investigate.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:22.000
It was phenomenal, and we felt grateful

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.000
that she trusted us to that extent.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.000
But at the same time, we were concerned

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.000
that if she created this as a habit

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.000
and jumped into somebody else's car,

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.000
it might not turn out the same way --

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.000
she might get shot for that.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:37.000
So we knew we had to react quickly.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:40.000
And the only way we thought we could

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.000
without scaring her

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:44.000
is to try and simulate a growl like her mother would make --

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.000
a hiss and a sound.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.000
So Dereck turned on the heater fan in the car --

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.000
very innovative.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.000
DJ: It was the only way for me to save the marriage,

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.000
because Beverly felt she was being replaced, you see.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:57.000
(Laughter)

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.000
But really and truly, this was how

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.000
this little leopard was displaying

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.000
her individual personality.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.000
But nothing prepared us

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.000
for what happened next in our relationship with her,

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.000
when she started hunting.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:12.000
BJ: And on this first hunt, we truly were excited.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.000
It was like watching a graduation ceremony.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.000
We felt like we were surrogate parents.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.000
And of course, we knew now

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.000
that she was going to survive.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:23.000
But only when we saw the tiny baby baboon

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.000
clinging to the mother's fur

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.000
did we realize that something very unique

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:30.000
was taking place here with Legadema.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:33.000
And of course, the baby baboon was so innocent,

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.000
it didn't turn and run.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.000
So what we watched

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.000
over the next couple of hours

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.000
was very unique.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.000
It was absolutely amazing

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.000
when she picked it up to safety,

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:49.000
protecting it from the hyena.

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:52.000
And over the next five hours,

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:54.000
she took care of it.

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:57.000
We realized that we actually don't know everything,

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:01.000
and that nature is so unpredictable,

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:04.000
we have to be open at all times.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:06.000
DJ: Okay, so she was a little bit rough.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:11.000
(Laughter)

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:14.000
But in fact,

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:18.000
what we were seeing here was interesting.

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:21.000
Because she is a cub wanting to play,

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:24.000
but she was also a predator needing to kill,

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.000
and yet conflicted in some way,

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:29.000
because she was also an emerging mother.

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.000
She had this maternal instinct,

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:34.000
much like a young girl on her way to womanhood,

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:38.000
and so this really took us to this new level

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:41.000
of understanding that personality.

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:46.000
BJ: And of course, through the night, they lay together.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.000
They ended up sleeping for hours.

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.000
But I have to tell you --

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.000
everybody always asks, "What happened to the baby baboon?"

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.000
It did die,

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:57.000
and we suspect it was from the freezing winter nights.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.000
DJ: So at this stage, I guess,

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.000
we had very, very firm ideas

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.000
on what conservation meant.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:07.000
We had to deal with these individual personalities.

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:10.000
We had to deal with them with respect

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.000
and celebrate them.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:15.000
And so we, with the National Geographic, formed the Big Cats Initiative

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:17.000
to march forward into conservation,

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:19.000
taking care of the big cats that we loved --

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:22.000
and then had an opportunity to look back over the last 50 years

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:25.000
to see how well we had all collectively been doing.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.000
So when Beverly and I were born,

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:29.000
there were 450,000 lions,

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:32.000
and today there are 20,000.

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.000
Tigers haven't fared any better --

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.000
45,000

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.000
down to maybe 3,000.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.000
BJ: And then cheetahs have crashed

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:42.000
all the way down to 12,000.

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:44.000
Leopards have plummeted

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:46.000
from 700,000

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.000
down to a mere 50,000.

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.000
Now in the extraordinary time

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:52.000
that we have worked with Legadema --

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.000
which is really over a five-year period --

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:57.000
10,000 leopards were legally shot

00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:59.000
by safari hunters.

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.000
And that's not the only leopards

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:03.000
that were being killed through that period.

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:06.000
There's an immense amount of poaching as well,

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.000
and so possibly the same amount.

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:10.000
It's simply not sustainable.

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.000
We admire them,

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.000
and we fear them,

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:17.000
and yet, as man, we want to steal their power.

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:21.000
It used to be the time

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:24.000
where only kings wore a leopard skin,

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.000
but now throughout rituals and ceremonies,

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:29.000
traditional healers and ministers.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:32.000
And of course, looking at this lion paw

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.000
that has been skinned,

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:36.000
it eerily reminds me

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.000
of a human hand,

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:41.000
and that's ironic, because their fate is in our hands.

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:43.000
DJ: There's a burgeoning bone trade.

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:46.000
South Africa just released some lion bones onto the market.

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:49.000
Lion bones and tiger bones look exactly the same,

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:52.000
and so in a stroke, the lion bone industry

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:55.000
is going to wipe out all the tigers.

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.000
So we have a real problem here,

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:00.000
no more so than the lions do, the male lions.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:03.000
So the 20,000 lion figure that you just saw

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:05.000
is actually a red herring,

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:08.000
because there may be 3,000 or 4,000 male lions,

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:10.000
and they all are actually

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:12.000
infected with the same disease.

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:14.000
I call it complacency --

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.000
our complacency.

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:19.000
Because there's a sport, there's an activity going on

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:22.000
that we're all aware of, that we condone.

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:27.000
And that's probably because we haven't seen it

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:29.000
like we are today.

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:33.000
BJ: And you have to know

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:35.000
that, when a male lion is killed,

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:38.000
it completely disrupts the whole pride.

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:40.000
A new male comes into the area

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.000
and takes over the pride,

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:45.000
and, of course, first of all kills all the cubs

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:48.000
and possibly some of the females that are defending their cubs.

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:50.000
So we've estimated

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:53.000
that between 20 [and] 30 lions are killed

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:56.000
when one lion is hanging on a wall

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:58.000
somewhere in a far-off place.

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:00.000
DJ: So what our investigations have shown

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.000
is that these lions are essential.

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:04.000
They're essential to the habitat.

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:06.000
If they disappear,

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:09.000
whole ecosystems in Africa disappear.

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:11.000
There's an 80-billion-dollar-a-year

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:14.000
ecotourism revenue stream into Africa.

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:17.000
So this is not just a concern about lions;

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:20.000
it's a concern about communities in Africa as well.

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:23.000
If they disappear, all of that goes away.

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:26.000
But what I'm more concerned about in many ways

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:29.000
is that, as we de-link ourselves from nature,

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:31.000
as we de-link ourselves spiritually

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:33.000
from these animals,

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:36.000
we lose hope,

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:39.000
we lose that spiritual connection,

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:42.000
our dignity, that thing within us

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:44.000
that keeps us connected to the planet.

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:47.000
BJ: So you have to know, looking into the eyes

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:50.000
of lions and leopards right now,

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:52.000
it is all about critical awareness.

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:54.000
And so what we are doing,

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:57.000
in February, we're bringing out a film called "The Last Lion,"

00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:59.000
and "The Last Lion" is exactly

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:01.000
what is happening right now.

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:03.000
That is the situation we're in --

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:05.000
the last lions.

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:07.000
That is, if we don't take action and do something,

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:09.000
these plains will be completely devoid

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:11.000
of big cats,

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:14.000
and then, in turn, everything else will disappear.

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:16.000
And simply, if we can't protect them,

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:19.000
we're going to have a job protecting ourselves as well.

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:22.000
DJ: And in fact, that original thing that we spoke about

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:24.000
and designed our lives by --

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:26.000
that conservation was all about respect

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:28.000
and celebration --

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:31.000
is probably true. That's really what it needs.

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:34.000
We need it. We respect and celebrate each other

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:37.000
as a man and a woman, as a community

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:39.000
and as part of this planet,

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:41.000
and we need to continue that.

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:43.000
And Legadema?

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:45.000
Well we can report, in fact,

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:47.000
that we're grandparents.

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:49.000
(Laughter)

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:51.000
BJ/DJ: Thank you very much.

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:58.000
(Applause)
