00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:05.341
So for any of us in this room today,
let's start out by admitting we're lucky.

00:00:05.365 --> 00:00:08.192
We don't live in the world
our mothers lived in,

00:00:08.216 --> 00:00:09.455
our grandmothers lived in,

00:00:09.479 --> 00:00:11.967
where career choices
for women were so limited.

00:00:12.368 --> 00:00:13.976
And if you're in this room today,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.744
most of us grew up in a world
where we have basic civil rights,

00:00:18.768 --> 00:00:22.691
and amazingly, we still live in a world
where some women don't have them.

00:00:23.381 --> 00:00:26.086
But all that aside,
we still have a problem,

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:27.325
and it's a real problem.

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:28.976
And the problem is this:

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.172
Women are not making it
to the top of any profession

00:00:33.196 --> 00:00:34.568
anywhere in the world.

00:00:35.094 --> 00:00:37.527
The numbers tell the story quite clearly.

00:00:37.551 --> 00:00:40.589
190 heads of state --
nine are women.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.466
Of all the people
in parliament in the world,

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:45.339
13 percent are women.

00:00:45.798 --> 00:00:48.642
In the corporate sector, women at the top,

00:00:48.666 --> 00:00:50.976
C-level jobs, board seats --

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.741
tops out at 15, 16 percent.

00:00:53.765 --> 00:00:56.717
The numbers have not moved since 2002

00:00:56.741 --> 00:00:58.690
and are going in the wrong direction.

00:00:59.212 --> 00:01:01.344
And even in the non-profit world,

00:01:01.368 --> 00:01:04.640
a world we sometimes think of
as being led by more women,

00:01:04.664 --> 00:01:06.976
women at the top: 20 percent.

00:01:08.022 --> 00:01:09.440
We also have another problem,

00:01:09.464 --> 00:01:11.854
which is that women face harder choices

00:01:11.878 --> 00:01:14.976
between professional success
and personal fulfillment.

00:01:15.475 --> 00:01:20.521
A recent study in the U.S.
showed that, of married senior managers,

00:01:20.545 --> 00:01:22.976
two-thirds of the married men had children

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.706
and only one-third
of the married women had children.

00:01:26.669 --> 00:01:28.679
A couple of years ago, I was in New York,

00:01:28.703 --> 00:01:30.159
and I was pitching a deal,

00:01:30.183 --> 00:01:33.534
and I was in one of those fancy
New York private equity offices

00:01:33.558 --> 00:01:34.731
you can picture.

00:01:34.755 --> 00:01:37.565
And I'm in the meeting --
it's about a three-hour meeting --

00:01:37.589 --> 00:01:40.748
and two hours in,
there needs to be that bio break,

00:01:40.772 --> 00:01:42.579
and everyone stands up,

00:01:42.603 --> 00:01:45.889
and the partner running the meeting
starts looking really embarrassed.

00:01:46.261 --> 00:01:50.534
And I realized he doesn't know
where the women's room is in his office.

00:01:50.558 --> 00:01:53.101
So I start looking
around for moving boxes,

00:01:53.125 --> 00:01:55.411
figuring they just moved in,
but I don't see any.

00:01:55.435 --> 00:01:58.379
And so I said, "Did you just
move into this office?"

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:00.999
And he said, "No,
we've been here about a year."

00:02:01.629 --> 00:02:05.730
And I said, "Are you telling me
that I am the only woman

00:02:05.754 --> 00:02:08.536
to have pitched a deal
in this office in a year?"

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.586
And he looked at me, and he said,

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:14.191
"Yeah. Or maybe you're the only one
who had to go to the bathroom."

00:02:14.215 --> 00:02:16.614
(Laughter)

00:02:16.638 --> 00:02:20.107
So the question is,
how are we going to fix this?

00:02:21.607 --> 00:02:24.859
How do we change these numbers at the top?

00:02:24.883 --> 00:02:26.976
How do we make this different?

00:02:27.619 --> 00:02:30.256
I want to start out by saying,
I talk about this --

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:32.976
about keeping women in the workforce --

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.589
because I really think that's the answer.

00:02:35.613 --> 00:02:37.875
In the high-income part of our workforce,

00:02:37.899 --> 00:02:39.976
in the people who end up at the top --

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.976
Fortune 500 CEO jobs,
or the equivalent in other industries --

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.647
the problem, I am convinced,
is that women are dropping out.

00:02:48.671 --> 00:02:50.976
Now people talk about this a lot,

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.014
and they talk about things
like flextime and mentoring

00:02:54.038 --> 00:02:56.523
and programs companies
should have to train women.

00:02:56.547 --> 00:02:58.452
I want to talk about none of that today,

00:02:58.476 --> 00:03:00.478
even though that's all really important.

00:03:00.502 --> 00:03:03.328
Today I want to focus
on what we can do as individuals.

00:03:03.695 --> 00:03:05.976
What are the messages
we need to tell ourselves?

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.164
What are the messages we tell
the women that work with and for us?

00:03:09.188 --> 00:03:11.273
What are the messages
we tell our daughters?

00:03:11.641 --> 00:03:14.040
Now, at the outset,
I want to be very clear

00:03:14.064 --> 00:03:16.146
that this speech comes with no judgments.

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:17.750
I don't have the right answer.

00:03:17.774 --> 00:03:19.301
I don't even have it for myself.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.976
I left San Francisco,
where I live, on Monday,

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.766
and I was getting on the plane
for this conference.

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:28.886
And my daughter, who's three,
when I dropped her off at preschool,

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:32.577
did that whole hugging-the-leg, crying,
"Mommy, don't get on the plane" thing.

00:03:32.601 --> 00:03:35.423
This is hard. I feel guilty sometimes.

00:03:35.447 --> 00:03:36.976
I know no women,

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.810
whether they're at home
or whether they're in the workforce,

00:03:39.834 --> 00:03:41.373
who don't feel that sometimes.

00:03:41.397 --> 00:03:43.976
So I'm not saying
that staying in the workforce

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:45.825
is the right thing for everyone.

00:03:46.328 --> 00:03:48.976
My talk today is about
what the messages are

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.357
if you do want to stay in the workforce,

00:03:51.381 --> 00:03:52.976
and I think there are three.

00:03:53.515 --> 00:03:55.503
One, sit at the table.

00:03:55.904 --> 00:03:58.314
Two, make your partner a real partner.

00:03:59.206 --> 00:04:02.976
And three, don't leave before you leave.

00:04:03.796 --> 00:04:05.258
Number one: sit at the table.

00:04:05.854 --> 00:04:07.679
Just a couple weeks ago at Facebook,

00:04:07.703 --> 00:04:09.976
we hosted a very senior
government official,

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.221
and he came in to meet with senior execs

00:04:13.245 --> 00:04:14.846
from around Silicon Valley.

00:04:15.354 --> 00:04:17.536
And everyone kind of sat at the table.

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:20.132
He had these two women
who were traveling with him

00:04:20.156 --> 00:04:21.976
pretty senior in his department,

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:23.286
and I kind of said to them,

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:25.524
"Sit at the table.
Come on, sit at the table,"

00:04:25.548 --> 00:04:27.311
and they sat on the side of the room.

00:04:28.533 --> 00:04:30.485
When I was in college, my senior year,

00:04:30.509 --> 00:04:33.008
I took a course called
European Intellectual History.

00:04:33.032 --> 00:04:35.239
Don't you love that kind
of thing from college?

00:04:35.263 --> 00:04:36.976
I wish I could do that now.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:38.976
And I took it with my roommate, Carrie,

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.540
who was then a brilliant
literary student --

00:04:41.564 --> 00:04:43.874
and went on to be a brilliant
literary scholar --

00:04:43.898 --> 00:04:45.915
and my brother -- smart guy,

00:04:45.939 --> 00:04:47.554
but a water-polo-playing pre-med,

00:04:47.578 --> 00:04:48.976
who was a sophomore.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:50.976
The three of us take this class together.

00:04:51.558 --> 00:04:55.734
And then Carrie reads all the books
in the original Greek and Latin,

00:04:55.758 --> 00:04:57.450
goes to all the lectures.

00:04:57.474 --> 00:04:59.524
I read all the books in English

00:04:59.548 --> 00:05:01.205
and go to most of the lectures.

00:05:01.229 --> 00:05:02.976
My brother is kind of busy.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.712
He reads one book of 12
and goes to a couple of lectures,

00:05:06.736 --> 00:05:09.783
marches himself up to our room

00:05:09.807 --> 00:05:12.284
a couple days before the exam
to get himself tutored.

00:05:12.857 --> 00:05:15.538
The three of us go to the exam
together, and we sit down.

00:05:15.562 --> 00:05:17.721
And we sit there for three hours --

00:05:17.745 --> 00:05:20.126
and our little blue notebooks
-- yes, I'm that old.

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:23.365
We walk out, we look at each other,
and we say, "How did you do?"

00:05:23.389 --> 00:05:26.866
And Carrie says, "Boy, I feel like
I didn't really draw out the main point

00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:28.465
on the Hegelian dialectic."

00:05:28.489 --> 00:05:31.414
And I say, "God, I really
wish I had really connected

00:05:31.438 --> 00:05:34.653
John Locke's theory of property
with the philosophers that follow."

00:05:34.677 --> 00:05:36.181
And my brother says,

00:05:36.205 --> 00:05:38.120
"I got the top grade in the class."

00:05:38.144 --> 00:05:40.089
(Laughter)

00:05:40.113 --> 00:05:42.209
"You got the top grade in the class?

00:05:42.233 --> 00:05:43.783
You don't know anything."

00:05:43.807 --> 00:05:45.207
(Laughter)

00:05:45.231 --> 00:05:49.779
The problem with these stories
is that they show what the data shows:

00:05:49.803 --> 00:05:53.293
women systematically
underestimate their own abilities.

00:05:53.317 --> 00:05:54.976
If you test men and women,

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.594
and you ask them questions
on totally objective criteria like GPAs,

00:05:58.618 --> 00:06:00.482
men get it wrong slightly high,

00:06:00.506 --> 00:06:02.593
and women get it wrong slightly low.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.976
Women do not negotiate
for themselves in the workforce.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:07.976
A study in the last two years

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.617
of people entering
the workforce out of college

00:06:10.641 --> 00:06:14.976
showed that 57 percent
of boys entering, or men, I guess,

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.401
are negotiating their first salary,

00:06:17.425 --> 00:06:19.503
and only seven percent of women.

00:06:20.137 --> 00:06:22.256
And most importantly,

00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:24.976
men attribute their success to themselves,

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.654
and women attribute it
to other external factors.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.373
If you ask men why they did a good job,

00:06:30.397 --> 00:06:32.976
they'll say, "I'm awesome.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.976
Obviously. Why are you even asking?"

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:37.976
If you ask women why they did a good job,

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:39.976
what they'll say is someone helped them,

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:41.976
they got lucky, they worked really hard.

00:06:42.646 --> 00:06:43.976
Why does this matter?

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:45.976
Boy, it matters a lot.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.976
Because no one gets to the corner office

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.554
by sitting on the side, not at the table,

00:06:51.578 --> 00:06:53.581
and no one gets the promotion

00:06:53.605 --> 00:06:56.160
if they don't think
they deserve their success,

00:06:56.184 --> 00:06:58.976
or they don't even understand
their own success.

00:06:59.852 --> 00:07:01.616
I wish the answer were easy.

00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:04.252
I wish I could go tell
all the young women I work for,

00:07:04.276 --> 00:07:05.290
these fabulous women,

00:07:05.314 --> 00:07:07.564
"Believe in yourself
and negotiate for yourself.

00:07:07.588 --> 00:07:08.976
Own your own success."

00:07:09.366 --> 00:07:11.402
I wish I could tell that to my daughter.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:13.605
But it's not that simple.

00:07:13.912 --> 00:07:17.480
Because what the data shows,
above all else, is one thing,

00:07:17.504 --> 00:07:21.805
which is that success and likeability
are positively correlated for men

00:07:21.829 --> 00:07:23.815
and negatively correlated for women.

00:07:24.621 --> 00:07:27.855
And everyone's nodding,
because we all know this to be true.

00:07:28.212 --> 00:07:30.976
There's a really good study
that shows this really well.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.191
There's a famous Harvard
Business School study

00:07:33.215 --> 00:07:34.848
on a woman named Heidi Roizen.

00:07:34.872 --> 00:07:39.276
And she's an operator
in a company in Silicon Valley,

00:07:39.300 --> 00:07:40.976
and she uses her contacts

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.536
to become a very successful
venture capitalist.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:45.976
In 2002 -- not so long ago --

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.239
a professor who was then
at Columbia University

00:07:48.263 --> 00:07:50.646
took that case
and made it [Howard] Roizen.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:54.503
And he gave the case out, both of them,
to two groups of students.

00:07:54.527 --> 00:07:57.459
He changed exactly one word:

00:07:57.483 --> 00:07:58.976
"Heidi" to "Howard."

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.976
But that one word made
a really big difference.

00:08:02.547 --> 00:08:04.178
He then surveyed the students,

00:08:04.202 --> 00:08:06.868
and the good news was the students,
both men and women,

00:08:06.892 --> 00:08:09.286
thought Heidi and Howard
were equally competent,

00:08:09.310 --> 00:08:10.588
and that's good.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.683
The bad news was
that everyone liked Howard.

00:08:13.707 --> 00:08:15.707
He's a great guy.
You want to work for him.

00:08:15.731 --> 00:08:17.731
You want to spend the day
fishing with him.

00:08:17.755 --> 00:08:19.317
But Heidi? Not so sure.

00:08:19.341 --> 00:08:22.206
She's a little out for herself.
She's a little political.

00:08:22.230 --> 00:08:24.277
You're not sure
you'd want to work for her.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:26.625
This is the complication.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.310
We have to tell our daughters
and our colleagues,

00:08:29.334 --> 00:08:32.018
we have to tell ourselves
to believe we got the A,

00:08:32.042 --> 00:08:34.976
to reach for the promotion,
to sit at the table,

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:36.779
and we have to do it in a world

00:08:36.803 --> 00:08:40.398
where, for them, there are sacrifices
they will make for that,

00:08:40.422 --> 00:08:42.709
even though for their brothers,
there are not.

00:08:43.817 --> 00:08:47.484
The saddest thing about all of this
is that it's really hard to remember this.

00:08:47.508 --> 00:08:50.556
And I'm about to tell a story
which is truly embarrassing for me,

00:08:50.580 --> 00:08:51.887
but I think important.

00:08:52.270 --> 00:08:55.467
I gave this talk at Facebook
not so long ago

00:08:55.491 --> 00:08:57.980
to about 100 employees,

00:08:58.004 --> 00:09:01.052
and a couple hours later,
there was a young woman who works there

00:09:01.076 --> 00:09:04.415
sitting outside my little desk,
and she wanted to talk to me.

00:09:04.439 --> 00:09:06.582
I said, okay, and she sat down,
and we talked.

00:09:06.606 --> 00:09:08.559
And she said, "I learned something today.

00:09:08.583 --> 00:09:10.638
I learned that I need to keep my hand up."

00:09:10.979 --> 00:09:12.011
"What do you mean?"

00:09:12.035 --> 00:09:13.829
She said, "You're giving this talk,

00:09:13.853 --> 00:09:16.150
and you said you would take
two more questions.

00:09:16.174 --> 00:09:18.254
I had my hand up with many other people,

00:09:18.278 --> 00:09:19.873
and you took two more questions.

00:09:19.897 --> 00:09:22.807
I put my hand down, and I noticed
all the women did the same,

00:09:22.831 --> 00:09:24.760
and then you took more questions,

00:09:24.784 --> 00:09:25.976
only from the men."

00:09:27.156 --> 00:09:28.447
And I thought to myself,

00:09:28.471 --> 00:09:31.276
"Wow, if it's me -- who cares
about this, obviously --

00:09:31.300 --> 00:09:33.234
giving this talk --

00:09:33.258 --> 00:09:38.976
and during this talk, I can't even notice
that the men's hands are still raised,

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:40.976
and the women's hands are still raised,

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:42.178
how good are we

00:09:42.202 --> 00:09:44.906
as managers of our companies
and our organizations

00:09:44.930 --> 00:09:47.455
at seeing that the men
are reaching for opportunities

00:09:47.479 --> 00:09:48.526
more than women?"

00:09:49.277 --> 00:09:51.667
We've got to get women
to sit at the table.

00:09:51.691 --> 00:09:52.692
(Cheers)

00:09:52.716 --> 00:09:55.924
(Applause)

00:09:55.948 --> 00:09:57.271
Message number two:

00:09:57.295 --> 00:09:59.182
Make your partner a real partner.

00:09:59.206 --> 00:10:02.397
I've become convinced that we've made
more progress in the workforce

00:10:02.421 --> 00:10:03.976
than we have in the home.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.211
The data shows this very clearly.

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:11.179
If a woman and a man
work full-time and have a child,

00:10:11.203 --> 00:10:14.556
the woman does twice the amount
of housework the man does,

00:10:14.580 --> 00:10:18.976
and the woman does three times
the amount of childcare the man does.

00:10:19.447 --> 00:10:23.197
So she's got three jobs
or two jobs, and he's got one.

00:10:23.221 --> 00:10:26.248
Who do you think drops out
when someone needs to be home more?

00:10:26.814 --> 00:10:30.624
The causes of this are really complicated,
and I don't have time to go into them.

00:10:30.648 --> 00:10:34.584
And I don't think Sunday football-watching
and general laziness is the cause.

00:10:34.608 --> 00:10:36.822
I think the cause is more complicated.

00:10:36.846 --> 00:10:38.335
I think, as a society,

00:10:38.359 --> 00:10:40.576
we put more pressure
on our boys to succeed

00:10:40.600 --> 00:10:41.976
than we do on our girls.

00:10:42.454 --> 00:10:44.482
I know men that stay home

00:10:44.506 --> 00:10:47.573
and work in the home
to support wives with careers,

00:10:47.597 --> 00:10:48.624
and it's hard.

00:10:48.648 --> 00:10:51.976
When I go to the Mommy-and-Me stuff
and I see the father there,

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:55.519
I notice that the other mommies
don't play with him.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:57.976
And that's a problem,

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:01.186
because we have to make it
as important a job,

00:11:01.210 --> 00:11:04.589
because it's the hardest job
in the world to work inside the home,

00:11:04.613 --> 00:11:06.093
for people of both genders,

00:11:06.117 --> 00:11:09.611
if we're going to even things out and let
women stay in the workforce.

00:11:09.635 --> 00:11:10.976
(Applause)

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.239
Studies show that households
with equal earning

00:11:13.263 --> 00:11:15.205
and equal responsibility

00:11:15.229 --> 00:11:17.390
also have half the divorce rate.

00:11:17.414 --> 00:11:20.598
And if that wasn't good enough motivation
for everyone out there,

00:11:20.622 --> 00:11:22.435
they also have more --

00:11:22.459 --> 00:11:24.269
how shall I say this on this stage?

00:11:24.293 --> 00:11:26.976
They know each other more
in the biblical sense as well.

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.493
(Cheers)

00:11:29.517 --> 00:11:31.452
Message number three:

00:11:31.476 --> 00:11:32.976
Don't leave before you leave.

00:11:33.539 --> 00:11:35.282
I think there's a really deep irony

00:11:35.306 --> 00:11:37.391
to the fact that actions
women are taking --

00:11:37.415 --> 00:11:38.976
and I see this all the time --

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:42.126
with the objective
of staying in the workforce

00:11:42.150 --> 00:11:44.715
actually lead to their eventually leaving.

00:11:44.739 --> 00:11:45.976
Here's what happens:

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.544
We're all busy. Everyone's busy.
A woman's busy.

00:11:48.568 --> 00:11:50.976
And she starts thinking
about having a child,

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.976
and from the moment she starts
thinking about having a child,

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.524
she starts thinking
about making room for that child.

00:11:56.997 --> 00:11:59.808
"How am I going to fit this
into everything else I'm doing?"

00:12:00.182 --> 00:12:02.832
And literally from that moment,

00:12:02.856 --> 00:12:05.150
she doesn't raise her hand anymore,

00:12:05.174 --> 00:12:08.504
she doesn't look for a promotion,
she doesn't take on the new project,

00:12:08.528 --> 00:12:10.505
she doesn't say, "Me. I want to do that."

00:12:10.529 --> 00:12:11.803
She starts leaning back.

00:12:12.202 --> 00:12:13.599
The problem is that --

00:12:13.623 --> 00:12:17.187
let's say she got pregnant
that day, that day --

00:12:17.211 --> 00:12:19.976
nine months of pregnancy,
three months of maternity leave,

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.150
six months to catch your breath --

00:12:22.174 --> 00:12:23.636
Fast-forward two years,

00:12:23.660 --> 00:12:25.620
more often -- and as I've seen it --

00:12:25.644 --> 00:12:28.158
women start thinking
about this way earlier --

00:12:28.182 --> 00:12:30.072
when they get engaged, or married,

00:12:30.096 --> 00:12:32.244
when they start thinking
about having a child,

00:12:32.268 --> 00:12:33.735
which can take a long time.

00:12:33.759 --> 00:12:35.767
One woman came to see me about this.

00:12:35.791 --> 00:12:37.520
She looked a little young.

00:12:37.544 --> 00:12:40.878
And I said, "So are you and your husband
thinking about having a baby?"

00:12:40.902 --> 00:12:42.864
And she said, "Oh no, I'm not married."

00:12:42.888 --> 00:12:44.463
She didn't even have a boyfriend.

00:12:44.487 --> 00:12:45.488
(Laughter)

00:12:45.512 --> 00:12:48.843
I said, "You're thinking about this
just way too early."

00:12:49.219 --> 00:12:51.837
But the point is that what happens

00:12:51.861 --> 00:12:54.509
once you start
kind of quietly leaning back?

00:12:55.543 --> 00:12:57.309
Everyone who's been through this --

00:12:57.333 --> 00:13:00.076
and I'm here to tell you,
once you have a child at home,

00:13:00.100 --> 00:13:02.686
your job better be really good to go back,

00:13:02.710 --> 00:13:04.853
because it's hard to leave
that kid at home.

00:13:04.877 --> 00:13:06.741
Your job needs to be challenging.

00:13:06.765 --> 00:13:08.431
It needs to be rewarding.

00:13:08.455 --> 00:13:10.976
You need to feel like you're
making a difference.

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:13.976
And if two years ago
you didn't take a promotion

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.266
and some guy next to you did,

00:13:16.290 --> 00:13:19.976
if three years ago you stopped
looking for new opportunities,

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:21.728
you're going to be bored

00:13:21.752 --> 00:13:24.445
because you should have kept
your foot on the gas pedal.

00:13:25.212 --> 00:13:27.607
Don't leave before you leave.

00:13:27.631 --> 00:13:28.976
Stay in.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:30.976
Keep your foot on the gas pedal,

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:35.631
until the very day you need to leave
to take a break for a child --

00:13:35.655 --> 00:13:37.441
and then make your decisions.

00:13:37.896 --> 00:13:40.374
Don't make decisions too far in advance,

00:13:40.398 --> 00:13:43.116
particularly ones you're not
even conscious you're making.

00:13:44.511 --> 00:13:46.252
My generation really, sadly,

00:13:46.276 --> 00:13:48.547
is not going to change
the numbers at the top.

00:13:48.571 --> 00:13:50.291
They're just not moving.

00:13:50.315 --> 00:13:53.517
We are not going to get
to where 50 percent of the population --

00:13:53.541 --> 00:13:56.208
in my generation, there will not
be 50 percent of [women]

00:13:56.232 --> 00:13:57.739
at the top of any industry.

00:13:58.870 --> 00:14:01.291
But I'm hopeful that future
generations can.

00:14:02.284 --> 00:14:06.973
I think a world where half
of our countries and our companies

00:14:06.997 --> 00:14:09.410
were run by women,
would be a better world.

00:14:09.434 --> 00:14:12.815
It's not just because people would know
where the women's bathrooms are,

00:14:12.839 --> 00:14:15.492
even though that would be very helpful.

00:14:15.516 --> 00:14:17.263
I think it would be a better world.

00:14:18.243 --> 00:14:19.518
I have two children.

00:14:19.542 --> 00:14:22.114
I have a five-year-old son
and a two-year-old daughter.

00:14:22.560 --> 00:14:24.237
I want my son to have a choice

00:14:24.261 --> 00:14:27.333
to contribute fully
in the workforce or at home,

00:14:27.357 --> 00:14:31.253
and I want my daughter
to have the choice to not just succeed,

00:14:31.277 --> 00:14:33.976
but to be liked for her accomplishments.

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:35.110
Thank you.

00:14:35.134 --> 00:14:37.000
(Applause)
