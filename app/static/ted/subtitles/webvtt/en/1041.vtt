00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.000
So today, I'm going to tell you about some people

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
who didn't move out of their neighborhoods.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
The first one is happening right here in Chicago.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Brenda Palms-Farber was hired

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
to help ex-convicts reenter society

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
and keep them from going back into prison.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Currently, taxpayers spend

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
about 60,000 dollars per year

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
sending a person to jail.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
We know that two-thirds of them are going to go back.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
I find it interesting that, for every one dollar

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
we spend, however, on early childhood education,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
like Head Start,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
we save 17 dollars

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
on stuff like incarceration in the future.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Or -- think about it -- that 60,000 dollars

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
is more than what it costs

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
to send one person to Harvard as well.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
But Brenda, not being phased by stuff like that,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
took a look at her challenge

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
and came up

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
with a not-so-obvious solution:

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
create a business

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
that produces skin care products from honey.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
Okay, it might be obvious to some of you; it wasn't to me.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
It's the basis of growing a form of social innovation

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
that has real potential.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
She hired seemingly unemployable men and women

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
to care for the bees, harvest the honey

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
and make value-added products

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
that they marketed themselves,

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
and that were later sold at Whole Foods.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
She combined employment experience and training

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
with life skills they needed,

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
like anger-management and teamwork,

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
and also how to talk to future employers

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
about how their experiences

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
actually demonstrated the lessons that they had learned

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
and their eagerness to learn more.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
Less than four percent

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
of the folks that went through her program

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
actually go back to jail.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
So these young men and women learned job-readiness

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
and life skills through bee keeping

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
and became productive citizens in the process.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
Talk about a sweet beginning.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
Now, I'm going to take you to Los Angeles,

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
and lots of people know

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
that L.A. has its issues.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
But I'm going to talk about L.A.'s water issues right now.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
They have not enough water on most days

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
and too much to handle when it rains.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
Currently, 20 percent

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
of California's energy consumption

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
is used to pump water

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
into mostly Southern California.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
Their spending loads, loads,

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
to channel that rainwater out into the ocean

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
when it rains and floods as well.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
Now Andy Lipkis is working to help

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
L.A. cut infrastructure costs

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000
associated with water management and urban heat island --

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
linking trees, people and technology

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
to create a more livable city.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000
All that green stuff actually naturally absorbs storm water,

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
also helps cool our cities.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
Because, come to think about it,

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
do you really want air-conditioning,

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
or is it a cooler room that you want?

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
How you get it shouldn't make that much of a difference.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
So a few years ago,

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
L.A. County

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000
decided that they needed to spend 2.5 billion dollars

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000
to repair the city schools.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
And Andy and his team discovered

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
that they were going to spend 200 million of those dollars

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
on asphalt to surround the schools themselves.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
And by presenting a really strong economic case,

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000
they convinced the L.A. government

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000
that replacing that asphalt

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
with trees and other greenery,

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000
that the schools themselves would save the system more on energy

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000
than they spend on horticultural infrastructure.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000
So ultimately, 20 million square feet of asphalt

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000
was replaced or avoided,

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.000
and electrical consumption for air-conditioning went down,

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000
while employment

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.000
for people to maintain those grounds went up,

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
resulting in a net-savings to the system,

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000
but also healthier students and schools system employees as well.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000
Now Judy Bonds

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000
is a coal miner's daughter.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000
Her family has eight generations

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.000
in a town called Whitesville, West Virginia.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000
And if anyone should be clinging

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000
to the former glory of the coal mining history,

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000
and of the town,

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000
it should be Judy.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000
But the way coal is mined right now is different

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000
from the deep mines that her father

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000
and her father's father would go down into

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
and that employed essentially thousands and thousands of people.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
Now, two dozen men

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000
can tear down a mountain in several months,

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.000
and only for about a few years' worth of coal.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.000
That kind of technology is called "mountaintop removal."

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.000
It can make a mountain go from this to this

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000
in a few short months.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000
Just imagine that the air surrounding these places --

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.000
it's filled with the residue of explosives and coal.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000
When we visited, it gave some of the people we were with

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000
this strange little cough

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000
after being only there for just a few hours or so --

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
not just miners, but everybody.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
And Judy saw her landscape being destroyed

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
and her water poisoned.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000
And the coal companies just move on

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000
after the mountain was emptied,

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000
leaving even more unemployment in their wake.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.000
But she also saw the difference in potential wind energy

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000
on an intact mountain,

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000
and one that was reduced in elevation

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000
by over 2,000 feet.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.000
Three years of dirty energy with not many jobs,

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
or centuries of clean energy

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.000
with the potential for developing expertise and improvements in efficiency

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000
based on technical skills,

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000
and developing local knowledge

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000
about how to get the most out of that region's wind.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000
She calculated the up-front cost

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000
and the payback over time,

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000
and it's a net-plus on so many levels

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.000
for the local, national and global economy.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.000
It's a longer payback than mountaintop removal,

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.000
but the wind energy actually pays back forever.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.000
Now mountaintop removal pays very little money to the locals,

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000
and it gives them a lot of misery.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000
The water is turned into goo.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000
Most people are still unemployed,

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000
leading to most of the same kinds of social problems

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000
that unemployed people in inner cities also experience --

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000
drug and alcohol abuse,

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.000
domestic abuse, teen pregnancy and poor heath, as well.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000
Now Judy and I -- I have to say --

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000
totally related to each other.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000
Not quite an obvious alliance.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000
I mean, literally, her hometown is called Whitesville, West Virginia.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000
I mean, they are not --

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.000
they ain't competing for the birthplace of hip hop title

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000
or anything like that.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.000
But the back of my T-shirt, the one that she gave me,

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.000
says, "Save the endangered hillbillies."

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.000
So homegirls and hillbillies we got it together

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.000
and totally understand that this is what it's all about.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.000
But just a few months ago,

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000
Judy was diagnosed

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000
with stage-three lung cancer.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.000
Yeah.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.000
And it has since moved to her bones and her brain.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.000
And I just find it so bizarre

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.000
that she's suffering from the same thing

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.000
that she tried so hard to protect people from.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000
But her dream

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000
of Coal River Mountain Wind

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000
is her legacy.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.000
And she might not

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.000
get to see that mountaintop.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.000
But rather than writing

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000
yet some kind of manifesto or something,

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000
she's leaving behind

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.000
a business plan to make it happen.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.000
That's what my homegirl is doing.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.000
So I'm so proud of that.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:55.000
(Applause)

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.000
But these three people

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.000
don't know each other,

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000
but they do have an awful lot in common.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.000
They're all problem solvers,

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.000
and they're just some of the many examples

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.000
that I really am privileged to see, meet and learn from

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000
in the examples of the work that I do now.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000
I was really lucky to have them all featured

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.000
on my Corporation for Public Radio radio show

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000
called ThePromisedLand.org.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.000
Now they're all very practical visionaries.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.000
They take a look at the demands that are out there --

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.000
beauty products, healthy schools, electricity --

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.000
and how the money's flowing to meet those demands.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.000
And when the cheapest solutions

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.000
involve reducing the number of jobs,

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000
you're left with unemployed people,

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000
and those people aren't cheap.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.000
In fact, they make up some of what I call the most expensive citizens,

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.000
and they include generationally impoverished,

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.000
traumatized vets returning from the Middle East,

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.000
people coming out of jail.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.000
And for the veterans in particular,

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:46.000
the V.A. said there's a six-fold increase

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:49.000
in mental health pharmaceuticals by vets since 2003.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.000
I think that number's probably going to go up.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.000
They're not the largest number of people,

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.000
but they are some of the most expensive --

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:58.000
and in terms of the likelihood for domestic abuse, drug and alcohol abuse,

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:01.000
poor performance by their kids in schools

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.000
and also poor health as a result of stress.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.000
So these three guys all understand

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.000
how to productively channel dollars

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.000
through our local economies

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.000
to meet existing market demands,

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.000
reduce the social problems that we have now

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:16.000
and prevent new problems in the future.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.000
And there are plenty of other examples like that.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:21.000
One problem: waste handling and unemployment.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.000
Even when we think or talk about recycling,

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:26.000
lots of recyclable stuff ends up getting incinerated or in landfills

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:29.000
and leaving many municipalities, diversion rates --

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000
they leave much to be recycled.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:34.000
And where is this waste handled? Usually in poor communities.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:37.000
And we know that eco-industrial business, these kinds of business models --

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:40.000
there's a model in Europe called the eco-industrial park,

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:43.000
where either the waste of one company is the raw material for another,

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.000
or you use recycled materials

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.000
to make goods that you can actually use and sell.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:50.000
We can create these local markets and incentives

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.000
for recycled materials

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.000
to be used as raw materials for manufacturing.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:57.000
And in my hometown, we actually tried to do one of these in the Bronx,

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:00.000
but our mayor decided what he wanted to see

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000
was a jail on that same spot.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:05.000
Fortunately -- because we wanted to create hundreds of jobs --

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.000
but after many years,

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.000
the city wanted to build a jail.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.000
They've since abandoned that project, thank goodness.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.000
Another problem: unhealthy food systems and unemployment.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.000
Working-class and poor urban Americans

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.000
are not benefiting economically

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.000
from our current food system.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.000
It relies too much on transportation,

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.000
chemical fertilization, big use of water

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.000
and also refrigeration.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.000
Mega agricultural operations

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:32.000
often are responsible for poisoning our waterways and our land,

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:35.000
and it produces this incredibly unhealthy product

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.000
that costs us billions in healthcare

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.000
and lost productivity.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.000
And so we know "urban ag"

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.000
is a big buzz topic this time of the year,

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.000
but it's mostly gardening,

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:48.000
which has some value in community building -- lots of it --

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.000
but it's not in terms of creating jobs

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.000
or for food production.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.000
The numbers just aren't there.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.000
Part of my work now is really laying the groundwork

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:59.000
to integrate urban ag and rural food systems

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:02.000
to hasten the demise of the 3,000-mile salad

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:05.000
by creating a national brand of urban-grown produce

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.000
in every city,

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.000
that uses regional growing power

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.000
and augments it with indoor growing facilities,

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.000
owned and operated by small growers,

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.000
where now there are only consumers.

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:18.000
This can support seasonal farmers around metro areas

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.000
who are losing out because they really can't meet

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:23.000
the year-round demand for produce.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.000
It's not a competition with rural farm;

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.000
it's actually reinforcements.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.000
It allies in a really positive

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.000
and economically viable food system.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:33.000
The goal is to meet the cities' institutional demands

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.000
for hospitals,

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:38.000
senior centers, schools, daycare centers,

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:41.000
and produce a network of regional jobs, as well.

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.000
This is smart infrastructure.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.000
And how we manage our built environment

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:48.000
affects the health and well-being of people every single day.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.000
Our municipalities, rural and urban,

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:53.000
play the operational course of infrastructure --

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:56.000
things like waste disposal, energy demand,

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:59.000
as well as social costs of unemployment, drop-out rates, incarceration rates

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:02.000
and the impacts of various public health costs.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:05.000
Smart infrastructure can provide cost-saving ways

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:07.000
for municipalities to handle

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.000
both infrastructure and social needs.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.000
And we want to shift the systems

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:14.000
that open the doors for people who were formerly tax burdens

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.000
to become part of the tax base.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.000
And imagine a national business model

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:21.000
that creates local jobs and smart infrastructure

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:24.000
to improve local economic stability.

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:27.000
So I'm hoping you can see a little theme here.

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.000
These examples indicate a trend.

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:32.000
I haven't created it, and it's not happening by accident.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.000
I'm noticing that it's happening all over the country,

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.000
and the good news is that it's growing.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.000
And we all need to be invested in it.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:41.000
It is an essential pillar to this country's recovery.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:44.000
And I call it "hometown security."

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:47.000
The recession has us reeling and fearful,

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.000
and there's something in the air these days

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.000
that is also very empowering.

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.000
It's a realization

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.000
that we are the key

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:57.000
to our own recovery.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:00.000
Now is the time for us to act in our own communities

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:03.000
where we think local and we act local.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:05.000
And when we do that, our neighbors --

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:07.000
be they next-door, or in the next state,

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:09.000
or in the next country --

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:12.000
will be just fine.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:15.000
The sum of the local is the global.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:18.000
Hometown security means rebuilding our natural defenses,

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.000
putting people to work,

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.000
restoring our natural systems.

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:25.000
Hometown security means creating wealth here at home,

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.000
instead of destroying it overseas.

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:29.000
Tackling social and environmental problems

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:32.000
at the same time with the same solution

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.000
yields great cost savings,

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:37.000
wealth generation and national security.

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.000
Many great and inspiring solutions

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:41.000
have been generated across America.

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.000
The challenge for us now

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:46.000
is to identify and support countless more.

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:49.000
Now, hometown security is about taking care of your own,

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:51.000
but it's not like the old saying,

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:54.000
"charity begins at home."

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:57.000
I recently read a book called "Love Leadership" by John Hope Bryant.

00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:59.000
And it's about leading in a world

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:02.000
that really does seem to be operating on the basis of fear.

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:05.000
And reading that book made me reexamine that theory

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:08.000
because I need to explain what I mean by that.

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:10.000
See, my dad

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.000
was a great, great man in many ways.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.000
He grew up in the segregated South,

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.000
escaped lynching and all that

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.000
during some really hard times,

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:21.000
and he provided a really stable home for me and my siblings

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:24.000
and a whole bunch of other people that fell on hard times.

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:28.000
But, like all of us, he had some problems.

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.000
(Laughter)

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.000
And his was gambling,

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.000
compulsively.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:37.000
To him that phrase, "Charity begins at home,"

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:40.000
meant that my payday -- or someone else's --

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:42.000
would just happen to coincide with his lucky day.

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.000
So you need to help him out.

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:46.000
And sometimes I would loan him money

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:49.000
from my after-school or summer jobs,

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:51.000
and he always had the great intention

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:53.000
of paying me back with interest,

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.000
of course, after he hit it big.

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.000
And he did sometimes, believe it or not,

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:59.000
at a racetrack in Los Angeles --

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:02.000
one reason to love L.A. -- back in the 1940s.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.000
He made 15,000 dollars cash

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:06.000
and bought the house that I grew up in.

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:08.000
So I'm not that unhappy about that.

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:11.000
But listen, I did feel obligated to him,

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:14.000
and I grew up -- then I grew up.

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.000
And I'm a grown woman now,

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.000
and I have learned a few things along the way.

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:20.000
To me, charity

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:22.000
often is just about giving,

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:24.000
because you're supposed to,

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.000
or because it's what you've always done,

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:29.000
or it's about giving until it hurts.

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:31.000
I'm about providing the means

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:33.000
to build something that will grow

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:36.000
and intensify its original investment

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:38.000
and not just require greater giving next year --

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:40.000
I'm not trying to feed the habit.

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.000
I spent some years

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:45.000
watching how good intentions for community empowerment,

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:47.000
that were supposed to be there

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:50.000
to support the community and empower it,

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:52.000
actually left people

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:55.000
in the same, if not worse, position that they were in before.

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:57.000
And over the past 20 years,

00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:59.000
we've spent record amounts of philanthropic dollars

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:01.000
on social problems,

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.000
yet educational outcomes,

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:05.000
malnutrition, incarceration,

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:07.000
obesity, diabetes, income disparity,

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:10.000
they've all gone up with some exceptions --

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:13.000
in particular, infant mortality

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:15.000
among people in poverty --

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:18.000
but it's a great world that we're bringing them into as well.

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:21.000
And I know a little bit about these issues,

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:24.000
because, for many years, I spent a long time

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:26.000
in the non-profit industrial complex,

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:28.000
and I'm a recovering executive director,

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:30.000
two years clean.

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:32.000
(Laughter)

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:35.000
But during that time, I realized that it was about projects

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:37.000
and developing them on the local level

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:40.000
that really was going to do the right thing for our communities.

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:43.000
But I really did struggle for financial support.

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:45.000
The greater our success,

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:47.000
the less money came in from foundations.

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:49.000
And I tell you, being on the TED stage

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:51.000
and winning a MacArthur in the same exact year

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:54.000
gave everyone the impression that I had arrived.

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:56.000
And by the time I'd moved on,

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:58.000
I was actually covering a third

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:01.000
of my agency's budget deficit with speaking fees.

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:03.000
And I think because early on, frankly,

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:05.000
my programs were just a little bit ahead of their time.

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:07.000
But since then,

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:10.000
the park that was just a dump and was featured at a TED2006 Talk

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:13.000
became this little thing.

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:15.000
But I did in fact get married in it.

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:17.000
Over here.

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:20.000
There goes my dog who led me to the park in my wedding.

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:25.000
The South Bronx Greenway

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:28.000
was also just a drawing on the stage back in 2006.

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:30.000
Since then, we got

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:32.000
about 50 million dollars in stimulus package money

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:34.000
to come and get here.

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:36.000
And we love this, because I love construction now,

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:38.000
because we're watching these things actually happen.

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:40.000
So I want everyone to understand

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:42.000
the critical importance

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:45.000
of shifting charity into enterprise.

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:48.000
I started my firm to help communities across the country

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:50.000
realize their own potential

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:53.000
to improve everything about the quality of life for their people.

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:55.000
Hometown security

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:57.000
is next on my to-do list.

00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:59.000
What we need are people who see the value

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:02.000
in investing in these types of local enterprises,

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:04.000
who will partner with folks like me

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:07.000
to identify the growth trends and climate adaptation

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:10.000
as well as understand the growing social costs

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:12.000
of business as usual.

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:14.000
We need to work together

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:16.000
to embrace and repair our land,

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:18.000
repair our power systems

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:20.000
and repair ourselves.

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:22.000
It's time to stop building

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:24.000
the shopping malls, the prisons,

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:26.000
the stadiums

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:29.000
and other tributes to all of our collective failures.

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:32.000
It is time that we start building

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:35.000
living monuments to hope and possibility.

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:37.000
Thank you very much.

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:39.000
(Applause)
