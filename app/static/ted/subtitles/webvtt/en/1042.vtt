00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:05.061
So, I'll start with this: a couple
years ago, an event planner called me

00:00:05.085 --> 00:00:07.134
because I was going
to do a speaking event.

00:00:07.158 --> 00:00:08.848
And she called, and she said,

00:00:08.872 --> 00:00:12.444
"I'm really struggling with how
to write about you on the little flyer."

00:00:12.468 --> 00:00:14.516
And I thought,
"Well, what's the struggle?"

00:00:15.228 --> 00:00:17.132
And she said, "Well, I saw you speak,

00:00:17.156 --> 00:00:19.641
and I'm going to call you
a researcher, I think,

00:00:19.665 --> 00:00:22.553
but I'm afraid if I call you
a researcher, no one will come,

00:00:22.577 --> 00:00:25.036
because they'll think
you're boring and irrelevant."

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:26.061
(Laughter)

00:00:26.085 --> 00:00:27.661
And I was like, "Okay."

00:00:27.685 --> 00:00:30.163
And she said, "But the thing
I liked about your talk

00:00:30.187 --> 00:00:31.403
is you're a storyteller.

00:00:31.427 --> 00:00:34.141
So I think what I'll do
is just call you a storyteller."

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:37.706
And of course, the academic,
insecure part of me

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:40.040
was like, "You're going
to call me a what?"

00:00:40.064 --> 00:00:42.612
And she said, "I'm going
to call you a storyteller."

00:00:42.636 --> 00:00:45.485
And I was like, "Why not 'magic pixie'?"

00:00:45.509 --> 00:00:47.988
(Laughter)

00:00:48.388 --> 00:00:51.666
I was like, "Let me think
about this for a second."

00:00:52.031 --> 00:00:54.570
I tried to call deep on my courage.

00:00:54.594 --> 00:00:57.706
And I thought, you know,
I am a storyteller.

00:00:57.730 --> 00:00:59.134
I'm a qualitative researcher.

00:00:59.158 --> 00:01:00.879
I collect stories; that's what I do.

00:01:01.396 --> 00:01:04.301
And maybe stories
are just data with a soul.

00:01:04.325 --> 00:01:06.706
And maybe I'm just a storyteller.

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:08.389
And so I said, "You know what?

00:01:08.413 --> 00:01:11.054
Why don't you just say
I'm a researcher-storyteller."

00:01:11.078 --> 00:01:14.706
And she went, "Ha ha.
There's no such thing."

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:16.413
(Laughter)

00:01:16.437 --> 00:01:20.414
So I'm a researcher-storyteller,
and I'm going to talk to you today --

00:01:20.438 --> 00:01:22.487
we're talking about
expanding perception --

00:01:22.511 --> 00:01:24.893
and so I want to talk to you
and tell some stories

00:01:24.917 --> 00:01:30.076
about a piece of my research
that fundamentally expanded my perception

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:32.989
and really actually changed
the way that I live and love

00:01:33.013 --> 00:01:34.187
and work and parent.

00:01:34.833 --> 00:01:36.965
And this is where my story starts.

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:40.413
When I was a young researcher,
doctoral student,

00:01:40.437 --> 00:01:44.414
my first year, I had
a research professor who said to us,

00:01:44.438 --> 00:01:48.384
"Here's the thing, if you cannot
measure it, it does not exist."

00:01:50.114 --> 00:01:52.706
And I thought he was just
sweet-talking me.

00:01:53.079 --> 00:01:55.516
I was like, "Really?"
and he was like, "Absolutely."

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:57.793
And so you have to understand

00:01:57.817 --> 00:02:00.397
that I have a bachelor's
and a master's in social work,

00:02:00.421 --> 00:02:03.795
and I was getting my Ph.D. in social work,
so my entire academic career

00:02:03.819 --> 00:02:09.436
was surrounded by people who kind of
believed in the "life's messy, love it."

00:02:10.214 --> 00:02:15.642
And I'm more of the, "life's messy,
clean it up, organize it

00:02:15.666 --> 00:02:17.443
and put it into a bento box."

00:02:17.467 --> 00:02:19.443
(Laughter)

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:25.071
And so to think that I had found my way,
to found a career that takes me --

00:02:25.095 --> 00:02:28.428
really, one of the big sayings
in social work is,

00:02:28.452 --> 00:02:30.547
"Lean into the discomfort of the work."

00:02:31.277 --> 00:02:33.809
And I'm like, knock discomfort
upside the head

00:02:33.833 --> 00:02:36.111
and move it over and get all A's.

00:02:36.135 --> 00:02:38.047
That was my mantra.

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:41.706
So I was very excited about this.

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:44.706
And so I thought, you know what,
this is the career for me,

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:47.706
because I am interested
in some messy topics.

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:50.101
But I want to be able
to make them not messy.

00:02:50.125 --> 00:02:51.447
I want to understand them.

00:02:51.471 --> 00:02:55.048
I want to hack into these things
that I know are important

00:02:55.072 --> 00:02:57.048
and lay the code out for everyone to see.

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:00.389
So where I started was with connection.

00:03:00.413 --> 00:03:03.825
Because, by the time
you're a social worker for 10 years,

00:03:03.849 --> 00:03:08.556
what you realize is that connection
is why we're here.

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:10.960
It's what gives purpose
and meaning to our lives.

00:03:11.816 --> 00:03:13.602
This is what it's all about.

00:03:13.626 --> 00:03:15.723
It doesn't matter whether
you talk to people

00:03:15.747 --> 00:03:18.839
who work in social justice,
mental health and abuse and neglect,

00:03:18.863 --> 00:03:24.204
what we know is that connection,
the ability to feel connected, is --

00:03:24.688 --> 00:03:26.706
neurobiologically
that's how we're wired --

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:28.109
it's why we're here.

00:03:28.133 --> 00:03:31.146
So I thought, you know what,
I'm going to start with connection.

00:03:31.807 --> 00:03:33.704
Well, you know that situation

00:03:33.728 --> 00:03:36.236
where you get an evaluation
from your boss,

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:39.046
and she tells you 37 things
that you do really awesome,

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:41.444
and one "opportunity for growth?"

00:03:41.468 --> 00:03:43.277
(Laughter)

00:03:43.936 --> 00:03:47.404
And all you can think about
is that opportunity for growth, right?

00:03:47.428 --> 00:03:50.126
Well, apparently this is the way
my work went as well,

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:55.127
because, when you ask people about love,
they tell you about heartbreak.

00:03:55.151 --> 00:03:57.785
When you ask people about belonging,

00:03:57.809 --> 00:04:01.761
they'll tell you their most excruciating
experiences of being excluded.

00:04:01.785 --> 00:04:04.286
And when you ask people about connection,

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:06.848
the stories they told me
were about disconnection.

00:04:07.858 --> 00:04:10.883
So very quickly -- really about six weeks
into this research --

00:04:10.907 --> 00:04:16.929
I ran into this unnamed thing
that absolutely unraveled connection

00:04:16.953 --> 00:04:19.413
in a way that I didn't understand
or had never seen.

00:04:19.849 --> 00:04:21.826
And so I pulled back out of the research

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:24.080
and thought, I need
to figure out what this is.

00:04:24.104 --> 00:04:26.283
And it turned out to be shame.

00:04:27.952 --> 00:04:31.230
And shame is really easily understood
as the fear of disconnection:

00:04:31.953 --> 00:04:36.509
Is there something about me that,
if other people know it or see it,

00:04:36.533 --> 00:04:39.699
that I won't be worthy of connection?

00:04:40.333 --> 00:04:42.015
The things I can tell you about it:

00:04:42.039 --> 00:04:43.706
It's universal; we all have it.

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:45.730
The only people who don't experience shame

00:04:45.754 --> 00:04:48.088
have no capacity for human
empathy or connection.

00:04:48.112 --> 00:04:49.706
No one wants to talk about it,

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:52.301
and the less you talk about it,
the more you have it.

00:04:53.745 --> 00:04:58.911
What underpinned this shame,
this "I'm not good enough," --

00:04:58.935 --> 00:05:00.539
which, we all know that feeling:

00:05:00.563 --> 00:05:02.612
"I'm not blank enough.
I'm not thin enough,

00:05:02.636 --> 00:05:05.890
rich enough, beautiful enough,
smart enough, promoted enough."

00:05:05.914 --> 00:05:10.890
The thing that underpinned this
was excruciating vulnerability.

00:05:11.602 --> 00:05:15.706
This idea of, in order
for connection to happen,

00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:19.476
we have to allow ourselves
to be seen, really seen.

00:05:20.801 --> 00:05:23.999
And you know how I feel
about vulnerability. I hate vulnerability.

00:05:24.023 --> 00:05:28.521
And so I thought, this is my chance
to beat it back with my measuring stick.

00:05:28.545 --> 00:05:31.236
I'm going in, I'm going
to figure this stuff out,

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:34.570
I'm going to spend a year,
I'm going to totally deconstruct shame,

00:05:34.594 --> 00:05:36.872
I'm going to understand
how vulnerability works,

00:05:36.896 --> 00:05:38.331
and I'm going to outsmart it.

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:41.650
So I was ready, and I was really excited.

00:05:44.979 --> 00:05:47.122
As you know,
it's not going to turn out well.

00:05:47.146 --> 00:05:49.659
(Laughter)

00:05:49.683 --> 00:05:51.277
You know this.

00:05:51.301 --> 00:05:53.190
So, I could tell you a lot about shame,

00:05:53.214 --> 00:05:55.311
but I'd have to borrow
everyone else's time.

00:05:55.335 --> 00:05:58.192
But here's what I can tell you
that it boils down to --

00:05:58.216 --> 00:06:01.598
and this may be one of the most important
things that I've ever learned

00:06:01.622 --> 00:06:03.486
in the decade of doing this research.

00:06:04.808 --> 00:06:09.000
My one year turned into six years:

00:06:09.024 --> 00:06:13.706
Thousands of stories, hundreds
of long interviews, focus groups.

00:06:13.730 --> 00:06:16.111
At one point, people were
sending me journal pages

00:06:16.135 --> 00:06:17.972
and sending me their stories --

00:06:17.996 --> 00:06:21.988
thousands of pieces of data in six years.

00:06:22.012 --> 00:06:23.706
And I kind of got a handle on it.

00:06:23.730 --> 00:06:26.829
I kind of understood, this is
what shame is, this is how it works.

00:06:28.192 --> 00:06:34.439
I wrote a book, I published a theory,
but something was not okay --

00:06:34.463 --> 00:06:38.619
and what it was is that, if I roughly
took the people I interviewed

00:06:38.643 --> 00:06:45.215
and divided them into people who really
have a sense of worthiness --

00:06:45.239 --> 00:06:48.001
that's what this comes down to,
a sense of worthiness --

00:06:48.025 --> 00:06:51.247
they have a strong sense
of love and belonging --

00:06:51.271 --> 00:06:52.922
and folks who struggle for it,

00:06:52.946 --> 00:06:56.046
and folks who are always wondering
if they're good enough.

00:06:56.070 --> 00:06:58.309
There was only one variable that separated

00:06:58.333 --> 00:07:01.073
the people who have a strong sense
of love and belonging

00:07:01.097 --> 00:07:03.356
and the people who really struggle for it.

00:07:03.380 --> 00:07:07.098
And that was, the people who have
a strong sense of love and belonging

00:07:07.122 --> 00:07:09.526
believe they're worthy
of love and belonging.

00:07:10.444 --> 00:07:11.594
That's it.

00:07:12.245 --> 00:07:13.733
They believe they're worthy.

00:07:15.476 --> 00:07:21.294
And to me, the hard part of the one thing
that keeps us out of connection

00:07:21.318 --> 00:07:24.533
is our fear that we're not
worthy of connection,

00:07:24.557 --> 00:07:26.960
was something that,
personally and professionally,

00:07:26.984 --> 00:07:29.206
I felt like I needed to understand better.

00:07:29.547 --> 00:07:34.524
So what I did is I took
all of the interviews

00:07:34.548 --> 00:07:37.366
where I saw worthiness,
where I saw people living that way,

00:07:37.390 --> 00:07:39.278
and just looked at those.

00:07:40.054 --> 00:07:42.102
What do these people have in common?

00:07:42.126 --> 00:07:46.769
I have a slight office supply addiction,
but that's another talk.

00:07:46.793 --> 00:07:50.270
So I had a manila folder,
and I had a Sharpie,

00:07:50.294 --> 00:07:52.914
and I was like, what am I going
to call this research?

00:07:52.938 --> 00:07:55.928
And the first words that came
to my mind were "whole-hearted."

00:07:56.547 --> 00:08:00.063
These are whole-hearted people,
living from this deep sense of worthiness.

00:08:00.087 --> 00:08:02.943
So I wrote at the top
of the manila folder,

00:08:02.967 --> 00:08:04.896
and I started looking at the data.

00:08:04.920 --> 00:08:10.913
In fact, I did it first in a four-day,
very intensive data analysis,

00:08:10.937 --> 00:08:14.514
where I went back, pulled the interviews,
the stories, pulled the incidents.

00:08:14.538 --> 00:08:16.317
What's the theme? What's the pattern?

00:08:17.110 --> 00:08:20.087
My husband left town with the kids

00:08:20.111 --> 00:08:23.088
because I always go into this
Jackson Pollock crazy thing,

00:08:23.112 --> 00:08:26.857
where I'm just writing
and in my researcher mode.

00:08:28.365 --> 00:08:29.912
And so here's what I found.

00:08:32.854 --> 00:08:35.706
What they had in common
was a sense of courage.

00:08:36.364 --> 00:08:39.461
And I want to separate courage
and bravery for you for a minute.

00:08:39.485 --> 00:08:41.926
Courage, the original
definition of courage,

00:08:41.950 --> 00:08:44.189
when it first came
into the English language --

00:08:44.213 --> 00:08:46.566
it's from the Latin word "cor,"
meaning "heart" --

00:08:46.590 --> 00:08:49.601
and the original definition was to tell
the story of who you are

00:08:49.625 --> 00:08:51.039
with your whole heart.

00:08:51.799 --> 00:08:55.973
And so these folks had, very simply,
the courage to be imperfect.

00:08:58.372 --> 00:09:03.349
They had the compassion to be kind
to themselves first and then to others,

00:09:03.373 --> 00:09:04.572
because, as it turns out,

00:09:04.596 --> 00:09:06.830
we can't practice compassion
with other people

00:09:06.854 --> 00:09:08.597
if we can't treat ourselves kindly.

00:09:08.999 --> 00:09:13.396
And the last was they had connection,
and -- this was the hard part --

00:09:13.420 --> 00:09:16.397
as a result of authenticity,

00:09:16.421 --> 00:09:19.706
they were willing to let go
of who they thought they should be

00:09:19.730 --> 00:09:24.334
in order to be who they were,
which you have to absolutely do that

00:09:24.358 --> 00:09:25.531
for connection.

00:09:28.063 --> 00:09:32.063
The other thing that they had
in common was this:

00:09:35.650 --> 00:09:38.730
They fully embraced vulnerability.

00:09:40.419 --> 00:09:47.070
They believed that what made them
vulnerable made them beautiful.

00:09:50.881 --> 00:09:54.706
They didn't talk about vulnerability
being comfortable,

00:09:54.730 --> 00:09:57.556
nor did they really talk
about it being excruciating --

00:09:57.580 --> 00:10:00.058
as I had heard it earlier
in the shame interviewing.

00:10:00.082 --> 00:10:02.312
They just talked about it being necessary.

00:10:03.373 --> 00:10:07.349
They talked about the willingness
to say, "I love you" first ...

00:10:09.118 --> 00:10:14.491
the willingness to do something
where there are no guarantees ...

00:10:16.023 --> 00:10:20.358
the willingness to breathe
through waiting for the doctor to call

00:10:20.382 --> 00:10:21.665
after your mammogram.

00:10:23.371 --> 00:10:26.636
They're willing to invest
in a relationship

00:10:26.660 --> 00:10:28.110
that may or may not work out.

00:10:29.205 --> 00:10:31.075
They thought this was fundamental.

00:10:32.182 --> 00:10:34.801
I personally thought it was betrayal.

00:10:35.587 --> 00:10:40.183
I could not believe I had pledged
allegiance to research, where our job --

00:10:40.207 --> 00:10:44.271
you know, the definition of research
is to control and predict,

00:10:44.295 --> 00:10:48.938
to study phenomena for the explicit
reason to control and predict.

00:10:48.962 --> 00:10:53.328
And now my mission to control and predict

00:10:53.352 --> 00:10:56.921
had turned up the answer
that the way to live is with vulnerability

00:10:56.945 --> 00:10:59.043
and to stop controlling and predicting.

00:10:59.067 --> 00:11:00.844
This led to a little breakdown --

00:11:01.642 --> 00:11:06.706
(Laughter)

00:11:06.730 --> 00:11:09.706
-- which actually looked more like this.

00:11:09.730 --> 00:11:11.223
(Laughter)

00:11:11.247 --> 00:11:13.224
And it did.

00:11:13.248 --> 00:11:16.428
I call it a breakdown; my therapist
calls it a spiritual awakening.

00:11:16.452 --> 00:11:17.686
(Laughter)

00:11:17.710 --> 00:11:20.127
A spiritual awakening
sounds better than breakdown,

00:11:20.151 --> 00:11:21.928
but I assure you, it was a breakdown.

00:11:21.952 --> 00:11:24.856
And I had to put my data away
and go find a therapist.

00:11:24.880 --> 00:11:27.111
Let me tell you something:
you know who you are

00:11:27.135 --> 00:11:30.375
when you call your friends and say,
"I think I need to see somebody.

00:11:30.399 --> 00:11:32.205
Do you have any recommendations?"

00:11:32.229 --> 00:11:34.278
Because about five
of my friends were like,

00:11:34.302 --> 00:11:36.446
"Wooo, I wouldn't want
to be your therapist."

00:11:36.470 --> 00:11:39.208
(Laughter)

00:11:39.232 --> 00:11:41.209
I was like, "What does that mean?"

00:11:41.233 --> 00:11:44.440
And they're like,
"I'm just saying, you know.

00:11:44.464 --> 00:11:46.441
Don't bring your measuring stick."

00:11:46.465 --> 00:11:49.201
(Laughter)

00:11:49.225 --> 00:11:50.425
I was like, "Okay."

00:11:51.285 --> 00:11:53.119
So I found a therapist.

00:11:53.143 --> 00:11:55.046
My first meeting with her, Diana --

00:11:56.849 --> 00:12:01.143
I brought in my list of the way
the whole-hearted live, and I sat down.

00:12:01.167 --> 00:12:02.976
And she said, "How are you?"

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:06.595
And I said, "I'm great. I'm okay."

00:12:06.619 --> 00:12:08.143
She said, "What's going on?"

00:12:08.167 --> 00:12:10.786
And this is a therapist
who sees therapists,

00:12:10.810 --> 00:12:16.023
because we have to go to those,
because their B.S. meters are good.

00:12:16.047 --> 00:12:18.023
(Laughter)

00:12:18.476 --> 00:12:22.309
And so I said, "Here's the thing,
I'm struggling."

00:12:22.333 --> 00:12:24.143
And she said, "What's the struggle?"

00:12:25.182 --> 00:12:27.443
And I said, "Well, I have
a vulnerability issue.

00:12:27.467 --> 00:12:32.822
And I know that vulnerability
is the core of shame and fear

00:12:32.846 --> 00:12:34.443
and our struggle for worthiness,

00:12:34.467 --> 00:12:40.143
but it appears that it's also
the birthplace of joy, of creativity,

00:12:40.167 --> 00:12:42.143
of belonging, of love.

00:12:42.516 --> 00:12:47.952
And I think I have a problem,
and I need some help."

00:12:47.976 --> 00:12:53.143
And I said, "But here's the thing:
no family stuff, no childhood shit."

00:12:53.167 --> 00:12:55.143
(Laughter)

00:12:55.167 --> 00:12:58.143
"I just need some strategies."

00:12:58.167 --> 00:13:02.143
(Laughter)

00:13:02.167 --> 00:13:05.752
(Applause)

00:13:05.776 --> 00:13:07.338
Thank you.

00:13:09.023 --> 00:13:10.500
So she goes like this.

00:13:12.167 --> 00:13:14.523
(Laughter)

00:13:14.547 --> 00:13:17.143
And then I said, "It's bad, right?"

00:13:17.167 --> 00:13:20.143
And she said, "It's neither good nor bad."

00:13:20.167 --> 00:13:22.000
(Laughter)

00:13:22.024 --> 00:13:23.658
"It just is what it is."

00:13:24.404 --> 00:13:27.143
And I said, "Oh my God,
this is going to suck."

00:13:27.167 --> 00:13:29.119
(Laughter)

00:13:30.333 --> 00:13:32.587
And it did, and it didn't.

00:13:32.611 --> 00:13:34.674
And it took about a year.

00:13:34.698 --> 00:13:36.714
And you know how there are people

00:13:36.738 --> 00:13:40.762
that, when they realize that vulnerability
and tenderness are important,

00:13:40.786 --> 00:13:42.817
that they surrender and walk into it.

00:13:43.971 --> 00:13:45.931
A: that's not me,

00:13:45.955 --> 00:13:48.352
and B: I don't even hang out
with people like that.

00:13:48.376 --> 00:13:51.143
(Laughter)

00:13:51.167 --> 00:13:53.254
For me, it was a yearlong street fight.

00:13:54.492 --> 00:13:55.666
It was a slugfest.

00:13:56.079 --> 00:13:57.913
Vulnerability pushed, I pushed back.

00:13:58.333 --> 00:14:01.420
I lost the fight,

00:14:01.444 --> 00:14:03.143
but probably won my life back.

00:14:03.467 --> 00:14:05.443
And so then I went back into the research

00:14:05.467 --> 00:14:07.143
and spent the next couple of years

00:14:07.167 --> 00:14:10.143
really trying to understand
what they, the whole-hearted,

00:14:10.167 --> 00:14:16.143
what choices they were making,
and what we are doing with vulnerability.

00:14:16.167 --> 00:14:18.507
Why do we struggle with it so much?

00:14:18.531 --> 00:14:20.692
Am I alone in struggling
with vulnerability?

00:14:21.930 --> 00:14:23.143
No.

00:14:23.167 --> 00:14:24.628
So this is what I learned.

00:14:26.699 --> 00:14:28.366
We numb vulnerability --

00:14:29.420 --> 00:14:31.007
when we're waiting for the call.

00:14:31.031 --> 00:14:33.920
It was funny, I sent something out
on Twitter and on Facebook

00:14:33.944 --> 00:14:36.218
that says, "How would you
define vulnerability?

00:14:36.242 --> 00:14:37.790
What makes you feel vulnerable?"

00:14:37.814 --> 00:14:40.538
And within an hour and a half,
I had 150 responses.

00:14:40.562 --> 00:14:43.535
Because I wanted to know what's out there.

00:14:45.944 --> 00:14:50.967
Having to ask my husband for help
because I'm sick, and we're newly married;

00:14:50.991 --> 00:14:52.998
initiating sex with my husband;

00:14:53.022 --> 00:14:55.736
initiating sex with my wife;

00:14:55.760 --> 00:14:58.738
being turned down; asking someone out;

00:14:58.762 --> 00:15:00.801
waiting for the doctor to call back;

00:15:00.825 --> 00:15:03.167
getting laid off; laying off people.

00:15:03.191 --> 00:15:04.595
This is the world we live in.

00:15:05.702 --> 00:15:08.670
We live in a vulnerable world.

00:15:08.694 --> 00:15:11.630
And one of the ways we deal
with it is we numb vulnerability.

00:15:12.428 --> 00:15:14.143
And I think there's evidence --

00:15:14.167 --> 00:15:16.548
and it's not the only reason
this evidence exists,

00:15:16.572 --> 00:15:18.681
but I think it's a huge cause --

00:15:18.705 --> 00:15:21.594
We are the most in-debt ...

00:15:23.278 --> 00:15:24.500
obese ...

00:15:25.650 --> 00:15:29.809
addicted and medicated
adult cohort in U.S. history.

00:15:33.055 --> 00:15:36.325
The problem is -- and I learned this
from the research --

00:15:36.349 --> 00:15:39.492
that you cannot selectively numb emotion.

00:15:40.031 --> 00:15:42.364
You can't say, here's the bad stuff.

00:15:43.167 --> 00:15:45.543
Here's vulnerability,
here's grief, here's shame,

00:15:45.567 --> 00:15:47.243
here's fear, here's disappointment.

00:15:47.267 --> 00:15:49.143
I don't want to feel these.

00:15:49.167 --> 00:15:52.049
I'm going to have a couple of beers
and a banana nut muffin.

00:15:52.073 --> 00:15:54.759
(Laughter)

00:15:54.783 --> 00:15:56.652
I don't want to feel these.

00:15:56.676 --> 00:15:58.652
And I know that's knowing laughter.

00:15:58.676 --> 00:16:01.143
I hack into your lives for a living.

00:16:01.167 --> 00:16:03.143
God.

00:16:03.167 --> 00:16:05.714
(Laughter)

00:16:05.738 --> 00:16:08.496
You can't numb those hard feelings

00:16:08.520 --> 00:16:11.154
without numbing
the other affects, our emotions.

00:16:11.178 --> 00:16:12.630
You cannot selectively numb.

00:16:12.654 --> 00:16:15.261
So when we numb those,

00:16:15.285 --> 00:16:17.808
we numb joy,

00:16:17.832 --> 00:16:19.143
we numb gratitude,

00:16:19.167 --> 00:16:20.467
we numb happiness.

00:16:21.888 --> 00:16:25.011
And then, we are miserable,

00:16:25.035 --> 00:16:27.044
and we are looking
for purpose and meaning,

00:16:27.068 --> 00:16:28.500
and then we feel vulnerable,

00:16:28.524 --> 00:16:31.332
so then we have a couple of beers
and a banana nut muffin.

00:16:31.356 --> 00:16:34.722
And it becomes this dangerous cycle.

00:16:35.827 --> 00:16:38.960
One of the things that I think
we need to think about

00:16:38.984 --> 00:16:40.960
is why and how we numb.

00:16:41.668 --> 00:16:43.748
And it doesn't just have to be addiction.

00:16:45.217 --> 00:16:48.590
The other thing we do is we make
everything that's uncertain certain.

00:16:50.167 --> 00:16:55.253
Religion has gone from a belief
in faith and mystery to certainty.

00:16:55.277 --> 00:16:56.959
"I'm right, you're wrong. Shut up."

00:16:58.927 --> 00:17:00.143
That's it.

00:17:01.351 --> 00:17:02.621
Just certain.

00:17:03.080 --> 00:17:05.496
The more afraid we are,
the more vulnerable we are,

00:17:05.520 --> 00:17:06.905
the more afraid we are.

00:17:06.929 --> 00:17:08.936
This is what politics looks like today.

00:17:08.960 --> 00:17:10.635
There's no discourse anymore.

00:17:10.659 --> 00:17:12.143
There's no conversation.

00:17:12.547 --> 00:17:13.771
There's just blame.

00:17:13.795 --> 00:17:16.112
You know how blame
is described in the research?

00:17:17.293 --> 00:17:19.792
A way to discharge pain and discomfort.

00:17:22.356 --> 00:17:23.546
We perfect.

00:17:23.570 --> 00:17:27.348
If there's anyone who wants their life
to look like this, it would be me,

00:17:27.372 --> 00:17:28.599
but it doesn't work.

00:17:28.623 --> 00:17:32.243
Because what we do is we take fat
from our butts and put it in our cheeks.

00:17:32.267 --> 00:17:35.706
(Laughter)

00:17:35.730 --> 00:17:39.143
Which just, I hope in 100 years,
people will look back and go, "Wow."

00:17:39.167 --> 00:17:41.690
(Laughter)

00:17:41.714 --> 00:17:45.143
And we perfect,
most dangerously, our children.

00:17:45.167 --> 00:17:47.310
Let me tell you what we think
about children.

00:17:47.334 --> 00:17:50.143
They're hardwired for struggle
when they get here.

00:17:50.167 --> 00:17:53.049
And when you hold those perfect
little babies in your hand,

00:17:53.073 --> 00:17:56.031
our job is not to say,
"Look at her, she's perfect.

00:17:56.055 --> 00:17:57.951
My job is just to keep her perfect --

00:17:57.975 --> 00:18:01.382
make sure she makes the tennis team
by fifth grade and Yale by seventh."

00:18:01.406 --> 00:18:02.643
That's not our job.

00:18:02.667 --> 00:18:04.276
Our job is to look and say,

00:18:04.300 --> 00:18:07.316
"You know what? You're imperfect,
and you're wired for struggle,

00:18:07.340 --> 00:18:09.340
but you are worthy of love and belonging."

00:18:10.241 --> 00:18:11.428
That's our job.

00:18:11.844 --> 00:18:14.074
Show me a generation
of kids raised like that,

00:18:14.098 --> 00:18:16.699
and we'll end the problems,
I think, that we see today.

00:18:16.723 --> 00:18:22.175
We pretend that what we do
doesn't have an effect on people.

00:18:23.611 --> 00:18:25.245
We do that in our personal lives.

00:18:25.269 --> 00:18:26.492
We do that corporate --

00:18:26.516 --> 00:18:28.626
whether it's a bailout, an oil spill ...

00:18:30.126 --> 00:18:31.286
a recall.

00:18:31.310 --> 00:18:33.287
We pretend like what we're doing

00:18:33.311 --> 00:18:35.397
doesn't have a huge impact
on other people.

00:18:36.167 --> 00:18:39.441
I would say to companies,
this is not our first rodeo, people.

00:18:40.509 --> 00:18:43.176
We just need you to be authentic
and real and say ...

00:18:44.659 --> 00:18:46.803
"We're sorry. We'll fix it."

00:18:50.275 --> 00:18:53.047
But there's another way,
and I'll leave you with this.

00:18:53.071 --> 00:18:54.452
This is what I have found:

00:18:54.476 --> 00:18:58.999
To let ourselves be seen,
deeply seen, vulnerably seen ...

00:19:01.631 --> 00:19:06.020
to love with our whole hearts,
even though there's no guarantee --

00:19:06.044 --> 00:19:07.298
and that's really hard,

00:19:07.322 --> 00:19:10.663
and I can tell you as a parent,
that's excruciatingly difficult --

00:19:13.235 --> 00:19:17.417
to practice gratitude and joy
in those moments of terror,

00:19:17.441 --> 00:19:19.754
when we're wondering,
"Can I love you this much?

00:19:19.778 --> 00:19:21.964
Can I believe in this this passionately?

00:19:21.988 --> 00:19:23.918
Can I be this fierce about this?"

00:19:23.942 --> 00:19:27.519
just to be able to stop and, instead of
catastrophizing what might happen,

00:19:27.543 --> 00:19:29.520
to say, "I'm just so grateful,

00:19:29.544 --> 00:19:31.944
because to feel this vulnerable
means I'm alive."

00:19:33.488 --> 00:19:37.150
And the last, which I think
is probably the most important,

00:19:37.174 --> 00:19:38.824
is to believe that we're enough.

00:19:39.404 --> 00:19:43.253
Because when we work from a place,
I believe, that says, "I'm enough" ...

00:19:45.483 --> 00:19:49.451
then we stop screaming
and start listening,

00:19:49.475 --> 00:19:51.802
we're kinder and gentler
to the people around us,

00:19:51.826 --> 00:19:53.975
and we're kinder and gentler to ourselves.

00:19:54.865 --> 00:19:56.343
That's all I have. Thank you.

00:19:56.367 --> 00:19:58.960
