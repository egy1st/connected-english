WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
The first thing I want to do is say thank you to all of you.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
The second thing I want to do is introduce my co-author

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
and dear friend and co-teacher.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Ken and I have been working together

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
for almost 40 years.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
That's Ken Sharpe over there.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
(Applause)

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
So there is among many people --

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
certainly me and most of the people I talk to --

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
a kind of collective dissatisfaction

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
with the way things are working,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
with the way our institutions run.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Our kids' teachers seem to be failing them.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Our doctors don't know who the hell we are,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
and they don't have enough time for us.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
We certainly can't trust the bankers,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
and we certainly can't trust the brokers.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
They almost brought the entire financial system down.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
And even as we do our own work,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
all too often,

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
we find ourselves having to choose

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
between doing what we think is the right thing

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
and doing the expected thing,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
or the required thing,

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
or the profitable thing.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
So everywhere we look,

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
pretty much across the board,

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
we worry that the people we depend on

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
don't really have our interests at heart.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
Or if they do have our interests at heart,

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
we worry that they don't know us well enough

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
to figure out what they need to do

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
in order to allow us

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
to secure those interests.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
They don't understand us.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
They don't have the time to get to know us.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
There are two kinds of responses

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
that we make

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
to this sort of general dissatisfaction.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
If things aren't going right,

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
the first response is:

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
let's make more rules,

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
let's set up a set

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
of detailed procedures

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
to make sure that people will do the right thing.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
Give teachers scripts

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
to follow in the classroom,

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
so even if they don't know what they're doing

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000
and don't care about the welfare of our kids,

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
as long as they follow the scripts,

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
our kids will get educated.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
Give judges a list of mandatory sentences

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
to impose for crimes,

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
so that you don't need to rely

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
on judges using their judgment.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
Instead, all they have to do

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
is look up on the list

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000
what kind of sentence goes with what kind of crime.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
Impose limits

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000
on what credit card companies can charge in interest

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
and on what they can charge in fees.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
More and more rules

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
to protect us

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
against an indifferent, uncaring

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
set of institutions we have to deal with.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
Or -- or maybe and --

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000
in addition to rules,

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
let's see if we can come up

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
with some really clever incentives

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
so that, even if the people we deal with

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000
don't particularly want to serve our interests,

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
it is in their interest

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
to serve our interest --

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
the magic incentives

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
that will get people to do the right thing

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
even out of pure selfishness.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
So we offer teachers bonuses

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
if the kids they teach

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000
score passing grades on these big test scores

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
that are used to evaluate

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
the quality of school systems.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
Rules and incentives --

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
"sticks" and "carrots."

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000
We passed a bunch of rules

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000
to regulate the financial industry

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000
in response to the recent collapse.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
There's the Dodd-Frank Act,

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000
there's the new Consumer Financial Protection Agency

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
that is temporarily being headed through the backdoor

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
by Elizabeth Warren.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000
Maybe these rules

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.000
will actually improve

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.000
the way these financial services companies behave.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000
We'll see.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000
In addition, we are struggling

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000
to find some way to create incentives

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.000
for people in the financial services industry

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000
that will have them more interested

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000
in serving the long-term interests

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000
even of their own companies,

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
rather than securing short-term profits.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000
So if we find just the right incentives,

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000
they'll do the right thing -- as I said -- selfishly,

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000
and if we come up with the right rules and regulations,

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000
they won't drive us all over a cliff.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000
And Ken [Sharpe] and I certainly know

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000
that you need to reign in the bankers.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.000
If there is a lesson to be learned from the financial collapse

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000
it is that.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.000
But what we believe,

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000
and what we argue in the book,

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000
is that there is no set of rules,

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
no matter how detailed,

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000
no matter how specific,

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000
no matter how carefully monitored

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000
and enforced,

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000
there is no set of rules

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000
that will get us what we need.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.000
Why? Because bankers are smart people.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000
And, like water,

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000
they will find cracks

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.000
in any set of rules.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.000
You design a set of rules that will make sure

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000
that the particular reason

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000
why the financial system "almost-collapse"

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000
can't happen again.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000
It is naive beyond description

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000
to think that having blocked

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000
this source of financial collapse,

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.000
you have blocked all possible sources of financial collapse.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.000
So it's just a question of waiting for the next one

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.000
and then marveling at how we could have been so stupid

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.000
as not to protect ourselves against that.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000
What we desperately need,

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.000
beyond, or along with, better rules

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000
and reasonably smart incentives,

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000
is we need virtue.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000
We need character.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.000
We need people who want to do the right thing.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000
And in particular,

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.000
the virtue that we need most of all

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000
is the virtue that Aristotle called

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.000
"practical wisdom."

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000
Practical wisdom

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.000
is the moral will

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000
to do the right thing

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000
and the moral skill

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.000
to figure out what the right thing is.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.000
So Aristotle was very interested in watching

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.000
how the craftsmen around him worked.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.000
And he was impressed

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.000
at how they would improvise

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000
novel solutions to novel problems --

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000
problems that they hadn't anticipated.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000
So one example is he sees these stonemasons

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.000
working on the Isle of Lesbos,

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000
and they need to measure out

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.000
round columns.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.000
Well if you think about it,

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.000
it's really hard to measure out round columns using a ruler.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000
So what do they do?

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.000
They fashion a novel solution to the problem.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.000
They created a ruler that bends,

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.000
what we would call these days a tape measure --

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.000
a flexible rule,

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000
a rule that bends.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.000
And Aristotle said,

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.000
"Hah, they appreciated that sometimes

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.000
to design rounded columns,

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.000
you need to bend the rule."

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.000
And Aristotle said

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:55.000
often in dealing with other people,

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.000
we need to bend the rules.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000
Dealing with other people

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.000
demands a kind of flexibility

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.000
that no set of rules can encompass.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.000
Wise people know when and how

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.000
to bend the rules.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.000
Wise people know how to improvise.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:16.000
The way my co-author , Ken, and I talk about it,

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.000
they are kind of like jazz musicians.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.000
The rules are like the notes on the page,

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.000
and that gets you started,

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:25.000
but then you dance around the notes on the page,

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.000
coming up with just the right combination

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000
for this particular moment

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:32.000
with this particular set of fellow players.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.000
So for Aristotle,

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:37.000
the kind

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:40.000
of rule-bending,

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.000
rule exception-finding and improvisation

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.000
that you see in skilled craftsmen

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.000
is exactly what you need

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:50.000
to be a skilled moral craftsman.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000
And in interactions with people,

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000
almost all the time,

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.000
it is this kind of flexibility that is required.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:59.000
A wise person knows when to bend the rules.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.000
A wise person knows when to improvise.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.000
And most important,

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.000
a wise person does this improvising and rule-bending

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:09.000
in the service of the right aims.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:13.000
If you are a rule-bender and an improviser

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.000
mostly to serve yourself,

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.000
what you get is ruthless manipulation of other people.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.000
So it matters that you do this wise practice

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.000
in the service of others

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.000
and not in the service of yourself.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.000
And so the will to do the right thing

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.000
is just as important as the moral skill

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000
of improvisation

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.000
and exception-finding.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.000
Together they comprise practical wisdom,

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.000
which Aristotle thought

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.000
was the master virtue.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000
So I'll give you an example

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.000
of wise practice in action.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:47.000
It's the case of Michael.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.000
Michael's a young guy.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000
He had a pretty low-wage job.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:54.000
He was supporting his wife and a child,

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.000
and the child was going to parochial school.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:59.000
Then he lost his job.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.000
He panicked

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:04.000
about being able to support his family.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:07.000
One night, he drank a little too much,

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.000
and he robbed a cab driver --

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.000
stole 50 dollars.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.000
He robbed him at gunpoint.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:16.000
It was a toy gun.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:19.000
He got caught. He got tried.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.000
He got convicted.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:24.000
The Pennsylvania sentencing guidelines

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:27.000
required a minimum sentence for a crime like this

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.000
of two years, 24 months.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:32.000
The judge on the case, Judge Lois Forer

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:35.000
thought that this made no sense.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:38.000
He had never committed a crime before.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:41.000
He was a responsible husband and father.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.000
He had been faced with desperate circumstances.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:46.000
All this would do is wreck a family.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:49.000
And so she improvised a sentence -- 11 months,

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.000
and not only that,

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.000
but release every day to go to work.

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:56.000
Spend your night in jail, spend your day holding down a job.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:59.000
He did. He served out his sentence.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.000
He made restitution

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.000
and found himself a new job.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:06.000
And the family was united.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.000
And it seemed on the road

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:11.000
to some sort of a decent life --

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:14.000
a happy ending to a story

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.000
involving wise improvisation

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:19.000
from a wise judge.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:22.000
But it turned out

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:25.000
the prosecutor was not happy

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:28.000
that Judge Forer ignored the sentencing guidelines

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.000
and sort of invented her own,

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:33.000
and so he appealed.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:36.000
And he asked for the mandatory minimum sentence

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.000
for armed robbery.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:41.000
He did after all have a toy gun.

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.000
The mandatory minimum sentence for armed robbery

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:46.000
is five years.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.000
He won the appeal.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:51.000
Michael was sentenced to five years in prison.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:55.000
Judge Forer had to follow the law.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.000
And by the way, this appeal went through

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.000
after he had finished serving his sentence,

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:03.000
so he was out and working at a job

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:05.000
and taking care of his family

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:07.000
and he had to go back into jail.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:10.000
Judge Forer did what she was required to do,

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:13.000
and then she quit the bench.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:17.000
And Michael disappeared.

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.000
So that is an example,

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.000
both of wisdom in practice

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.000
and the subversion of wisdom

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:27.000
by rules that are meant, of course, to make things better.

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.000
Now consider Ms. Dewey.

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:32.000
Ms. Dewey's a teacher in a Texas elementary school.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:35.000
She found herself listening to a consultant one day

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:37.000
who was trying to help teachers

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.000
boost the test scores of the kids,

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.000
so that the school

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:44.000
would reach the elite category

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:46.000
in percentage of kids passing big tests.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.000
All these schools in Texas compete with one another

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.000
to achieve these milestones,

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:53.000
and there are bonuses and various other treats

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:56.000
that come if you beat the other schools.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:59.000
So here was the consultant's advice:

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:02.000
first, don't waste your time on kids

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:05.000
who are going to pass the test no matter what you do.

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.000
Second, don't waste your time

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:11.000
on kids who can't pass the test

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.000
no matter what you do.

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:15.000
Third, don't waste your time

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:18.000
on kids who moved into the district

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:21.000
too late for their scores to be counted.

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:24.000
Focus all of your time and attention

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:27.000
on the kids who are on the bubble,

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:29.000
the so-called "bubble kids" --

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:31.000
kids where your intervention

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:33.000
can get them just maybe over the line

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:35.000
from failing to passing.

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:37.000
So Ms. Dewey heard this,

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:40.000
and she shook her head in despair

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:43.000
while fellow teachers were sort of cheering each other on

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:45.000
and nodding approvingly.

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:47.000
It's like they were about to go play a football game.

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:49.000
For Ms. Dewey,

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:52.000
this isn't why she became a teacher.

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.000
Now Ken and I are not naive,

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:57.000
and we understand that you need to have rules.

00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:59.000
You need to have incentives.

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.000
People have to make a living.

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:03.000
But the problem

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:05.000
with relying on rules and incentives

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:08.000
is that they demoralize

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:10.000
professional activity,

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.000
and they demoralize professional activity

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.000
in two senses.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.000
First, they demoralize the people

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.000
who are engaged in the activity.

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:20.000
Judge Forer quits,

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.000
and Ms. Dewey in completely disheartened.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.000
And second,

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.000
they demoralize the activity itself.

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:29.000
The very practice is demoralized,

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:31.000
and the practitioners are demoralized.

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.000
It creates people --

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:36.000
when you manipulate incentives to get people to do the right thing --

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.000
it creates people

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.000
who are addicted to incentives.

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:42.000
That is to say, it creates people

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.000
who only do things for incentives.

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:46.000
Now the striking thing about this

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.000
is that psychologists have known this

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.000
for 30 years.

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.000
Psychologists have known

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:55.000
about the negative consequences of incentivizing everything

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.000
for 30 years.

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:00.000
We know that if you reward kids for drawing pictures,

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.000
they stop caring about the drawing

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.000
and care only about the reward.

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:06.000
If you reward kids for reading books,

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:09.000
they stop caring about what's in the books

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:11.000
and only care about how long they are.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:14.000
If you reward teachers for kids' test scores,

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.000
they stop caring about educating

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.000
and only care about test preparation.

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:20.000
If you were to reward doctors

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:22.000
for doing more procedures --

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:24.000
which is the current system -- they would do more.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:27.000
If instead you reward doctors for doing fewer procedures,

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:29.000
they will do fewer.

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:31.000
What we want, of course,

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:33.000
is doctors who do just the right amount of procedures

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:36.000
and do the right amount for the right reason --

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:39.000
namely, to serve the welfare of their patients.

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:41.000
Psychologists have known this for decades,

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:44.000
and it's time for policymakers

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.000
to start paying attention

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:49.000
and listen to psychologists a little bit,

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:52.000
instead of economists.

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:54.000
And it doesn't have to be this way.

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:57.000
We think, Ken and I, that there are real sources of hope.

00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:59.000
We identify one set of people

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:01.000
in all of these practices

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.000
who we call canny outlaws.

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:05.000
These are people

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:08.000
who, being forced to operate

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:10.000
in a system that demands rule-following

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:12.000
and creates incentives,

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:14.000
find away around the rules,

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:17.000
find a way to subvert the rules.

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:19.000
So there are teachers who have these scripts to follow,

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:22.000
and they know that if they follow these scripts, the kids will learn nothing.

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:25.000
And so what they do is they follow the scripts,

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:28.000
but they follow the scripts at double-time

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:31.000
and squirrel away little bits of extra time

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:33.000
during which they teach in the way

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:36.000
that they actually know is effective.

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:39.000
So these are little ordinary, everyday heroes,

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:41.000
and they're incredibly admirable,

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:44.000
but there's no way that they can sustain this kind of activity

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:46.000
in the face of a system

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:48.000
that either roots them out

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:50.000
or grinds them down.

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:52.000
So canny outlaws are better than nothing,

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:54.000
but it's hard to imagine any canny outlaw

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:57.000
sustaining that for an indefinite period of time.

00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:59.000
More hopeful

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:01.000
are people we call system-changers.

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:03.000
These are people who are looking

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:06.000
not to dodge the system's rules and regulations,

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:08.000
but to transform the system,

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:10.000
and we talk about several.

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:12.000
One in particular

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:15.000
is a judge named Robert Russell.

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:17.000
And one day he was faced

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:20.000
with the case of Gary Pettengill.

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:23.000
Pettengill was a 23-year-old vet

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:25.000
who had planned to make the army a career,

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:27.000
but then he got a severe back injury in Iraq,

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:30.000
and that forced him to take a medical discharge.

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:33.000
He was married, he had a third kid on the way,

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:36.000
he suffered from PTSD, in addition to the bad back,

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:38.000
and recurrent nightmares,

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:40.000
and he had started using marijuana

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:43.000
to ease some of the symptoms.

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:46.000
He was only able to get part-time work because of his back,

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:49.000
and so he was unable to earn enough to put food on the table

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:51.000
and take care of his family.

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:53.000
So he started selling marijuana.

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:56.000
He was busted in a drug sweep.

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:58.000
His family was kicked out of their apartment,

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:00.000
and the welfare system

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:02.000
was threatening to take away his kids.

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:04.000
Under normal sentencing procedures,

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:07.000
Judge Russell would have had little choice

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:09.000
but to sentence Pettengill to serious jail-time

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:12.000
as a drug felon.

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:15.000
But Judge Russell did have an alternative.

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:18.000
And that's because he was in a special court.

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:21.000
He was in a court called the Veterans' Court.

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:23.000
In the Veterans' Court --

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:26.000
this was the first of its kind in the United States.

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:28.000
Judge Russell created the Veterans' Court.

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:30.000
It was a court only for veterans

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:33.000
who had broken the law.

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:35.000
And he had created it exactly because

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:37.000
mandatory sentencing laws

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:40.000
were taking the judgment out of judging.

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:43.000
No one wanted non-violent offenders --

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:46.000
and especially non-violent offenders who were veterans to boot --

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:48.000
to be thrown into prison.

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:51.000
They wanted to do something about what we all know,

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:54.000
namely the revolving door of the criminal justice system.

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:56.000
And what the Veterans' Court did,

00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:59.000
was it treated each criminal as an individual,

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:02.000
tried to get inside their problems,

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:05.000
tried to fashion responses to their crimes

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:07.000
that helped them to rehabilitate themselves,

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:10.000
and didn't forget about them once the judgment was made.

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:13.000
Stayed with them, followed up on them,

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:15.000
made sure that they were sticking to whatever plan

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:17.000
had been jointly developed

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:19.000
to get them over the hump.

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:21.000
There are now 22 cities

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:23.000
that have Veterans' Courts like this.

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:26.000
Why has the idea spread?

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:28.000
Well, one reason is

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:30.000
that Judge Russell

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:32.000
has now seen 108 vets

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:34.000
in his Veterans' Court

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:36.000
as of February of this year,

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:38.000
and out of 108,

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:40.000
guess how many have gone back through

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:42.000
the revolving door of justice

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:44.000
into prison.

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:46.000
None. None.

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:49.000
Anyone would glom onto

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:51.000
a criminal justice system

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:53.000
that has this kind of a record.

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:56.000
So here's is a system-changer, and it seems to be catching.

00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:58.000
There's a banker

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:00.000
who created a for-profit community bank

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:03.000
that encouraged bankers -- I know this is hard to believe --

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:06.000
encouraged bankers who worked there to do well

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:09.000
by doing good for their low-income clients.

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:12.000
The bank helped finance the rebuilding

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:15.000
of what was otherwise a dying community.

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:18.000
Though their loan recipients were high-risk by ordinary standards,

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:21.000
the default rate was extremely low.

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:24.000
The bank was profitable.

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:26.000
The bankers stayed with their loan recipients.

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:28.000
They didn't make loans and then sell the loans.

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:30.000
They serviced the loans.

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:32.000
They made sure that their loan recipients

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:35.000
were staying up with their payments.

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:38.000
Banking hasn't always been

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:42.000
the way we read about it now in the newspapers.

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:44.000
Even Goldman Sachs

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:47.000
once used to serve clients,

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:50.000
before it turned into an institution

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:52.000
that serves only itself.

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:54.000
Banking wasn't always this way,

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:57.000
and it doesn't have to be this way.

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:02.000
So there are examples like this in medicine --

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:04.000
doctors at Harvard

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:06.000
who are trying to transform medical education,

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:08.000
so that you don't get a kind of ethical erosion

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:10.000
and loss of empathy,

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:12.000
which characterizes most medical students

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:14.000
in the course of their medical training.

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:17.000
And the way they do it is to give third-year medical students

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:19.000
patients who they follow for an entire year.

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:21.000
So the patients are not organ systems,

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:23.000
and they're not diseases;

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:25.000
they're people, people with lives.

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:27.000
And in order to be an effective doctor,

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:30.000
you need to treat people who have lives and not just disease.

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:33.000
In addition to which there's an enormous amount of back and forth,

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:35.000
mentoring of one student by another,

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:38.000
of all the students by the doctors,

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:41.000
and the result is a generation -- we hope -- of doctors

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:43.000
who do have time for the people they treat.

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:45.000
We'll see.

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:48.000
So there are lots of examples like this that we talk about.

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:50.000
Each of them shows that it is possible

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:53.000
to build on and nurture character

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:55.000
and keep a profession

00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:57.000
true to its proper mission --

00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:00.000
what Aristotle would have called its proper telos.

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:03.000
And Ken and I believe

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:06.000
that this is what practitioners actually want.

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:08.000
People want to be allowed

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:10.000
to be virtuous.

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:13.000
They want to have permission to do the right thing.

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:15.000
They don't want to feel

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:17.000
like they need to take a shower

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:20.000
to get the moral grime off their bodies everyday

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:23.000
when they come home from work.

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:25.000
Aristotle thought that practical wisdom

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:27.000
was the key to happiness,

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:30.000
and he was right.

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:33.000
There's now a lot of research being done in psychology

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:35.000
on what makes people happy,

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:38.000
and the two things that jump out in study after study --

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:40.000
I know this will come as a shock to all of you --

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:43.000
the two things that matter most to happiness

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:46.000
are love and work.

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:49.000
Love: managing successfully

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:51.000
relations with the people who are close to you

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:54.000
and with the communities of which you are a part.

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:57.000
Work: engaging in activities

00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:00.000
that are meaningful and satisfying.

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:03.000
If you have that, good close relations with other people,

00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:06.000
work that's meaningful and fulfilling,

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:09.000
you don't much need anything else.

00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:12.000
Well, to love well and to work well,

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:14.000
you need wisdom.

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:16.000
Rules and incentives don't tell you

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:19.000
how to be a good friend, how to be a good parent,

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:21.000
how to be a good spouse,

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:23.000
or how to be a good doctor or a good lawyer

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:25.000
or a good teacher.

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:27.000
Rules and incentives

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:29.000
are no substitutes for wisdom.

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:31.000
Indeed, we argue,

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:34.000
there is no substitute for wisdom.

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:36.000
And so practical wisdom

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:38.000
does not require

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:41.000
heroic acts of self-sacrifice

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:44.000
on the part of practitioners.

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:46.000
In giving us the will and the skill

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:49.000
to do the right thing -- to do right by others --

00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:51.000
practical wisdom also gives us

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:53.000
the will and the skill

00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:56.000
to do right by ourselves.

00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:58.000
Thanks.

00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:01.000
(Applause)
