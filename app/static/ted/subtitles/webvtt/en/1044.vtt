00:00:00.507 --> 00:00:04.398
My big idea is a very, very small idea

00:00:04.422 --> 00:00:09.175
that can unlock billions of big ideas

00:00:09.199 --> 00:00:12.565
that are at the moment dormant inside us.

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:16.003
And my little idea
that will do that is sleep.

00:00:16.437 --> 00:00:17.976
(Laughter)

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.213
(Applause)

00:00:22.237 --> 00:00:25.000
This is a room of type A women.

00:00:26.769 --> 00:00:29.858
This is a room of sleep-deprived women.

00:00:31.731 --> 00:00:35.126
And I learned the hard way
the value of sleep.

00:00:35.944 --> 00:00:39.054
Two-and-a-half years ago,
I fainted from exhaustion.

00:00:39.078 --> 00:00:40.864
I hit my head on my desk.

00:00:40.888 --> 00:00:44.588
I broke my cheekbone,
I got five stitches on my right eye.

00:00:45.103 --> 00:00:49.469
And I began the journey
of rediscovering the value of sleep.

00:00:50.961 --> 00:00:53.867
And in the course of that, I studied,

00:00:53.891 --> 00:00:56.469
I met with medical doctors, scientists,

00:00:56.493 --> 00:00:58.372
and I'm here to tell you

00:00:58.396 --> 00:01:03.932
that the way to a more productive,
more inspired, more joyful life

00:01:03.956 --> 00:01:05.702
is getting enough sleep.

00:01:06.396 --> 00:01:11.588
(Applause)

00:01:11.612 --> 00:01:14.178
And we women are going to lead the way

00:01:14.202 --> 00:01:17.606
in this new revolution,
this new feminist issue.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.884
We are literally going to sleep
our way to the top -- literally --

00:01:21.908 --> 00:01:23.369
(Laughter)

00:01:23.393 --> 00:01:28.744
(Applause)

00:01:28.768 --> 00:01:32.079
because unfortunately, for men,

00:01:32.103 --> 00:01:35.172
sleep deprivation has become
a virility symbol.

00:01:36.211 --> 00:01:38.401
I was recently having dinner with a guy

00:01:38.425 --> 00:01:42.541
who bragged that he had only gotten
four hours sleep the night before.

00:01:42.922 --> 00:01:45.495
And I felt like saying to him --
but I didn't say --

00:01:45.519 --> 00:01:48.646
I felt like saying, "You know what?
if you had gotten five,

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:51.219
this dinner would have been
a lot more interesting."

00:01:51.243 --> 00:01:55.203
(Laughter)

00:01:55.227 --> 00:01:58.719
There is now a kind
of sleep deprivation one-upmanship.

00:01:59.301 --> 00:02:02.449
Especially here in Washington,
if you try to make a breakfast date,

00:02:02.473 --> 00:02:04.346
and you say, "How about eight o'clock?"

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:07.333
they're likely to tell you,
"Eight o'clock is too late for me,

00:02:07.357 --> 00:02:09.422
but that's OK, I can get
a game of tennis in

00:02:09.446 --> 00:02:11.957
and do a few conference calls
and meet you at eight."

00:02:11.981 --> 00:02:16.804
And they think that means they are
so incredibly busy and productive,

00:02:16.828 --> 00:02:18.475
but the truth is, they're not,

00:02:19.374 --> 00:02:20.976
because we, at the moment,

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:26.861
have had brilliant leaders
in business, in finance, in politics,

00:02:26.885 --> 00:02:28.706
making terrible decisions.

00:02:29.865 --> 00:02:34.227
So a high IQ does not mean
that you're a good leader,

00:02:34.251 --> 00:02:38.475
because the essence of leadership
is being able to see the iceberg

00:02:38.499 --> 00:02:40.355
before it hits the Titanic.

00:02:40.379 --> 00:02:42.122
(Laughter)

00:02:42.146 --> 00:02:46.079
And we've had far too many icebergs
hitting our Titanics.

00:02:46.441 --> 00:02:48.643
In fact, I have a feeling

00:02:48.667 --> 00:02:52.128
that if Lehman Brothers
was Lehman Brothers and Sisters,

00:02:52.152 --> 00:02:53.613
they might still be around.

00:02:53.637 --> 00:02:55.065
(Laughter)

00:02:55.089 --> 00:02:57.166
(Applause)

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:02.751
While all the brothers were busy
just being hyper-connected 24/7,

00:03:02.775 --> 00:03:05.112
maybe a sister would have
noticed the iceberg,

00:03:05.136 --> 00:03:06.675
because she would have woken up

00:03:06.699 --> 00:03:09.580
from a seven-and-a-half-
or eight-hour sleep,

00:03:09.699 --> 00:03:12.415
and have been able to see the big picture.

00:03:13.637 --> 00:03:17.815
So as we are facing
all the multiple crises

00:03:17.839 --> 00:03:20.244
in our world at the moment,

00:03:20.268 --> 00:03:23.085
what is good for us on a personal level,

00:03:23.109 --> 00:03:28.646
what's going to bring more joy,
gratitude, effectiveness in our lives

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:31.150
and be the best for our own careers,

00:03:31.174 --> 00:03:33.685
is also what is best for the world.

00:03:34.484 --> 00:03:39.286
So I urge you to shut your eyes,

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:42.747
and discover the great ideas
that lie inside us;

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:46.690
to shut your engines
and discover the power of sleep.

00:03:46.714 --> 00:03:47.976
Thank you.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.460
(Applause)
