00:00:01.119 --> 00:00:04.548
You may have heard
about the Koran's idea of paradise

00:00:04.572 --> 00:00:06.851
being 72 virgins,

00:00:06.875 --> 00:00:09.828
and I promise I will come back
to those virgins.

00:00:09.852 --> 00:00:12.806
But in fact, here in the Northwest,
we're living very close

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:15.433
to the real Koranic idea of paradise,

00:00:15.457 --> 00:00:21.102
defined 36 times as "gardens
watered by running streams."

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.137
Since I live on a houseboat
on the running stream of Lake Union,

00:00:26.161 --> 00:00:28.383
this makes perfect sense to me.

00:00:28.407 --> 00:00:31.407
But the thing is, how come
it's news to most people?

00:00:32.707 --> 00:00:34.876
I know many well-intentioned non-Muslims

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:37.567
who've begun reading
the Koran, but given up,

00:00:37.591 --> 00:00:40.120
disconcerted by its "otherness."

00:00:40.912 --> 00:00:43.640
The historian Thomas Carlyle
considered Muhammad

00:00:43.664 --> 00:00:45.640
one of the world's greatest heroes,

00:00:45.664 --> 00:00:48.076
yet even he called the Koran

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:53.466
"as toilsome reading as I ever undertook;
a wearisome, confused jumble."

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:55.766
(Laughter)

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:58.796
Part of the problem,
I think, is that we imagine

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:02.476
that the Koran can be read
as we usually read a book --

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:05.476
as though we can curl up
with it on a rainy afternoon

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:07.476
with a bowl of popcorn within reach,

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.020
as though God --

00:01:09.044 --> 00:01:12.786
and the Koran is entirely in the voice
of God speaking to Muhammad --

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.604
were just another author
on the best-seller list.

00:01:17.675 --> 00:01:21.728
Yet, the fact that so few people
do actually read the Koran

00:01:21.752 --> 00:01:27.014
is precisely why it's so easy to quote --
that is, to misquote.

00:01:27.038 --> 00:01:28.062
(Laughter)

00:01:28.086 --> 00:01:30.476
Phrases and snippets taken out of context

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:32.576
in what I call the "highlighter version,"

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:35.687
which is the one favored
by both Muslim fundamentalists

00:01:35.711 --> 00:01:38.476
and anti-Muslim Islamophobes.

00:01:38.996 --> 00:01:40.822
So this past spring,

00:01:40.846 --> 00:01:44.908
as I was gearing up to begin writing
a biography of Muhammad,

00:01:44.932 --> 00:01:49.166
I realized I needed to read
the Koran properly --

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:51.952
as properly as I could, that is.

00:01:51.976 --> 00:01:55.086
My Arabic is reduced by now
to wielding a dictionary,

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.476
so I took four well-known translations

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:01.665
and decided to read them
side by side, verse by verse,

00:02:01.689 --> 00:02:06.558
along with a transliteration
and the original seventh-century Arabic.

00:02:08.812 --> 00:02:11.500
Now, I did have an advantage.

00:02:12.483 --> 00:02:17.151
My last book was about the story
behind the Shi'a-Sunni split,

00:02:17.175 --> 00:02:20.588
and for that, I'd worked closely
with the earliest Islamic histories,

00:02:20.612 --> 00:02:24.374
so I knew the events
to which the Koran constantly refers,

00:02:24.398 --> 00:02:26.375
its frame of reference.

00:02:26.399 --> 00:02:31.476
I knew enough, that is, to know
that I'd be a tourist in the Koran --

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.476
an informed one,

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:34.975
an experienced one, even,

00:02:34.999 --> 00:02:37.348
but still an outsider,

00:02:37.372 --> 00:02:41.194
an agnostic Jew reading
someone else's holy book.

00:02:41.218 --> 00:02:43.293
(Laughter)

00:02:43.317 --> 00:02:44.887
So I read slowly.

00:02:44.911 --> 00:02:49.396
(Laughter)

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:51.907
I'd set aside three weeks
for this project,

00:02:51.931 --> 00:02:54.801
and that, I think,
is what is meant by "hubris" --

00:02:54.825 --> 00:02:59.111
(Laughter)

00:02:59.135 --> 00:03:01.311
because it turned out to be three months.

00:03:01.335 --> 00:03:03.222
(Laughter)

00:03:03.246 --> 00:03:05.744
I did resist the temptation
to skip to the back,

00:03:05.768 --> 00:03:08.935
where the shorter and more
clearly mystical chapters are.

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:12.476
But every time I thought I was beginning
to get a handle on the Koran --

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:14.782
that feeling of "I get it now" --

00:03:14.806 --> 00:03:16.869
it would slip away overnight,

00:03:16.893 --> 00:03:18.547
and I'd come back in the morning,

00:03:18.571 --> 00:03:21.299
wondering if I wasn't lost
in a strange land.

00:03:22.038 --> 00:03:24.555
And yet, the terrain was very familiar.

00:03:25.317 --> 00:03:28.180
The Koran declares that it comes
to renew the message

00:03:28.204 --> 00:03:29.637
of the Torah and the Gospels.

00:03:29.661 --> 00:03:33.149
So one-third of it reprises
the stories of Biblical figures

00:03:33.173 --> 00:03:37.702
like Abraham, Moses, Joseph, Mary, Jesus.

00:03:38.741 --> 00:03:41.385
God himself was utterly familiar

00:03:41.409 --> 00:03:44.476
from his earlier manifestation as Yahweh,

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:47.500
jealously insisting on no other gods.

00:03:48.638 --> 00:03:53.702
The presence of camels, mountains,
desert wells and springs

00:03:53.726 --> 00:03:57.157
took me back to the year I spent
wandering the Sinai Desert.

00:03:57.926 --> 00:04:01.476
And then there was the language,
the rhythmic cadence of it,

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:04.721
reminding me of evenings spent
listening to Bedouin elders

00:04:04.745 --> 00:04:07.722
recite hours-long narrative poems

00:04:07.746 --> 00:04:09.613
entirely from memory.

00:04:10.827 --> 00:04:15.530
And I began to grasp why it's said

00:04:15.554 --> 00:04:19.666
that the Koran is really
the Koran only in Arabic.

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:24.427
Take the Fatihah,
the seven-verse opening chapter

00:04:24.451 --> 00:04:28.451
that is the Lord's Prayer
and the Shema Yisrael of Islam combined.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.037
It's just 29 words in Arabic,

00:04:32.061 --> 00:04:35.902
but anywhere from 65 to 72 in translation.

00:04:35.926 --> 00:04:39.693
And yet the more you add,
the more seems to go missing.

00:04:40.867 --> 00:04:45.476
The Arabic has an incantatory,
almost hypnotic quality

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:48.758
that begs to be heard rather than read,

00:04:48.782 --> 00:04:50.552
felt more than analyzed.

00:04:51.245 --> 00:04:53.304
It wants to be chanted out loud,

00:04:53.328 --> 00:04:56.112
to sound its music in the ear
and on the tongue.

00:04:56.755 --> 00:05:01.476
So the Koran in English
is a kind of shadow of itself,

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:04.331
or as Arthur Arberry called his version,

00:05:04.355 --> 00:05:05.703
"an interpretation."

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:10.046
But all is not lost in translation.

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:13.476
As the Koran promises,
patience is rewarded,

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:15.049
and there are many surprises --

00:05:15.073 --> 00:05:18.229
a degree of environmental
awareness, for instance,

00:05:18.253 --> 00:05:21.822
and of humans as mere stewards
of God's creation,

00:05:21.846 --> 00:05:23.480
unmatched in the Bible.

00:05:24.349 --> 00:05:27.226
And where the Bible is addressed
exclusively to men,

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:29.876
using the second-
and third-person masculine,

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:32.476
the Koran includes women --

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:33.924
talking, for instance,

00:05:33.948 --> 00:05:36.372
of believing men and believing women,

00:05:36.396 --> 00:05:39.584
honorable men and honorable women.

00:05:40.984 --> 00:05:44.961
Or take the infamous verse
about killing the unbelievers.

00:05:45.851 --> 00:05:47.476
Yes, it does say that,

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:50.226
but in a very specific context:

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:54.587
the anticipated conquest
of the sanctuary city of Mecca,

00:05:54.611 --> 00:05:57.135
where fighting was usually forbidden.

00:05:57.159 --> 00:06:00.682
And the permission comes
hedged about with qualifiers.

00:06:00.706 --> 00:06:03.476
Not "You must kill unbelievers in Mecca,"

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:05.739
but you can, you are allowed to,

00:06:05.763 --> 00:06:10.134
but only after a grace period is over,

00:06:10.158 --> 00:06:13.016
and only if there's no other
pact in place,

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:16.476
and only if they try to stop
you getting to the Kaaba,

00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:19.216
and only if they attack you first.

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:22.845
And even then -- God is merciful;

00:06:22.869 --> 00:06:24.898
forgiveness is supreme --

00:06:24.922 --> 00:06:27.640
and so, essentially,

00:06:27.664 --> 00:06:29.117
better if you don't.

00:06:29.141 --> 00:06:32.583
(Laughter)

00:06:32.607 --> 00:06:35.370
This was perhaps the biggest surprise --

00:06:35.394 --> 00:06:37.476
how flexible the Koran is,

00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:41.185
at least in minds that are not
fundamentally inflexible.

00:06:42.396 --> 00:06:46.043
"Some of these verses
are definite in meaning," it says,

00:06:46.067 --> 00:06:47.936
"and others are ambiguous."

00:06:48.881 --> 00:06:52.683
The perverse at heart
will seek out the ambiguities,

00:06:52.707 --> 00:06:57.336
trying to create discord
by pinning down meanings of their own.

00:06:57.360 --> 00:06:59.650
Only God knows the true meaning.

00:07:01.031 --> 00:07:04.993
The phrase "God is subtle"
appears again and again,

00:07:05.017 --> 00:07:07.619
and indeed, the whole
of the Koran is far more subtle

00:07:07.643 --> 00:07:10.147
than most of us have been led to believe.

00:07:10.171 --> 00:07:15.239
As in, for instance, that little matter
of virgins and paradise.

00:07:16.444 --> 00:07:19.615
Old-fashioned orientalism
comes into play here.

00:07:20.591 --> 00:07:25.169
The word used four times is "houris,"

00:07:25.193 --> 00:07:29.650
rendered as dark-eyed maidens
with swelling breasts,

00:07:29.674 --> 00:07:32.867
or as fair, high-bosomed virgins.

00:07:33.939 --> 00:07:38.500
Yet all there is in the original Arabic
is that one word: houris.

00:07:39.245 --> 00:07:41.749
Not a swelling breast
or high bosom in sight.

00:07:41.773 --> 00:07:44.277
(Laughter)

00:07:44.301 --> 00:07:48.858
Now this may be a way of saying
"pure beings," like in angels,

00:07:48.882 --> 00:07:51.895
or it may be like
the Greek "kouros" or "kore,"

00:07:51.919 --> 00:07:53.261
an eternal youth.

00:07:53.285 --> 00:07:56.021
But the truth is, nobody really knows.

00:07:56.045 --> 00:07:57.289
And that's the point.

00:07:58.206 --> 00:08:00.622
Because the Koran is quite clear

00:08:00.646 --> 00:08:05.476
when it says that you'll be
"a new creation in paradise,"

00:08:05.500 --> 00:08:10.629
and that you will be "recreated
in a form unknown to you,"

00:08:10.653 --> 00:08:13.188
which seems to me
a far more appealing prospect

00:08:13.212 --> 00:08:14.791
than a virgin.

00:08:14.815 --> 00:08:21.787
(Laughter)

00:08:22.992 --> 00:08:26.303
And that number 72 never appears.

00:08:26.327 --> 00:08:29.993
There are no 72 virgins in the Koran.

00:08:30.017 --> 00:08:33.262
That idea only came
into being 300 years later,

00:08:33.286 --> 00:08:36.263
and most Islamic scholars
see it as the equivalent

00:08:36.287 --> 00:08:39.889
of people with wings sitting on clouds
and strumming harps.

00:08:41.333 --> 00:08:43.978
Paradise is quite the opposite.

00:08:44.851 --> 00:08:46.614
It's not virginity;

00:08:46.638 --> 00:08:48.122
it's fecundity;

00:08:48.733 --> 00:08:50.204
it's plenty.

00:08:50.847 --> 00:08:54.605
It's gardens watered by running streams.

00:08:56.260 --> 00:08:57.412
Thank you.

00:08:57.436 --> 00:09:04.413
(Applause)
