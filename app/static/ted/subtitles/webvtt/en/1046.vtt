WEBVTT

00:00:00.785 --> 00:00:03.258
So I am a surgeon who studies creativity,

00:00:03.282 --> 00:00:06.110
and I have never had a patient tell me,

00:00:06.134 --> 00:00:08.976
"I really want you
to be creative during surgery,"

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.119
and so I guess
there's a little bit of irony to it.

00:00:12.143 --> 00:00:15.443
I will say though that,
after having done surgery a lot,

00:00:15.467 --> 00:00:17.677
it's similar to playing
a musical instrument.

00:00:17.701 --> 00:00:20.531
And for me, this deep
and enduring fascination with sound

00:00:20.555 --> 00:00:22.297
is what led me to both be a surgeon

00:00:22.321 --> 00:00:24.855
and to study the science
of sound, particularly music.

00:00:24.879 --> 00:00:26.928
I'm going to talk
over the next few minutes

00:00:26.952 --> 00:00:28.243
about my career

00:00:28.267 --> 00:00:30.551
in terms of how I'm able to study music

00:00:30.575 --> 00:00:32.609
and try to grapple
with all these questions

00:00:32.633 --> 00:00:34.976
of how the brain is able to be creative.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.630
I've done most of this work
at Johns Hopkins University,

00:00:37.654 --> 00:00:40.639
and at the National Institute
of Health where I was previously.

00:00:40.663 --> 00:00:44.170
I'll go over some science experiments
and cover three musical experiments.

00:00:44.194 --> 00:00:46.250
I will start off by playing
a video for you.

00:00:46.274 --> 00:00:49.377
This video is of Keith Jarrett,
who's a well-known jazz improviser

00:00:49.401 --> 00:00:51.845
and probably the most
well-known, iconic example

00:00:51.869 --> 00:00:54.362
of someone who takes improvisation
to a higher level.

00:00:54.386 --> 00:00:57.525
And he'll improvise entire concerts
off the top of his head,

00:00:57.549 --> 00:00:59.954
and he'll never play it
exactly the same way again,

00:00:59.978 --> 00:01:01.963
so as a form of intense creativity,

00:01:01.987 --> 00:01:03.605
I think this is a great example.

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:05.976
And so why don't we go
and click the video.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.000
(Music)

00:02:01.795 --> 00:02:03.796
(Music ends)

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:06.159
It's really a remarkable
thing that happens there.

00:02:06.183 --> 00:02:07.911
I've always as a listener, as a fan,

00:02:07.935 --> 00:02:09.652
I listen to that, and I'm astounded.

00:02:09.676 --> 00:02:11.412
I think -- how can this possibly be?

00:02:11.436 --> 00:02:13.727
How can the brain generate
that much information,

00:02:13.751 --> 00:02:15.336
that much music, spontaneously?

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.976
And so I set out
with this concept, scientifically,

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.351
that artistic creativity,
it's magical, but it's not magic,

00:02:22.375 --> 00:02:24.382
meaning that it's a product of the brain.

00:02:24.406 --> 00:02:26.840
There's not too many brain-dead
people creating art.

00:02:26.864 --> 00:02:30.495
With this notion that artistic creativity
is in fact a neurologic product,

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:32.976
I took this thesis that we could study it

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.114
just like we study any other
complex neurologic process,

00:02:36.138 --> 00:02:38.193
and there are subquestions
that I put there.

00:02:38.217 --> 00:02:40.603
Is it possible to study
creativity scientifically?

00:02:40.627 --> 00:02:42.664
And I think that's a good question.

00:02:42.688 --> 00:02:45.374
And I'll tell you that most
scientific studies of music,

00:02:45.398 --> 00:02:46.916
they're very dense,

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:48.335
and when you go through them,

00:02:48.359 --> 00:02:50.429
it's very hard to recognize
the music in it.

00:02:50.453 --> 00:02:52.672
In fact, they seem to be
unmusical entirely

00:02:52.696 --> 00:02:54.490
and to miss the point of the music.

00:02:54.514 --> 00:02:56.070
This brings the second question:

00:02:56.094 --> 00:02:57.976
Why should scientists study creativity?

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.079
Maybe we're not the right people to do it.

00:03:00.103 --> 00:03:01.102
(Laughter)

00:03:01.126 --> 00:03:04.578
Well it may be, but I will say that,
from a scientific perspective,

00:03:04.602 --> 00:03:06.620
we talked a lot about innovation today,

00:03:06.644 --> 00:03:07.976
the science of innovation,

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.953
how much we understand
about how the brain is able to innovate

00:03:10.977 --> 00:03:12.221
is in its infancy,

00:03:12.245 --> 00:03:15.712
and truly, we know very little
about how we are able to be creative.

00:03:15.736 --> 00:03:17.260
I think that we're going to see,

00:03:17.284 --> 00:03:18.976
over the next 10, 20, 30 years,

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.171
a real science of creativity
that's burgeoning

00:03:21.195 --> 00:03:22.396
and is going to flourish,

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:24.852
Because we now have new methods
that can enable us

00:03:24.876 --> 00:03:27.400
to take this process
like complex jazz improvisation,

00:03:27.424 --> 00:03:28.798
and study it rigorously.

00:03:28.822 --> 00:03:30.969
So it gets down to the brain.

00:03:30.993 --> 00:03:32.787
All of us have this remarkable brain,

00:03:32.811 --> 00:03:35.266
which is poorly understood,
to say the least.

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:39.488
I think that neuroscientists
have more questions than answers,

00:03:39.512 --> 00:03:41.714
and I'm not going
to give you answers today,

00:03:41.738 --> 00:03:43.099
just ask a lot of questions.

00:03:43.123 --> 00:03:44.630
And that's what I do in my lab.

00:03:44.654 --> 00:03:47.968
I ask questions about what is the brain
doing to enable us to do this.

00:03:47.992 --> 00:03:50.769
This is the main method that I use.
This is functional MRI.

00:03:50.793 --> 00:03:53.516
If you've been in an MRI scanner,
it's very much the same,

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:57.455
but this one is outfitted in a special way
to not just take pictures of your brain,

00:03:57.479 --> 00:04:00.406
but to also take pictures
of active areas of the brain.

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:02.335
The way that's done is by the following:

00:04:02.359 --> 00:04:04.169
There's something called BOLD imaging,

00:04:04.193 --> 00:04:06.592
which is Blood Oxygen
Level Dependent imaging.

00:04:07.281 --> 00:04:09.866
When you're in an fMRI scanner,
you're in a big magnet

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:12.263
that's aligning your molecules
in certain areas.

00:04:12.287 --> 00:04:16.006
When an area of the brain is active,
meaning a neural area is active,

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:18.268
it gets blood flow shunted to that area.

00:04:18.292 --> 00:04:22.642
That blood flow causes an increase
in local blood to that area

00:04:22.666 --> 00:04:25.649
with a deoxyhemoglobin
change in concentration.

00:04:25.673 --> 00:04:27.828
Deoxyhemoglobin can be detected by MRI,

00:04:27.852 --> 00:04:29.702
whereas oxyhemoglobin can't.

00:04:29.726 --> 00:04:31.680
So through this method of inference --

00:04:31.704 --> 00:04:34.246
and we're measuring blood flow,
not neural activity --

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:37.006
we say that an area of the brain
that's getting more blood

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:40.572
was active during a particular task,
and that's the crux of how fMRI works.

00:04:40.596 --> 00:04:44.501
And it's been used since the '90s
to study really complex processes.

00:04:44.525 --> 00:04:48.025
I'm going to review a study that I did,
which was jazz in an fMRI scanner.

00:04:48.049 --> 00:04:50.552
It was done with a colleague,
Alan Braun, at the NIH.

00:04:50.576 --> 00:04:52.976
This is a short video
of how we did this project.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.781
(Video) Charles Limb: This is a plastic
MIDI piano keyboard

00:04:55.805 --> 00:04:57.586
that we use for the jazz experiments.

00:04:57.610 --> 00:04:59.663
And it's a 35-key keyboard

00:04:59.687 --> 00:05:02.147
designed to fit both inside the scanner,

00:05:02.171 --> 00:05:03.507
be magnetically safe,

00:05:03.531 --> 00:05:07.373
have minimal interference
that would contribute to any artifact,

00:05:07.397 --> 00:05:10.317
and have this cushion
so that it can rest on the players' legs

00:05:10.341 --> 00:05:13.296
while they're lying down in the scanner,
playing on their back.

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:16.349
It works like this --
this doesn't actually produce any sound.

00:05:16.373 --> 00:05:18.816
It sends out what's called
a MIDI signal --

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:20.889
or a Musical Instrument
Digital Interface --

00:05:20.913 --> 00:05:23.574
through these wires into the box
and then the computer,

00:05:23.598 --> 00:05:26.533
which then trigger
high-quality piano samples like this.

00:05:26.557 --> 00:05:29.798
(Music)

00:05:33.049 --> 00:05:36.803
(Music)

00:05:52.333 --> 00:05:54.308
(Music ends)

00:05:54.332 --> 00:05:55.976
OK, so it works.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:57.976
And so through this piano keyboard,

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.743
we have the means to take
a musical process and study it.

00:06:00.767 --> 00:06:03.694
So what do you do now that you have
this cool piano keyboard?

00:06:03.718 --> 00:06:06.163
You can't just say,
"It's great we have a keyboard."

00:06:06.187 --> 00:06:08.511
We have to come up
with a scientific experiment.

00:06:08.535 --> 00:06:10.658
The experiment
really rests on the following:

00:06:10.929 --> 00:06:14.573
What happens in the brain during something
that's memorized and over-learned,

00:06:14.597 --> 00:06:16.752
and what happens in the brain
during something

00:06:16.776 --> 00:06:19.050
that is spontaneously
generated, or improvised,

00:06:19.074 --> 00:06:20.888
in a way that's matched motorically

00:06:20.912 --> 00:06:23.757
and in terms of lower-level
sensory motor features?

00:06:23.781 --> 00:06:26.376
I have here what we call the paradigms.

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:29.896
There's a scale paradigm, which is playing
a scale up and down, memorized,

00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:31.654
then there's improvising on a scale,

00:06:31.678 --> 00:06:33.715
quarter notes, metronome, right hand --

00:06:33.739 --> 00:06:35.310
scientifically very safe,

00:06:35.334 --> 00:06:37.207
but musically really boring.

00:06:37.231 --> 00:06:40.202
Then there's the bottom one,
which is called the jazz paradigm.

00:06:40.226 --> 00:06:42.630
So we brought professional
jazz players to the NIH,

00:06:42.654 --> 00:06:45.607
and we had them memorize
this piece of music on the lower-left,

00:06:45.631 --> 00:06:47.449
which is what you heard me playing --

00:06:47.473 --> 00:06:49.966
and we had them improvise
to the same chord changes.

00:06:49.990 --> 00:06:52.198
And if you can hit
that lower-right sound icon,

00:06:52.222 --> 00:06:55.050
that's an example
of what was recorded in the scanner.

00:06:55.074 --> 00:06:58.804
(Music)

00:07:19.804 --> 00:07:21.805
(Music ends)

00:07:21.829 --> 00:07:24.245
In the end, it's not the most
natural environment,

00:07:24.269 --> 00:07:26.175
but they're able to play real music.

00:07:26.199 --> 00:07:28.170
And I've listened to that solo 200 times,

00:07:28.194 --> 00:07:29.371
and I still like it.

00:07:29.395 --> 00:07:31.782
And the musicians
were comfortable in the end.

00:07:31.806 --> 00:07:33.630
We first measured the number of notes.

00:07:33.654 --> 00:07:36.311
Were they playing more notes
when they were improvising?

00:07:36.335 --> 00:07:37.925
That was not what was going on.

00:07:37.949 --> 00:07:39.934
And then we looked at the brain activity.

00:07:39.958 --> 00:07:41.766
I will try to condense this for you.

00:07:41.790 --> 00:07:45.270
These are contrast maps that are showing
subtractions between what changes

00:07:45.294 --> 00:07:48.390
when you're improvising
vs. when you're doing something memorized.

00:07:48.414 --> 00:07:51.199
In red is an area that's active
in the prefrontal cortex,

00:07:51.223 --> 00:07:52.682
the frontal lobe of the brain,

00:07:52.706 --> 00:07:54.885
and in blue is this area
that was deactivated.

00:07:54.909 --> 00:07:57.785
So we had this focal area
called the medial prefrontal cortex

00:07:57.809 --> 00:07:59.196
that went way up in activity.

00:07:59.220 --> 00:08:02.450
We had this broad patch of area
called the lateral prefrontal cortex

00:08:02.474 --> 00:08:03.999
that went way down in activity,

00:08:04.023 --> 00:08:05.511
I'll summarize that for you.

00:08:05.535 --> 00:08:07.643
These are multifunctional
areas of the brain,

00:08:07.667 --> 00:08:09.822
these are not the jazz areas of the brain.

00:08:09.846 --> 00:08:11.774
They do a whole host of things

00:08:11.798 --> 00:08:13.657
that have to do with self-reflection,

00:08:13.681 --> 00:08:16.041
introspection, working memory etc.

00:08:16.065 --> 00:08:18.552
Really, consciousness is seated
in the frontal lobe.

00:08:18.576 --> 00:08:20.610
But we have this combination

00:08:20.634 --> 00:08:24.083
of an area that's thought to be involved
in self-monitoring, turning off,

00:08:24.107 --> 00:08:26.570
and this area that's thought
to be autobiographical,

00:08:26.594 --> 00:08:28.129
or self-expressive, turning on.

00:08:28.153 --> 00:08:30.224
We think, at least in this preliminary --

00:08:30.248 --> 00:08:33.001
it's one study; it's probably wrong,
but it's one study --

00:08:33.025 --> 00:08:34.064
(Laughter)

00:08:34.088 --> 00:08:36.819
we think that at least
a reasonable hypothesis

00:08:36.843 --> 00:08:38.004
is that, to be creative,

00:08:38.028 --> 00:08:40.904
you should have this weird dissociation
in your frontal lobe.

00:08:40.928 --> 00:08:43.452
One area turns on,
and a big area shuts off,

00:08:43.476 --> 00:08:46.414
so that you're not inhibited,
you're willing to make mistakes,

00:08:46.438 --> 00:08:48.606
so that you're not constantly
shutting down

00:08:48.630 --> 00:08:50.555
all of these new generative impulses.

00:08:50.579 --> 00:08:54.024
Now a lot of people know that music
is not always a solo activity --

00:08:54.048 --> 00:08:55.768
sometimes it's done communicatively.

00:08:55.792 --> 00:08:56.976
The next question was:

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.572
What happens when musicians
are trading back and forth,

00:08:59.596 --> 00:09:01.209
something called "trading fours,"

00:09:01.233 --> 00:09:04.056
which is something they do
normally in a jazz experiment.

00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:05.493
So this is a 12-bar blues,

00:09:05.517 --> 00:09:07.626
and I've broken it
down into four-bar groups,

00:09:07.650 --> 00:09:09.462
so you would know how you would trade.

00:09:09.486 --> 00:09:11.772
We brought a musician
into the scanner, same way,

00:09:11.796 --> 00:09:13.208
had them memorize this melody

00:09:13.232 --> 00:09:15.798
then had another musician
out in the control room

00:09:15.822 --> 00:09:17.791
trading back and forth interactively.

00:09:17.815 --> 00:09:20.439
So this is a musician, Mike Pope,

00:09:20.463 --> 00:09:23.549
one of the world's best bassists
and a fantastic piano player.

00:09:23.573 --> 00:09:29.832
(Music)

00:09:29.856 --> 00:09:32.222
He's now playing the piece
that we just saw

00:09:32.246 --> 00:09:33.976
a little better than I wrote it.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:35.766
(Video) CL: Mike, come on in.

00:09:35.790 --> 00:09:37.560
Mike Pope: May the force be with you.

00:09:37.584 --> 00:09:39.350
Nurse: Nothing in your pockets, Mike?

00:09:39.374 --> 00:09:40.917
MP: No. Nothing's in my pockets.

00:09:50.577 --> 00:09:53.355
CL: You have to have the right
attitude to agree to do it.

00:09:53.379 --> 00:09:54.635
(Laughter)

00:09:54.659 --> 00:09:56.474
It's kind of fun, actually.

00:09:56.498 --> 00:09:58.097
(Music)

00:09:58.121 --> 00:09:59.820
Now we're playing back and forth.

00:09:59.844 --> 00:10:02.056
He's in there.
You can see his legs up there.

00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:03.422
(Music)

00:10:03.446 --> 00:10:06.636
And then I'm in the control room here,
playing back and forth.

00:10:06.660 --> 00:10:13.660
(Music)

00:10:16.130 --> 00:10:17.280
(Music ends)

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:21.344
(Video) Mike Pope:
This is a pretty good representation

00:10:21.368 --> 00:10:23.152
of what it's like.

00:10:23.176 --> 00:10:25.176
And it's good that it's not too quick.

00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:27.779
The fact that we do it over and over again

00:10:27.803 --> 00:10:31.073
lets you acclimate to your surroundings.

00:10:32.033 --> 00:10:34.691
So the hardest thing for me
was the kinesthetic thing,

00:10:34.715 --> 00:10:37.976
looking at my hands through two mirrors,

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:39.976
laying on my back,

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.678
and not able to move at all
except for my hand.

00:10:42.702 --> 00:10:44.574
That was challenging.

00:10:44.598 --> 00:10:45.748
But again --

00:10:46.952 --> 00:10:49.738
there were moments, for sure --

00:10:49.762 --> 00:10:50.763
(Laughter)

00:10:50.787 --> 00:10:55.150
there were moments of real, honest-to-God
musical interplay, for sure.

00:10:55.786 --> 00:10:57.788
CL: At this point,
I'll take a few moments.

00:10:57.812 --> 00:10:59.693
So what you're seeing here --

00:10:59.717 --> 00:11:01.794
and I'm doing a cardinal sin in science,

00:11:01.818 --> 00:11:03.628
which is to show you preliminary data.

00:11:03.652 --> 00:11:05.405
This is one subject's data.

00:11:05.429 --> 00:11:07.176
This is, in fact, Mike Pope's data.

00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:08.676
So what am I showing you here?

00:11:08.700 --> 00:11:12.811
When he was trading fours with me,
improvising vs. memorized,

00:11:12.835 --> 00:11:15.584
his language areas lit up,
his Broca's area,

00:11:15.608 --> 00:11:17.670
in the inferior frontal gyrus on the left.

00:11:17.694 --> 00:11:19.603
He had it also homologous on the right.

00:11:19.627 --> 00:11:22.786
This is an area thought to be
involved in expressive communication.

00:11:22.810 --> 00:11:24.938
This whole notion
that music is a language --

00:11:24.962 --> 00:11:27.261
maybe there's a neurologic
basis to it after all,

00:11:27.285 --> 00:11:30.639
and we can see it when two musicians
are having a musical conversation.

00:11:30.663 --> 00:11:32.636
So we've done this on eight subjects now,

00:11:32.660 --> 00:11:34.589
and we're getting all the data together,

00:11:34.613 --> 00:11:37.438
hopefully we'll have something
to say about it meaningfully.

00:11:37.462 --> 00:11:40.705
Now when I think about improvisation
and the language, what's next?

00:11:40.729 --> 00:11:42.976
Rap, of course, rap -- freestyle.

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.747
I've always been fascinated by freestyle.

00:11:45.771 --> 00:11:47.284
And let's play this video.

00:11:47.308 --> 00:11:50.146
(Video) Mos Def: Brown skin I be,
standing five-ten I be

00:11:50.170 --> 00:11:52.192
Rockin' it when I be, in your vicinity

00:11:52.216 --> 00:11:55.236
Whole-style synergy, recognize symmetry

00:11:55.260 --> 00:11:57.594
Go and try to injure me,
broke 'em down chemically

00:11:57.618 --> 00:12:00.047
Ain't the number 10 MC,
talk about how been I be

00:12:00.071 --> 00:12:02.469
Styled it like Kennedy,
late like a 10 to three

00:12:02.493 --> 00:12:05.311
When I say when I be,
girls say bend that key cut

00:12:05.335 --> 00:12:07.153
CL: So there's a lot of analogy

00:12:07.177 --> 00:12:09.633
between what takes place
in freestyle rap and jazz.

00:12:09.657 --> 00:12:12.574
There are a lot of correlates
between the two forms of music,

00:12:12.598 --> 00:12:15.045
I think, in different time periods,
in lot of ways,

00:12:15.069 --> 00:12:17.900
rap serves the same social function
that jazz used to serve.

00:12:17.924 --> 00:12:19.817
So how do you study rap scientifically?

00:12:19.841 --> 00:12:22.976
And my colleagues think I'm crazy,
but I think it's very viable.

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:24.227
This is what you do:

00:12:24.251 --> 00:12:26.998
You have a freestyle artist come
and memorize a rap

00:12:27.022 --> 00:12:28.243
that you write for them,

00:12:28.267 --> 00:12:31.699
that they've never heard before,
and then you have them freestyle.

00:12:31.723 --> 00:12:34.141
So I told my lab members
that I would rap for TED,

00:12:34.165 --> 00:12:35.807
and they said, "No, you won't."

00:12:35.831 --> 00:12:37.034
And then I thought --

00:12:37.058 --> 00:12:38.374
(Laughter)

00:12:38.398 --> 00:12:44.124
(Applause)

00:12:44.148 --> 00:12:45.428
But here's the thing.

00:12:45.452 --> 00:12:48.353
With this big screen,
you can all rap with me. OK?

00:12:48.377 --> 00:12:50.221
So what we had them do

00:12:50.245 --> 00:12:52.841
was memorize this lower-left
sound icon, please.

00:12:52.865 --> 00:12:55.758
This is the control condition.
This is what they memorized.

All of these words keep
pouring out like rain

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:29.735
I need a mad scientist to check my brain

00:13:29.759 --> 00:13:31.066

00:13:31.090 --> 00:13:38.090

that will never happen again.

00:13:42.468 --> 00:13:44.409

00:13:44.433 --> 00:13:46.621
So now, what's great
about these free-stylers,

00:13:46.645 --> 00:13:48.507
they will get cued different words.

00:13:48.531 --> 00:13:49.975
They don't know what's coming,

00:13:49.999 --> 00:13:51.915
but they'll hear something off the cuff.

00:13:51.939 --> 00:13:53.348
Go hit that right sound icon,

00:13:53.372 --> 00:13:56.092

so what do we see in his brain?

This is four rappers' brains.

but then, eyes closed --

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:26.313
when you are freestyling vs. memorizing,

00:15:26.337 --> 00:15:28.491
you've got major visual areas lighting up.

00:15:28.515 --> 00:15:32.204
You've got major cerebellar activity,
which is involved in motor coordination.

00:15:32.228 --> 00:15:35.584
You have heightened brain activity
when you're doing a comparable task,

00:15:35.608 --> 00:15:38.566
when that one task is creative
and the other task is memorized.

00:15:38.590 --> 00:15:41.374
It's very preliminary,
but I think it's kind of cool.

00:15:41.398 --> 00:15:43.706
To conclude, we've got
a lot of questions to ask,

00:15:43.730 --> 00:15:46.635
and like I said, we'll ask questions
here, not answer them.

00:15:46.659 --> 00:15:50.110
But we want to get at the root
of what is creative genius neurologically,

00:15:50.134 --> 00:15:52.691
and I think, with these methods,
we're getting close.

00:15:52.715 --> 00:15:55.018
And I think, hopefully
in the next 10, 20 years,

00:15:55.042 --> 00:15:56.939
you'll see real, meaningful studies

00:15:56.963 --> 00:15:59.976
that say science has to catch up to art,

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:02.388
