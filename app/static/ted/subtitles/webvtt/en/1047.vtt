00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
There are two groups of women

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
when it comes to screening mammography --

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
women in whom mammography works very well

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
and has saved thousands of lives

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
and women in whom it doesn't work well at all.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Do you know which group you're in?

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
If you don't, you're not alone.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Because the breast has become

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
a very political organ.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
The truth has become lost

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
in all the rhetoric

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
coming from the press, politicians,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
radiologists

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
and medical imaging companies.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
I will do my best this morning

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
to tell you what I think is the truth.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
But first, my disclosures.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
I am not a breast cancer survivor.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
I'm not a radiologist.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
I don't have any patents,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
and I've never received any money from a medical imaging company,

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
and I am not seeking your vote.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
(Laughter)

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
What I am

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
is a doctor of internal medicine

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
who became passionately interested in this topic

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
about 10 years ago

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
when a patient asked me a question.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
She came to see me

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
after discovering a breast lump.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
Her sister had been diagnosed with breast cancer

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
in her 40s.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
She and I were both very pregnant at that time,

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
and my heart just ached for her,

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
imagining how afraid she must be.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
Fortunately, her lump proved to be benign.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
But she asked me a question:

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
how confident was I

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
that I would find a tumor early on her mammogram

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
if she developed one?

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
So I studied her mammogram,

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
and I reviewed the radiology literature,

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
and I was shocked to discover

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
that, in her case,

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
our chances of finding a tumor early on the mammogram

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
were less than the toss of a coin.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
You may recall a year ago

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
when a firestorm erupted

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.000
after the United States Preventive Services Task Force

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
reviewed the world's mammography screening literature

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
and issued a guideline

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
recommending against screening mammograms

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
in women in their 40s.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
Now everybody rushed to criticize the Task Force,

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
even though most of them weren't in anyway familiar

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
with the mammography studies.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
It took the Senate just 17 days

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
to ban the use of the guidelines

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000
in determining insurance coverage.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
Radiologists were outraged

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
by the guidelines.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
The pre-eminent mammographer in the United States

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
issued the following quote

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000
to the Washington Post.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000
The radiologists were, in turn, criticized

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000
for protecting their own financial self-interest.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
But in my view,

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
the radiologists are heroes.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
There's a shortage of radiologists

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
qualified to read mammograms,

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
and that's because mammograms are one of the most complex

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
of all radiology studies to interpret,

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
and because radiologists

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
are sued more often

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
over missed breast cancer

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
than any other cause.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000
But that very fact is telling.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000
Where there is this much legal smoke,

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000
there is likely to be some fire.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000
The factor most responsible for that fire

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
is breast density.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000
Breast density refers to the relative amount of fat --

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000
pictured here in yellow --

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
versus connective and epithelial tissues --

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
pictured in pink.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
And that proportion

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
is primarily genetically determined.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
Two-thirds of women in their 40s

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000
have dense breast tissue,

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.000
which is why mammography doesn't work as well in them.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.000
And although breast density generally declines with age,

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000
up to a third of women

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000
retain dense breast tissue

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000
for years after menopause.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.000
So how do you know if your breasts are dense?

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000
Well, you need to read the details

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000
of your mammography report.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000
Radiologists classify breast density

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
into four categories

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.000
based on the appearance of the tissue on a mammogram.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.000
If the breast is less than 25 percent dense,

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000
that's called fatty-replaced.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000
The next category

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000
is scattered fibroglandular densities,

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000
followed by heterogeneously dense

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000
and extremely dense.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000
And breasts that fall into these two categories

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000
are considered dense.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000
The problem with breast density

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000
is that it's truly the wolf in sheep's clothing.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000
Both tumors and dense breast tissue

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.000
appear white on a mammogram,

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.000
and the X-ray often can't distinguish between the two.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000
So it's easy to see this tumor

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.000
in the upper part of this fatty breast.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000
But imagine how difficult it would be

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.000
to find that tumor in this dense breast.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000
That's why mammograms find

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.000
over 80 percent of tumors in fatty breasts,

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.000
but as few as 40 percent in extremely dense breasts.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
Now it's bad enough that breast density

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000
makes it hard to find a cancer,

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000
but it turns out

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000
that it's also a powerful predictor

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000
of your risk for breast cancer.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000
It's a stronger risk factor

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.000
than having a mother or a sister with breast cancer.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.000
At the time my patient posed this question to me,

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000
breast density was an obscure topic

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000
in the radiology literature,

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000
and very few women having mammograms,

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000
or the physicians ordering them,

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000
knew about this.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000
But what else could I offer her?

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.000
Mammograms have been around since the 1960's,

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000
and it's changed very little.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.000
There have been surprisingly few innovations,

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000
until digital mammography was approved

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.000
in 2000.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.000
Digital mammography is still an X-ray of the breast,

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.000
but the images

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000
can be stored and manipulated digitally,

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.000
just like we can with a digital camera.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000
The U.S. has invested

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000
four billion dollars

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.000
converting to digital mammography equipment,

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.000
and what have we gained from that investment?

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:57.000
In a study funded by over 25 million taxpayer dollars,

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.000
digital mammography was found

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000
to be no better over all

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.000
than traditional mammography,

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.000
and in fact, it was worse in older women.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.000
But it was better in one group,

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.000
and that was women under 50

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.000
who were pre-menopausal and had dense breasts,

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.000
and in those women,

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.000
digital mammography found twice as many cancers,

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.000
but it still only found 60 percent.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000
So digital mammography

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000
has been a giant leap forward

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000
for manufacturers

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000
of digital mammography equipment,

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000
but it's been a very small step forward for

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000
womankind.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.000
What about ultrasound?

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000
Ultrasound generates more biopsies

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.000
that are unnecessary relative to other technologies,

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.000
so it's not widely used.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.000
And MRI is exquisitely sensitive for finding tumors,

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.000
but it's also very expensive.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.000
If we think about disruptive technology,

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000
we see an almost ubiquitous pattern

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.000
of the technology getting smaller and less expensive.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.000
Think about iPods compared to stereos.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.000
But it's the exact opposite in health care.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.000
The machines get ever bigger

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000
and ever more expensive.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.000
Screening the average young woman with an MRI

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.000
is kind of like driving to the grocery store in a Hummer.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.000
It's just way too much equipment.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.000
One MRI scan

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:25.000
costs 10 times what a digital mammogram costs.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.000
And sooner or later, we're going to have to accept the fact

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000
that health care innovation

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:32.000
can't always come at a much higher price.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000
Malcolm Gladwell wrote an article in the New Yorker

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.000
on innovation,

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:41.000
and he made the case that scientific discoveries

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:45.000
are rarely the product of one individual's genius.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.000
Rather, big ideas can be orchestrated,

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.000
if you can simply gather

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000
people with different perspectives in a room

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000
and get them to talk about things

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.000
that they don't ordinarily talk about.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:59.000
It's like the essence of TED.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.000
He quotes one innovator who says,

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:05.000
"The only time a physician and a physicist get together

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.000
is when the physicist gets sick."

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.000
(Laughter)

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.000
This makes no sense,

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.000
because physicians have all kinds of problems

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:16.000
that they don't realize have solutions.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.000
And physicists have all kinds of solutions for things

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:21.000
that they don't realize are problems.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:24.000
Now, take a look at this cartoon

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000
that accompanied Gladwell's article,

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000
and tell me if you see something disturbing

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.000
about this depiction of innovative thinkers.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.000
(Laughter)

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:37.000
So if you will allow me a little creative license,

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.000
I will tell you the story

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.000
of the serendipitous collision

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.000
of my patient's problem

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.000
with a physicist's solution.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.000
Shortly after her visit,

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.000
I was introduced to a nuclear physicist

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000
at Mayo

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.000
named Michael O'Conner,

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.000
who was a specialist in cardiac imaging,

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.000
something I had nothing to do with.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.000
And he happened to tell me

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:02.000
about a conference he'd just returned from in Israel,

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:05.000
where they were talking about a new type of gamma detector.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.000
Now gamma imaging has been around for a long time

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.000
to image the heart,

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.000
and it had even been tried to image the breast.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.000
But the problem was

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.000
that the gamma detectors

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.000
were these huge, bulky tubes,

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.000
and they were filled with these scintillating crystals,

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:23.000
and you just couldn't get them close enough around the breast

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.000
to find small tumors.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.000
But the potential advantage was

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.000
that gamma rays, unlike X-rays,

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:32.000
are not influenced by breast density.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.000
But this technology

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.000
could not find tumors when they're small,

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.000
and finding a small tumor is critical for survival.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.000
If you can find a tumor

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.000
when it's less than a centimeter,

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.000
survival exceeds 90 percent,

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.000
but drops off rapidly

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.000
as tumor size increases.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.000
But Michael told me about

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.000
a new type of gamma detector that he'd seen,

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.000
and this is it.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.000
It's made

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.000
not of a bulky tube,

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.000
but of a thin layer of a semiconductor material

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.000
that serves as the gamma detector.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.000
And I started talking to him

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.000
about this problem with breast density,

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:12.000
and we realized that we might be able to get this detector

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.000
close enough around the breast

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.000
to actually find small tumors.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.000
So after putting together

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:21.000
a grid of these cubes with tape --

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:24.000
(Laughter)

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:27.000
-- Michael hacked off the X-ray plate

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.000
of a mammography machine

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.000
that was about to be thrown out,

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:34.000
and we attached the new detector,

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.000
and we decided to call this machine

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:39.000
Molecular Breast Imaging, or MBI.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.000
This is an image from our first patient.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.000
And you can see, using the old gamma technology,

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.000
that it just looked like noise.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.000
But using our new detector,

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:51.000
we could begin to see the outline of a tumor.

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:53.000
So here we were, a nuclear physicist,

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.000
an internist,

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:58.000
soon joined by Carrie Hruska, a biomedical engineer,

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.000
and two radiologists,

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.000
and we were trying to take on

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:04.000
the entrenched world of mammography

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:07.000
with a machine that was held together by duct tape.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.000
To say that we faced

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.000
high doses of skepticism

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.000
in those early years

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.000
is just a huge understatement,

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:19.000
but we were so convinced that we might be able to make this work

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:22.000
that we chipped away with incremental modifications

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.000
to this system.

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.000
This is our current detector.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.000
And you can see that it looks a lot different.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:32.000
The duct tape is gone,

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.000
and we added a second detector on top of the breast,

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:37.000
which has further improved our tumor detection.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.000
So how does this work?

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:42.000
The patient receives an injection of a radio tracer

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:45.000
that's taken up by rapidly proliferating tumor cells,

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:47.000
but not by normal cells,

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:50.000
and this is the key difference from mammography.

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.000
Mammography relies on differences

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:55.000
in the appearance of the tumor from the background tissue,

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:57.000
and we've seen that those differences

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:00.000
can be obscured in a dense breast.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.000
But MBI exploits

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:05.000
the different molecular behavior of tumors,

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:08.000
and therefore, it's impervious to breast density.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:11.000
After the injection,

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.000
the patient's breast is placed between the detectors.

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:15.000
And if you've ever had a mammogram --

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:17.000
if you're old enough to have had a mammogram --

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:19.000
you know what comes next:

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:21.000
pain.

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:23.000
You may be surprised to know

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:26.000
that mammography is the only radiologic study

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.000
that's regulated by federal law,

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.000
and the law requires

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:33.000
that the equivalent of a 40-pound car battery

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:36.000
come down on your breast during this study.

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.000
But with MBI,

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:42.000
we use just light, pain-free compression.

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:48.000
(Applause)

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.000
And the detector

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:52.000
then transmits the image to the computer.

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.000
So here's an example.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.000
You can see, on the right, a mammogram

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.000
showing a faint tumor,

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.000
the edges of which are blurred by the dense tissue.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:03.000
But the MBI image shows that tumor much more clearly,

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:05.000
as well as a second tumor,

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:08.000
which profoundly influence that patient's surgical options.

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:12.000
In this example, although the mammogram found one tumor,

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:15.000
we were able to demonstrate three discrete tumors --

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:17.000
one is small as three millimeters.

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:21.000
Our big break came in 2004.

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:26.000
After we had demonstrated that we could find small tumors,

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:28.000
we used these images

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:31.000
to submit a grant to the Susan G. Komen Foundation.

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:34.000
And we were elated when they took a chance

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:36.000
on a team of completely unknown investigators

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.000
and funded us to study

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.000
1,000 women with dense breasts,

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:43.000
comparing a screening mammogram to an MBI.

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:45.000
Of the tumors that we found,

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.000
mammography found

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:50.000
only 25 percent of those tumors.

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:53.000
MBI found 83 percent.

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:56.000
Here's an example from that screening study.

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:58.000
The digital mammogram was read as normal

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:00.000
and shows lots of dense tissue,

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:03.000
but the MBI shows an area of intense uptake,

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:06.000
which correlated with a two-centimeter tumor.

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:09.000
In this case, a one-centimeter tumor.

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:11.000
And in this case,

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:14.000
a 45-year-old medical secretary at Mayo,

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:17.000
who had lost her mother to breast cancer when she was very young,

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:19.000
wanted to enroll in our study.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:22.000
And her mammogram showed an area of very dense tissue,

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:24.000
but her MBI showed an area

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.000
of worrisome uptake,

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:29.000
which we can also see on a color image.

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:31.000
And this corresponded

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:33.000
to a tumor the size of a golf ball.

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:35.000
But fortunately it was removed

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:38.000
before it had spread to her lymph nodes.

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:41.000
So now that we knew that this technology

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:44.000
could find three times more tumors in a dense breast,

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:47.000
we had to solve one very important problem.

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:50.000
We had to figure out how to lower the radiation dose,

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:53.000
and we have spent the last three years

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:56.000
making modifications to every aspect of the imaging system

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:58.000
to allow this.

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:01.000
And I'm very happy to report that we're now using a dose of radiation

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.000
that is equivalent to the effective dose

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:05.000
from one digital mammogram.

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:08.000
And at this low dose, we're continuing this screening study,

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:11.000
and this image from three weeks ago

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:13.000
in a 67-year-old woman

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:15.000
shows a normal digital mammogram,

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:17.000
but an MBI image

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:20.000
showing an uptake that proved to be a large cancer.

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:23.000
So this is not just young women that it's benefiting.

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:26.000
It's also older women with dense tissue.

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:29.000
And we're now routinely using one-fifth the radiation dose

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:32.000
that's used in any other type of gamma technology.

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:36.000
MBI generates four images per breast.

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:39.000
MRI generates over a thousand.

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:41.000
It takes a radiologist

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:43.000
years of specialty training

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:45.000
to become expert in differentiating

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:47.000
the normal anatomic detail

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:49.000
from the worrisome finding.

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:52.000
But I suspect even the non-radiologists in the room

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:55.000
can find the tumor on the MBI image.

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:57.000
But this is why MBI

00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:59.000
is so potentially disruptive --

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:01.000
it's as accurate as MRI,

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:04.000
it's far less complex to interpret,

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:06.000
and it's a fraction of the cost.

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:08.000
But you can understand why there may be

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:10.000
forces in the breast-imaging world

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:13.000
who prefer the status quo.

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:17.000
After achieving what we felt were remarkable results,

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:20.000
our manuscript was rejected

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:22.000
by four journals.

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:24.000
After the fourth rejection,

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:26.000
we requested reconsideration of the manuscript,

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:28.000
because we strongly suspected

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:30.000
that one of the reviewers who had rejected it

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:32.000
had a financial conflict of interest

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:35.000
in a competing technology.

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:37.000
Our manuscript was then accepted

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:40.000
and will be published later this month

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:42.000
in the journal Radiology.

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:50.000
(Applause)

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:53.000
We still need to complete the screening study using the low dose,

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:55.000
and then our findings will need to be replicated

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:57.000
at other institutions,

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:00.000
and this could take five or more years.

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:03.000
If this technology is widely adopted,

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:06.000
I will not benefit financially in any way,

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:09.000
and that is very important to me,

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:12.000
because it allows me to continue to tell you the truth.

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:15.000
But I recognize --

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:19.000
(Applause)

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:22.000
I recognize that the adoption of this technology

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:24.000
will depend as much on economic

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:26.000
and political forces

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:29.000
as it will on the soundness of the science.

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:32.000
The MBI unit has now been FDA approved,

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:35.000
but it's not yet widely available.

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:37.000
So until something is available

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:39.000
for women with dense breasts,

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:41.000
there are things that you should know

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:43.000
to protect yourself.

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:45.000
First, know your density.

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:47.000
Ninety percent of women don't,

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:49.000
and 95 percent of women don't know

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:52.000
that it increases your breast cancer risk.

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:55.000
The State of Connecticut became the first and only state

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:57.000
to mandate that women receive notification

00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:59.000
of their breast density

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:02.000
after a mammogram.

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:05.000
I was at a conference of 60,000 people in breast-imaging

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:07.000
last week in Chicago,

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:10.000
and I was stunned that there was a heated debate

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:12.000
as to whether we should be telling women

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:14.000
what their breast density is.

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:16.000
Of course we should.

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:19.000
And if you don't know, please ask your doctor

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:22.000
or read the details of your mammography report.

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:24.000
Second, if you're pre-menopausal,

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:26.000
try to schedule your mammogram

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:28.000
in the first two weeks of your menstrual cycle,

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:31.000
when breast density is relatively lower.

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:34.000
Third, if you notice a persistent change in your breast,

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:37.000
insist on additional imaging.

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:39.000
And fourth and most important,

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:42.000
the mammography debate will rage on,

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:45.000
but I do believe that all women 40 and older

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:47.000
should have an annual mammogram.

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:49.000
Mammography isn't perfect,

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:51.000
but it's the only test that's been proven

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:54.000
to reduce mortality from breast cancer.

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:56.000
But this mortality banner

00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:58.000
is the very sword

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:01.000
which mammography's most ardent advocates use

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:03.000
to deter innovation.

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:06.000
Some women who develop breast cancer

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:08.000
die from it many years later,

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:10.000
and most women, thankfully, survive.

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:12.000
So it takes 10 or more years

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:14.000
for any screening method

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:16.000
to demonstrate a reduction

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:18.000
in mortality from breast cancer.

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:20.000
Mammography's the only one that's been around long enough

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:23.000
to have a chance of making that claim.

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:26.000
It is time for us to accept

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:28.000
both the extraordinary successes of mammography

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:30.000
and the limitations.

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:32.000
We need to individualize screening

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:34.000
based on density.

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:36.000
For women without dense breasts,

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:39.000
mammography is the best choice.

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:41.000
But for women with dense breasts;

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:43.000
we shouldn't abandon screening altogether,

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:46.000
we need to offer them something better.

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:50.000
The babies that we were carrying

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:53.000
when my patient first asked me this question

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:56.000
are now both in middle school,

00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:59.000
and the answer has been so slow to come.

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:03.000
She's given me her blessing

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:06.000
to share this story with you.

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:08.000
After undergoing biopsies

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:11.000
that further increased her risk for cancer

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:13.000
and losing her sister to cancer,

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:15.000
she made the difficult decision

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:18.000
to have a prophylactic mastectomy.

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:22.000
We can and must do better,

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:25.000
not just in time for her granddaughters

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:27.000
and my daughters,

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:29.000
but in time for you.

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:31.000
Thank you.

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:47.000
(Applause)
