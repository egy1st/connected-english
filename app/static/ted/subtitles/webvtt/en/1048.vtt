00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
So the Awesome story:

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
It begins about 40 years ago,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
when my mom and my dad came to Canada.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
My mom left Nairobi, Kenya.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
My dad left a small village outside of Amritsar, India.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
And they got here in the late 1960s.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
They settled in a shady suburb about an hour east of Toronto,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
and they settled into a new life.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
They saw their first dentist,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
they ate their first hamburger,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
and they had their first kids.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
My sister and I

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
grew up here,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
and we had quiet, happy childhoods.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
We had close family,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
good friends, a quiet street.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
We grew up taking for granted

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
a lot of the things that my parents couldn't take for granted

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
when they grew up --

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
things like power always on

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
in our houses,

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
things like schools across the street

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
and hospitals down the road

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
and popsicles in the backyard.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
We grew up, and we grew older.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
I went to high school.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
I graduated.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
I moved out of the house, I got a job,

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
I found a girl, I settled down --

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
and I realize it sounds like a bad sitcom or a Cat Stevens' song --

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
(Laughter)

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
but life was pretty good.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
Life was pretty good.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
2006 was a great year.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
Under clear blue skies in July in the wine region of Ontario,

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
I got married,

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
surrounded by 150 family and friends.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
2007 was a great year.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
I graduated from school,

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
and I went on a road trip with two of my closest friends.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
Here's a picture of me and my friend, Chris,

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
on the coast of the Pacific Ocean.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
We actually saw seals out of our car window,

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
and we pulled over to take a quick picture of them

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
and then blocked them with our giant heads.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
(Laughter)

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
So you can't actually see them,

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
but it was breathtaking,

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
believe me.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
(Laughter)

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
2008 and 2009 were a little tougher.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
I know that they were tougher for a lot of people,

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
not just me.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
First of all, the news was so heavy.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
It's still heavy now, and it was heavy before that,

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
but when you flipped open a newspaper, when you turned on the TV,

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
it was about ice caps melting,

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
wars going on around the world,

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000
earthquakes, hurricanes

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000
and an economy that was wobbling on the brink of collapse,

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000
and then eventually did collapse,

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
and so many of us losing our homes,

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
or our jobs,

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
or our retirements,

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
or our livelihoods.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000
2008, 2009 were heavy years for me for another reason, too.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000
I was going through a lot of personal problems at the time.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000
My marriage wasn't going well,

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.000
and we just were growing further and further apart.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
One day my wife came home from work

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000
and summoned the courage, through a lot of tears,

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000
to have a very honest conversation.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000
And she said, "I don't love you anymore,"

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.000
and it was one of the most painful things I'd ever heard

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
and certainly the most heartbreaking thing I'd ever heard,

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000
until only a month later,

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000
when I heard something even more heartbreaking.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
My friend Chris, who I just showed you a picture of,

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000
had been battling mental illness for some time.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
And for those of you

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
whose lives have been touched by mental illness,

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000
you know how challenging it can be.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
I spoke to him on the phone at 10:30 p.m.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000
on a Sunday night.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.000
We talked about the TV show we watched that evening.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.000
And Monday morning, I found out that he disappeared.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.000
Very sadly, he took his own life.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000
And it was a really heavy time.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000
And as these dark clouds were circling me,

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.000
and I was finding it really, really difficult

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000
to think of anything good,

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.000
I said to myself that I really needed a way

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.000
to focus on the positive somehow.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000
So I came home from work one night,

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000
and I logged onto the computer,

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000
and I started up a tiny website

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.000
called 1000awesomethings.com.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
I was trying to remind myself

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000
of the simple, universal, little pleasures that we all love,

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000
but we just don't talk about enough --

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000
things like waiters and waitresses

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000
who bring you free refills without asking,

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000
being the first table to get called up

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000
to the dinner buffet at a wedding,

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000
wearing warm underwear from just out of the dryer,

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000
or when cashiers open up a new check-out lane at the grocery store

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000
and you get to be first in line --

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.000
even if you were last at the other line, swoop right in there.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.000
(Laughter)

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000
And slowly over time,

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000
I started putting myself in a better mood.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000
I mean, 50,000 blogs

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000
are started a day,

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.000
and so my blog was just one of those 50,000.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.000
And nobody read it except for my mom.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000
Although I should say that my traffic did skyrocket

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000
and go up by 100 percent

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000
when she forwarded it to my dad.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000
(Laughter)

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
And then I got excited

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000
when it started getting tens of hits,

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000
and then I started getting excited when it started getting dozens

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000
and then hundreds and then thousands

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000
and then millions.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000
It started getting bigger and bigger and bigger.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000
And then I got a phone call,

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000
and the voice at the other end of the line said,

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.000
"You've just won the Best Blog In the World award."

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000
I was like, that sounds totally fake.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.000
(Laughter)

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:22.000
(Applause)

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.000
Which African country do you want me to wire all my money to?

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.000
(Laughter)

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000
But it turns out, I jumped on a plane,

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000
and I ended up walking a red carpet

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.000
between Sarah Silverman and Jimmy Fallon and Martha Stewart.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.000
And I went onstage to accept a Webby award for Best Blog.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000
And the surprise

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000
and just the amazement of that

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.000
was only overshadowed by my return to Toronto,

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000
when, in my inbox,

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.000
10 literary agents were waiting for me

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.000
to talk about putting this into a book.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.000
Flash-forward to the next year

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000
and "The Book of Awesome" has now been

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000
number one on the bestseller list for 20 straight weeks.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:06.000
(Applause)

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000
But look, I said I wanted to do three things with you today.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000
I said I wanted to tell you the Awesome story,

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000
I wanted to share with you the three As of Awesome,

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000
and I wanted to leave you with a closing thought.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.000
So let's talk about those three As.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.000
Over the last few years,

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000
I haven't had that much time to really think.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.000
But lately I have had the opportunity to take a step back

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.000
and ask myself: "What is it over the last few years

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000
that helped me grow my website,

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000
but also grow myself?"

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000
And I've summarized those things, for me personally,

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000
as three As.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.000
They are Attitude, Awareness

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000
and Authenticity.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.000
I'd love to just talk about each one briefly.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.000
So Attitude:

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000
Look, we're all going to get lumps,

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000
and we're all going to get bumps.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:52.000
None of us can predict the future, but we do know one thing about it

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:55.000
and that's that it ain't gonna go according to plan.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.000
We will all have high highs

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.000
and big days and proud moments

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000
of smiles on graduation stages,

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.000
father-daughter dances at weddings

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.000
and healthy babies screeching in the delivery room,

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.000
but between those high highs,

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:11.000
we may also have some lumps and some bumps too.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.000
It's sad, and it's not pleasant to talk about,

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.000
but your husband might leave you,

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.000
your girlfriend could cheat,

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:22.000
your headaches might be more serious than you thought,

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:26.000
or your dog could get hit by a car on the street.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.000
It's not a happy thought,

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:31.000
but your kids could get mixed up in gangs

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.000
or bad scenes.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.000
Your mom could get cancer,

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.000
your dad could get mean.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.000
And there are times in life

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.000
when you will be tossed in the well, too,

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.000
with twists in your stomach and with holes in your heart,

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.000
and when that bad news washes over you,

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.000
and when that pain sponges and soaks in,

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.000
I just really hope you feel

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000
like you've always got two choices.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000
One, you can swirl and twirl

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.000
and gloom and doom forever,

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.000
or two, you can grieve

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000
and then face the future

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000
with newly sober eyes.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:05.000
Having a great attitude is about choosing option number two,

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.000
and choosing, no matter how difficult it is,

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.000
no matter what pain hits you,

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.000
choosing to move forward and move on

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.000
and take baby steps into the future.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:19.000
The second "A" is Awareness.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:23.000
I love hanging out with three year-olds.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.000
I love the way that they see the world,

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.000
because they're seeing the world for the first time.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:30.000
I love the way that they can stare at a bug crossing the sidewalk.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000
I love the way that they'll stare slack-jawed

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.000
at their first baseball game

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.000
with wide eyes and a mitt on their hand,

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.000
soaking in the crack of the bat and the crunch of the peanuts

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.000
and the smell of the hotdogs.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:43.000
I love the way that they'll spend hours picking dandelions in the backyard

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.000
and putting them into a nice centerpiece

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.000
for Thanksgiving dinner.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.000
I love the way that they see the world,

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000
because they're seeing the world

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.000
for the first time.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.000
Having a sense of awareness

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:59.000
is just about embracing your inner three year-old.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.000
Because you all used to be three years old.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.000
That three-year-old boy is still part of you.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.000
That three-year-old girl is still part of you.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.000
They're in there.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:10.000
And being aware is just about remembering

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.000
that you saw everything you've seen

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.000
for the first time once, too.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:17.000
So there was a time when it was your first time ever

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.000
hitting a string of green lights on the way home from work.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:22.000
There was the first time you walked by the open door of a bakery

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.000
and smelt the bakery air,

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:27.000
or the first time you pulled a 20-dollar bill out of your old jacket pocket

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:30.000
and said, "Found money."

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:34.000
The last "A" is Authenticity.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:37.000
And for this one, I want to tell you a quick story.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.000
Let's go all the way back to 1932

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:43.000
when, on a peanut farm in Georgia,

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:46.000
a little baby boy named Roosevelt Grier was born.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:50.000
Roosevelt Grier, or Rosey Grier, as people used to call him,

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.000
grew up and grew into

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:56.000
a 300-pound, six-foot-five linebacker in the NFL.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:59.000
He's number 76 in the picture.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:02.000
Here he is pictured with the "fearsome foursome."

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.000
These were four guys on the L.A. Rams in the 1960s

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.000
you did not want to go up against.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:09.000
They were tough football players doing what they love,

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.000
which was crushing skulls

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.000
and separating shoulders on the football field.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.000
But Rosey Grier also had

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:17.000
another passion.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:20.000
In his deeply authentic self,

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:23.000
he also loved needlepoint. (Laughter)

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.000
He loved knitting.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.000
He said that it calmed him down, it relaxed him,

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:31.000
it took away his fear of flying and helped him meet chicks.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:33.000
That's what he said.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.000
I mean, he loved it so much that, after he retired from the NFL,

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.000
he started joining clubs.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.000
And he even put out a book

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.000
called "Rosey Grier's Needlepoint for Men."

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.000
(Laughter)

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:47.000
(Applause)

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.000
It's a great cover.

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:52.000
If you notice, he's actually needlepointing his own face.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:54.000
(Laughter)

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:57.000
And so what I love about this story

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.000
is that Rosey Grier

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.000
is just such an authentic person,

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:03.000
and that's what authenticity is all about.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:06.000
It's just about being you and being cool with that.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.000
And I think when you're authentic,

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.000
you end up following your heart,

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.000
and you put yourself in places

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.000
and situations and in conversations

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.000
that you love and that you enjoy.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.000
You meet people that you like talking to.

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.000
You go places you've dreamt about.

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.000
And you end you end up following your heart

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:25.000
and feeling very fulfilled.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:28.000
So those are the three A's.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.000
For the closing thought, I want to take you all the way back

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:33.000
to my parents coming to Canada.

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.000
I don't know what it would feel like

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:38.000
coming to a new country when you're in your mid-20s.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.000
I don't know, because I never did it,

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:43.000
but I would imagine that it would take a great attitude.

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:46.000
I would imagine that you'd have to be pretty aware of your surroundings

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.000
and appreciating the small wonders

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:51.000
that you're starting to see in your new world.

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.000
And I think you'd have to be really authentic,

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.000
you'd have to be really true to yourself

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:58.000
in order to get through what you're being exposed to.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.000
I'd like to pause my TEDTalk

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.000
for about 10 seconds right now,

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:05.000
because you don't get many opportunities in life to do something like this,

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:07.000
and my parents are sitting in the front row.

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:09.000
So I wanted to ask them to, if they don't mind, stand up.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:11.000
And I just wanted to say thank you to you guys.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:30.000
(Applause)

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:33.000
When I was growing up, my dad used to love telling the story

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:35.000
of his first day in Canada.

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:38.000
And it's a great story, because what happened was

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:41.000
he got off the plane at the Toronto airport,

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.000
and he was welcomed by a non-profit group,

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:45.000
which I'm sure someone in this room runs.

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:47.000
(Laughter)

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:50.000
And this non-profit group had a big welcoming lunch

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:53.000
for all the new immigrants to Canada.

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:56.000
And my dad says he got off the plane and he went to this lunch

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.000
and there was this huge spread.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:01.000
There was bread, there was those little, mini dill pickles,

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:03.000
there was olives, those little white onions.

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:05.000
There was rolled up turkey cold cuts,

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:07.000
rolled up ham cold cuts, rolled up roast beef cold cuts

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:09.000
and little cubes of cheese.

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:12.000
There was tuna salad sandwiches and egg salad sandwiches

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.000
and salmon salad sandwiches.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.000
There was lasagna, there was casseroles,

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:19.000
there was brownies, there was butter tarts,

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:22.000
and there was pies, lots and lots of pies.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.000
And when my dad tells the story, he says,

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:28.000
"The craziest thing was, I'd never seen any of that before, except bread.

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.000
(Laughter)

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.000
I didn't know what was meat, what was vegetarian.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.000
I was eating olives with pie.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:37.000
(Laughter)

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:40.000
I just couldn't believe how many things you can get here."

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:42.000
(Laughter)

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.000
When I was five years old,

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:46.000
my dad used to take me grocery shopping,

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.000
and he would stare in wonder

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:51.000
at the little stickers that are on the fruits and vegetables.

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:54.000
He would say, "Look, can you believe they have a mango here from Mexico?

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:57.000
They've got an apple here from South Africa.

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:00.000
Can you believe they've got a date from Morocco?"

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:03.000
He's like, "Do you know where Morocco even is?"

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:06.000
And I'd say, "I'm five. I don't even know where I am.

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:09.000
Is this A&amp;P?"

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:12.000
And he'd say, "I don't know where Morocco is either, but let's find out."

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:14.000
And so we'd buy the date, and we'd go home.

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.000
And we'd actually take an atlas off the shelf,

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:19.000
and we'd flip through until we found this mysterious country.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:21.000
And when we did, my dad would say,

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:23.000
"Can you believe someone climbed a tree over there,

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:25.000
picked this thing off it, put it in a truck,

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:28.000
drove it all the way to the docks

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.000
and then sailed it all the way

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.000
across the Atlantic Ocean

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.000
and then put it in another truck

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:37.000
and drove that all the way to a tiny grocery store just outside our house,

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:40.000
so they could sell it to us for 25 cents?"

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.000
And I'd say, "I don't believe that."

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:44.000
And he's like, "I don't believe it either.

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:47.000
Things are amazing. There's just so many things to be happy about."

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:49.000
When I stop to think about it, he's absolutely right.

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:51.000
There are so many things to be happy about.

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:54.000
We are the only species

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:57.000
on the only life-giving rock

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:00.000
in the entire universe that we've ever seen,

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.000
capable of experiencing

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:04.000
so many of these things.

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:07.000
I mean, we're the only ones with architecture and agriculture.

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:10.000
We're the only ones with jewelry and democracy.

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:13.000
We've got airplanes, highway lanes,

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:15.000
interior design and horoscope signs.

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:18.000
We've got fashion magazines, house party scenes.

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.000
You can watch a horror movie with monsters.

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:23.000
You can go to a concert and hear guitars jamming.

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:25.000
We've got books, buffets and radio waves,

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:27.000
wedding brides and rollercoaster rides.

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:29.000
You can sleep in clean sheets.

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:31.000
You can go to the movies and get good seats.

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:34.000
You can smell bakery air, walk around with rain hair,

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:37.000
pop bubble wrap or take an illegal nap.

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:39.000
We've got all that,

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:42.000
but we've only got 100 years to enjoy it.

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:45.000
And that's the sad part.

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:50.000
The cashiers at your grocery store,

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:53.000
the foreman at your plant,

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:56.000
the guy tailgating you home on the highway,

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:59.000
the telemarketer calling you during dinner,

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:01.000
every teacher you've ever had,

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:04.000
everyone that's ever woken up beside you,

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:06.000
every politician in every country,

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:08.000
every actor in every movie,

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:11.000
every single person in your family, everyone you love,

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:14.000
everyone in this room and you

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:17.000
will be dead in a hundred years.

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:20.000
Life is so great that we only get such a short time

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:22.000
to experience and enjoy

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:24.000
all those tiny little moments that make it so sweet.

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:26.000
And that moment is right now,

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:29.000
and those moments are counting down,

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:32.000
and those moments are always, always, always fleeting.

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:38.000
You will never be as young as you are right now.

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:42.000
And that's why I believe that if you live your life

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:44.000
with a great attitude,

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:46.000
choosing to move forward and move on

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:48.000
whenever life deals you a blow,

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:51.000
living with a sense of awareness of the world around you,

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:53.000
embracing your inner three year-old

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:56.000
and seeing the tiny joys that make life so sweet

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:58.000
and being authentic to yourself,

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:00.000
being you and being cool with that,

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:03.000
letting your heart lead you and putting yourself in experiences that satisfy you,

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:05.000
then I think you'll live a life

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:07.000
that is rich and is satisfying,

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:09.000
and I think you'll live a life that is truly awesome.

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:11.000
Thank you.
