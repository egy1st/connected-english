WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
I'm actually here

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
to make a challenge to people.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
I know there have been many challenges made to people.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
The one I'm going to make

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
is that it is time for us to reclaim

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
what peace really means.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Peace is not "Kumbaya, my Lord."

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Peace is not the dove and the rainbow --

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
as lovely as they are.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
When I see the symbols

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
of the rainbow and the dove,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
I think of personal serenity.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
I think of meditation.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
I do not think

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
about what I consider to be peace,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
which is sustainable peace

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
with justice and equality.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
It is a sustainable peace

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
in which the majority of people

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
on this planet

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
have access to enough resources

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
to live dignified lives,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
where these people have enough access

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
to education

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
and health care,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
so that they can live in freedom from want

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
and freedom from fear.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
This is called human security.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
And I am not a complete pacifist

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
like some of my really, really heavy-duty,

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
non-violent friends,

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
like Mairead McGuire.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
I understand that humans

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
are so "messed up" --

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
to use a nice word,

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
because I promised my mom

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
I'd stop using the F-bomb in public.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
And I'm trying harder and harder.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
Mom, I'm really trying.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
We need a little bit of police;

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
we need a little bit of military,

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
but for defense.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
We need to redefine

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
what makes us secure

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
in this world.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
It is not arming our country

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
to the teeth.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
It is not getting other countries

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
to arm themselves to the teeth

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
with the weapons that we produce

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
and we sell them.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
It is using that money more rationally

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.000
to make the countries of the world secure,

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000
to make the people of the world secure.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
I was thinking about

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
the recent ongoings

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
in Congress,

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
where the president is offering

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
8.4 billion dollars

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
to try to get the START vote.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
I certainly support the START vote.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000
But he's offering 84 billion dollars

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000
for the modernizing

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
of nuclear weapons.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
Do you know the figure that the U.N. talks about

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
for fulfilling the Millennium Development Goals

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000
is 80 billion dollars?

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000
Just that little bit of money,

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
which to me, I wish it was in my bank account --

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
it's not, but ...

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000
In global terms, it's a little bit of money.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000
But it's going to modernize weapons

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000
we do not need

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000
and will not be gotten rid of in our lifetime,

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
unless we get up off our ...

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000
and take action to make it happen,

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
unless we begin to believe

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
that all of the things that we've been hearing about

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
in these last two days

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
are elements of what come together

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000
to make human security.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000
It is saving the tigers.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
It is stopping the tar sands.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000
It is having access

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000
to medical equipment

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000
that can actually tell who does have cancer.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000
It is all of those things.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.000
It is using our money for all of those things.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000
It is about action.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000
I was in Hiroshima

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000
a couple of weeks ago,

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000
and His Holiness --

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000
we're sitting there in front of thousands of people in the city,

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000
and there were about eight of us Nobel laureates.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.000
And he's a bad guy. He's like a bad kid in church.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.000
We're staring at everybody, waiting our turn to speak,

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000
and he leans over to me, and he says,

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.000
"Jody, I'm a Buddhist monk."

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.000
I said, "Yes, Your Holiness.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000
Your robe gives it away."

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000
(Laughter)

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000
He said, "You know

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.000
that I kind of like meditation, and I pray."

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000
I said, "That's good. That's good.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000
We need that in the world.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000
I don't follow that, but that's cool."

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000
And he says, "But I have become skeptical.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000
I do not believe

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000
that meditation and prayer

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000
will change this world.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000
I think what we need

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000
is action."

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000
His Holiness, in his robes,

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.000
is my new action hero.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000
I spoke with Aung Sun Suu Kyi

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000
a couple of days ago.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000
As most of you know,

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.000
she's a hero for democracy in her country, Burma.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000
You probably also know

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000
that she has spent 15 of the last 20 years

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000
imprisoned for her efforts

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000
to bring about democracy.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.000
She was just released a couple of weeks ago,

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.000
and we're very concerned to see how long she will be free,

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000
because she is already out in the streets in Rangoon,

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000
agitating for change.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000
She is already out in the streets, working with the party

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000
to try to rebuild it.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.000
But I talked to her for a range of issues.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000
But one thing that I want to say,

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.000
because it's similar to what His Holiness said.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.000
She said, "You know, we have a long road to go

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.000
to finally get democracy in my country.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.000
But I don't believe in hope

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.000
without endeavor.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.000
I don't believe in the hope of change,

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000
unless we take action

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000
to make it so."

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.000
Here's another woman hero of mine.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.000
She's my friend, Dr. Shirin Ebadi,

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.000
the first Muslim woman

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000
to receive the Nobel Peace Prize.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.000
She has been in exile

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000
for the last year and a half.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.000
You ask her where she lives -- where does she live in exile?

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.000
She says the airports of the world.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.000
She is traveling because she was out of the country

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000
at the time of the elections.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000
And instead of going home,

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.000
she conferred with all the other women that she works with,

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.000
who said to her, "Stay out. We need you out.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000
We need to be able to talk to you out there,

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000
so that you can give the message

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000
of what's happening here."

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000
A year and a half --

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000
she's out speaking

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.000
on behalf of the other women in her country.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.000
Wangari Maathai --

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.000
2004 Peace laureate.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000
They call her the "Tree Lady,"

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.000
but she's more than the Tree Lady.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.000
Working for peace

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.000
is very creative.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000
It's hard work every day.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000
When she was planting those trees,

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000
I don't think most people understand

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.000
that, at the same time,

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000
she was using the action

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.000
of getting people together to plant those trees

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.000
to talk about how to overcome

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.000
the authoritarian government in her country.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.000
People could not gather

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:10.000
without getting busted and taken to jail.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.000
But if they were together planting trees for the environment,

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000
it was okay --

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.000
creativity.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.000
But it's not just iconic women

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.000
like Shirin,

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:26.000
like Aung Sun Suu Kyi, like Wangari Maathai --

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.000
it is other women in the world

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000
who are also struggling together

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.000
to change this world.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.000
The Women's League of Burma,

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.000
11 individual organizations of Burmese women

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:41.000
came together because there's strength in numbers.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:44.000
Working together is what changes our world.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.000
The Million Signatures Campaign

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.000
of women inside Burma

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:51.000
working together to change human rights,

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.000
to bring democracy to that country.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:56.000
When one is arrested and taken to prison,

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:59.000
another one comes out and joins the movement,

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:02.000
recognizing that if they work together,

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000
they will ultimately bring change

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.000
in their own country.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.000
Mairead McGuire in the middle,

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.000
Betty Williams on the right-hand side --

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000
bringing peace to Northern Ireland.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.000
I'll tell you the quick story.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.000
An IRA driver was shot,

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.000
and his car plowed into people

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.000
on the side of the street.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.000
There was a mother and three children.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.000
The children were killed on the spot.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000
It was Mairead's sister.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000
Instead of giving in

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.000
to grief, depression, defeat

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:34.000
in the face of that violence,

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.000
Mairead hooked up with Betty --

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.000
a staunch Protestant and a staunch Catholic --

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.000
and they took to the streets

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:44.000
to say, "No more violence."

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000
And they were able to get

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:49.000
tens of thousands of, primarily, women, some men,

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:52.000
in the streets to bring about change.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.000
And they have been

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.000
part of what brought peace to Northern Ireland,

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.000
and they're still working on it,

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:02.000
because there's still a lot more to do.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000
This is Rigoberta Menchu Tum.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.000
She also received the Peace Prize.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.000
She is now running for president.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:11.000
She is educating the indigenous people of her country

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:14.000
about what it means to be a democracy,

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:17.000
about how you bring democracy to the country,

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.000
about educating, about how to vote --

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:22.000
but that democracy is not just about voting;

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.000
it's about being an active citizen.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.000
That's what I got stuck doing --

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.000
the landmine campaign.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:31.000
One of the things that made this campaign work

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:34.000
is because we grew from two NGOs

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.000
to thousands

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.000
in 90 countries around the world,

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:41.000
working together in common cause to ban landmines.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:44.000
Some of the people who worked in our campaign

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.000
could only work maybe an hour a month.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.000
They could maybe volunteer that much.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.000
There were others, like myself,

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.000
who were full-time.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:55.000
But it was the actions, together, of all of us

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.000
that brought about that change.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.000
In my view, what we need today

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.000
is people getting up

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.000
and taking action

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.000
to reclaim the meaning of peace.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.000
It's not a dirty word.

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.000
It's hard work every single day.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.000
And if each of us

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.000
who cares about the different things we care about

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.000
got up off our butts

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:17.000
and volunteered

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:20.000
as much time as we could,

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.000
we would change this world,

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.000
we would save this world.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.000
And we can't wait for the other guy. We have to do it ourselves.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.000
Thank you.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:31.000
(Applause)
