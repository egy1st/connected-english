00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
I would like to tell you all

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
that you are all actually cyborgs,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
but not the cyborgs that you think.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
You're not RoboCop, and you're not Terminator,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
but you're cyborgs every time you look at a computer screen

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
or use one of your cell phone devices.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
So what's a good definition for cyborg?

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Well, traditional definition is "an organism

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
to which exogenous components have been added

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
for the purpose of adapting to new environments."

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
That came from a 1960 paper on space travel,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
because, if you think about it, space is pretty awkward.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
People aren't supposed to be there.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
But humans are curious, and they like to add things to their bodies

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
so they can go to the Alps one day

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
and then become a fish in the sea the next.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
So let's look at the concept of traditional anthropology.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
Somebody goes to another country,

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
says, "How fascinating these people are, how interesting their tools are,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
how curious their culture is."

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
And then they write a paper, and maybe a few other anthropologists read it,

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
and we think it's very exotic.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
Well, what's happening

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
is that we've suddenly found a new species.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
I, as a cyborg anthropologist, have suddenly said,

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
"Oh, wow. Now suddenly we're a new form of Homo sapiens,

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
and look at these fascinating cultures,

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
and look at these curious rituals

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
that everybody's doing around this technology.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
They're clicking on things and staring at screens."

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
Now there's a reason why I study this,

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
versus traditional anthropology.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
And the reason is that tool use,

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
in the beginning -- for thousands and thousands of years,

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
everything has been a physical modification of self.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
It has helped us to extend our physical selves,

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
go faster, hit things harder,

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
and there's been a limit on that.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
But now what we're looking at is not an extension of the physical self,

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
but an extension of the mental self,

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
and because of that, we're able to travel faster,

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
communicate differently.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
And the other thing that happens

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
is that we're all carrying around little Mary Poppins technology.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
We can put anything we want into it, and it doesn't get heavier,

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
and then we can take anything out.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
What does the inside of your computer actually look like?

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
Well, if you print it out, it looks like a thousand pounds of material

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
that you're carrying around all the time.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
And if you actually lose that information,

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
it means that you suddenly have this loss in your mind,

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
that you suddenly feel like something's missing,

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
except you aren't able to see it, so it feels like a very strange emotion.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
The other thing that happens is that you have a second self.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
Whether you like it or not, you're starting to show up online,

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
and people are interacting with your second self

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
when you're not there.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
And so you have to be careful

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
about leaving your front lawn open,

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
which is basically your Facebook wall,

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
so that people don't write on it in the middle of the night --

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
because it's very much the equivalent.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000
And suddenly we have to start to maintain our second self.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
You have to present yourself in digital life

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
in a similar way that you would in your analog life.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
So, in the same way that you wake up, take a shower and get dressed,

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
you have to learn to do that for your digital self.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
And the problem is that a lot of people now,

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
especially adolescents,

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
have to go through two adolescences.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000
They have to go through their primary one, that's already awkward,

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000
and then they go through their second self's adolescence,

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
and that's even more awkward

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
because there's an actual history

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
of what they've gone through online.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
And anybody coming in new to technology

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000
is an adolescent online right now,

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000
and so it's very awkward,

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000
and it's very difficult for them to do those things.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
So when I was little, my dad would sit me down at night and he would say,

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000
"I'm going to teach you about time and space in the future."

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
And I said, "Great."

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
And he said one day, "What's the shortest distance between two points?"

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000
And I said, "Well, that's a straight line. You told me that yesterday."

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
I thought I was very clever.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000
He said, "No, no, no. Here's a better way."

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
He took a piece of paper,

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
drew A and B on one side and the other

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.000
and folded them together so where A and B touched.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.000
And he said, "That is the shortest distance between two points."

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000
And I said, "Dad, dad, dad, how do you do that?"

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000
He said, "Well, you just bend time and space,

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000
it takes an awful lot of energy,

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000
and that's just how you do it."

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000
And I said, "I want to do that."

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000
And he said, "Well, okay."

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.000
And so, when I went to sleep for the next 10 or 20 years,

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000
I was thinking at night,

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000
"I want to be the first person to create a wormhole,

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000
to make things accelerate faster.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000
And I want to make a time machine."

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
I was always sending messages to my future self

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.000
using tape recorders.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000
But then what I realized when I went to college

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000
is that technology doesn't just get adopted

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000
because it works.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000
It gets adopted because people use it

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000
and it's made for humans.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000
So I started studying anthropology.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000
And when I was writing my thesis on cell phones,

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.000
I realized that everyone was carrying around wormholes in their pockets.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000
They weren't physically transporting themselves;

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.000
they were mentally transporting themselves.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000
They would click on a button,

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000
and they would be connected as A to B immediately.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
And I thought, "Oh, wow. I found it. This is great."

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000
So over time, time and space

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000
have compressed because of this.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000
You can stand on one side of the world,

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000
whisper something and be heard on the other.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000
One of the other ideas that comes around

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.000
is that you have a different type of time on every single device that you use.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000
Every single browser tab gives you a different type of time.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000
And because of that, you start to dig around

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
for your external memories -- where did you leave them?

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000
So now we're all these paleontologists

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000
that are digging for things that we've lost

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.000
on our external brains that we're carrying around in our pockets.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000
And that incites a sort of panic architecture --

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000
"Oh no, where's this thing?"

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000
We're all "I Love Lucy" on a great assembly line of information,

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000
and we can't keep up.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000
And so what happens is,

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000
when we bring all that into the social space,

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000
we end up checking our phones all the time.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000
So we have this thing called ambient intimacy.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000
It's not that we're always connected to everybody,

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.000
but at anytime we can connect to anyone we want.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000
And if you were able to print out everybody in your cell phone,

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000
the room would be very crowded.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.000
These are the people that you have access to right now, in general --

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.000
all of these people, all of your friends and family that you can connect to.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.000
And so there are some psychological effects that happen with this.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000
One I'm really worried about

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.000
is that people aren't taking time for mental reflection anymore,

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000
and that they aren't slowing down and stopping,

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.000
being around all those people in the room all the time

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000
that are trying to compete for their attention

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.000
on the simultaneous time interfaces,

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000
paleontology and panic architecture.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000
They're not just sitting there.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.000
And really, when you have no external input,

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000
that is a time when there is a creation of self,

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.000
when you can do long-term planning,

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.000
when you can try and figure out who you really are.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.000
And then, once you do that, you can figure out

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.000
how to present your second self in a legitimate way,

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000
instead of just dealing with everything as it comes in --

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.000
and oh, I have to do this, and I have to do this, and I have to do this.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.000
And so this is very important.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000
I'm really worried that, especially kids today,

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.000
they're not going to be dealing with this down-time,

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000
that they have an instantaneous button-clicking culture,

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000
and that everything comes to them,

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.000
and that they become very excited about it and very addicted to it.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:28.000
So if you think about it, the world hasn't stopped either.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000
It has its own external prosthetic devices,

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000
and these devices are helping us all

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000
to communicate and interact with each other.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000
But when you actually visualize it,

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.000
all the connections that we're doing right now --

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.000
this is an image of the mapping of the Internet --

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.000
it doesn't look technological.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.000
It actually looks very organic.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.000
This is the first time in the entire history of humanity

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.000
that we've connected in this way.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.000
And it's not that machines are taking over.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000
It's that they're helping us to be more human,

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.000
helping us to connect with each other.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:01.000
The most successful technology gets out of the way

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.000
and helps us live our lives.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.000
And really,

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:08.000
it ends up being more human than technology,

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.000
because we're co-creating each other all the time.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.000
And so this is the important point that I like to study:

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:16.000
that things are beautiful, that it's still a human connection --

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.000
it's just done in a different way.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.000
We're just increasing our humanness

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:23.000
and our ability to connect with each other, regardless of geography.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.000
So that's why I study cyborg anthropology.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.000
Thank you.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:31.000
(Applause)
