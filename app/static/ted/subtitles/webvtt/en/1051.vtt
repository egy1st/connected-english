WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
If we look around us,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
much of what surrounds us

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
started life as various rocks and sludge

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
buried in the ground in various places in the world.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
But, of course, they don't look like rocks and sludge now.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
They look like TV cameras, monitors,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
annoying radio mics.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
And so this magical transformation

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
is what I was trying to get at with my project,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
which became known as the Toaster Project.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
And it was also inspired by this quote

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
from Douglas Adams,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
and the situation is from "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy."

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
And the situation it describes

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
is the hero of the book -- he's a 20th-century man --

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
finds himself alone on a strange planet

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
populated only by a technologically primitive people.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
And he kind of assumes that, yes,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
he'll become -- these villagers --

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
he'll become their emperor

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
and transform their society

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
with his wonderful command of technology

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
and science and the elements,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
but, of course, realizes

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
that without the rest of human society,

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
he can barely make a sandwich,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
let alone a toaster.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
But he didn't have Wikipedia.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
So I thought, okay,

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
I'll try and make an electric toaster from scratch.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
And, working on the idea

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
that the cheapest electric toaster

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
would also be the simplest to reverse-engineer,

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
I went and bought the cheapest toaster I could find,

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
took it home

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
and was kind of dismayed to discover

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
that, inside this object,

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
which I'd bought for just 3.49 pounds,

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
there were 400 different bits

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000
made out of a hundred-plus different materials.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
I didn't have the rest of my life to do this project.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
I had maybe nine months.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
So I thought, okay, I'll start with five.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
And these were steel, mica,

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
plastic, copper and nickel.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
So, starting with steel: how do you make steel?

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
I went and knocked on the door

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
of the Rio Tinto Chair

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
of Advanced Mineral Extraction at the Royal School of Mines

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
and said, "How do you make steel?"

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
And Professor Cilliers was very kind

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
and talked me through it.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
And my vague rememberings from GCSE science --

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
well, steel comes from iron,

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
so I phoned up an iron mine.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
And said, "Hi, I'm trying to make a toaster.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000
Can I come up and get some iron?"

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
Unfortunately, when I got there -- emerges Ray.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
He had misheard me

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
and thought I was coming up because I was trying to make a poster,

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
and so wasn't prepared to take me into the mines.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
But after some nagging, I got him to do that.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000
(Video) Ray: It was Crease Limestone,

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
and that was produced

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000
by sea creatures

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000
350 million years ago

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
in a nice, warm,

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
sunny atmosphere.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
When you study geology,

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000
you can see what's happened in the past,

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.000
and there were terrific changes in the earth.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000
Thomas Thwaites: As you can see, they had the Christmas decorations up.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000
And of course, it wasn't actually a working mine anymore,

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000
because, though Ray was a miner there,

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000
the mine had closed

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000
and had been reopened as a kind of tourist attraction,

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000
because, of course, it can't compete

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000
on the scale of operations which are happening

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000
in South America, Australia, wherever.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000
But anyway, I got my suitcase of iron ore

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000
and dragged it back to London on the train,

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
and then was faced with the problem:

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000
Okay, how do you make this rock

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000
into components for a toaster?

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000
So I went back to Professor Cilliers,

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000
and he said, "Go to the library."

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000
So I did

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.000
and was looking through the undergraduate textbooks on metallurgy --

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000
completely useless for what I was trying to do.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.000
Because, of course, they don't actually tell you how to do it

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.000
if you want to do it yourself and you don't have a smelting plant.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000
So I ended up going to the History of Science Library

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000
and looking at this book.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
This is the first textbook on metallurgy

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
written in the West, at least.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000
And there you can see that woodcut

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000
is basically what I ended up doing.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.000
But instead of a bellows, I had a leaf blower.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000
(Laughter)

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.000
And that was something that reoccurred throughout the project,

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000
was, the smaller the scale you want to work on,

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000
the further back in time you have to go.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000
And so this is after

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000
a day and about half a night

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000
smelting this iron.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000
I dragged out this stuff,

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
and it wasn't iron.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
But luckily,

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
I found a patent online

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.000
for industrial furnaces that use microwaves,

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000
and at 30 minutes at full power,

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.000
and I was able to finish off the process.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000
So, my next --

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000
(Applause)

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.000
The next thing I was trying to get was copper.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000
Again, this mine

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000
was once the largest copper mine in the world.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000
It's not anymore,

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000
but I found a retired geology professor

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000
to take me down,

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.000
and he said, "Okay, I'll let you have some water from the mine."

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.000
And the reason I was interested in getting water

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000
is because water which goes through mines

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000
becomes kind of acidic

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000
and will start picking up,

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000
dissolving the minerals from the mine.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.000
And a good example of this is the Rio Tinto,

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000
which is in Portugal.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.000
As you can see, it's got lots and lots of minerals dissolved in it.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000
So many such

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.000
that it's now just a home for bacteria

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.000
who really like acidic, toxic conditions.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.000
But anyway, the water I dragged back

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000
from the Isle of Anglesey where the mine was --

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.000
there was enough copper in it

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000
such that I could cast the pins

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000
of my metal electric plug.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.000
So my next thing: I was off to Scotland

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.000
to get mica.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.000
And mica is a mineral

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.000
which is a very good insulator

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.000
and very good at insulating electricity.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.000
That's me getting mica.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000
And the last material I'm going to talk about today is plastic,

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000
and, of course,

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000
my toaster had to have a plastic case.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.000
Plastic is the defining feature

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.000
of cheap electrical goods.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.000
And so plastic comes from oil, so I phoned up BP

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.000
and spent a good half an hour

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.000
trying to convince the PR office at BP

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000
that it would be fantastic for them

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000
if they flew me to an oil rig

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000
and let me have a jug of oil.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.000
BP obviously has a bit more on their mind now.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000
But even then

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000
they weren't convinced

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.000
and said, "Okay, we'll phone you back" -- never did.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.000
So I looked at other ways of making plastic.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.000
And you can actually make plastic

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:43.000
from obviously oils which come from plants, but also from starches.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.000
So this is attempting to make

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000
potato starch plastic.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000
And for a while that was looking really good.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000
I poured it into the mold, which you can see there,

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000
which I've made from a tree trunk.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000
And it was looking good for a while,

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.000
but I left it outside, because you had to leave it outside to dry,

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000
and unfortunately I came back

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.000
and there were snails eating the unhydrolyzed bits of potato.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:07.000
So kind of out of desperation,

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:10.000
I decided that I could think laterally.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.000
And geologists have actually christened --

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.000
well, they're debating whether to christen --

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.000
the age that we're living in --

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:19.000
they're debating whether to make it a new geological epoch

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:22.000
called the Anthropocene, the age of Man.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.000
And that's because geologists of the future

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.000
would kind of see a sharp shift

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.000
in the strata of rock that is being laid down now.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:31.000
So suddenly, it will become kind of radioactive from Chernobyl

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.000
and the 2,000 or so nuclear bombs

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:36.000
that have been set off since 1945.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:40.000
And there'd also be an extinction event --

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.000
like fossils would suddenly disappear.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.000
And also, I thought

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.000
that there would be

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.000
synthetic polymers,

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.000
plastics, embedded in the rock.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.000
So I looked up a plastic --

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.000
so I decided that I could mine

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.000
some of this modern-day rock.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.000
And I went up to Manchester

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:02.000
to visit a place called Axion Recycling.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:05.000
And they're at the sharp end of what's called the WEEE,

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:09.000
which is this European electrical and electronic waste directive.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000
And that was brought into force

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.000
to try and deal with the mountain of stuff

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.000
that is just being made

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.000
and then living for a while in our homes

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.000
and then going to landfill.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.000
But this is it.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:36.000
(Music)

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.000
(Laughter)

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.000
So there's a picture

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.000
of my toaster.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:42.000
(Applause)

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.000
That's it without the case on.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:48.000
And there it is on the shelves.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.000
Thanks.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:54.000
(Applause)

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.000
Bruno Giussani: I'm told you did plug it in once.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.000
TT: Yeah, I did plug it in.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.000
I don't know if you could see,

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.000
but I was never able to make insulation for the wires.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.000
Kew Gardens were insistent

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:08.000
that I couldn't come and hack into their rubber tree.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.000
So the wires were uninsulated.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.000
So there was 240 volts

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.000
going through these homemade copper wires,

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.000
homemade plug.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.000
And for about five seconds,

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.000
the toaster toasted,

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.000
but then, unfortunately,

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:25.000
the element kind of melted itself.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:28.000
But I considered it a partial success, to be honest.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:31.000
BG: Thomas Thwaites. TT: Thanks.
