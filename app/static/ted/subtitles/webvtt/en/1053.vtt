00:00:00.928 --> 00:00:04.099
So I'm here to tell you
that we have a problem with boys,

00:00:04.123 --> 00:00:05.991
and it's a serious problem with boys.

00:00:06.757 --> 00:00:09.385
Their culture isn't working in schools,

00:00:09.409 --> 00:00:11.187
and I'm going to share with you ways

00:00:11.211 --> 00:00:13.976
that we can think
about overcoming that problem.

00:00:14.305 --> 00:00:17.271
First, I want to start
by saying, this is a boy,

00:00:17.295 --> 00:00:19.817
and this is a girl,

00:00:19.841 --> 00:00:23.389
and this is probably stereotypically
what you think of as a boy and a girl.

00:00:23.413 --> 00:00:27.196
If I essentialize gender for you today,
then you can dismiss what I have to say.

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:30.184
So I'm not going to do that,
I'm not interested in doing that.

00:00:30.208 --> 00:00:33.425
This is a different kind of boy
and a different kind of girl.

00:00:33.449 --> 00:00:37.882
So the point here is that not all boys
exist within these rigid boundaries

00:00:37.906 --> 00:00:40.096
of what we think of as boys and girls,

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:42.675
and not all girls exist
within those rigid boundaries

00:00:42.699 --> 00:00:44.091
of what we think of as girls.

00:00:44.115 --> 00:00:47.840
But, in fact, most boys
tend to be a certain way,

00:00:47.864 --> 00:00:49.841
and most girls tend to be a certain way.

00:00:49.865 --> 00:00:52.104
And the point is that, for boys,

00:00:52.128 --> 00:00:55.314
the way that they exist
and the culture that they embrace

00:00:55.338 --> 00:00:57.846
isn't working well in schools now.

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:59.094
How do we know that?

00:00:59.118 --> 00:01:03.877
The 100 girls project
tells us some really nice statistics.

00:01:03.901 --> 00:01:07.414
For example, for every 100 girls
that are suspended from school,

00:01:07.438 --> 00:01:10.358
there are 250 boys
that are suspended from school.

00:01:10.382 --> 00:01:12.705
For every 100 girls
who are expelled from school,

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:15.529
there are 335 boys
who are expelled from school.

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.427
For every 100 girls in special education,

00:01:18.451 --> 00:01:20.133
there are 217 boys.

00:01:20.642 --> 00:01:22.843
For every 100 girls
with a learning disability,

00:01:22.867 --> 00:01:24.590
there are 276 boys.

00:01:25.285 --> 00:01:29.747
For every 100 girls
with an emotional disturbance diagnosed,

00:01:29.771 --> 00:01:31.541
we have 324 boys.

00:01:31.565 --> 00:01:35.141
And by the way, all of these numbers
are significantly higher

00:01:35.165 --> 00:01:36.585
if you happen to be black,

00:01:36.609 --> 00:01:38.452
if you happen to be poor,

00:01:38.476 --> 00:01:41.000
if you happen to exist
in an overcrowded school.

00:01:42.249 --> 00:01:44.370
And if you are a boy,

00:01:44.394 --> 00:01:48.130
you're four times as likely
to be diagnosed with ADHD --

00:01:48.154 --> 00:01:50.615
Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder.

00:01:51.079 --> 00:01:54.140
Now there is another side to this.

00:01:54.164 --> 00:01:59.774
And it is important that we recognize
that women still need help in school,

00:01:59.798 --> 00:02:02.061
that salaries are still
significantly lower,

00:02:02.085 --> 00:02:04.383
even when controlled for job types,

00:02:04.407 --> 00:02:08.142
and that girls have continued to struggle
in math and science for years.

00:02:08.714 --> 00:02:09.870
That's all true.

00:02:09.894 --> 00:02:12.173
Nothing about that prevents us

00:02:12.197 --> 00:02:14.231
from paying attention
to the literacy needs

00:02:14.255 --> 00:02:16.326
of our boys between ages three and 13.

00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:18.001
And so we should.

00:02:18.025 --> 00:02:21.048
In fact, what we ought to do
is take a page from their playbook,

00:02:21.072 --> 00:02:25.319
because the initiatives and programs
that have been set in place

00:02:25.343 --> 00:02:29.184
for women in science and engineering
and mathematics are fantastic.

00:02:29.208 --> 00:02:33.138
They've done a lot of good
for girls in these situations,

00:02:33.162 --> 00:02:36.976
and we ought to be thinking about
how we can make that happen for boys too

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.277
in their younger years.

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:40.976
Even in their older years,

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.487
what we find is that
there's still a problem.

00:02:43.511 --> 00:02:45.096
When we look at the universities,

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:48.118
60 percent of baccalaureate degrees
are going to women now,

00:02:48.142 --> 00:02:49.976
which is a significant shift.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.871
And in fact, university administrators
are a little uncomfortable about the idea

00:02:53.895 --> 00:02:58.800
that we may be getting close to 70 percent
female population in universities.

00:02:58.824 --> 00:03:01.174
This makes university
administrators very nervous,

00:03:01.198 --> 00:03:04.388
because girls don't want to go
to schools that don't have boys.

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:08.628
And so we're starting to see

00:03:08.652 --> 00:03:11.809
the establishment of men centers
and men studies

00:03:11.833 --> 00:03:16.110
to think about how do we engage men
in their experiences in the university.

00:03:16.134 --> 00:03:18.911
If you talk to faculty,
they may say, "Ugh. Yeah, well,

00:03:18.935 --> 00:03:20.483
they're playing video games,

00:03:20.507 --> 00:03:23.476
and they're gambling
online all night long,

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:25.315
and they're playing World of Warcraft,

00:03:25.339 --> 00:03:29.171
and that's affecting
their academic achievement."

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:31.641
Guess what?

00:03:31.665 --> 00:03:34.136
Video games are not the cause.

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:35.975
Video games are a symptom.

00:03:36.481 --> 00:03:40.881
They were turned off a long time
before they got here.

00:03:41.127 --> 00:03:43.786
So let's talk about
why they got turned off

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:46.659
when they were between the ages
of three and 13.

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:49.069
There are three reasons that I believe

00:03:49.093 --> 00:03:52.355
that boys are out of sync
with the culture of schools today.

00:03:52.754 --> 00:03:54.976
The first is zero tolerance.

00:03:55.367 --> 00:04:00.384
A kindergarten teacher I know,
her son donated all of his toys to her,

00:04:00.408 --> 00:04:06.254
and when he did, she had to go through
and pull out all the little plastic guns.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.494
You can't have plastic knives
and swords and axes

00:04:09.518 --> 00:04:12.661
and all that kind of thing
in a kindergarten classroom.

00:04:12.685 --> 00:04:16.560
What is it that we're afraid that this
young man is going to do with this gun?

00:04:16.584 --> 00:04:17.976
I mean, really.

00:04:18.658 --> 00:04:20.976
But here he stands as testament

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.276
to the fact that you can't roughhouse
on the playground today.

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:26.309
Now I'm not advocating for bullies.

00:04:26.333 --> 00:04:31.536
I'm not suggesting that we need to be
allowing guns and knives in the school.

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:35.816
But when we say that an Eagle Scout
in a high school classroom

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:39.165
who has a locked parked car
in the parking lot and a penknife in it,

00:04:39.189 --> 00:04:41.212
has to be suspended from school,

00:04:41.236 --> 00:04:44.536
I think we may have gone
a little too far with zero tolerance.

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:46.888
Another way that zero tolerance
lives itself out

00:04:46.912 --> 00:04:48.203
is in the writing of boys.

00:04:48.227 --> 00:04:49.612
In a lot of classrooms today,

00:04:49.636 --> 00:04:52.356
you're not allowed to write
about anything that's violent.

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:55.906
You're not allowed to write about anything
that has to do with video games.

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:57.100
These topics are banned.

00:04:57.124 --> 00:04:59.072
Boy comes home from school, and he says,

00:04:59.096 --> 00:05:00.546
"I hate writing."

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:03.297
"Why do you hate writing, son?
What's wrong with writing?"

00:05:03.321 --> 00:05:05.634
"Now I have to write
what she tells me to write."

00:05:05.658 --> 00:05:07.659
"OK, what is she telling you to write?"

00:05:08.103 --> 00:05:10.464
"Poems. I have to write poems.

00:05:10.488 --> 00:05:12.484
And little moments in my life.

00:05:12.508 --> 00:05:14.484
I don't want to write that stuff."

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:16.522
"Well, what do you want to write?

00:05:16.546 --> 00:05:18.137
What do you want to write about?"

00:05:18.161 --> 00:05:21.450
"I want to write about video games.
I want to write about leveling-up.

00:05:21.474 --> 00:05:23.912
I want to write about
this really interesting world.

00:05:23.936 --> 00:05:26.765
I want to write about a tornado
that comes into our house

00:05:26.789 --> 00:05:28.301
and blows all the windows out,

00:05:28.325 --> 00:05:30.631
and ruins all the furniture
and kills everybody."

00:05:30.655 --> 00:05:32.126
"All right. OK."

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:35.873
You tell a teacher that,
and they'll ask you, in all seriousness,

00:05:35.897 --> 00:05:38.573
"Should we send this child
to the psychologist?"

00:05:39.617 --> 00:05:41.976
And the answer is no, he's just a boy.

00:05:42.512 --> 00:05:44.303
He's just a little boy.

00:05:45.176 --> 00:05:48.975
It's not OK to write these kinds of things
in classrooms today.

00:05:49.834 --> 00:05:51.129
So that's the first reason:

00:05:51.153 --> 00:05:53.702
Zero tolerance policies
and the way they're lived out.

00:05:53.726 --> 00:05:57.207
The next reason that boys' cultures
are out of sync with school cultures:

00:05:57.231 --> 00:05:58.668
there are fewer male teachers.

00:05:58.692 --> 00:06:01.451
Anybody who's over 15
doesn't know what this means,

00:06:01.475 --> 00:06:03.231
because in the last 10 years,

00:06:03.255 --> 00:06:07.048
the number of elementary school
classroom teachers has been cut in half.

00:06:07.072 --> 00:06:10.464
We went from 14 percent to seven percent.

00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:13.263
That means that 93 percent of the teachers

00:06:13.287 --> 00:06:16.406
that our young men get in elementary
classrooms are women.

00:06:17.483 --> 00:06:19.384
Now what's the problem with this?

00:06:19.737 --> 00:06:21.634
Women are great, yep, absolutely.

00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:26.782
But male role models for boys
that say it's all right to be smart --

00:06:26.806 --> 00:06:30.408
they've got dads, they've got pastors,
they've got Cub Scout leaders,

00:06:30.432 --> 00:06:33.516
but ultimately, six hours a day,
five days a week

00:06:33.540 --> 00:06:35.786
they're spending in a classroom,

00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:39.174
and most of those classrooms
are not places where men exist.

00:06:39.198 --> 00:06:42.746
And so they say, I guess this really
isn't a place for boys.

00:06:43.123 --> 00:06:44.791
This is a place for girls.

00:06:44.815 --> 00:06:46.405
And I'm not very good at this,

00:06:46.429 --> 00:06:49.637
so I guess I'd better go play video games

00:06:49.661 --> 00:06:51.672
or get into sports,
or something like that,

00:06:51.696 --> 00:06:53.578
because I obviously don't belong here.

00:06:53.602 --> 00:06:55.712
Men don't belong here,
that's pretty obvious.

00:06:55.736 --> 00:06:59.624
So that may be a very direct way
that we see it happen.

00:07:00.072 --> 00:07:03.975
But less directly, the lack of male
presence in the culture --

00:07:04.497 --> 00:07:07.687
you've got a teachers' lounge,
and they're having a conversation

00:07:07.711 --> 00:07:11.838
about Joey and Johnny
who beat each other up on the playground.

00:07:11.862 --> 00:07:13.866
"What are we going to do with these boys?"

00:07:13.890 --> 00:07:15.574
The answer to that question changes

00:07:15.598 --> 00:07:17.699
depending on who's sitting
around that table.

00:07:17.723 --> 00:07:19.283
Are there men around that table?

00:07:19.307 --> 00:07:21.757
Are there moms who've raised boys
around that table?

00:07:21.781 --> 00:07:23.523
You'll see, the conversation changes

00:07:23.547 --> 00:07:25.695
depending upon who's sitting
around the table.

00:07:25.719 --> 00:07:28.571
Third reason that boys
are out of sync with school today:

00:07:28.595 --> 00:07:31.039
Kindergarten is the old
second grade, folks.

00:07:31.063 --> 00:07:34.975
We have a serious compression
of the curriculum happening out there.

00:07:35.332 --> 00:07:38.425
When you're three, you better be able
to write your name legibly,

00:07:38.449 --> 00:07:41.026
or else we'll consider it
a developmental delay.

00:07:41.494 --> 00:07:43.137
By the time you're in first grade,

00:07:43.161 --> 00:07:45.766
you should be able to read
paragraphs of text

00:07:45.790 --> 00:07:49.270
with maybe a picture, maybe not,
in a book of maybe 25 to 30 pages.

00:07:49.294 --> 00:07:50.474
If you don't,

00:07:50.498 --> 00:07:54.173
we're probably going to be putting you
into a Title I special reading program.

00:07:54.197 --> 00:07:56.495
And if you ask Title I teachers,
they'll tell you

00:07:56.519 --> 00:08:00.138
they've got about four or five boys
for every girl that's in their program,

00:08:00.162 --> 00:08:01.366
in the elementary grades.

00:08:01.390 --> 00:08:03.144
The reason that this is a problem

00:08:03.168 --> 00:08:06.221
is because the message
that boys are getting

00:08:06.245 --> 00:08:10.587
is, "You need to do what the teacher
asks you to do all the time."

00:08:11.092 --> 00:08:15.252
The teacher's salary depends
on "No Child Left Behind"

00:08:15.276 --> 00:08:17.976
and "Race to the Top"
and accountability and testing

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:19.976
and all of this.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:23.974
So she has to figure out a way
to get all these boys

00:08:23.998 --> 00:08:26.975
through this curriculum -- and girls.

00:08:27.882 --> 00:08:31.461
This compressed curriculum is bad
for all active kids.

00:08:32.486 --> 00:08:34.306
And what happens is,

00:08:34.330 --> 00:08:38.990
she says, "Please, sit down,
be quiet, do what you're told,

00:08:39.014 --> 00:08:43.966
follow the rules, manage your time,
focus, be a girl."

00:08:45.309 --> 00:08:46.867
That's what she tells them.

00:08:46.891 --> 00:08:48.976
Indirectly, that's what she tells them.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.060
And so this is a very serious problem.

00:08:51.084 --> 00:08:53.441
Where is it coming from?
It's coming from us.

00:08:53.465 --> 00:08:55.976
(Laughter)

00:08:56.732 --> 00:08:59.700
We want our babies to read
when they are six months old.

00:08:59.724 --> 00:09:00.976
Have you seen the ads?

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:05.680
We want to live in Lake Wobegon
where every child is above average ...

00:09:06.398 --> 00:09:09.842
but what this does to our children
is really not healthy.

00:09:09.866 --> 00:09:11.676
It's not developmentally appropriate,

00:09:11.700 --> 00:09:13.676
and it's particularly bad for boys.

00:09:14.144 --> 00:09:15.419
So what do we do?

00:09:15.900 --> 00:09:17.625
We need to meet them where they are.

00:09:17.649 --> 00:09:19.913
We need to put ourselves into boy culture.

00:09:19.937 --> 00:09:25.192
We need to change the mindset
of acceptance in boys

00:09:25.216 --> 00:09:26.654
in elementary schools.

00:09:27.168 --> 00:09:30.364
More specifically, we can do
some very specific things.

00:09:30.388 --> 00:09:31.976
We can design better games.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.815
Most of the educational games
that are out there today

00:09:34.839 --> 00:09:36.364
are really flashcards.

00:09:36.388 --> 00:09:38.330
They're glorified drill and practice.

00:09:38.354 --> 00:09:41.167
They don't have the depth,
the rich narrative

00:09:41.191 --> 00:09:43.943
that really engaging video games have,

00:09:43.967 --> 00:09:45.970
that the boys are really interested in.

00:09:45.994 --> 00:09:47.636
So we need to design better games.

00:09:47.660 --> 00:09:51.486
We need to talk to teachers and parents
and school board members and politicians.

00:09:51.510 --> 00:09:55.086
We need to make sure that people see
that we need more men in the classroom.

00:09:55.110 --> 00:09:57.804
We need to look carefully
at our zero tolerance policies.

00:09:57.828 --> 00:09:58.996
Do they make sense?

00:09:59.020 --> 00:10:02.976
We need to think about how to uncompress
this curriculum if we can,

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:06.465
trying to bring boys back into a space
that is comfortable for them.

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.286
All of those conversations
need to be happening.

00:10:09.310 --> 00:10:12.113
There are some great examples
out there of schools --

00:10:12.137 --> 00:10:15.620
the New York Times
just talked about a school recently.

00:10:15.644 --> 00:10:17.976
A game designer from the New School

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.976
put together a wonderful
video gaming school.

00:10:21.392 --> 00:10:26.229
But it only treats a few kids,
and so this isn't very scalable.

00:10:26.253 --> 00:10:28.409
We have to change the culture
and the feelings

00:10:28.433 --> 00:10:33.255
that politicians and school board
members and parents have

00:10:33.279 --> 00:10:36.346
about the way we accept
and what we accept in our schools today.

00:10:36.370 --> 00:10:38.379
We need to find more money
for game design.

00:10:38.403 --> 00:10:40.757
Because good games,
really good games, cost money,

00:10:40.781 --> 00:10:42.768
and World of Warcraft has quite a budget.

00:10:42.792 --> 00:10:44.884
Most of the educational games do not.

00:10:44.908 --> 00:10:46.156
Where we started:

00:10:46.180 --> 00:10:48.976
my colleagues Mike Petner,
Shawn Vashaw, myself,

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.591
we started by trying to look
at the teachers' attitudes

00:10:51.615 --> 00:10:53.960
and find out how do they really
feel about gaming,

00:10:53.984 --> 00:10:55.244
what do they say about it.

00:10:55.268 --> 00:11:00.242
And we discovered that they talk
about the kids in their school,

00:11:00.266 --> 00:11:02.975
who talk about gaming,
in pretty demeaning ways.

00:11:03.532 --> 00:11:06.725
They say, "Oh, yeah. They're always
talking about that stuff.

00:11:06.749 --> 00:11:09.073
They're talking
about their little action figures

00:11:09.097 --> 00:11:11.485
and their little achievements
or merit badges,

00:11:11.509 --> 00:11:13.567
or whatever it is that they get.

00:11:13.591 --> 00:11:15.693
And they're always talking
about this stuff."

00:11:15.717 --> 00:11:17.674
And they say these things as if it's OK.

00:11:17.698 --> 00:11:20.976
But if it were your culture,
think of how that might feel.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.381
It's very uncomfortable
to be on the receiving end

00:11:23.405 --> 00:11:25.587
of that kind of language.

00:11:25.976 --> 00:11:29.192
They're nervous about anything
that has anything to do with violence

00:11:29.216 --> 00:11:31.101
because of the zero tolerance policies.

00:11:31.125 --> 00:11:33.236
They are sure that parents
and administrators

00:11:33.260 --> 00:11:34.558
will never accept anything.

00:11:34.582 --> 00:11:37.466
So we really need to think
about looking at teacher attitudes

00:11:37.490 --> 00:11:40.252
and finding ways to change the attitudes,

00:11:40.276 --> 00:11:44.246
so that teachers are much more open
and accepting of boy cultures

00:11:44.270 --> 00:11:45.460
in their classrooms.

00:11:45.484 --> 00:11:47.552
Because, ultimately, if we don't,

00:11:47.576 --> 00:11:50.848
then we're going to have boys
who leave elementary school saying,

00:11:50.872 --> 00:11:53.900
"Well I guess that was just
a place for girls, it wasn't for me.

00:11:53.924 --> 00:11:56.699
So I've got to do gaming,
or I've got to do sports."

00:11:57.156 --> 00:12:00.169
If we change these things,
if we pay attention to these things,

00:12:00.193 --> 00:12:02.112
and we reengage boys in their learning,

00:12:02.136 --> 00:12:05.310
they will leave the elementary
schools saying, "I'm smart."

00:12:06.134 --> 00:12:07.285
Thank you.

00:12:07.309 --> 00:12:09.785
(Applause)
