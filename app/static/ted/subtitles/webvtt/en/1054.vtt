WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
I just did something I've never done before.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
I spent a week at sea on a research vessel.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Now I'm not a scientist,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
but I was accompanying a remarkable scientific team

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
from the University of South Florida

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
who have been tracking the travels of BP's oil

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
in the Gulf of Mexico.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
This is the boat we were on, by the way.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
The scientists I was with

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
were not studying the effect of the oil and dispersants on the big stuff --

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
the birds, the turtles,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
the dolphins, the glamorous stuff.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
They're looking at the really little stuff

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
that gets eaten by the slightly less little stuff

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
that eventually gets eaten by the big stuff.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
And what they're finding

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
is that even trace amounts of oil and dispersants

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
can be highly toxic to phytoplankton,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
which is very bad news,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
because so much life depends on it.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
So contrary to what we heard a few months back

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
about how 75 percent of that oil

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
sort of magically disappeared

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
and we didn't have to worry about it,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
this disaster is still unfolding.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
It's still working its way up the food chain.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
Now this shouldn't come as a surprise to us.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
Rachel Carson --

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
the godmother of modern environmentalism --

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
warned us about this very thing

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
back in 1962.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
She pointed out that the "control men" --

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
as she called them --

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
who carpet-bombed towns and fields

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
with toxic insecticides like DDT,

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
were only trying to kill the little stuff, the insects,

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
not the birds.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
But they forgot this:

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
the fact that birds dine on grubs,

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
that robins eat lots of worms

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
now saturated with DDT.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
And so, robin eggs failed to hatch,

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
songbirds died en masse,

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
towns fell silent.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
Thus the title "Silent Spring."

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
I've been trying to pinpoint

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
what keeps drawing me back to the Gulf of Mexico,

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
because I'm Canadian,

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
and I can draw no ancestral ties.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
And I think what it is

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
is I don't think we have fully come to terms

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
with the meaning of this disaster,

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
with what it meant to witness a hole

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
ripped in our world,

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000
with what it meant to watch the contents of the Earth

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
gush forth on live TV,

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
24 hours a day,

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
for months.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000
After telling ourselves for so long

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
that our tools and technology can control nature,

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
suddenly we were face-to-face

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
with our weakness,

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
with our lack of control,

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
as the oil burst out

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000
of every attempt to contain it --

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
"top hats," "top kills"

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
and, most memorably, the "junk shot" --

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
the bright idea

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000
of firing old tires and golf balls

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
down that hole in the world.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
But even more striking

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000
than the ferocious power emanating from that well

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
was the recklessness

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
with which that power was unleashed --

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
the carelessness, the lack of planning

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
that characterized the operation

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000
from drilling to clean-up.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000
If there is one thing

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000
BP's watery improv act made clear,

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000
it is that, as a culture,

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
we have become far too willing to gamble

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
with things that are precious

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000
and irreplaceable,

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000
and to do so without a back-up plan,

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000
without an exit strategy.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000
And BP was hardly

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
our first experience of this in recent years.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000
Our leaders barrel into wars,

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
telling themselves happy stories

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.000
about cakewalks and welcome parades.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.000
Then, it is years of deadly damage control,

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.000
Frankensteins of sieges and surges

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000
and counter-insurgencies,

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000
and once again, no exit strategy.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000
Our financial wizards routinely fall victim

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000
to similar overconfidence,

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000
convincing themselves that the latest bubble

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000
is a new kind of market --

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000
the kind that never goes down.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000
And when it inevitably does,

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000
the best and the brightest

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
reach for the financial equivalent of the junk shot --

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000
in this case, throwing massive amounts

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000
of much-needed public money

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000
down a very different kind of hole.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000
As with BP, the hole does get plugged,

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000
at least temporarily,

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000
but not before

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000
exacting a tremendous price.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000
We have to figure out

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000
why we keep letting this happen,

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000
because we are in the midst

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.000
of what may be our highest-stakes gamble of all --

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
deciding what to do, or not to do,

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
about climate change.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
Now as you know,

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000
a great deal of time is spent,

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000
in this country and around the world,

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000
inside the climate debate,

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.000
on the question of, "What if the IPC scientists

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000
are all wrong?"

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000
Now a far more relevant question --

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000
as MIT physicist Evelyn Fox Keller puts it --

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.000
is, "What if those scientists are right?"

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000
Given the stakes, the climate crisis

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000
clearly calls for us to act

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000
based on the precautionary principle --

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000
the theory that holds

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000
that when human health and the environment

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000
are significantly at risk

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000
and when the potential damage is irreversible,

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000
we cannot afford to wait

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000
for perfect scientific certainty.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.000
Better to err on the side of caution.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000
More overt, the burden of proving

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000
that a practice is safe

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.000
should not be placed on the public that would be harmed,

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.000
but rather on the industry that stands to profit.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000
But climate policy in the wealthy world --

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.000
to the extent that such a thing exists --

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.000
is not based on precaution,

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.000
but rather on cost-benefit analysis --

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000
finding the course of action that economists believe

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000
will have the least impact

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000
on our GDP.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.000
So rather than asking, as precaution would demand,

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.000
what can we do as quickly as possible

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.000
to avoid potential catastrophe,

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.000
we ask bizarre questions like this:

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.000
"What is the latest possible moment we can wait

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.000
before we begin seriously lowering emissions?

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000
Can we put this off till 2020,

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.000
2030, 2050?"

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000
Or we ask,

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.000
"How much hotter can we let the planet get

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.000
and still survive?

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.000
Can we go with two degrees, three degrees, or --

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000
where we're currently going --

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000
four degrees Celsius?"

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.000
And by the way,

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.000
the assumption that we can safely control

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.000
the Earth's awesomely complex climate system

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000
as if it had a thermostat,

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.000
making the planet not too hot, not too cold,

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.000
but just right -- sort of Goldilocks style --

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000
this is pure fantasy,

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.000
and it's not coming from the climate scientists.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000
It's coming from the economists

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.000
imposing their mechanistic thinking

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.000
on the science.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.000
The fact is that we simply don't know

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000
when the warming that we create

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000
will be utterly overwhelmed

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000
by feedback loops.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000
So once again,

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000
why do we take these crazy risks

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.000
with the precious?

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.000
A range of explanations

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000
may be popping into your mind by now,

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.000
like "greed."

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.000
This is a popular explanation, and there's lots of truth to it,

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.000
because taking big risks, as we all know,

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000
pays a lot of money.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.000
Another explanation that you often hear for recklessness

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000
is hubris.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.000
And greed and hubris

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.000
are intimately intertwined

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.000
when it comes to recklessness.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.000
For instance, if you happen to be a 35-year-old banker

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.000
taking home 100 times more

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.000
than a brain surgeon,

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000
then you need a narrative,

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000
you need a story

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.000
that makes that disparity okay.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:37.000
And you actually don't have a lot of options.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:40.000
You're either an incredibly good scammer,

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.000
and you're getting away with it -- you gamed the system --

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.000
or you're some kind of boy genius,

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:47.000
the likes of which the world has never seen.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:50.000
Now both of these options -- the boy genius and the scammer --

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000
are going to make you vastly overconfident

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000
and therefore more prone

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.000
to taking even bigger risks in the future.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:01.000
By the way, Tony Hayward, the former CEO of BP,

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.000
had a plaque on his desk

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.000
inscribed with this inspirational slogan:

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.000
"What would you attempt to do

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:10.000
if you knew you could not fail?"

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:13.000
Now this is actually a popular plaque,

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.000
and this is a crowd of overachievers,

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.000
so I'm betting that some of you have this plaque.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.000
Don't feel ashamed.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.000
Putting fear of failure out of your mind

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.000
can be a very good thing

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000
if you're training for a triathlon

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:29.000
or preparing to give a TEDTalk,

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000
but personally, I think people with the power

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:34.000
to detonate our economy and ravage our ecology

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.000
would do better having

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.000
a picture of Icarus hanging from the wall,

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:41.000
because -- maybe not that one in particular --

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:44.000
but I want them thinking about the possibility of failure

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000
all of the time.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.000
So we have greed,

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000
we've got overconfidence/hubris,

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.000
but since we're here at TEDWomen,

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.000
let's consider one other factor

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.000
that could be contributing in some small way

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.000
to societal recklessness.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000
Now I'm not going to belabor this point,

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000
but studies do show that, as investors,

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.000
women are much less prone

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:09.000
to taking reckless risks than men,

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.000
precisely because, as we've already heard,

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:14.000
women tend not to suffer from overconfidence

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.000
in the same way that men do.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.000
So it turns out

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.000
that being paid less and praised less

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.000
has its upsides --

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.000
for society at least.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.000
The flipside of this

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.000
is that constantly being told

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.000
that you are gifted, chosen

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.000
and born to rule

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:35.000
has distinct societal downsides.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:38.000
And this problem -- call it the "perils of privilege" --

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.000
brings us closer, I think,

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:43.000
to the root of our collective recklessness.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.000
Because none of us -- at least in the global North --

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.000
neither men nor women,

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:50.000
are fully exempt from this message.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.000
Here's what I'm talking about.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.000
Whether we actively believe them

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.000
or consciously reject them,

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.000
our culture remains in the grips

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.000
of certain archetypal stories

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.000
about our supremacy

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.000
over others and over nature --

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:07.000
the narrative of the newly discovered frontier

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.000
and the conquering pioneer,

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.000
the narrative of manifest destiny,

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.000
the narrative of apocalypse and salvation.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.000
And just when you think these stories are fading into history,

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:17.000
and that we've gotten over them,

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:20.000
they pop up in the strangest places.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.000
For instance, I stumbled across this advertisement

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.000
outside the women's washroom

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.000
in the Kansas City airport.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.000
It's for Motorola's new Rugged cell phone,

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.000
and yes, it really does say,

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.000
"Slap Mother Nature in the face."

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.000
And I'm not just showing it to pick on Motorola --

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.000
that's just a bonus.

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.000
I'm showing it because --

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.000
they're not a sponsor, are they? --

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.000
because, in its own way,

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.000
this is a crass version

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.000
of our founding story.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.000
We slapped Mother Nature around and won,

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.000
and we always win,

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:53.000
because dominating nature is our destiny.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:56.000
But this is not the only fairytale we tell ourselves about nature.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:59.000
There's another one, equally important,

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.000
about how that very same Mother Nature

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:04.000
is so nurturing and so resilient

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:07.000
that we can never make a dent in her abundance.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.000
Let's hear from Tony Hayward again.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:12.000
"The Gulf of Mexico is a very big ocean.

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:15.000
The amount of oil and dispersants that we are putting into it

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:18.000
is tiny in relation to the total water volume."

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.000
In other words, the ocean is big;

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:23.000
she can take it.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:26.000
It is this underlying assumption of limitlessness

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.000
that makes it possible

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:31.000
to take the reckless risks that we do.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:34.000
Because this is our real master-narrative:

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.000
however much we mess up,

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.000
there will always be more --

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:41.000
more water, more land,

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:43.000
more untapped resources.

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.000
A new bubble will replace the old one.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:47.000
A new technology will come along

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:50.000
to fix the messes we made with the last one.

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.000
In a way, that is the story

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.000
of the settling of the Americas,

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.000
the supposedly inexhaustible frontier

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:59.000
to which Europeans escaped.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:02.000
And it's also the story of modern capitalism,

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.000
because it was the wealth from this land

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:07.000
that gave birth to our economic system,

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:10.000
one that cannot survive without perpetual growth

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.000
and an unending supply

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.000
of new frontiers.

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.000
Now the problem is

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.000
that the story was always a lie.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.000
The Earth always did have limits.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.000
They were just beyond our sights.

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:24.000
And now we are hitting those limits

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:27.000
on multiple fronts.

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:29.000
I believe that we know this,

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:32.000
yet we find ourselves trapped in a kind of narrative loop.

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:35.000
Not only do we continue to tell and retell

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:37.000
the same tired stories,

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.000
but we are now doing so

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:41.000
with a frenzy and a fury

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:44.000
that, frankly, verges on camp.

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:47.000
How else to explain the cultural space

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:49.000
occupied by Sarah Palin?

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:51.000
Now on the one hand,

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.000
exhorting us to "drill, baby, drill,"

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:56.000
because God put those resources into the ground

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:59.000
in order for us to exploit them,

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:02.000
and on the other, glorying in the wilderness

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:04.000
of Alaska's untouched beauty

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:07.000
on her hit reality TV show.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:10.000
The twin message is as comforting as it is mad.

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.000
Ignore those creeping fears

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.000
that we have finally hit the wall.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.000
There are still no limits.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:19.000
There will always be another frontier.

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:22.000
So stop worrying and keep shopping.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.000
Now, would that this were just about

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.000
Sarah Palin and her reality TV show.

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:28.000
In environmental circles,

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:31.000
we often hear that, rather than shifting to renewables,

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:34.000
we are continuing with business as usual.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:36.000
This assessment, unfortunately,

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.000
is far too optimistic.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:41.000
The truth is that we have already exhausted

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:44.000
so much of the easily accessible fossil fuels

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:46.000
that we have already entered

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:49.000
a far riskier business era,

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:51.000
the era of extreme energy.

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:54.000
So that means drilling for oil in the deepest water,

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.000
including the icy Arctic seas,

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:59.000
where a clean-up may simply be impossible.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:02.000
It means large-scale hydraulic fracking for gas

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.000
and massive strip-mining operations for coal,

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:07.000
the likes of which we haven't yet seen.

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:10.000
And most controversially, it means the tar sands.

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:12.000
I'm always surprised by how little

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:14.000
people outside of Canada

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.000
know about the Alberta Tar Sands,

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.000
which this year are projected to become

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:21.000
the number one source of imported oil

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:23.000
to the United States.

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:26.000
It's worth taking a moment to understand this practice,

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.000
because I believe it speaks to recklessness

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.000
and the path we're on

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.000
like little else.

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:35.000
So this is where the tar sands live,

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:37.000
under one of the last magnificent

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.000
Boreal forests.

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:41.000
The oil is not liquid.

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:43.000
You can't just drill a hole and pump it out.

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:45.000
Tar sand's oil is solid,

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:47.000
mixed in with the soil.

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:49.000
So to get at it,

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:52.000
you first have to get rid of the trees.

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:54.000
Then, you rip off the topsoil

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:57.000
and get at that oily sand.

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:00.000
The process requires a huge amount of water,

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:04.000
which is then pumped into massive toxic tailing ponds.

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:07.000
That's very bad news for local indigenous people

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:09.000
living downstream

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:12.000
who are reporting alarmingly high cancer rates.

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:14.000
Now looking at these images,

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:17.000
it's difficult to grasp the scale of this operation,

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:20.000
which can already be seen from space

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:23.000
and could grow to an area the size of England.

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:25.000
I find it helps actually

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:27.000
to look at the dump trucks that move the earth,

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:29.000
the largest ever built.

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:31.000
That's a person down there by the wheel.

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:33.000
My point is that

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:35.000
this is not oil drilling.

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:37.000
It's not even mining.

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:39.000
It is terrestrial skinning.

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:41.000
Vast, vivid landscapes

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:43.000
are being gutted,

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:45.000
left monochromatic gray.

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:48.000
Now I should confess that as [far as] I'm concerned

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:50.000
this would be an abomination

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:52.000
if it emitted not one particle of carbon.

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:55.000
But the truth is that, on average,

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:58.000
turning that gunk into crude oil

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:01.000
produces about three times more greenhouse gas pollution

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:03.000
than it does to produce conventional oil

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:05.000
in Canada.

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:07.000
How else to describe this,

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:10.000
but as a form of mass insanity?

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:13.000
Just when we know we need to be learning

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:15.000
to live on the surface of our planet,

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:18.000
off the power of sun, wind and waves,

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:20.000
we are frantically digging

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:22.000
to get at the dirtiest,

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:25.000
highest-emitting stuff imaginable.

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:27.000
This is where our story of endless growth

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:29.000
has taken us,

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:32.000
to this black hole at the center of my country --

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:34.000
a place of such planetary pain

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:36.000
that, like the BP gusher,

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:40.000
one can only stand to look at it for so long.

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:43.000
As Jared Diamond and others have shown us,

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:46.000
this is how civilizations commit suicide,

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:49.000
by slamming their foot on the accelerator

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:51.000
at the exact moment

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:53.000
when they should be putting on the brakes.

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:56.000
The problem is that our master-narrative

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:58.000
has an answer for that too.

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:01.000
At the very last minute, we are going to get saved

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:03.000
just like in every Hollywood movie,

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:06.000
just like in the Rapture.

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:09.000
But, of course, our secular religion is technology.

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:11.000
Now, you may have noticed

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:14.000
more and more headlines like these.

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:17.000
The idea behind this form of "geoengineering" as it's called,

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:19.000
is that, as the planet heats up,

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:22.000
we may be able to shoot sulfates and aluminum particles

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:24.000
into the stratosphere

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:26.000
to reflect some of the sun's rays

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:28.000
back to space,

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:31.000
thereby cooling the planet.

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:33.000
The wackiest plan -- and I'm not making this up --

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:36.000
would put what is essentially a garden hose

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:39.000
18-and-a-half miles high into the sky,

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:41.000
suspended by balloons,

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:43.000
to spew sulfur dioxide.

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:46.000
So, solving the problem of pollution with more pollution.

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:49.000
Think of it as the ultimate junk shot.

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:52.000
The serious scientists involved in this research

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:54.000
all stress that these techniques

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:56.000
are entirely untested.

00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:58.000
They don't know if they'll work,

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:00.000
and they have no idea

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:03.000
what kind of terrifying side effects they could unleash.

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:06.000
Nevertheless, the mere mention of geoengineering

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:08.000
is being greeted in some circles,

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:10.000
particularly media circles,

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:12.000
with a relief tinged with euphoria.

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:14.000
An escape hatch has been reached.

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:16.000
A new frontier has been found.

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:18.000
Most importantly,

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:20.000
we don't have to change our lifestyles after all.

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:22.000
You see, for some people,

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:24.000
their savior is a guy in a flowing robe.

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:27.000
For other people, it's a guy with a garden hose.

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:31.000
We badly need some new stories.

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:34.000
We need stories that have different kinds of heroes

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:37.000
willing to take different kinds of risks --

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:39.000
risks that confront recklessness head on,

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:42.000
that put the precautionary principle into practice,

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:45.000
even if that means through direct action --

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:47.000
like hundreds of young people willing to get arrested,

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:49.000
blocking dirty power plants

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:52.000
or fighting mountaintop-removal coal mining.

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:54.000
We need stories

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:57.000
that replace that linear narrative of endless growth

00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:59.000
with circular narratives

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:01.000
that remind us

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:03.000
that what goes around comes around.

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:05.000
That this is our only home.

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:07.000
There is no escape hatch.

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:10.000
Call it karma, call it physics,

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:13.000
action and reaction, call it precaution --

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:15.000
the principle that reminds us

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:17.000
that life is too precious to be risked

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:19.000
for any profit.

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:21.000
Thank you.

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:28.000
(Applause)
