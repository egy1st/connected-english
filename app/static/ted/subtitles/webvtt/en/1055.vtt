00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
You may not know this,

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
but you are celebrating an anniversary with me.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
I'm not married,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
but one year ago today,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
I woke up

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
from a month-long coma,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
following a double lung transplant.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Crazy, I know. Insane.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Thank you.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Six years before that,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
I was starting my career

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
as an opera singer in Europe,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
when I was diagnosed with

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
idiopathic pulmonary hypertension --

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
also known as PH.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
It happens when there's a thickening

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
in the pulmonary veins,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
making the right side of the heart

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
work overtime,

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
and causing what I call

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
the reverse-Grinch effect.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
My heart was three-and-a-half sizes

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
too big.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
Physical activity becomes very difficult

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
for people with this condition,

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
and usually after two to five years,

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
you die.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
I went to see this specialist,

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
and she was top-of-the-field

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
and told me I had to stop singing.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
She said, "Those high notes are going to kill you."

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
While she didn't have any medical evidence

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
to back up her claim

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
that there was a relationship

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
between operatic arias

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
and pulmonary hypertension,

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
she was absolutely emphatic

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
I was singing my own obituary.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
I was very limited by my condition, physically.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
But I was not limited when I sang,

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
and as air came up from my lungs,

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
through my vocal cords

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
and passed my lips as sound,

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
it was the closest thing I had ever come

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
to transcendence.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
And just because of someone's hunch,

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
I wasn't going to give it up.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
Thankfully, I met Reda Girgis,

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
who is dry as toast,

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000
but he and his team at Johns Hopkins

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
didn't just want me to survive,

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
they wanted me

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
to live a meaningful life.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
This meant making trade-offs.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
I come from Colorado.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
It's a mile high,

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000
and I grew up there with my 10 brothers and sisters

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
and two adoring parents.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
Well, the altitude exacerbated my symptoms.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
So I moved to Baltimore to be near my doctors

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000
and enrolled in a conservatory nearby.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
I couldn't walk as much as I used to,

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000
so I opted for five-inch heels.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
And I gave up salt,

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
I went vegan,

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000
and I started taking huge doses of

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
sildenafil,

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
also known as Viagra.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.000
(Laughter)

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
My father and my grandfather were always looking for the newest thing

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000
in alternative or traditional therapies

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000
for PH,

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
but after six months,

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000
I couldn't walk up a small hill. I couldn't climb a flight of stairs.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
I could barely stand up

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
without feeling like I was going to faint.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000
I had a heart catheterization,

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000
where they measure this internal arterial pulmonary pressure,

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000
which is supposed to be between 15 and 20.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000
Mine was 146.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
I like to do things big,

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
and it meant one thing:

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000
there is a big gun treatment

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.000
for pulmonary hypertension called Flolan,

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000
and it's not just a drug;

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000
it's a way of life.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.000
Doctors insert a catheter into your chest,

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000
which is attached to a pump

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.000
that weighs about four-and-a-half pounds.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.000
Every day, 24 hours, that pump is at your side,

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000
administering medicine

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.000
directly to your heart,

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000
and it's not

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000
a particularly preferable

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000
medicine in many senses.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.000
This is a list of the side effects:

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.000
if you eat too much salt,

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000
like a peanut butter and jelly sandwich,

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.000
you'll probably end up in the ICU.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000
If you go through a metal detector,

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000
you'll probably die.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.000
If you get a bubble in your medicine --

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.000
because you have to mix it every morning --

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000
and it stays in there,

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000
you probably die.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.000
If you run out of medicine, you definitely die.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000
No one wants to go on Flolan.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.000
But when I needed it,

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.000
it was a godsend.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.000
Within a few days, I could walk again.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.000
Within a few weeks, I was performing,

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000
and in a few months,

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.000
I debuted at the Kennedy Center.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.000
The pump was a little bit problematic when performing,

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000
so I'd attach it to my inner thigh

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.000
with the help of the girdle and an ACE bandage.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000
Literally hundreds of elevator rides

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000
were spent with me alone

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.000
stuffing the pump into my Spanx,

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.000
hoping the doors wouldn't open unexpectedly.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.000
And the tubing coming out of my chest

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.000
was a nightmare for costume designers.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.000
I graduated from graduate school in 2006,

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.000
and I got a fellowship to go back to Europe.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000
A few days after arriving,

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000
I met this wonderful, old conductor

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000
who started casting me in all of these roles.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.000
And before long, I was commuting

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.000
between Budapest, Milan

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000
and Florence.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000
Though I was attached

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000
to this ugly, unwanted,

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000
high-maintenance, mechanical pet,

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.000
my life was kind of like the happy part in an opera --

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.000
very complicated,

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000
but in a good way.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.000
Then in February

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.000
of 2008,

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000
my grandfather passed away.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.000
He was a big figure in all of our lives,

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.000
and we loved him very much.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000
It certainly didn't prepare me

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000
for what came next.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.000
Seven weeks later,

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.000
I got a call from my family.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:16.000
My father had been in a catastrophic car accident,

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.000
and he died.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.000
At 24, my death would have been

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.000
entirely expected.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.000
But his --

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.000
well, the only way I can articulate how it felt

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000
was that it precipitated

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.000
my medical decline.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.000
Against my doctors' and family's wishes,

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.000
I needed to go back for the funeral.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000
I had to say goodbye

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.000
in some way, shape or form.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.000
But soon I was showing signs of right-heart failure,

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.000
and I had to return to sea level,

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.000
doing so knowing

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:55.000
that I probably would never see my home again.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.000
I canceled most of my engagements that summer,

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.000
but I had one left in Tel Aviv, so I went.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.000
After one performance,

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.000
I could barely drag myself

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.000
from the stage to the taxicab.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.000
I sat down and felt the blood

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.000
rush down from my face,

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.000
and in the heat of the desert,

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.000
I was freezing cold.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.000
My fingers started turning blue,

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:25.000
and I was like, "What is going on here?"

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.000
I heard my heart's valves

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000
snapping open and closed.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000
The cab stopped,

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.000
and I pulled my body from it

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.000
feeling each ounce of weight

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.000
as I walked to the elevator.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.000
I fell through my apartment door

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.000
and crawled to the bathroom

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.000
where I found my problem:

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.000
I had forgotten to mix in

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.000
the most important part of my medicine.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.000
I was dying,

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.000
and if I didn't mix that stuff up fast,

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:54.000
I would never leave that apartment alive.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.000
I started mixing,

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:59.000
and I felt like everything was going to fall out through one hole or another,

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.000
but I just kept on going.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.000
Finally, with the last bottle in and the last bubble out,

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.000
I attached the pump to the tubing

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.000
and lay there hoping it would kick in

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:10.000
soon enough.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000
If it didn't, I'd probably see my father

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.000
sooner than I anticipated.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:17.000
Thankfully, in a few minutes,

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:20.000
I saw the signature hive-like rash

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.000
appear on my legs,

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.000
which is a side effect of the medication,

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000
and I knew I'd be okay.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:29.000
We're not big on fear in my family,

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000
but I was scared.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.000
I went back to the States,

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.000
anticipating I'd return to Europe,

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.000
but the heart catheterization

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:40.000
showed that I wasn't going anywhere

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000
further that a flight-for-life from Johns Hopkins Hospital.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.000
I performed here and there,

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000
but as my condition deteriorated,

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.000
so did my voice.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.000
My doctor wanted me to get on the list for a lung transplant.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.000
I didn't.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:56.000
I had two friends who had recently died

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:59.000
months after having very challenging surgeries.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:02.000
I knew another young man, though, who had PH

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000
who died while waiting for one.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.000
I wanted to live.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.000
I thought stem cells were a good option,

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.000
but they hadn't developed to a point

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:13.000
where I could take advantage of them yet.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.000
I officially took a break from singing,

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.000
and I went to the Cleveland Clinic

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.000
to be reevaluated

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:23.000
for the third time in five years, for transplant.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:26.000
I was sitting there kind of unenthusiastically talking

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:29.000
with the head transplant surgeon,

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:32.000
and I asked him if I needed a transplant,

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.000
what I could do to prepare.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.000
He said, "Be happy.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.000
A happy patient

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:41.000
is a healthy patient."

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.000
It was like in one verbal swoop

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.000
he had channeled my thoughts

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.000
on life and medicine

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.000
and Confucius.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:52.000
I still didn't want a transplant,

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.000
but in a month,

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.000
I was back in the hospital

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:59.000
with some severely edemic kankles --

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:02.000
very attractive.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:05.000
And it was right-heart failure.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.000
I finally decided

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:11.000
it was time to take my doctor's advice.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:15.000
It was time for me to go to Cleveland

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:18.000
and to start the agonizing wait

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.000
for a match.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.000
But the next morning,

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.000
while I was still in the hospital,

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.000
I got a telephone call.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.000
It was my doctor in Cleveland,

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.000
Marie Budev.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:33.000
And they had lungs.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.000
It was a match.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.000
They were from Texas.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:40.000
And everybody was really happy for me,

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.000
but me.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.000
Because, despite their problems,

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:47.000
I had spent my whole life training my lungs,

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.000
and I was not particularly enthusiastic

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.000
about giving them up.

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:54.000
I flew to Cleveland,

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.000
and my family rushed there

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.000
in hopes that they would meet me

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.000
and say what we knew

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.000
might be our final goodbye.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:05.000
But organs don't wait,

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:07.000
and I went into surgery

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:11.000
before I could say goodbye.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.000
The last thing I remember

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:16.000
was lying on a white blanket,

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:19.000
telling my surgeon that I needed to see my mother again,

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:22.000
and to please try and save my voice.

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:26.000
I fell into this apocalyptic dream world.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.000
During the thirteen-and-a-half-hour surgery,

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:31.000
I flatlined twice,

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:34.000
40 quarts of blood

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.000
were infused into my body.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:39.000
And in my surgeon's 20-year career,

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:42.000
he said it was among the most difficult transplants

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:45.000
that he's ever performed.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:48.000
They left my chest open for two weeks.

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:51.000
You could see my over-sized heart

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.000
beating inside of it.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.000
I was on a dozen machines

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:57.000
that were keeping me alive.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:00.000
An infection ravaged my skin.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:08.000
I had hoped my voice would be saved,

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.000
but my doctors knew

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.000
that the breathing tubes going down my throat

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.000
might have already destroyed it.

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:17.000
If they stayed in, there was no way I would ever sing again.

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:20.000
So my doctor got the ENT,

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:23.000
the top guy at the clinic, to come down

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:25.000
and give me surgery

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:28.000
to move the tubes around my voice box.

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:31.000
He said it would kill me.

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:33.000
So my own surgeon performed the procedure

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:36.000
in a last-ditch attempt to save my voice.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.000
Though my mom couldn't say goodbye to me

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.000
before the surgery,

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:43.000
she didn't leave my side

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:46.000
in the months of recovery that followed.

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.000
And if you want an example

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.000
of perseverance,

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:52.000
grit and strength

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:55.000
in a beautiful, little package,

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.000
it is her.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.000
One year ago

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:05.000
to this very day,

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:07.000
I woke up.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:09.000
I was 95 lbs.

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:11.000
There were a dozen tubes

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:13.000
coming in and out of my body.

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:15.000
I couldn't walk, I couldn't talk,

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:17.000
I couldn't eat, I couldn't move,

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:19.000
I certainly couldn't sing,

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:21.000
I couldn't even breathe,

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:25.000
but when I looked up

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:28.000
and I saw my mother,

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:31.000
I couldn't help but smile.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:35.000
Whether by a Mack truck

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:37.000
or by heart failure

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:39.000
or faulty lungs,

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:41.000
death happens.

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:45.000
But life isn't really just about avoiding death, is it?

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:48.000
It's about living.

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:51.000
Medical conditions don't negate the human condition.

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:54.000
And when people are allowed

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.000
to pursue their passions,

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:58.000
doctors will find they have better,

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:00.000
happier and healthier patients.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:03.000
My parents were totally stressed out

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:05.000
about me going and auditioning

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:08.000
and traveling and performing all over the place,

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:10.000
but they knew that it was much better for me to do that

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:13.000
than be preoccupied with my own mortality all of the time.

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.000
And I'm so grateful they did.

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:19.000
This past summer, when I was running and singing

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:22.000
and dancing and playing with my nieces and my nephews

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:25.000
and my brothers and my sisters and my mother and my grandmother

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:27.000
in the Colorado Rockies,

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:29.000
I couldn't help but think of that doctor

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:32.000
who told me that I couldn't sing.

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.000
And I wanted to tell her,

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:37.000
and I want to tell you,

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:40.000
we need to stop letting disease

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:43.000
divorce us from our dreams.

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:45.000
When we do,

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:47.000
we will find that patients

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:50.000
don't just survive;

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:53.000
we thrive.

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:55.000
And some of us

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:58.000
might even sing.

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:02.000
(Applause)

00:15:02.000 --> 00:17:21.000
[Singing: French]

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:24.000
Thank you.

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:30.000
(Applause)

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:32.000
Thank you.

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:35.000
And I'd like to thank my pianist, Monica Lee.

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:40.000
(Applause)

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:42.000
Thank you so much.

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:44.000
Thank you.
