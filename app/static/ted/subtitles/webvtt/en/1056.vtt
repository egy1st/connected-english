WEBVTT

00:00:04.976 --> 00:00:06.364
I am honored to be here,

00:00:06.388 --> 00:00:08.365
and I'm honored to talk about this topic,

00:00:08.389 --> 00:00:10.214
which I think is of grave importance.

00:00:10.238 --> 00:00:11.461
We've been talking a lot

00:00:11.485 --> 00:00:17.428
about the horrific impacts of plastic
on the planet and on other species,

00:00:17.452 --> 00:00:19.460
but plastic hurts people, too --

00:00:19.951 --> 00:00:21.333
especially poor people.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.158
And both in the production of plastic,

00:00:25.182 --> 00:00:27.900
the use of plastic
and the disposal of plastic,

00:00:27.924 --> 00:00:30.489
the people who have
the bull's-eye on their foreheads

00:00:30.513 --> 00:00:32.203
are poor people.

00:00:32.227 --> 00:00:35.304
People got very upset

00:00:35.328 --> 00:00:38.407
when the BP oil spill happened,

00:00:38.431 --> 00:00:39.891
for very good reason.

00:00:39.915 --> 00:00:41.539
People thought, "Oh, my God.

00:00:41.563 --> 00:00:44.339
This is terrible, this oil --
it's in the water.

00:00:44.363 --> 00:00:48.281
It's going to destroy
the living systems there.

00:00:48.305 --> 00:00:49.739
People are going to be hurt.

00:00:49.763 --> 00:00:51.254
This is a terrible thing,

00:00:51.278 --> 00:00:53.613
this oil is going to hurt
the people in the Gulf."

00:00:53.637 --> 00:00:55.707
What people don't think about is:

00:00:55.731 --> 00:00:57.890
What if the oil had made it
safely to shore?

00:00:58.484 --> 00:01:01.175
What if the oil actually got
where it was trying to go?

00:01:01.814 --> 00:01:05.811
Not only would it have been burned
in engines and added to global warming,

00:01:05.835 --> 00:01:09.196
but there's a place called "Cancer Alley,"

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:11.355
and the reason it's called "Cancer Alley"

00:01:11.379 --> 00:01:14.007
is because the petrochemical industry

00:01:14.031 --> 00:01:16.187
takes that oil and turns it into plastic

00:01:16.211 --> 00:01:18.391
and in the process, kills people.

00:01:18.914 --> 00:01:21.962
It shortens the lives of the people
who live there in the Gulf.

00:01:21.986 --> 00:01:25.780
So oil and petrochemicals are not
just a problem when there's a spill;

00:01:25.804 --> 00:01:27.514
they're a problem when there's not.

00:01:27.538 --> 00:01:29.945
And what we don't often appreciate

00:01:29.969 --> 00:01:31.643
is the price that poor people pay

00:01:31.667 --> 00:01:33.778
for us to have these disposable products.

00:01:34.193 --> 00:01:36.338
The other thing
we often don't appreciate is,

00:01:36.362 --> 00:01:39.462
it's not just at the point of production
that poor people suffer.

00:01:39.486 --> 00:01:41.659
Poor people also suffer
at the point of use.

00:01:42.136 --> 00:01:44.221
Those of us who earn
a certain income level,

00:01:44.245 --> 00:01:46.186
we have something called choice.

00:01:46.671 --> 00:01:49.136
The reason why you want
to work hard and have a job

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:50.831
and not be poor and broke

00:01:50.855 --> 00:01:53.296
is so you can have choices,
economic choices.

00:01:53.692 --> 00:01:57.777
We actually get a chance
to choose not to use products

00:01:57.801 --> 00:02:00.018
that have dangerous,
poisonous plastic in them.

00:02:00.042 --> 00:02:02.577
Other people who are poor
don't have those choices.

00:02:02.601 --> 00:02:04.575
So low-income people often are the ones

00:02:04.599 --> 00:02:08.583
who are buying the products that have
those dangerous chemicals in them

00:02:08.607 --> 00:02:10.046
that their children are using.

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:13.894
Those are the people who wind up
ingesting a disproportionate amount

00:02:13.918 --> 00:02:16.085
of this poisonous plastic in using it.

00:02:16.109 --> 00:02:19.342
And people say, "Well, they should
just buy a different product."

00:02:19.366 --> 00:02:22.501
Well, the problem with being poor
is you don't have those choices.

00:02:22.525 --> 00:02:24.613
You often have to buy
the cheapest products.

00:02:24.637 --> 00:02:27.616
The cheapest products
are often the most dangerous.

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:29.236
And if that weren't bad enough --

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:32.681
if it wasn't just the production
of plastic that's giving people cancer

00:02:32.705 --> 00:02:34.209
in places like Cancer Alley,

00:02:34.233 --> 00:02:37.741
and shortening lives and hurting
poor kids at the point of use --

00:02:37.765 --> 00:02:39.848
at the point of disposal,

00:02:39.872 --> 00:02:43.130
once again, it's poor people
who bear the burden.

00:02:43.502 --> 00:02:46.107
Often, we think we're doing a good thing:

00:02:46.131 --> 00:02:49.779
You're in your office, drinking
your bottled water or whatever it is,

00:02:49.803 --> 00:02:52.562
and you think to yourself,
"I'm going to throw this away.

00:02:52.586 --> 00:02:56.116
No -- I'm going to be virtuous.
I'm going to put it in the blue bin."

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:58.172
You think, "I put mine in the blue bin."

00:02:58.196 --> 00:03:01.760
And then you look
at your colleague and say,

00:03:01.784 --> 00:03:04.898
"Why, you cretin!
You put yours in the white bin."

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:07.546
And we use that as a moral tickle.

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:09.315
We feel so good about ourselves.

00:03:09.339 --> 00:03:12.594
If we -- well, OK, I'm just ... me.

00:03:12.618 --> 00:03:14.318
Not you, but I feel this way often.

00:03:14.342 --> 00:03:15.976
(Laughter)

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.891
And so we kind of have
this moral feel-good moment.

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:22.126
But if we were to be able
to follow that little bottle

00:03:22.716 --> 00:03:24.181
on its journey,

00:03:24.205 --> 00:03:26.770
we would be shocked
to discover that, all too often,

00:03:26.794 --> 00:03:29.124
that bottle is going to be put on a boat,

00:03:30.049 --> 00:03:32.226
it's going to go all the way
across the ocean

00:03:32.886 --> 00:03:34.202
at some expense,

00:03:34.226 --> 00:03:37.745
and it's going to wind up
in a developing country, often China.

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:39.357
I think in our minds, we imagine

00:03:39.381 --> 00:03:41.841
somebody's going to take
the little bottle and say,

00:03:41.865 --> 00:03:45.126
"Oh, little bottle! We're so happy
to see you, little bottle."

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:46.976
(Laughter)

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.364
"You've served so well."

00:03:49.388 --> 00:03:50.411
(Laughter)

00:03:50.435 --> 00:03:52.276
He's given a little bottle massage,

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:53.976
a little bottle medal.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.198
And they say, "What would
you like to do next?"

00:03:56.222 --> 00:03:58.570
The little bottle says,
"I just don't know ..."

00:03:58.594 --> 00:03:59.920
(Laughter)

00:03:59.944 --> 00:04:02.007
But that's not actually what happens.

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:04.240
You know?

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:08.250
That bottle winds up getting burned.

00:04:09.417 --> 00:04:13.039
The recycling of plastic
in many developing countries

00:04:13.063 --> 00:04:16.213
means the incineration of the plastic,
the burning of the plastic,

00:04:16.237 --> 00:04:18.663
which releases incredible toxic chemicals

00:04:18.687 --> 00:04:20.520
and, once again, kills people.

00:04:20.544 --> 00:04:24.264
And so, poor people
who are making these products

00:04:24.288 --> 00:04:27.050
in petrochemical centers
like Cancer Alley,

00:04:27.074 --> 00:04:30.152
poor people who are consuming
these products disproportionately,

00:04:30.176 --> 00:04:33.690
and then poor people who,
even at the tail end of the recycling,

00:04:33.714 --> 00:04:35.476
are having their lives shortened.

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:39.096
They're all being harmed -- greatly --

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:43.607
by this addiction that we have
to disposability.

00:04:43.984 --> 00:04:46.466
Now, you think to yourself --
I know how you are --

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:49.960
you say, "That sure is terrible
for those poor people.

00:04:51.278 --> 00:04:54.166
It's just awful. Those poor people.

00:04:54.816 --> 00:04:56.947
I hope someone does
something to help them."

00:04:57.602 --> 00:04:59.328
But what we don't understand is --

00:05:00.765 --> 00:05:02.566
here we are in Los Angeles.

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:04.721
We worked very hard
to get the smog reduction

00:05:04.745 --> 00:05:06.300
happening here in Los Angeles.

00:05:06.324 --> 00:05:07.555
But guess what?

00:05:07.579 --> 00:05:10.934
Because they're doing so much
dirty production in Asia now,

00:05:10.958 --> 00:05:14.566
because the environmental laws
don't protect the people in Asia now,

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:18.632
almost all of the clean air gains
and the toxic air gains

00:05:18.656 --> 00:05:20.528
that we've achieved here in California

00:05:20.552 --> 00:05:23.468
have been wiped out
by dirty air coming over from Asia.

00:05:24.671 --> 00:05:27.377
So we all are being hit.
We all are being impacted.

00:05:27.401 --> 00:05:30.155
It's just that the poor people
get it first and worst.

00:05:30.179 --> 00:05:33.370
But the dirty production,
the burning of toxins,

00:05:33.394 --> 00:05:35.654
the lack of environmental
standards in Asia,

00:05:35.678 --> 00:05:38.171
is actually creating so much
dirty air pollution,

00:05:38.195 --> 00:05:39.612
it's coming across the ocean,

00:05:39.636 --> 00:05:41.750
and has erased our gains
here in California.

00:05:41.774 --> 00:05:43.668
We're back where we were in the 1970s.

00:05:43.692 --> 00:05:45.619
And so we're on one planet,

00:05:45.643 --> 00:05:48.588
and we have to be able to get
to the root of these problems.

00:05:48.612 --> 00:05:51.670
The root of this problem, in my view,

00:05:51.694 --> 00:05:54.199
is the idea of disposability itself.

00:05:54.738 --> 00:05:57.759
You see, if you understand the link

00:05:57.783 --> 00:06:01.511
between what we're doing
to poison and pollute the planet

00:06:01.535 --> 00:06:03.976
and what we're doing to poor people,

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.134
you arrive at a very troubling
but also very helpful insight:

00:06:09.036 --> 00:06:11.284
In order to trash the planet,

00:06:11.308 --> 00:06:12.975
you have to trash people.

00:06:13.523 --> 00:06:16.463
But if you create a world
where you don't trash people,

00:06:16.487 --> 00:06:17.976
you can't trash the planet.

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:20.766
So now we are at a moment

00:06:20.790 --> 00:06:23.638
where the coming together
of social justice as an idea

00:06:23.662 --> 00:06:25.276
and ecology as an idea,

00:06:26.111 --> 00:06:27.396
we finally can now see

00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:29.985
that they are really,
at the end of the day, one idea.

00:06:30.009 --> 00:06:32.896
And it's the idea that we don't have
disposable anything.

00:06:33.205 --> 00:06:35.805
We don't have disposable resources.

00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:38.931
We don't have disposable species.

00:06:38.955 --> 00:06:41.511
And we don't have
disposable people, either.

00:06:41.535 --> 00:06:43.557
We don't have a throwaway planet,

00:06:43.581 --> 00:06:46.372
and we don't have throwaway
children -- it's all precious.

00:06:46.396 --> 00:06:49.276
And as we all begin to come back
to that basic understanding,

00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:52.276
new opportunities for action
begin to emerge.

00:06:52.895 --> 00:06:54.566
Biomimicry,

00:06:54.590 --> 00:06:58.107
which is an emerging science,

00:06:58.131 --> 00:07:01.276
winds up being a very important
social justice idea.

00:07:01.736 --> 00:07:03.928
People who are just
learning about this stuff:

00:07:03.952 --> 00:07:07.538
biomimicry means respecting
the wisdom of all species.

00:07:07.951 --> 00:07:09.115
Democracy, by the way,

00:07:09.139 --> 00:07:12.146
means respecting the wisdom
of all people -- we'll get to that.

00:07:12.170 --> 00:07:14.956
But biomimicry means
respecting the wisdom of all species.

00:07:14.980 --> 00:07:17.490
It turns out we're a pretty
clever species.

00:07:17.514 --> 00:07:20.593
We have this big cortex,
we're pretty proud of ourselves.

00:07:20.617 --> 00:07:23.180
But if we want to make something hard,

00:07:23.204 --> 00:07:25.718
we say, "I know! I'm going
to make a hard substance.

00:07:25.742 --> 00:07:29.276
I know! I'm going to get
vacuums and furnaces

00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:30.984
and drag stuff out of the ground

00:07:31.008 --> 00:07:33.897
and get things hot
and poison and pollute ...

00:07:33.921 --> 00:07:36.142
But I got this hard thing!"

00:07:36.804 --> 00:07:37.954
(Laughter)

00:07:37.978 --> 00:07:39.577
"I'm so clever!"

00:07:39.601 --> 00:07:42.646
And you look behind you,
and there's destruction all around you.

00:07:42.670 --> 00:07:43.823
But guess what?

00:07:43.847 --> 00:07:46.393
You're so clever,
but you're not as clever as a clam.

00:07:46.704 --> 00:07:47.941
A clamshell is hard.

00:07:48.458 --> 00:07:51.129
There's no vacuums.
There's no big furnaces.

00:07:51.153 --> 00:07:53.093
There's no poison. There's no pollution.

00:07:53.117 --> 00:07:57.917
It turns out that other species
figured out a long time ago

00:07:57.941 --> 00:08:00.276
how to create many of the things we need

00:08:00.300 --> 00:08:03.276
using biological processes
that nature knows how to use well.

00:08:03.963 --> 00:08:07.638
That insight of biomimicry,
of our scientists finally realizing

00:08:07.662 --> 00:08:10.070
that we have as much
to learn from other species --

00:08:10.094 --> 00:08:13.276
I don't mean taking a mouse
and sticking it with stuff.

00:08:13.300 --> 00:08:16.609
I don't mean looking at it from that way,
abusing the little species.

00:08:16.633 --> 00:08:19.889
I mean actually respecting them,
respecting what they've achieved.

00:08:19.913 --> 00:08:21.470
That's called biomimicry,

00:08:21.494 --> 00:08:25.367
and that opens the door
to zero waste production;

00:08:25.391 --> 00:08:27.276
zero pollution production;

00:08:27.300 --> 00:08:29.276
that we could actually enjoy

00:08:29.300 --> 00:08:31.921
a high quality of life,
a high standard of living,

00:08:31.945 --> 00:08:33.516
without trashing the planet.

00:08:33.540 --> 00:08:36.580
Well, that idea of biomimicry,

00:08:36.604 --> 00:08:38.492
respecting the wisdom of all species,

00:08:38.966 --> 00:08:42.838
combined with the idea
of democracy and social justice,

00:08:42.862 --> 00:08:45.457
respecting the wisdom
and the worth of all people,

00:08:45.481 --> 00:08:47.276
would give us a different society.

00:08:47.300 --> 00:08:49.172
We would have a different economy.

00:08:49.196 --> 00:08:51.506
We would have a green society

00:08:51.530 --> 00:08:53.935
that Dr. King would be proud of.

00:08:53.959 --> 00:08:55.276
That should be the goal.

00:08:55.633 --> 00:08:58.601
And the way that we get there
is to first of all recognize

00:08:58.625 --> 00:09:00.709
that the idea of disposability

00:09:01.566 --> 00:09:05.676
not only hurts the species
we've talked about,

00:09:05.700 --> 00:09:08.451
but it even corrupts our own society.

00:09:08.475 --> 00:09:11.452
We're so proud to live here in California.

00:09:11.476 --> 00:09:13.562
We just had this vote,
and everybody's like,

00:09:13.586 --> 00:09:15.324
"Well -- not in our state!"

00:09:15.348 --> 00:09:16.869
(Laughter)

00:09:16.893 --> 00:09:19.676
I don't know what those
other states were doing, but ..."

00:09:19.700 --> 00:09:21.442
(Laughter)

00:09:21.466 --> 00:09:23.065
Just so proud.

00:09:24.061 --> 00:09:26.412
And, yeah, I'm proud, too.

00:09:26.436 --> 00:09:27.608
But ...

00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:32.676
California, though we lead the world
in some of the green stuff,

00:09:32.700 --> 00:09:34.676
we also, unfortunately, lead the world

00:09:34.700 --> 00:09:36.240
in some of the gulag stuff.

00:09:37.406 --> 00:09:40.946
California has one of the highest
incarceration rates

00:09:40.970 --> 00:09:42.676
of all the 50 states.

00:09:42.700 --> 00:09:44.936
We have a moral challenge
in this movement.

00:09:45.817 --> 00:09:50.837
We are passionate about rescuing
some dead materials from the landfill,

00:09:50.861 --> 00:09:52.677
but sometimes not as passionate

00:09:52.701 --> 00:09:55.019
about rescuing living beings,
living people.

00:09:55.414 --> 00:09:58.533
And I would say
that we live in a country --

00:09:58.557 --> 00:10:00.534
five percent of the world's population,

00:10:00.558 --> 00:10:02.424
25 percent of the greenhouse gases,

00:10:03.072 --> 00:10:05.307
but also 25 percent
of the world's prisoners.

00:10:06.084 --> 00:10:08.744
One of every four people
locked up anywhere in the world

00:10:08.768 --> 00:10:10.942
is locked up right here
in the United States.

00:10:10.966 --> 00:10:13.676
So that is consistent with this idea

00:10:13.700 --> 00:10:16.336
that disposability
is something we believe in.

00:10:16.916 --> 00:10:18.075
And yet,

00:10:19.240 --> 00:10:23.762
as a movement that has to broaden
its constituency,

00:10:23.786 --> 00:10:25.097
that has to grow,

00:10:25.121 --> 00:10:28.223
that has to reach out
beyond our natural comfort zone,

00:10:28.247 --> 00:10:31.160
one of the challenges
to the success of this movement,

00:10:31.184 --> 00:10:34.424
of getting rid of things like plastic
and helping the economy shift,

00:10:34.448 --> 00:10:37.395
is people look at our movement
with some suspicion.

00:10:37.864 --> 00:10:40.460
And they ask a question,
and the question is:

00:10:40.484 --> 00:10:42.451
How can these people be so passionate?

00:10:43.246 --> 00:10:46.485
A poor person, a low-income person,
somebody in Cancer Alley,

00:10:46.509 --> 00:10:48.943
somebody in Watts,

00:10:48.967 --> 00:10:51.676
somebody in Harlem,
somebody on an Indian reservation,

00:10:51.700 --> 00:10:53.918
might say to themselves --
and rightfully so --

00:10:53.942 --> 00:10:55.959
"How can these people be so passionate

00:10:56.848 --> 00:10:58.589
about making sure

00:10:58.613 --> 00:11:02.676
that a plastic bottle
has a second chance in life,

00:11:02.700 --> 00:11:05.443
or an aluminum can has a second chance,

00:11:05.911 --> 00:11:09.477
and yet, when my child gets in trouble
and goes to prison,

00:11:09.501 --> 00:11:11.310
he doesn't get a second chance?"

00:11:11.334 --> 00:11:13.816
"How can this movement
be so passionate about saying

00:11:13.840 --> 00:11:16.660
we don't have throwaway stuff,
no throwaway dead materials,

00:11:16.684 --> 00:11:19.499
and yet accept throwaway lives

00:11:19.523 --> 00:11:21.840
and throwaway communities
like Cancer Alley?"

00:11:21.864 --> 00:11:26.885
And so, we now get a chance
to be truly proud of this movement.

00:11:27.438 --> 00:11:29.125
When we take on topics like this,

00:11:29.149 --> 00:11:33.781
it gives us that extra call
to reach out to other movements

00:11:33.805 --> 00:11:36.147
and to become more inclusive and to grow,

00:11:36.171 --> 00:11:39.408
and we can finally get out of
this crazy dilemma that we've been in.

00:11:39.969 --> 00:11:42.080
Most of you are good, softhearted people.

00:11:43.389 --> 00:11:46.045
When you were younger,
you cared about the whole world,

00:11:46.069 --> 00:11:48.965
and at some point, somebody said
you had to pick an issue,

00:11:49.838 --> 00:11:51.909
you had to boil your love
down to an issue.

00:11:52.282 --> 00:11:53.805
"Can't love the whole world --

00:11:53.829 --> 00:11:57.423
you've got to work on trees
or you've got to work on immigration.

00:11:57.447 --> 00:12:00.351
You've got to shrink it down
and be about one issue."

00:12:00.375 --> 00:12:02.535
And really, they fundamentally told you,

00:12:03.319 --> 00:12:04.845
"Are you going to hug a tree?

00:12:05.453 --> 00:12:07.580
Or are you going to hug a child? Pick.

00:12:07.604 --> 00:12:09.216
Are you going to hug a tree?

00:12:09.240 --> 00:12:11.309
Or are you going to hug a child? Pick."

00:12:11.333 --> 00:12:13.785
Well, when you start working
on issues like plastic,

00:12:13.809 --> 00:12:16.008
you realize the whole thing is connected.

00:12:16.032 --> 00:12:18.812
And luckily, most of us are blessed
to have two arms --

00:12:18.836 --> 00:12:20.227
we can hug both.

00:12:20.251 --> 00:12:21.620
Thank you very much.

00:12:21.644 --> 00:12:28.555
(Applause)
