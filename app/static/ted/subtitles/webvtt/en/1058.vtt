00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Some of the greatest innovations

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
and developments in the world

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
often happen at the intersection of two fields.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
So tonight I'd like to tell you

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
about the intersection that I'm most excited about at this very moment,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
which is entertainment and robotics.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
So if we're trying to make robots

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
that can be more expressive

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
and that can connect better with us in society,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
maybe we should look to some of the human professionals

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
of artificial emotion and personality

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
that occur in the dramatic arts.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
I'm also interested in creating new technologies for the arts

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
and to attract people

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
to science and technology.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Some people in the last decade or two

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
have started creating artwork with technology.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
With my new venture, Marilyn Monrobot,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
I would like to use art to create tech.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
(Laughter)

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
So we're based in New York City.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
And if you're a performer that wants to collaborate

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
with an adorable robot,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
or if you have a robot that needs entertainment representation,

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
please contact me, the Bot-Agent.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
The bot, our rising celebrity,

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
also has his own Twitter account: @robotinthewild.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
I'd like to introduce you to one of our first robots, Data.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
He's named after the Star Trek character.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
I think he's going to be super popular.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
We've got the robot --

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
in his head is a database of a lot of jokes.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
Now each of these jokes is labeled with certain attributes.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
So it knows something about the subject; it knows about the length.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
It knows how much it's moving.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
And so it's going to try to watch your response.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
I actually have no idea what my robot is going to do today.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
(Laughter)

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
It can also learn from you

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
about the quality of its jokes

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
and cater things, sort of like Netflix-style,

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
over longer-term

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
to different communities or audiences,

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
children versus adults, different cultures.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
You can learn something from the robot

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
about the community that you're in.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
And also I can use each one of you as the acting coach

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
to our future robot companions.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
Some of you in this middle section --

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
you have red/green paddles.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
If you like what's going on,

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
show the green.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
If you don't like the subject or the performance,

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
you can hold the red.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
Now don't be shy.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
It's just a robot.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
It doesn't have feelings ... yet.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
(Laughter)

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
And the rest of you,

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
you still count, you still matter.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
There's also a microphone

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
that's listening to the aggregate laughter and applause

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000
and booing -- I hope not --

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000
to help make some of its next decisions.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000
Right, so,

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000
let the robot stand-up comedy begin.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000
Data: Hello TEDWomen.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
It's an honor to be here.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
(Laughter)

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:02.000
(Applause)

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000
You guys are looking good out there.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000
Ready for some jokes?

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
Audience: Yeah.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000
Data: Here's the first one.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
Right, so,

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
a doctor says to his patient,

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000
"I have bad news and worse news.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.000
The bad news is that you only have 24 hours to live."

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000
"That's terrible," said the patient.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
"How can the news possibly be worse?"

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000
"I've been trying to contact you since yesterday."

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000
(Laughter)

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000
(Applause)

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.000
The Swiss have an interesting army. Five hundred years without a war.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000
Heather Knight: He's talking about the Swiss.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000
Data: Pretty lucky for them.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000
Ever see that little Swiss Army knife

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.000
they have to fight with?

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.000
"Come on buddy, I have the toe clippers right here.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000
You get past me,

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000
the guy behind me has a spoon."

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000
(Laughter)

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000
HK: He's a French robot.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000
Data: A couple of New Jersey hunters are out in the woods.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000
One of them falls to the ground.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000
He does not seem to be breathing.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000
The other guy whips out his cell phone

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.000
and calls 911.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.000
He gasps to the operator, "My friend is dead.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000
What can I do?"

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000
The operator says, "Just take it easy.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000
I can help.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.000
First, let's make sure he's dead."

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000
There is a silence,

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000
and the operator hears a shot.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000
The guy's voice comes back on the line,

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.000
"Okay, now what?"

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000
(Laughter)

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000
(Applause)

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000
Question: Why is television called a medium?

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000
Anyone?

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.000
Because it's neither rare nor well done.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000
But to be completely honest with you,

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000
I kind of love television.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
Any of you like television? Audience: Yes.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.000
Data: I find it incredibly educational.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.000
Actually, as soon as someone turns it on,

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000
I go into the other room and read.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:05.000
(Laughter)

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000
That's all for now.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000
Was that okay for my first time?

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:18.000
(Applause)

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000
You've been a great audience.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000
Thank you.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000
HK: Yay.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.000
(Applause)

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000
So this is actually the first time

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000
we've ever done live audience feedback to a performance.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.000
So thank you all for being a part of it.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.000
There's a lot more to come.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000
And we hope to learn a lot about robot expression.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000
Thank you very much.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.000
(Applause)
