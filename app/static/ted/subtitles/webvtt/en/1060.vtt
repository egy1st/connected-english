00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
I'm going to be talking to you

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
about how we can tap

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
a really underutilized resource in health care,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
which is the patient,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
or, as I like to use the scientific term,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
people.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Because we are all patients, we are all people.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Even doctors are patients at some point.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
So I want to talk about that

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
as an opportunity

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
that we really have failed to engage with very well in this country

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
and, in fact, worldwide.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
If you want to get at the big part --

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
I mean from a public health level, where my training is --

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
you're looking at behavioral issues.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
You're looking at things where people are actually given information,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
and they're not following through with it.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
It's a problem that manifests itself in diabetes,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
obesity, many forms of heart disease,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
even some forms of cancer -- when you think of smoking.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
Those are all behaviors where people know what they're supposed to do.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
They know what they're supposed to be doing,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
but they're not doing it.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
Now behavior change is something

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
that is a long-standing problem in medicine.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
It goes all the way back to Aristotle.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
And doctors hate it, right?

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
I mean, they complain about it all the time.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
We talk about it in terms of engagement, or non-compliance.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
When people don't take their pills,

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
when people don't follow doctors' orders --

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
these are behavior problems.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
But for as much as clinical medicine

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
agonizes over behavior change,

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
there's not a lot of work done

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
in terms of trying to fix that problem.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
So the crux of it

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
comes down to this notion of decision-making --

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
giving information to people in a form

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
that doesn't just educate them

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
or inform them,

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
but actually leads them to make better decisions,

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
better choices in their lives.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
One part of medicine, though,

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.000
has faced the problem of behavior change pretty well,

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
and that's dentistry.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
Dentistry might seem -- and I think it is --

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
many dentists would have to acknowledge

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
it's somewhat of a mundane backwater of medicine.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
Not a lot of cool, sexy stuff happening in dentistry.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
But they have really taken this problem of behavior change

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
and solved it.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
It's the one great preventive health success

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
we have in our health care system.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
People brush and floss their teeth.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
They don't do it as much as they should, but they do it.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
So I'm going to talk about one experiment

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
that a few dentists in Connecticut

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
cooked up about 30 years ago.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
So this is an old experiment, but it's a really good one,

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
because it was very simple,

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
so it's an easy story to tell.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
So these Connecticut dentists decided

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
that they wanted to get people to brush their teeth and floss their teeth more often,

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
and they were going to use one variable:

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
they wanted to scare them.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000
They wanted to tell them how bad it would be

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
if they didn't brush and floss their teeth.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
They had a big patient population.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
They divided them up into two groups.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000
They had a low-fear population,

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
where they basically gave them a 13-minute presentation,

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
all based in science,

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000
but told them that, if you didn't brush and floss your teeth,

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000
you could get gum disease. If you get gum disease, you will lose your teeth,

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000
but you'll get dentures, and it won't be that bad.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
So that was the low-fear group.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
The high-fear group, they laid it on really thick.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
They showed bloody gums.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000
They showed puss oozing out from between their teeth.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
They told them that their teeth were going to fall out.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
They said that they could have infections

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
that would spread from their jaws to other parts of their bodies,

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
and ultimately, yes, they would lose their teeth.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000
They would get dentures, and if you got dentures,

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
you weren't going to be able to eat corn-on-the-cob,

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
you weren't going to be able to eat apples,

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
you weren't going to be able to eat steak.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
You'll eat mush for the rest of your life.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000
So go brush and floss your teeth.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
That was the message. That was the experiment.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
Now they measured one other variable.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
They wanted to capture one other variable,

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000
which was the patients' sense of efficacy.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000
This was the notion of whether the patients felt

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000
that they actually would go ahead and brush and floss their teeth.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000
So they asked them at the beginning,

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000
"Do you think you'll actually be able to stick with this program?"

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000
And the people who said, "Yeah, yeah. I'm pretty good about that,"

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000
they were characterized as high efficacy,

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000
and the people who said,

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000
"Eh, I never get around to brushing and flossing as much as I should,"

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000
they were characterized as low efficacy.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.000
So the upshot was this.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000
The upshot of this experiment

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
was that fear was not really a primary driver

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
of the behavior at all.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000
The people who brushed and flossed their teeth

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000
were not necessarily the people

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000
who were really scared about what would happen --

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.000
it's the people who simply felt that they had the capacity

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000
to change their behavior.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.000
So fear showed up as not really the driver.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.000
It was the sense of efficacy.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000
So I want to isolate this,

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000
because it was a great observation --

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.000
30 years ago, right, 30 years ago --

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.000
and it's one that's laid fallow in research.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
It was a notion that really came out

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
of Albert Bandura's work,

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000
who studied whether

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.000
people could get a sense of empowerment.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.000
The notion of efficacy basically boils down to one -- that

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.000
if somebody believes that they have the capacity to change their behavior.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.000
In health care terms, you could characterize this

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000
as whether or not somebody feels

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000
that they see a path towards better health,

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
that they can actually see their way towards getting better health,

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000
and that's a very important notion.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000
It's an amazing notion.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.000
We don't really know how to manipulate it, though, that well.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.000
Except, maybe we do.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000
So fear doesn't work, right? Fear doesn't work.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000
And this is a great example

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000
of how we haven't learned that lesson at all.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.000
This is a campaign from the American Diabetes Association.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.000
This is still the way we're communicating messages about health.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000
I mean, I showed my three-year-old this slide last night,

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:22.000
and he's like, "Papa, why is an ambulance in these people's homes?"

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.000
And I had to explain, "They're trying to scare people."

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000
And I don't know if it works.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000
Now here's what does work:

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000
personalized information works.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.000
Again, Bandura recognized this

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.000
years ago, decades ago.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000
When you give people specific information

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000
about their health, where they stand,

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000
and where they want to get to, where they might get to,

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000
that path, that notion of a path --

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000
that tends to work for behavior change.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000
So let me just spool it out a little bit.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.000
So you start with personalized data, personalized information

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000
that comes from an individual,

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.000
and then you need to connect it to their lives.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000
You need to connect it to their lives,

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.000
hopefully not in a fear-based way, but one that they understand.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.000
Okay, I know where I sit. I know where I'm situated.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.000
And that doesn't just work for me in terms of abstract numbers --

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000
this overload of health information

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.000
that we're inundated with.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.000
But it actually hits home.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.000
It's not just hitting us in our heads; it's hitting us in our hearts.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000
There's an emotional connection to information

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000
because it's from us.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.000
That information then needs to be connected to choices,

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000
needs to be connected to a range of options,

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000
directions that we might go to --

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000
trade-offs, benefits.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.000
Finally, we need to be presented with a clear point of action.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000
We need to connect the information

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.000
always with the action,

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.000
and then that action feeds back

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.000
into different information,

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000
and it creates, of course, a feedback loop.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.000
Now this is a very well-observed and well-established notion

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000
for behavior change.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.000
But the problem is that things -- in the upper-right corner there --

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000
personalized data, it's been pretty hard to come by.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:52.000
It's a difficult and expensive commodity,

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000
until now.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.000
So I'm going to give you an example, a very simple example of how this works.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.000
So we've all seen these. These are the "your speed limit" signs.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000
You've seen them all around,

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000
especially these days as radars are cheaper.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.000
And here's how they work in the feedback loop.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.000
So you start with the personalized data

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.000
where the speed limit on the road that you are at that point

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.000
is 25,

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.000
and, of course, you're going faster than that.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.000
We always are. We're always going above the speed limit.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.000
The choice in this case is pretty simple.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.000
We either keep going fast, or we slow down.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.000
We should probably slow down,

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.000
and that point of action is probably now.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:28.000
We should take our foot off the pedal right now,

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:31.000
and generally we do. These things are shown to be pretty effective

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.000
in terms of getting people to slow down.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.000
They reduce speeds by about five to 10 percent.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.000
They last for about five miles,

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.000
in which case we put our foot back on the pedal.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.000
But it works, and it even has some health repercussions.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.000
Your blood pressure might drop a little bit.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:46.000
Maybe there's fewer accidents, so there's public health benefits.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.000
But by and large, this is a feedback loop

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:51.000
that's so nifty and too rare.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.000
Because in health care, most health care,

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:56.000
the data is very removed from the action.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:59.000
It's very difficult to line things up so neatly.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.000
But we have an opportunity.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.000
So I want to talk about, I want to shift now to think about

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.000
how we deliver health information in this country,

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:08.000
how we actually get information.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:11.000
This is a pharmaceutical ad.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.000
Actually, it's a spoof. It's not a real pharmaceutical ad.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.000
Nobody's had the brilliant idea

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.000
of calling their drug Havidol quite yet.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.000
But it looks completely right.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.000
So it's exactly the way we get

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:26.000
health information and pharmaceutical information,

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000
and it just sounds perfect.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.000
And then we turn the page of the magazine,

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.000
and we see this --

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.000
now this is the page the FDA requires pharmaceutical companies

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.000
to put into their ads, or to follow their ads,

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:43.000
and to me, this is one of the most 
cynical exercises in medicine.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.000
Because we know.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.000
Who among us would actually say that people read this?

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.000
And who among us would actually say

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000
that people who do try to read this

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.000
actually get anything out of it?

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.000
This is a bankrupt effort

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:58.000
at communicating health information.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.000
There is no good faith in this.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000
So this is a different approach.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:05.000
This is an approach that has been developed

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:08.000
by a couple researchers at Dartmouth Medical School,

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.000
Lisa Schwartz and Steven Woloshin.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:13.000
And they created this thing called the "drug facts box."

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.000
They took inspiration from, of all things,

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.000
Cap'n Crunch.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:20.000
They went to the nutritional information box

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:23.000
and saw that what works for cereal, works for our food,

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:26.000
actually helps people understand what's in their food.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.000
God forbid we should use that same standard

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.000
that we make Cap'n Crunch live by

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:34.000
and bring it to drug companies.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.000
So let me just walk through this quickly.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.000
It says very clearly what the drug is for, specifically who it is good for,

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.000
so you can start to personalize your understanding

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.000
of whether the information is relevant to you

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.000
or whether the drug is relevant to you.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:48.000
You can understand exactly what the benefits are.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:51.000
It isn't this kind of vague promise that it's going to work no matter what,

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:54.000
but you get the statistics for how effective it is.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:57.000
And finally, you understand what those choices are.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.000
You can start to unpack the choices involved

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.000
because of the side effects.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:04.000
Every time you take a drug, you're walking into a possible side effect.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.000
So it spells those out in very clean terms,

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.000
and that works.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.000
So I love this. I love that drug facts box.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.000
And so I was thinking about,

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.000
what's an opportunity that I could have

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:17.000
to help people understand information?

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:21.000
What's another latent body of information that's out there

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:24.000
that people are really not putting to use?

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:27.000
And so I came up with this: lab test results.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:30.000
Blood test results are this great source of information.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.000
They're packed with information.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:35.000
They're just not for us. They're not for people. They're not for patients.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.000
They go right to doctors.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:40.000
And God forbid -- I think many doctors, if you really asked them,

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:43.000
they don't really understand all this stuff either.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:46.000
This is the worst presented information.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:49.000
You ask Tufte, and he would say,

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:52.000
"Yes, this is the absolute worst presentation of information possible."

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:54.000
What we did at Wired

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.000
was we went, and I got our graphic design department

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.000
to re-imagine these lab reports.

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.000
So that's what I want to walk you through.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:03.000
So this is the general blood work before,

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:05.000
and this is the after, this is what we came up with.

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:07.000
The after takes what was four pages --

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.000
that previous slide was actually

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.000
the first of four pages of data

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.000
that's just the general blood work.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:16.000
It goes on and on and on, all these values, all these numbers you don't know.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:19.000
This is our one-page summary.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.000
We use the notion of color.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:24.000
It's an amazing notion that color could be used.

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:27.000
So on the top-level you have your overall results,

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:30.000
the things that might jump out at you from the fine print.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.000
Then you can drill down

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:35.000
and understand how actually we put your level in context,

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:37.000
and we use color to illustrate

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.000
exactly where your value falls.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:42.000
In this case, this patient is slightly at risk of diabetes

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:44.000
because of their glucose level.

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:46.000
Likewise, you can go over your lipids

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:49.000
and, again, understand what your overall cholesterol level is

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:52.000
and then break down into the HDL and the LDL if you so choose.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.000
But again, always using color

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.000
and personalized proximity

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.000
to that information.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.000
All those other values,

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.000
all those pages and pages of values that are full of nothing,

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.000
we summarize.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.000
We tell you that you're okay, you're normal.

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:09.000
But you don't have to wade through it. You don't have to go through the junk.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:11.000
And then we do two other very important things

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.000
that kind of help fill in this feedback loop:

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:15.000
we help people understand in a little more detail

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:18.000
what these values are and what they might indicate.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:21.000
And then we go a further step -- we tell them what they can do.

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:23.000
We give them some insight

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:26.000
into what choices they can make, what actions they can take.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:29.000
So that's our general blood work test.

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:31.000
Then we went to CRP test.

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:33.000
In this case, it's a sin of omission.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:35.000
They have this huge amount of space,

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:37.000
and they don't use it for anything, so we do.

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.000
Now the CRP test is often done

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:41.000
following a cholesterol test,

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.000
or in conjunction with a cholesterol test.

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:45.000
So we take the bold step

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:48.000
of putting the cholesterol information on the same page,

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.000
which is the way the doctor is going to evaluate it.

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:53.000
So we thought the patient might actually want to know the context as well.

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.000
It's a protein that shows up

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.000
when your blood vessels might be inflamed,

00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:59.000
which might be a risk for heart disease.

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.000
What you're actually measuring

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:03.000
is spelled out in clean language.

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:05.000
Then we use the information

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:07.000
that's already in the lab report.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:09.000
We use the person's age and their gender

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:12.000
to start to fill in the personalized risks.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.000
So we start to use the data we have

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.000
to run a very simple calculation

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.000
that's on all sorts of online calculators

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:21.000
to get a sense of what the actual risk is.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.000
The last one I'll show you is a PSA test.

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:26.000
Here's the before, and here's the after.

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:28.000
Now a lot of our effort on this one --

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.000
as many of you probably know,

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.000
a PSA test is a very controversial test.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.000
It's used to test for prostate cancer,

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:36.000
but there are all sorts of reasons

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.000
why your prostate might be enlarged.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.000
And so we spent a good deal of our time

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:42.000
indicating that.

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.000
We again personalized the risks.

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:46.000
So this patient is in their 50s,

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.000
so we can actually give them a very precise estimate

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.000
of what their risk for prostate cancer is.

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:53.000
In this case it's about 25 percent, based on that.

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:56.000
And then again, the follow-up actions.

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:59.000
So our cost for this was less than 10,000 dollars, all right.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:02.000
That's what Wired magazine spent on this.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.000
Why is Wired magazine doing this?

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:07.000
(Laughter)

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:09.000
Quest Diagnostics and LabCorp,

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:12.000
the two largest lab testing companies --

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:15.000
last year, they made profits of over 700 million dollars

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:18.000
and over 500 million dollars respectively.

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:20.000
Now this is not a problem of resources;

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:23.000
this is a problem of incentives.

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:26.000
We need to recognize that the target of this information

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:29.000
should not be the doctor, should not be the insurance company.

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:31.000
It should be the patient.

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:33.000
It's the person who actually, in the end,

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:35.000
is going to be having to change their lives

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:37.000
and then start adopting new behaviors.

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.000
This is information that is incredibly powerful.

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:42.000
It's an incredibly powerful catalyst to change.

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:44.000
But we're not using it. It's just sitting there.

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.000
It's being lost.

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.000
So I want to just offer four questions

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:50.000
that every patient should ask,

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:52.000
because I don't actually expect people

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:54.000
to start developing these lab test reports.

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:56.000
But you can create your own feedback loop.

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:59.000
Anybody can create their feedback loop by asking these simple questions:

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:01.000
Can I have my results?

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.000
And the only acceptable answer is --

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:05.000
(Audience: Yes.) -- yes.

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:07.000
What does this mean? Help me understand what the data is.

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:10.000
What are my options? What choices are now on the table?

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:12.000
And then, what's next?

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:14.000
How do I integrate this information

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:16.000
into the longer course of my life?

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:19.000
So I want to wind up by just showing

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:21.000
that people have the capacity to understand this information.

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:24.000
This is not beyond the grasp of ordinary people.

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:27.000
You do not need to have the education level of people in this room.

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:30.000
Ordinary people are capable of understanding this information,

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:33.000
if we only go to the effort of presenting it to them

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:35.000
in a form that they can engage with.

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:37.000
And engagement is essential here,

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:39.000
because it's not just giving them information;

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:41.000
it's giving them an opportunity to act.

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:43.000
That's what engagement is. It's different from compliance.

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:46.000
It works totally different from the way we talk about behavior

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:48.000
in medicine today.

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:50.000
And this information is out there.

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:52.000
I've been talking today about latent information,

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:54.000
all this information that exists in the system

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:56.000
that we're not putting to use.

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:58.000
But there are all sorts of other bodies of information

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:00.000
that are coming online,

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:03.000
and we need to recognize the capacity of this information

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:05.000
to engage people, to help people

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:07.000
and to change the course of their lives.

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:09.000
Thank you very much.

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:12.000
