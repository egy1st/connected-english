00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:09.000
(Laughter)

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
I was afraid of womanhood.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Not that I'm not afraid now,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
but I've learned to pretend.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
I've learned to be flexible.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
In fact, I've developed some interesting tools

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
to help me deal with this fear.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Let me explain.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Back in the '50s and '60s, when I was growing up,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
little girls were supposed to be kind and thoughtful

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
and pretty and gentle and soft,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
and we were supposed to fit into roles

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
that were sort of shadowy --

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
really not quite clear what we were supposed to be.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000
(Laughter)

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
There were plenty of role models all around us.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
We had our mothers, our aunts, our cousins, our sisters,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
and of course, the ever-present media

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
bombarding us with images and words,

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
telling us how to be.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
Now my mother was different.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
She was a homemaker,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
but she and I didn't go out and do girlie things together,

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
and she didn't buy me pink outfits.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
Instead, she knew what I needed, and she bought me a book of cartoons.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
And I just ate it up.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
I drew, and I drew,

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
and since I knew that humor was acceptable in my family,

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
I could draw, do what I wanted to do,

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
and not have to perform, not have to speak --

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
I was very shy --

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
and I could still get approval.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
I was launched as a cartoonist.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
Now when we're young,

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
we don't always know. We know there are rules out there,

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
but we don't always know --

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
we don't perform them right,

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
even though we are imprinted at birth

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
with these things,

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
and we're told

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
what the most important color in the world is.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
We're told what shape we're supposed to be in.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
(Laughter)

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
We're told what to wear --

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
(Laughter)

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
-- and how to do our hair --

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:01.000
(Laughter)

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
-- and how to behave.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
Now the rules that I'm talking about

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
are constantly being monitored by the culture.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
We're being corrected,

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
and the primary policemen are women,

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
because we are the carriers of the tradition.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
We pass it down from generation to generation.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
Not only that --

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
we always have this vague notion

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
that something's expected of us.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000
And on top of all off these rules,

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
they keep changing.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.000
(Laughter)

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000
We don't know what's going on half the time,

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000
so it puts us in a very tenuous position.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
(Laughter)

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
Now if you don't like these rules,

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
and many of us don't --

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000
I know I didn't, and I still don't,

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
even though I follow them half the time,

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
not quite aware that I'm following them --

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000
what better way than to change them [than] with humor?

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000
Humor relies on the traditions of a society.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000
It takes what we know, and it twists it.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
It takes the codes of behavior and the codes of dress,

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
and it makes it unexpected,

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
and that's what elicits a laugh.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000
Now what if you put together women and humor?

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
I think you can get change.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
Because women are on the ground floor,

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
and we know the traditions so well,

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
we can bring a different voice to the table.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000
Now I started drawing

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000
in the middle of a lot of chaos.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
I grew up not far from here in Washington D.C.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
during the Civil Rights movement, the assassinations,

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000
the Watergate hearings and then the feminist movement,

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000
and I think I was drawing,

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000
trying to figure out what was going on.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.000
And then also my family was in chaos,

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.000
and I drew to try to bring my family together --

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:48.000
(Laughter)

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.000
-- try to bring my family together with laughter.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000
It didn't work.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.000
My parents got divorced, and my sister was arrested.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000
But I found my place.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000
I found that I didn't have to wear high heels,

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
I didn't have to wear pink,

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.000
and I could feel like I fit in.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.000
Now when I was a little older, in my 20s,

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.000
I realized there are not many women in cartooning.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000
And I thought, "Well, maybe I can break

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000
the little glass ceiling of cartooning,"

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000
and so I did. I became a cartoonist.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.000
And then I thought -- in my 40s I started thinking,

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000
"Well, why don't I do something?

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000
I always loved political cartoons,

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000
so why don't I do something with the content of my cartoons

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000
to make people think about the stupid rules that we're following

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000
as well as laugh?"

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000
Now my perspective

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000
is a particularly --

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000
(Laughter)

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000
-- my perspective is a particularly American perspective.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.000
I can't help it. I live here.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000
Even though I've traveled a lot,

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000
I still think like an American woman.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000
But I believe that the rules that I'm talking about

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
are universal, of course --

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.000
that each culture has its different codes of behavior

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000
and dress and traditions,

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000
and each woman has to deal with these same things

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000
that we do here in the U.S.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000
Consequently, we have.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000
Women, because we're on the ground, we know the tradition.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000
We have amazing antennae.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000
Now my work lately

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000
has been to collaborate with international cartoonists,

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000
which I so enjoy,

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000
and it's given me a greater appreciation

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000
for the power of cartoons

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:24.000
to get at the truth,

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.000
to get at the issues quickly and succinctly.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000
And not only that, it can get to the viewer

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.000
through not only the intellect, but through the heart.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.000
My work also has allowed me to collaborate

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000
with women cartoonists from across the world --

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000
countries such as Saudi Arabia,

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000
Iran, Turkey,

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000
Argentina, France --

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000
and we have sat together and laughed

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000
and talked and shared our difficulties.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.000
And these women are working so hard to get their voices heard

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.000
in some very difficult circumstances.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.000
But I feel blessed to be able to work with them.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.000
And we talk about

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000
how women have such strong perceptions,

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.000
because of our tenuous position

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.000
and our role as tradition-keepers,

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.000
that we can have the great potential

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.000
to be change-agents.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.000
And I think, I truly believe,

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.000
that we can change this thing

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.000
one laugh at a time.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000
Thank you.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000
(Applause)
