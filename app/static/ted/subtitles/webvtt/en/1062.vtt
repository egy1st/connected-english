00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
My story actually began when I was four years old

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
and my family moved to a new neighborhood

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
in our hometown of Savannah, Georgia.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
And this was the 1960s

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
when actually all the streets in this neighborhood

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
were named after Confederate war generals.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
We lived on Robert E. Lee Boulevard.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
And when I was five,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
my parents gave me an orange Schwinn Sting-Ray bicycle.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
It had a swooping banana seat and those ape hanger handlebars

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
that made the rider look like an orangutan.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
That's why they were called ape hangers.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
They were actually modeled on hotrod motorcycles of the 1960s,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
which I'm sure my mom didn't know.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
And one day I was exploring this cul-de-sac

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
hidden away a few streets away.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
And I came back,

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
and I wanted to turn around and get back to that street more quickly,

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
so I decided to turn around in this big street

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
that intersected our neighborhood,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
and wham! I was hit by a passing sedan.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
My mangled body flew in one direction,

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
my mangled bike flew in the other.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
And I lay on the pavement stretching over that yellow line,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
and one of my neighbors came running over.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
"Andy, Andy, how are you doing?" she said, using the name of my older brother.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
(Laughter)

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
"I'm Bruce," I said, and promptly passed out.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
I broke my left femur that day --

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
it's the largest bone in your body --

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
and spent the next two months in a body cast

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
that went from my chin to the tip of my toe

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
to my right knee,

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
and a steel bar went from my right knee

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
to my left ankle.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
And for the next 38 years,

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
that accident was the only medically interesting thing

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
that ever happened to me.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
In fact, I made a living by walking.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
I traveled around the world, entered different cultures,

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
wrote a series of books about my travels,

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
including "Walking the Bible."

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
I hosted a television show by that name

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
on PBS.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
I was, for all the world, the "walking guy."

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
Until, in May 2008,

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
a routine visit to my doctor

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
and a routine blood test

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
produced evidence in the form of an alkaline phosphatase number

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000
that something might be wrong with my bones.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
And my doctor, on a whim, sent me to get a full-body bone scan,

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
which showed that there was some growth in my left leg.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
That sent me to an X-ray, then to an MRI.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
And one afternoon, I got a call from my doctor.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
"The tumor in your leg

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
is not consistent with a benign tumor."

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
I stopped walking,

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000
and it took my mind a second to convert that double negative

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
into a much more horrifying negative.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
I have cancer.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
And to think that the tumor was in the same bone,

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
in the same place in my body

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000
as the accident 38 years earlier --

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000
it seemed like too much of a coincidence.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
So that afternoon, I went back to my house,

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
and my three year-old identical twin daughters, Eden and Tybee Feiler,

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
came running to meet me.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
They'd just turned three,

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
and they were into all things pink and purple.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
In fact, we called them Pinkalicious and Purplicious --

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
although I must say, our favorite nickname

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
occurred on their birthday, April 15th.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000
When they were born at 6:14 and 6:46

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000
on April 15, 2005,

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000
our otherwise grim, humorless doctor looked at his watch,

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000
and was like, "Hmm, April 15th -- tax day.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
Early filer and late filer."

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.000
(Laughter)

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000
The next day I came to see him. I was like, "Doctor, that was a really good joke."

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
And he was like, "You're the writer, kid."

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
Anyway -- so they had just turned three,

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000
and they came and they were doing this dance they had just made up

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.000
where they were twirling faster and faster until they tumbled to the ground,

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.000
laughing with all the glee in the world.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
I crumbled.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.000
I kept imagining all the walks I might not take with them,

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000
the art projects I might not mess up,

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000
the boyfriends I might not scowl at,

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.000
the aisles I might not walk down.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000
Would they wonder who I was, I thought.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000
Would they yearn for my approval,

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000
my love, my voice?

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000
A few days later, I woke with an idea

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000
of how I might give them that voice.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000
I would reach out to six men

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000
from all parts of my life

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000
and ask them to be present

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000
in the passages of my daughters' lives.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000
"I believe my girls will have plenty of opportunities in their lives,"

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000
I wrote these men.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000
"They'll have loving families and welcoming homes,

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000
but they may not have me.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000
They may not have their dad.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000
Will you help be their dad?"

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000
And I said to myself

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000
I would call this group of men "the Council of Dads."

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000
Now as soon as I had this idea,

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000
I decided I wouldn't tell my wife. Okay.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000
She's a very upbeat,

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
naturally excited person.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000
There's this idea in this culture -- I don't have to tell you --

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000
that you sort of "happy" your way through a problem.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000
We should focus on the positive.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000
My wife, as I said, she grew up outside of Boston.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000
She's got a big smile. She's got a big personality.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000
She's got big hair --

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.000
although, she told me recently, I can't say she has big hair,

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000
because if I say she has big hair,

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000
people will think she's from Texas.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000
And it's apparently okay to marry a boy from Georgia,

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.000
but not to have hair from Texas.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000
And actually, in her defense, if she were here right now,

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.000
she would point out that, when we got married in Georgia,

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000
there were three questions

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000
on the marriage certificate license,

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.000
the third of which was, "Are you related?"

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.000
(Laughter)

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000
I said, "Look, in Georgia at least we want to know.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.000
In Arkansas they don't even ask."

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000
What I didn't tell her is, if she said, "Yes," you could jump.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000
You don't need the 30-day waiting period.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.000
Because you don't need the get-to-know-you session at that point.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000
So I wasn't going to tell her about this idea,

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000
but the next day I couldn't control myself, I told her.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000
And she loved the idea,

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.000
but she quickly started rejecting my nominees.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000
She was like, "Well, I love him, but I would never ask him for advice."

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.000
So it turned out that starting a council of dads

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000
was a very efficient way to find out

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000
what my wife really thought of my friends.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000
(Laughter)

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000
So we decided that we needed a set of rules,

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000
and we came up with a number.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000
And the first one was no family, only friends.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.000
We thought our family would already be there.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000
Second, men only.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000
We were trying to fill the dad-space in the girls' lives.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.000
And then third, sort of a dad for every side.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000
We kind of went through my personality

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000
and tried to get a dad who represented each different thing.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000
So what happened was I wrote a letter to each of these men.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.000
And rather than send it,

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.000
I decided to read it to them in person.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.000
Linda, my wife, joked that it was like having six different marriage proposals.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.000
I sort of friend-married each of these guys.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000
And the first of these guys was Jeff Schumlin.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000
Now Jeff led this trip I took to Europe

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.000
when I graduated from high school in the early 1980s.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.000
And on that first day we were in this youth hostel in a castle.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.000
And I snuck out behind,

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:28.000
and there was a moat, a fence and a field of cows.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000
And Jeff came up beside me and said,

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000
"So, have you ever been cow tipping?"

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000
I was like, "Cow tipping?

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000
He was like, "Yeah. Cows sleep standing up.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.000
So if you approach them from behind, down wind,

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.000
you can push them over and they go thud in the mud."

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.000
So before I had a chance to determine whether this was right or not,

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.000
we had jumped the moat, we had climbed the fence,

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.000
we were tiptoeing through the dung

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.000
and approaching some poor, dozing cow.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000
So a few weeks after my diagnosis,

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000
we went up to Vermont,

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.000
and I decided to put Jeff as the first person in the Council of Dads.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.000
And we went to this apple orchard, and I read him this letter.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000
"Will you help be their dad?"

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.000
And I got to the end -- he was crying and I was crying --

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.000
and then he looked at me, and he said, "Yes."

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.000
I was like, "Yes?"

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.000
I kind of had forgotten there was a question at the heart of my letter.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.000
And frankly, although I keep getting asked this,

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.000
it never occurred to me that anybody would turn me down

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:19.000
under the circumstances.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:22.000
And then I asked him a question, which I ended up asking to all the dads

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:25.000
and ended up really encouraging me to write this story down in a book.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.000
And that was, "What's the one piece of advice

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000
you would give to my girls?"

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000
And Jeff's advice was,

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.000
"Be a traveller, not a tourist.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:36.000
Get off the bus. Seek out what's different.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.000
Approach the cow."

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.000
"So it's 10 years from now," I said,

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.000
"and my daughters are about to take their first trip abroad, and I'm not here.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.000
What would you tell them?"

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.000
He said, "I would approach this journey

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.000
as a young child might approach a mud puddle.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:52.000
You can bend over and look at your reflection in the mirror

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:55.000
and maybe run your finger and make a small ripple,

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.000
or you can jump in and thrash around

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:00.000
and see what it feels like, what it smells like."

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000
And as he talked he had that glint in his eye

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000
that I first saw back in Holland --

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.000
the glint that says, "Let's go cow tipping,"

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:09.000
even though we never did tip the cow,

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.000
even though no one tips the cow,

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:14.000
even though cows don't sleep standing up.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.000
He said, "I want to see you back here girls, at the end of this experience,

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.000
covered in mud."

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.000
Two weeks after my diagnosis, a biopsy confirmed

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.000
I had a seven-inch osteosarcoma

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.000
in my left femur.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:32.000
Six hundred Americans a year get an osteosarcoma.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.000
Eighty-five percent are under 21.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.000
Only a hundred adults a year

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.000
get one of these diseases.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:41.000
Twenty years ago, doctors would have cut off my leg and hoped,

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:44.000
and there was a 15 percent survival rate.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000
And then in the 1980's, they determined

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:49.000
that one particular cocktail of chemo could be effective,

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:52.000
and within weeks I had started that regimen.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.000
And since we are in a medical room,

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.000
I went through four and a half months of chemo.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.000
Actually I had Cisplatin, Doxorubicin

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:01.000
and very high-dose Methotrexate.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.000
And then I had a 15-hour surgery

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.000
in which my surgeon, Dr. John Healey

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.000
at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Hospital in New York,

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.000
took out my left femur

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.000
and replaced it with titanium.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.000
And if you did see the Sanjay special,

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.000
you saw these enormous screws

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.000
that they screwed into my pelvis.

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:21.000
Then he took my fibula from my calf,

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:24.000
cut it out and then relocated it to my thigh,

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.000
where it now lives.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:29.000
And what he actually did was he de-vascularized it from my calf

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.000
and re-vascularized it in my thigh

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.000
and then connected it

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:36.000
to the good parts of my knee and my hip.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.000
And then he took out a third of my quadriceps muscle.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.000
This is a surgery so rare

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:44.000
only two human beings have survived it before me.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.000
And my reward for surviving it

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:49.000
was to go back for four more months of chemo.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.000
It was, as we said in my house,

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.000
a lost year.

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:56.000
Because in those opening weeks, we all had nightmares.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.000
And one night I had a nightmare that I was walking through my house,

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:01.000
sat at my desk and saw photographs of someone else's children

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.000
sitting on my desk.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:06.000
And I remember a particular one night that, when you told that story of --

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.000
I don't know where you are Dr. Nuland --

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.000
of William Sloane Coffin --

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.000
it made me think of it.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:15.000
Because I was in the hospital after, I think it was my fourth round of chemo

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:18.000
when my numbers went to zero, and I had basically no immune system.

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:21.000
And they put me in an infectious disease ward at the hospital.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:24.000
And anybody who came to see me had to cover themselves in a mask

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:27.000
and cover all of the extraneous parts of their body.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.000
And one night I got a call from my mother-in-law

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.000
that my daughters, at that time three and a half,

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:35.000
were missing me and feeling my absence.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.000
And I hung up the phone,

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.000
and I put my face in my hands,

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:43.000
and I screamed this silent scream.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.000
And what you said, Dr. Nuland -- I don't know where you are --

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.000
made me think of this today.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.000
Because the thought that came to my mind

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.000
was that the feeling that I had

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:53.000
was like a primal scream.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.000
And what was so striking --

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:58.000
and one of the messages I want to leave you here with today --

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.000
is the experience.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:03.000
As I became less and less human --

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:06.000
and at this moment in my life, I was probably 30 pounds less than I am right now.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:09.000
Of course, I had no hair and no immune system.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:12.000
They were actually putting blood inside my body.

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.000
At that moment I was less and less human,

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.000
I was also, at the same time,

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:19.000
maybe the most human I've ever been.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:22.000
And what was so striking about that time

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.000
was, instead of repulsing people,

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.000
I was actually proving to be a magnet for people.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.000
People were incredibly drawn.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:31.000
When my wife and I had kids, we thought it would be all-hands-on-deck.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:33.000
Instead, it was everybody running the other way.

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:36.000
And when I had cancer, we thought it'd be everybody running the other way.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.000
Instead, it was all-hands-on-deck.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.000
And when people came to me,

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:42.000
rather than being incredibly turned off by what they saw --

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:44.000
I was like a living ghost --

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:46.000
they were incredibly moved

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:49.000
to talk about what was going on in their own lives.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:52.000
Cancer, I found, is a passport to intimacy.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.000
It is an invitation, maybe even a mandate,

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:57.000
to enter the most vital arenas of human life,

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.000
the most sensitive and the most frightening,

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.000
the ones that we never want to go to,

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.000
but when we do go there,

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:06.000
we feel incredibly transformed when we do.

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:09.000
And this also happened to my girls as they began to see,

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:12.000
and, we thought, maybe became an ounce more compassionate.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.000
One day, my daughter Tybee,

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:17.000
Tybee came to me, and she said, "I have so much love for you in my body, daddy,

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:19.000
I can't stop giving you hugs and kisses.

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:22.000
And when I have no more love left, I just drink milk,

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:24.000
because that's where love comes from."

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:26.000
(Laughter)

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.000
And one night my daughter Eden came to me.

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.000
And as I lifted my leg out of bed,

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:33.000
she reached for my crutches and handed them to me.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:35.000
In fact, if I cling to one memory of this year,

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:37.000
it would be walking down a darkened hallway

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.000
with five spongy fingers

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:41.000
grasping the handle underneath my hand.

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.000
I didn't need the crutch anymore,

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:45.000
I was walking on air.

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.000
And one of the profound things that happened

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:51.000
was this act of actually connecting to all these people.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.000
And it made me think -- and I'll just note for the record --

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.000
one word that I've only heard once actually

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:58.000
was when we were all doing Tony Robbins yoga yesterday --

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.000
the one word that has not been mentioned in this seminar actually

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.000
is the word "friend."

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:04.000
And yet from everything we've been talking about --

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:06.000
compliance, or addiction, or weight loss --

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.000
we now know that community is important,

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:11.000
and yet it's one thing we don't actually bring in.

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:13.000
And there was something incredibly profound

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:15.000
about sitting down with my closest friends

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:17.000
and telling them what they meant to me.

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:19.000
And one of the things that I learned is that over time,

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:22.000
particularly men, who used to be non-communicative,

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.000
are becoming more and more communicative.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.000
And that particularly happened -- there was one in my life --

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:28.000
is this Council of Dads

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.000
that Linda said, what we were talking about,

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:33.000
it's like what the moms talk about at school drop-off.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:35.000
And no one captures this modern manhood to me

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:37.000
more than David Black.

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:39.000
Now David is my literary agent.

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:41.000
He's about five-foot three and a half on a good day,

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:43.000
standing fully upright in cowboy boots.

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:46.000
And on kind of the manly-male front, he answers the phone --

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.000
I can say this I guess because you've done it here --

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:51.000
he answers the phone, "Yo, motherfucker."

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:54.000
He gives boring speeches about obscure bottles of wine,

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:57.000
and on his 50th birthday he bought a convertible sports car --

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:00.000
although, like a lot of men, he's impatient; he bought it on his 49th.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:03.000
But like a lot of modern men, he hugs, he bakes,

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:05.000
he leaves work early to coach Little League.

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:08.000
Someone asked me if he cried when I asked him to be in the council of dads.

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:10.000
I was like, "David cries when you invite him to take a walk."

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:12.000
(Laughter)

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:14.000
But he's a literary agent,

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:17.000
which means he's a broker of dreams in a world where most dreams don't come true.

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:19.000
And this is what we wanted him to capture --

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:22.000
what it means to have setbacks and then aspirations.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:25.000
And I said, "What's the most valuable thing you can give to a dreamer?"

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:28.000
And he said, "A belief in themselves."

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.000
"But when I came to see you," I said, "I didn't believe in myself.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.000
I was at a wall."

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.000
He said, "I don't see the wall," and I'm telling you the same,

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:36.000
Don't see the wall.

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:38.000
You may encounter one from time to time,

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:40.000
but you've got to find a way to get over it, around it, or through it.

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:43.000
But whatever you do, don't succumb to it.

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:45.000
Don't give in to the wall.

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:50.000
My home is not far from the Brooklyn Bridge,

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:52.000
and during the year and a half I was on crutches,

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:54.000
it became a sort of symbol to me.

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:56.000
So one day near the end of my journey,

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:59.000
I said, "Come on girls, let's take a walk across the Brooklyn Bridge."

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:01.000
We set out on crutches.

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.000
I was on crutches, my wife was next to me,

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:06.000
my girls were doing these rockstar poses up ahead.

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:09.000
And because walking was one of the first things I lost,

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:11.000
I spent most of that year

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:13.000
thinking about this most elemental of human acts.

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:15.000
Walking upright, we are told,

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:18.000
is the threshold of what made us human.

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:21.000
And yet, for the four million years humans have been walking upright,

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:23.000
the act is essentially unchanged.

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:25.000
As my physical therapist likes to say,

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:28.000
"Every step is a tragedy waiting to happen."

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:30.000
You nearly fall with one leg,

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:33.000
then you catch yourself with the other.

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:35.000
And the biggest consequence of walking on crutches --

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:37.000
as I did for a year and a half --

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:39.000
is that you walk slower.

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:41.000
You hurry,

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:44.000
you get where you're going, but you get there alone.

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:46.000
You go slow, you get where you're going,

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:48.000
but you get there with this community

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:50.000
you built along the way.

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:52.000
At the risk of admission, I was never nicer

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:54.000
than the year I was on crutches.

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:56.000
200 years ago,

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:59.000
a new type of pedestrian appeared in Paris.

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:02.000
He was called a "flaneur," one who wanders the arcades.

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:05.000
And it was the custom of those flaneurs

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:07.000
to show they were men of leisure

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:09.000
by taking turtles for walks

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:12.000
and letting the reptile set the pace.

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:14.000
And I just love this ode to slow moving.

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:17.000
And it's become my own motto for my girls.

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:19.000
Take a walk with a turtle.

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:22.000
Behold the world in pause.

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:24.000
And this idea of pausing

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:27.000
may be the single biggest lesson I took from my journey.

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:29.000
There's a quote from Moses

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:31.000
on the side of the Liberty Bell,

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:34.000
and it comes from a passage in the book of Leviticus,

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:37.000
that every seven years you should let the land lay fallow.

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:39.000
And every seven sets of seven years,

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:42.000
the land gets an extra year of rest

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:44.000
during which time all families are reunited

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:47.000
and people surrounded with the ones they love.

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:50.000
That 50th year is called the jubilee year,

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:52.000
and it's the origin of that term.

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:54.000
And though I'm shy of 50,

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:56.000
it captures my own experience.

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:59.000
My lost year was my jubilee year.

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:01.000
By laying fallow,

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:03.000
I planted the seeds for a healthier future

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:06.000
and was reunited with the ones I love.

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:08.000
Come the one year anniversary of my journey,

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:10.000
I went to see my surgeon, Dr. John Healey --

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:13.000
and by the way, Healey, great name for a doctor.

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:17.000
He's the president of the International Society of Limb Salvage,

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:20.000
which is the least euphemistic term I've ever heard.

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:23.000
And I said, "Dr. Healey, if my daughters come to you one day

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:25.000
and say, 'What should I learn from my daddy's story?'

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:27.000
what would you tell them?"

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:29.000
He said, "I would tell them what I know,

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:33.000
and that is everybody dies,

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:36.000
but not everybody lives.

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:38.000
I want you to live."

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:40.000
I wrote a letter to my girls

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:42.000
that appears at the end of my book, "The Council of Dads,"

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:44.000
and I listed these lessons,

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:46.000
a few of which you've heard here today:

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:48.000
Approach the cow, pack your flipflops,

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:50.000
don't see the wall,

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:52.000
live the questions,

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:54.000
harvest miracles.

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:57.000
As I looked at this list -- to me it was sort of like a psalm book of living --

00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:00.000
I realized, we may have done it for our girls,

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:02.000
but it really changed us.

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:04.000
And that is, the secret of the Council of Dads,

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:06.000
is that my wife and I did this

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:09.000
in an attempt to help our daughters,

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:11.000
but it really changed us.

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:13.000
So I stand here today

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:17.000
as you see now, walking without crutches or a cane.

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:19.000
And last week I had my 18-month scans.

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:21.000
And as you all know,

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:23.000
anybody with cancer has to get follow-up scans.

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:25.000
In my case it's quarterly.

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:27.000
And all the collective minds in this room, I dare say,

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:30.000
can never find a solution for scan-xiety.

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:32.000
As I was going there, I was wondering, what would I say

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:34.000
depending on what happened here.

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:38.000
I got good news that day,

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:40.000
and I stand here today cancer-free,

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:42.000
walking without aid

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:45.000
and hobbling forward.

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:48.000
And I just want to mention briefly in passing -- I'm past my time limit --

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:50.000
but I just want to briefly mention in passing

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:52.000
that one of the nice things that can come out of a conference like this

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:54.000
is, at a similar meeting,

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:56.000
back in the spring,

00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:58.000
Anne Wojcicki heard about our story

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:00.000
and very quickly -- in a span of three weeks --

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:02.000
put the full resources of 23andMe,

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:05.000
and we announced an initiative in July

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:07.000
to get to decode the genome

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:10.000
of anybody, a living person

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:13.000
with a heart tissue, bone sarcoma.

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:16.000
And she told me last night, in the three months since we've done it,

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:19.000
we've gotten 300 people who've contributed to this program.

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:21.000
And the epidemiologists here will tell you,

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:23.000
that's half the number of people who get the disease

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:25.000
in one year in the United States.

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:27.000
So if you go to 23andMe,

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:30.000
or if you go to councilofdads.com, you can click on a link.

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:33.000
And we encourage anybody to join this effort.

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:36.000
But I'll just close what I've been talking about

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:38.000
by leaving you with this message:

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:40.000
May you find an excuse to reach out to some long-lost pal,

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:42.000
or to that college roommate,

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:44.000
or to some person you may have turned away from.

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:47.000
May you find a mud puddle to jump in someplace,

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:49.000
or find a way to get over, around, or through any wall

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:52.000
that stands between you and one of your dreams.

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:54.000
And every now and then,

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:56.000
find a friend, find a turtle,

00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:59.000
and take a long, slow walk.

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:02.000
Thank you very much.

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:12.000
(Applause)
