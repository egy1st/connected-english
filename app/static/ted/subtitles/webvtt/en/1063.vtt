00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Aloha. (Audience: Aloha.)

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Today I'm going to try to convince you

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
that what the world needs now

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
is ukulele.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
You know, this is the underdog of all instruments.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
And I've always believed

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
that it's the instrument of peace,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
because if everyone played the ukulele,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
this world would be a much happier place.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
So I'm going to play Queen's "Bohemian Rhapsody."

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
(Laughter)

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
(Applause)

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:57.000
(Music)

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:46.000
(Applause)
