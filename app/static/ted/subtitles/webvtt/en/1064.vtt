00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.000
I am passionate about the American landscape

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
and how the physical form of the land,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
from the great Central Valley of California

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
to the bedrock of Manhattan,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
has really shaped our history and our character.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
But one thing is clear.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
In the last 100 years alone,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
our country -- and this is a sprawl map of America --

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
our country has systematically

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
flattened and homogenized the landscape

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
to the point where we've forgotten

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
our relationship with the plants and animals

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
that live alongside us

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
and the dirt beneath our feet.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
And so, how I see my work contributing

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
is sort of trying to literally re-imagine these connections

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
and physically rebuild them.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
This graph represents what we're dealing with now

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
in the built environment.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
And it's really a conflux

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
of urban population rising,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
biodiversity plummeting

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
and also, of course, sea levels rising

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
and climate changing.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
So when I also think about design,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
I think about

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
trying to rework and re-engage

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
the lines on this graph

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
in a more productive way.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
And you can see from the arrow here

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
indicating "you are here,"

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
I'm trying to sort of blend and meld

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
these two very divergent fields

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
of urbanism and ecology,

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
and sort of bring them together in an exciting new way.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000
So the era of big infrastructure is over.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
I mean, these sort of top-down,

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
mono-functional, capital-intensive solutions

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
are really not going to cut it.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
We need new tools and new approaches.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
Similarly, the idea of architecture

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
as this sort of object in the field,

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
devoid of context,

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
is really not the --

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
excuse me, it's fairly blatant --

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
is really not the approach

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
that we need to take.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
So we need new stories,

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
new heroes and new tools.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
So now I want to introduce you to my new hero

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
in the global climate change war,

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
and that is the eastern oyster.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
So, albeit a very small creature

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
and very modest,

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
this creature is incredible,

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
because it can agglomerate

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
into these mega-reef structures.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
It can grow; you can grow it;

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000
and -- did I mention? -- it's quite tasty.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
So the oyster was the basis

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
for a manifesto-like urban design project

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
that I did about the New York Harbor

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
called "oyster-tecture."

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000
And the core idea of oyster-tecture is to harness the biological power

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000
of mussels, eelgrass and oysters --

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
species that live in the harbor --

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
and, at the same time,

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
harness the power of people

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
who live in the community

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
towards making change now.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
Here's a map of my city, New York City,

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
showing inundation in red.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
And what's circled is the site that I'm going to talk about,

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000
the Gowanus Canal and Governors Island.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
If you look here at this map,

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
showing everything in blue

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
is out in the water,

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
and everything in yellow is upland.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
But you can see, even just intuit, from this map,

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000
that the harbor has dredged and flattened,

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
and went from a rich, three-dimensional mosaic to flat muck

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000
in really a matter of years.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000
Another set of views of actually the Gowanus Canal itself.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000
Now the Gowanus is particularly smelly -- I will admit it.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000
There are problems of sewage overflow

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000
and contamination,

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.000
but I would also argue that almost every city

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
has this exact condition,

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000
and it's a condition that we're all facing.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
And here's a map of that condition,

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.000
showing the contaminants in yellow and green,

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000
exacerbated by this new flow of

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000
storm-surge and sea-level rise.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000
So we really had a lot to deal with.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000
When we started this project,

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000
one of the core ideas was to look back in history

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000
and try to understand what was there.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000
And you can see from this map,

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000
there's this incredible geographical signature

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000
of a series of islands

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000
that were out in the harbor

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.000
and a matrix of salt marshes and beaches

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000
that served as natural wave attenuation

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
for the upland settlement.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000
We also learned at this time

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.000
that you could eat an oyster about the size of a dinner plate

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.000
in the Gowanus Canal itself.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.000
So our concept is really this back-to-the-future concept,

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.000
harnessing the intelligence of that land settlement pattern.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000
And the idea has two core stages.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.000
One is to develop a new artificial ecology,

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000
a reef out in the harbor,

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.000
that would then protect new settlement patterns

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000
inland and the Gowanus.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000
Because if you have cleaner water and slower water,

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.000
you can imagine a new way of living with that water.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.000
So the project really addresses these three core issues

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.000
in a new and exciting way, I think.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.000
Here we are, back to our hero, the oyster.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.000
And again, it's this incredibly exciting animal.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000
It accepts algae and detritus in one end,

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000
and through this beautiful, glamorous

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000
set of stomach organs,

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.000
out the other end comes cleaner water.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.000
And one oyster can filter up to 50 gallons of water a day.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000
Oyster reefs also covered

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000
about a quarter of our harbor

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000
and were capable of filtering water in the harbor in a matter of days.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:07.000
They were key in our culture and our economy.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000
Basically, New York was built

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000
on the backs of oystermen,

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.000
and our streets were literally built over oyster shells.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000
This image

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000
is an image of an oyster cart,

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.000
which is now as ubiquitous as the hotdog cart is today.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000
So again, we got the short end of the deal there.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000
(Laughter)

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000
Finally, oysters can attenuate

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000
and agglomerate onto each other

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.000
and form these amazing natural reef structures.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.000
They really become nature's wave attenuators.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000
And they become the bedrock

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000
of any harbor ecosystem.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000
Many, many species depend on them.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000
So we were inspired by the oyster,

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.000
but I was also inspired by the life cycle of the oyster.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.000
It can move from a fertilized egg

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.000
to a spat, which is when they're floating through the water,

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.000
and when they're ready to attach onto another oyster,

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000
to an adult male oyster or female oyster,

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.000
in a number of weeks.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000
We reinterpreted this life cycle

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.000
on the scale of our sight

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.000
and took the Gowanus

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000
as a giant oyster nursery

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000
where oysters would be grown up in the Gowanus,

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000
then paraded down in their spat stage

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.000
and seeded out on the Bayridge Reef.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000
And so the core idea here

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.000
was to hit the reset button

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.000
and regenerate an ecology over time

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.000
that was regenerative and cleaning

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.000
and productive.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:28.000
How does the reef work? Well, it's very, very simple.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000
A core concept here

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000
is that climate change

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000
isn't something that --

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.000
the answers won't land down from the Moon.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000
And with a $20 billion price tag,

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.000
we should simply start and get to work with what we have now

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.000
and what's in front of us.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.000
So this image is simply showing --

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000
it's a field of marine piles

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.000
interconnected with this woven fuzzy rope.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.000
What is fuzzy rope, you ask?

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.000
It's just that; it's this very inexpensive thing,

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.000
available practically at your hardware store, and it's very cheap.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000
So we imagine that we would actually

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.000
potentially even host a bake sale

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.000
to start our new project.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.000
(Laughter)

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000
So in the studio, rather than drawing,

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000
we began to learn how to knit.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.000
The concept was to really knit this rope together

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.000
and develop this new soft infrastructure

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.000
for the oysters to grow on.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.000
You can see in the diagram how it grows over time

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.000
from an infrastructural space

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:26.000
into a new public urban space.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.000
And that grows over time dynamically

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000
with the threat of climate change.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:34.000
It also creates this incredibly interesting, I think,

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:37.000
new amphibious public space,

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.000
where you can imagine working,

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.000
you can imagine recreating in a new way.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.000
In the end, what we realized we were making

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:47.000
was a new blue-green watery park

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.000
for the next watery century --

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.000
an amphibious park, if you will.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.000
So get your Tevas on.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.000
So you can imagine scuba diving here.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.000
This is an image of high school students,

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.000
scuba divers that we worked with on our team.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:02.000
So you can imagine a sort of new manner of living

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000
with a new relationship with the water,

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:07.000
and also a hybridizing of recreational and science programs

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.000
in terms of monitoring.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:12.000
Another new vocabulary word for the brave new world:

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.000
this is the word "flupsy" --

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:17.000
it's short for "floating upwelling system."

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:20.000
And this glorious, readily available device

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.000
is basically a floating raft

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.000
with an oyster nursery below.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.000
So the water is churned through this raft.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.000
You can see the eight chambers on the side

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:32.000
host little baby oysters and essentially force-feed them.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:35.000
So rather than having 10 oysters,

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.000
you have 10,000 oysters.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.000
And then those spat are then seeded.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.000
Here's the Gowanus future

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.000
with the oyster rafts on the shorelines --

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:46.000
the flupsification of the Gowanus.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.000
New word.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.000
And also showing oyster gardening for the community

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.000
along its edges.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.000
And finally, how much fun it would be

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.000
to watch the flupsy parade

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.000
and cheer on the oyster spats

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.000
as they go down to the reef.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:04.000
I get asked two questions about this project.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.000
One is: why isn't it happening now?

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:09.000
And the second one is: when can we eat the oysters?

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.000
And the answer is: not yet, they're working.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.000
But we imagine, with our calculations,

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.000
that by 2050,

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:19.000
you might be able to sink your teeth into a Gowanus oyster.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.000
To conclude, this is just one cross-section

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.000
of one piece of city,

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.000
but my dream is, my hope is,

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.000
that when you all go back to your own cities

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:30.000
that we can start to work together and collaborate

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.000
on remaking and reforming

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.000
a new urban landscape

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:37.000
towards a more sustainable, a more livable

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.000
and a more delicious future.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.000
Thank you.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:46.000
(Applause)
