00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
I'm going to have a pretty simple idea

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
that I'm just going to tell you over and over until I get you to believe it,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
and that is all of us are makers.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
I really believe that.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
All of us are makers.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
We're born makers.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
We have this ability

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
to make things,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
to grasp things with our hands.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
We use words like "grasp" metaphorically

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
to also think about understanding things.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
We don't just live, but we make.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
We create things.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Well I'm going to show you a group of makers

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
from Maker Faire and various places.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
It doesn't come out particularly well,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
but that's a particularly tall bicycle.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
It's a scraper bike; it's called --

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
from Oakland.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
And this is a particularly small scooter

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
for a gentleman of this size.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
But he's trying to power it, or motorize it,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
with a drill.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
(Laughter)

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
And the question he had is,

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
"Can I do it? Can it be done?"

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
Apparently it can.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
So makers are enthusiasts; they're amateurs;

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
they're people who love

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
doing what they do.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
They don't always even know why they're doing it.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
We have begun organizing makers

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
at our Maker Faire.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
There was one held in Detroit here last summer,

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
and it will be held again next summer, at the Henry Ford.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
But we hold them in San Francisco --

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
(Applause)

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
-- and in New York.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
And it's a fabulous event

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
to just meet and talk to these people who make things

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
and are there to just show them to you and talk about them

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
and have a great conversation.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
(Video) Guy: I might get one of those.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
Dale Dougherty: These are electric muffins.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
Guy: Where did you guys get those?

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
Muffin: Will you glide with us? (Guy: No.)

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
DD: I know Ford has new electric vehicles coming out.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
We got there first.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
Lady: Will you glide with us?

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
DD: This is something I call "swinging in the rain."

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
And you can barely see it,

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
but it's -- a controller at top cycles the water to fall

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
just before and after you pass through the bottom of the arc.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
So imagine a kid: "Am I going to get wet? Am I going to get wet?

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
No, I didn't get wet. Am I going to get wet? Am I going to get wet?"

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
That's the experience of a clever ride.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
And of course, we have fashion.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
People are remaking things into fashion.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
I don't know if this is called a basket-bra,

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
but it ought to be something like that.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
We have art students getting together,

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
taking old radiator parts

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
and doing an iron-pour to make something new out of it.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
They did that in the summer, and it was very warm.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
Now this one takes a little bit of explaining.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
You know what those are, right?

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
Billy-Bob, or Billy Bass, or something like that.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000
Now the background is -- the guy who did this is a physicist.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
And here he'll explain a little bit about what it does.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
(Video) Richard Carter: I'm Richard Carter,

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000
and this is the Sashimi Tabernacle Choir.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
Choir: ♫ When you hold me in your arms ♫

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
DD: This is all computer-controlled

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000
in an old Volvo.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:02.000
Choir: ♫ I'm hooked on a feelin' ♫

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:07.000
♫ I'm high on believin' ♫

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.000
♫ That you're in love with me ♫

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000
DD: So Richard came up from Houston last year

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000
to visit us in Detroit here

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000
and show the wonderful Sashimi Tabernacle Choir.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000
So, are you a maker?

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
How many people here would say you're a maker, if you raise your hand?

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
That's a pretty good --

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.000
but there's some of you out there that won't admit that you're makers.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
And again, think about it.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.000
You're makers of food; you're makers of shelter;

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000
you're makers of lots of different things,

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000
and partly what interests me today

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000
is you're makers of your own world,

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.000
and particularly the role that technology has

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000
in your life.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000
You're really a driver or a passenger --

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000
to use a Volkswagen phrase.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000
Makers are in control.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.000
That's what fascinates them. That's why they do what they do.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000
They want to figure out how things work;

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
they want to get access to it;

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
and they want to control it.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000
They want to use it to their own purpose.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000
Makers today, to some degree, are out on the edge.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000
They're not mainstream.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000
They're a little bit radical.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000
They're a bit subversive in what they do.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000
But at one time,

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.000
it was fairly commonplace to think of yourself as a maker.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.000
It was not something you'd even remark upon.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.000
And I found this old video.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.000
And I'll tell you more about it, but just ...

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:30.000
(Music)

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000
(Video) Narrator: Of all things Americans are,

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000
we are makers.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:58.000
With our strengths and our minds and spirit,

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.000
we gather, we form, and we fashion.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000
Makers and shapers

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000
and put-it-togetherers.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000
DD: So it goes on to show you

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000
people making things out of wood,

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.000
a grandfather making a ship in a bottle,

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000
a woman making a pie --

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.000
somewhat standard fare of the day.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.000
But it was a sense of pride

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000
that we made things,

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.000
that the world around us was made by us.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000
It didn't just exist.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000
We made it, and we were connected to it that way.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000
And I think that's tremendously important.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.000
Now I'm going to tell you one funny thing about this.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000
This particular reel --

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000
it's an industrial video --

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.000
but it was shown in drive-in theaters

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.000
in 1961 --

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.000
in the Detroit area, in fact --

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.000
and it preceded Alfred Hitchcock's "Psycho."

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000
(Laughter)

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000
So I like to think there was something going on there

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.000
of the new generation of makers

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.000
coming out of this, plus "Psycho."

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000
This is Andrew Archer.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000
I met Andrew at one of our community meetings

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.000
putting together Maker Faire.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.000
Andrew had moved to Detroit

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000
from Duluth, Minnesota.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000
And I talked to his mom,

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000
and I ended up doing a story on him

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000
for a magazine called Kidrobot.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.000
He's just a kid that grew up

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.000
playing with tools instead of toys.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000
He liked to take things apart.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000
His mother gave him a part of the garage,

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.000
and he collected things from yard sales, and he made stuff.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.000
And then he didn't particularly like school that much,

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000
but he got involved in robotics competitions,

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000
and he realized he had a talent,

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.000
and, more importantly, he had a real passion for it.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000
And he began building robots.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.000
And when I sat down next to him,

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.000
he was telling me about a company he formed,

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:46.000
and he was building some robots for automobile factories

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:49.000
to move things around on the factory floor.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000
And that's why he moved to Michigan.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000
But he also moved here

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.000
to meet other people doing what he's doing.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.000
And this kind of gets to this important idea today.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000
This is Jeff and Bilal and several others here

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.000
in a hackerspace.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.000
And there's about three hackerspaces or more in Detroit.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.000
And there's probably even some new ones since I've been here last.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000
But these are like clubs --

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.000
they're sharing tools, sharing space,

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:16.000
sharing expertise in what to make.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:19.000
And so it's a very interesting phenomenon

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.000
that's going across the world.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.000
But essentially these are people that are playing with technology.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.000
Let me say that again: playing.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.000
They don't necessarily know what they're doing or why they're doing it.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000
They're playing

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:34.000
to discover what the technology can do,

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:37.000
and probably to discover what they can do themselves,

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.000
what their own capabilities are.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.000
Now the other thing that I think is taking off,

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.000
another reason making is taking off today,

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:47.000
is there's some great new tools out there.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.000
And you can't see this very well on the screen,

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:52.000
but Arduino -- Arduino is an open-source hardware platform.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000
It's a micro-controller.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.000
If you don't know what those are, they're just the "brains."

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:59.000
So they're the brains of maker projects,

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:02.000
and here's an example of one.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000
And I don't know if you can see it that well, but that's a mailbox --

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.000
so an ordinary mailbox and an Arduino.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.000
So you figure out how to program this,

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.000
and you put this in your mailbox.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:13.000
And when someone opens your mailbox,

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.000
you get a notification,

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.000
an alert message goes to your iPhone.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.000
Now that could be a dog door,

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:24.000
it could be someone going somewhere where they shouldn't,

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000
like a little brother into a little sister's room.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:29.000
There's all kinds of different things

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000
that you can imagine for that.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.000
Now here's something -- a 3D printer.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.000
That's another tool that's really taken off -- really, really interesting.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.000
This is Makerbot.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.000
And there are industrial versions of this --

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000
about 20,000 dollars.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.000
These guys came up with a kit version

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000
for 750 dollars,

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:49.000
and that means that hobbyists and ordinary folks

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:52.000
can get a hold of this and begin playing with 3D printers.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.000
Now they don't know what they want to do with it,

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.000
but they're going to figure it out.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:59.000
They will only figure it out by getting their hands on it and playing with it.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:02.000
One of the coolest things is, Makerbot sent out an upgrade,

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000
some new brackets for the box.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:07.000
Well you printed out the brackets

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:10.000
and then replaced the old brackets with the new ones.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.000
Isn't that cool?

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.000
So makers harvest technology

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.000
from all the places around us.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.000
This is a radar speed detector

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:22.000
that was developed from a Hot Wheels toy.

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.000
And they do interesting things.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:27.000
They're really creating new areas and exploring areas

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.000
that you might only think --

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.000
the military is doing drones --

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.000
well, there is a whole community of people

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:36.000
building autonomous airplanes, or vehicles --

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.000
something that you could program to fly on its own,

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:41.000
without a stick or anything, to figure out what path it's going.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.000
Fascinating work they're doing.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:46.000
We just had an issue on space exploration,

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.000
DIY space exploration.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:51.000
This is probably the best time in the history of mankind

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.000
to love space.

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:56.000
You could build your own satellite and get it into space

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.000
for like 8,000 dollars.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:01.000
Think how much money and how many years it took NASA

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:04.000
to get satellites into space.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.000
In fact, these guys actually work for NASA,

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:09.000
and they're trying to pioneer using off-the-shelf components,

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.000
cheap things that aren't specialized

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.000
that they can combine

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.000
and send up into space.

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:17.000
Makers are a source of innovation,

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.000
and I think it relates back to something

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.000
like the birth of the personal computer industry.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:24.000
This is Steve Wozniak. Where does he learn about computers?

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:27.000
It's the Homebrew Computer Club -- just like a hackerspace.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:30.000
And he says, "I could go there all day long

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.000
and talk to people

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.000
and share ideas for free."

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.000
Well he did a little bit better than free.

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.000
But it's important to understand

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:41.000
that a lot of the origins of our industries --

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.000
even like Henry Ford --

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.000
come from this idea of playing

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.000
and figuring things out in groups.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.000
Well, if I haven't convinced you that you're a maker,

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.000
I hope I could convince you

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:54.000
that our next generation should be makers,

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:57.000
that kids are particularly interested in this,

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.000
in this ability to control the physical world

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:02.000
and be able to use things like micro-controllers

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:04.000
and build robots.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:06.000
And we've got to get this into schools,

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:09.000
or into communities in many, many ways --

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.000
the ability to tinker,

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:14.000
to shape and reshape the world around us.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.000
There's a great opportunity today --

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.000
and that's what I really care about the most.

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.000
An the answer to the question: what will America make?

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.000
It's more makers.

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.000
Thank you very much.

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.000
(Applause)
