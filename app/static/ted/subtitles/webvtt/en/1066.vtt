00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
I'm going to make an argument today

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
that may seem a little bit crazy:

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
social media and the end of gender.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Let me connect the dots.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
I'm going to argue today

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
that the social media applications

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
that we all know and love, or love to hate,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
are actually going to help free us

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
from some of the absurd assumptions

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
that we have as a society about gender.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
I think that social media

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
is actually going to help us dismantle

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
some of the silly and demeaning stereotypes

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
that we see in media and advertising

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
about gender.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
If you hadn't noticed,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
our media climate generally provides

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
a very distorted mirror

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
of our lives and of our gender,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
and I think that's going to change.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Now most media companies --

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
television, radio, publishing, games, you name it --

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
they use very rigid segmentation methods

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
in order to understand their audiences.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
It's old-school demographics.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000
They come up with these very restrictive labels to define us.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
Now the crazy thing

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
is that media companies believe

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
that if you fall within a certain demographic category

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
then you are predictable in certain ways --

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
you have certain taste,

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
that you like certain things.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
And so the bizarre result of this

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
is that most of our popular culture

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
is actually based on these presumptions

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
about our demographics.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
Age demographics:

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
the 18 to 49 demo

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
has had a huge impact

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
on all mass media programming in this country

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
since the 1960s,

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
when the baby boomers were still young.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
Now they've aged out of that demographic,

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
but it's still the case

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
that powerful ratings companies like Nielson

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
don't even take into account

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
viewers of television shows over age 54.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
In our media environment,

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
it's as if they don't even exist.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
Now, if you watch "Mad Men," like I do --

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
it's a popular TV show in the States --

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
Dr. Faye Miller does something called psychographics,

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
which first came about in the 1960s,

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
where you create these complex psychological profiles

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
of consumers.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
But psychographics really haven't had a huge impact on the media business.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000
It's really just been basic demographics.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000
So I'm at the Norman Lear Center at USC,

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000
and we've done a lot of research over the last seven, eight years

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
on demographics

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
and how they affect media and entertainment

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
in this country and abroad.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
And in the last three years,

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000
we've been looking specifically at social media to see what has changed,

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000
and we've discovered some very interesting things.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000
All the people who participate in social media networks

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000
belong to the same old demographic categories

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
that media companies and advertisers

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
have used in order to understand them.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000
But those categories mean even less now

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000
than they did before,

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
because with online networking tools,

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
it's much easier for us

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
to escape some of our demographic boxes.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000
We're able to connect with people quite freely

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000
and to redefine ourselves online.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000
And we can lie about our age online, too, pretty easily.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000
We can also connect with people

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000
based on our very specific interests.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
We don't need a media company

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
to help do this for us.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000
So the traditional media companies, of course,

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000
are paying very close attention to these online communities.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.000
They know this is the mass audience of the future;

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
they need to figure it out.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000
But they're having a hard time doing it

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.000
because they're still trying to use demographics in order to understand them,

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000
because that's how ad rates are still determined.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000
When they're monitoring your clickstream --

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000
and you know they are --

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000
they have a really hard time

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000
figuring out your age, your gender and your income.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000
They can make some educated guesses.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000
But they get a lot more information

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000
about what you do online,

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000
what you like, what interests you.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000
That's easier for them to find out than who you are.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
And even though that's still sort of creepy,

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
there is an upside

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.000
to having your taste monitored.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000
Suddenly our taste is being respected

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000
in a way that it hasn't been before.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000
It had been presumed before.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000
So when you look online at the way people aggregate,

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000
they don't aggregate

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000
around age, gender and income.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000
They aggregate around the things they love,

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000
the things that they like,

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000
and if you think about it, shared interests and values

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.000
are a far more powerful aggregator of human beings

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000
than demographic categories.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000
I'd much rather know

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.000
whether you like "Buffy the Vampire Slayer"

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000
rather than how old you are.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.000
That would tell me something more substantial about you.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000
Now there's something else that we've discovered about social media

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000
that's actually quite surprising.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000
It turns out that women

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.000
are really driving the social media revolution.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000
If you look at the statistics --

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
these are worldwide statistics --

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.000
in every single age category,

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000
women actually outnumber men

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000
in their use of social networking technologies.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000
And then if you look at the amount of time

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000
that they spend on these sites,

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.000
they truly dominate the social media space,

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.000
which is a space that's having a huge impact

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000
on old media.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000
The question is: what sort of impact

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000
is this going to have on our culture,

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000
and what's it going to mean for women?

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000
If the case is that social media

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000
is dominating old media

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.000
and women are dominating social media,

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000
then does that mean that women

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000
are going to take over global media?

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.000
Are we suddenly going to see

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.000
a lot more female characters in cartoons

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.000
and in games and on TV shows?

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:42.000
Will the next big-budget blockbuster movies

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.000
actually be chick flicks?

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000
Could this be possible,

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.000
that suddenly our media landscape

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.000
will become a feminist landscape?

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.000
Well, I actually don't think that's going to be the case.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.000
I think that media companies are going to hire a lot more women,

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000
because they realize this is important for their business,

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.000
and I think that women

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000
are also going to continue to dominate

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000
the social media sphere.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.000
But I think women are actually going to be -- ironically enough --

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.000
responsible for driving a stake through the heart

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:17.000
of cheesy genre categories

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.000
like the "chick flick"

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.000
and all these other genre categories

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.000
that presume that certain demographic groups

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000
like certain things --

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000
that Hispanics like certain things,

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000
that young people like certain things.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000
This is far too simplistic.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.000
The future entertainment media that we're going to see

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.000
is going to be very data-driven,

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000
and it's going to be based on the information

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.000
that we ascertain from taste communities online,

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.000
where women are really driving the action.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.000
So you may be asking, well why is it important

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.000
that I know what entertains people?

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.000
Why should I know this?

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000
Of course, old media companies and advertisers

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000
need to know this.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.000
But my argument is that,

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000
if you want to understand the global village,

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000
it's probably a good idea that you figure out

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.000
what they're passionate about, what amuses them,

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:08.000
what they choose to do in their free time.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:11.000
This is a very important thing to know about people.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.000
I've spent most of my professional life

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.000
researching media and entertainment

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.000
and its impact on people's lives.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.000
And I do it not just because it's fun --

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.000
though actually, it is really fun --

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.000
but also because

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.000
our research has shown over and over again

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000
that entertainment and play

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:32.000
have a huge impact on people's lives --

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.000
for instance, on their political beliefs

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000
and on their health.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.000
And so, if you have any interest in understanding the world,

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.000
looking at how people amuse themselves

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:44.000
is a really good way to start.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:47.000
So imagine a media atmosphere

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:50.000
that isn't dominated by lame stereotypes

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000
about gender

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000
and other demographic characteristics.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.000
Can you even imagine what that looks like?

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.000
I can't wait to find out what it looks like.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000
Thank you so much.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:06.000
(Applause)
