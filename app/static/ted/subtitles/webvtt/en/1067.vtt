WEBVTT

00:00:00.222 --> 00:00:03.571
Running: it's basically just
right, left, right, left, yeah?

00:00:03.595 --> 00:00:06.024
I mean, we've been doing it
for two million years,

00:00:06.048 --> 00:00:09.594
so it's kind of arrogant to assume
that I've got something to say

00:00:09.618 --> 00:00:12.838
that hasn't been said and performed
better a long time ago.

00:00:13.234 --> 00:00:15.792
But the cool thing about running,
as I've discovered,

00:00:15.816 --> 00:00:19.401
is that something bizarre happens
in this activity all the time.

00:00:19.425 --> 00:00:23.000
Case in point: A couple months ago,
if you saw the New York City Marathon,

00:00:23.024 --> 00:00:26.612
I guarantee you, you saw something
that no one has ever seen before.

00:00:27.227 --> 00:00:31.064
An Ethiopian woman named Derartu Tulu
turns up at the starting line.

00:00:31.762 --> 00:00:33.114
She's 37 years old.

00:00:33.138 --> 00:00:35.824
She hasn't won a marathon
of any kind in eight years,

00:00:35.848 --> 00:00:37.276
and a few months previously,

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:39.276
she had almost died in childbirth.

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.791
Derartu Tulu was ready to hang it up
and retire from the sport,

00:00:42.815 --> 00:00:44.687
but she decided she'd go for broke

00:00:44.711 --> 00:00:48.499
and try for one last big payday
in the marquee event,

00:00:48.523 --> 00:00:50.138
the New York City Marathon.

00:00:50.162 --> 00:00:53.876
Except -- bad news for Derartu Tulu --
some other people had the same idea,

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:55.754
including the Olympic gold medalist,

00:00:55.778 --> 00:00:58.876
and Paula Radcliffe, who is a monster,

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:02.472
the fastest woman marathoner
in history by far.

00:01:02.496 --> 00:01:04.773
Only 10 minutes
off the men's world record,

00:01:04.797 --> 00:01:07.701
Paula Radcliffe is essentially unbeatable.

00:01:08.343 --> 00:01:09.876
That's her competition.

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.848
The gun goes off, and -- I mean,
she's not even an underdog;

00:01:12.872 --> 00:01:14.687
she's, like, under the underdogs.

00:01:14.711 --> 00:01:16.756
But the under-underdog hangs tough,

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:19.591
and 22 miles into a 26-mile race,

00:01:19.615 --> 00:01:22.511
there is Derartu Tulu,
up there with the lead pack.

00:01:23.304 --> 00:01:25.995
Now, this is when something
really bizarre happens.

00:01:26.019 --> 00:01:29.781
Paula Radcliffe, the one person
who is sure to snatch the big paycheck

00:01:29.805 --> 00:01:32.876
from Derartu Tulu's under-underdog hands,

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:35.297
suddenly grabs her leg
and starts to fall back.

00:01:35.321 --> 00:01:37.732
So we all know what to do
in this situation, right?

00:01:37.756 --> 00:01:40.442
You give her a quick crack
in the teeth with your elbow

00:01:40.466 --> 00:01:41.965
and blaze for the finish line.

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:44.479
Derartu Tulu ruins the script.

00:01:44.503 --> 00:01:45.952
Instead of taking off,

00:01:45.976 --> 00:01:48.225
she falls back and she grabs
Paula Radcliffe,

00:01:48.249 --> 00:01:50.587
and says, "Come on.
Come with us. You can do it."

00:01:50.611 --> 00:01:53.022
So Paula Radcliffe,
unfortunately, does it.

00:01:53.046 --> 00:01:54.659
She catches up with the lead pack

00:01:54.683 --> 00:01:56.546
and is pushing toward the finish line.

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:58.089
But then she falls back again.

00:01:58.113 --> 00:02:01.105
The second time, Derartu Tulu
grabs her and tries to pull her.

00:02:01.129 --> 00:02:03.967
And Paula Radcliffe, at that point,
says, "I'm done. Go."

00:02:04.511 --> 00:02:07.267
So that's a fantastic story,
and we all know how it ends.

00:02:07.291 --> 00:02:08.581
She loses the check,

00:02:08.605 --> 00:02:11.530
but she goes home with something
bigger and more important.

00:02:11.554 --> 00:02:14.050
Except Derartu Tulu
ruins the script again.

00:02:14.074 --> 00:02:17.574
Instead of losing, she blazes
past the lead pack and wins.

00:02:17.598 --> 00:02:19.260
Wins the New York City Marathon,

00:02:19.284 --> 00:02:20.918
goes home with a big fat check.

00:02:21.677 --> 00:02:23.213
It's a heartwarming story,

00:02:23.237 --> 00:02:25.214
but if you drill a little bit deeper,

00:02:25.238 --> 00:02:28.646
you've got to sort of wonder
about what exactly was going on there.

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:30.805
When you have two outliers
in one organism,

00:02:30.829 --> 00:02:32.203
it's not a coincidence.

00:02:32.227 --> 00:02:35.718
When you have someone who is more
competitive and more compassionate

00:02:35.742 --> 00:02:38.719
than anybody else in the race,
again, it's not a coincidence.

00:02:38.743 --> 00:02:41.186
You show me a creature
with webbed feet and gills;

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:42.858
somehow water's involved.

00:02:42.882 --> 00:02:46.264
Someone with that kind of heart,
there's some kind of connection there.

00:02:46.288 --> 00:02:48.855
And the answer to it,
I think, can be found

00:02:48.879 --> 00:02:51.288
down in the Copper Canyons of Mexico,

00:02:51.312 --> 00:02:55.189
where there's a reclusive tribe,
called the Tarahumara Indians.

00:02:55.213 --> 00:02:58.772
Now, the Tarahumara
are remarkable for three things.

00:02:58.796 --> 00:03:00.271
Number one is:

00:03:00.295 --> 00:03:04.501
they have been living essentially
unchanged for the past 400 years.

00:03:04.525 --> 00:03:08.139
When the conquistadors arrived
in North America you had two choices:

00:03:08.163 --> 00:03:10.876
you either fight back and engage
or you could take off.

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:12.758
The Mayans and Aztecs engaged,

00:03:12.782 --> 00:03:15.228
which is why there are very few
Mayans and Aztecs.

00:03:15.252 --> 00:03:17.237
The Tarahumara had a different strategy.

00:03:17.261 --> 00:03:19.125
They took off and hid

00:03:19.149 --> 00:03:24.004
in this labyrinthine, networking,
spider-webbing system of canyons

00:03:24.028 --> 00:03:25.429
called the Copper Canyons.

00:03:25.453 --> 00:03:28.876
And there they've remained
since the 1600s,

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:31.503
essentially the same way
they've always been.

00:03:32.321 --> 00:03:35.478
The second thing remarkable
about the Tarahumara is:

00:03:35.502 --> 00:03:38.630
deep into old age -- 70 to 80 years old --

00:03:38.654 --> 00:03:40.631
these guys aren't running marathons;

00:03:40.655 --> 00:03:42.502
they're running mega-marathons.

00:03:42.526 --> 00:03:44.171
They're not doing 26 miles,

00:03:44.195 --> 00:03:46.817
they're doing 100, 150 miles at a time,

00:03:46.841 --> 00:03:49.310
and apparently without injury,
without problems.

00:03:49.956 --> 00:03:52.672
The last thing that's remarkable
about the Tarahumara is:

00:03:52.696 --> 00:03:55.213
all the things we're going
to be talking about today,

00:03:55.237 --> 00:03:58.042
all the things we're trying to use
all of our technology

00:03:58.066 --> 00:03:59.404
and brain power to solve --

00:03:59.428 --> 00:04:01.978
things like heart disease
and cholesterol and cancer;

00:04:02.002 --> 00:04:05.600
crime, warfare and violence;
clinical depression -- all this stuff --

00:04:05.624 --> 00:04:08.096
the Tarahumara don't know
what you're talking about.

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:11.876
They are free from all
of these modern ailments.

00:04:12.728 --> 00:04:13.957
So what's the connection?

00:04:13.981 --> 00:04:15.719
Again, we're talking about outliers;

00:04:15.743 --> 00:04:18.034
there's got to be some kind
of cause and effect.

00:04:18.058 --> 00:04:21.876
Well, there are teams of scientists
at Harvard and the University of Utah

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:24.480
that are bending their brains
and trying to figure out

00:04:24.504 --> 00:04:26.447
what the Tarahumara have known forever.

00:04:26.471 --> 00:04:29.135
They're trying to solve
those same kinds of mysteries.

00:04:29.159 --> 00:04:32.582
And once again, a mystery
wrapped inside of a mystery --

00:04:32.606 --> 00:04:35.725
perhaps the key to Derartu Tulu
and the Tarahumara

00:04:35.749 --> 00:04:38.386
is wrapped in three other
mysteries, which go like this:

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:41.819
Three things -- if you have the answer,
come up and take the microphone,

00:04:41.843 --> 00:04:43.672
because nobody else knows the answer.

00:04:43.696 --> 00:04:46.581
If you know it, you're smarter
than anybody on planet Earth.

00:04:46.605 --> 00:04:48.028
Mystery number one is this:

00:04:48.052 --> 00:04:50.806
Two million years ago,
the human brain exploded in size.

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:52.941
Australopithecus
had a tiny little pea brain.

00:04:52.965 --> 00:04:56.011
Suddenly humans show up,
Homo erectus, big old melon head.

00:04:56.035 --> 00:04:57.558
To have a brain of that size,

00:04:57.582 --> 00:05:01.185
you need to have a source
of condensed caloric energy.

00:05:01.209 --> 00:05:03.830
In other words, early humans
are eating dead animals --

00:05:03.854 --> 00:05:05.186
no argument, that's a fact.

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:07.117
The only problem is,

00:05:07.141 --> 00:05:10.731
the first edged weapons only appeared
about 200,000 years ago.

00:05:10.755 --> 00:05:13.450
So somehow, for nearly two million years,

00:05:13.474 --> 00:05:16.145
we are killing animals
without any weapons.

00:05:16.169 --> 00:05:17.869
Now, we're not using our strength,

00:05:17.893 --> 00:05:20.251
because we are the biggest
sissies in the jungle.

00:05:20.275 --> 00:05:22.317
Every other animal
is stronger than we are,

00:05:22.341 --> 00:05:25.771
they have fangs, they have claws,
they have nimbleness, they have speed.

00:05:25.795 --> 00:05:27.166
We think Usain Bolt is fast.

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:29.534
Usain Bolt can get
his ass kicked by a squirrel.

00:05:29.558 --> 00:05:30.709
We're not fast.

00:05:30.733 --> 00:05:32.224
That would be an Olympic event:

00:05:32.248 --> 00:05:35.085
turn a squirrel loose,
whoever catches it gets a gold medal.

00:05:35.109 --> 00:05:36.124
(Laughter)

00:05:36.148 --> 00:05:38.866
So no weapons, no speed,
no strength, no fangs, no claws.

00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:41.532
How were we killing these animals?
Mystery number one.

00:05:41.556 --> 00:05:42.997
Mystery number two:

00:05:43.021 --> 00:05:46.074
Women have been in the Olympics
for quite some time now,

00:05:46.098 --> 00:05:48.906
but one thing that's remarkable
about all women sprinters:

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:50.685
they all suck; they're terrible.

00:05:50.709 --> 00:05:54.437
There's not a fast woman on the planet
and there never has been.

00:05:54.461 --> 00:05:57.438
The fastest woman
to ever run a mile did it in 4:15.

00:05:57.462 --> 00:05:59.680
I could throw a rock
and hit a high-school boy

00:05:59.704 --> 00:06:01.200
who can run faster than 4:15.

00:06:01.224 --> 00:06:03.415
For some reason,
you guys are just really slow.

00:06:03.439 --> 00:06:04.597
But --

00:06:04.621 --> 00:06:05.680
(Laughter)

00:06:05.704 --> 00:06:08.450
But, you get to the marathon
we were just talking about --

00:06:08.474 --> 00:06:11.252
you've only been allowed to run
the marathon for 20 years,

00:06:11.276 --> 00:06:13.547
because prior to the 1980s,
medical science said

00:06:13.571 --> 00:06:16.935
if a woman tried to run 26 miles --
does anyone know what would happen

00:06:16.959 --> 00:06:18.392
if you tried to run 26 miles?

00:06:18.416 --> 00:06:21.032
Why you were banned
from the marathon before the 1980s?

00:06:21.056 --> 00:06:23.142
Audience Member: Her uterus would be torn.

00:06:23.166 --> 00:06:25.694
Christopher McDougall:
Her uterus would be torn, yes.

00:06:25.718 --> 00:06:26.958
Torn reproductive organs.

00:06:26.982 --> 00:06:29.241
The uterus would literally
fall out of the body.

00:06:29.265 --> 00:06:30.286
(Laughter)

00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:32.129
Now, I've been to a lot of marathons,

00:06:32.153 --> 00:06:33.794
and I've yet to see any ...

00:06:33.818 --> 00:06:36.727
(Laughter)

00:06:36.751 --> 00:06:38.118
So it's only been 20 years

00:06:38.142 --> 00:06:40.521
that women have been allowed
to run the marathon.

00:06:40.545 --> 00:06:44.566
In that very short learning curve,
you've gone from broken organs

00:06:44.590 --> 00:06:48.391
up to the fact that you're only 10 minutes
off the male world record.

00:06:48.415 --> 00:06:50.720
Then you go beyond 26 miles,
into the distance

00:06:50.744 --> 00:06:53.677
that medical science also told us
would be fatal to humans --

00:06:53.701 --> 00:06:56.067
remember Pheidippides died
when he ran 26 miles --

00:06:56.091 --> 00:06:59.359
you get to 50 and 100 miles,
and suddenly, it's a different game.

00:06:59.383 --> 00:07:02.626
You take a runner like Ann Trason
or Nikki Kimball or Jenn Shelton,

00:07:02.650 --> 00:07:06.077
put them in a race of 50 or 100 miles
against anybody in the world,

00:07:06.101 --> 00:07:08.078
and it's a coin toss who's going to win.

00:07:08.102 --> 00:07:09.448
I'll give you an example.

00:07:09.472 --> 00:07:11.987
A couple years ago,
Emily Baer signed up for a race

00:07:12.011 --> 00:07:13.701
called the Hardrock 100,

00:07:13.725 --> 00:07:16.287
which tells you all you need
to know about the race.

00:07:16.311 --> 00:07:18.350
They give you 48 hours
to finish this race.

00:07:18.374 --> 00:07:20.279
Well, Emily Baer -- 500 runners --

00:07:20.303 --> 00:07:22.650
she finishes in eighth place,
in the top 10,

00:07:22.674 --> 00:07:24.928
even though she stopped
at all the aid stations

00:07:24.952 --> 00:07:26.847
to breastfeed her baby during the race.

00:07:26.871 --> 00:07:27.885
(Laughter)

00:07:27.909 --> 00:07:29.607
And yet, she beat 492 other people.

00:07:30.131 --> 00:07:31.288
The last mystery:

00:07:31.312 --> 00:07:34.096
Why is it that women get stronger
as distances get longer?

00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:35.456
The third mystery is this:

00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:38.948
At the University of Utah,
they started tracking finishing times

00:07:38.972 --> 00:07:40.632
for people running the marathon.

00:07:40.656 --> 00:07:44.463
What they found is that if you start
running the marathon at age 19,

00:07:44.487 --> 00:07:46.740
you'll get progressively
faster, year by year,

00:07:46.764 --> 00:07:48.741
until you reach your peak at age 27.

00:07:48.765 --> 00:07:52.741
And then after that,
you succumb to the rigors of time.

00:07:52.765 --> 00:07:54.357
And you'll get slower and slower,

00:07:54.381 --> 00:07:57.970
until eventually you're back to running
the same speed you were at age 19.

00:07:57.994 --> 00:08:00.235
So about seven, eight years
to reach your peak,

00:08:00.259 --> 00:08:02.335
and then gradually you fall off your peak,

00:08:02.359 --> 00:08:04.637
until you go back to the starting point.

00:08:04.661 --> 00:08:07.881
You'd think it might take eight years
to go back to the same speed,

00:08:07.905 --> 00:08:10.637
maybe 10 years -- no, it's 45 years.

00:08:10.661 --> 00:08:12.638
64-year-old men and women

00:08:12.662 --> 00:08:15.701
are running as fast
as they were at age 19.

00:08:15.725 --> 00:08:18.713
Now, I defy you to come
up with any other physical activity --

00:08:18.737 --> 00:08:21.699
and please don't say golf --
something that's actually hard --

00:08:21.723 --> 00:08:22.771
(Laughter)

00:08:22.795 --> 00:08:27.342
where geriatrics are performing
as well as they did as teenagers.

00:08:27.366 --> 00:08:29.166
So you have these three mysteries.

00:08:29.661 --> 00:08:33.638
Is there one piece in the puzzle
which might wrap all these things up?

00:08:33.941 --> 00:08:37.029
You've got to be careful anytime
someone looks back in prehistory

00:08:37.053 --> 00:08:39.359
and tries to give you
a global answer because,

00:08:39.383 --> 00:08:42.170
it being prehistory, you can say
whatever the hell you want

00:08:42.194 --> 00:08:43.353
and get away with it.

00:08:43.377 --> 00:08:44.743
But I'll submit this to you:

00:08:44.767 --> 00:08:47.468
If you put one piece in the middle
of this jigsaw puzzle,

00:08:47.492 --> 00:08:49.870
suddenly it all starts
to form a coherent picture.

00:08:49.894 --> 00:08:52.282
If you're wondering
why the Tarahumara don't fight

00:08:52.306 --> 00:08:53.830
and don't die of heart disease,

00:08:53.854 --> 00:08:56.614
why a poor Ethiopian
woman named Derartu Tulu

00:08:56.638 --> 00:08:59.467
can be the most compassionate
and yet the most competitive,

00:08:59.491 --> 00:09:03.314
and why we somehow were able
to find food without weapons,

00:09:03.338 --> 00:09:05.315
perhaps it's because humans,

00:09:05.339 --> 00:09:08.561
as much as we like to think of ourselves
as masters of the universe,

00:09:08.585 --> 00:09:12.003
actually evolved as nothing more
than a pack of hunting dogs.

00:09:12.408 --> 00:09:15.862
Maybe we evolved as a hunting pack animal.

00:09:16.233 --> 00:09:18.809
Because the one advantage
we have in the wilderness --

00:09:18.833 --> 00:09:21.289
again, it's not our fangs,
our claws or our speed --

00:09:21.313 --> 00:09:23.638
the only thing we do really well is sweat.

00:09:23.662 --> 00:09:26.440
We're really good
at being sweaty and smelly.

00:09:26.464 --> 00:09:29.702
Better than any other mammal
on Earth, we can sweat really well.

00:09:29.726 --> 00:09:33.590
But the advantage of that little bit
of social discomfort

00:09:33.614 --> 00:09:38.721
is the fact that, when it comes to running
under hot heat for long distances,

00:09:38.745 --> 00:09:40.989
we're superb -- the best on the planet.

00:09:41.013 --> 00:09:43.098
You take a horse on a hot day,

00:09:43.122 --> 00:09:46.010
and after about five or six miles,
that horse has a choice:

00:09:46.034 --> 00:09:48.687
it's either going to breathe
or it's going to cool off.

00:09:48.711 --> 00:09:50.289
But it ain't doing both. We can.

00:09:50.678 --> 00:09:53.655
So what if we evolved
as hunting pack animals?

00:09:53.679 --> 00:09:57.304
What if the only natural advantage
we had in the world

00:09:57.328 --> 00:09:59.725
was the fact that we could
get together as a group,

00:09:59.749 --> 00:10:02.737
go out there on that African savanna,
pick out an antelope,

00:10:02.761 --> 00:10:05.270
go out as a pack,
and run that thing to death?

00:10:06.016 --> 00:10:07.472
That's all we could do.

00:10:07.496 --> 00:10:09.473
We could run really far on a hot day.

00:10:09.497 --> 00:10:12.697
Well, if that's true, a couple
other things had to be true as well.

00:10:12.721 --> 00:10:15.550
The key to being part
of a hunting pack is the word "pack."

00:10:15.574 --> 00:10:18.182
If you go out by yourself
and try to chase an antelope,

00:10:18.206 --> 00:10:21.063
I guarantee there will be two cadavers
out in the savanna.

00:10:21.087 --> 00:10:22.730
You need a pack to pull together.

00:10:22.754 --> 00:10:24.982
You need to have
those 64- and 65-year-olds

00:10:25.006 --> 00:10:26.985
who have been doing this for a long time

00:10:27.009 --> 00:10:29.501
to understand which antelope
you're trying to catch.

00:10:29.525 --> 00:10:31.626
The herd explodes
and it gathers back again.

00:10:31.650 --> 00:10:34.018
Those expert trackers
have to be part of the pack.

00:10:34.042 --> 00:10:35.506
They can't be 10 miles behind.

00:10:35.530 --> 00:10:37.714
You need the women
and the adolescents there,

00:10:37.738 --> 00:10:41.130
because the two times in your life
you most benefit from animal protein

00:10:41.154 --> 00:10:44.025
is when you're a nursing mother
and a developing adolescent.

00:10:44.049 --> 00:10:46.699
It makes no sense to have
the antelope over there, dead,

00:10:46.723 --> 00:10:48.976
and the people who want
to eat it 50 miles away.

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:50.583
They need to be part of the pack.

00:10:50.607 --> 00:10:53.444
You need those 27-year-old studs
at the peak of their powers

00:10:53.468 --> 00:10:54.624
ready to drop the kill,

00:10:54.648 --> 00:10:58.079
and you need those teenagers
who are learning the whole thing involved.

00:10:58.103 --> 00:10:59.259
The pack stays together.

00:10:59.283 --> 00:11:02.639
Another thing that has to be true:
this pack cannot be materialistic.

00:11:02.663 --> 00:11:06.092
You can't be hauling all your crap around,
trying to chase the antelope.

00:11:06.116 --> 00:11:07.602
You can't be a pissed-off pack.

00:11:07.626 --> 00:11:11.065
You can't be bearing grudges, like,
"I'm not chasing that guy's antelope.

00:11:11.089 --> 00:11:13.611
He pissed me off.
Let him go chase his own antelope."

00:11:13.635 --> 00:11:15.876
The pack has got to be able
to swallow its ego,

00:11:15.900 --> 00:11:17.678
be cooperative, and pull together.

00:11:18.019 --> 00:11:20.647
What you end up with, in other words,

00:11:20.671 --> 00:11:24.444
is a culture remarkably similar
to the Tarahumara,

00:11:24.468 --> 00:11:28.047
a tribe that has remained
unchanged since the Stone Age.

00:11:28.684 --> 00:11:30.311
It's a really compelling argument

00:11:30.335 --> 00:11:33.983
that maybe the Tarahumara are doing
exactly what all of us had done

00:11:34.007 --> 00:11:35.165
for two million years,

00:11:35.189 --> 00:11:38.233
that it's us in modern times
who have sort of gone off the path.

00:11:38.257 --> 00:11:41.538
You know, we look at running
as this kind of alien, foreign thing,

00:11:41.562 --> 00:11:45.031
this punishment you've got to do
because you ate pizza the night before.

00:11:45.055 --> 00:11:46.747
But maybe it's something different.

00:11:46.771 --> 00:11:49.868
Maybe we're the ones who have taken
this natural advantage we had

00:11:49.892 --> 00:11:51.220
and we spoiled it.

00:11:51.804 --> 00:11:54.348
How do we spoil it?
Well, how do we spoil anything?

00:11:54.372 --> 00:11:55.936
We try to cash in on it. Right?

00:11:55.960 --> 00:11:58.726
We try to can it and package it
and make it "better"

00:11:58.750 --> 00:12:00.139
and then sell it to people.

00:12:00.163 --> 00:12:02.657
And then what happened was,
we started creating

00:12:02.681 --> 00:12:06.115
these fancy cushioned things
which can make running "better,"

00:12:06.139 --> 00:12:07.555
called running shoes.

00:12:07.579 --> 00:12:10.511
The reason I get personally
pissed-off about running shoes

00:12:10.535 --> 00:12:13.512
is because I bought a million of them
and I kept getting hurt.

00:12:13.536 --> 00:12:15.513
And I think if anybody in here runs --

00:12:15.537 --> 00:12:17.317
I just had a conversation with Carol.

00:12:17.341 --> 00:12:20.972
We talked for two minutes backstage,
and she talked about plantar fasciitis.

00:12:20.996 --> 00:12:23.547
You talk to a runner,
I guarantee within 30 seconds,

00:12:23.571 --> 00:12:25.200
the conversation turns to injury.

00:12:25.224 --> 00:12:28.511
So if humans evolved as runners,
if that's our one natural advantage,

00:12:28.535 --> 00:12:30.008
then why are we so bad at it?

00:12:30.032 --> 00:12:31.643
Why do we keep getting hurt?

00:12:31.667 --> 00:12:34.039
A curious thing about running
and running injuries

00:12:34.063 --> 00:12:36.551
is that the running injury
is new to our time.

00:12:36.575 --> 00:12:38.399
If you read folklore and mythology,

00:12:38.423 --> 00:12:40.424
any kind of myths, any kind of tall tales,

00:12:40.448 --> 00:12:44.056
running is always associated
with freedom and vitality

00:12:44.080 --> 00:12:45.876
and youthfulness and eternal vigor.

00:12:45.900 --> 00:12:48.794
It's only in our lifetime
that running has become associated

00:12:48.818 --> 00:12:49.973
with fear and pain.

00:12:49.997 --> 00:12:54.108
Geronimo used to say, "My only friends
are my legs. I only trust my legs."

00:12:54.132 --> 00:12:57.751
That's because an Apache triathlon
used to be you'd run 50 miles

00:12:57.775 --> 00:12:58.926
across the desert,

00:12:58.950 --> 00:13:01.562
engage in hand-to-hand combat,
steal a bunch of horses,

00:13:01.586 --> 00:13:02.916
and slap leather for home.

00:13:02.940 --> 00:13:06.665
Geronimo was never saying, "You know
something, my Achilles -- I'm tapering.

00:13:06.689 --> 00:13:08.249
I've got to take this week off."

00:13:08.273 --> 00:13:11.290
Or, "I need to cross-train.
I didn't do yoga. I'm not ready."

00:13:11.314 --> 00:13:12.717
(Laughter)

00:13:12.741 --> 00:13:14.566
Humans ran and ran all the time.

00:13:14.590 --> 00:13:17.087
We are here today.
We have our digital technology.

00:13:17.111 --> 00:13:19.022
All of our science comes from the fact

00:13:19.046 --> 00:13:22.876
that our ancestors were able to do
something extraordinary every day,

00:13:22.900 --> 00:13:25.329
which was just rely
on their naked feet and legs

00:13:25.353 --> 00:13:26.799
to run long distances.

00:13:26.823 --> 00:13:28.622
So how do we get back to that again?

00:13:28.646 --> 00:13:30.858
Well, I would submit
to you the first thing is:

00:13:30.882 --> 00:13:33.707
get rid of all packaging,
all the sales, all the marketing.

00:13:33.731 --> 00:13:35.803
Get rid of all the stinking running shoes.

00:13:35.827 --> 00:13:37.780
Stop focusing on urban marathons,

00:13:37.804 --> 00:13:40.600
which, if you do four hours, you suck,

00:13:40.624 --> 00:13:42.577
and if you do 3:59:59, you're awesome,

00:13:42.601 --> 00:13:44.780
because you qualified for another race.

00:13:44.900 --> 00:13:47.900
We need to get back to that sense
of playfulness and joyfulness

00:13:47.924 --> 00:13:50.794
and, I would say, nakedness,

00:13:50.818 --> 00:13:52.720
that has made the Tarahumara

00:13:52.744 --> 00:13:55.323
one of the healthiest and serene
cultures in our time.

00:13:56.124 --> 00:13:57.745
So what's the benefit? So what?

00:13:57.769 --> 00:14:00.638
So you burn off the Häagen-Dazs
from the night before.

00:14:00.662 --> 00:14:03.084
But maybe there's another
benefit there as well.

00:14:03.108 --> 00:14:06.241
Without getting too extreme about this,

00:14:06.265 --> 00:14:10.876
imagine a world where everybody
could go out the door

00:14:10.900 --> 00:14:12.876
and engage in the kind of exercise

00:14:12.900 --> 00:14:15.876
that's going to make them
more relaxed, more serene,

00:14:15.900 --> 00:14:17.205
more healthy,

00:14:17.229 --> 00:14:18.541
burn off stress --

00:14:18.565 --> 00:14:21.754
where you don't come back into your office
a raging maniac anymore,

00:14:21.778 --> 00:14:24.262
or go home with a lot of stress
on top of you again.

00:14:24.286 --> 00:14:26.617
Maybe there's something
between what we are today

00:14:26.641 --> 00:14:29.149
and what the Tarahumara have always been.

00:14:29.173 --> 00:14:31.402
I don't say let's go back
to the Copper Canyons

00:14:31.426 --> 00:14:34.811
and live on corn and maize,
which is the Tarahumara's preferred diet,

00:14:34.835 --> 00:14:36.915
but maybe there's somewhere in between.

00:14:36.939 --> 00:14:38.606
And if we find that thing,

00:14:38.630 --> 00:14:41.210
maybe there is a big fat
Nobel Prize out there.

00:14:41.234 --> 00:14:46.121
Because if somebody could find a way
to restore that natural ability

00:14:46.145 --> 00:14:48.317
that we all enjoyed
for most of our existence

00:14:48.341 --> 00:14:49.912
up until the 1970s or so,

00:14:49.936 --> 00:14:55.327
the benefits -- social and physical
and political and mental --

00:14:55.351 --> 00:14:56.624
could be astounding.

00:14:56.648 --> 00:15:00.717
What I've been seeing today
is there is a growing subculture

00:15:00.741 --> 00:15:03.660
of barefoot runners,
people who've gotten rid of their shoes.

00:15:03.684 --> 00:15:05.570
And what they have found uniformly is,

00:15:05.594 --> 00:15:08.121
you get rid of the shoes,
you get rid of the stress,

00:15:08.145 --> 00:15:10.613
you get rid of the injuries
and the ailments.

00:15:10.637 --> 00:15:13.427
And what you find is something
the Tarahumara have known

00:15:13.451 --> 00:15:14.616
for a very long time:

00:15:14.640 --> 00:15:16.402
that this can be a whole lot of fun.

00:15:16.426 --> 00:15:18.253
I've experienced it personally myself.

00:15:18.277 --> 00:15:21.633
I was injured all my life; then
in my early 40s, I got rid of my shoes

00:15:21.657 --> 00:15:23.876
and my running ailments
have gone away, too.

00:15:23.900 --> 00:15:26.458
So hopefully it's something
we can all benefit from.

00:15:26.482 --> 00:15:28.524
I appreciate your listening to this story.

00:15:28.548 --> 00:15:29.699
Thanks very much.

00:15:29.723 --> 00:15:31.714
(Applause)
