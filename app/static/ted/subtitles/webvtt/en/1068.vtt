00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.000
"What I Will"

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
I will not dance to your war drum.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
I will not lend my soul nor my bones to your war drum.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
I will not dance to that beating.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
I know that beat.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
It is lifeless.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
I know intimately that skin you are hitting.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
It was alive once,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
hunted, stolen,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
stretched.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
I will not dance to your drummed-up war.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
I will not pop, spin, break for you.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
I will not hate for you

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
or even hate you.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
I will not kill for you.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000
Especially I will not die for you.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
I will not mourn the dead with murder nor suicide.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
I will not side with you or dance to bombs

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
because everyone is dancing.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
Everyone can be wrong.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Life is a right, not collateral or casual.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
I will not forget where I come from.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
I will craft my own drum.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
Gather my beloved near,

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
and our chanting will be dancing.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
Our humming will be drumming.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
I will not be played.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.000
I will not lend my name nor my rhythm to your beat.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.000
I will dance and resist and dance and persist and dance.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
This heartbeat is louder than death.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
Your war drum ain't louder

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.000
than this breath. Haaa.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
What's up TED people? Let me hear you make some noise.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
(Applause)

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
A bunch of pacifists.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
Confused, aspiring pacifists.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
I understand.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
I've been wrong a lot lately.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
Like a lot.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
So I couldn't figure out

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
what to read today.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
I mean, I've been saying I've been prepping.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
What that means is prepping my outfit,

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
(Laughter)

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
prepping options,

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
trying to figure out what I'm coming behind

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
and going in front of.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
Poetry does that.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
It preps you. It aims you.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
So I am going to read a poem

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
that was chosen just now.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
But I'm going to need you

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
to just sit for like 10 minutes

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000
and hold a woman who is not here.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000
Hold her now

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
with you.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
You don't need to say her name out loud, you can just hold her.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
Are you holding her?

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000
This is "Break Clustered."

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.000
All holy history banned.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.000
Unwritten books predicted the future, projected the past.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
But my head unwraps

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
around what appears limitless,

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
man's creative violence.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
Whose son shall it be?

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.000
Which male child will perish a new day?

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000
Our boys' deaths galvanize.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
We cherish corpses.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
We mourn women, complicated.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
Bitches get beat daily.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000
Profits made, prophets ignored.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000
War and tooth, enameled salted lemon childhoods.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000
All colors run, none of us solid.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000
Don't look for shadow behind me. I carry it within.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.000
I live cycles of light and darkness.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
Rhythm is half silence.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
I see now, I never was one and not the other.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.000
Sickness, health, tender violence.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000
I think now I never was pure.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000
Before form I was storm,

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000
blind, ign'ant -- still am.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000
Human contracted itself blind, malignant.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000
I never was pure.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.000
Girl spoiled before ripened.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000
Language can't math me.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000
I experience exponentially.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
Everything is everything.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.000
One woman loses 15, maybe 20, members of her family.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000
One woman loses six.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000
One woman loses her head.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.000
One woman searches rubble. One woman feeds on trash.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.000
One woman shoots her face. One woman shoots her husband.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000
One woman straps herself.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000
One woman gives birth to a baby.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000
One woman gives birth to borders.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.000
One woman no longer believes love will ever find her.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000
One woman never did.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.000
Where do refugee hearts go?

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000
Broken, dissed,

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000
placed where they're not from, don't want to be missed.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
Faced with absence.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000
We mourn each one

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000
or we mean nothing at all.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.000
My spine curves spiral.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:43.000
Precipice running to and running from human beings.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000
Cluster bombs left behind.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000
De facto landmines.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000
A smoldering grief.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.000
Harvest contaminated tobacco.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000
Harvest bombs.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000
Harvest baby teeth.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.000
Harvest palms, smoke.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.000
Harvest witness, smoke.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.000
Resolutions, smoke.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.000
Salvation, smoke.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000
Redemption, smoke.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000
Breathe.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000
Do not fear

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.000
what has blown up.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.000
If you must,

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:25.000
fear the unexploded.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000
Thank you.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:31.000
(Applause)
