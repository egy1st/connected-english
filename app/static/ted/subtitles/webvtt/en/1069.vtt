WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
What I thought I would do

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
is I would start with a simple request.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
I'd like all of you

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
to pause for a moment,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
you wretched weaklings,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
and take stock of your miserable existence.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
(Laughter)

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Now that was the advice

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
that St. Benedict gave his rather startled followers

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
in the fifth century.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
It was the advice that I decided to follow myself

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
when I turned 40.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Up until that moment, I had been that classic corporate warrior --

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
I was eating too much, I was drinking too much,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
I was working too hard

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
and I was neglecting the family.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
And I decided that I would try

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
and turn my life around.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
In particular, I decided

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
I would try to address the thorny issue

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
of work-life balance.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
So I stepped back from the workforce,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
and I spent a year at home

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
with my wife and four young children.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
But all I learned about work-life balance

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
from that year

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
was that I found it quite easy

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
to balance work and life

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
when I didn't have any work.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
(Laughter)

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
Not a very useful skill,

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
especially when the money runs out.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
So I went back to work,

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
and I've spent these seven years since

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
struggling with, studying

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
and writing about work-life balance.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
And I have four observations

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
I'd like to share with you today.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
The first is:

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
if society's to make any progress on this issue,

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
we need an honest debate.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
But the trouble is

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
so many people talk so much rubbish

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
about work-life balance.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
All the discussions about flexi-time

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000
or dress-down Fridays

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
or paternity leave

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
only serve to mask the core issue,

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
which is

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
that certain job and career choices

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
are fundamentally incompatible

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
with being meaningfully engaged

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
on a day-to-day basis

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
with a young family.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
Now the first step in solving any problem

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
is acknowledging the reality of the situation you're in.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.000
And the reality of the society that we're in

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
is there are thousands and thousands

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
of people out there

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.000
leading lives of quiet, screaming desperation,

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
where they work long, hard hours

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
at jobs they hate

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
to enable them to buy things they don't need

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
to impress people they don't like.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000
(Laughter)

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000
(Applause)

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.000
It's my contention that going to work on Friday in jeans and [a] T-shirt

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
isn't really getting to the nub of the issue.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000
(Laughter)

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
The second observation I'd like to make

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
is we need to face the truth

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
that governments and corporations

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000
aren't going to solve this issue for us.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
We should stop looking outside.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
It's up to us as individuals

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
to take control and responsibility

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000
for the type of lives that we want to lead.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
If you don't design your life,

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000
someone else will design it for you,

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
and you may just not like

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
their idea of balance.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000
It's particularly important --

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
this isn't on the World Wide Web, is it? I'm about to get fired --

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
it's particularly important

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.000
that you never put the quality of your life

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.000
in the hands of a commercial corporation.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000
Now I'm not talking here just about the bad companies --

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.000
the "abattoirs of the human soul," as I call them.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000
(Laughter)

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.000
I'm talking about all companies.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000
Because commercial companies

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000
are inherently designed

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000
to get as much out of you [as]

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000
they can get away with.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000
It's in their nature; it's in their DNA;

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000
it's what they do --

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000
even the good, well-intentioned companies.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000
On the one hand,

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000
putting childcare facilities in the workplace

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000
is wonderful and enlightened.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000
On the other hand, it's a nightmare --

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000
it just means you spend more time at the bloody office.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000
We have to be responsible

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000
for setting and enforcing

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.000
the boundaries that we want in our life.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000
The third observation is

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000
we have to be careful

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.000
with the time frame that we choose

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.000
upon which to judge our balance.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000
Before I went back to work

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000
after my year at home,

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000
I sat down

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000
and I wrote out

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.000
a detailed, step-by-step description

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.000
of the ideal balanced day

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000
that I aspired to.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.000
And it went like this:

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000
wake up well rested

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000
after a good night's sleep.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000
Have sex.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000
Walk the dog.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.000
Have breakfast with my wife and children.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000
Have sex again.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000
(Laughter)

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.000
Drive the kids to school on the way to the office.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000
Do three hours' work.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.000
Play a sport with a friend at lunchtime.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000
Do another three hours' work.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.000
Meet some mates in the pub for an early evening drink.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000
Drive home for dinner

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.000
with my wife and kids.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.000
Meditate for half an hour.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.000
Have sex.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.000
Walk the dog. Have sex again.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.000
Go to bed.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:44.000
(Applause)

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000
How often do you think I have that day?

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.000
(Laughter)

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000
We need to be realistic.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000
You can't do it all in one day.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.000
We need to elongate the time frame

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000
upon which we judge the balance in our life,

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000
but we need to elongate it

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000
without falling into the trap

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.000
of the "I'll have a life when I retire,

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000
when my kids have left home,

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.000
when my wife has divorced me, my health is failing,

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000
I've got no mates or interests left."

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000
(Laughter)

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.000
A day is too short; "after I retire" is too long.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.000
There's got to be a middle way.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.000
A fourth observation:

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.000
We need to approach balance

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:28.000
in a balanced way.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000
A friend came to see me last year --

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.000
and she doesn't mind me telling this story -- a friend came to see me last year

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.000
and said, "Nigel, I've read your book.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.000
And I realize that my life is completely out of balance.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.000
It's totally dominated by work.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.000
I work 10 hours a day; I commute two hours a day.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.000
All of my relationships have failed.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.000
There's nothing in my life

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.000
apart from my work.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.000
So I've decided to get a grip and sort it out.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000
So I joined a gym."

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.000
(Laughter)

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:01.000
Now I don't mean to mock,

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:05.000
but being a fit 10-hour-a-day office rat

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:08.000
isn't more balanced; it's more fit.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.000
(Laughter)

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.000
Lovely though physical exercise may be,

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000
there are other parts to life --

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.000
there's the intellectual side; there's the emotional side;

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.000
there's the spiritual side.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.000
And to be balanced,

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.000
I believe we have to attend

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.000
to all of those areas --

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:28.000
not just do 50 stomach crunches.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000
Now that can be daunting.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.000
Because people say, "Bloody hell mate, I haven't got time to get fit.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.000
You want me to go to church and call my mother."

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.000
And I understand.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:40.000
I truly understand how that can be daunting.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.000
But an incident that happened a couple of years ago

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.000
gave me a new perspective.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.000
My wife, who is somewhere in the audience today,

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:51.000
called me up at the office

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:54.000
and said, "Nigel, you need to pick our youngest son" --

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.000
Harry -- "up from school."

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:59.000
Because she had to be somewhere else with the other three children for that evening.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:02.000
So I left work an hour early that afternoon

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:05.000
and picked Harry up at the school gates.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.000
We walked down to the local park,

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:11.000
messed around on the swings, played some silly games.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:14.000
I then walked him up the hill to the local cafe,

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:17.000
and we shared a pizza for two,

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.000
then walked down the hill to our home,

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.000
and I gave him his bath

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:24.000
and put him in his Batman pajamas.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000
I then read him a chapter

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:29.000
of Roald Dahl's "James and the Giant Peach."

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000
I then put him to bed, tucked him in,

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.000
gave him a kiss on his forehead and said, "Goodnight, mate,"

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.000
and walked out of his bedroom.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.000
As I was walking out of his bedroom,

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:40.000
he said, "Dad?" I went, "Yes, mate?"

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000
He went, "Dad, this has been the best day

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.000
of my life, ever."

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:50.000
I hadn't done anything,

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:53.000
hadn't taken him to Disney World or bought him a Playstation.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.000
Now my point is

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:58.000
the small things matter.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.000
Being more balanced

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.000
doesn't mean dramatic upheaval in your life.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.000
With the smallest investment

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.000
in the right places,

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:10.000
you can radically transform the quality of your relationships

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.000
and the quality of your life.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.000
Moreover, I think,

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:17.000
it can transform society.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.000
Because if enough people do it,

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:22.000
we can change society's definition of success

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:25.000
away from the moronically simplistic notion

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:29.000
that the person with the most money when he dies wins,

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:32.000
to a more thoughtful and balanced definition

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:36.000
of what a life well lived looks like.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.000
And that, I think,

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.000
is an idea worth spreading.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:43.000
