00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Hawa Abdi: Many people -- 20 years for Somalia --

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
[were] fighting.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
So there was no job, no food.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Children, most of them,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
became very malnourished, like this.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Deqo Mohamed: So as you know,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
always in a civil war,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
the ones affected most [are] the women and children.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
So our patients are women and children.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
And they are in our backyard.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
It's our home. We welcome them.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
That's the camp that we have in now

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
90,000 people,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
where 75 percent of them are women and children.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Pat Mitchell: And this is your hospital. This is the inside.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
HA: We are doing C-sections and different operations

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
because people need some help.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
There is no government to protect them.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
DM: Every morning we have about 400 patients,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
maybe more or less.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
But sometimes we are only five doctors

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
and 16 nurses,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000
and we are physically getting exhausted to see all of them.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
But we take the severe ones,

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
and we reschedule the other ones the next day.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
It is very tough.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
And as you can see, it's the women who are carrying the children;

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
it's the women who come into the hospitals;

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
it's the women [are] building the houses.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
That's their house.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
And we have a school. This is our bright --

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
we opened [in the] last two years [an] elementary school

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
where we have 850 children,

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
and the majority are women and girls.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:36.000
(Applause)

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
PM: And the doctors have some very big rules

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
about who can get treated at the clinic.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
Would you explain the rules for admission?

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
HA: The people who are coming to us,

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
we are welcoming.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
We are sharing with them

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
whatever we have.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
But there are only two rules.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
First rule:

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000
there is no clan distinguished and political division

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
in Somali society.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
[Whomever] makes those things we throw out.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
The second:

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
no man can beat his wife.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
If he beat,

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
we will put [him] in jail,

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000
and we will call the eldest people.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000
Until they identify this case,

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
we'll never release him.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
That's our two rules.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:28.000
(Applause)

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000
The other thing that I have realized,

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000
that the woman is the most strong person

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
all over the world.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
Because the last 20 years,

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000
the Somali woman has stood up.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
They were the leaders,

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
and we are the leaders

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
of our community

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
and the hope of our future generations.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
We are not just the helpless

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
and the victims of the civil war.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
We can reconcile.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
We can do everything.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:03.000
(Applause)

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000
DM: As my mother said, we are the future hope,

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000
and the men are only killing in Somalia.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
So we came up with these two rules.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000
In a camp with 90,000 people,

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000
you have to come up with some rules or there is going to be some fights.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
So there is no clan division,

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
and no man can beat his wife.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
And we have a little storage room

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000
where we converted a jail.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000
So if you beat your wife, you're going to be there.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
(Applause)

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
So empowering the women and giving the opportunity --

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.000
we are there for them. They are not alone for this.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000
PM: You're running a medical clinic.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000
It brought much, much needed medical care

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000
to people who wouldn't get it.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000
You're also running a civil society.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000
You've created your own rules,

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000
in which women and children

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.000
are getting a different sense of security.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.000
Talk to me about your decision, Dr. Abdi,

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000
and your decision, Dr. Mohamed,

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000
to work together --

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
for you to become a doctor

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.000
and to work with your mother in these circumstances.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000
HA: My age --

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.000
because I was born in 1947 --

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000
we were having, at that time,

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000
government, law and order.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.000
But one day, I went to the hospital --

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000
my mother was sick --

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.000
and I saw the hospital, how they [were] treating the doctors,

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000
how they [are] committed

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.000
to help the sick people.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
I admired them,

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
and I decided to become a doctor.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
My mother died, unfortunately,

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000
when I was 12 years [old].

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.000
Then my father allowed me

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.000
to proceed [with] my hope.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000
My mother died

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000
in [a] gynecology complication,

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000
so I decided to become

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.000
a gynecology specialist.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.000
That's why I became a doctor.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.000
So Dr. Deqo has to explain.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.000
DM: For me, my mother was preparing [me] when I was a child

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.000
to become a doctor, but I really didn't want to.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000
Maybe I should become an historian,

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000
or maybe a reporter.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000
I loved it, but it didn't work.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000
When the war broke out -- civil war --

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000
I saw how my mother was helping

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000
and how she really needed the help,

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.000
and how the care is essential to the woman

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000
to be a woman doctor in Somalia

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000
and help the women and children.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.000
And I thought, maybe I can be a reporter and doctor gynecologist.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000
(Laughter)

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000
So I went to Russia, and my mother also,

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000
[during the] time of [the] Soviet Union.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000
So some of our character,

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.000
maybe we will come with a strong Soviet background of training.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000
So that's how I decided [to do] the same.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000
My sister was different.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000
She's here. She's also a doctor.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000
She graduated in Russia also.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000
(Applause)

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.000
And to go back and to work with our mother

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000
is just what we saw in the civil war --

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.000
when I was 16, and my sister was 11,

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.000
when the civil war broke out.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.000
So it was the need and the people we saw

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000
in the early '90s --

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.000
that's what made us go back

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.000
and work for them.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.000
PM: So what is the biggest challenge

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000
working, mother and daughter,

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000
in such dangerous

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.000
and sometimes scary situations?

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:20.000
HA: Yes, I was working in a tough situation,

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.000
very dangerous.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.000
And when I saw the people who needed me,

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000
I was staying with them to help,

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.000
because I [could] do something for them.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:35.000
Most people fled abroad.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.000
But I remained with those people,

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.000
and I was trying to do something --

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.000
[any] little thing I [could] do.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.000
I succeeded in my place.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:51.000
Now my place is 90,000 people

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000
who are respecting each other,

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.000
who are not fighting.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:00.000
But we try to stand on our feet,

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:04.000
to do something, little things, we can for our people.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:07.000
And I'm thankful for my daughters.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000
When they come to me,

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000
they help me to treat the people,

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.000
to help.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000
They do everything for them.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.000
They have done what I desire to do for them.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.000
PM: What's the best part

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.000
of working with your mother,

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:26.000
and the most challenging part for you?

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.000
DM: She's very tough; it's most challenging.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:32.000
She always expects us to do more.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.000
And really when you think [you] cannot do it,

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000
she will push you, and I can do it.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.000
That's the best part.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.000
She shows us, trains us how to do

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.000
and how to be better [people]

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.000
and how to do long hours in surgery --

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:47.000
300 patients per day,

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.000
10, 20 surgeries,

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.000
and still you have to manage the camp --

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:54.000
that's how she trains us.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.000
It is not like beautiful offices here,

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.000
20 patients, you're tired.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:01.000
You see 300 patients, 20 surgeries

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:04.000
and 90,000 people to manage.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.000
PM: But you do it for good reasons.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:10.000
(Applause)

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000
Wait. Wait.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.000
HA: Thank you.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.000
DM: Thank you.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:20.000
(Applause)

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.000
HA: Thank you very much. DM: Thank you very much.
