WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
I'd like to start with a couple of quick examples.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
These are spinneret glands

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
on the abdomen of a spider.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
They produce six different types of silk, which is spun together into a fiber,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
tougher than any fiber humans have ever made.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
The nearest we've come is with aramid fiber.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
And to make that, it involves extremes of temperature,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
extremes of pressure and loads of pollution.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
And yet the spider manages to do it at ambient temperature and pressure

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
with raw materials of dead flies and water.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
It does suggest we've still got a bit to learn.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
This beetle can detect a forest fire at 80 kilometers away.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
That's roughly 10,000 times the range

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
of man-made fire detectors.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
And what's more, this guy doesn't need a wire

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
connected all the way back to a power station burning fossil fuels.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
So these two examples give a sense of what biomimicry can deliver.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
If we could learn to make things and do things the way nature does,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
we could achieve factor 10, factor 100,

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
maybe even factor 1,000 savings

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
in resource and energy use.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
And if we're to make progress with the sustainability revolution,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
I believe there are three really big changes

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
we need to bring about.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
Firstly, radical increases in resource efficiency.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
Secondly, shifting from a linear, wasteful,

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
polluting way of using resources

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
to a closed-loop model.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
And thirdly, changing from a fossil fuel economy

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
to a solar economy.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
And for all three of these, I believe,

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
biomimicry has a lot of the solutions that we're going to need.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
You could look at nature as being like a catalog of products,

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
and all of those have benefited

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
from a 3.8-billion-year research and development period.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
And given that level of investment, it makes sense to use it.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
So I'm going to talk about some projects that have explored these ideas.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
And let's start with radical increases

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
in resource efficiency.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
When we were working on the Eden Project,

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
we had to create a very large greenhouse

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
in a site that was not only irregular,

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
but it was continually changing because it was still being quarried.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
It was a hell of a challenge,

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
and it was actually examples from biology

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
that provided a lot of the clues.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
So for instance,

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
it was soap bubbles that helped us generate a building form

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000
that would work regardless of the final ground levels.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
Studying pollen grains

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
and radiolaria and carbon molecules

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
helped us devise the most efficient structural solution

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
using hexagons and pentagons.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
The next move was that we wanted

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
to try and maximize the size of those hexagons.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
And to do that we had to find an alternative to glass,

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
which is really very limited in terms of its unit sizes.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
And in nature there are lots of examples

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
of very efficient structures based on pressurized membranes.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
So we started exploring this material called ETFE.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
It's a high-strength polymer.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
And what you do is you put it together in three layers,

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000
you weld it around the edge, and then you inflate it.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
And the great thing about this stuff

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
is you can make it in units

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000
of roughly seven times the size of glass,

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
and it was only one percent of the weight of double-glazing.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
So that was a factor-100 saving.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000
And what we found is that we got into a positive cycle

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
in which one breakthrough facilitated another.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000
So with such large, lightweight pillows,

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
we had much less steel.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
With less steel we were getting more sunlight in,

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000
which meant we didn't have to put as much extra heat in winter.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
And with less overall weight in the superstructure,

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000
there were big savings in the foundations.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000
And at the end of the project we worked out

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000
that the weight of that superstructure

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000
was actually less than the weight of the air inside the building.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000
So I think the Eden Project is a fairly good example

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
of how ideas from biology

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000
can lead to radical increases in resource efficiency --

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000
delivering the same function,

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000
but with a fraction of the resource input.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
And actually there are loads of examples in nature

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000
that you could turn to for similar solutions.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
So for instance, you could develop super-efficient roof structures

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000
based on giant Amazon water lilies,

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000
whole buildings inspired by abalone shells,

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000
super-lightweight bridges inspired by plant cells.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.000
There's a world of beauty and efficiency to explore here

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.000
using nature as a design tool.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000
So now I want to go onto talking about the linear-to-closed-loop idea.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000
The way we tend to use resources

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000
is we extract them,

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000
we turn them into short-life products and then dispose of them.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000
Nature works very differently.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000
In ecosystems, the waste from one organism

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
becomes the nutrient for something else in that system.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
And there are some examples of projects

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.000
that have deliberately tried to mimic ecosystems.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000
And one of my favorites

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000
is called the Cardboard to Caviar Project

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000
by Graham Wiles.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.000
And in their area they had a lot of shops and restaurants

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.000
that were producing lots of food, cardboard and plastic waste.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000
It was ending up in landfills.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000
Now the really clever bit is what they did with the cardboard waste.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.000
And I'm just going to talk through this animation.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.000
So they were paid to collect it from the restaurants.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000
They then shredded the cardboard

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000
and sold it to equestrian centers as horse bedding.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
When that was soiled, they were paid again to collect it.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000
They put it into worm recomposting systems,

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.000
which produced a lot of worms, which they fed to Siberian sturgeon,

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.000
which produced caviar, which they sold back to the restaurants.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000
So it transformed a linear process

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000
into a closed-loop model,

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.000
and it created more value in the process.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000
Graham Wiles has continued to add more and more elements to this,

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.000
turning waste streams into schemes that create value.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000
And just as natural systems

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000
tend to increase in diversity and resilience over time,

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000
there's a real sense with this project

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.000
that the number of possibilities

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000
just continue increasing.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000
And I know it's a quirky example,

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000
but I think the implications of this are quite radical,

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000
because it suggests that we could actually

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.000
transform a big problem -- waste -- into a massive opportunity.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000
And particularly in cities --

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000
we could look at the whole metabolism of cities,

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000
and look at those as opportunities.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000
And that's what we're doing on the next project I'm going to talk about,

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000
the Mobius Project,

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000
where we're trying to bring together a number of activities,

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000
all within one building,

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000
so that the waste from one can be the nutrient for another.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000
And the kind of elements I'm talking about

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.000
are, firstly, we have a restaurant inside a productive greenhouse,

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000
a bit like this one in Amsterdam called De Kas.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000
Then we would have an anaerobic digester,

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.000
which could deal with all the biodegradable waste from the local area,

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.000
turn that into heat for the greenhouse

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000
and electricity to feed back into the grid.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.000
We'd have a water treatment system

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000
treating wastewater, turning that into fresh water

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000
and generating energy from the solids

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.000
using just plants and micro-organisms.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000
We'd have a fish farm fed with vegetable waste from the kitchen

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.000
and worms from the compost

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000
and supplying fish back to the restaurant.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.000
And we'd also have a coffee shop, and the waste grains from that

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.000
could be used as a substrate for growing mushrooms.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000
So you can see that we're bringing together

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000
cycles of food, energy and water and waste

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000
all within one building.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.000
And just for fun, we've proposed this for a roundabout in central London,

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000
which at the moment is a complete eyesore.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.000
Some of you may recognize this.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.000
And with just a little bit of planning,

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.000
we could transform a space dominated by traffic

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.000
into one that provides open space for people,

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000
reconnects people with food

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.000
and transforms waste into closed loop opportunities.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000
So the final project I want to talk about

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.000
is the Sahara Forest Project, which we're working on at the moment.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000
It may come as a surprise to some of you

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.000
to hear that quite large areas of what are currently desert

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.000
were actually forested a fairly short time ago.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.000
So for instance, when Julius Caesar arrived in North Africa,

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000
huge areas of North Africa

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000
were covered in cedar and cypress forests.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000
And during the evolution of life on the Earth,

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000
it was the colonization

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.000
of the land by plants

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000
that helped create the benign climate we currently enjoy.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000
The converse is also true.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000
The more vegetation we lose,

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.000
the more that's likely to exacerbate climate change

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.000
and lead to further desertification.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000
And this animation,

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.000
this shows photosynthetic activity over the course of a number of years,

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.000
and what you can see is that the boundaries of those deserts

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.000
shift quite a lot,

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.000
and that raises the question

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.000
of whether we can intervene at the boundary conditions

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.000
to halt, or maybe even reverse, desertification.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000
And if you look at some of the organisms

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000
that have evolved to live in deserts,

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:34.000
there are some amazing examples of adaptations to water scarcity.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000
This is the Namibian fog-basking beetle,

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.000
and it's evolved a way of harvesting its own fresh water in a desert.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.000
The way it does this is it comes out at night,

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.000
crawls to the top of a sand dune,

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.000
and because it's got a matte black shell,

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.000
is able to radiate heat out to the night sky

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.000
and become slightly cooler than its surroundings.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.000
So when the moist breeze blows in off the sea,

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:54.000
you get these droplets of water forming on the beetle's shell.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.000
Just before sunrise, he tips his shell up, the water runs down into his mouth,

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.000
has a good drink, goes off and hides for the rest of the day.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.000
And the ingenuity, if you could call it that,

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.000
goes even further.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.000
Because if you look closely at the beetle's shell,

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.000
there are lots of little bumps on that shell.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:10.000
And those bumps are hydrophilic; they attract water.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:13.000
Between them there's a waxy finish which repels water.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.000
And the effect of this is that

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.000
as the droplets start to form on the bumps,

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.000
they stay in tight, spherical beads,

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.000
which means they're much more mobile

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:24.000
than they would be if it was just a film of water over the whole beetle's shell.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.000
So even when there's only a small amount of moisture in the air,

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:30.000
it's able to harvest that very effectively and channel it down to its mouth.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000
So amazing example of an adaptation

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.000
to a very resource-constrained environment --

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.000
and in that sense, very relevant

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.000
to the kind of challenges we're going to be facing

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.000
over the next few years, next few decades.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000
We're working with the guy who invented the Seawater Greenhouse.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.000
This is a greenhouse designed for arid coastal regions,

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:49.000
and the way it works is that you have this whole wall of evaporator grills,

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000
and you trickle seawater over that

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.000
so that wind blows through, it picks up a lot of moisture

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.000
and is cooled in the process.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.000
So inside it's cool and humid,

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.000
which means the plants need less water to grow.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.000
And then at the back of the greenhouse,

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:04.000
it condenses a lot of that humidity as freshwater

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:07.000
in a process that is effectively identical to the beetle.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:10.000
And what they found with the first Seawater Greenhouse that was built

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.000
was it was producing slightly more freshwater

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.000
than it needed for the plants inside.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:18.000
So they just started spreading this on the land around,

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.000
and the combination of that and the elevated humidity

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:23.000
had quite a dramatic effect on the local area.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.000
This photograph was taken on completion day,

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.000
and just one year later, it looked like that.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:30.000
So it was like a green inkblot spreading out from the building

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:33.000
turning barren land back into biologically productive land --

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.000
and in that sense, going beyond sustainable design

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.000
to achieve restorative design.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.000
So we were keen to scale this up

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:42.000
and apply biomimicry ideas to maximize the benefits.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:44.000
And when you think about nature,

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.000
often you think about it as being all about competition.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.000
But actually in mature ecosystems,

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.000
you're just as likely to find examples

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.000
of symbiotic relationships.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.000
So an important biomimicry principle

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.000
is to find ways of bringing technologies together

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.000
in symbiotic clusters.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.000
And the technology that we settled on

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.000
as an ideal partner for the Seawater Greenhouse

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.000
is concentrated solar power,

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.000
which uses solar-tracking mirrors to focus the sun's heat

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.000
to create electricity.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:11.000
And just to give you some sense of the potential of CSP,

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.000
consider that we receive

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:16.000
10,000 times as much energy from the sun every year

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.000
as we use in energy from all forms --

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.000
10,000 times.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.000
So our energy problems are not intractable.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.000
It's a challenge to our ingenuity.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.000
And the kind of synergies I'm talking about

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:30.000
are, firstly, both these technologies work very well in hot, sunny deserts.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:33.000
CSP needs a supply of demineralized freshwater.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.000
That's exactly what the Seawater Greenhouse produces.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.000
CSP produces a lot of waste heat.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:40.000
We'll be able to make use of all that to evaporate more seawater

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.000
and enhance the restorative benefits.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.000
And finally, in the shade under the mirrors,

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.000
it's possible to grow all sorts of crops

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.000
that would not grow in direct sunlight.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.000
So this is how this scheme would look.

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:53.000
The idea is we create this long hedge of greenhouses facing the wind.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.000
We'd have concentrated solar power plants

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.000
at intervals along the way.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:00.000
Some of you might be wondering what we would do with all the salts.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:03.000
And with biomimicry, if you've got an underutilized resource,

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:05.000
you don't think, "How am I going to dispose of this?"

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:08.000
You think, "What can I add to the system to create more value?"

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.000
And it turns out

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.000
that different things crystallize out at different stages.

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.000
When you evaporate seawater, the first thing to crystallize out

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.000
is calcium carbonate.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.000
And that builds up on the evaporators --

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.000
and that's what that image on the left is --

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.000
gradually getting encrusted with the calcium carbonate.

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.000
So after a while, we could take that out,

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.000
use it as a lightweight building block.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.000
And if you think about the carbon in that,

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.000
that would have come out of the atmosphere, into the sea

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.000
and then locked away in a building product.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.000
The next thing is sodium chloride.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.000
You can also compress that into a building block,

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.000
as they did here.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.000
This is a hotel in Bolivia.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:42.000
And then after that, there are all sorts

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:44.000
of compounds and elements that we can extract,

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:47.000
like phosphates, that we need to get back into the desert soils to fertilize them.

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.000
And there's just about every element of the periodic table

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.000
in seawater.

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.000
So it should be possible to extract valuable elements

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:56.000
like lithium for high-performance batteries.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:00.000
And in parts of the Arabian Gulf,

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:03.000
the seawater, the salinity is increasing steadily

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:05.000
due to the discharge of waste brine

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:07.000
from desalination plants.

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:10.000
And it's pushing the ecosystem close to collapse.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.000
Now we would be able to make use of all that waste brine.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.000
We could evaporate it

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.000
to enhance the restorative benefits

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.000
and capture the salts,

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:21.000
transforming an urgent waste problem into a big opportunity.

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:23.000
Really the Sahara Forest Project is a model

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:26.000
for how we could create zero-carbon food,

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:29.000
abundant renewable energy in some of the most water-stressed parts of the planet

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:33.000
as well as reversing desertification in certain areas.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:36.000
So returning to those big challenges that I mentioned at the beginning:

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.000
radical increases in resource efficiency,

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.000
closing loops and a solar economy.

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:43.000
They're not just possible; they're critical.

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:46.000
And I firmly believe that studying the way nature solves problems

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:49.000
will provide a lot of the solutions.

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:52.000
But perhaps more than anything, what this thinking provides

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.000
is a really positive way of talking about sustainable design.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.000
Far too much of the talk about the environment

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.000
uses very negative language.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:01.000
But here it's about synergies and abundance and optimizing.

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:03.000
And this is an important point.

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:05.000
Antoine de Saint-Exupery once said,

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:07.000
"If you want to build a flotilla of ships,

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:09.000
you don't sit around talking about carpentry.

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:12.000
No, you need to set people's souls ablaze

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.000
with visions of exploring distant shores."

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:17.000
And that's what we need to do, so let's be positive,

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:19.000
and let's make progress with what could be

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:21.000
the most exciting period of innovation we've ever seen.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.000
Thank you.

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:25.000
(Applause)
