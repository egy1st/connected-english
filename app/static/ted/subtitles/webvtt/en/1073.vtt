00:00:00.817 --> 00:00:04.817
(Whistling)

00:02:00.784 --> 00:02:03.333
(Whistling ends)

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:07.479
(Applause)

00:02:07.503 --> 00:02:08.976
Thank you.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.576
(Applause)

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:12.976
Thank you very much.

00:02:13.734 --> 00:02:15.073
That was whistling.

00:02:15.097 --> 00:02:18.976
I'm trying to do this in English.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:24.092
What is a chubby,
curly-haired guy from Holland --

00:02:24.231 --> 00:02:25.749
why is he whistling?

00:02:25.773 --> 00:02:29.204
Well actually, I've been whistling
since the age of four, about four.

00:02:29.228 --> 00:02:31.394
My dad was always whistling
around the house,

00:02:31.418 --> 00:02:34.485
and I just thought that's part
of communication in my family.

00:02:34.509 --> 00:02:36.208
So I whistled along with him.

00:02:36.232 --> 00:02:39.695
And actually, until I was 34,

00:02:39.719 --> 00:02:44.259
I always annoyed and irritated
people with whistling,

00:02:44.283 --> 00:02:45.976
because, to be honest,

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.841
my whistling is a kind
of deviant behavior.

00:02:50.309 --> 00:02:53.574
I whistled alone,
I whistled in the classroom,

00:02:53.598 --> 00:02:56.168
I whistled on bike, I whistled everywhere.

00:02:56.308 --> 00:02:59.688
And I also whistled
at a Christmas Eve party

00:02:59.712 --> 00:03:01.433
with my family-in-law.

00:03:01.457 --> 00:03:06.139
And they had some, in my opinion,
terrible Christmas music.

00:03:06.163 --> 00:03:09.901
And when I hear music that I don't like,
I try to make it better.

00:03:09.925 --> 00:03:11.307
(Laughter)

00:03:11.331 --> 00:03:14.811
So when "Rudolph the Red-Nosed
Reindeer" -- you know it?

00:03:14.835 --> 00:03:17.741
(Whistling)

00:03:17.765 --> 00:03:19.467
But it can also sound like this.

00:03:19.491 --> 00:03:22.614
(Whistling)

00:03:22.638 --> 00:03:25.596
But during a Christmas party --

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:27.833
at dinner, actually -- it's very annoying.

00:03:27.857 --> 00:03:32.316
So my sister-in-law asked me a few times,
"Please stop whistling."

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:33.628
And I just couldn't.

00:03:33.652 --> 00:03:34.853
And at one point --

00:03:34.877 --> 00:03:37.089
and I had some wine,
I have to admit that --

00:03:37.113 --> 00:03:40.388
at one point I said,
"If there was a contest, I would join."

00:03:40.412 --> 00:03:41.854
And two weeks later,

00:03:41.878 --> 00:03:45.286
I received a text message:
"You're going to America."

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:46.976
(Laughter)

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:50.048
So, OK, I'm going to America.

00:03:50.072 --> 00:03:51.676
I would love to, but why?

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:53.857
So I immediately called her up, of course.

00:03:53.881 --> 00:03:58.463
She googled, and she found
this World Whistling Championship

00:03:58.487 --> 00:04:00.264
in America, of course.

00:04:00.288 --> 00:04:01.438
(Laughter)

00:04:02.618 --> 00:04:04.976
She didn't expect me to go there.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.139
And I would have lost my face.

00:04:08.163 --> 00:04:10.149
I don't know if that's correct English.

00:04:10.173 --> 00:04:12.699
But the Dutch people here
will understand what I mean.

00:04:12.723 --> 00:04:15.182
(Laughter)

00:04:15.206 --> 00:04:16.976
I lost my face.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.976
(Applause)

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.592
And she thought, "He will never go there."

00:04:22.616 --> 00:04:24.202
But actually, I did.

00:04:24.226 --> 00:04:29.771
So I went to Louisburg, North Carolina,
southeast of the United States,

00:04:29.795 --> 00:04:32.152
and I entered the world of whistling.

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:35.320
And I also entered the World Championship,

00:04:35.344 --> 00:04:37.976
and I won there, in 2004.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.912
(Applause)

00:04:41.936 --> 00:04:45.257
That was great fun, of course.

00:04:46.321 --> 00:04:51.817
And to defend my title --
like judokas do and sportsmen --

00:04:51.841 --> 00:04:54.182
I thought, well let's go back in 2005 --

00:04:54.206 --> 00:04:55.365
and I won again.

00:04:55.389 --> 00:04:56.825
(Laughter)

00:04:56.928 --> 00:04:59.025
Then I couldn't participate
for a few years.

00:04:59.049 --> 00:05:03.591
And in 2008, I entered again
in Japan, Tokyo, and I won again.

00:05:03.615 --> 00:05:05.976
So what happened now

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.816
is I'm standing here in Rotterdam,
in the beautiful city, on a big stage,

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:11.750
and I'm talking about whistling.

00:05:11.774 --> 00:05:15.253
And actually, I earn my money
whistling, at the moment.

00:05:15.277 --> 00:05:17.976
So I quit my day job as a nurse.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:22.976
(Applause)

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:24.976
And I try to live my dream --

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.145
well, actually, it was never my dream,
but it sounds so good.

00:05:28.169 --> 00:05:29.976
(Laughter)

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.293
OK, I'm not the only one whistling here.

00:05:32.317 --> 00:05:34.442
You say, "Huh, what do you mean?"

00:05:34.466 --> 00:05:37.024
Well actually, you are going
to whistle along.

00:05:40.476 --> 00:05:42.914
And then always the same thing happens:

00:05:42.938 --> 00:05:45.712
people are watching each other
and think, "Oh, my God.

00:05:45.736 --> 00:05:47.890
Why? Can I go away?"

00:05:47.914 --> 00:05:49.323
No, you can't.

00:05:49.347 --> 00:05:51.267
(Laughter)

00:05:51.846 --> 00:05:53.194
Actually, it's very simple.

00:05:53.218 --> 00:05:56.638
The track that I will whistle
is called "FÃªte de la Belle."

00:05:57.154 --> 00:05:58.971
It's about 80 minutes long.

00:05:58.995 --> 00:06:00.400
(Laughter)

00:06:00.424 --> 00:06:02.976
No, no, no. It's four minutes long.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.308
And I want to first rehearse
with you your whistling.

00:06:07.167 --> 00:06:08.919
Yes, so I whistle the tone.

00:06:08.943 --> 00:06:10.976
(Whistling)

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.216
(Laughter)

00:06:13.348 --> 00:06:15.362
Sorry, I forgot one thing --

00:06:16.163 --> 00:06:18.732
you whistle the same tone as me.

00:06:18.756 --> 00:06:20.605
(Laughter)

00:06:20.629 --> 00:06:26.559
I heard a wide variety of tones.

00:06:26.790 --> 00:06:31.847
(Geert Chatrou and audience whistling)

00:06:40.099 --> 00:06:41.305
(Whistling ends)

00:06:41.329 --> 00:06:42.688
This is very promising.

00:06:42.712 --> 00:06:43.899
(Laughter)

00:06:43.923 --> 00:06:45.264
This is very promising.

00:06:45.288 --> 00:06:47.976
I'll ask the technicians
to start the music.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.238
And if it's started,
I just point where you whistle along,

00:06:51.262 --> 00:06:52.835
and we will see what happens.

00:06:52.859 --> 00:06:54.994
(Laughter)

00:06:58.623 --> 00:07:02.646
Oh, I'm so sorry, technicians.

00:07:02.670 --> 00:07:06.899
(Laughter)

00:07:06.923 --> 00:07:08.121
I'm so used to that.

00:07:08.145 --> 00:07:09.169
(Laughter)

00:07:09.193 --> 00:07:10.518
I start it myself.

00:07:10.542 --> 00:07:11.703
(Laughter)

00:07:11.727 --> 00:07:12.976
OK, here it is.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:16.349
(Laughter)

00:07:16.373 --> 00:07:18.319
(Music)

00:07:18.343 --> 00:07:24.000
(Whistling)

00:07:29.108 --> 00:07:30.259
(Whistling ends)

00:07:30.283 --> 00:07:32.975
(Music)

00:07:34.322 --> 00:07:35.502
OK.

00:07:36.426 --> 00:07:41.666
(Whistling)

00:08:23.819 --> 00:08:25.571
It's easy, isn't it?

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:32.000
(Whistling)

00:09:00.349 --> 00:09:03.349
Now comes the solo,
I propose I do that myself, OK?

00:09:03.373 --> 00:09:05.976
(Music)

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:12.000
(Whistling)

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:25.253
(Applause)

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:33.729
Max Westerman: Geert Chatrou,
the World Champion of Whistling.

00:11:33.753 --> 00:11:35.928
Geert Chatrou: Thank you. Thank you.
