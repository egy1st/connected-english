00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
We're here to celebrate compassion.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
But compassion, from my vantage point,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
has a problem.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
As essential as it is across our traditions,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
as real as so many of us know it to be

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
in particular lives,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
the word "compassion" is hollowed out in our culture,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
and it is suspect in my field of journalism.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
It's seen as a squishy kumbaya thing,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
or it's seen as potentially depressing.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Karen Armstrong has told what I think is an iconic story

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
of giving a speech in Holland

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
and, after the fact, the word "compassion"

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
was translated as "pity."

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Now compassion, when it enters the news,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
too often comes in the form

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
of feel-good feature pieces

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
or sidebars about heroic people

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
you could never be like

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
or happy endings

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
or examples of self-sacrifice

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
that would seem to be too good to be true

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
most of the time.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
Our cultural imagination about compassion

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
has been deadened by idealistic images.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
And so what I'd like to do this morning

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
for the next few minutes

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
is perform a linguistic resurrection.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
And I hope you'll come with me on my basic premise

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
that words matter,

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
that they shape the way we understand ourselves,

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
the way we interpret the world

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
and the way we treat others.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
When this country

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
first encountered genuine diversity

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
in the 1960s,

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
we adopted tolerance

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
as the core civic virtue

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
with which we would approach that.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
Now the word "tolerance," if you look at it in the dictionary,

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
connotes "allowing," "indulging"

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
and "enduring."

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
In the medical context that it comes from,

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
it is about testing the limits of thriving

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
in an unfavorable environment.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
Tolerance is not really a lived virtue;

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000
it's more of a cerebral ascent.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
And it's too cerebral

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
to animate guts and hearts

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
and behavior

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
when the going gets rough.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
And the going is pretty rough right now.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
I think that without perhaps being able to name it,

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
we are collectively experiencing

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
that we've come as far as we can

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
with tolerance as our only guiding virtue.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
Compassion is a worthy successor.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
It is organic,

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000
across our religious, spiritual and ethical traditions,

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000
and yet it transcends them.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
Compassion is a piece of vocabulary

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
that could change us if we truly let it sink into

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
the standards to which we hold ourselves and others,

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000
both in our private and in our civic spaces.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
So what is it, three-dimensionally?

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
What are its kindred and component parts?

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
What's in its universe of attendant virtues?

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
To start simply,

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000
I want to say that compassion is kind.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.000
Now "kindness" might sound like a very mild word,

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.000
and it's prone to its own abundant cliche.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
But kindness is an everyday byproduct

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
of all the great virtues.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000
And it is a most edifying form

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000
of instant gratification.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
Compassion is also curious.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000
Compassion cultivates and practices curiosity.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
I love a phrase that was offered me

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
by two young women

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000
who are interfaith innovators in Los Angeles,

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000
Aziza Hasan and Malka Fenyvesi.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000
They are working to create a new imagination

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.000
about shared life among young Jews and Muslims,

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.000
and as they do that, they cultivate what they call

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
"curiosity without assumptions."

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.000
Well that's going to be a breeding ground for compassion.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000
Compassion can be synonymous with empathy.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.000
It can be joined with the harder work

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.000
of forgiveness and reconciliation,

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000
but it can also express itself

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.000
in the simple act of presence.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000
It's linked to practical virtues

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000
like generosity and hospitality

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000
and just being there,

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000
just showing up.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
I think that compassion

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000
also is often linked to beauty --

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000
and by that I mean a willingness

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000
to see beauty in the other,

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000
not just what it is about them

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000
that might need helping.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000
I love it that my Muslim conversation partners

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000
often speak of beauty as a core moral value.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.000
And in that light, for the religious,

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000
compassion also brings us

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000
into the territory of mystery --

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000
encouraging us not just

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000
to see beauty,

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000
but perhaps also to look for the face of God

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000
in the moment of suffering,

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000
in the face of a stranger,

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.000
in the face of the vibrant religious other.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000
I'm not sure if I can show you

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000
what tolerance looks like,

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000
but I can show you what compassion looks like --

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000
because it is visible.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000
When we see it, we recognize it

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000
and it changes the way we think about what is doable,

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000
what is possible.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000
It is so important

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000
when we're communicating big ideas --

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:03.000
but especially a big spiritual idea like compassion --

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000
to root it as we present it to others

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.000
in space and time and flesh and blood --

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.000
the color and complexity of life.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:16.000
And compassion does seek physicality.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000
I first started to learn this most vividly

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000
from Matthew Sanford.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000
And I don't imagine that you will realize this

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000
when you look at this photograph of him,

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000
but he's paraplegic.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.000
He's been paralyzed from the waist down since he was 13,

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.000
in a car crash that killed his father and his sister.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.000
Matthew's legs don't work, and he'll never walk again,

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000
and -- and he does experience this as an "and"

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000
rather than a "but" --

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000
and he experiences himself

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000
to be healed and whole.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000
And as a teacher of yoga,

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000
he brings that experience to others

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.000
across the spectrum of ability and disability,

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000
health, illness and aging.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.000
He says that he's just at an extreme end

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.000
of the spectrum we're all on.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.000
He's doing some amazing work now

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000
with veterans coming back from Iraq and Afghanistan.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.000
And Matthew has made this remarkable observation

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.000
that I'm just going to offer you and let it sit.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.000
I can't quite explain it, and he can't either.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.000
But he says that he has yet to experience someone

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.000
who became more aware of their body,

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.000
in all its frailty and its grace,

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.000
without, at the same time,

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.000
becoming more compassionate towards all of life.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.000
Compassion also looks like this.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.000
This is Jean Vanier.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000
Jean Vanier helped found the L'Arche communities,

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000
which you can now find all over the world,

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.000
communities centered around life

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.000
with people with mental disabilities --

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000
mostly Down syndrome.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000
The communities that Jean Vanier founded,

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.000
like Jean Vanier himself,

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.000
exude tenderness.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.000
"Tender" is another word

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.000
I would love to spend some time resurrecting.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000
We spend so much time in this culture

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.000
being driven and aggressive,

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.000
and I spend a lot of time being those things too.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.000
And compassion can also have those qualities.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.000
But again and again, lived compassion

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:08.000
brings us back to the wisdom of tenderness.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000
Jean Vanier says

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.000
that his work,

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000
like the work of other people --

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.000
his great, beloved, late friend Mother Teresa --

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.000
is never in the first instance about changing the world;

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:23.000
it's in the first instance about changing ourselves.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:26.000
He's says that what they do with L'Arche

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.000
is not a solution, but a sign.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:32.000
Compassion is rarely a solution,

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.000
but it is always a sign of a deeper reality,

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:37.000
of deeper human possibilities.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:40.000
And compassion is unleashed

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.000
in wider and wider circles

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.000
by signs and stories,

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.000
never by statistics and strategies.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.000
We need those things too,

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:53.000
but we're also bumping up against their limits.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:56.000
And at the same time that we are doing that,

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:59.000
I think we are rediscovering the power of story --

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.000
that as human beings, we need stories

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.000
to survive, to flourish,

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.000
to change.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.000
Our traditions have always known this,

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:10.000
and that is why they have always cultivated stories at their heart

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:13.000
and carried them forward in time for us.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:16.000
There is, of course, a story

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.000
behind the key moral longing

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.000
and commandment of Judaism

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:23.000
to repair the world -- tikkun olam.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.000
And I'll never forget hearing that story

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.000
from Dr. Rachel Naomi Remen,

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:30.000
who told it to me as her grandfather told it to her,

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000
that in the beginning of the Creation

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.000
something happened

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.000
and the original light of the universe

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.000
was shattered into countless pieces.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.000
It lodged as shards

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000
inside every aspect of the Creation.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.000
And that the highest human calling

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:48.000
is to look for this light, to point at it when we see it,

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000
to gather it up,

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:53.000
and in so doing, to repair the world.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:56.000
Now this might sound like a fanciful tale.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:59.000
Some of my fellow journalists might interpret it that way.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.000
Rachel Naomi Remen says

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.000
this is an important and empowering story

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.000
for our time,

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.000
because this story insists

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.000
that each and every one of us,

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.000
frail and flawed as we may be,

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.000
inadequate as we may feel,

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.000
has exactly what's needed

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:18.000
to help repair the part of the world

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:21.000
that we can see and touch.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:24.000
Stories like this,

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.000
signs like this,

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.000
are practical tools

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:32.000
in a world longing to bring compassion

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:35.000
to abundant images of suffering

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:38.000
that can otherwise overwhelm us.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.000
Rachel Naomi Remen

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.000
is actually bringing compassion

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:44.000
back to its rightful place alongside science

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.000
in her field of medicine

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:49.000
in the training of new doctors.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.000
And this trend

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.000
of what Rachel Naomi Remen is doing,

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.000
how these kinds of virtues

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.000
are finding a place in the vocabulary of medicine --

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.000
the work Fred Luskin is doing --

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.000
I think this is one of the most fascinating developments

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.000
of the 21st century --

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.000
that science, in fact,

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:08.000
is taking a virtue like compassion

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:11.000
definitively out of the realm of idealism.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:14.000
This is going to change science, I believe,

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.000
and it will change religion.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.000
But here's a face

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.000
from 20th century science

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.000
that might surprise you

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.000
in a discussion about compassion.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:27.000
We all know about the Albert Einstein

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:30.000
who came up with E = mc2.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:33.000
We don't hear so much about the Einstein

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:36.000
who invited the African American opera singer, Marian Anderson,

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:39.000
to stay in his home when she came to sing in Princeton

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.000
because the best hotel there

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.000
was segregated and wouldn't have her.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:46.000
We don't hear about the Einstein who used his celebrity

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:49.000
to advocate for political prisoners in Europe

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.000
or the Scottsboro boys

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:53.000
in the American South.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:56.000
Einstein believed deeply

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.000
that science should transcend

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.000
national and ethnic divisions.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:03.000
But he watched physicists and chemists

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:06.000
become the purveyors of weapons of mass destruction

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.000
in the early 20th century.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:11.000
He once said that science in his generation

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.000
had become like a razor blade

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.000
in the hands of a three-year-old.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.000
And Einstein foresaw

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.000
that as we grow more modern

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.000
and technologically advanced,

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.000
we need the virtues

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:26.000
our traditions carry forward in time

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.000
more, not less.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:32.000
He liked to talk about the spiritual geniuses of the ages.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.000
Some of his favorites were Moses,

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:37.000
Jesus, Buddha, St. Francis of Assisi,

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:40.000
Gandhi -- he adored his contemporary, Gandhi.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:42.000
And Einstein said --

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:44.000
and I think this is a quote,

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:46.000
again, that has not been passed down in his legacy --

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.000
that "these kinds of people

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.000
are geniuses in the art of living,

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.000
more necessary

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:55.000
to the dignity, security and joy of humanity

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:58.000
than the discoverers of objective knowledge."

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.000
Now invoking Einstein

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:05.000
might not seem the best way to bring compassion down to earth

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:07.000
and make it seem accessible to all the rest of us,

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:10.000
but actually it is.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.000
I want to show you

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:15.000
the rest of this photograph,

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:17.000
because this photograph

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:20.000
is analogous to what we do to the word "compassion" in our culture --

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.000
we clean it up

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:25.000
and we diminish its depths and its grounding

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.000
in life, which is messy.

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:29.000
So in this photograph

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:31.000
you see a mind looking out a window

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:33.000
at what might be a cathedral -- it's not.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:35.000
This is the full photograph,

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:37.000
and you see a middle-aged man wearing a leather jacket,

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.000
smoking a cigar.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:41.000
And by the look of that paunch,

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.000
he hasn't been doing enough yoga.

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:46.000
We put these two photographs side-by-side on our website,

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.000
and someone said, "When I look at the first photo,

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.000
I ask myself, what was he thinking?

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:52.000
And when I look at the second, I ask,

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:55.000
what kind of person was he? What kind of man is this?"

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.000
Well, he was complicated.

00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:59.000
He was incredibly compassionate

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.000
in some of his relationships

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:04.000
and terribly inadequate in others.

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:07.000
And it is much harder, often,

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:11.000
to be compassionate towards those closest to us,

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:14.000
which is another quality in the universe of compassion,

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.000
on its dark side,

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:19.000
that also deserves our serious attention and illumination.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:24.000
Gandhi, too, was a real flawed human being.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:27.000
So was Martin Luther King, Jr. So was Dorothy Day.

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:29.000
So was Mother Teresa.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:31.000
So are we all.

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.000
And I want to say

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:35.000
that it is a liberating thing

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:37.000
to realize that that is no obstacle to compassion --

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:40.000
following on what Fred Luskin says --

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:43.000
that these flaws just make us human.

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:46.000
Our culture is obsessed with perfection

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.000
and with hiding problems.

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.000
But what a liberating thing to realize

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.000
that our problems, in fact,

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:55.000
are probably our richest sources

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:59.000
for rising to this ultimate virtue of compassion,

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:01.000
towards bringing compassion

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:04.000
towards the suffering and joys of others.

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:08.000
Rachel Naomi Remen is a better doctor

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:10.000
because of her life-long struggle with Crohn's disease.

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:12.000
Einstein became a humanitarian,

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:14.000
not because of his exquisite knowledge

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.000
of space and time and matter,

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:19.000
but because he was a Jew as Germany grew fascist.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:22.000
And Karen Armstrong, I think you would also say

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:25.000
that it was some of your very wounding experiences

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:27.000
in a religious life that,

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:29.000
with a zigzag,

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:32.000
have led to the Charter for Compassion.

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:36.000
Compassion can't be reduced to sainthood

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:39.000
any more than it can be reduced to pity.

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.000
So I want to propose

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:45.000
a final definition of compassion --

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:48.000
this is Einstein with Paul Robeson by the way --

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:50.000
and that would be for us

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:53.000
to call compassion a spiritual technology.

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:56.000
Now our traditions contain

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:58.000
vast wisdom about this,

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:01.000
and we need them to mine it for us now.

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:04.000
But compassion is also equally at home

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:07.000
in the secular as in the religious.

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:10.000
So I will paraphrase Einstein in closing

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:12.000
and say that humanity,

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:14.000
the future of humanity,

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:16.000
needs this technology

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:18.000
as much as it needs all the others

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:21.000
that have now connected us

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:23.000
and set before us

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:25.000
the terrifying and wondrous possibility

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:28.000
of actually becoming one human race.

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:30.000
Thank you.

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:32.000
(Applause)
