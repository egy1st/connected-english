00:00:01.024 --> 00:00:03.707
I want you to take a look at this baby.

00:00:04.179 --> 00:00:08.975
What you're drawn to are her eyes
and the skin you love to touch.

00:00:09.386 --> 00:00:12.526
But today I'm going to talk to you
about something you can't see.

00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:15.302
What's going on
up in that little brain of hers.

00:00:16.135 --> 00:00:20.056
The modern tools of neuroscience
are demonstrating to us

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:23.975
that what's going on up there
is nothing short of rocket science.

00:00:24.736 --> 00:00:28.173
And what we're learning
is going to shed some light

00:00:28.197 --> 00:00:34.095
on what the romantic writers and poets
described as the "celestial openness"

00:00:34.119 --> 00:00:35.976
of the child's mind.

00:00:37.013 --> 00:00:40.471
What we see here is a mother in India,

00:00:40.495 --> 00:00:44.399
and she's speaking Koro,
which is a newly discovered language.

00:00:44.797 --> 00:00:46.604
And she's talking to her baby.

00:00:47.089 --> 00:00:48.245
What this mother --

00:00:48.269 --> 00:00:51.488
and the 800 people who speak
Koro in the world --

00:00:51.512 --> 00:00:54.722
understands is that,
to preserve this language,

00:00:54.746 --> 00:00:57.332
they need to speak it to the babies.

00:00:57.356 --> 00:01:00.231
And therein lies a critical puzzle.

00:01:00.255 --> 00:01:02.505
Why is it that you can't
preserve a language

00:01:02.529 --> 00:01:05.764
by speaking to you and I, to the adults?

00:01:05.788 --> 00:01:07.976
Well, it's got to do with your brain.

00:01:08.538 --> 00:01:12.976
What we see here is that language
has a critical period for learning.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.800
The way to read this slide is to look
at your age on the horizontal axis.

00:01:16.824 --> 00:01:19.507
(Laughter)

00:01:19.531 --> 00:01:23.170
And you'll see on the vertical
your skill at acquiring a second language.

00:01:23.789 --> 00:01:27.648
The babies and children are geniuses
until they turn seven,

00:01:27.672 --> 00:01:29.976
and then there's a systematic decline.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.497
After puberty, we fall off the map.

00:01:32.934 --> 00:01:35.466
No scientists dispute this curve,

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.445
but laboratories all over the world

00:01:37.469 --> 00:01:39.976
are trying to figure out
why it works this way.

00:01:40.518 --> 00:01:44.552
Work in my lab is focused on the first
critical period in development,

00:01:44.576 --> 00:01:46.421
and that is the period in which babies

00:01:46.445 --> 00:01:49.810
try to master which sounds
are used in their language.

00:01:49.834 --> 00:01:52.324
We think, by studying
how the sounds are learned,

00:01:52.348 --> 00:01:54.613
we'll have a model
for the rest of language,

00:01:54.637 --> 00:01:57.575
and perhaps for critical periods
that may exist in childhood

00:01:57.599 --> 00:02:00.462
for social, emotional
and cognitive development.

00:02:01.035 --> 00:02:02.976
So we've been studying the babies

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.503
using a technique
that we're using all over the world

00:02:05.527 --> 00:02:07.383
and the sounds of all languages.

00:02:07.407 --> 00:02:09.198
The baby sits on a parent's lap,

00:02:09.222 --> 00:02:12.143
and we train them to turn
their heads when a sound changes --

00:02:12.167 --> 00:02:13.625
like from "ah" to "ee."

00:02:13.649 --> 00:02:17.082
If they do so at the appropriate time,
the black box lights up

00:02:17.106 --> 00:02:19.090
and a panda bear pounds a drum.

00:02:19.114 --> 00:02:21.532
A six-monther adores the task.

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:23.321
What have we learned?

00:02:23.345 --> 00:02:25.505
Well, babies all over the world

00:02:25.529 --> 00:02:29.187
are what I like to describe
as "citizens of the world."

00:02:29.646 --> 00:02:32.574
They can discriminate
all the sounds of all languages,

00:02:32.598 --> 00:02:35.830
no matter what country we're testing
and what language we're using,

00:02:35.854 --> 00:02:38.849
and that's remarkable
because you and I can't do that.

00:02:38.873 --> 00:02:40.844
We're culture-bound listeners.

00:02:40.868 --> 00:02:43.263
We can discriminate the sounds
of our own language,

00:02:43.287 --> 00:02:45.134
but not those of foreign languages.

00:02:45.158 --> 00:02:48.325
So the question arises:
When do those citizens of the world

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:51.233
turn into the language-bound
listeners that we are?

00:02:51.257 --> 00:02:54.394
And the answer:
before their first birthdays.

00:02:54.418 --> 00:02:57.550
What you see here is performance
on that head-turn task

00:02:57.574 --> 00:03:00.037
for babies tested in Tokyo
and the United States,

00:03:00.061 --> 00:03:01.499
here in Seattle,

00:03:01.523 --> 00:03:03.272
as they listened to "ra" and "la" --

00:03:03.296 --> 00:03:06.102
sounds important to English,
but not to Japanese.

00:03:06.126 --> 00:03:09.504
So at six to eight months,
the babies are totally equivalent.

00:03:09.528 --> 00:03:12.082
Two months later,
something incredible occurs.

00:03:12.106 --> 00:03:14.786
The babies in the United States
are getting a lot better,

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:16.734
babies in Japan are getting a lot worse,

00:03:16.758 --> 00:03:20.208
but both of those groups of babies
are preparing for exactly the language

00:03:20.232 --> 00:03:21.724
that they are going to learn.

00:03:21.748 --> 00:03:26.372
So the question is: What's happening
during this critical two-month period?

00:03:26.396 --> 00:03:28.739
This is the critical period
for sound development,

00:03:28.763 --> 00:03:30.178
but what's going on up there?

00:03:30.202 --> 00:03:32.181
So there are two things going on.

00:03:32.205 --> 00:03:35.081
The first is that the babies
are listening intently to us,

00:03:35.105 --> 00:03:38.838
and they're taking statistics
as they listen to us talk --

00:03:38.862 --> 00:03:40.843
they're taking statistics.

00:03:40.867 --> 00:03:43.406
So listen to two mothers
speaking motherese --

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:46.472
the universal language
we use when we talk to kids --

00:03:46.496 --> 00:03:48.707
first in English and then in Japanese.

00:03:48.731 --> 00:03:52.170
(Video) Ah, I love your big blue eyes --

00:03:52.194 --> 00:03:55.000
so pretty and nice.

00:03:56.049 --> 00:04:01.976
(Japanese)

00:04:02.452 --> 00:04:05.819
Patricia Kuhl: During the production
of speech, when babies listen,

00:04:05.843 --> 00:04:10.612
what they're doing is taking statistics
on the language that they hear.

00:04:11.353 --> 00:04:14.263
And those distributions grow.

00:04:14.287 --> 00:04:18.660
And what we've learned is that babies
are sensitive to the statistics,

00:04:18.684 --> 00:04:22.512
and the statistics of Japanese
and English are very, very different.

00:04:22.536 --> 00:04:25.193
English has a lot of Rs and Ls.

00:04:25.217 --> 00:04:26.976
The distribution shows.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.840
And the distribution of Japanese
is totally different,

00:04:29.864 --> 00:04:32.865
where we see a group
of intermediate sounds,

00:04:32.889 --> 00:04:35.304
which is known as the Japanese "R."

00:04:35.328 --> 00:04:39.436
So babies absorb
the statistics of the language

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:41.138
and it changes their brains;

00:04:41.162 --> 00:04:43.313
it changes them
from the citizens of the world

00:04:43.337 --> 00:04:46.283
to the culture-bound
listeners that we are.

00:04:46.307 --> 00:04:51.020
But we as adults are no longer
absorbing those statistics.

00:04:51.044 --> 00:04:53.601
We are governed
by the representations in memory

00:04:53.625 --> 00:04:56.174
that were formed early in development.

00:04:56.198 --> 00:04:57.976
So what we're seeing here

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.233
is changing our models
of what the critical period is about.

00:05:01.257 --> 00:05:04.026
We're arguing from
a mathematical standpoint

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:07.190
that the learning of language
material may slow down

00:05:07.214 --> 00:05:09.594
when our distributions stabilize.

00:05:09.618 --> 00:05:12.480
It's raising lots of questions
about bilingual people.

00:05:12.918 --> 00:05:16.949
Bilinguals must keep two sets
of statistics in mind at once

00:05:16.973 --> 00:05:19.856
and flip between them,
one after the other,

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:21.652
depending on who they're speaking to.

00:05:21.676 --> 00:05:22.830
So we asked ourselves,

00:05:22.854 --> 00:05:26.261
can the babies take statistics
on a brand new language?

00:05:26.285 --> 00:05:29.563
And we tested this
by exposing American babies

00:05:29.587 --> 00:05:31.276
who'd never heard a second language

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:34.016
to Mandarin for the first time
during the critical period.

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:37.577
We knew that, when monolinguals
were tested in Taipei and Seattle

00:05:37.601 --> 00:05:40.263
on the Mandarin sounds,
they showed the same pattern.

00:05:40.287 --> 00:05:42.758
Six to eight months,
they're totally equivalent.

00:05:42.782 --> 00:05:45.318
Two months later,
something incredible happens.

00:05:45.342 --> 00:05:48.894
But the Taiwanese babies are getting
better, not the American babies.

00:05:48.918 --> 00:05:53.800
What we did was expose American babies,
during this period, to Mandarin.

00:05:53.824 --> 00:05:56.832
It was like having Mandarin relatives
come and visit for a month

00:05:56.856 --> 00:06:00.653
and move into your house
and talk to the babies for 12 sessions.

00:06:00.677 --> 00:06:02.883
Here's what it looked like
in the laboratory.

00:06:02.907 --> 00:06:08.463
(Mandarin)

00:06:24.662 --> 00:06:26.908
PK: So what have we done
to their little brains?

00:06:26.932 --> 00:06:28.976
(Laughter)

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.671
We had to run a control group to make sure

00:06:31.695 --> 00:06:34.907
that coming into the laboratory
didn't improve your Mandarin skills.

00:06:34.931 --> 00:06:37.584
So a group of babies came in
and listened to English.

00:06:37.608 --> 00:06:39.010
And we can see from the graph

00:06:39.034 --> 00:06:41.617
that exposure to English
didn't improve their Mandarin.

00:06:41.641 --> 00:06:45.236
But look at what happened to the babies
exposed to Mandarin for 12 sessions.

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:47.660
They were as good as the babies in Taiwan

00:06:47.684 --> 00:06:50.660
who'd been listening
for 10 and a half months.

00:06:50.684 --> 00:06:54.508
What it demonstrated is that babies
take statistics on a new language.

00:06:54.532 --> 00:06:57.976
Whatever you put in front of them,
they'll take statistics on.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:06:59.590
But we wondered what role

00:06:59.614 --> 00:07:03.851
the human being played
in this learning exercise.

00:07:04.168 --> 00:07:08.484
So we ran another group of babies
in which the kids got the same dosage,

00:07:08.508 --> 00:07:10.976
the same 12 sessions,
but over a television set.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.661
And another group of babies
who had just audio exposure

00:07:14.685 --> 00:07:16.773
and looked at a teddy bear on the screen.

00:07:16.797 --> 00:07:18.976
What did we do to their brains?

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:22.375
What you see here is the audio result --

00:07:22.923 --> 00:07:24.661
no learning whatsoever --

00:07:24.685 --> 00:07:26.443
and the video result --

00:07:27.236 --> 00:07:29.081
no learning whatsoever.

00:07:29.105 --> 00:07:33.246
It takes a human being
for babies to take their statistics.

00:07:33.622 --> 00:07:35.788
The social brain is controlling

00:07:35.812 --> 00:07:37.917
when the babies
are taking their statistics.

00:07:37.941 --> 00:07:41.434
We want to get inside the brain
and see this thing happening

00:07:41.458 --> 00:07:45.396
as babies are in front of televisions,
as opposed to in front of human beings.

00:07:45.420 --> 00:07:50.117
Thankfully, we have a new machine,
magnetoencephalography,

00:07:50.141 --> 00:07:51.434
that allows us to do this.

00:07:51.458 --> 00:07:54.043
It looks like a hair dryer from Mars.

00:07:54.067 --> 00:07:58.550
But it's completely safe,
completely noninvasive and silent.

00:07:58.574 --> 00:08:01.017
We're looking at millimeter accuracy

00:08:01.041 --> 00:08:04.357
with regard to spatial
and millisecond accuracy

00:08:04.381 --> 00:08:07.003
using 306 SQUIDs --

00:08:07.027 --> 00:08:10.127
these are superconducting
quantum interference devices --

00:08:10.151 --> 00:08:13.782
to pick up the magnetic fields
that change as we do our thinking.

00:08:14.249 --> 00:08:19.858
We're the first in the world
to record babies in an MEG machine

00:08:19.882 --> 00:08:22.273
while they are learning.

00:08:22.297 --> 00:08:23.976
So this is little Emma.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:25.908
She's a six-monther.

00:08:25.932 --> 00:08:31.050
And she's listening to various languages
in the earphones that are in her ears.

00:08:31.074 --> 00:08:33.298
You can see, she can move around.

00:08:33.322 --> 00:08:37.092
We're tracking her head
with little pellets in a cap,

00:08:37.116 --> 00:08:40.091
so she's free to move
completely unconstrained.

00:08:40.115 --> 00:08:42.328
It's a technical tour de force.

00:08:42.352 --> 00:08:43.936
What are we seeing?

00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:45.854
We're seeing the baby brain.

00:08:45.878 --> 00:08:51.164
As the baby hears a word in her language,
the auditory areas light up,

00:08:51.188 --> 00:08:55.976
and then subsequently areas surrounding it
that we think are related to coherence,

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:59.976
getting the brain coordinated
with its different areas, and causality,

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.976
one brain area
causing another to activate.

00:09:03.601 --> 00:09:08.985
We are embarking on a grand
and golden age of knowledge

00:09:09.009 --> 00:09:11.245
about child's brain development.

00:09:11.269 --> 00:09:13.690
We're going to be able
to see a child's brain

00:09:13.714 --> 00:09:17.955
as they experience an emotion,
as they learn to speak and read,

00:09:17.979 --> 00:09:21.181
as they solve a math problem,
as they have an idea.

00:09:21.515 --> 00:09:24.864
And we're going to be able to invent
brain-based interventions

00:09:24.888 --> 00:09:27.158
for children who have difficulty learning.

00:09:27.571 --> 00:09:30.637
Just as the poets and writers described,

00:09:30.661 --> 00:09:34.815
we're going to be able to see, I think,
that wondrous openness,

00:09:34.839 --> 00:09:38.263
utter and complete openness,
of the mind of a child.

00:09:39.024 --> 00:09:41.700
In investigating the child's brain,

00:09:41.724 --> 00:09:45.720
we're going to uncover deep truths
about what it means to be human,

00:09:45.744 --> 00:09:46.899
and in the process,

00:09:46.923 --> 00:09:49.994
we may be able to help keep
our own minds open to learning

00:09:50.018 --> 00:09:51.709
for our entire lives.

00:09:51.733 --> 00:09:52.976
Thank you.

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:56.000
(Applause)
