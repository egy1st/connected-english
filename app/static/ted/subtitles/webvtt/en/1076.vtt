00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
I've been spending a lot of time

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
traveling around the world these days,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
talking to groups of students and professionals,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
and everywhere I'm finding that I hear similar themes.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
On the one hand, people say,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
"The time for change is now."

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
They want to be part of it.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
They talk about wanting lives of purpose and greater meaning.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
But on the other hand,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
I hear people talking about fear,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
a sense of risk-aversion.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
They say, "I really want to follow a life of purpose,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
but I don't know where to start.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
I don't want to disappoint my family or friends."

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
I work in global poverty.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
And they say, "I want to work in global poverty,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
but what will it mean about my career?

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Will I be marginalized?

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Will I not make enough money?

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
Will I never get married or have children?"

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
And as a woman who didn't get married until I was a lot older --

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
and I'm glad I waited --

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
(Laughter)

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
-- and has no children,

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
I look at these young people

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
and I say, "Your job is not to be perfect.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
Your job is only to be human.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
And nothing important happens in life

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
without a cost."

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
These conversations really reflect what's happening

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
at the national and international level.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
Our leaders and ourselves

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
want everything,

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
but we don't talk about the costs.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
We don't talk about the sacrifice.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
One of my favorite quotes from literature

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
was written by Tillie Olsen,

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
the great American writer from the South.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
In a short story called "Oh Yes,"

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
she talks about a white woman in the 1950s

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
who has a daughter

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
who befriends a little African American girl,

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
and she looks at her child with a sense of pride,

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
but she also wonders,

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
what price will she pay?

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
"Better immersion

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
than to live untouched."

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
But the real question is,

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
what is the cost of not daring?

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000
What is the cost of not trying?

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
I've been so privileged in my life

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
to know extraordinary leaders

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000
who have chosen to live lives of immersion.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
One woman I knew who was a fellow

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
at a program that I ran at the Rockefeller Foundation

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
was named Ingrid Washinawatok.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000
She was a leader of the Menominee tribe,

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
a Native American peoples.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
And when we would gather as fellows,

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
she would push us to think about

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
how the elders in Native American culture

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
make decisions.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
And she said they would literally visualize

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
the faces of children

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
for seven generations into the future,

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
looking at them from the Earth,

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
and they would look at them, holding them as stewards

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
for that future.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
Ingrid understood that we are connected to each other,

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
not only as human beings,

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000
but to every living thing on the planet.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
And tragically, in 1999,

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
when she was in Colombia

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
working with the U'wa people,

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000
focused on preserving their culture and language,

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
she and two colleagues were abducted

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.000
and tortured and killed by the FARC.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000
And whenever we would gather the fellows after that,

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000
we would leave a chair empty for her spirit.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000
And more than a decade later,

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
when I talk to NGO fellows,

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
whether in Trenton, New Jersey or the office of the White House,

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000
and we talk about Ingrid,

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
they all say that they're trying to integrate her wisdom

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
and her spirit

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000
and really build on the unfulfilled work

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
of her life's mission.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000
And when we think about legacy,

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000
I can think of no more powerful one,

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.000
despite how short her life was.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
And I've been touched by Cambodian women --

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000
beautiful women,

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000
women who held the tradition of the classical dance in Cambodia.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000
And I met them in the early '90s.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000
In the 1970s, under the Pol Pot regime,

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.000
the Khmer Rouge killed over a million people,

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000
and they focused and targeted the elites and the intellectuals,

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000
the artists, the dancers.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000
And at the end of the war,

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000
there were only 30 of these classical dancers still living.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
And the women, who I was so privileged to meet

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
when there were three survivors,

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
told these stories about lying in their cots

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000
in the refugee camps.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000
They said they would try so hard

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.000
to remember the fragments of the dance,

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.000
hoping that others were alive and doing the same.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.000
And one woman stood there with this perfect carriage,

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000
her hands at her side,

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000
and she talked about

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000
the reunion of the 30 after the war

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000
and how extraordinary it was.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000
And these big tears fell down her face,

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000
but she never lifted her hands to move them.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000
And the women decided that they would train

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000
not the next generation of girls, because they had grown too old already,

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000
but the next generation.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000
And I sat there in the studio

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000
watching these women clapping their hands --

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000
beautiful rhythms --

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000
as these little fairy pixies

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000
were dancing around them,

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000
wearing these beautiful silk colors.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.000
And I thought, after all this atrocity,

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.000
this is how human beings really pray.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.000
Because they're focused on honoring

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.000
what is most beautiful about our past

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000
and building it into

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000
the promise of our future.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000
And what these women understood

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000
is sometimes the most important things that we do

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000
and that we spend our time on

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.000
are those things that we cannot measure.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000
I also have been touched

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000
by the dark side of power and leadership.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000
And I have learned that power,

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000
particularly in its absolute form,

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.000
is an equal opportunity provider.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000
In 1986, I moved to Rwanda,

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000
and I worked with a very small group of Rwandan women

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000
to start that country's first microfinance bank.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.000
And one of the women was Agnes --

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000
there on your extreme left --

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000
she was one of the first three

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000
women parliamentarians in Rwanda,

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000
and her legacy should have been

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.000
to be one of the mothers of Rwanda.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.000
We built this institution based on social justice,

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000
gender equity,

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.000
this idea of empowering women.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.000
But Agnes cared more about the trappings of power

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.000
than she did principle at the end.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.000
And though she had been part of building a liberal party,

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.000
a political party

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.000
that was focused on diversity and tolerance,

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.000
about three months before the genocide, she switched parties

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.000
and joined the extremist party, Hutu Power,

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000
and she became the Minister of Justice

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.000
under the genocide regime

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.000
and was known for inciting men to kill faster

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.000
and stop behaving like women.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.000
She was convicted

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.000
of category one crimes of genocide.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.000
And I would visit her in the prisons,

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.000
sitting side-by-side, knees touching,

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000
and I would have to admit to myself

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.000
that monsters exist in all of us,

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000
but that maybe it's not monsters so much,

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.000
but the broken parts of ourselves,

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.000
sadnesses, secret shame,

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.000
and that ultimately it's easy for demagogues

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.000
to prey on those parts,

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.000
those fragments, if you will,

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:55.000
and to make us look at other beings, human beings,

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.000
as lesser than ourselves --

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:01.000
and in the extreme, to do terrible things.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.000
And there is no group

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.000
more vulnerable to those kinds of manipulations

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.000
than young men.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:11.000
I've heard it said that the most dangerous animal on the planet

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.000
is the adolescent male.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000
And so in a gathering

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.000
where we're focused on women,

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.000
while it is so critical that we invest in our girls

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.000
and we even the playing field

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:25.000
and we find ways to honor them,

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:28.000
we have to remember that the girls and the women

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000
are most isolated and violated

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000
and victimized and made invisible

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.000
in those very societies

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000
where our men and our boys

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.000
feel disempowered,

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.000
unable to provide.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.000
And that, when they sit on those street corners

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.000
and all they can think of in the future

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.000
is no job, no education,

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.000
no possibility,

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.000
well then it's easy to understand

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.000
how the greatest source of status

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.000
can come from a uniform

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.000
and a gun.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.000
Sometimes very small investments

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.000
can release enormous, infinite potential

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.000
that exists in all of us.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.000
One of the Acumen Fund fellows at my organization,

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.000
Suraj Sudhakar,

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:10.000
has what we call moral imagination --

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000
the ability to put yourself in another person's shoes

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.000
and lead from that perspective.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:18.000
And he's been working with this young group of men

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:21.000
who come from the largest slum in the world, Kibera.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.000
And they're incredible guys.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.000
And together they started a book club

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.000
for a hundred people in the slums,

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:30.000
and they're reading many TED authors and liking it.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.000
And then they created a business plan competition.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.000
Then they decided that they would do TEDx's.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.000
And I have learned so much

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.000
from Chris and Kevin

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000
and Alex and Herbert

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.000
and all of these young men.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000
Alex, in some ways, said it best.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.000
He said, "We used to feel like nobodies,

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000
but now we feel like somebodies."

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.000
And I think we have it all wrong

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.000
when we think that income is the link.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.000
What we really yearn for as human beings

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:59.000
is to be visible to each other.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.000
And the reason these young guys

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.000
told me that they're doing these TEDx's

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.000
is because they were sick and tired

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:08.000
of the only workshops coming to the slums

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:11.000
being those workshops focused on HIV,

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.000
or at best, microfinance.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.000
And they wanted to celebrate

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:18.000
what's beautiful about Kibera and Mathare --

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.000
the photojournalists and the creatives,

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:23.000
the graffiti artists, the teachers and the entrepreneurs.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.000
And they're doing it.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:28.000
And my hat's off to you in Kibera.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.000
My own work focuses

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:33.000
on making philanthropy more effective

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:36.000
and capitalism more inclusive.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.000
At Acumen Fund, we take philanthropic resources

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.000
and we invest what we call patient capital --

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:44.000
money that will invest in entrepreneurs who see the poor

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.000
not as passive recipients of charity,

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.000
but as full-bodied agents of change

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.000
who want to solve their own problems

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.000
and make their own decisions.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.000
We leave our money for 10 to 15 years,

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.000
and when we get it back, we invest in other innovations

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.000
that focus on change.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.000
I know it works.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.000
We've invested more than 50 million dollars in 50 companies,

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:06.000
and those companies have brought another 200 million dollars

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.000
into these forgotten markets.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:11.000
This year alone, they've delivered 40 million services

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.000
like maternal health care and housing,

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:16.000
emergency services, solar energy,

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.000
so that people can have more dignity

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.000
in solving their problems.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.000
Patient capital is uncomfortable

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.000
for people searching for simple solutions,

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.000
easy categories,

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:30.000
because we don't see profit as a blunt instrument.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.000
But we find those entrepreneurs

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.000
who put people and the planet

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.000
before profit.

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:39.000
And ultimately, we want to be part of a movement

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.000
that is about measuring impact,

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:44.000
measuring what is most important to us.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:47.000
And my dream is we'll have a world one day

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.000
where we don't just honor those who take money

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.000
and make more money from it,

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:54.000
but we find those individuals who take our resources

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.000
and convert it into changing the world

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.000
in the most positive ways.

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.000
And it's only when we honor them

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.000
and celebrate them and give them status

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:05.000
that the world will really change.

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:08.000
Last May I had this extraordinary 24-hour period

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.000
where I saw two visions of the world

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.000
living side-by-side --

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.000
one based on violence

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.000
and the other on transcendence.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.000
I happened to be in Lahore, Pakistan

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.000
on the day that two mosques were attacked

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.000
by suicide bombers.

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.000
And the reason these mosques were attacked

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.000
is because the people praying inside

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.000
were from a particular sect of Islam

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:31.000
who fundamentalists don't believe are fully Muslim.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:33.000
And not only did those suicide bombers

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.000
take a hundred lives,

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:37.000
but they did more,

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:40.000
because they created more hatred, more rage, more fear

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:43.000
and certainly despair.

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.000
But less than 24 hours,

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:48.000
I was 13 miles away from those mosques,

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.000
visiting one of our Acumen investees,

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.000
an incredible man, Jawad Aslam,

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:55.000
who dares to live a life of immersion.

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:57.000
Born and raised in Baltimore,

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:00.000
he studied real estate, worked in commercial real estate,

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:03.000
and after 9/11 decided he was going to Pakistan to make a difference.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:06.000
For two years, he hardly made any money, a tiny stipend,

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:09.000
but he apprenticed with this incredible housing developer

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:12.000
named Tasneem Saddiqui.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.000
And he had a dream that he would build a housing community

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.000
on this barren piece of land

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.000
using patient capital,

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.000
but he continued to pay a price.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.000
He stood on moral ground

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:24.000
and refused to pay bribes.

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:27.000
It took almost two years just to register the land.

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:30.000
But I saw how the level of moral standard can rise

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:33.000
from one person's action.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:36.000
Today, 2,000 people live in 300 houses

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.000
in this beautiful community.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:41.000
And there's schools and clinics and shops.

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.000
But there's only one mosque.

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:45.000
And so I asked Jawad,

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:48.000
"How do you guys navigate? This is a really diverse community.

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.000
Who gets to use the mosque on Fridays?"

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:52.000
He said, "Long story.

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:55.000
It was hard, it was a difficult road,

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:58.000
but ultimately the leaders of the community came together,

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:01.000
realizing we only have each other.

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:03.000
And we decided that we would elect

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:05.000
the three most respected imams,

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:07.000
and those imams would take turns,

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:09.000
they would rotate who would say Friday prayer.

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:11.000
But the whole community,

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:14.000
all the different sects, including Shi'a and Sunni,

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:17.000
would sit together and pray."

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:19.000
We need that kind of moral leadership and courage

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:21.000
in our worlds.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:24.000
We face huge issues as a world --

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.000
the financial crisis,

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:28.000
global warming

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:31.000
and this growing sense of fear and otherness.

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:34.000
And every day we have a choice.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:36.000
We can take the easier road,

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.000
the more cynical road,

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.000
which is a road based on

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:43.000
sometimes dreams of a past that never really was,

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:46.000
a fear of each other,

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.000
distancing and blame.

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:51.000
Or we can take the much more difficult path

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:53.000
of transformation, transcendence,

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.000
compassion and love,

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:58.000
but also accountability and justice.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:01.000
I had the great honor

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:04.000
of working with the child psychologist Dr. Robert Coles,

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:06.000
who stood up for change

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:09.000
during the Civil Rights movement in the United States.

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:11.000
And he tells this incredible story

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:14.000
about working with a little six-year-old girl named Ruby Bridges,

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:17.000
the first child to desegregate schools in the South --

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:19.000
in this case, New Orleans.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:21.000
And he said that every day

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:23.000
this six-year-old, dressed in her beautiful dress,

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:25.000
would walk with real grace

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:28.000
through a phalanx of white people

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.000
screaming angrily, calling her a monster,

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.000
threatening to poison her --

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.000
distorted faces.

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:36.000
And every day he would watch her,

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:38.000
and it looked like she was talking to the people.

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:40.000
And he would say, "Ruby, what are you saying?"

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.000
And she'd say, "I'm not talking."

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:44.000
And finally he said, "Ruby, I see that you're talking.

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.000
What are you saying?"

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.000
And she said, "Dr. Coles, I am not talking;

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:50.000
I'm praying."

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:53.000
And he said, "Well, what are you praying?"

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:55.000
And she said, "I'm praying, 'Father, forgive them,

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:58.000
for they know not what they are doing.'"

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:00.000
At age six,

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:03.000
this child was living a life of immersion,

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:05.000
and her family paid a price for it.

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:07.000
But she became part of history

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:09.000
and opened up this idea

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:12.000
that all of us should have access to education.

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:16.000
My final story is about a young, beautiful man

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:18.000
named Josephat Byaruhanga,

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.000
who was another Acumen Fund fellow,

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:23.000
who hails from Uganda, a farming community.

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:26.000
And we placed him in a company in Western Kenya,

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:28.000
just 200 miles away.

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:31.000
And he said to me at the end of his year,

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:33.000
"Jacqueline, it was so humbling,

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:36.000
because I thought as a farmer and as an African

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:38.000
I would understand how to transcend culture.

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:41.000
But especially when I was talking to the African women,

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:43.000
I sometimes made these mistakes --

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:45.000
it was so hard for me to learn how to listen."

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:47.000
And he said, "So I conclude that, in many ways,

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:50.000
leadership is like a panicle of rice.

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:52.000
Because at the height of the season,

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:54.000
at the height of its powers,

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:57.000
it's beautiful, it's green, it nourishes the world,

00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:59.000
it reaches to the heavens."

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:02.000
And he said, "But right before the harvest,

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:04.000
it bends over

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:06.000
with great gratitude and humility

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:09.000
to touch the earth from where it came."

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:12.000
We need leaders.

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:15.000
We ourselves need to lead

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:17.000
from a place that has the audacity

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:19.000
to believe we can, ourselves,

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:21.000
extend the fundamental assumption

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:24.000
that all men are created equal

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:27.000
to every man, woman and child on this planet.

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:30.000
And we need to have the humility to recognize

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:33.000
that we cannot do it alone.

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:35.000
Robert Kennedy once said

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:38.000
that "few of us have the greatness to bend history itself,

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:41.000
but each of us can work

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:44.000
to change a small portion of events."

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:47.000
And it is in the total of all those acts

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:50.000
that the history of this generation will be written.

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:53.000
Our lives are so short,

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:55.000
and our time on this planet

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:57.000
is so precious,

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:00.000
and all we have is each other.

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:02.000
So may each of you

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:05.000
live lives of immersion.

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:08.000
They won't necessarily be easy lives,

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:12.000
but in the end, it is all that will sustain us.

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:14.000
Thank you.

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:24.000
(Applause)
