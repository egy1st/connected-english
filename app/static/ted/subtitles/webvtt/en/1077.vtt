00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
I'm speaking to you about what I call the "mesh."

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
It's essentially a fundamental shift

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
in our relationship with stuff, with the things in our lives.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
And it's starting to look at --

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
not always and not for everything --

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
but in certain moments of time,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
access to certain kinds of goods and service

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
will trump ownership of them.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
And so it's the pursuit of better things,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
easily shared.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
And we come from a long tradition of sharing.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
We've shared transportation.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
We've shared wine and food

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
and other sorts of fabulous experiences

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
in coffee bars in Amsterdam.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
We've also shared other sorts of entertainment --

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
sports arenas, public parks,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
concert halls, libraries,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
universities.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
All these things are share-platforms,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
but sharing ultimately starts and ends

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
with what I refer to

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
as the "mother of all share-platforms."

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
And as I think about the mesh

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
and I think about, well, what's driving it,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
how come it's happening now,

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
I think there's a number of vectors

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
that I want to give you as background.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
One is the recession --

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
that the recession has caused us

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
to rethink our relationship

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
with the things in our lives relative to the value --

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
so starting to align the value

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
with the true cost.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
Secondly, population growth

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
and density into cities.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
More people, smaller spaces,

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
less stuff.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
Climate change:

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
we're trying to reduce the stress

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
in our personal lives and in our communities

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
and on the planet.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
Also, there's been this recent distrust

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
of big brands, global big brands,

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
in a bunch of different industries,

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
and that's created an opening.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
Research is showing here, in the States,

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
and in Canada and Western Europe,

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
that most of us are much more open

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
to local companies,

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
or brands that maybe we haven't heard of.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
Whereas before, we went with the big brands

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
that we were sure we trusted.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
And last is that

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
we're more connected now to more people on the planet

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
than ever before --

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
except for if you're sitting next to someone.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
(Laughter)

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
The other thing that's worth considering

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000
is that we've made a huge investment

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
over decades and decades,

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
and tens of billions of dollars

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
have gone into this investment

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
that now is our inheritance.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
It's a physical infrastructure

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
that allows us to get from point A to point B

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
and move things that way.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
It's also -- Web and mobile

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
allow us to be connected

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000
and create all kinds of platforms and systems,

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
and the investment of those technologies

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
and that infrastructure

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
is really our inheritance.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
It allows us to engage

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
in really new and interesting ways.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000
And so for me, a mesh company, the "classic" mesh company,

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
brings together these three things:

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000
our ability to connect to each other --

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
most of us are walking around with these mobile devices

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
that are GPS-enabled and Web-enabled --

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
allows us to find each other

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
and find things in time and space.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000
And third is that physical things

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000
are readable on a map --

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000
so restaurants, a variety of venues,

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
but also with GPS and other technology

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000
like RFID

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
and it continues to expand beyond that,

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
we can also track things that are moving,

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000
like a car, a taxicab, a transit system,

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
a box that's moving through time and space.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000
And so that sets up

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.000
for making access to get goods and services

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
more convenient and less costly in many cases

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
than owning them.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
For example, I want to use Zipcar.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000
How many people here have experienced

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.000
car-sharing or bike-sharing?

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000
Wow, that's great. Okay, thank you.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000
Basically Zipcar

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.000
is the largest car-sharing company in the world.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000
They did not invent car-sharing.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000
Car-sharing was actually invented in Europe.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000
One of the founders went to Switzerland,

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000
saw it implemented someplace,

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000
said, "Wow, that looks really cool.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000
I think we can do that in Cambridge,"

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000
brought it to Cambridge

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000
and they started -- two women --

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000
Robin Chase being the other person who started it.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000
Zipcar got some really important things right.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000
First, they really understood

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.000
that a brand is a voice and a product is a souvenir.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000
And so they were very clever

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000
about the way that they packaged car-sharing.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000
They made it sexy. They made it fresh.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000
They made it aspirational.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000
If you were a member of the club,

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000
when you're a member of a club, you're a Zipster.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.000
The cars they picked didn't look like ex-cop cars

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000
that were hollowed out or something.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000
They picked these sexy cars.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000
They targeted to universities.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000
They made sure that the demographic

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000
for who they were targeting and the car was all matching.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000
It was a very nice experience,

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000
and the cars were clean and reliable, and it all worked.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.000
And so from a branding perspective, they got a lot right.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.000
But they understood fundamentally

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000
that they are not a car company.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.000
They understand that they are an information company.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000
Because when we buy a car

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.000
we go to the dealer once, we have an interaction, and we're chow --

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000
usually as quickly as possible.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.000
But when you're sharing a car and you have a car-share service,

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000
you might use an E.V. to commute,

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000
you get a truck because you're doing a home project.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000
When you pick your aunt up at the airport, you get a sedan.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.000
And you're going to the mountains to ski,

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000
you get different accessories put on the car

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000
for doing that sort of thing.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000
Meanwhile, these guys are sitting back,

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.000
collecting all sorts of data

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.000
about our behavior and how we interact with the service.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.000
And so it's not only an option for them,

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000
but I believe it's an imperative

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000
for Zipcar and other mesh companies

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.000
to actually just wow us,

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.000
to be like a concierge service.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.000
Because we give them so much information,

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.000
and they are entitled to really see

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000
how it is that we're moving.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000
They're in really good shape to anticipate

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000
what we're going to want next.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.000
And so what percent of the day

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.000
do you think the average person uses a car?

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.000
What percentage of the time?

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000
Any guesses?

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000
Those are really very good.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000
I was imagining it was like

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000
20 percent when I first started.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.000
The number across the U.S. and Western Europe

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.000
is eight percent.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:15.000
And so basically even if you think it's 10 percent,

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000
90 percent of the time,

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.000
something that costs us a lot of money --

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.000
personally, and also we organize our cities around it

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.000
and all sorts of things --

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.000
90 percent of the time it's sitting around.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000
So for this reason,

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000
I think one of the other themes with the mesh

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000
is essentially that, if we squeeze hard

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000
on things that we've thrown away,

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000
there's a lot of value in those things.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.000
What set up with Zipcar -- Zipcar started in 2000.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.000
In the last year, 2010,

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.000
two car companies started,

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:46.000
one that's in the U.K. called WhipCar,

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.000
and the other one, RelayRides, in the U.S.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.000
They're both peer-to-peer car-sharing services,

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.000
because the two things that really work for car-sharing

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.000
is, one, the car has to be available,

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.000
and two, it's within one or two blocks

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000
of where you stand.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.000
Well the car that's one or two blocks from your home or your office

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.000
is probably your neighbor's car,

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.000
and it's probably also available.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:10.000
So people have created this business.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.000
Zipcar started a decade earlier,

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.000
in 2000.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.000
It took them six years

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.000
to get 1,000 cars in service.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.000
WhipCar, which started April of last year,

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.000
it took them six months

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.000
to get 1,000 cars in the service.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.000
So, really interesting.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.000
People are making anywhere between

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000
200 and 700 dollars a month

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.000
letting their neighbors use their car when they're not using it.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.000
So it's like vacation rentals for cars.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.000
Since I'm here --

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.000
and I hope some people in the audience

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.000
are in the car business --

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.000
(Laughter)

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.000
-- I'm thinking that, coming from the technology side of things --

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:51.000
we saw cable-ready TVs

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:54.000
and WiFi-ready Notebooks --

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.000
it would be really great if, any minute now,

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:00.000
you guys could start rolling share-ready cars off.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000
Because it just creates more flexibility.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:05.000
It allows us as owners to have other options.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.000
And I think we're going there anyway.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:10.000
The opportunity and the challenge with mesh businesses --

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000
and those are businesses like Zipcar or Netflix

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.000
that are full mesh businesses,

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.000
or other ones where you have a lot of the car companies,

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.000
car manufacturers,

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.000
who are beginning to offer

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.000
their own car-share services

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000
as well as a second flanker brand,

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000
or as really a test, I think --

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.000
is to make sharing irresistible.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.000
We have experiences in our lives, certainly,

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.000
when sharing has been irresistible.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.000
It's just, how do we make that recurrent

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.000
and scale it?

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.000
We know also, because we're connected in social networks,

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.000
that it's easy to create delight

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000
in one little place.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:49.000
It's contagious because we're all connected to each other.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000
So if I have a terrific experience

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:55.000
and I tweet it, or I tell five people standing next to me, news travels.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.000
The opposite, as we know, is also true,

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.000
often more true.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.000
So here we have LudoTruck, which is in L.A.,

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.000
doing the things that gourmet food trucks do,

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:06.000
and they've gathered quite a following.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:09.000
In general, and maybe, again, it's because I'm a tech entrepreneur,

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.000
I look at things as platforms.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.000
Platforms are invitations.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.000
So creating Craigslist

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:18.000
or iTunes and the iPhone developer network,

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.000
there are all these networks -- Facebook as well.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:23.000
These platforms invite all sorts of developers

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.000
and all sorts of people

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.000
to come with their ideas and their opportunity

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:30.000
to create and target an application

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.000
for a particular audience.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.000
And honestly, it's full of surprises.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:37.000
Because I don't think any of us in this room

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.000
could have predicted the sorts of applications

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:42.000
that have happened at Facebook, around Facebook,

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:44.000
for example, two years ago,

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.000
when Mark announced

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.000
that they were going to go with a platform.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:51.000
So in this way, I think that cities are platforms,

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:54.000
and certainly Detroit is a platform.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.000
The invitation of bringing

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.000
makers and artists and entrepreneurs --

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:01.000
it really helps stimulate this fiery creativity

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.000
and helps a city to thrive.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.000
It's inviting participation,

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.000
and cities have, historically,

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.000
invited all sorts of participation.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:12.000
Now we're saying that there's other options as well.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.000
So, for example, city departments

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.000
can open up transit data.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:19.000
Google has made available transit data API.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:22.000
And so there's about seven or eight cities already in the U.S.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.000
that have provided the transit data,

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.000
and different developers are building applications.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:29.000
So I was having a coffee in Portland,

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:32.000
and half-of-a-latte in

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:35.000
and the little board in the cafe

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.000
all of a sudden starts showing me

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.000
that the next bus is coming in three minutes

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.000
and the train is coming in 16 minutes.

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.000
And so it's reliable, real data

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.000
that's right in my face, where I am,

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:48.000
so I can finish the latte.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.000
There's this fabulous opportunity we have across the U.S. now:

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.000
about 21 percent

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:55.000
of vacant commercial and industrial space.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:58.000
That space is not vital.

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:01.000
The areas around it lack vitality

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:03.000
and vibrancy and engagement.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:05.000
There's this thing -- how many people here

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:08.000
have heard of pop-up stores or pop-up shops?

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:11.000
Oh, great. So I'm a big fan of this.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:14.000
And this is a very mesh-y thing.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:17.000
Essentially, there are all sorts

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:20.000
of restaurants in Oakland, near where I live.

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:23.000
There's a pop-up general store every three weeks,

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.000
and they do a fantastic job

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:28.000
of making a very social event

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.000
happening for foodies.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:34.000
Super fun, and it happens in a very transitional neighborhood.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.000
Subsequent to that,

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:39.000
after it's been going for about a year now,

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:42.000
they actually started to lease and create and extend.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:45.000
An area that was edgy-artsy

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:47.000
is now starting to become much cooler

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.000
and engage a lot more people.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.000
So this is an example.

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:54.000
The Crafty Fox is this woman who's into crafts,

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:57.000
and she does these pop-up crafts fairs around London.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.000
But these sorts of things are happening

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.000
in many different environments.

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:04.000
From my perspective, one of the things pop-up stores do

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:07.000
is create perishability and urgency.

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:10.000
It creates two of the favorite words of any businessperson:

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.000
sold out.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:15.000
And the opportunity to really focus trust and attention

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:18.000
is a wonderful thing.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.000
So a lot of what we see in the mesh,

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.000
and a lot of what we have in the platform that we built

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:25.000
allows us to define, refine and scale.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:28.000
It allows us to test things as an entrepreneur,

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.000
to go to market,

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.000
to be in conversation with people,

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:35.000
listen, refine something and go back.

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:37.000
It's very cost-effective,

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.000
and it's very mesh-y.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:42.000
The infrastructure enables that.

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:46.000
In closing, and as we're moving towards the end,

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.000
I just also want to encourage --

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.000
and I'm willing to share my failures as well,

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:52.000
though not from the stage.

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.000
(Laughter)

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.000
I would just like to say that one of the big things,

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.000
when we look at waste

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.000
and when we look at ways that we can really be generous

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.000
and contribute to each other,

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:05.000
but also move to create a better economic situation

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:08.000
and a better environmental situation,

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:10.000
is by sharing failures.

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.000
And one quick example

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.000
is Velib, in 2007,

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.000
came forward in Paris

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.000
with a very bold proposition,

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:20.000
a very big bike-sharing service.

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.000
They made a lot of mistakes.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.000
They had some number of big successes.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:27.000
But they were very transparent, or they had to be,

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:30.000
in the way that they exposed

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.000
what worked and didn't work.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:35.000
And so B.C. in Barcelona

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:37.000
and B-cycle

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:39.000
and Boris Bikes in London --

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:41.000
no one has had to repeat

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:44.000
the version 1.0 screw-ups

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:46.000
and expensive learning exercises

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.000
that happened in Paris.

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:51.000
So the opportunity when we're connected

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:54.000
is also to share failures and successes.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.000
We're at the very beginning of something

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:58.000
that, what we're seeing

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:00.000
and the way that mesh companies are coming forward,

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:03.000
is inviting, it's engaging, but it's very early.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:06.000
I have a website -- it's a directory --

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:08.000
and it started with about 1,200 companies,

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:10.000
and in the last two-and-a-half months

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:12.000
it's up to about 3,300 companies.

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:16.000
And it grows on a very regular daily basis.

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.000
But it's very much at the beginning.

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:21.000
So I just want to welcome all of you onto the ride.

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:23.000
And thank you very much.

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:26.000
(Applause)
