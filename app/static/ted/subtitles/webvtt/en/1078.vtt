00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Pat Mitchell: What is the story of this pin?

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Madeleine Albright: This is "Breaking the Glass Ceiling."

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
PM: Oh.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
That was well chosen, I would say, for TEDWomen.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
MA: Most of the time I spend when I get up in the morning

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
is trying to figure out what is going to happen.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
And none of this pin stuff would have happened

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
if it hadn't been for Saddam Hussein.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
I'll tell you what happened.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
I went to the United Nations as an ambassador,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
and it was after the Gulf War,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
and I was an instructed ambassador.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
And the cease-fire had been translated

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
into a series of sanctions resolutions,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
and my instructions

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
were to say perfectly terrible things about Saddam Hussein constantly,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
which he deserved -- he had invaded another country.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
And so all of a sudden, a poem appeared in the papers in Baghdad

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
comparing me to many things,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
but among them an "unparalleled serpent."

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
And so I happened to have a snake pin.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
So I wore it when we talked about Iraq.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
(Laughter)

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
And when I went out to meet the press,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
they zeroed in, said, "Why are you wearing that snake pin?"

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
I said, "Because Saddam Hussein compared me to an unparalleled serpent."

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
And then I thought, well this is fun.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
So I went out and I bought a lot of pins

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
that would, in fact, reflect

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
what I thought we were going to do on any given day.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
So that's how it all started.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
PM: So how large is the collection?

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
MA: Pretty big.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
It's now traveling.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
At the moment it's in Indianapolis,

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
but it was at the Smithsonian.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
And it goes with a book that says, "Read My Pins."

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
(Laughter)

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
PM: So is this a good idea.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
I remember when you were the first woman

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
as Secretary of State,

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
and there was a lot of conversation always

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
about what you were wearing,

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
how you looked --

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
the thing that happens to a lot of women,

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
especially if they're the first in a position.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
So how do you feel about that -- the whole --

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
MA: Well, it's pretty irritating actually

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
because nobody ever describes what a man is wearing.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
But people did pay attention to what clothes I had.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
What was interesting was that,

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
before I went up to New York as U.N. ambassador,

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
I talked to Jeane Kirkpatrick, who'd been ambassador before me,

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
and she said, "You've got to get rid of your professor clothes.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
Go out and look like a diplomat."

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000
So that did give me a lot of opportunities to go shopping.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000
But still, there were all kinds of questions

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000
about -- "did you wear a hat?" "How short was your skirt?"

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
And one of the things --

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000
if you remember Condoleezza Rice was at some event and she wore boots,

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
and she got criticized over that.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
And no guy ever gets criticized. But that's the least of it.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
PM: It is, for all of us, men and women,

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
finding our ways of defining our roles,

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
and doing them in ways that make a difference in the world

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
and shape the future.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000
How did you handle that balance

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000
between being the tough diplomatic

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000
and strong voice of this country

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
to the rest of the world

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
and also how you felt about yourself

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
as a mother, a grandmother, nurturing ...

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
and so how did you handle that?

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
MA: Well the interesting part was I was asked

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
what it was like to be the first woman Secretary of State

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
a few minutes after I'd been named.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
And I said, "Well I've been a woman for 60 years,

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000
but I've only been Secretary of State for a few minutes."

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
So it evolved.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
(Laughter)

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000
But basically I love being a woman.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
And so what happened --

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
and I think there will probably be some people in the audience

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
that will identify with this --

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000
I went to my first meeting, first at the U.N.,

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
and that's when this all started,

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000
because that is a very male organization.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
And I'm sitting there -- there are 15 members of the Security Council --

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.000
so 14 men sat there staring at me,

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000
and I thought -- well you know how we all are.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000
You want to get the feeling of the room,

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000
and "do people like me?"

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000
and "will I really say something intelligent?"

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000
And all of a sudden I thought, "Well, wait a minute.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000
I am sitting behind a sign that says 'The United States,'

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000
and if I don't speak today

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.000
then the voice of the United States will not be heard,"

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000
and it was the first time that I had that feeling

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000
that I had to step out of myself

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.000
in my normal, reluctant female mode

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.000
and decide that I had to speak on behalf of our country.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.000
And so that happened more at various times,

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.000
but I really think that there was a great advantage in many ways

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000
to being a woman.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000
I think we are a lot better

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000
at personal relationships,

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000
and then have the capability obviously

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.000
of telling it like it is when it's necessary.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000
But I have to tell you, I have my youngest granddaughter,

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000
when she turned seven last year,

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
said to her mother, my daughter,

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000
"So what's the big deal about Grandma Maddie being Secretary of State?

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000
Only girls are Secretary of State."

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000
(Laughter)

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:44.000
(Applause)

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.000
PM: Because in her lifetime -- MA: That would be so.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000
PM: What a change that is.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.000
As you travel now all over the world,

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000
which you do frequently,

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000
how do you assess

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000
this global narrative around the story of women and girls?

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000
Where are we?

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000
MA: I think we're slowly changing,

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000
but obviously there are whole pockets

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000
in countries where nothing is different.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.000
And therefore it means that we have to remember

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.000
that, while many of us have had huge opportunities --

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.000
and Pat, you have been a real leader in your field --

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000
is that there are a lot of women

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000
that are not capable

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000
of worrying and taking care of themselves

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.000
and understanding that women have to help other women.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000
And so what I have felt --

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000
and I have looked at this

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000
from a national security issue --

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.000
when I was Secretary of State, I decided

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.000
that women's issues had to be central to American foreign policy,

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000
not just because I'm a feminist,

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.000
but because I believe that societies are better off

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.000
when women are politically and economically empowered,

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.000
that values are passed down,

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.000
the health situation is better,

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.000
education is better,

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000
there is greater economic prosperity.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.000
So I think that it behooves us --

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.000
those of us that live in various countries

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.000
where we do have economic and political voice --

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000
that we need to help other women.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.000
And I really dedicated myself to that,

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.000
both at the U.N. and then as Secretary of State.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000
PM: And did you get pushback

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.000
from making that a central tenant of foreign policy?

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.000
MA: From some people.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.000
I think that they thought that it was a soft issue.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000
The bottom line that I decided

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.000
was actually women's issues are the hardest issues,

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.000
because they are the ones that have to do with life and death

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000
in so many aspects,

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000
and because, as I said,

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.000
it is really central to the way that we think about things.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000
Now for instance,

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.000
some of the wars that took place

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.000
when I was in office,

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:46.000
a lot of them, the women were the main victims of it.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.000
For instance, when I started,

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.000
there were wars in the Balkans.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.000
The women in Bosnia were being raped.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.000
We then managed to set up a war crimes tribunal

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.000
to deal specifically with those kinds of issues.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.000
And by the way, one of the things that I did at that stage

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.000
was, I had just arrived at the U.N.,

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.000
and when I was there, there were 183 countries in the U.N.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000
Now there are 192.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.000
But it was one of the first times that I didn't have to cook lunch myself.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.000
So I said to my assistant,

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:19.000
"Invite the other women permanent representatives."

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.000
And I thought when I'd get to my apartment

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.000
that there'd be a lot of women there.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:26.000
I get there, and there are six other women, out of 183.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.000
So the countries that had women representatives

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000
were Canada, Kazakhstan, Philippines,

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.000
Trinidad Tobago, Jamaica,

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:36.000
Lichtenstein and me.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.000
So being an American, I decided to set up a caucus.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.000
(Laughter)

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.000
And so we set it up,

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.000
and we called ourselves the G7.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.000
(Laughter)

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.000
PM: Is that "Girl 7?" MA: Girl 7.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.000
And we lobbied

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.000
on behalf of women's issues.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:56.000
So we managed to get two women judges

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.000
on this war crimes tribunal.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000
And then what happened

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.000
was that they were able to declare that rape was a weapon of war,

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.000
that it was against humanity.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:10.000
(Applause)

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000
PM: So when you look around the world

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.000
and you see that, in many cases --

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.000
certainly in the Western world --

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:19.000
women are evolving into more leadership positions,

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.000
and even other places

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:24.000
some barriers are being brought down,

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.000
but there's still so much violence,

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.000
still so many problems,

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000
and yet we hear there are more women

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.000
at the negotiating tables.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.000
Now you were at those negotiating tables

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:38.000
when they weren't, when there was maybe you --

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.000
one voice, maybe one or two others.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:43.000
Do you believe, and can you tell us why,

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:46.000
there is going to be a significant shift

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.000
in things like violence

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.000
and peace and conflict and resolution

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.000
on a sustainable basis?

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:56.000
MA: Well I do think, when there are more women,

00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:00.000
that the tone of the conversation changes,

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.000
and also the goals of the conversation change.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.000
But it doesn't mean that the whole world

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.000
would be a lot better

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.000
if it were totally run by women.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.000
If you think that, you've forgotten high school.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.000
(Laughter)

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.000
But the bottom line

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.000
is that there is a way,

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:22.000
when there are more women at the table,

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.000
that there's an attempt

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.000
to develop some understanding.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:29.000
So for instance, what I did when I went to Burundi,

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:32.000
we'd got Tutsi and Hutu women together

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.000
to talk about some of the problems

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.000
that had taken place in Rwanda.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.000
And so I think the capability of women

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.000
to put themselves --

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:44.000
I think we're better about putting ourselves into the other guy's shoes

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.000
and having more empathy.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:49.000
I think it helps in terms of the support

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.000
if there are other women in the room.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.000
When I was Secretary of State,

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:56.000
there were only 13 other women foreign ministers.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:59.000
And so it was nice when one of them would show up.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:02.000
For instance, she is now the president of Finland,

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:05.000
but Tarja Halonen was the foreign minister of Finland

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:08.000
and, at a certain stage, head of the European Union.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.000
And it was really terrific.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.000
Because one of the things I think you'll understand.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.000
We went to a meeting,

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.000
and the men in my delegation,

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:19.000
when I would say, "Well I feel we should do something about this,"

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:22.000
and they'd say, "What do you mean, you feel?"

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:25.000
And so then Tarja was sitting across the table from me.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:28.000
And all of a sudden we were talking about arms control,

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.000
and she said, "Well I feel we should do this."

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:33.000
And my male colleagues kind of got it all of a sudden.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.000
But I think it really does help

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:38.000
to have a critical mass of women

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:41.000
in a series of foreign policy positions.

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:44.000
The other thing that I think is really important:

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.000
A lot of national security policy

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.000
isn't just about foreign policy,

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:51.000
but it's about budgets, military budgets,

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:54.000
and how the debts of countries work out.

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.000
So if you have women

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:59.000
in a variety of foreign policy posts,

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.000
they can support each other

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:04.000
when there are budget decisions being made in their own countries.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:06.000
PM: So how do we get

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:09.000
this balance we're looking for, then, in the world?

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.000
More women's voices at the table?

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.000
More men who believe

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.000
that the balance is best?

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.000
MA: Well I think one of the things --

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.000
I'm chairman of the board of an organization

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.000
called the National Democratic Institute

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:24.000
that works to support women candidates.

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.000
I think that we need

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.000
to help in other countries

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.000
to train women

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.000
to be in political office,

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.000
to figure out how they can in fact

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.000
develop political voices.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:39.000
I think we also need to be supportive

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:42.000
when businesses are being created

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:44.000
and just make sure that women help each other.

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:46.000
Now I have a saying

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.000
that I feel very strongly about,

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.000
because I am of a certain age

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.000
where, when I started in my career,

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:55.000
believe it or not, there were other women who criticized me:

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:58.000
"Why aren't you in the carpool line?"

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.000
or "Aren't your children suffering

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.000
because you're not there all the time?"

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:05.000
And I think we have a tendency to make each other feel guilty.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:09.000
In fact, I think "guilt" is every woman's middle name.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:11.000
And so I think what needs to happen

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:14.000
is we need to help each other.

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.000
And my motto is that there's a special place in hell

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:19.000
for women who don't help each other.

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:27.000
(Applause)

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:30.000
PM: Well Secretary Albright, I guess you'll be going to heaven.

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:33.000
Thank you for joining us today.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:36.000
MA: Thank you all. Thanks Pat.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.000
(Applause)
