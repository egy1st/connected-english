WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
It's Monday morning.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
In Washington,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
the president of the United States

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
is sitting in the Oval Office,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
assessing whether or not

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
to strike Al Qaeda

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
in Yemen.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
At Number 10 Downing Street,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
David Cameron is trying to work out

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
whether to cut more public sector jobs

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
in order to stave off a double-dip recession.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
In Madrid, Maria Gonzalez

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
is standing at the door,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
listening to her baby crying and crying,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
trying to work out whether she should let it cry

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
until it falls asleep

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
or pick it up and hold it.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
And I am sitting by my father's bedside in hospital,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
trying to work out

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
whether I should let him drink

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
the one-and-a-half-liter bottle of water

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
that his doctors just came in and said,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
"You must make him drink today," --

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
my father's been nil by mouth for a week --

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000
or whether, by giving him this bottle,

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
I might actually kill him.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
We face momentous decisions

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
with important consequences

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
throughout our lives,

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
and we have strategies for dealing with these decisions.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
We talk things over with our friends,

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
we scour the Internet,

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
we search through books.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
But still,

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
even in this age

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
of Google and TripAdvisor

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
and Amazon Recommends,

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
it's still experts

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
that we rely upon most --

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
especially when the stakes are high

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
and the decision really matters.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
Because in a world of data deluge

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
and extreme complexity,

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
we believe that experts

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
are more able to process information than we can --

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000
that they are able to come to better conclusions

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
than we could come to on our own.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
And in an age

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
that is sometimes nowadays frightening

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
or confusing,

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
we feel reassured

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000
by the almost parental-like authority

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
of experts

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000
who tell us so clearly what it is

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000
we can and cannot do.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
But I believe

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
that this is a big problem,

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.000
a problem with potentially dangerous consequences

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000
for us as a society,

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
as a culture

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
and as individuals.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000
It's not that experts

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
have not massively contributed to the world --

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
of course they have.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000
The problem lies with us:

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000
we've become addicted to experts.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000
We've become addicted to their certainty,

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
their assuredness,

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
their definitiveness,

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
and in the process,

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
we have ceded our responsibility,

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000
substituting our intellect

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000
and our intelligence

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
for their supposed words of wisdom.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000
We've surrendered our power,

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
trading off our discomfort

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
with uncertainty

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000
for the illusion of certainty

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000
that they provide.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000
This is no exaggeration.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
In a recent experiment,

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
a group of adults

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.000
had their brains scanned in an MRI machine

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.000
as they were listening to experts speak.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000
The results were quite extraordinary.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.000
As they listened to the experts' voices,

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:46.000
the independent decision-making parts of their brains

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000
switched off.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.000
It literally flat-lined.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000
And they listened to whatever the experts said

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.000
and took their advice, however right or wrong.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
But experts do get things wrong.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.000
Did you know that studies show

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.000
that doctors misdiagnose

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.000
four times out of 10?

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000
Did you know

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000
that if you file your tax returns yourself,

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000
you're statistically more likely

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000
to be filing them correctly

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000
than if you get a tax adviser

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000
to do it for you?

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.000
And then there's, of course, the example

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000
that we're all too aware of:

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000
financial experts

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000
getting it so wrong

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000
that we're living through the worst recession

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000
since the 1930s.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000
For the sake of our health,

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000
our wealth

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000
and our collective security,

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.000
it's imperative that we keep

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:50.000
the independent decision-making parts of our brains

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
switched on.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000
And I'm saying this as an economist

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000
who, over the past few years,

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000
has focused my research

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000
on what it is we think

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000
and who it is we trust and why,

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000
but also --

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000
and I'm aware of the irony here --

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.000
as an expert myself,

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000
as a professor,

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.000
as somebody who advises prime ministers,

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000
heads of big companies,

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000
international organizations,

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000
but an expert who believes

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.000
that the role of experts needs to change,

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.000
that we need to become more open-minded,

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000
more democratic

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000
and be more open

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.000
to people rebelling against

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.000
our points of view.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.000
So in order to help you understand

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000
where I'm coming from,

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.000
let me bring you into my world,

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000
the world of experts.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:50.000
Now there are, of course, exceptions,

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:56.000
wonderful, civilization-enhancing exceptions.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.000
But what my research has shown me

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.000
is that experts tend on the whole

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.000
to form very rigid camps,

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000
that within these camps,

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.000
a dominant perspective emerges

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.000
that often silences opposition,

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.000
that experts move with the prevailing winds,

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.000
often hero-worshipping

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.000
their own gurus.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.000
Alan Greenspan's proclamations

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.000
that the years of economic growth

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.000
would go on and on,

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.000
not challenged by his peers,

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.000
until after the crisis, of course.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.000
You see,

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.000
we also learn

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.000
that experts are located,

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.000
are governed,

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.000
by the social and cultural norms

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.000
of their times --

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.000
whether it be the doctors

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000
in Victorian England, say,

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.000
who sent women to asylums

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.000
for expressing sexual desire,

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.000
or the psychiatrists in the United States

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.000
who, up until 1973,

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:10.000
were still categorizing homosexuality

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.000
as a mental illness.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.000
And what all this means

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.000
is that paradigms

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:19.000
take far too long to shift,

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:23.000
that complexity and nuance are ignored

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:26.000
and also that money talks --

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.000
because we've all seen the evidence

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000
of pharmaceutical companies

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:34.000
funding studies of drugs

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000
that conveniently leave out

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.000
their worst side effects,

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.000
or studies funded by food companies

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:45.000
of their new products,

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.000
massively exaggerating the health benefits

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:51.000
of the products they're about to bring by market.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.000
The study showed that food companies exaggerated

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:56.000
typically seven times more

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:59.000
than an independent study.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000
And we've also got to be aware

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000
that experts, of course,

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.000
also make mistakes.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:09.000
They make mistakes every single day --

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:12.000
mistakes born out of carelessness.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.000
A recent study in the Archives of Surgery

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.000
reported surgeons

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:20.000
removing healthy ovaries,

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:23.000
operating on the wrong side of the brain,

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:26.000
carrying out procedures on the wrong hand,

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:29.000
elbow, eye, foot,

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:32.000
and also mistakes born out of thinking errors.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.000
A common thinking error

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:37.000
of radiologists, for example --

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:40.000
when they look at CT scans --

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000
is that they're overly influenced

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.000
by whatever it is

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000
that the referring physician has said

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.000
that he suspects

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.000
the patient's problem to be.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.000
So if a radiologist

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.000
is looking at the scan

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:58.000
of a patient with suspected pneumonia, say,

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.000
what happens is that,

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000
if they see evidence

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:05.000
of pneumonia on the scan,

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:08.000
they literally stop looking at it --

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.000
thereby missing the tumor

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.000
sitting three inches below

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.000
on the patient's lungs.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:19.000
I've shared with you so far

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:22.000
some insights into the world of experts.

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.000
These are, of course,

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.000
not the only insights I could share,

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:29.000
but I hope they give you a clear sense at least

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:32.000
of why we need to stop kowtowing to them,

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.000
why we need to rebel

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.000
and why we need to switch

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:40.000
our independent decision-making capabilities on.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:43.000
But how can we do this?

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:46.000
Well for the sake of time,

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:49.000
I want to focus on just three strategies.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.000
First, we've got to be ready and willing

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:56.000
to take experts on

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:59.000
and dispense with this notion of them

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.000
as modern-day apostles.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:04.000
This doesn't mean having to get a Ph.D.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.000
in every single subject,

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.000
you'll be relieved to hear.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:11.000
But it does mean persisting

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:14.000
in the face of their inevitable annoyance

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.000
when, for example,

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.000
we want them to explain things to us

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:22.000
in language that we can actually understand.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:26.000
Why was it that, when I had an operation,

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.000
my doctor said to me,

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.000
"Beware, Ms. Hertz,

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.000
of hyperpyrexia,"

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.000
when he could have just as easily said,

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:37.000
"Watch out for a high fever."

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:42.000
You see, being ready to take experts on

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.000
is about also being willing

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:47.000
to dig behind their graphs,

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.000
their equations, their forecasts,

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.000
their prophecies,

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:54.000
and being armed with the questions to do that --

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.000
questions like:

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:59.000
What are the assumptions that underpin this?

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:02.000
What is the evidence upon which this is based?

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:06.000
What has your investigation focused on?

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:09.000
And what has it ignored?

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.000
It recently came out

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:14.000
that experts trialing drugs

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.000
before they come to market

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:19.000
typically trial drugs

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:23.000
first, primarily on male animals

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:26.000
and then, primarily on men.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:29.000
It seems that they've somehow overlooked the fact

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:32.000
that over half the world's population are women.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:37.000
And women have drawn the short medical straw

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:40.000
because it now turns out that many of these drugs

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:43.000
don't work nearly as well on women

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.000
as they do on men --

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:48.000
and the drugs that do work well work so well

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:51.000
that they're actively harmful for women to take.

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:54.000
Being a rebel is about recognizing

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:57.000
that experts' assumptions

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.000
and their methodologies

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:02.000
can easily be flawed.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.000
Second,

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:07.000
we need to create the space

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:10.000
for what I call "managed dissent."

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.000
If we are to shift paradigms,

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.000
if we are to make breakthroughs,

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:17.000
if we are to destroy myths,

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:19.000
we need to create an environment

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:22.000
in which expert ideas are battling it out,

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:24.000
in which we're bringing in

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:27.000
new, diverse, discordant, heretical views

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:29.000
into the discussion,

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:31.000
fearlessly,

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:34.000
in the knowledge that progress comes about,

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:38.000
not only from the creation of ideas,

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:41.000
but also from their destruction --

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:44.000
and also from the knowledge

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:46.000
that, by surrounding ourselves

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:49.000
by divergent, discordant,

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:51.000
heretical views.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.000
All the research now shows us

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:57.000
that this actually makes us smarter.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:01.000
Encouraging dissent is a rebellious notion

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:04.000
because it goes against our very instincts,

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:07.000
which are to surround ourselves

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:09.000
with opinions and advice

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:12.000
that we already believe

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.000
or want to be true.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.000
And that's why I talk about the need

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:19.000
to actively manage dissent.

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.000
Google CEO Eric Schmidt

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:25.000
is a practical practitioner

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:27.000
of this philosophy.

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:30.000
In meetings, he looks out for the person in the room --

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:33.000
arms crossed, looking a bit bemused --

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:36.000
and draws them into the discussion,

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:39.000
trying to see if they indeed are

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:42.000
the person with a different opinion,

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:45.000
so that they have dissent within the room.

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.000
Managing dissent

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:50.000
is about recognizing the value

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:53.000
of disagreement, discord

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.000
and difference.

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:58.000
But we need to go even further.

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:01.000
We need to fundamentally redefine

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:04.000
who it is that experts are.

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:07.000
The conventional notion

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:10.000
is that experts are people

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:12.000
with advanced degrees,

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:15.000
fancy titles, diplomas,

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:17.000
best-selling books --

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:19.000
high-status individuals.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:21.000
But just imagine

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:23.000
if we were to junk

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:27.000
this notion of expertise

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:31.000
as some sort of elite cadre

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:34.000
and instead embrace the notion

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:37.000
of democratized expertise --

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:40.000
whereby expertise was not just the preserve

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.000
of surgeons and CEO's,

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:45.000
but also shop-girls -- yeah.

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.000
Best Buy,

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:50.000
the consumer electronics company,

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:53.000
gets all its employees --

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:55.000
the cleaners, the shop assistants,

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:58.000
the people in the back office,

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:00.000
not just its forecasting team --

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:03.000
to place bets, yes bets,

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:05.000
on things like whether or not

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:08.000
a product is going to sell well before Christmas,

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:11.000
on whether customers' new ideas

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:15.000
are going to be or should be taken on by the company,

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:17.000
on whether a project

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:19.000
will come in on time.

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:21.000
By leveraging

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:23.000
and by embracing

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:25.000
the expertise within the company,

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:28.000
Best Buy was able to discover, for example,

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:32.000
that the store that it was going to open in China --

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:34.000
its big, grand store --

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:37.000
was not going to open on time.

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:39.000
Because when it asked its staff,

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:42.000
all its staff, to place their bets

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:46.000
on whether they thought the store would open on time or not,

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:49.000
a group from the finance department

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:51.000
placed all their chips

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:54.000
on that not happening.

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:56.000
It turned out that they were aware,

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:59.000
as no one else within the company was,

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:01.000
of a technological blip

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:03.000
that neither the forecasting experts,

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:06.000
nor the experts on the ground in China,

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:09.000
were even aware of.

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:12.000
The strategies

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:15.000
that I have discussed this evening --

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:17.000
embracing dissent,

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:19.000
taking experts on,

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:21.000
democratizing expertise,

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:24.000
rebellious strategies --

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:26.000
are strategies that I think

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:28.000
would serve us all well to embrace

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:31.000
as we try to deal with the challenges

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:34.000
of these very confusing, complex,

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:36.000
difficult times.

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:38.000
For if we keep

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:40.000
our independent decision-making part

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:43.000
of our brains switched on,

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:46.000
if we challenge experts, if we're skeptical,

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:48.000
if we devolve authority,

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:50.000
if we are rebellious,

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:52.000
but also

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:54.000
if we become much more comfortable

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:56.000
with nuance,

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:59.000
uncertainty and doubt,

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:02.000
and if we allow our experts

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:04.000
to express themselves

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:06.000
using those terms too,

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:08.000
we will set ourselves up

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:10.000
much better

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:14.000
for the challenges of the 21st century.

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:17.000
For now, more than ever,

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:19.000
is not the time

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:21.000
to be blindly following,

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:23.000
blindly accepting,

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:26.000
blindly trusting.

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:29.000
Now is the time to face the world

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:32.000
with eyes wide open --

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:34.000
yes, using experts

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:37.000
to help us figure things out, for sure --

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:41.000
I don't want to completely do myself out of a job here --

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:43.000
but being aware

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:46.000
of their limitations

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:50.000
and, of course, also our own.

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:52.000
Thank you.

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:57.000
(Applause)
