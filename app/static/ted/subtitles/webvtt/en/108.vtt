00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Mockingbirds are badass.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:04.000
(Laughter)

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
They are.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Mockingbirds -- that's Mimus polyglottos --

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
are the emcees of the animal kingdom.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
They listen and mimic and remix what they like.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
They rock the mic outside my window every morning.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
I can hear them sing the sounds of the car alarms

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
like they were songs of spring.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
I mean, if you can talk it, a mockingbird can squawk it.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
So check it, I'm gonna to catch mockingbirds.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
I'm going to trap mockingbirds all across the nation

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
and put them gently into mason jars like mockingbird Molotov cocktails.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:30.000
(Laughter)

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Yeah. And as I drive through a neighborhood,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
say, where people got-a-lotta, I'll take a mockingbird I caught

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
in a neighborhood where folks ain't got nada and just let it go, you know.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
Up goes the bird, out come the words, "Juanito, Juanito,

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
vente a comer mi hijo!"

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
Oh, I'm going to be the Johnny Appleseed of sound.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:47.000
(Laughter)

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
Cruising random city streets, rocking a drop-top Cadillac

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
with a big backseat, packing like 13 brown paper Walmart bags

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
full of loaded mockingbirds, and I'll get everybody.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:57.000
(Laughter)

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
I'll get the nitwit on the network news saying,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
"We'll be back in a moment with more on the crisis."

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
I'll get some asshole at a watering hole asking what brand the ice is.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
I'll get that lady at the laundromat who always seems to know what being nice is.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
I'll get your postman making dinner plans.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
I'll get the last time you lied.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
I'll get, "Baby, just give me the frickin' TV guide."

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
I'll get a lonely, little sentence with real error in it,

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
"Yeah, I guess I could come inside, but only for a minute."

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.000
(Laughter)

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.000
I'll get an ESL class in Chinatown learning "It's Raining, It's Pouring."

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
I'll put a mockingbird on a late-night train just to get an old man snoring.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
I'll get your ex-lover telling someone else, "Good morning."

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
I'll get everyone's good mornings.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
I don't care how you make 'em.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000
Aloha. Konichiwa. Shalom. Ah-Salam Alaikum.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
Everybody means everybody, means everybody here.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
And so maybe I'll build a gilded cage.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
I'll line the bottom with old notebook pages.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
Inside it, I will place a mockingbird for --

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
short explanation, hippie parents.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.000
(Laughter)

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
What does a violin have to do with technology?

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
Where in the world is this world heading?

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
On one end, gold bars --

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
on the other, an entire planet.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
We are 12 billion light years from the edge.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.000
That's a guess.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
Space is length and breadth continued indefinitely,

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
but you cannot buy a ticket to travel commercially to space in America

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
because countries are beginning to eat like us, live like us and die like us.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
You might wanna avert your gaze, because that

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
is a newt about to regenerate its limb,

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
and shaking hands spreads more germs than kissing.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
There's about 10 million phage per job.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000
It's a very strange world inside a nanotube.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.000
Women can talk; black men ski; white men build strong buildings;

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
we build strong suns.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
The surface of the Earth is absolutely riddled with holes,

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.000
and here we are, right in the middle.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.000
(Laughter)

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000
It is the voice of life that calls us to come and learn.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
When all the little mockingbirds fly away,

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
they're going to sound like the last four days.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000
I will get uptown gurus, downtown teachers,

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
broke-ass artists and dealers, and Filipino preachers, leaf blowers,

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
bartenders, boob-job doctors, hooligans, garbage men,

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
your local Congressmen in the spotlight, guys in the overhead helicopters.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
Everybody gets heard.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.000
Everybody gets this one, honest mockingbird as a witness.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000
And I'm on this.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000
I'm on this 'til the whole thing spreads,

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000
with chat rooms and copycats and moms maybe tucking kids into bed

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000
singing, "Hush, little baby, don't say a word.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000
Wait for the man with the mockingbird."

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.000
(Laughter)

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
Yeah. And then come the news crews, and

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000
the man-in-the-street interviews, and the letters to the editor.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000
Everybody asking, just who is responsible for this citywide,

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000
nationwide mockingbird cacophony, and somebody finally is going to tip

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000
the City Council of Monterey, California off to me,

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000
and they'll offer me a key to the city.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
A gold-plated, oversized key to the city

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.000
and that is all I need, 'cause if I get that, I can unlock the air.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:39.000
I'll listen for what's missing, and I'll put it there.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:40.000
Thank you, TED.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.000
(Applause)

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:42.000
Chris Anderson: Wow.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:51.000
(Applause)

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.000
Wow.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:53.000
(Applause)
