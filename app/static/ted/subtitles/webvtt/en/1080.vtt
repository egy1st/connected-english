WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Our face is hugely important

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
because it's the external, visual part

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
that everybody else sees.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Let's not forget it's a functional entity.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
We have strong skull bones

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
that protect the most important organ in our body: the brain.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
It's where our senses are located, our special senses --

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
our vision, our speech,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
our hearing, our smell, our taste.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
And this bone

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
is peppered, as you can see, with the light shining through the skull

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
with cavities, the sinuses,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
which warm and moisten the air we breathe.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
But also imagine if they were filled with solid bone --

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
our head would be dead weight,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
we wouldn't be able to hold it erect,

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
we wouldn't be able to look at the world around us.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
This woman is slowly dying

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
because the benign tumors in her facial bones

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
have completely obliterated her mouth and her nose

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
so she can't breathe and eat.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
Attached to the facial bones

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000
that define our face's structure

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
are the muscles that deliver our facial expression,

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
our universal language of expression,

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
our social-signaling system.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
And overlying this is the skin drape,

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
which is a hugely complex

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
three-dimensional structure --

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
taking right-angled bends here and there,

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
having thin areas like the eyelids,

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
thick areas like the cheek, different colors.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
And then we have the sensual factor of the face.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
Where do we like to kiss people?

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
On the lips. Nibble the ears maybe.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
It's the face where we're attracted to with that.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
But let's not forget the hair.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
You're looking at the image on your left-hand side --

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
that's my son with his eyebrows present.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
Look how odd he looks with the eyebrows missing.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
There's a definite difference.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
And imagine if he had hair sprouting from the middle of his nose,

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
he'd look even odder still.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
Dysmorphophobia

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
is an extreme version

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
of the fact that we don't see ourselves

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
as others see us.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
It's a shocking truth

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
that we only see mirror images of ourselves,

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
and we only see ourselves

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
in freeze-frame photographic images

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
that capture a mere fraction of the time that we live.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
Dysmorphophobia

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
is a perversion of this

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
where people who may be very good looking

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
regard themselves as hideously ugly

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
and are constantly seeking surgery

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000
to correct their facial appearance.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000
They don't need this. They need psychiatric help.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
Max has kindly donated his photograph to me.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
He doesn't have dysmorphophobia, but I'm using his photograph

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
to illustrate the fact that he looks exactly like a dysmorphophobic.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000
In other words, he looks entirely normal.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000
Age is another thing

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
when our attitude toward our appearance changes.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000
So children judge themselves, learn to judge themselves,

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000
by the behavior of adults around them.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000
Here's a classic example: Rebecca has a benign blood vessel tumor

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.000
that's growing out through her skull, has obliterated her nose,

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
and she's having difficulty seeing.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
As you can see, it's blocking her vision.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
She's also in danger, when she damages this,

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000
of bleeding profusely.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000
Our research has shown

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000
that the parents and close loved ones of these children

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
adore them.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000
They've grown used to their face; they think they're special.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
Actually, sometimes the parents argue

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000
about whether these children should have the lesion removed.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000
And occasionally they suffer intense grief reactions

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000
because the child they've grown to love

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.000
has changed so dramatically and they don't recognize them.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
But other adults

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000
say incredibly painful things.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
They say, "How dare you take this child out of the house

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000
and terrify other people.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000
Shouldn't you be doing something about this? Why haven't you had it removed?"

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000
And other children in curiosity come up and poke the lesion,

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000
because -- a natural curiosity.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000
And that obviously alerts the child

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000
to their unusual nature.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000
After surgery, everything normalizes.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000
The adults behave more naturally,

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.000
and the children play more readily with other children.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.000
As teenagers --

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000
just think back to your teenage years --

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000
we're going through a dramatic

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
and often disproportionate change

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000
in our facial appearance.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000
We're trying to struggle to find our identity.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000
We crave the approval of our peers.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.000
So our facial appearance is vital to us

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000
as we're trying to project ourselves to the world.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000
Just remember that single acne spot

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000
that crippled you for several days.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.000
How long did you spend looking in the mirror every day,

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.000
practicing your sardonic look, practicing your serious look,

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000
trying to look like Sean Connery, as I did,

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000
trying to raise one eyebrow?

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000
It's a crippling time.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:35.000
I've chosen to show this profile view of Sue

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.000
because what it shows is her lower jaw jutting forward

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000
and her lower lip jutting forward.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.000
I'd like you all in the audience now to push your lower jaw forward.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000
Turn to the person next to you,

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000
push your lower jaws forward. Turn to the person next to you

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000
and look at them -- they look miserable.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.000
That's exactly what people used to say to Sue.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000
She wasn't miserable at all.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000
But people used to say to her, "Why are you so miserable?"

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.000
People were making misjudgments all the time

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000
on her mood.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000
Teachers and peers were underestimating her; she was teased at school.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000
So she chose to have facial surgery.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000
After the facial surgery,

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.000
she said, "My face now reflects my personality.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.000
People know now that I'm enthusiastic,

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000
that I'm a happy person."

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:22.000
And that's the change that can be achieved for teenagers.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000
Is this change, though, a real change,

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.000
or is it a figment of the imagination

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000
of the patient themselves?

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000
Well we studied teenagers' attitudes

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.000
to photographs of patients having this corrective facial surgery.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.000
And what we found was --

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.000
we jumbled up the photographs

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000
so they couldn't recognize the before and after --

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000
what we found was that the patients were regarded

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.000
as being more attractive after the surgery.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.000
Well that's not surprising, but we also asked them to judge them

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.000
on honesty, intelligence,

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.000
friendliness, violence.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.000
They were all perceived as being

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000
less than normal in all those characteristics --

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.000
more violent, etc. -- before the surgery.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000
After the surgery,

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.000
they were perceived as being more intelligent,

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.000
more friendly, more honest, less violent --

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000
and yet we hadn't operated on their intellect

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000
or their character.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000
When people get older,

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.000
they don't necessarily choose to follow this kind of surgery.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000
Their presence in the consultation suite

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.000
is a result of the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000
What happens to them

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000
is that they may have suffered cancer or trauma.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000
So this is a photograph of Henry,

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.000
two weeks after he had a malignant cancer removed

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.000
from the left side of his face -- his cheekbone,

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000
his upper jaw, his eye-socket.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000
He looks pretty good at this stage.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.000
But over the course of the next 15 years he had 14 more operations,

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.000
as the disease ravaged his face

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.000
and destroyed my reconstruction regularly.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.000
I learned a huge amount from Henry.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000
Henry taught me

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000
that you can carry on working.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:52.000
He worked as an advocate. He continued to play cricket.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000
He enjoyed life to the full,

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000
and this was probably because he had a successful, fulfilling job

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.000
and a caring family

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000
and was able to participate socially.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.000
He maintained a calm insouciance.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.000
I don't say he overcame this; he didn't overcome it.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.000
This was something more than that. He ignored it.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.000
He ignored the disfigurement that was happening in his life

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.000
and carried on oblivious to it.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.000
And that's what these people can do.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.000
Henriapi illustrates this phenomenon as well.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.000
This is a man in his 20s

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.000
whose first visit out of Nigeria was with this malignant cancer

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.000
that he came to the United Kingdom to have operated on.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.000
It was my longest operation.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:31.000
It took 23 hours. I did it with my neurosurgeon.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.000
We removed all the bones at the right side of his face --

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.000
his eye, his nose,

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.000
the skull bones, the facial skin --

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:40.000
and reconstructed him with tissue from the back.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.000
He continued to work as a psychiatric nurse.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:45.000
He got married. He had a son called Jeremiah.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.000
And again, he said,

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:50.000
"This painting of me with my son Jeremiah

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:53.000
shows me as the successful man that I feel that I am."

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.000
His facial disfigurement

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.000
did not affect him

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.000
because he had the support of a family;

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.000
he had a successful, fulfilling job.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:04.000
So we've seen that we can change people's faces.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.000
But when we change people's faces,

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.000
are we changing their identity --

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:11.000
for better or for worse?

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.000
For instance,

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.000
there are two different types of facial surgery.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.000
We can categorize it like that.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.000
We can say there are patients who choose to have facial surgery --

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.000
like Sue.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.000
When they have facial surgery,

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.000
they feel their lives have changed

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:28.000
because other people perceive them

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.000
as better people.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000
They don't feel different.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.000
They feel that they've actually gained

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.000
what they never had,

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.000
that their face now reflects their personality.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:41.000
And actually that's probably the difference between cosmetic surgery

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.000
and this kind of surgery.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:46.000
Because you might say, "Well, this type of surgery

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.000
might be regarded as cosmetic."

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.000
If you do cosmetic surgery, patients are often less happy.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:54.000
They're trying to achieve difference in their lives.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.000
Sue wasn't trying to achieve difference in her life.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.000
She was just trying to achieve the face

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.000
that matched her personality.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.000
But then we have other people

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.000
who don't choose to have facial surgery.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.000
They're people who have their face shot off.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.000
I'll move it off, and we'll have a blank slide for those who are squeamish amongst you.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.000
They have it forced upon them.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.000
And again, as I told you,

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.000
if they have a caring family

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:21.000
and good work life,

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:24.000
then they can lead normal and fulfilled lives.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.000
Their identity doesn't change.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.000
Is this business

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.000
about appearance and preoccupation with it

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.000
a Western phenomenon?

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:35.000
Muzetta's family give the lie to this.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:38.000
This is a little Bangladeshi girl from the east end of London

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:41.000
who's got a huge malignant tumor on the right side of her face,

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.000
which has already made her blind

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.000
and which is rapidly growing and is going to kill her shortly.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:48.000
After she had surgery to remove the tumor,

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:51.000
her parents dressed her in this beautiful green velvet dress,

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.000
a pink ribbon in her hair,

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.000
and they wanted the painting to be shown around the world,

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:58.000
despite the fact that they were orthodox Muslims

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.000
and the mother wore a full burqa.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.000
So it's not simply a Western phenomenon.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.000
We make judgments on people's faces

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.000
all the time.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:12.000
It's been going on since we can think of Lombroso

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.000
and the way he would define criminal faces.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.000
He said you could see criminal faces,

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:19.000
judging them just on the photographs that were showed.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.000
Good-looking people

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.000
are always judged as being more friendly.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.000
We look at O.J. --

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.000
he's a good-looking guy.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:30.000
We'd like to spend time with him. He looks friendly.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:33.000
Now we know that he's a convicted wife-batterer,

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.000
and actually he's not the good guy.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:39.000
And beauty doesn't equate to goodness,

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:42.000
and certainly doesn't equate to contentment.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.000
So we've talked about the static face

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.000
and judging the static face,

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.000
but actually, we're more comfortable

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.000
with judging the moving face.

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:53.000
We think we can judge people on their expressions.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:56.000
U.K. jurors in the U.K. justice system

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.000
like to see a live witness

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:01.000
to see whether they can pick up the telltale signs of mendacity --

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:04.000
the blink, the hesitation.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:07.000
And so they want to see live witnesses.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:10.000
Todorov tells us that, in a tenth of a second,

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:13.000
we can make a judgment on somebody's face.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:16.000
Are we uncomfortable with this image? Yes, we are.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:19.000
Would we be happy if our doctor's face, our lawyer's face,

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.000
our financial adviser's face was covered?

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.000
We'd be pretty uncomfortable.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.000
But are we good at making the judgments

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:28.000
on facial appearance and movement?

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.000
The truth is that there's a five-minute rule,

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:33.000
not the tenth-of-a-second rule like Todorov, but a five-minute rule.

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.000
If you spend five minutes with somebody,

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:37.000
you start looking beyond their facial appearance,

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.000
and the people who you're initially attracted to

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.000
may seem boring and you lose interest in them,

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:43.000
and the people who you didn't immediately seek out,

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.000
because you didn't find them particularly attractive,

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:47.000
become attractive people

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.000
because of their personality.

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:53.000
So we've talked a lot about facial appearance.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.000
I now want to share

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:57.000
a little bit of the surgery that we do --

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.000
where we're at and where we're going.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.000
This is an image of Ann

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.000
who's had her right jaw removed and the base of her skull removed.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:05.000
And you can see in the images afterward,

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:07.000
we've managed to reconstruct her successfully.

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:09.000
But that's not good enough.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:11.000
This is what Ann wants. She wants to be out kayaking,

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.000
she wants to be out climbing mountains.

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:15.000
And that's what she achieved, and that's what we have to get to.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:17.000
This is a horrific image,

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:19.000
so I'm putting my hand up now.

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:21.000
This is a photograph of Adi,

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:23.000
a Nigerian bank manager who had his face shot off

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:25.000
in an armed robbery.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.000
And he lost his lower jaw, his lip, his chin

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:29.000
and his upper jaw and teeth.

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:31.000
This is the bar that he set for us.

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:34.000
"I want to look like this. This is how I looked before."

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.000
So with modern technology,

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:39.000
we used computers to make models.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:41.000
We made a model of the jaw without bone in it.

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.000
We then bent a plate up to it.

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:45.000
We put it in place

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:47.000
so we knew it was an accurate position.

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:50.000
We then put bone and tissue from the back.

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:52.000
Here you can see the plate holding it,

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:55.000
and you can see the implants being put in --

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.000
so that in one operation

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:00.000
we achieve this

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.000
and this.

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:04.000
So the patient's life is restored.

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:06.000
That's the good news.

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.000
However, his chin skin

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:10.000
doesn't look the same as it did before.

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.000
It's skin from his back.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:15.000
It's thicker, it's darker, it's coarser, it doesn't have the contours.

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:17.000
And that's where we're failing,

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:19.000
and that's where we need the face transplant.

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:21.000
The face transplant has a role

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:24.000
probably in burns patients to replace the skin.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.000
We can replace the underlying skeletal structure,

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:29.000
but we're still not good at replacing the facial skin.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:31.000
So it's very valuable

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.000
to have that tool in our armamentarium.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:35.000
But the patients are going to have to take drugs

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:37.000
that suppress their immune system for the rest of their lives.

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:39.000
What does that mean?

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:42.000
They have an increased risk of infection, an increased risk of malignancy.

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.000
This is not a life-saving transplant --

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:47.000
like a heart, or liver, or lung transplant --

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:50.000
it is a quality-of-life transplant,

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.000
and as a result,

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:55.000
are the patients going to say, if they get a malignant cancer 10 or 15 years on,

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:58.000
"I wish I'd had conventional reconstructive techniques rather than this

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:01.000
because I'm now dying of a malignant cancer"? We don't know yet.

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:04.000
We also don't know what they feel

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:06.000
about recognition and identity.

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:09.000
Bernard Devauchelle and Sylvie Testelin, who did the first operation,

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:11.000
are studying that.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:14.000
Donors are going to be short on the ground,

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:17.000
because how many people want to have their loved one's face

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:20.000
removed at the point of death?

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:22.000
So there are going to be problems

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:24.000
with face transplantation.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.000
So the better news is

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.000
the future's almost here --

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.000
and the future is tissue engineering.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.000
Just imagine,

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:35.000
I can make a biologically-degradable template.

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:37.000
I can put it in place where it's meant to be.

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.000
I can sprinkle a few cells,

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:41.000
stem cells from the patient's own hip,

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:43.000
a little bit of genetically engineered protein,

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:47.000
and lo and behold, leave it for four months and the face is grown.

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:50.000
This is a bit like a Julia Child recipe.

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:53.000
But we've still got problems.

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:55.000
We've got mouth cancer to solve.

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:58.000
We're still not curing enough patients -- it's the most disfiguring cancer.

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:01.000
We're still not reconstructing them well enough.

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.000
In the U.K. we have an epidemic

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:05.000
of facial injuries among young people.

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:07.000
We still can't get rid of scars.

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:09.000
We need to do research.

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:11.000
And the best news of all

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:13.000
is that surgeons know

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:15.000
that we need to do research.

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:17.000
And we've set up charities

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:19.000
that will help us fund

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:21.000
the clinical research

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:23.000
to determine the best treatment practice now

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:25.000
and better treatment into the future,

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:27.000
so we don't just sit on our laurels and say, "Okay, we're doing okay.

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:29.000
Let's leave it as it is."

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:31.000
Thank you very much indeed.

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:33.000
(Applause)
