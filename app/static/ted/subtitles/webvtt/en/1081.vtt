WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
As a child,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
I was raised by native Hawaiian elders --

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
three old women

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
who took care of me while my parents worked.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
The year is 1963.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
We're at the ocean.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
It's twilight.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
We're watching the rising of the stars

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
and the shifting of the tides.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
It's a stretch of beach we know so well.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
The smooth stones on the sand

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
are familiar to us.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
If you saw these women on the street

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
in their faded clothes,

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
you might dismiss them

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
as poor and simple.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
That would be a mistake.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
These women are descendants

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
of Polynesian navigators,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
trained in the old ways

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
by their elders,

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
and now they're passing it on to me.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
They teach me the names of the winds and the rains,

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
of astronomy according to a genealogy of stars.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
There's a new moon on the horizon.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
Hawaiians say it's a good night for fishing.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
They begin to chant.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:47.000
[Hawaiian chant]

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
When they finish,

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
they sit in a circle

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
and ask me to come to join them.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
They want to teach me about my destiny.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
I thought every seven-year-old went through this.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
(Laughter)

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
"Baby girl,

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
someday the world will be in trouble.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
People will forget their wisdom.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
It will take elders' voices

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
from the far corners of the world

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
to call the world into balance.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
You will go far away.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
It will sometimes be a lonely road.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
We will not be there.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
But you will look into the eyes

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000
of seeming strangers,

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000
and you will recognize your ohana,

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
your family.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
And it will take all of you.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.000
It will take all of you."

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000
These words, I hold onto

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
all my life.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
Because the idea of doing it alone

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
terrifies me.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
The year is 2007.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
I'm on a remote island in Micronesia.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000
Satawal is one half-mile long

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
by one mile wide.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
It's the home of my mentor.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000
His name is Pius Mau Piailug.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
Mau is a palu,

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
a navigator priest.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
He's also considered

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000
the greatest wave finder in the world.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
There are fewer than a handful

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000
of palu left on this island.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
Their tradition is so extraordinary

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
that these mariners sailed

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000
three million square miles across the Pacific

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000
without the use of instruments.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.000
They could synthesize patterns in nature

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.000
using the rising and setting of stars,

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000
the sequence and direction of waves,

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.000
the flight patterns of certain birds.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.000
Even the slightest hint of color

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000
on the underbelly of a cloud

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000
would inform them

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
and help them navigate with the keenest accuracy.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000
When Western scientists would join Mau on the canoe

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000
and watch him go into the hull,

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000
it appeared that an old man

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000
was going to rest.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000
In fact, the hull of the canoe

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000
is the womb of the vessel.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.000
It is the most accurate place

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.000
to feel the rhythm and sequence

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000
and direction of waves.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000
Mau was, in fact,

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
gathering explicit data

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000
using his entire body.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000
It's what he had been trained to do

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000
since he was five years old.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.000
Now science may dismiss this methodology,

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.000
but Polynesian navigators use it today

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.000
because it provides them

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000
an accurate determination

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000
of the angle and direction

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000
of their vessel.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000
The palu also had

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000
an uncanny ability

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000
to forecast weather conditions

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000
days in advance.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.000
Sometimes I'd be with Mau on a cloud-covered night

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.000
and we'd sit at the easternmost coast of the island,

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.000
and he would look out,

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000
and then he would say,

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000
"Okay, we go."

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000
He saw that first glint of light --

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.000
he knew what the weather was going to be three days from now.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.000
Their achievements, intellectually and scientifically,

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000
are extraordinary,

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000
and they are so relevant

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000
for these times that we are in

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:33.000
when we are riding out storms.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.000
We are in such a critical moment

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.000
of our collective history.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000
They have been compared

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000
to astronauts --

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000
these elder navigators

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.000
who sail vast open oceans

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.000
in double-hulled canoes

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.000
thousands of miles

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000
from a small island.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.000
Their canoes, our rockets;

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.000
their sea, our space.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000
The wisdom of these elders

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.000
is not a mere collection

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.000
of stories about old people

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000
in some remote spot.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.000
This is part of our collective narrative.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.000
It's humanity's DNA.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.000
We cannot afford to lose it.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.000
The year is 2010.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.000
Just as the women in Hawaii

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000
that raised me predicted,

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.000
the world is in trouble.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.000
We live in a society

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.000
bloated with data,

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.000
yet starved for wisdom.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:49.000
We're connected 24/7,

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000
yet anxiety,

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.000
fear, depression and loneliness

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000
is at an all-time high.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.000
We must course-correct.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.000
An African shaman said,

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.000
"Your society worships the jester

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.000
while the king stands

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:11.000
in plain clothes."

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.000
The link between the past and the future

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.000
is fragile.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.000
This I know intimately,

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:25.000
because even as I travel

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.000
throughout the world

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:31.000
to listen to these stories and record them,

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.000
I struggle.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:41.000
I am haunted

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:45.000
by the fact that I no longer remember

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:50.000
the names of the winds and the rains.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.000
Mau passed away

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.000
five months ago,

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:02.000
but his legacy and lessons live on.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:07.000
And I am reminded

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:10.000
that throughout the world

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000
there are cultures

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:16.000
with vast sums of knowledge in them,

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:20.000
as potent as the Micronesian navigators,

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.000
that are going dismissed,

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.000
that this is a testament

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000
to brilliant, brilliant

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:29.000
technology and science and wisdom

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000
that is vanishing rapidly.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:34.000
Because when an elder dies a library is burned,

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:38.000
and throughout the world, libraries are ablaze.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:41.000
I am grateful for the fact

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:44.000
that I had a mentor like Mau

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:47.000
who taught me how to navigate.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.000
And I realize

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:52.000
through a lesson that he shared

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.000
that we continue to find our way.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:57.000
And this is what he said:

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.000
"The island is the canoe;

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:02.000
the canoe, the island."

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:05.000
And what he meant was,

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.000
if you are voyaging

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.000
and far from home,

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.000
your very survival depends

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:14.000
on everyone aboard.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:17.000
You cannot make the voyage alone,

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.000
you were never meant to.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.000
This whole notion of every man for himself

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.000
is completely unsustainable.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:26.000
It always was.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:30.000
So in closing I would offer you this:

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:34.000
The planet is our canoe,

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:37.000
and we are the voyagers.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.000
True navigation

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:42.000
begins in the human heart.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.000
It's the most important map of all.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:48.000
Together, may we journey well.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:51.000
(Applause)
