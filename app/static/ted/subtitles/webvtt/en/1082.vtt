00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
I admit that I'm a little bit nervous here

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
because I'm going to say some radical things,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
about how we should think about cancer differently,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
to an audience that contains a lot of people

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
who know a lot more about cancer than I do.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
But I will also contest that I'm not as nervous as I should be

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
because I'm pretty sure I'm right about this.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
(Laughter)

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
And that this, in fact, will be

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
the way that we treat cancer in the future.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
In order to talk about cancer,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
I'm going to actually have to --

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
let me get the big slide here.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
First, I'm going to try to give you a different perspective of genomics.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
I want to put it in perspective of the bigger picture

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
of all the other things that are going on --

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
and then talk about something you haven't heard so much about, which is proteomics.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
Having explained those,

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
that will set up for what I think will be a different idea

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
about how to go about treating cancer.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
So let me start with genomics.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
It is the hot topic.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
It is the place where we're learning the most.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
This is the great frontier.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
But it has its limitations.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
And in particular, you've probably all heard the analogy

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
that the genome is like the blueprint of your body,

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
and if that were only true, it would be great,

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
but it's not.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
It's like the parts list of your body.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
It doesn't say how things are connected,

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
what causes what and so on.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
So if I can make an analogy,

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
let's say that you were trying to tell the difference

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
between a good restaurant, a healthy restaurant

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
and a sick restaurant,

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
and all you had was the list of ingredients

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
that they had in their larder.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
So it might be that, if you went to a French restaurant

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
and you looked through it and you found

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
they only had margarine and they didn't have butter,

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
you could say, "Ah, I see what's wrong with them.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
I can make them healthy."

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
And there probably are special cases of that.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
You could certainly tell the difference

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
between a Chinese restaurant and a French restaurant

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
by what they had in a larder.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
So the list of ingredients does tell you something,

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
and sometimes it tells you something that's wrong.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
If they have tons of salt,

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
you might guess they're using too much salt, or something like that.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
But it's limited,

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
because really to know if it's a healthy restaurant,

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000
you need to taste the food, you need to know what goes on in the kitchen,

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000
you need the product of all of those ingredients.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
So if I look at a person

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
and I look at a person's genome, it's the same thing.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
The part of the genome that we can read

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
is the list of ingredients.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
And so indeed,

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
there are times when we can find ingredients

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
that [are] bad.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
Cystic fibrosis is an example of a disease

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
where you just have a bad ingredient and you have a disease,

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
and we can actually make a direct correspondence

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
between the ingredient and the disease.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000
But most things, you really have to know what's going on in the kitchen,

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
because, mostly, sick people used to be healthy people --

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000
they have the same genome.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
So the genome really tells you much more

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
about predisposition.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
So what you can tell

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
is you can tell the difference between an Asian person and a European person

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
by looking at their ingredients list.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000
But you really for the most part can't tell the difference

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000
between a healthy person and a sick person --

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
except in some of these special cases.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000
So why all the big deal

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
about genetics?

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
Well first of all,

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000
it's because we can read it, which is fantastic.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000
It is very useful in certain circumstances.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.000
It's also the great theoretical triumph

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
of biology.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000
It's the one theory

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
that the biologists ever really got right.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000
It's fundamental to Darwin

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000
and Mendel and so on.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000
And so it's the one thing where they predicted a theoretical construct.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000
So Mendel had this idea of a gene

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.000
as an abstract thing,

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000
and Darwin built a whole theory

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000
that depended on them existing,

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000
and then Watson and Crick

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000
actually looked and found one.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000
So this happens in physics all the time.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000
You predict a black hole,

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.000
and you look out the telescope and there it is, just like you said.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
But it rarely happens in biology.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.000
So this great triumph -- it's so good,

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000
there's almost a religious experience

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000
in biology.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000
And Darwinian evolution

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.000
is really the core theory.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000
So the other reason it's been very popular

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.000
is because we can measure it, it's digital.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000
And in fact,

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000
thanks to Kary Mullis,

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.000
you can basically measure your genome in your kitchen

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000
with a few extra ingredients.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.000
So for instance, by measuring the genome,

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.000
we've learned a lot about how we're related to other kinds of animals

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.000
by the closeness of our genome,

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.000
or how we're related to each other -- the family tree,

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000
or the tree of life.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.000
There's a huge amount of information about the genetics

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.000
just by comparing the genetic similarity.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000
Now of course, in medical application,

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000
that is very useful

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.000
because it's the same kind of information

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.000
that the doctor gets from your family medical history --

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000
except probably,

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.000
your genome knows much more about your medical history than you do.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000
And so by reading the genome,

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.000
we can find out much more about your family than you probably know.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000
And so we can discover things

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000
that probably you could have found

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000
by looking at enough of your relatives,

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.000
but they may be surprising.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000
I did the 23andMe thing

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.000
and was very surprised to discover that I am fat and bald.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:33.000
(Laughter)

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.000
But sometimes you can learn much more useful things about that.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.000
But mostly

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000
what you need to know, to find out if you're sick,

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000
is not your predispositions,

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.000
but it's actually what's going on in your body right now.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.000
So to do that, what you really need to do,

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000
you need to look at the things

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000
that the genes are producing

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.000
and what's happening after the genetics,

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000
and that's what proteomics is about.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.000
Just like genome mixes the study of all the genes,

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.000
proteomics is the study of all the proteins.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.000
And the proteins are all of the little things in your body

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.000
that are signaling between the cells --

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.000
actually, the machines that are operating --

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.000
that's where the action is.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.000
Basically, a human body

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.000
is a conversation going on,

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.000
both within the cells and between the cells,

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.000
and they're telling each other to grow and to die,

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.000
and when you're sick,

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000
something's gone wrong with that conversation.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000
And so the trick is --

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.000
unfortunately, we don't have an easy way to measure these

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000
like we can measure the genome.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.000
So the problem is that measuring --

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:40.000
if you try to measure all the proteins, it's a very elaborate process.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000
It requires hundreds of steps,

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000
and it takes a long, long time.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.000
And it matters how much of the protein it is.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:49.000
It could be very significant that a protein changed by 10 percent,

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:52.000
so it's not a nice digital thing like DNA.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000
And basically our problem is somebody's in the middle

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000
of this very long stage,

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.000
they pause for just a moment,

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000
and they leave something in an enzyme for a second,

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000
and all of a sudden all the measurements from then on

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000
don't work.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.000
And so then people get very inconsistent results

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.000
when they do it this way.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.000
People have tried very hard to do this.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.000
I tried this a couple of times

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.000
and looked at this problem and gave up on it.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.000
I kept getting this call from this oncologist

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.000
named David Agus.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.000
And Applied Minds gets a lot of calls

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.000
from people who want help with their problems,

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:26.000
and I didn't think this was a very likely one to call back,

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.000
so I kept on giving him to the delay list.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000
And then one day,

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.000
I get a call from John Doerr, Bill Berkman

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.000
and Al Gore on the same day

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.000
saying return David Agus's phone call.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.000
(Laughter)

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.000
So I was like, "Okay. This guy's at least resourceful."

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:45.000
(Laughter)

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.000
So we started talking,

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:50.000
and he said, "I really need a better way to measure proteins."

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000
I'm like, "Looked at that. Been there.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000
Not going to be easy."

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.000
He's like, "No, no. I really need it.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:00.000
I mean, I see patients dying every day

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.000
because we don't know what's going on inside of them.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.000
We have to have a window into this."

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.000
And he took me through

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:10.000
specific examples of when he really needed it.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000
And I realized, wow, this would really make a big difference,

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.000
if we could do it,

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.000
and so I said, "Well, let's look at it."

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.000
Applied Minds has enough play money

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.000
that we can go and just work on something

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:23.000
without getting anybody's funding or permission or anything.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.000
So we started playing around with this.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:28.000
And as we did it, we realized this was the basic problem --

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.000
that taking the sip of coffee --

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000
that there were humans doing this complicated process

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.000
and that what really needed to be done

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:37.000
was to automate this process like an assembly line

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.000
and build robots

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.000
that would measure proteomics.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.000
And so we did that,

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.000
and working with David,

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:48.000
we made a little company called Applied Proteomics eventually,

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.000
which makes this robotic assembly line,

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:54.000
which, in a very consistent way, measures the protein.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:57.000
And I'll show you what that protein measurement looks like.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.000
Basically, what we do

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000
is we take a drop of blood

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000
out of a patient,

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.000
and we sort out the proteins

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.000
in the drop of blood

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.000
according to how much they weigh,

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.000
how slippery they are,

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.000
and we arrange them in an image.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.000
And so we can look at literally

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.000
hundreds of thousands of features at once

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.000
out of that drop of blood.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.000
And we can take a different one tomorrow,

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.000
and you will see your proteins tomorrow will be different --

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:28.000
they'll be different after you eat or after you sleep.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:31.000
They really tell us what's going on there.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.000
And so this picture,

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.000
which looks like a big smudge to you,

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:39.000
is actually the thing that got me really thrilled about this

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.000
and made me feel like we were on the right track.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.000
So if I zoom into that picture,

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.000
I can just show you what it means.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:48.000
We sort out the proteins -- from left to right

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:51.000
is the weight of the fragments that we're getting,

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:54.000
and from top to bottom is how slippery they are.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:57.000
So we're zooming in here just to show you a little bit of it.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.000
And so each of these lines

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:02.000
represents some signal that we're getting out of a piece of a protein.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.000
And you can see how the lines occur

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:08.000
in these little groups of bump, bump, bump, bump, bump.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:11.000
And that's because we're measuring the weight so precisely that --

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.000
carbon comes in different isotopes,

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:16.000
so if it has an extra neutron on it,

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:20.000
we actually measure it as a different chemical.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:23.000
So we're actually measuring each isotope as a different one.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:26.000
And so that gives you an idea

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.000
of how exquisitely sensitive this is.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.000
So seeing this picture

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.000
is sort of like getting to be Galileo

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.000
and looking at the stars

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.000
and looking through the telescope for the first time,

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:39.000
and suddenly you say, "Wow, it's way more complicated than we thought it was."

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.000
But we can see that stuff out there

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.000
and actually see features of it.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:46.000
So this is the signature out of which we're trying to get patterns.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.000
So what we do with this

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.000
is, for example, we can look at two patients,

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:53.000
one that responded to a drug and one that didn't respond to a drug,

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.000
and ask, "What's going on differently

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.000
inside of them?"

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:00.000
And so we can make these measurements precisely enough

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:03.000
that we can overlay two patients and look at the differences.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:05.000
So here we have Alice in green

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:07.000
and Bob in red.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:10.000
We overlay them. This is actual data.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:13.000
And you can see, mostly it overlaps and it's yellow,

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.000
but there's some things that just Alice has

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.000
and some things that just Bob has.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:20.000
And if we find a pattern of things

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:23.000
of the responders to the drug,

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.000
we see that in the blood,

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.000
they have the condition

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.000
that allows them to respond to this drug.

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.000
We might not even know what this protein is,

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:33.000
but we can see it's a marker

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.000
for the response to the disease.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.000
So this already, I think,

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:43.000
is tremendously useful in all kinds of medicine.

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.000
But I think this is actually

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:47.000
just the beginning

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.000
of how we're going to treat cancer.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.000
So let me move to cancer.

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.000
The thing about cancer --

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.000
when I got into this,

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:57.000
I really knew nothing about it,

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.000
but working with David Agus,

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:02.000
I started watching how cancer was actually being treated

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:05.000
and went to operations where it was being cut out.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:07.000
And as I looked at it,

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:09.000
to me it didn't make sense

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:11.000
how we were approaching cancer,

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:14.000
and in order to make sense of it,

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:17.000
I had to learn where did this come from.

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:21.000
We're treating cancer almost like it's an infectious disease.

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:23.000
We're treating it as something that got inside of you

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:25.000
that we have to kill.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.000
So this is the great paradigm.

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:29.000
This is another case

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:31.000
where a theoretical paradigm in biology really worked --

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:34.000
was the germ theory of disease.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.000
So what doctors are mostly trained to do

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.000
is diagnose --

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.000
that is, put you into a category

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:42.000
and apply a scientifically proven treatment

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:44.000
for that diagnosis --

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:47.000
and that works great for infectious diseases.

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:49.000
So if we put you in the category

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:52.000
of you've got syphilis, we can give you penicillin.

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.000
We know that that works.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.000
If you've got malaria, we give you quinine

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.000
or some derivative of it.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:01.000
And so that's the basic thing doctors are trained to do,

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:03.000
and it's miraculous

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:06.000
in the case of infectious disease --

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.000
how well it works.

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:11.000
And many people in this audience probably wouldn't be alive

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:13.000
if doctors didn't do this.

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:15.000
But now let's apply that

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:17.000
to systems diseases like cancer.

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:19.000
The problem is that, in cancer,

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:21.000
there isn't something else

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.000
that's inside of you.

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:25.000
It's you; you're broken.

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:29.000
That conversation inside of you

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:31.000
got mixed up in some way.

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.000
So how do we diagnose that conversation?

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:36.000
Well, right now what we do is we divide it by part of the body --

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:39.000
you know, where did it appear? --

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:41.000
and we put you in different categories

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:43.000
according to the part of the body.

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:45.000
And then we do a clinical trial

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.000
for a drug for lung cancer

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:50.000
and one for prostate cancer and one for breast cancer,

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:53.000
and we treat these as if they're separate diseases

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.000
and that this way of dividing them

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.000
had something to do with what actually went wrong.

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:59.000
And of course, it really doesn't have that much to do

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:01.000
with what went wrong

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:04.000
because cancer is a failure of the system.

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:06.000
And in fact, I think we're even wrong

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:09.000
when we talk about cancer as a thing.

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:11.000
I think this is the big mistake.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:15.000
I think cancer should not be a noun.

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:17.000
We should talk about cancering

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:20.000
as something we do, not something we have.

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:22.000
And so those tumors,

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:24.000
those are symptoms of cancer.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:27.000
And so your body is probably cancering all the time,

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:30.000
but there are lots of systems in your body

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.000
that keep it under control.

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.000
And so to give you an idea

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:36.000
of an analogy of what I mean

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:39.000
by thinking of cancering as a verb,

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:42.000
imagine we didn't know anything about plumbing,

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:44.000
and the way that we talked about it,

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:47.000
we'd come home and we'd find a leak in our kitchen

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:51.000
and we'd say, "Oh, my house has water."

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:54.000
We might divide it -- the plumber would say, "Well, where's the water?"

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:57.000
"Well, it's in the kitchen." "Oh, you must have kitchen water."

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:00.000
That's kind of the level at which it is.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.000
"Kitchen water,

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:04.000
well, first of all, we'll go in there and we'll mop out a lot of it.

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:07.000
And then we know that if we sprinkle Drano around the kitchen,

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:10.000
that helps.

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:12.000
Whereas living room water,

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:14.000
it's better to do tar on the roof."

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:16.000
And it sounds silly,

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:18.000
but that's basically what we do.

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:21.000
And I'm not saying you shouldn't mop up your water if you have cancer,

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:24.000
but I'm saying that's not really the problem;

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:26.000
that's the symptom of the problem.

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:28.000
What we really need to get at

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:30.000
is the process that's going on,

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:32.000
and that's happening at the level

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:34.000
of the proteonomic actions,

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:37.000
happening at the level of why is your body not healing itself

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:39.000
in the way that it normally does?

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:42.000
Because normally, your body is dealing with this problem all the time.

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:45.000
So your house is dealing with leaks all the time,

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:49.000
but it's fixing them. It's draining them out and so on.

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:52.000
So what we need

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:56.000
is to have a causative model

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:58.000
of what's actually going on,

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:01.000
and proteomics actually gives us

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:04.000
the ability to build a model like that.

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:06.000
David got me invited

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:08.000
to give a talk at National Cancer Institute

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:11.000
and Anna Barker was there.

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:14.000
And so I gave this talk

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:17.000
and said, "Why don't you guys do this?"

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:19.000
And Anna said,

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:22.000
"Because nobody within cancer

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:24.000
would look at it this way.

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:27.000
But what we're going to do, is we're going to create a program

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:29.000
for people outside the field of cancer

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:31.000
to get together with doctors

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:34.000
who really know about cancer

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:38.000
and work out different programs of research."

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:40.000
So David and I applied to this program

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:42.000
and created a consortium

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:44.000
at USC

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:47.000
where we've got some of the best oncologists in the world

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:50.000
and some of the best biologists in the world,

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:52.000
from Cold Spring Harbor,

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:54.000
Stanford, Austin --

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:57.000
I won't even go through and name all the places --

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:00.000
to have a research project

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:02.000
that will last for five years

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:05.000
where we're really going to try to build a model of cancer like this.

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:07.000
We're doing it in mice first,

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:09.000
and we will kill a lot of mice

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:11.000
in the process of doing this,

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:13.000
but they will die for a good cause.

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:16.000
And we will actually try to get to the point

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:18.000
where we have a predictive model

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:20.000
where we can understand,

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:22.000
when cancer happens,

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:24.000
what's actually happening in there

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:27.000
and which treatment will treat that cancer.

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:30.000
So let me just end with giving you a little picture

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:33.000
of what I think cancer treatment will be like in the future.

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:35.000
So I think eventually,

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:37.000
once we have one of these models for people,

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:39.000
which we'll get eventually --

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:41.000
I mean, our group won't get all the way there --

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:44.000
but eventually we'll have a very good computer model --

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:47.000
sort of like a global climate model for weather.

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:50.000
It has lots of different information

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:53.000
about what's the process going on in this proteomic conversation

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:55.000
on many different scales.

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:57.000
And so we will simulate

00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:59.000
in that model

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:02.000
for your particular cancer --

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:04.000
and this also will be for ALS,

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:07.000
or any kind of system neurodegenerative diseases,

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:09.000
things like that --

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:11.000
we will simulate

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:13.000
specifically you,

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:15.000
not just a generic person,

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:17.000
but what's actually going on inside you.

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:19.000
And in that simulation, what we could do

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:21.000
is design for you specifically

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:23.000
a sequence of treatments,

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:26.000
and it might be very gentle treatments, very small amounts of drugs.

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:29.000
It might be things like, don't eat that day,

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:31.000
or give them a little chemotherapy,

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:33.000
maybe a little radiation.

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:36.000
Of course, we'll do surgery sometimes and so on.

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:39.000
But design a program of treatments specifically for you

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:42.000
and help your body

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:45.000
guide back to health --

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:47.000
guide your body back to health.

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:51.000
Because your body will do most of the work of fixing it

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:54.000
if we just sort of prop it up in the ways that are wrong.

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:56.000
We put it in the equivalent of splints.

00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:58.000
And so your body basically has lots and lots of mechanisms

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:00.000
for fixing cancer,

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:03.000
and we just have to prop those up in the right way

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:05.000
and get them to do the job.

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:07.000
And so I believe that this will be the way

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:09.000
that cancer will be treated in the future.

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:11.000
It's going to require a lot of work,

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:13.000
a lot of research.

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:16.000
There will be many teams like our team

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:18.000
that work on this.

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:20.000
But I think eventually,

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:22.000
we will design for everybody

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:26.000
a custom treatment for cancer.

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:28.000
So thank you very much.

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:34.000
(Applause)
