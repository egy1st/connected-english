00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
Thank you so much.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000
We are so honored to be here at TEDWomen,

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000
sharing our music with you.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.000
What an exciting and inspiring event.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.000
What you just heard is "Skylife" by David Balakrishnan.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.000
We want to play you one more selection.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.000
It's by Astor Piazzolla, an Argentine composer.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000
And we talk about different ideas --

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000
he had this idea

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.000
that he thought music should be from the heart.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
This was in the middle of the 20th century

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
when music from the heart, beautiful music,

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000
wasn't the most popular thing in the classical music world.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000
It was more atonal and twelve-tone.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.000
And he insisted on beautiful music.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000
So this is "Oblivion" by Astor Piazzolla.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000
Thank you.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:56.000
(Music)

00:08:44.000 --> 00:09:03.000
