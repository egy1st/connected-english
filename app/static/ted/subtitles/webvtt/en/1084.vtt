00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Ten years ago exactly,

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
I was in Afghanistan.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
I was covering the war in Afghanistan,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
and I witnessed, as a reporter for Al Jazeera,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
the amount of suffering and destruction

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
that emerged out of a war like that.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Then, two years later,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
I covered another war -- the war in Iraq.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
I was placed at the center of that war

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
because I was covering the war

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
from the northern part of Iraq.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
And the war ended

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
with a regime change,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
like the one in Afghanistan.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
And that regime

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
that we got rid of

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
was actually a dictatorship,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
an authoritarian regime,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
that for decades

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000
created a great sense of paralysis

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
within the nation, within the people themselves.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
However,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
the change that came through foreign intervention

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
created even worse circumstances for the people

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
and deepened the sense

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
of paralysis and inferiority

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
in that part of the world.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
For decades,

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
we have lived under authoritarian regimes --

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
in the Arab world, in the Middle East.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
These regimes

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
created something within us during this period.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
I'm 43 years old right now.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
For the last 40 years,

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
I have seen almost the same faces

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000
for kings and presidents ruling us --

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.000
old, aged, authoritarian,

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
corrupt situations --

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
regimes that we have seen around us.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
And for a moment I was wondering,

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
are we going to live in order to see

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
real change happening on the ground,

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
a change that does not come through foreign intervention,

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
through the misery of occupation,

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
through nations invading our land

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000
and deepening the sense of inferiority sometimes?

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
The Iraqis: yes, they got rid of Saddam Hussein,

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
but when they saw

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000
their land occupied by foreign forces

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
they felt very sad,

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
they felt that their dignity had suffered.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
And this is why they revolted.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
This is why they did not accept.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
And actually other regimes, they told their citizens,

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
"Would you like to see the situation of Iraq?

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
Would you like to see civil war, sectarian killing?

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
Would you like to see destruction?

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
Would you like to see foreign troops on your land?"

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
And the people thought for themselves,

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
"Maybe we should live with

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
this kind of authoritarian situation that we find ourselves in,

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
instead of having the second scenario."

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000
That was one of the worst nightmares that we have seen.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
For 10 years,

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
unfortunately we have found ourselves

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000
reporting images of destruction,

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
images of killing,

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
of sectarian conflicts,

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
images of violence,

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000
emerging from a magnificent piece of land,

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
a region that one day was the source

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000
of civilizations and art and culture

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000
for thousands of years.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000
Now I am here to tell you

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
that the future

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
that we were dreaming for

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000
has eventually arrived.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000
A new generation,

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000
well-educated,

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
connected,

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.000
inspired by universal values

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.000
and a global understanding,

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.000
has created a new reality for us.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.000
We have found a new way

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.000
to express our feelings

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000
and to express our dreams:

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000
these young people

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000
who have restored self-confidence

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000
in our nations in that part of the world,

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000
who have given us

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.000
new meaning for freedom

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.000
and empowered us to go down to the streets.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000
Nothing happened. No violence. Nothing.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000
Just step out of your house,

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000
raise your voice

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.000
and say, "We would like to see the end of the regime."

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000
This is what happened in Tunisia.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000
Over a few days,

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.000
the Tunisian regime that invested billions of dollars

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000
in the security agencies,

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000
billions of dollars

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.000
in maintaining, trying to maintain,

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000
its prisons,

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000
collapsed, disappeared,

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.000
because of the voices of the public.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000
People who were inspired to go down to the streets

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000
and to raise their voices,

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000
they tried to kill.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.000
The intelligence agencies wanted to arrest people.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.000
They found something called Facebook.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000
They found something called Twitter.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000
They were surprised by all of these kinds of issues.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000
And they said,

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.000
"These kids are misled."

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000
Therefore, they asked their parents

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000
to go down to the streets

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000
and collect them, bring them back home.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000
This is what they were telling. This is their propaganda.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000
"Bring these kids home

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000
because they are misled."

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000
But yes,

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000
these youth

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000
who have been inspired

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000
by universal values,

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000
who are idealistic enough

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000
to imagine a magnificent future

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.000
and, at the same time, realistic enough

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.000
to balance this kind of imagination

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.000
and the process leading to it --

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000
not using violence,

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000
not trying to create chaos --

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000
these young people,

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.000
they did not go home.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000
Parents actually went to the streets

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.000
and they supported them.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.000
And this is how the revolution was born in Tunisia.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000
We in Al Jazeera

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.000
were banned from Tunisia for years,

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.000
and the government did not allow

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000
any Al Jazeera reporter to be there.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.000
But we found that these people in the street,

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.000
all of them are our reporters,

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000
feeding our newsroom

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.000
with pictures, with videos

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000
and with news.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.000
And suddenly that newsroom in Doha

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.000
became a center

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.000
that received all this kind of input from ordinary people --

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.000
people who are connected and people who have ambition

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000
and who have liberated themselves

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.000
from the feeling of inferiority.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.000
And then we took that decision:

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.000
We are unrolling the news.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.000
We are going to be the voice for these voiceless people.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000
We are going to spread the message.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000
Yes, some of these young people

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000
are connected to the Internet,

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000
but the connectivity in the Arab world

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000
is very little, is very small,

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.000
because of many problems that we are suffering from.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:40.000
But Al Jazeera took the voice from these people

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000
and we amplified [it].

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.000
We put it in every sitting room in the Arab world --

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000
and internationally, globally,

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000
through our English channel.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:52.000
And then people started to feel

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:55.000
that there's something new happening.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.000
And then Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000
decided to leave.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000
And then Egypt started,

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000
and Hosni Mubarak decided to leave.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.000
And now Libya as you see it.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.000
And then you have Yemen.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.000
And you have many other countries trying to see

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.000
and to rediscover that feeling

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000
of, "How do we imagine a future

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.000
which is magnificent and peaceful and tolerant?"

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.000
I want to tell you something,

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:25.000
that the Internet and connectivity

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:28.000
has created [a] new mindset.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000
But this mindset

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000
has continued to be faithful

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.000
to the soil and to the land

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:37.000
that it emerged from.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:40.000
And while this was the major difference

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.000
between many initiatives before

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.000
to create change,

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.000
before we thought, and governments told us --

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:50.000
and even sometimes it was true --

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:53.000
that change was imposed on us,

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.000
and people rejected that,

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:58.000
because they thought that it is alien to their culture.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:01.000
Always, we believed

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:04.000
that change will spring from within,

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:08.000
that change should be a reconciliation

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:11.000
with culture, cultural diversity,

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.000
with our faith in our tradition

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.000
and in our history,

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.000
but at the same time,

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:20.000
open to universal values, connected with the world,

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.000
tolerant to the outside.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.000
And this is the moment

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000
that is happening right now in the Arab world.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:29.000
This is the right moment, and this is the actual moment

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000
that we see all of these meanings meet together

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.000
and then create the beginning

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.000
of this magnificent era

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:38.000
that will emerge from the region.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.000
How did the elite deal with that --

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:44.000
the so-called political elite?

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:47.000
In front of Facebook,

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:50.000
they brought the camels in Tahrir Square.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.000
In front of Al Jazeera,

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:56.000
they started creating tribalism.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.000
And then when they failed,

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:01.000
they started speaking about conspiracies

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:04.000
that emerged from Tel Aviv and Washington

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:07.000
in order to divide the Arab world.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.000
They started telling the West,

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.000
"Be aware of Al-Qaeda.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.000
Al-Qaeda is taking over our territories.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.000
These are Islamists

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.000
trying to create new Imaras.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.000
Be aware of these people

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:22.000
who [are] coming to you

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:25.000
in order to ruin your great civilization."

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:28.000
Fortunately,

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.000
people right now cannot be deceived.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:33.000
Because this corrupt elite

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.000
in that region

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:39.000
has lost even the power of deception.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.000
They could not, and they cannot, imagine

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:44.000
how they could really deal with this reality.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.000
They have lost.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.000
They have been detached

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:51.000
from their people, from the masses,

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:54.000
and now we are seeing them collapsing

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.000
one after the other.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:00.000
Al Jazeera is not

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.000
a tool of revolution.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.000
We do not create revolutions.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.000
However,

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:09.000
when something of that magnitude happens,

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:12.000
we are at the center of the coverage.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.000
We were banned from Egypt,

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.000
and our correspondents,

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:19.000
some of them were arrested.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:22.000
But most of our camera people

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.000
and our journalists,

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:27.000
they went underground in Egypt -- voluntarily --

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:30.000
to report what happened in Tahrir Square.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.000
For 18 days,

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:35.000
our cameras were broadcasting, live,

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:38.000
the voices of the people in Tahrir Square.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.000
I remember one night

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.000
when someone phoned me on my cellphone --

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.000
ordinary person who I don't know -- from Tahrir Square.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.000
He told me, "We appeal to you

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.000
not to switch off the cameras.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.000
If you switch off the cameras tonight,

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.000
there will be a genocide.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:54.000
You are protecting us

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:57.000
by showing what is happening at Tahrir Square."

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.000
I felt the responsibility

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.000
to phone our correspondents there

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:03.000
and to phone our newsroom

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:05.000
and to tell them, "Make your best

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:07.000
not to switch off the cameras at night,

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:10.000
because the guys there really feel confident

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.000
when someone is reporting their story --

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:15.000
and they feel protected as well."

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:18.000
So we have a chance

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.000
to create a new future

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.000
in that part of the world.

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:25.000
We have a chance

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:28.000
to go and to think of the future

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:31.000
as something which is open to the world.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:34.000
Let us not repeat the mistake of Iran,

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.000
of [the] Mosaddeq revolution.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:39.000
Let us free ourselves -- especially in the West --

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.000
from thinking about that part of the world

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:44.000
based on oil interest,

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:47.000
or based on interests

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:50.000
of the illusion of stability and security.

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:53.000
The stability and security

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:56.000
of authoritarian regimes

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.000
cannot create

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.000
but terrorism and violence and destruction.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:03.000
Let us accept the choice of the people.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:05.000
Let us not pick and choose

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:08.000
who we would like to rule their future.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.000
The future should be ruled

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.000
by people themselves,

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.000
even sometimes if they are voices

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.000
that might now scare us.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:19.000
But the values of democracy

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:21.000
and the freedom of choice

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:24.000
that is sweeping the Middle East at this moment in time

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:26.000
is the best opportunity for the world,

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.000
for the West and the East,

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:31.000
to see stability and to see security

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:34.000
and to see friendship and to see tolerance

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.000
emerging from the Arab world,

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:39.000
rather than the images of violence and terrorism.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:41.000
Let us support these people.

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.000
Let us stand for them.

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:45.000
And let us give up

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:48.000
our narrow selfishness

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.000
in order to embrace change,

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:53.000
and in order to celebrate with the people of that region

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.000
a great future

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:58.000
and hope and tolerance.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.000
The future has arrived,

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.000
and the future is now.

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:04.000
I thank you very much.

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:17.000
(Applause)

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:19.000
Thank you very much.

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:24.000
(Applause)

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.000
Chris Anderson: I just have a couple of questions for you.

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:28.000
Thank you for coming here.

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.000
How would you characterize the historical significance

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.000
of what's happened?

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:35.000
Is this a story-of-the-year, a story-of-the-decade

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:37.000
or something more?

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:40.000
Wadah Khanfar: Actually, this may be the biggest story that we have ever covered.

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:42.000
We have covered many wars.

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.000
We have covered a lot of tragedies, a lot of problems,

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:47.000
a lot of conflict zones, a lot of hot spots in the region,

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:49.000
because we were centered at the middle of it.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:53.000
But this is a story -- it is a great story; it is beautiful.

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:56.000
It is not something that you only cover

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:59.000
because you have to cover a great incident.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:02.000
You are witnessing change in history.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:05.000
You are witnessing the birth of a new era.

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:07.000
And this is what the story's all about.

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:09.000
CA: There are a lot of people in the West

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:11.000
who are still skeptical,

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:14.000
or think this may just be an intermediate stage

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:17.000
before much more alarming chaos.

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:19.000
You really believe

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:22.000
that if there are democratic elections in Egypt now,

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:24.000
that a government could emerge

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:27.000
that espouses some of the values you've spoken about so inspiringly?

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:29.000
WK: And people actually,

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:32.000
after the collapse of the Hosni Mubarak regime,

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.000
the youth who have organized themselves

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:37.000
in certain groups and councils,

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:40.000
they are guarding the transformation

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.000
and they are trying to put it on a track

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:44.000
in order to satisfy

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.000
the values of democracy,

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.000
but at the same time

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:50.000
also to make it reasonable

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:52.000
and to make it rational,

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:55.000
not to go out of order.

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:58.000
In my opinion, these people are much more wiser

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:00.000
than, not only the political elite,

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:03.000
even the intellectual elite, even opposition leaders

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:05.000
including political parties.

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:08.000
At this moment in time, the youth in the Arab world

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:10.000
are much more wiser

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:12.000
and capable of creating the change

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:14.000
than the old --

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:16.000
including the political and cultural

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:18.000
and ideological

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.000
old regimes.

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:23.000
(Applause)

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:26.000
CA: We are not to get involved politically and interfere in that way.

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:29.000
What should people here at TED,

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:31.000
here in the West,

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:34.000
do if they want to connect or make a difference

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:36.000
and they believe in what's happening here?

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:38.000
WK: I think we have discovered a very important issue in the Arab world --

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:40.000
that people care,

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:43.000
people care about this great transformation.

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:45.000
Mohamed Nanabhay who's sitting with us,

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:48.000
the head of Aljazeera.net,

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:53.000
he told me that a 2,500 percent increase

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:55.000
of accessing our website

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:57.000
from various parts of the world.

00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:59.000
Fifty percent of it is coming from America.

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:01.000
Because we discovered that people care,

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:03.000
and people would like to know --

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:06.000
they are receiving the stream through our Internet.

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:08.000
Unfortunately in the United States,

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:11.000
we are not covering but Washington D.C. at this moment in time

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:13.000
for Al Jazeera English.

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:16.000
But I can tell you, this is the moment to celebrate

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:18.000
through connecting ourselves

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:20.000
with those people in the street

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:23.000
and expressing our support to them

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:27.000
and expressing this kind of feeling, universal feeling,

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:30.000
of supporting the weak and the oppressed

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:33.000
to create a much better future for all of us.

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:36.000
CA: Well Wadah, a group of members of the TED community,

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:38.000
TEDxCairo,

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:40.000
are meeting as we speak.

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:42.000
They've had some speakers there.

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:44.000
I believe they've heard your talk.

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:46.000
Thank you for inspiring them and for inspiring all of us.

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:48.000
Thank you so much.

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:51.000
(Applause)
