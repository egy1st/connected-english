00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Two weeks ago I was in my studio in Paris,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
and the phone rang and I heard,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
"Hey, JR,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
you won the TED Prize 2011.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
You have to make a wish to save the world."

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
I was lost.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
I mean, I can't save the world. Nobody can.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
The world is fucked up.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Come on, you have dictators ruling the world,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
population is growing by millions,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
there's no more fish in the sea,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
the North Pole is melting

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
and as the last TED Prize winner said,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
we're all becoming fat.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
(Laughter)

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
Except maybe French people.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
Whatever.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
So I called back

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
and I told her,

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
"Look, Amy,

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
tell the TED guys I just won't show up.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
I can't do anything to save the world."

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
She said, "Hey, JR,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
your wish is not to save the world, but to change the world."

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
"Oh, all right."

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
(Laughter)

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
"That's cool."

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
I mean, technology, politics, business

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
do change the world --

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
not always in a good way, but they do.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
What about art?

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
Could art change the world?

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
I started when I was 15 years old.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
And at that time, I was not thinking about changing the world.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
I was doing graffiti --

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
writing my name everywhere,

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
using the city as a canvas.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
I was going in the tunnels of Paris,

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
on the rooftops with my friends.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
Each trip was an excursion,

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
was an adventure.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
It was like leaving our mark on society,

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
to say, "I was here," on the top of a building.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
So when I found a cheap camera on the subway,

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.000
I started documenting those adventures with my friends

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
and gave them back as photocopies --

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000
really small photos just that size.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
That's how, at 17 years old,

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
I started pasting them.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
And I did my first "expo de rue,"

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
which means sidewalk gallery.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000
And I framed it with color

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000
so you would not confuse it with advertising.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000
I mean, the city's the best gallery I could imagine.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000
I would never have to make a book and then present it to a gallery

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
and let them decide

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
if my work was nice enough to show it to people.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
I would control it directly with the public

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
in the streets.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
So that's Paris.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
I would change --

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
depending on the places I would go --

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
the title of the exhibition.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
That's on the Champs-Elysees.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
I was quite proud of that one.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
Because I was just 18

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
and I was just up there on the top of the Champs-Elysees.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
Then when the photo left,

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
the frame was still there.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
(Laughter)

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
November 2005:

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
the streets are burning.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
A large wave of riots

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
had broken into the first projects of Paris.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000
Everyone was glued to the TV,

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.000
watching disturbing, frightening images

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000
taken from the edge of the neighborhood.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000
I mean, these kids, without control,

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
throwing Molotov cocktails,

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000
attacking the cops and the firemen,

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000
looting everything they could in the shops.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.000
These were criminals, thugs, dangerous,

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.000
destroying their own environment.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.000
And then I saw it -- could it be possible? --

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.000
my photo on a wall

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000
revealed by a burning car --

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000
a pasting I'd done a year earlier --

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.000
an illegal one -- still there.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000
I mean, these were the faces of my friends.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000
I know those guys.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000
All of them are not angels,

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.000
but they're not monsters either.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000
So it was kind of weird to see

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.000
those images and those eyes stare back at me through a television.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000
So I went back there

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000
with a 28 mm lens.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000
It was the only one I had at that time.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000
But with that lens,

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.000
you have to be as close as 10 inches from the person.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.000
So you can do it only with their trust.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:15.000
So I took full portraits of people from Le Bosquet.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000
They were making scary faces

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.000
to play the caricature of themselves.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.000
And then I pasted huge posters everywhere

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000
in the bourgeois area of Paris

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.000
with the name, age, even building number

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.000
of these guys.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000
A year later,

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000
the exhibition was displayed in front of the city hall of Paris.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000
And we go from thug images,

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000
who've been stolen and distorted by the media,

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000
who's now proudly taking over his own image.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000
That's where I realized

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.000
the power of paper and glue.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000
So could art change the world?

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000
A year later,

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000
I was listening to all the noise

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000
about the Middle East conflict.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000
I mean, at that time, trust me,

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000
they were only referring to the Israeli and Palestinian conflict.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000
So with my friend Marco,

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000
we decided to go there

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.000
and see who are the real Palestinians and who are the real Israelis.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000
Are they so different?

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.000
When we got there, we just went in the street,

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.000
started talking with people everywhere,

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000
and we realized that things were a bit different

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.000
from the rhetoric we heard in the media.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000
So we decided to take portraits

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000
of Palestinians and Israelis

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.000
doing the same jobs --

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.000
taxi-driver, lawyer, cooks.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.000
Asked them to make a face as a sign of commitment.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.000
Not a smile -- that really doesn't tell

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000
about who you are and what you feel.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000
They all accepted

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.000
to be pasted next to the other.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000
I decided to paste

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:16.000
in eight Israeli and Palestinian cities

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.000
and on both sides of the wall.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.000
We launched the biggest illegal art exhibition ever.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.000
We called the project Face 2 Face.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:28.000
The experts said, "No way.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.000
The people will not accept.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.000
The army will shoot you, and Hamas will kidnap you."

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.000
We said, "Okay, let's try and push as far as we can."

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000
I love the way that people will ask me,

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.000
"How big will my photo be?"

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.000
"It will be as big as your house."

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.000
When we did the wall, we did the Palestinian side.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000
So we arrived with just our ladders

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000
and we realized that they were not high enough.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000
And so Palestinians guys say,

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.000
"Calm down. No wait. I'm going to find you a solution."

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.000
So he went to the Church of Nativity

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000
and brought back an old ladder

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:04.000
that was so old that it could have seen Jesus being born.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.000
(Laughter)

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.000
We did Face 2 Face with only six friends,

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.000
two ladders, two brushes,

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.000
a rented car, a camera

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.000
and 20,000 square feet of paper.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.000
We had all sorts of help

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:22.000
from all walks of life.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.000
Okay, for example, that's Palestine.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.000
We're in Ramallah right now.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000
We're pasting portraits --

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000
so both portraits in the streets in a crowded market.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.000
People come around us and start asking,

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.000
"What are you doing here?"

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.000
"Oh, we're actually doing an art project

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.000
and we are pasting an Israeli and a Palestinian doing the same job.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:45.000
And those ones are actually two taxi-drivers."

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.000
And then there was always a silence.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:51.000
"You mean you're pasting an Israeli face --

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.000
doing a face -- right here?"

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:56.000
"Well, yeah, yeah, that's part of the project."

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.000
And I would always leave that moment,

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000
and we would ask them,

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.000
"So can you tell me who is who?"

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.000
And most of them couldn't say.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:11.000
(Applause)

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:14.000
We even pasted on Israeli military towers,

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.000
and nothing happened.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:19.000
When you paste an image, it's just paper and glue.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:22.000
People can tear it, tag on it, or even pee on it --

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.000
some are a bit high for that, I agree --

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000
but the people in the street,

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000
they are the curator.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.000
The rain and the wind will take them off anyway.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000
They are not meant to stay.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:35.000
But exactly four years after,

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:38.000
the photos, most of them are still there.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.000
Face 2 Face demonstrated

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:43.000
that what we thought impossible was possible --

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.000
and, you know what, even easy.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.000
We didn't push the limit;

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:50.000
we just showed that they were further than anyone thought.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.000
In the Middle East, I experienced my work

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.000
in places without [many] museums.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:59.000
So the reactions in the street

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.000
were kind of interesting.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.000
So I decided to go further in this direction

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:07.000
and go in places where there were zero museums.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.000
When you go in these developing societies,

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.000
women are the pillars of their community,

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:18.000
but the men are still the ones holding the streets.

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:21.000
So we were inspired to create a project

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:24.000
where men will pay tribute to women

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:27.000
by posting their photos.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:31.000
I called that project Women Are Heroes.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.000
When I listened to all the stories

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.000
everywhere I went on the continents,

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.000
I couldn't always understand

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:40.000
the complicated circumstances of their conflict.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:43.000
I just observed.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:46.000
Sometimes there was no words,

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:49.000
no sentence, just tears.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:52.000
I just took their pictures

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:55.000
and pasted them.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:59.000
Women Are Heroes took me around the world.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.000
Most of the places I went to,

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.000
I decided to go there

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.000
because I've heard about it through the media.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.000
So for example, in June 2008,

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.000
I was watching TV in Paris,

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.000
and then I heard about this terrible thing

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.000
that happened in Rio de Janeiro --

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:17.000
the first favela of Brazil named Providencia.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:20.000
Three kids -- that was three students --

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.000
were [detained] by the army

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.000
because they were not carrying their papers.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.000
And the army took them,

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:29.000
and instead of bringing them to the police station,

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:32.000
they brought them to an enemy favela

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.000
where they get chopped into pieces.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.000
I was shocked.

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.000
All Brazil was shocked.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:41.000
I heard it was one of the most violent favelas,

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:44.000
because the largest drug cartel controls it.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.000
So I decided to go there.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.000
When I arrived --

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:51.000
I mean, I didn't have any contact with any NGO.

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:54.000
There was none in place -- no association, no NGOs, nothing --

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.000
no eyewitnesses.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.000
So we just walked around,

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.000
and we met a woman,

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.000
and I showed her my book.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:04.000
And she said, "You know what?

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:06.000
We're hungry for culture.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:09.000
We need culture out there."

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:12.000
So I went out and I started with the kids.

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.000
I just took a few photos of the kids,

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:17.000
and the next day I came with the posters and we pasted them.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:20.000
The day after, I came back and they were already scratched.

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.000
But that's okay.

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:25.000
I wanted them to feel that this art belongs to them.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:29.000
Then the next day, I held a meeting on the main square

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.000
and some women came.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:35.000
They were all linked to the three kids that got killed.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:39.000
There was the mother, the grandmother, the best friend --

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:42.000
they all wanted to shout the story.

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.000
After that day,

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:48.000
everyone in the favela gave me the green light.

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:51.000
I took more photos, and we started the project.

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.000
The drug lords were kind of worried

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.000
about us filming in the place,

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:57.000
so I told them, "You know what?

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.000
I'm not interested in filming the violence and the weapons.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.000
You see that enough in the media.

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.000
What I want to show is the incredible life and energy.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:06.000
I've been seeing it around me the last few days."

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:09.000
So that's a really symbolic pasting,

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:12.000
because that's the first one we did that you couldn't see from the city.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:15.000
And that's where the three kids got arrested,

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:18.000
and that's the grandmother of one of them.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.000
And on that stairs,

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.000
that's where the traffickers always stand

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:24.000
and there's a lot of exchange of fire.

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:27.000
Everyone there understood the project.

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:31.000
And then we pasted everywhere -- the whole hill.

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:41.000
(Applause)

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.000
What was interesting is that the media couldn't get in.

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:45.000
I mean, you should see that.

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:48.000
They would have to film us from a really long distance by helicopter

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.000
and then have a really long lens,

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:52.000
and we would see ourselves, on TV, pasting.

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.000
And they would put a number: "Please call this number

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.000
if you know what's going on in Providencia."

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:59.000
We just did a project and then left

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.000
so the media wouldn't know.

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:03.000
So how can we know about the project?

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:06.000
So they had to go and find the women

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.000
and get an explanation from them.

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:11.000
So you create a bridge between the media

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:14.000
and the anonymous women.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.000
We kept traveling.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.000
We went to Africa, Sudan, Sierra Leone,

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:20.000
Liberia, Kenya.

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.000
In war-torn places like Monrovia,

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.000
people come straight to you.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.000
I mean, they want to know what you're up to.

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:29.000
They kept asking me, "What is the purpose of your project?

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:32.000
Are you an NGO? Are you the media?"

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:35.000
Art. Just doing art.

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:37.000
Some people question, "Why is it in black and white?

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:39.000
Don't you have color in France?"

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:41.000
(Laughter)

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:43.000
Or they tell you, "Are these people all dead?"

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:46.000
Some who understood the project would explain it to others.

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:49.000
And to a man who did not understand, I heard someone say,

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:52.000
"You know, you've been here for a few hours

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:55.000
trying to understand, discussing with your fellows.

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.000
During that time, you haven't thought about

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:59.000
what you're going to eat tomorrow.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:02.000
This is art."

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:05.000
I think it's people's curiosity

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:08.000
that motivates them

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:10.000
to come into the projects.

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:12.000
And then it becomes more.

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:15.000
It becomes a desire, a need, an armor.

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:19.000
On this bridge that's in Monrovia,

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:22.000
ex-rebel soldiers helped us pasting a portrait

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:25.000
of a woman that might have been raped during the war.

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:27.000
Women are always the first ones targeted

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:30.000
during conflict.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.000
This is Kibera, Kenya,

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:35.000
one of the largest slums of Africa.

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:38.000
You might have seen images about the post-election violence

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:41.000
that happened there in 2008.

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:44.000
This time we covered the roofs of the houses,

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:47.000
but we didn't use paper,

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:50.000
because paper doesn't prevent the rain

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:52.000
from leaking inside the house --

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:54.000
vinyl does.

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:56.000
Then art becomes useful.

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:58.000
So the people kept it.

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:01.000
You know what I love is, for example, when you see the biggest eye there,

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.000
there are so [many] houses inside.

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:05.000
And I went there a few months ago --

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:08.000
photos are still there -- and it was missing a piece of the eye.

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:10.000
So I asked the people what happened.

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:12.000
"Oh, that guy just moved."

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:16.000
(Laughter)

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:19.000
When the roofs were covered, a woman said as a joke,

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:21.000
"Now God can see me."

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:23.000
When you look at Kibera now,

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:25.000
they look back.

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:31.000
Okay, India.

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:33.000
Before I start that, just so you know,

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:35.000
each time we go to a place, we don't have authorization,

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:37.000
so we set up like commandos --

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:39.000
we're a group of friends who arrive there,

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:41.000
and we try to paste on the walls.

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:44.000
But there are places where you just can't paste on a wall.

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:47.000
In India it was just impossible to paste.

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:50.000
I heard culturally and because of the law,

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:53.000
they would just arrest us at the first pasting.

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:55.000
So we decided to paste white,

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:57.000
white on the walls.

00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:59.000
So imagine white guys pasting white papers.

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:01.000
So people would come to us and ask us,

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:03.000
"Hey, what are you up to?"

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:06.000
"Oh, you know, we're just doing art." "Art?"

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:09.000
Of course, they were confused.

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:12.000
But you know how India has a lot of dust in the streets,

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:14.000
and the more dust you would have

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:16.000
going up in the air,

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:19.000
on the white paper you can almost see,

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:21.000
but there is this sticky part

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:23.000
like when you reverse a sticker.

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:26.000
So the more dust you have, the more it will reveal the photo.

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:29.000
So we could just walk in the street during the next days

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:31.000
and the photos would get revealed by themselves.

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:38.000
(Applause)

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:40.000
Thank you.

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:43.000
So we didn't get caught this time.

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:48.000
Each project -- that's a film

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:51.000
from Women Are Heroes.

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:54.000
(Music)

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:56.000
Okay.

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:58.000
For each project we do

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:00.000
a film.

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:03.000
And most of what you see -- that's a trailer from "Women Are Heroes" --

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:06.000
its images, photography,

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:09.000
taken one after the other.

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:30.000
And the photos kept traveling even without us.

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:08.000
(Laughter)

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:18.000
(Applause)

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:20.000
Hopefully, you'll see the film,

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:22.000
and you'll understand the scope of the project

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:24.000
and what the people felt when they saw those photos.

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:27.000
Because that's a big part of it. There's layers behind each photo.

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:30.000
Behind each image is a story.

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:32.000
Women Are Heroes created a new dynamic

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:34.000
in each of the communities,

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:37.000
and the women kept that dynamic after we left.

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:40.000
For example, we did books -- not for sale --

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:42.000
that all the community would get.

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:46.000
But to get it, they would have to [get] it signed by one of the women.

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:48.000
We did that in most of the places.

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:50.000
We go back regularly.

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:53.000
And so in Providencia, for example, in the favela,

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:55.000
we have a cultural center running there.

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:57.000
In Kibera, each year we cover more roofs.

00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:00.000
Because of course, when we left, the people who were just at the edge of the project

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:03.000
said, "Hey, what about my roof?"

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:05.000
So we decided to come the year after

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:08.000
and keep doing the project.

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:10.000
A really important point for me

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:13.000
is that I don't use any brand or corporate sponsors.

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:15.000
So I have no responsibility

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:17.000
to anyone but myself

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:19.000
and the subjects.

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:23.000
(Applause)

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:25.000
And that is for me

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:27.000
one of the more important things in the work.

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:29.000
I think, today,

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:32.000
as important as the result is the way you do things.

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:35.000
And that has always been a central part of the work.

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:38.000
And what's interesting is that fine line that I have

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:40.000
with images and advertising.

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:42.000
We just did some pasting in Los Angeles

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:45.000
on another project in the last weeks.

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:49.000
And I was even invited to cover the MOCA museum.

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:51.000
But yesterday the city called them and said,

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:53.000
"Look, you're going to have to tear it down.

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:55.000
Because this can be taken for advertising,

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:57.000
and because of the law,

00:19:57.000 --> 00:19:59.000
it has to be taken down."

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:02.000
But tell me, advertising for what?

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:04.000
The people I photograph

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:06.000
were proud to participate in the project

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:08.000
and to have their photo in the community.

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:10.000
But they asked me for a promise basically.

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:14.000
They asked me, "Please, make our story travel with you."

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:17.000
So I did. That's Paris.

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:19.000
That's Rio.

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:23.000
In each place, we built exhibitions with a story, and the story traveled.

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:25.000
You understand the full scope of the project.

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:28.000
That's London.

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:30.000
New York.

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:33.000
And today, they are with you in Long Beach.

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:37.000
All right, recently I started a public art project

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:40.000
where I don't use my artwork anymore.

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:43.000
I use Man Ray, Helen Levitt,

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:45.000
Giacomelli, other people's artwork.

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:48.000
It doesn't matter today if it's your photo or not.

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:50.000
The importance is what you do

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:52.000
with the images,

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:55.000
the statement it makes where it's pasted.

00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:58.000
So for example, I pasted the photo of the minaret

00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:00.000
in Switzerland

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:04.000
a few weeks after they voted the law forbidding minarets in the country.

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:10.000
(Applause)

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:13.000
This image of three men wearing gas masks

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:15.000
was taken in Chernobyl originally,

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:18.000
and I pasted it in Southern Italy,

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:22.000
where the mafia sometimes bury the garbage under the ground.

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:26.000
In some ways, art can change the world.

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:28.000
Art is not supposed to change the world,

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:30.000
to change practical things,

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:32.000
but to change perceptions.

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:34.000
Art can change

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:36.000
the way we see the world.

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:39.000
Art can create an analogy.

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:42.000
Actually the fact that art cannot change things

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:44.000
makes it a neutral place

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:47.000
for exchanges and discussions,

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:50.000
and then enables you to change the world.

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:52.000
When I do my work,

00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:54.000
I have two kinds of reactions.

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:57.000
People say, "Oh, why don't you go in Iraq or Afghanistan.

00:21:57.000 --> 00:21:59.000
They would be really useful."

00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:02.000
Or, "How can we help?"

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:05.000
I presume that you belong to the second category,

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:07.000
and that's good,

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:09.000
because for that project,

00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:11.000
I'm going to ask you to take the photos

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:14.000
and paste them.

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:16.000
So now my wish is:

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:18.000
(mock drum roll)

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:20.000
(Laughter)

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:24.000
I wish for you to stand up

00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:27.000
for what you care about

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:30.000
by participating in a global art project,

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:35.000
and together we'll turn the world inside out.

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:38.000
And this starts right now.

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:40.000
Yes, everyone in the room.

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:43.000
Everyone watching.

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:45.000
I wanted that wish

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:47.000
to actually start now.

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:50.000
So a subject you're passionate about, a person who you want to tell their story

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:52.000
or even your own photos --

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:54.000
tell me what you stand for.

00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:56.000
Take the photos, the portraits,

00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:59.000
upload it -- I'll give you all the details --

00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:02.000
and I'll send you back your poster. Join by groups

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:05.000
and reveal things to the world.

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:08.000
The full data is on the website --

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:10.000
insideoutproject.net --

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:13.000
that is launching today.

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:15.000
What we see changes who we are.

00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:17.000
When we act together,

00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:20.000
the whole thing is much more than the sum of the parts.

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:23.000
So I hope that, together, we'll create something

00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:25.000
that the world will remember.

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:28.000
And this starts right now and depends on you.

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:30.000
Thank you.

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:37.000
(Applause)

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:39.000
Thank you.

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:47.000
(Applause)
