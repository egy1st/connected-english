00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
This is Revolution 2.0.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
No one was a hero. No one was a hero.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Because everyone was a hero.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Everyone has done something.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
We all use Wikipedia.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
If you think of the concept of Wikipedia

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
where everyone is collaborating on content,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
and at the end of the day

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
you've built the largest encyclopedia in the world.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
From just an idea that sounded crazy,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
you have the largest encyclopedia in the world.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
And in the Egyptian revolution,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
the Revolution 2.0,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
everyone has contributed something,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
small or big. They contributed something --

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
to bring us

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
one of the most inspiring stories

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
in the history of mankind

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
when it comes to revolutions.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
It was actually really inspiring

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
to see all these Egyptians completely changing.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
If you look at the scene,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
Egypt, for 30 years, had been in a downhill --

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
going into a downhill.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
Everything was going bad.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
Everything was going wrong.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
We only ranked high when it comes to poverty,

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
corruption,

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
lack of freedom of speech,

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
lack of political activism.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
Those were the achievements

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
of our great regime.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
Yet, nothing was happening.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
And it's not because people were happy

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
or people were not frustrated.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
In fact, people were extremely frustrated.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
But the reason why everyone was silent

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.000
is what I call the psychological barrier of fear.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
Everyone was scared.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
Not everyone. There were actually a few brave Egyptians

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
that I have to thank for being so brave --

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
going into protests as a couple of hundred,

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
getting beaten up and arrested.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
But in fact, the majority were scared.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
Everyone did not want really

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
to get in trouble.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
A dictator cannot live without the force.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
They want to make people live in fear.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
And that psychological barrier of fear

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
had worked for so many years,

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
and here comes the Internet,

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000
technology, BlackBerry, SMS.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000
It's helping all of us to connect.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.000
Platforms like YouTube, Twitter, Facebook

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
were helping us a lot

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
because it basically gave us the impression that, "Wow, I'm not alone.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
There are a lot of people who are frustrated."

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
There are lots of people who are frustrated.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
There are lots of people who actually share the same dream.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
There are lots of people who care about their freedom.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
They probably have the best life in the world.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000
They are living in happiness. They are living in their villas.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
They are happy. They don't have problems.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.000
But they are still feeling the pain of the Egyptian.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
A lot of us, we're not really happy

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
when we see a video of an Egyptian man

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
who's eating the trash

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
while others are stealing

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
billions of Egyptian pounds

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
from the wealth of the country.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
The Internet has played a great role,

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000
helping these people to speak up their minds,

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000
to collaborate together, to start thinking together.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000
It was an educational campaign.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000
Khaled Saeed was killed

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000
in June 2010.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
I still remember the photo.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000
I still remember every single detail of that photo.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.000
The photo was horrible.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000
He was tortured,

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
brutally tortured to death.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
But then what was the answer of the regime?

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000
"He choked on a pile of hash" --

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000
that was their answer:

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000
"He's a criminal.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000
He's someone who escaped from all these bad things."

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000
But people did not relate to this.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000
People did not believe this.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.000
Because of the Internet, the truth prevailed

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000
and everyone knew the truth.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.000
And everyone started to think that "this guy could be my brother."

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000
He was a middle-class guy.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.000
His photo was remembered by all of us.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000
A page was created.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000
An anonymous administrator

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000
was basically inviting people to join the page,

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000
and there was no plan.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000
"What are we going to do?" "I don't know."

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.000
In a few days, tens of thousands of people there --

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000
angry Egyptians

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000
who were asking the ministry of interior affairs,

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000
"Enough.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.000
Get those who killed this guy.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000
To just bring them to justice."

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000
But of course, they don't listen.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000
It was an amazing story --

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.000
how everyone started feeling the ownership.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000
Everyone was an owner in this page.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000
People started contributing ideas.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000
In fact, one of the most ridiculous ideas

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000
was, "Hey, let's have a silent stand.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.000
Let's get people to go in the street,

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.000
face the sea, their back to the street,

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.000
dressed in black, standing up silently for one hour,

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000
doing nothing and then just leaving,

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000
going back home."

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000
For some people, that was like, "Wow, silent stand.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000
And next time it's going to be vibration."

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.000
People were making fun of the idea.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000
But actually when people went to the street --

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000
the first time it was thousands of people

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000
in Alexandria --

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.000
it felt like -- it was amazing. It was great

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000
because it connected people from the virtual world,

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000
bringing them to the real world,

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.000
sharing the same dream,

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000
the same frustration, the same anger,

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000
the same desire for freedom.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000
And they were doing this thing.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000
But did the regime learn anything? Not really.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000
They were actually attacking them.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000
They were actually abusing them,

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000
despite the fact of how peaceful these guys were --

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000
they were not even protesting.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.000
And things had developed

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.000
until the Tunisian revolution.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000
This whole page was, again,

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000
managed by the people.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.000
In fact, the anonymous admin job

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000
was to collect ideas,

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.000
help people to vote on them

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000
and actually tell them what they are doing.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000
People were taking shots and photos;

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.000
people were reporting violations of human rights in Egypt;

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000
people were suggesting ideas,

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.000
they were actually voting on ideas,

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.000
and then they were executing the ideas; people were creating videos.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.000
Everything was done by the people to the people,

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.000
and that's the power of the Internet.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000
There was no leader.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.000
The leader was everyone on that page.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.000
The Tunisian experiment, as Amir was saying,

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000
inspired all of us, showed us that there is a way.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000
Yes we can. We can do it.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.000
We have the same problems;

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.000
we can just go in the streets.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.000
And when I saw the street on the 25th,

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.000
I went back and said,

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000
"Egypt before the 25th

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000
is never going to be Egypt after the 25th.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000
The revolution is happening.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.000
This is not the end,

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.000
this is the beginning of the end."

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:41.000
I was detained on the 27th night.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.000
Thank God I announced the locations and everything.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.000
But they detained me.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:49.000
And I'm not going to talk about my experience, because this is not about me.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000
I was detained for 12 days,

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.000
blindfolded, handcuffed.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.000
And I did not really hear anything. I did not know anything.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.000
I was not allowed to speak with anyone.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000
And I went out.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.000
The next day I was in Tahrir.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.000
Seriously, with the amount of change I had noticed in this square,

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.000
I thought it was 12 years.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000
I never had in my mind

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.000
to see this Egyptian,

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000
the amazing Egyptian.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.000
The fear is no longer fear.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.000
It's actually strength -- it's power.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.000
People were so empowered.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.000
It was amazing how everyone was so empowered

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.000
and now asking for their rights.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.000
Completely opposite.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.000
Extremism became tolerance.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000
Who would [have] imagined before the 25th,

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.000
if I tell you that hundreds of thousands of Christians are going to pray

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.000
and tens of thousands of Muslims are going to protect them,

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.000
and then hundreds of thousands of Muslims are going to pray

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.000
and tens of thousands of Christians are going to protect them --

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.000
this is amazing.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.000
All the stereotypes

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:49.000
that the regime was trying to put on us

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:52.000
through their so-called propaganda, or mainstream media,

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000
are proven wrong.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.000
This whole revolution showed us

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:59.000
how ugly such a regime was

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.000
and how great and amazing

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:04.000
the Egyptian man, the Egyptian woman,

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.000
how simple and amazing these people are

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.000
whenever they have a dream.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.000
When I saw that,

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:13.000
I went back and I wrote on Facebook.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.000
And that was a personal belief,

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.000
regardless of what's going on,

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.000
regardless of the details.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.000
I said that, "We are going to win.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:24.000
We are going to win because we don't understand politics.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:28.000
We're going to win because we don't play their dirty games.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.000
We're going to win because we don't have an agenda.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:34.000
We're going to win because the tears that come from our eyes

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:37.000
actually come from our hearts.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:40.000
We're going to win because we have dreams.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:44.000
We're going to win because we are willing to stand up for our dreams."

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:47.000
And that's actually what happened. We won.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.000
And that's not because of anything,

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000
but because we believed in our dream.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.000
The winning here is not

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:56.000
the whole details of what's going to happen in the political scene.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.000
The winning is the winning of the dignity

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:01.000
of every single Egyptian.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:04.000
Actually, I had this taxi driver telling me,

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:07.000
"Listen, I am breathing freedom.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.000
I feel that I have dignity

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.000
that I have lost for so many years."

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.000
For me that's winning,

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.000
regardless of all the details.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:18.000
My last word to you is a statement I believe in,

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:21.000
which Egyptians have proven to be true,

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.000
that the power of the people

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.000
is much stronger than the people in power.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.000
Thanks a lot.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:46.000
(Applause)
