00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Well, this is about state budgets.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
This is probably the most boring topic

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
of the whole morning.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
But I want to tell you, I think it's an important topic

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
that we need to care about.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
State budgets

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
are big, big money --

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
I'll show you the numbers --

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
and they get very little scrutiny.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
The understanding is very low.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Many of the people involved

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
have special interests or short-term interests

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
that get them not thinking

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
about what the implications of the trends are.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
And these budgets

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
are the key for our future;

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
they're the key for our kids.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
Most education funding --

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
whether it's K through 12,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
or the great universities or community colleges --

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
most of the money for those things

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
is coming out of these state budgets.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
But we have a problem.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
Here's the overall picture.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
U.S. economy is big --

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
14.7 trillion.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
Now out of that pie,

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
the government spends 36 percent.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
So this is combining the federal level,

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
which is the largest,

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
the state level and the local level.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
And it's really in this combined way

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
that you get an overall sense of what's going on,

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
because there's a lot of complex things

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
like Medicaid and research money

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
that flow across those boundaries.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
But we're spending 36 percent.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
Well what are we taking in?

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
Simple business question.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
Answer is 26 percent.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.000
Now this leaves 10 percent deficit,

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
sort of a mind-blowing number.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
And some of that, in fact, is due to the fact

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
that we've had an economic recession.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
Receipts go down,

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
some spending programs go up,

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
but most of it is not because of that.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
Most of it is because of ways

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
that the liabilities are building up

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
and the trends,

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
and that creates a huge challenge.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
In fact, this is the forecast picture.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
There are various things in here:

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
I could say we might raise more revenue,

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.000
or medical innovation will make the spending even higher.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
It is an increasingly difficult picture,

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
even assuming the economy does quite well --

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
probably better than it will do.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
This is what you see

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
at this overall level.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
Now how did we get here?

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
How could you have a problem like this?

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
After all, at least on paper,

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
there's this notion that these state budgets are balanced.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
Only one state says

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
they don't have to balance the budget.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
But what this means actually

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
is that there's a pretense.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000
There's no real, true balancing going on,

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.000
and in a sense, the games they play to hide that

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
actually obscure the topic so much

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
that people don't see things

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.000
that are actually pretty straight-forward challenges.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
When Jerry Brown was elected,

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
this was the challenge that was put to him.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
That is, through various gimmicks and things,

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000
a so-called balanced budget

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.000
had led him to have 25 billion missing

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000
out of the 76 billion in proposed spending.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
Now he's put together some thoughts:

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000
About half of that he'll cut,

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
another half,

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
perhaps in a very complex set of steps,

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
taxes will be approved.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
But even so,

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000
as you go out into those future years,

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000
various pension costs, health costs go up enough,

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.000
and the revenue does not go up enough.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000
So you get a big squeeze.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.000
What were those things that allowed us to hide this?

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.000
Well, some really nice little tricks.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000
And these were somewhat noticed.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000
The paper said, "It's not really balanced.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000
It's got holes.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000
It perpetuates deficit spending.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
It's riddled with gimmicks."

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000
And really when you get down to it,

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000
the guys at Enron never would have done this.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000
This is so blatant,

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.000
so extreme.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000
Is anyone paying attention

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.000
to some of the things these guys do?

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000
They borrow money.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000
They're not supposed to, but they figure out a way.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000
They make you pay more in withholding

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000
just to help their cash flow out.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000
They sell off the assets.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.000
They defer the payments.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000
They sell off the revenues from tobacco.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000
And California's not unique.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000
In fact, there's about five states that are worse

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000
and only really four states

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000
that don't face this big challenge.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.000
So it's systemic across the entire country.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000
It really comes from the fact

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000
that certain long-term obligations --

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.000
health care, where innovation makes it more expensive,

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.000
early retirement and pension, where the age structure gets worse for you,

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000
and just generosity --

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000
that these mis-accounting things

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000
allow to develop over time,

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.000
that you've got a problem.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000
This is the retiree health care benefits.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000
Three million set aside, 62 billion dollar liability --

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000
much worse than the car companies.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000
And everybody looked at that

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.000
and knew that that was headed toward a huge problem.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000
The forecast for the medical piece alone

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000
is to go from 26 percent of the budget

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000
to 42 percent.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000
Well what's going to give?

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000
Well in order to accommodate that,

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:27.000
you would have to cut education spending in half.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000
It really is this young versus the old

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000
to some degree.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.000
If you don't change that revenue picture,

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000
if you don't solve what you're doing in health care,

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.000
you're going to be deinvesting in the young.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.000
The great University of California university system,

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.000
the great things that have gone on,

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000
won't happen.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.000
So far it's meant layoffs,

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000
increased class sizes.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.000
Within the education community there's this discussion of,

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.000
"Should it just be the young teachers who get laid off,

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000
or the less good teachers who get laid off?"

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.000
And there's a discussion: if you're going to increase class sizes,

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000
where do you do that? How much effect does that have?

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.000
And unfortunately, as you get into that, people get confused and think,

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000
well maybe you think that's okay.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.000
In fact, no, education spending should not be cut.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.000
There's ways, if it's temporary,

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000
to minimize the impact,

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000
but it's a problem.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.000
It's also really a problem for where we need to go.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.000
Technology has a role to play.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.000
Well we need money to experiment with that,

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000
to get those tools in there.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000
There's the idea of paying teachers for effectiveness,

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000
measuring them, giving them feedback,

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000
taking videos in the classroom.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000
That's something I think is very, very important.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000
Well you have to allocate dollars

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.000
for that system

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.000
and for that incentive pay.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000
In a situation where you have growth,

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000
you put the new money into this.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.000
Or even if you're flat, you might shift money into it.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.000
But with the type of cuts we're talking about,

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.000
it will be far, far harder

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.000
to get these incentives for excellence,

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000
or to move over

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.000
to use technology in the new way.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.000
So what's going on?

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000
Where's the brain trust

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.000
that's in error here?

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.000
Well there really is no brain trust.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.000
(Laughter)

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:12.000
It's sort of the voters. It's sort of us showing up.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.000
Just look at this spending.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.000
California will spend over 100 billion,

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.000
Microsoft, 38,

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.000
Google, about 19.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:23.000
The amount of IQ in good numeric analysis,

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.000
both inside Google and Microsoft

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:28.000
and outside, with analysts and people of various opinions --

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000
should they have spent on that?

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000
No, they wasted their money on this. What about this thing? --

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.000
it really is quite phenomenal.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.000
Everybody has an opinion.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:40.000
There's great feedback.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.000
And the numbers are used to make decisions.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:46.000
If you go over the education spending and the health care spending --

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:49.000
particularly these long-term trends --

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.000
you don't have that type of involvement

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.000
on a number that's more important

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:56.000
in terms of equity, in terms of learning.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.000
So what do we need to do?

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000
We need better tools.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000
We can get some things out on the Internet.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000
I'm going to use my website

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.000
to put up some things that will give the basic picture.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.000
We need lots more.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.000
There's a few good books,

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000
one about school spending and where the money comes from --

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.000
how that's changed over time, and the challenge.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.000
We need better accounting.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.000
We need to take the fact

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.000
that the current employees, the future liabilities they create,

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:24.000
that should come out of the current budget.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000
We need to understand why they've done the pension accounting

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000
the way they have.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.000
It should be more like private accounting.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000
It's the gold standard.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:35.000
And finally, we need to really reward politicians.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.000
Whenever they say there's these long-term problems,

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.000
we can't say, "Oh, you're the messenger with bad news?

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.000
We just shot you."

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.000
In fact, there are some like these:

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000
Erskine Bowles, Alan Simpson and others,

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:49.000
who have gone through and given proposals

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:53.000
for this overall federal health-spending state-level problem.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.000
But in fact, their work was sort of pushed off.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:58.000
In fact, the week afterwards,

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.000
some tax cuts were done

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000
that made the situation even worse

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000
than their assumptions.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.000
So we need these pieces.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:09.000
Now I think this is a solvable problem.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.000
It's a great country with lots of people.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:16.000
But we have to draw those people in,

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.000
because this is about education.

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.000
And just look at what happened with the tuitions

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.000
with the University of California

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:25.000
and project that out for another three, four, five years --

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:28.000
it's unaffordable.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.000
And that's the kind of thing --

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.000
the investment in the young --

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.000
that makes us great, allows us to contribute.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.000
It allows us to do the art,

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.000
the biotechnology, the software

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:42.000
and all those magic things.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:44.000
And so the bottom line is

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:47.000
we need to care about state budgets

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.000
because they're critical for our kids and our future.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.000
Thank you.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:54.000
(Applause)
