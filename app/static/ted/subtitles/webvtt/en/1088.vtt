00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
There's actually a major health crisis today

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
in terms of the shortage of organs.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
The fact is that we're living longer.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Medicine has done a much better job

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
of making us live longer,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
and the problem is, as we age,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
our organs tend to fail more,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
and so currently

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
there are not enough organs to go around.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
In fact, in the last 10 years,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
the number of patients requiring an organ has doubled,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
while in the same time,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
the actual number of transplants has barely gone up.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
So this is now a public health crisis.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
So that's where this field comes in

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
that we call the field of regenerative medicine.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
It really involves many different areas.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
You can use, actually, scaffolds,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
biomaterials --

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
they're like the piece of your blouse or your shirt --

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
but specific materials you can actually implant in patients

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
and they will do well and help you regenerate.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
Or we can use cells alone,

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
either your very own cells

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
or different stem cell populations.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
Or we can use both.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
We can use, actually, biomaterials

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
and the cells together.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
And that's where the field is today.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
But it's actually not a new field.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
Interestingly, this is a book

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
that was published back in 1938.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
It's titled "The Culture of Organs."

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
The first author, Alexis Carrel, a Nobel Prize winner.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
He actually devised some of the same technologies

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
used today for suturing blood vessels,

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
and some of the blood vessel grafts we use today

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
were actually designed by Alexis.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
But I want you to note his co-author:

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
Charles Lindbergh.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
That's the same Charles Lindbergh

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
who actually spent the rest of his life

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
working with Alexis

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
at the Rockefeller Institute in New York

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
in the area of the culture of organs.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
So if the field's been around for so long,

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
why so few clinical advances?

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
And that really has to do to many different challenges.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
But if I were to point to three challenges,

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
the first one is actually the design of materials

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
that could go in your body

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
and do well over time.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
And many advances now,

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
we can do that fairly readily.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
The second challenge was cells.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000
We could not get enough of your cells to grow outside of your body.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000
Over the last 20 years, we've basically tackled that.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
Many scientists can now grow many different types of cells.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
Plus we have stem cells.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
But even now, 2011,

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.000
there's still certain cells that we just can't grow from the patient.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000
Liver cells, nerve cells, pancreatic cells --

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000
we still can't grow them even today.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
And the third challenge is vascularity,

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
the actual supply of blood

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
to allow those organs or tissues to survive

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
once we regenerate them.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000
So we can actually use biomaterials now.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
This is actually a biomaterial.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
We can weave them, knit them, or we can make them like you see here.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000
This is actually like a cotton candy machine.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
You saw the spray going in.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000
That was like the fibers of the cotton candy

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
creating this structure, this tubularized structure,

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
which is a biomaterial

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
that we can then use

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
to help your body regenerate

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
using your very own cells to do so.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000
And that's exactly what we did here.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000
This is actually a patient

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
who [was] presented with a deceased organ,

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000
and we then created one of these smart biomaterials,

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
and then we then used that smart biomaterial

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000
to replace and repair

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
that patient's structure.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
What we did was we actually

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000
used the biomaterial as a bridge

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000
so that the cells in the organ

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
could walk on that bridge, if you will,

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000
and help to bridge the gap

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
to regenerate that tissue.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000
And you see that patient now six months after

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000
with an X-ray showing you the regenerated tissue,

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000
which is fully regenerated

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.000
when you analyze it under the microscope.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000
We can also use cells alone.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.000
These are actually cells that we obtained.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.000
These are stem cells that we create from specific sources,

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000
and we can drive them to become heart cells,

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000
and they start beating in culture.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000
So they know what to do.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000
The cells genetically know what to do,

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
and they start beating together.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
Now today, many clinical trials

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000
are using different kinds of stem cells

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000
for heart disease.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.000
So that's actually now in patients.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000
Or if we're going to use larger structures

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000
to replace larger structures,

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000
we can then use the patient's own cells,

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000
or some cell population,

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000
and the biomaterials,

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000
the scaffolds, together.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000
So the concept here:

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.000
so if you do have a deceased or injured organ,

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000
we take a very small piece of that tissue,

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000
less than half the size of a postage stamp.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000
We then tease the cells apart,

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000
we grow the cells outside the body.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.000
We then take a scaffold, a biomaterial --

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.000
again, looks very much like a piece of your blouse or your shirt --

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000
we then shape that material,

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.000
and we then use those cells to coat that material

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000
one layer at a time --

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.000
very much like baking a layer cake, if you will.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000
We then place it in an oven-like device,

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000
and we're able to create that structure

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000
and bring it out.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000
This is actually a heart valve

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000
that we've engineered,

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.000
and you can see here, we have the structure of the heart valve

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.000
and we've seeded that with cells,

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000
and then we exercise it.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000
So you see the leaflets opening and closing --

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000
of this heart valve

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:17.000
that's currently being used experimentally

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.000
to try to get it to further studies.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000
Another technology

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000
that we have used in patients

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000
actually involves bladders.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.000
We actually take a very small piece of the bladder from the patient --

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.000
less than half the size of a postage stamp.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.000
We then grow the cells outside the body,

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000
take the scaffold, coat the scaffold with the cells --

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.000
the patient's own cells, two different cell types.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.000
We then put it in this oven-like device.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.000
It has the same conditions as the human body --

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.000
37 degrees centigrade, 95 percent oxygen.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.000
A few weeks later, you have your engineered organ

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.000
that we're able to implant back into the patient.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.000
For these specific patients, we actually just suture these materials.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.000
We use three-dimensional imagining analysis,

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.000
but we actually created these biomaterials by hand.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000
But we now have better ways

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000
to create these structures with the cells.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:11.000
We use now some type of technologies,

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.000
where for solid organs, for example,

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000
like the liver,

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.000
what we do is we take discard livers.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.000
As you know, a lot of organs are actually discarded, not used.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.000
So we can take these liver structures,

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.000
which are not going to be used,

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:29.000
and we then put them in a washing machine-like structure

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000
that will allow the cells to be washed away.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.000
Two weeks later,

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.000
you have something that looks like a liver.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.000
You can hold it like a liver,

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:40.000
but it has no cells; it's just a skeleton of the liver.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:44.000
And we then can re-perfuse the liver with cells,

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.000
preserving the blood vessel tree.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:49.000
So we actually perfuse first the blood vessel tree

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000
with the patient's own blood vessel cells,

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.000
and we then infiltrate the parenchyma with the liver cells.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000
And we now have been able just to show

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.000
the creation of human liver tissue

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000
just this past month

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.000
using this technology.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.000
Another technology that we've used

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.000
is actually that of printing.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:11.000
This is actually a desktop inkjet printer,

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.000
but instead of using ink,

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000
we're using cells.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.000
And you can actually see here the printhead

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.000
going through and printing this structure,

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.000
and it takes about 40 minutes to print this structure.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.000
And there's a 3D elevator

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.000
that then actually goes down one layer at a time

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.000
each time the printhead goes through.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.000
And then finally you're able to get that structure out.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.000
You can pop that structure out of the printer and implant it.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.000
And this is actually a piece of bone

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.000
that I'm going to show you in this slide

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:41.000
that was actually created with this desktop printer

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:44.000
and implanted as you see here.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.000
That was all new bone that was implanted

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:49.000
using these techniques.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:53.000
Another more advanced technology we're looking at right now,

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.000
our next generation of technologies,

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.000
are more sophisticated printers.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:00.000
This particular printer we're designing now

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.000
is actually one where we print right on the patient.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.000
So what you see here --

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.000
I know it sounds funny,

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.000
but that's the way it works.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:12.000
Because in reality, what you want to do

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.000
is you actually want to have the patient on the bed with the wound,

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.000
and you have a scanner,

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.000
basically like a flatbed scanner.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.000
That's what you see here on the right side.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.000
You see a scanner technology

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:26.000
that first scans the wound on the patient

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:29.000
and then it comes back with the printheads

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:32.000
actually printing the layers that you require

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.000
on the patients themselves.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.000
This is how it actually works.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.000
Here's the scanner going through,

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.000
scanning the wound.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000
Once it's scanned,

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.000
it sends information in the correct layers of cells

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000
where they need to be.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.000
And now you're going to see here

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000
a demo of this actually being done

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:53.000
in a representative wound.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:56.000
And we actually do this with a gel so that you can lift the gel material.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.000
So once those cells are on the patient

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.000
they will stick where they need to be.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000
And this is actually new technology

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:05.000
still under development.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:08.000
We're also working on more sophisticated printers.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.000
Because in reality, our biggest challenge

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.000
are the solid organs.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.000
I don't know if you realize this,

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:18.000
but 90 percent of the patients on the transplant list

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:21.000
are actually waiting for a kidney.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.000
Patients are dying every day

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:26.000
because we don't have enough of those organs to go around.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.000
So this is more challenging --

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.000
large organ, vascular,

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.000
a lot of blood vessel supply,

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.000
a lot of cells present.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.000
So the strategy here is --

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.000
this is actually a CT scan, an X-ray --

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.000
and we go layer by layer,

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.000
using computerized morphometric imaging analysis

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:44.000
and 3D reconstruction

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:47.000
to get right down to those patient's own kidneys.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:50.000
We then are able to actually image those,

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.000
do 360 degree rotation

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.000
to analyze the kidney

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:58.000
in its full volumetric characteristics,

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.000
and we then are able

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.000
to actually take this information

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.000
and then scan this

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.000
in a printing computerized form.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:09.000
So we go layer by layer through the organ,

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:12.000
analyzing each layer as we go through the organ,

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:16.000
and we then are able to send that information, as you see here,

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.000
through the computer

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.000
and actually design the organ

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.000
for the patient.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:25.000
This actually shows the actual printer.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.000
And this actually shows that printing.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:31.000
In fact, we actually have the printer right here.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:34.000
So while we've been talking today,

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:37.000
you can actually see the printer

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:40.000
back here in the back stage.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.000
That's actually the actual printer right now,

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.000
and that's been printing this kidney structure

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.000
that you see here.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.000
It takes about seven hours to print a kidney,

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:51.000
so this is about three hours into it now.

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:54.000
And Dr. Kang's going to walk onstage right now,

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:57.000
and we're actually going to show you one of these kidneys

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:00.000
that we printed a little bit earlier today.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:05.000
Put a pair of gloves here.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.000
Thank you.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.000
Go backwards.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:24.000
So, these gloves are a little bit small on me, but here it is.

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.000
You can actually see that kidney

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.000
as it was printed earlier today.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:44.000
(Applause)

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:47.000
Has a little bit of consistency to it.

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:51.000
This is Dr. Kang who's been working with us on this project,

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.000
and part of our team.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:56.000
Thank you, Dr. Kang. I appreciate it.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:01.000
(Applause)

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.000
So this is actually a new generation.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:05.000
This is actually the printer that you see here onstage.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:08.000
And this is actually a new technology we're working on now.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:13.000
In reality, we now have a long history of doing this.

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:15.000
I'm going to share with you a clip

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:18.000
in terms of technology we have had in patients now for a while.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.000
And this is actually a very brief clip --

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.000
only about 30 seconds --

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:25.000
of a patient who actually received an organ.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.000
(Video) Luke Massella: I was really sick. I could barely get out of bed.

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:30.000
I was missing school. It was pretty much miserable.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.000
I couldn't go out

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.000
and play basketball at recess

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.000
without feeling like I was going to pass out

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.000
when I got back inside.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:41.000
I felt so sick.

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:44.000
I was facing basically a lifetime of dialysis,

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:46.000
and I don't even like to think about what my life would be like

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.000
if I was on that.

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.000
So after the surgery,

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:52.000
life got a lot better for me.

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.000
I was able to do more things.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.000
I was able to wrestle in high school.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:59.000
I became the captain of the team, and that was great.

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:02.000
I was able to be a normal kid with my friends.

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:05.000
And because they used my own cells to build this bladder,

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:07.000
it's going to be with me.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:10.000
I've got it for life, so I'm all set.

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:48.000
(Applause)

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.000
Juan Enriquez: These experiments sometimes work,

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.000
and it's very cool when they do.

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:54.000
Luke, come up please.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:14.000
(Applause)

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.000
So Luke, before last night,

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.000
when's the last time you saw Tony?

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:21.000
LM: Ten years ago, when I had my surgery --

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:23.000
and it's really great to see him.

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:25.000
(Laughter)

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:31.000
(Applause)

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:33.000
JE: And tell us a little bit about what you're doing.

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:36.000
LM: Well right now I'm in college at the University of Connecticut.

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:40.000
I'm a sophomore and studying communications, TV and mass media,

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:43.000
and basically trying to live life like a normal kid,

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:45.000
which I always wanted growing up.

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:47.000
But it was hard to do that when I was born with spina bifida

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:50.000
and my kidneys and bladder weren't working.

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:52.000
I went through about 16 surgeries,

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:54.000
and it seemed impossible to do that

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:57.000
when I was in kidney failure when I was 10.

00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:59.000
And this surgery came along

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:01.000
and basically made me who I am today

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.000
and saved my life.

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:14.000
(Applause)

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:17.000
JE: And Tony's done hundreds of these?

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:20.000
LM: What I know from, he's working really hard in his lab

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:22.000
and coming up with crazy stuff.

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:25.000
I know I was one of the first 10 people to have this surgery.

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:28.000
And when I was 10, I didn't realize how amazing it was.

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:30.000
I was a little kid, and I was like,

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:32.000
"Yeah. I'll have that. I'll have that surgery."

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:34.000
(Laughter)

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:36.000
All I wanted to do was to get better,

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:39.000
and I didn't realize how amazing it really was until now that I'm older

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:42.000
and I see the amazing things that he's doing.

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:46.000
JE: When you got this call out of the blue --

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:48.000
Tony's really shy,

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:50.000
and it took a lot of convincing

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:52.000
to get somebody as modest as Tony

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:55.000
to allow us to bring Luke.

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:57.000
So Luke, you go to your communications professors --

00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:59.000
you're majoring in communications --

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:01.000
and you ask them for permission to come to TED,

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:03.000
which might have a little bit to do with communications,

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:06.000
and what was their reaction?

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:08.000
LM: Most of my professors were all for it,

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:11.000
and they said, "Bring pictures

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:14.000
and show me the clips online," and "I'm happy for you."

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:16.000
There were a couple that were a little stubborn,

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:18.000
but I had to talk to them.

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:21.000
I pulled them aside.

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:23.000
JE: Well, it's an honor and a privilege to meet you.

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:25.000
Thank you so much. (LM: Thank you so much.)

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:30.000
JE: Thank you, Tony.

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:33.000
(Applause)
