WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
So I was born

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
on the last day

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
of the last year of the '70s.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
I was raised on "Free to be you and me" --

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
(cheering)

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
hip-hop --

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
not as many woohoos for hip-hop in the house.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Thank you. Thank you for hip-hop --

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
and Anita Hill.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
(Cheering)

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
My parents were radicals --

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
(Laughter)

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
who became,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
well, grown-ups.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
My dad facetiously says,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
"We wanted to save the world,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
and instead we just got rich."

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
We actually just got "middle class"

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
in Colorado Springs, Colorado,

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
but you get the picture.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
I was raised with a very heavy sense

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
of unfinished legacy.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
At this ripe old age of 30,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
I've been thinking a lot about what it means to grow up

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
in this horrible, beautiful time,

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
and I've decided, for me,

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
it's been a real journey and paradox.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
The first paradox

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
is that growing up is about rejecting the past

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
and then promptly reclaiming it.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
Feminism was the water I grew up in.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
When I was just a little girl,

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
my mom started what is now

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
the longest-running women's film festival in the world.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
So while other kids were watching sitcoms and cartoons,

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
I was watching very esoteric documentaries

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
made by and about women.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
You can see how this had an influence.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
But she was not the only feminist in the house.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
My dad actually resigned

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
from the male-only business club in my hometown

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
because he said he would never be part of an organization

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
that would one day welcome his son, but not his daughter.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:52.000
(Applause)

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
He's actually here today.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.000
(Applause)

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
The trick here

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
is my brother would become an experimental poet,

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
not a businessman,

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
but the intention was really good.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
(Laughter)

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
In any case, I didn't readily claim the feminist label,

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
even though it was all around me,

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
because I associated it with my mom's women's groups,

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
her swishy skirts and her shoulder pads --

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
none of which had much cachet

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
in the hallways of Palmer High School

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
where I was trying to be cool at the time.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
But I suspected there was something really important

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
about this whole feminism thing,

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000
so I started covertly tiptoeing into my mom's bookshelves

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000
and picking books off and reading them --

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
never, of course, admitting that I was doing so.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000
I didn't actually claim the feminist label

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
until I went to Barnard College

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.000
and I heard Amy Richards and Jennifer Baumgardner speak for the first time.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000
They were the co-authors of a book called "Manifesta."

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000
So what very profound epiphany, you might ask,

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.000
was responsible for my feminist click moment?

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
Fishnet stockings.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
Jennifer Baumgardner was wearing them.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
I thought they were really hot.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000
I decided, okay, I can claim the feminist label.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000
Now I tell you this --

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
I tell you this at the risk of embarrassing myself,

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
because I think part of the work of feminism

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000
is to admit that aesthetics, that beauty,

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
that fun do matter.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000
There are lots of very modern political movements

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000
that have caught fire in no small part

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000
because of cultural hipness.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.000
Anyone heard of these two guys as an example?

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.000
So my feminism is very indebted to my mom's,

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
but it looks very different.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
My mom says, "patriarchy."

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000
I say, "intersectionality."

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.000
So race, class, gender, ability,

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000
all of these things go into our experiences

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000
of what it means to be a woman.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000
Pay equity? Yes. Absolutely a feminist issue.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.000
But for me, so is immigration. (Applause)

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000
Thank you.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000
My mom says, "Protest march."

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000
I say, "Online organizing."

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000
I co-edit, along with a collective

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000
of other super-smart, amazing women,

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000
a site called Feministing.com.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:06.000
We are the most widely read feminist publication ever,

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000
and I tell you this

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000
because I think it's really important to see

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000
that there's a continuum.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000
Feminist blogging is basically the 21st century version

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000
of consciousness raising.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.000
But we also have a straightforward political impact.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000
Feministing has been able

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000
to get merchandise pulled off the shelves of Walmart.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000
We got a misogynist administrator sending us hate-mail

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000
fired from a Big Ten school.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.000
And one of our biggest successes

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.000
is we get mail from teenage girls in the middle of Iowa

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.000
who say, "I Googled Jessica Simpson and stumbled on your site.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.000
I realized feminism wasn't about man-hating and Birkenstocks."

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.000
So we're able to pull in the next generation

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000
in a totally new way.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.000
My mom says, "Gloria Steinem."

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000
I say, "Samhita Mukhopadhyay,

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000
Miriam Perez, Ann Friedman,

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000
Jessica Valenti, Vanessa Valenti,

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000
and on and on and on and on."

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000
We don't want one hero.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000
We don't want one icon.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000
We don't want one face.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000
We are thousands of women and men across this country

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000
doing online writing, community organizing,

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.000
changing institutions from the inside out --

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000
all continuing the incredible work

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.000
that our mothers and grandmothers started.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000
Thank you.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000
(Applause)

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000
Which brings me to the second paradox:

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000
sobering up about our smallness

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000
and maintaining faith in our greatness

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000
all at once.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000
Many in my generation --

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.000
because of well-intentioned parenting and self-esteem education --

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000
were socialized to believe

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000
that we were special little snowflakes --

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000
(Laughter)

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.000
who were going to go out and save the world.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.000
These are three words many of us were raised with.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.000
We walk across graduation stages,

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000
high on our overblown expectations,

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000
and when we float back down to earth,

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.000
we realize we don't know what the heck it means

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.000
to actually save the world anyway.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.000
The mainstream media often paints my generation

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.000
as apathetic,

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000
and I think it's much more accurate

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000
to say we are deeply overwhelmed.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.000
And there's a lot to be overwhelmed about, to be fair --

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.000
an environmental crisis,

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.000
wealth disparity in this country

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000
unlike we've seen since 1928,

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000
and globally,

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.000
a totally immoral and ongoing wealth disparity.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.000
Xenophobia's on the rise. The trafficking of women and girls.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.000
It's enough to make you feel very overwhelmed.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000
I experienced this firsthand myself

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.000
when I graduated from Barnard College in 2002.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.000
I was fired up; I was ready to make a difference.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.000
I went out and I worked at a non-profit,

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.000
I went to grad school, I phone-banked,

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.000
I protested, I volunteered,

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.000
and none of it seemed to matter.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000
And on a particularly dark night

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000
of December of 2004,

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000
I sat down with my family,

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.000
and I said that I had become very disillusioned.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.000
I admitted that I'd actually had a fantasy -- kind of a dark fantasy --

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000
of writing a letter

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000
about everything that was wrong with the world

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000
and then lighting myself on fire

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:07.000
on the White House steps.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000
My mom

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:13.000
took a drink of her signature Sea Breeze,

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:16.000
her eyes really welled with tears,

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:19.000
and she looked right at me and she said,

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.000
"I will not stand

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.000
for your desperation."

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:26.000
She said, "You are smarter, more creative

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.000
and more resilient than that."

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:32.000
Which brings me to my third paradox.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.000
Growing up is about aiming to succeed wildly

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:37.000
and being fulfilled by failing really well.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.000
(Laughter)

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.000
(Applause)

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:44.000
There's a writer I've been deeply influenced by, Parker Palmer,

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.000
and he writes that many of us are often whiplashed

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:49.000
"between arrogant overestimation of ourselves

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:52.000
and a servile underestimation of ourselves."

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000
You may have guessed by now,

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.000
I did not light myself on fire.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:59.000
I did what I know to do in desperation, which is write.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:02.000
I wrote the book I needed to read.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000
I wrote a book about eight incredible people

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.000
all over this country

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.000
doing social justice work.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.000
I wrote about Nia Martin-Robinson,

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000
the daughter of Detroit and two civil rights activists,

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.000
who's dedicating her life

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.000
to environmental justice.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.000
I wrote about Emily Apt

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.000
who initially became a caseworker in the welfare system

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:23.000
because she decided that was the most noble thing she could do,

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.000
but quickly learned, not only did she not like it,

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.000
but she wasn't really good at it.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.000
Instead, what she really wanted to do was make films.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000
So she made a film about the welfare system

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.000
and had a huge impact.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.000
I wrote about Maricela Guzman, the daughter of Mexican immigrants,

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:40.000
who joined the military so she could afford college.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000
She was actually sexually assaulted in boot camp

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.000
and went on to co-organize a group

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:47.000
called the Service Women's Action Network.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.000
What I learned from these people and others

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000
was that I couldn't judge them

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:54.000
based on their failure to meet their very lofty goals.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:57.000
Many of them are working in deeply intractable systems --

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.000
the military, congress,

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.000
the education system, etc.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.000
But what they managed to do within those systems

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:06.000
was be a humanizing force.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.000
And at the end of the day,

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.000
what could possibly be more important than that?

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.000
Cornel West says, "Of course it's a failure.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.000
But how good a failure is it?"

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:18.000
This isn't to say we give up our wildest, biggest dreams.

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.000
It's to say we operate on two levels.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.000
On one,

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.000
we really go after changing these broken systems

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.000
of which we find ourselves a part.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.000
But on the other, we root our self-esteem

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:31.000
in the daily acts of trying to make one person's day

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:34.000
more kind, more just, etc.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.000
So when I was a little girl,

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.000
I had a couple of very strange habits.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.000
One of them was

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.000
I used to lie on the kitchen floor of my childhood home,

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:44.000
and I would suck the thumb of my left hand

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:47.000
and hold my mom's cold toes with my right hand.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.000
(Laughter)

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:52.000
I was listening to her talk on the phone, which she did a lot.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:55.000
She was talking about board meetings,

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.000
she was founding peace organizations,

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:00.000
she was coordinating carpools, she was consoling friends --

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.000
all these daily acts of care and creativity.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.000
And surely, at three and four years old,

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:08.000
I was listening to the soothing sound of her voice,

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:11.000
but I think I was also getting my first lesson in activist work.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.000
The activists I interviewed

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:16.000
had nothing in common, literally, except for one thing,

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.000
which was that they all cited their mothers

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.000
as their most looming and important

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.000
activist influences.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.000
So often, particularly at a young age,

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:27.000
we look far afield

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.000
for our models of the meaningful life,

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:32.000
and sometimes they're in our own kitchens,

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.000
talking on the phone, making us dinner,

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:38.000
doing all that keeps the world going around and around.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.000
My mom and so many women like her

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:43.000
have taught me that life is not about glory,

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:46.000
or certainty, or security even.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.000
It's about embracing the paradox.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:51.000
It's about acting in the face of overwhelm.

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:54.000
And it's about loving people really well.

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.000
And at the end of the day,

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:59.000
these things make for a lifetime

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.000
of challenge and reward.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:03.000
Thank you.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:05.000
(Applause)
