This song is one of Thomas' favorites,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
called "What You Do with What You've Got."

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
♫ You must know someone like him ♫

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
♫ He was tall and strong and lean ♫

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
♫ With a body like a greyhound ♫

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
♫ and a mind so sharp and keen ♫

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
♫ But his heart, just like laurel ♫

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
♫ grew twisted around itself ♫

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
♫ Till almost everything he did ♫

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
♫ brought pain to someone else ♫

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
♫ It's not just what you're born with ♫

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
♫ It's what you choose to bear ♫

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
♫ It's not how big your share is ♫

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
♫ It's how much you can share ♫

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
♫ It's not the fights you dreamed of ♫

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
♫ It's those you really fought ♫

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
♫ It's not what you've been given ♫

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.000
♫ It's what you do with what you've got ♫

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000
♫ What's the use of two strong legs ♫

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
♫ if you only run away? ♫

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
♫ And what's the use of the finest voice ♫

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
♫ if you've nothing good to say? ♫

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.000
♫ What's the use of strength and muscle ♫

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
♫ if you only push and shove? ♫

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
♫ And what's the use of two good ears ♫

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
♫ if you can't hear those you love? ♫

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:51.000
♫ What's the use of two strong legs ♫

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
♫ if you only run away? ♫

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000
♫ And what's the use of the finest voice ♫

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000
♫ if you've nothing good to say? ♫

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.000
♫ What's the use of strength and muscle ♫

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000
♫ if you only push and shove? ♫

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
♫ And what's the use of two good ears ♫

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000
♫ if you can't hear those you love? ♫

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000
♫ Between those who use their neighbors ♫

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000
♫ and those who use the cane ♫

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000
♫ Between those in constant power ♫

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000
♫ and those in constant pain ♫

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000
♫ Between those who run to glory ♫

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
♫ and those who cannot run ♫

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000
♫ Tell me which ones are the cripples ♫

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:38.000
♫ and which ones touch the sun ♫

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000
♫ Which ones touch the sun ♫

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000
♫ Which ones touch the sun ♫

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:52.000
(Applause) Thank you very much.
