00:00:00.976 --> 00:00:03.976
Khan Academy is most known
for its collection of videos,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:05.976
so before I go any further,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.339
let me show you a little bit of a montage.

00:00:09.363 --> 00:00:12.435
(Video) Salman Khan: So the hypotenuse
is now going to be five.

00:00:12.459 --> 00:00:15.752
This animal's fossils are only found
in this area of South America --

00:00:15.776 --> 00:00:17.356
a nice clean band here --

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:19.569
and this part of Africa.

00:00:19.593 --> 00:00:21.759
We can integrate over the surface,

00:00:21.783 --> 00:00:24.624
and the notation
usually is a capital sigma.

00:00:24.648 --> 00:00:27.814
National Assembly: They create
the Committee of Public Safety,

00:00:27.838 --> 00:00:29.799
which sounds like a very nice committee.

00:00:29.823 --> 00:00:33.528
Notice, this is an aldehyde,
and it's an alcohol.

00:00:33.552 --> 00:00:36.797
Start differentiating
into effector and memory cells.

00:00:36.821 --> 00:00:40.541
A galaxy. Hey! There's another galaxy.
Oh, look! There's another galaxy.

00:00:40.565 --> 00:00:42.976
And for dollars, is their 30 million,

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.039
plus the 20 million dollars
from the American manufacturer.

00:00:46.063 --> 00:00:49.563
If this does not blow your mind,

00:00:49.587 --> 00:00:51.594
then you have no emotion.

00:00:51.618 --> 00:00:52.976
(Laughter)

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.515
(Applause)

00:00:58.539 --> 00:01:02.520
(Live) SK: We now have
on the order of 2,200 videos,

00:01:02.544 --> 00:01:06.735
covering everything from basic arithmetic,
all the way to vector calculus,

00:01:06.759 --> 00:01:08.976
and some of the stuff
that you saw up there.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.404
We have a million students
a month using the site,

00:01:12.428 --> 00:01:15.976
watching on the order
of 100 to 200,000 videos a day.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.650
But what we're going to talk about in this
is how we're going to the next level.

00:01:20.674 --> 00:01:21.976
But before I do that,

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.364
I want to talk a little bit
about really just how I got started.

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.221
And some of you all might know,

00:01:28.245 --> 00:01:31.266
about five years ago,
I was an analyst at a hedge fund,

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.758
and I was in Boston,

00:01:33.782 --> 00:01:36.870
and I was tutoring my cousins
in New Orleans, remotely.

00:01:36.894 --> 00:01:39.235
And I started putting
the first YouTube videos up,

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:41.093
really just as a kind of nice-to-have,

00:01:41.117 --> 00:01:43.242
just kind of a supplement for my cousins,

00:01:43.266 --> 00:01:46.274
something that might give them
a refresher or something.

00:01:46.298 --> 00:01:48.938
And as soon as I put those
first YouTube videos up,

00:01:48.962 --> 00:01:50.466
something interesting happened.

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.834
Actually, a bunch of interesting
things happened.

00:01:52.858 --> 00:01:55.096
The first was the feedback
from my cousins.

00:01:55.707 --> 00:02:00.448
They told me that they preferred
me on YouTube than in person.

00:02:00.472 --> 00:02:07.000
(Laughter)

00:02:07.473 --> 00:02:11.763
And once you get over
the backhanded nature of that,

00:02:11.787 --> 00:02:14.095
there was actually something
very profound there.

00:02:14.119 --> 00:02:17.945
They were saying that they preferred
the automated version of their cousin

00:02:17.969 --> 00:02:19.119
to their cousin.

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:21.069
At first it's very unintuitive,

00:02:21.093 --> 00:02:24.851
but when you think about it from their
point of view, it makes a ton of sense.

00:02:24.875 --> 00:02:28.695
You have this situation where now
they can pause and repeat their cousin,

00:02:28.719 --> 00:02:31.743
without feeling
like they're wasting my time.

00:02:31.767 --> 00:02:34.139
If they have to review something

00:02:34.163 --> 00:02:36.718
that they should have learned
a couple of weeks ago,

00:02:36.742 --> 00:02:38.964
or maybe a couple of years ago,

00:02:38.988 --> 00:02:41.646
they don't have to be embarrassed
and ask their cousin.

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:45.012
They can just watch those videos;
if they're bored, they can go ahead.

00:02:45.036 --> 00:02:47.060
They can watch at their own time and pace.

00:02:47.084 --> 00:02:51.885
Probably the least-appreciated aspect
of this

00:02:51.909 --> 00:02:54.480
is the notion that the very first time

00:02:54.504 --> 00:02:58.352
that you're trying to get
your brain around a new concept,

00:02:58.376 --> 00:02:59.976
the very last thing you need

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.742
is another human being saying,
"Do you understand this?"

00:03:03.194 --> 00:03:04.588
And that's what was happening

00:03:04.612 --> 00:03:06.707
with the interaction
with my cousins before,

00:03:06.731 --> 00:03:12.237
and now they can just do it
in the intimacy of their own room.

00:03:13.313 --> 00:03:15.010
The other thing that happened is --

00:03:15.034 --> 00:03:17.848
I put them on YouTube just --

00:03:18.551 --> 00:03:20.350
I saw no reason to make it private,

00:03:20.374 --> 00:03:21.976
so I let other people watch it,

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.976
and then people started stumbling on it,

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.498
and I started getting
some comments and some letters

00:03:27.522 --> 00:03:29.728
and all sorts of feedback

00:03:29.752 --> 00:03:31.688
from random people around the world.

00:03:31.712 --> 00:03:33.386
These are just a few.

00:03:34.662 --> 00:03:37.688
This is actually from one
of the original calculus videos.

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:41.261
Someone wrote it on YouTube,
it was a YouTube comment:

00:03:41.285 --> 00:03:43.976
"First time I smiled doing a derivative."

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.896
(Laughter)

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:48.722
Let's pause here.

00:03:48.746 --> 00:03:50.698
This person did a derivative,

00:03:50.722 --> 00:03:51.899
and then they smiled.

00:03:51.923 --> 00:03:53.704
(Laughter)

00:03:53.728 --> 00:03:55.411
In response to that same comment --

00:03:55.435 --> 00:03:58.886
this is on the thread, you can go
on YouTube and look at the comments --

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:00.688
someone else wrote: "Same thing here.

00:04:00.712 --> 00:04:03.785
I actually got a natural high
and a good mood for the entire day,

00:04:03.809 --> 00:04:08.237
since I remember seeing
all of this matrix text in class,

00:04:08.261 --> 00:04:10.976
and here I'm all like, 'I know kung fu.'"

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:15.261
(Laughter)

00:04:15.285 --> 00:04:17.636
We get a lot of feedback
along those lines.

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:19.341
This clearly was helping people.

00:04:19.365 --> 00:04:23.067
But then, as the viewership
kept growing and kept growing,

00:04:23.091 --> 00:04:25.662
I started getting letters from people,

00:04:25.686 --> 00:04:27.423
and it was starting to become clear

00:04:27.447 --> 00:04:29.529
that it was more than just a nice-to-have.

00:04:29.553 --> 00:04:32.976
This is just an excerpt
from one of those letters:

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.471
"My 12 year-old son has autism,

00:04:35.495 --> 00:04:37.717
and has had a terrible time with math.

00:04:37.741 --> 00:04:38.976
We have tried everything,

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:40.976
viewed everything, bought everything.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.685
We stumbled on your video
on decimals, and it got through.

00:04:44.709 --> 00:04:46.693
Then we went on to the dreaded fractions.

00:04:46.717 --> 00:04:47.868
Again, he got it.

00:04:47.892 --> 00:04:49.058
We could not believe it.

00:04:49.082 --> 00:04:50.299
He is so excited."

00:04:51.184 --> 00:04:52.550
And so you can imagine,

00:04:52.574 --> 00:04:56.708
here I was, an analyst at a hedge fund --

00:04:56.732 --> 00:05:00.001
it was very strange for me to do
something of social value.

00:05:00.025 --> 00:05:01.976
(Laughter)

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:08.680
(Applause)

00:05:08.704 --> 00:05:11.976
But I was excited, so I kept going.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.698
And then a few other things
started to dawn on me;

00:05:14.722 --> 00:05:17.190
that not only would it
help my cousins right now,

00:05:17.214 --> 00:05:19.269
or these people who were sending letters,

00:05:19.293 --> 00:05:22.165
but that this content will never grow old,

00:05:22.189 --> 00:05:25.483
that it could help their kids
or their grandkids.

00:05:25.507 --> 00:05:30.269
If Isaac Newton had done
YouTube videos on calculus,

00:05:30.293 --> 00:05:31.531
I wouldn't have to.

00:05:31.555 --> 00:05:33.340
(Laughter)

00:05:33.364 --> 00:05:35.976
Assuming he was good. We don't know.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.602
(Laughter)

00:05:38.626 --> 00:05:41.666
The other thing that happened --
and even at this point, I said,

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:44.904
"OK, maybe it's a good supplement.
It's good for motivated students.

00:05:44.928 --> 00:05:46.754
It's good for maybe home-schoolers."

00:05:46.778 --> 00:05:50.053
But I didn't think it would somehow
penetrate the classroom.

00:05:50.077 --> 00:05:52.203
Then I started getting
letters from teachers,

00:05:52.227 --> 00:05:54.052
and the teachers would write, saying,

00:05:54.076 --> 00:05:56.297
"We've used your videos
to flip the classroom.

00:05:56.321 --> 00:05:58.898
You've given the lectures,
so now what we do --"

00:05:58.922 --> 00:06:02.460
And this could happen in every classroom
in America tomorrow --

00:06:02.484 --> 00:06:05.738
"what I do is I assign
the lectures for homework,

00:06:05.762 --> 00:06:07.785
and what used to be homework,

00:06:07.809 --> 00:06:10.761
I now have the students
doing in the classroom."

00:06:10.785 --> 00:06:13.253
And I want to pause here --

00:06:13.277 --> 00:06:17.870
(Applause)

00:06:17.894 --> 00:06:21.191
I want to pause here, because there's
a couple of interesting things.

00:06:21.215 --> 00:06:23.416
One, when those teachers are doing that,

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:24.976
there's the obvious benefit --

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.500
the benefit that now their students

00:06:27.524 --> 00:06:30.046
can enjoy the videos in the way
that my cousins did,

00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:33.476
they can pause, repeat at their
own pace, at their own time.

00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:36.681
But the more interesting thing --
and this is the unintuitive thing

00:06:36.705 --> 00:06:39.083
when you talk about technology
in the classroom --

00:06:39.107 --> 00:06:41.993
by removing the one-size-fits-all
lecture from the classroom,

00:06:42.017 --> 00:06:45.017
and letting students have
a self-paced lecture at home,

00:06:45.041 --> 00:06:46.692
then when you go to the classroom,

00:06:46.716 --> 00:06:49.216
letting them do work,
having the teacher walk around,

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:52.326
having the peers actually be able
to interact with each other,

00:06:52.350 --> 00:06:57.984
these teachers have used technology
to humanize the classroom.

00:06:58.008 --> 00:07:00.470
They took a fundamentally
dehumanizing experience --

00:07:00.494 --> 00:07:02.985
30 kids with their fingers on their lips,

00:07:03.009 --> 00:07:04.963
not allowed to interact with each other.

00:07:04.987 --> 00:07:06.479
A teacher, no matter how good,

00:07:06.503 --> 00:07:09.812
has to give this one-size-fits-all
lecture to 30 students --

00:07:09.836 --> 00:07:12.199
blank faces, slightly antagonistic --

00:07:12.223 --> 00:07:13.794
and now it's a human experience,

00:07:13.818 --> 00:07:16.127
now they're actually
interacting with each other.

00:07:16.151 --> 00:07:18.936
So once the Khan Academy --

00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:20.112
I quit my job,

00:07:20.136 --> 00:07:22.580
and we turned into a real organization --

00:07:22.604 --> 00:07:24.397
we're a not-for-profit --

00:07:24.421 --> 00:07:27.515
the question is, how do we take this
to the next level?

00:07:27.539 --> 00:07:31.047
How do we take what those teachers
were doing to its natural conclusion?

00:07:31.071 --> 00:07:32.976
And so, what I'm showing over here,

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.634
these are actual exercises

00:07:35.658 --> 00:07:37.976
that I started writing for my cousins.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.096
The ones I started
were much more primitive.

00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:43.490
This is a more competent version of it.

00:07:43.514 --> 00:07:46.903
But the paradigm here is, we'll generate
as many questions as you need,

00:07:46.927 --> 00:07:49.976
until you get that concept,
until you get 10 in a row.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:51.976
And the Khan Academy videos are there.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.333
You get hints, the actual
steps for that problem,

00:07:54.357 --> 00:07:56.314
if you don't know how to do it.

00:07:56.338 --> 00:07:58.648
The paradigm here seems
like a very simple thing:

00:07:58.672 --> 00:07:59.870
10 in a row, you move on.

00:07:59.894 --> 00:08:01.474
But it's fundamentally different

00:08:01.498 --> 00:08:03.785
than what's happening
in classrooms right now.

00:08:03.809 --> 00:08:05.711
In a traditional classroom,

00:08:05.735 --> 00:08:08.976
you have homework, lecture,
homework, lecture,

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:10.839
and then you have a snapshot exam.

00:08:10.863 --> 00:08:14.520
And that exam, whether you get
a 70 percent, an 80 percent,

00:08:14.544 --> 00:08:15.989
a 90 percent or a 95 percent,

00:08:16.013 --> 00:08:18.456
the class moves on to the next topic.

00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:20.225
And even that 95 percent student --

00:08:20.249 --> 00:08:22.258
what was the five percent
they didn't know?

00:08:22.282 --> 00:08:26.103
Maybe they didn't know what happens when
you raise something to the zeroth power.

00:08:26.127 --> 00:08:28.376
Then you build on that
in the next concept.

00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:31.740
That's analogous to --
imagine learning to ride a bicycle.

00:08:31.764 --> 00:08:34.633
Maybe I give you a lecture ahead of time,

00:08:34.657 --> 00:08:38.570
and I give you a bicycle for two weeks,
then I come back after two weeks,

00:08:38.594 --> 00:08:41.744
and say, "Well, let's see.
You're having trouble taking left turns.

00:08:41.768 --> 00:08:45.005
You can't quite stop.
You're an 80 percent bicyclist."

00:08:45.029 --> 00:08:47.451
So I put a big "C" stamp
on your forehead --

00:08:47.475 --> 00:08:48.537
(Laughter)

00:08:48.561 --> 00:08:50.323
and then I say, "Here's a unicycle."

00:08:50.347 --> 00:08:51.441
(Laughter)

00:08:51.465 --> 00:08:53.300
But as ridiculous as that sounds,

00:08:53.324 --> 00:08:56.976
that's exactly what's happening
in our classrooms right now.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.609
And the idea is you fast forward

00:08:59.633 --> 00:09:02.619
and good students start failing
algebra all of the sudden,

00:09:02.643 --> 00:09:04.947
and start failing
calculus all of the sudden,

00:09:04.971 --> 00:09:07.329
despite being smart,
despite having good teachers,

00:09:07.353 --> 00:09:10.097
and it's usually because they have
these Swiss cheese gaps

00:09:10.121 --> 00:09:12.330
that kept building
throughout their foundation.

00:09:12.354 --> 00:09:15.932
So our model is: learn math
the way you'd learn anything,

00:09:15.956 --> 00:09:17.302
like riding a bicycle.

00:09:17.326 --> 00:09:20.397
Stay on that bicycle.
Fall off that bicycle.

00:09:20.421 --> 00:09:23.452
Do it as long as necessary,
until you have mastery.

00:09:23.476 --> 00:09:24.976
The traditional model,

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.572
it penalizes you
for experimentation and failure,

00:09:27.596 --> 00:09:29.619
but it does not expect mastery.

00:09:29.643 --> 00:09:32.707
We encourage you to experiment.
We encourage you to fail.

00:09:32.731 --> 00:09:34.381
But we do expect mastery.

00:09:35.921 --> 00:09:37.841
This is just another one of the modules.

00:09:37.865 --> 00:09:39.285
This is trigonometry.

00:09:39.309 --> 00:09:41.824
This is shifting and reflecting functions.

00:09:42.571 --> 00:09:43.975
And they all fit together.

00:09:43.999 --> 00:09:45.957
We have about 90 of these right now.

00:09:45.981 --> 00:09:47.590
You can go to the site right now,

00:09:47.614 --> 00:09:49.686
it's all free,
not trying to sell anything.

00:09:49.710 --> 00:09:52.850
But the general idea is that they all
fit into this knowledge map.

00:09:52.874 --> 00:09:55.993
That top node right there,
that's literally single-digit addition,

00:09:56.017 --> 00:09:58.292
it's like one plus one is equal to two.

00:09:58.316 --> 00:10:00.668
The paradigm is, once you get
10 in a row on that,

00:10:00.692 --> 00:10:03.875
it keeps forwarding you
to more and more advanced modules.

00:10:03.899 --> 00:10:06.978
Further down the knowledge map,

00:10:07.002 --> 00:10:09.249
we're getting into more
advanced arithmetic.

00:10:09.273 --> 00:10:12.446
Further down, you start getting
into pre-algebra and early algebra.

00:10:12.470 --> 00:10:16.213
Further down, you start getting
into algebra one, algebra two,

00:10:16.237 --> 00:10:17.769
a little bit of precalculus.

00:10:18.142 --> 00:10:21.339
And the idea is, from this we can
actually teach everything --

00:10:21.363 --> 00:10:25.205
well, everything that can be taught
in this type of a framework.

00:10:25.229 --> 00:10:28.038
So you can imagine -- and this
is what we are working on --

00:10:28.062 --> 00:10:31.625
from this knowledge map, you have
logic, you have computer programming,

00:10:31.649 --> 00:10:34.149
you have grammar, you have genetics,

00:10:34.173 --> 00:10:37.332
all based off of that core of,
if you know this and that,

00:10:37.356 --> 00:10:39.696
now you're ready for this next concept.

00:10:40.609 --> 00:10:42.911
Now that can work well
for an individual learner,

00:10:42.935 --> 00:10:45.067
and I encourage you
to do it with your kids,

00:10:45.091 --> 00:10:48.130
but I also encourage everyone
in the audience to do it yourself.

00:10:48.154 --> 00:10:50.356
It'll change what happens
at the dinner table.

00:10:50.380 --> 00:10:51.536
But what we want to do

00:10:51.560 --> 00:10:54.638
is use the natural conclusion
of the flipping of the classroom

00:10:54.662 --> 00:10:57.035
that those early teachers
had emailed me about.

00:10:57.059 --> 00:10:58.652
And so what I'm showing you here,

00:10:58.676 --> 00:11:01.564
this is data from a pilot
in the Los Altos school district,

00:11:01.588 --> 00:11:04.904
where they took two fifth-grade classes
and two seventh-grade classes,

00:11:04.928 --> 00:11:07.179
and completely gutted
their old math curriculum.

00:11:07.203 --> 00:11:10.638
These kids aren't using textbooks,
or getting one-size-fits-all lectures.

00:11:10.662 --> 00:11:14.655
They're doing Khan Academy, that software,
for roughly half of their math class.

00:11:14.679 --> 00:11:17.886
I want to be clear: we don't view this
as a complete math education.

00:11:17.910 --> 00:11:20.808
What it does is -- this is
what's happening in Los Altos --

00:11:20.832 --> 00:11:23.233
it frees up time --
it's the blocking and tackling,

00:11:23.257 --> 00:11:26.233
making sure you know how to move
through a system of equations,

00:11:26.257 --> 00:11:28.892
and it frees up time
for the simulations, for the games,

00:11:28.916 --> 00:11:30.932
for the mechanics, for the robot-building,

00:11:30.956 --> 00:11:33.838
for the estimating how high
that hill is based on its shadow.

00:11:33.862 --> 00:11:36.418
And so the paradigm is
the teacher walks in every day,

00:11:36.442 --> 00:11:38.220
every kid works at their own pace --

00:11:38.244 --> 00:11:41.775
this is actually a live dashboard
from the Los Altos school district --

00:11:41.799 --> 00:11:43.370
and they look at this dashboard.

00:11:43.394 --> 00:11:45.084
Every row is a student.

00:11:45.108 --> 00:11:46.976
Every column is one of those concepts.

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.143
Green means the student's
already proficient.

00:11:49.167 --> 00:11:51.691
Blue means they're working
on it -- no need to worry.

00:11:51.715 --> 00:11:52.976
Red means they're stuck.

00:11:53.428 --> 00:11:56.673
And what the teacher does
is literally just say,

00:11:56.697 --> 00:11:58.372
"Let me intervene on the red kids."

00:11:58.396 --> 00:12:00.761
Or even better, "Let me get
one of the green kids,

00:12:00.785 --> 00:12:02.831
who are already proficient
in that concept,

00:12:02.855 --> 00:12:06.368
to be the first line of attack,
and actually tutor their peer."

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:13.601
(Applause)

00:12:13.625 --> 00:12:16.976
Now, I come from a very
data-centric reality,

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:19.739
so we don't want that teacher
to even go and intervene

00:12:19.763 --> 00:12:21.809
and have to ask the kid awkward questions:

00:12:21.833 --> 00:12:25.143
"What don't you understand? What do
you understand?" and all the rest.

00:12:25.167 --> 00:12:28.402
So our paradigm is to arm teachers
with as much data as possible --

00:12:28.426 --> 00:12:30.476
data that, in any other
field, is expected,

00:12:30.500 --> 00:12:32.539
in finance, marketing, manufacturing --

00:12:32.563 --> 00:12:35.360
so the teachers can diagnose
what's wrong with the students

00:12:35.384 --> 00:12:38.272
so they can make their interaction
as productive as possible.

00:12:38.296 --> 00:12:41.130
Now teachers know exactly
what the students have been up to,

00:12:41.154 --> 00:12:44.039
how long they've spent each day,
what videos they've watched,

00:12:44.063 --> 00:12:46.897
when did they pause the videos,
what did they stop watching,

00:12:46.921 --> 00:12:49.644
what exercises are they using,
what have they focused on?

00:12:49.668 --> 00:12:52.541
The outer circle shows
what exercises they were focused on.

00:12:52.565 --> 00:12:55.270
The inner circle shows
the videos they're focused on.

00:12:55.881 --> 00:12:57.318
The data gets pretty granular,

00:12:57.342 --> 00:13:00.429
so you can see the exact problems
the student got right or wrong.

00:13:00.453 --> 00:13:02.182
Red is wrong, blue is right.

00:13:02.206 --> 00:13:05.180
The leftmost question is the first one
the student attempted.

00:13:05.204 --> 00:13:06.846
They watched the video over there.

00:13:06.870 --> 00:13:09.814
And you can see, eventually
they were able to get 10 in a row.

00:13:09.838 --> 00:13:13.193
It's almost like you can see them
learning over those last 10 problems.

00:13:13.217 --> 00:13:16.304
They also got faster -- the height
is how long it took them.

00:13:18.221 --> 00:13:22.720
When you talk about self-paced learning,
it makes sense for everyone --

00:13:22.744 --> 00:13:25.165
in education-speak,
"differentiated learning" --

00:13:25.189 --> 00:13:28.871
but it's kind of crazy, what happens
when you see it in a classroom.

00:13:28.895 --> 00:13:33.339
Because every time we've done this,
in every classroom we've done,

00:13:33.363 --> 00:13:35.687
over and over again,
if you go five days into it,

00:13:35.711 --> 00:13:37.724
there's a group of kids who've raced ahead

00:13:37.748 --> 00:13:39.661
and a group who are a little bit slower.

00:13:39.685 --> 00:13:42.088
In a traditional model,
in a snapshot assessment,

00:13:42.112 --> 00:13:45.024
you say, "These are the gifted kids,
these are the slow kids.

00:13:45.048 --> 00:13:47.016
Maybe they should be tracked differently.

00:13:47.040 --> 00:13:49.270
Maybe we should put them
in different classes."

00:13:49.294 --> 00:13:51.698
But when you let students
work at their own pace --

00:13:51.722 --> 00:13:53.323
we see it over and over again --

00:13:53.347 --> 00:13:55.772
you see students who took
a little bit extra time

00:13:55.796 --> 00:13:57.647
on one concept or the other,

00:13:57.671 --> 00:13:59.867
but once they get through that concept,

00:13:59.891 --> 00:14:01.239
they just race ahead.

00:14:01.263 --> 00:14:04.635
And so the same kids that you
thought were slow six weeks ago,

00:14:04.659 --> 00:14:06.318
you now would think are gifted.

00:14:06.342 --> 00:14:08.334
And we're seeing it over and over again.

00:14:08.358 --> 00:14:10.143
It makes you really wonder

00:14:10.167 --> 00:14:13.466
how much all of the labels maybe
a lot of us have benefited from

00:14:13.490 --> 00:14:16.072
were really just due
to a coincidence of time.

00:14:19.227 --> 00:14:24.259
Now as valuable as something like this is
in a district like Los Altos,

00:14:24.283 --> 00:14:25.976
our goal is to use technology

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.976
to humanize, not just in Los Altos,
but on a global scale,

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:31.503
what's happening in education.

00:14:31.527 --> 00:14:33.828
And that brings up an interesting point.

00:14:33.852 --> 00:14:36.582
A lot of the effort
in humanizing the classroom

00:14:36.606 --> 00:14:39.526
is focused on student-to-teacher ratios.

00:14:39.550 --> 00:14:42.049
In our mind, the relevant metric is:

00:14:42.073 --> 00:14:45.975
student-to-valuable-human-time-
with-the-teacher ratio.

00:14:45.999 --> 00:14:48.524
So in a traditional model,
most of the teacher's time

00:14:48.548 --> 00:14:50.920
is spent doing lectures
and grading and whatnot.

00:14:50.944 --> 00:14:53.840
Maybe five percent of their time
is sitting next to students

00:14:53.864 --> 00:14:55.024
and working with them.

00:14:55.048 --> 00:14:57.055
Now, 100 percent of their time is.

00:14:57.079 --> 00:15:00.349
So once again, using technology,
not just flipping the classroom,

00:15:00.373 --> 00:15:02.731
you're humanizing
the classroom, I'd argue,

00:15:02.755 --> 00:15:04.769
by a factor of five or 10.

00:15:05.396 --> 00:15:07.126
As valuable as that is in Los Altos,

00:15:07.150 --> 00:15:09.191
imagine what it does to the adult learner,

00:15:09.215 --> 00:15:11.278
who's embarrassed to go back
and learn stuff

00:15:11.302 --> 00:15:13.754
they should have known
before going back to college.

00:15:13.778 --> 00:15:19.711
Imagine what it does
to a street kid in Calcutta,

00:15:19.735 --> 00:15:22.477
who has to help his family during the day,

00:15:22.501 --> 00:15:24.907
and that's the reason
he or she can't go to school.

00:15:24.931 --> 00:15:27.414
Now they can spend two hours
a day and remediate,

00:15:27.438 --> 00:15:29.763
or get up to speed
and not feel embarrassed

00:15:29.787 --> 00:15:31.976
about what they do or don't know.

00:15:32.406 --> 00:15:34.034
Now imagine what happens where --

00:15:34.058 --> 00:15:36.969
we talked about the peers
teaching each other

00:15:36.993 --> 00:15:38.802
inside of a classroom.

00:15:38.826 --> 00:15:40.556
But this is all one system.

00:15:40.580 --> 00:15:43.882
There's no reason why you can't
have that peer-to-peer tutoring

00:15:43.906 --> 00:15:45.976
beyond that one classroom.

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:48.976
Imagine what happens
if that student in Calcutta

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:51.168
all of the sudden can tutor your son,

00:15:51.192 --> 00:15:53.653
or your son can tutor
that kid in Calcutta.

00:15:54.121 --> 00:15:55.976
And I think what you'll see emerging

00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:01.903
is this notion of a global
one-world classroom.

00:16:02.602 --> 00:16:05.976
And that's essentially
what we're trying to build.

00:16:06.562 --> 00:16:07.714
Thank you.

00:16:07.738 --> 00:16:14.649
(Applause)

00:16:15.960 --> 00:16:18.396
Bill Gates: I'll ask about two
or three questions.

00:16:18.420 --> 00:16:20.142
Salman Khan: Oh, OK.

00:16:20.166 --> 00:16:21.499
(Applause continues)

00:16:47.711 --> 00:16:49.060
(Applause ends)

00:16:49.084 --> 00:16:52.020
BG: I've seen some things
you're doing in the system,

00:16:52.044 --> 00:16:54.481
that have to do with motivation
and feedback --

00:16:54.505 --> 00:16:56.976
energy points, merit badges.

00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:59.031
Tell me what you're thinking there.

00:16:59.055 --> 00:17:01.651
SK: Oh yeah. No, we have
an awesome team working on it.

00:17:01.675 --> 00:17:03.778
I have to be clear,
it's not just me anymore.

00:17:03.802 --> 00:17:05.287
I'm still doing all the videos,

00:17:05.311 --> 00:17:07.613
but we have a rock-star team
doing the software.

00:17:07.637 --> 00:17:10.796
We've put a bunch of game mechanics
in there, where you get badges,

00:17:10.820 --> 00:17:14.079
we're going to start having leader boards
by area, you get points.

00:17:14.103 --> 00:17:15.929
It's actually been pretty interesting.

00:17:15.953 --> 00:17:17.512
Just the wording of the badging,

00:17:17.536 --> 00:17:19.743
or how many points you get
for doing something,

00:17:19.767 --> 00:17:21.404
we see on a system-wide basis,

00:17:21.428 --> 00:17:24.066
like tens of thousands
of fifth-graders or sixth-graders

00:17:24.090 --> 00:17:27.265
going one direction or another,
depending what badge you give them.

00:17:27.289 --> 00:17:29.352
(Laughter)

00:17:29.376 --> 00:17:31.976
BG: And the collaboration
you're doing with Los Altos,

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:34.177
how did that come about?

00:17:34.201 --> 00:17:37.240
SK: Los Altos, it was kind of crazy.

00:17:37.264 --> 00:17:40.073
Once again, I didn't expect it
to be used in classrooms.

00:17:40.097 --> 00:17:41.976
Someone from their board came and said,

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:44.827
"What would you do if you had
carte Blanche in a classroom?"

00:17:44.851 --> 00:17:47.867
I said, "Well, every student
would work at their own pace,

00:17:47.891 --> 00:17:50.088
on something like this,
we'd give a dashboard."

00:17:50.112 --> 00:17:53.311
They said, "This is kind of radical.
We have to think about it."

00:17:53.335 --> 00:17:57.137
Me and the rest of the team were like,
"They're never going to want to do this."

00:17:57.161 --> 00:18:00.582
But literally the next day they were like,
"Can you start in two weeks?"

00:18:00.606 --> 00:18:02.057
(Laughter)

00:18:02.081 --> 00:18:04.978
BG: So fifth-grade math
is where that's going on right now?

00:18:05.002 --> 00:18:08.001
SK: It's two fifth-grade classes
and two seventh-grade classes.

00:18:08.025 --> 00:18:09.891
They're doing it at the district level.

00:18:09.915 --> 00:18:12.987
I think what they're excited about
is they can follow these kids,

00:18:13.011 --> 00:18:16.424
not only in school; on Christmas,
we saw some of the kids were doing it.

00:18:16.448 --> 00:18:19.976
We can track everything, track them
as they go through the entire district.

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:22.928
Through the summers, as they go
from one teacher to the next,

00:18:22.952 --> 00:18:26.752
you have this continuity of data that
even at the district level, they can see.

00:18:26.776 --> 00:18:29.976
BG: So some of those views we saw
were for the teacher

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:33.691
to go in and track actually
what's going on with those kids.

00:18:33.715 --> 00:18:36.041
So you're getting feedback
on those teacher views

00:18:36.065 --> 00:18:37.778
to see what they think they need?

00:18:37.802 --> 00:18:42.158
SK: Oh yeah. Most of those
were specs by the teachers.

00:18:42.182 --> 00:18:45.192
We made some of those for students
so they could see their data,

00:18:45.216 --> 00:18:48.328
but we have a very tight design loop
with the teachers themselves.

00:18:48.352 --> 00:18:50.576
And they're saying,
"Hey, this is nice, but --"

00:18:50.600 --> 00:18:52.989
Like that focus graph,
a lot of the teachers said,

00:18:53.013 --> 00:18:55.553
"I have a feeling a lot of the kids
are jumping around

00:18:55.577 --> 00:18:57.179
and not focusing on one topic."

00:18:57.203 --> 00:18:58.676
So we made that focus diagram.

00:18:58.700 --> 00:19:01.340
So it's all been teacher-driven.
It's been pretty crazy.

00:19:01.364 --> 00:19:02.937
BG: Is this ready for prime time?

00:19:02.961 --> 00:19:07.315
Do you think a lot of classes next school
year should try this thing out?

00:19:07.339 --> 00:19:08.497
SK: Yeah, it's ready.

00:19:08.521 --> 00:19:11.239
We've got a million people
on the site already,

00:19:11.263 --> 00:19:14.195
so we can handle a few more.

00:19:14.219 --> 00:19:15.976
(Laughter)

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:17.976
No, no reason why it really can't happen

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:20.610
in every classroom in America tomorrow.

00:19:20.634 --> 00:19:23.114
BG: And the vision of the tutoring thing.

00:19:23.138 --> 00:19:25.976
The idea there is,
if I'm confused about a topic,

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:28.152
somehow right in the user interface,

00:19:28.176 --> 00:19:30.312
I'd find people who are volunteering,

00:19:30.336 --> 00:19:32.074
maybe see their reputation,

00:19:32.098 --> 00:19:35.275
and I could schedule and connect up
with those people?

00:19:35.299 --> 00:19:39.048
SK: Absolutely. And this is something
I recommend everyone in this audience do.

00:19:39.072 --> 00:19:42.134
Those dashboards the teachers have,
you can go log in right now

00:19:42.158 --> 00:19:43.976
and you can essentially become a coach

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:46.976
for your kids, your nephews, your cousins,

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:49.829
or maybe some kids
at the Boys and Girls Club.

00:19:49.853 --> 00:19:52.385
And yeah, you can start
becoming a mentor, a tutor,

00:19:52.409 --> 00:19:53.881
really immediately.

00:19:53.905 --> 00:19:55.298
But yeah, it's all there.

00:19:55.890 --> 00:19:57.048
BG: Well, it's amazing.

00:19:57.072 --> 00:20:00.134
I think you just got a glimpse
of the future of education.

00:20:00.158 --> 00:20:01.976
BG: Thank you.
SK: Thank you.

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:05.722
(Applause)
