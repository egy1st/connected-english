00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:04.539
This is a river.

00:00:05.857 --> 00:00:07.198
This is a stream.

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:09.674
This is a river.

00:00:10.744 --> 00:00:12.769
This is happening all over the country.

00:00:13.355 --> 00:00:17.849
There are tens of thousands of miles
of dewatered streams in the United States.

00:00:18.256 --> 00:00:23.005
On this map, the colored areas
represent water conflicts.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.966
Similar problems
are emerging in the East as well.

00:00:27.791 --> 00:00:31.169
The reasons vary state to state,
but mostly in the details.

00:00:31.907 --> 00:00:36.609
There are 4,000 miles
of dewatered streams in Montana alone.

00:00:37.655 --> 00:00:40.745
They would ordinarily
support fish and other wildlife.

00:00:41.245 --> 00:00:44.205
They're the veins of the ecosystem,

00:00:44.229 --> 00:00:46.052
and they're often empty veins.

00:00:47.964 --> 00:00:51.211
I want to tell you the story
of just one of these streams,

00:00:51.235 --> 00:00:54.675
because it's an archetype
for the larger story.

00:00:54.699 --> 00:00:56.439
This is Prickly Pear Creek.

00:00:56.463 --> 00:01:00.988
It runs through a populated area
from East Helena to Lake Helena.

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:07.592
It supports wild fish including cutthroat,
brown and rainbow trout.

00:01:07.616 --> 00:01:11.588
Nearly every year
for more than a hundred years ...

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:15.319
it looked like this in the summer.

00:01:15.343 --> 00:01:16.603
How did we get here?

00:01:17.827 --> 00:01:21.002
Well, it started back in the late 1800s

00:01:21.026 --> 00:01:23.976
when people started settling
in places like Montana.

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:28.142
In short, there was a lot of water
and there weren't very many people.

00:01:29.091 --> 00:01:31.101
But as more people
showed up wanting water,

00:01:31.125 --> 00:01:34.078
the folks who were there first
got a little concerned,

00:01:34.102 --> 00:01:38.040
and in 1865, Montana passed
its first water law.

00:01:38.754 --> 00:01:42.771
It basically said, everybody
near the stream can share in the stream.

00:01:43.309 --> 00:01:46.267
Oddly, a lot of people showed up
wanting to share the stream,

00:01:46.291 --> 00:01:47.918
and the folks who were there first

00:01:47.942 --> 00:01:50.286
got concerned enough
to bring out their lawyers.

00:01:50.634 --> 00:01:54.101
There were precedent-setting suits
in 1870 and 1872,

00:01:54.125 --> 00:01:56.313
both involving Prickly Pear Creek.

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:57.976
And in 1921,

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:03.075
the Montana Supreme Court
ruled in a case involving Prickly Pear

00:02:03.099 --> 00:02:08.694
that the folks who were there first
had the first, or "senior water rights."

00:02:09.564 --> 00:02:12.186
These senior water rights are key.

00:02:12.806 --> 00:02:16.641
The problem is that all over the West
now it looks like this.

00:02:16.665 --> 00:02:18.446
Some of these creeks have claims

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:22.768
for 50 to 100 times more water
than is actually in the stream.

00:02:23.308 --> 00:02:28.154
And the senior water rights holders,
if they don't use their water right,

00:02:28.178 --> 00:02:30.328
they risk losing their water right --

00:02:31.073 --> 00:02:33.750
along with the economic value
that goes with it.

00:02:33.774 --> 00:02:36.436
So they have no incentive to conserve.

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:39.682
So it's not just
about the number of people;

00:02:40.521 --> 00:02:43.910
the system itself creates
a disincentive to conserve

00:02:43.934 --> 00:02:47.031
because you can lose your water
right if you don't use it.

00:02:48.299 --> 00:02:52.294
So after decades of lawsuits
and 140 years, now, of experience,

00:02:52.318 --> 00:02:54.000
we still have this.

00:02:55.843 --> 00:02:57.620
It's a broken system.

00:02:57.644 --> 00:02:59.644
There's a disincentive to conserve,

00:02:59.668 --> 00:03:03.259
because if you don't use your water right,
you can lose your water right.

00:03:03.283 --> 00:03:06.512
And I'm sure you all know,
this has created significant conflicts

00:03:06.536 --> 00:03:09.589
between the agricultural
and environmental communities.

00:03:10.551 --> 00:03:12.976
OK, now I'm going to change gears here.

00:03:13.965 --> 00:03:17.710
Most of you will be happy to know that
the rest of the presentation's free ...

00:03:17.734 --> 00:03:18.761
(Laughter)

00:03:18.785 --> 00:03:21.569
and some of you'll be happy
to know that it involves beer.

00:03:21.593 --> 00:03:24.564
(Laughter)

00:03:24.588 --> 00:03:27.038
There's another thing
happening around the country,

00:03:27.062 --> 00:03:29.553
which is that companies
are starting to get concerned

00:03:29.577 --> 00:03:31.211
about their water footprint.

00:03:31.235 --> 00:03:34.323
They're concerned about securing
an adequate supply of water,

00:03:34.347 --> 00:03:37.230
they're trying to be really efficient
with their water use,

00:03:37.254 --> 00:03:39.466
and they're concerned
about how their water use

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:41.155
affects the image of their brand.

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:43.820
Well, it's a national problem,

00:03:43.844 --> 00:03:46.524
but I'm going to tell you
another story from Montana ...

00:03:46.548 --> 00:03:48.701
and it involves beer.

00:03:48.725 --> 00:03:51.672
I bet you didn't know,
it takes about 5 pints of water

00:03:51.696 --> 00:03:53.309
to make a pint of beer.

00:03:53.333 --> 00:03:55.302
If you include all the drain,

00:03:55.326 --> 00:03:58.877
it takes more than a hundred pints
of water to make a pint of beer.

00:03:58.901 --> 00:04:00.349
Now the brewers in Montana

00:04:00.373 --> 00:04:04.303
have already done a lot
to reduce their water consumption,

00:04:04.327 --> 00:04:06.592
but they still use
millions of gallons of water.

00:04:06.616 --> 00:04:08.846
I mean, there's water in beer.

00:04:10.168 --> 00:04:16.475
So what can they do
about this remaining water footprint

00:04:16.499 --> 00:04:19.735
that can have serious effects
on the ecosystem?

00:04:20.176 --> 00:04:22.464
These ecosystems are really important

00:04:22.488 --> 00:04:24.526
to the Montana brewers
and their customers.

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:28.195
After all, there's a strong correlation
between water and fishing,

00:04:28.219 --> 00:04:32.446
and for some, there's a strong correlation
between fishing and beer.

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:33.977
(Laughter)

00:04:34.001 --> 00:04:37.512
So the Montana brewers
and their customers are concerned

00:04:37.625 --> 00:04:40.302
and they're looking for some way
to address the problem.

00:04:40.326 --> 00:04:43.945
So how can they address
this remaining water footprint?

00:04:43.969 --> 00:04:45.474
Remember Prickly Pear.

00:04:45.498 --> 00:04:49.677
Up until now, business water stewardship

00:04:49.701 --> 00:04:52.976
has been limited
to measuring and reducing,

00:04:53.975 --> 00:04:57.096
and we're suggesting
that the next step is to restore.

00:04:58.123 --> 00:04:59.295
Remember Prickly Pear.

00:04:59.319 --> 00:05:00.543
It's a broken system.

00:05:00.567 --> 00:05:02.610
You've got a disincentive to conserve,

00:05:02.634 --> 00:05:06.379
because if you don't use your water right,
you risk losing your water right.

00:05:06.403 --> 00:05:08.790
Well, we decided to connect
these two worlds --

00:05:08.814 --> 00:05:12.135
the world of the companies
with their water footprints

00:05:12.159 --> 00:05:13.766
and the world of the farmers

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:16.239
with their senior water rights
on these creeks.

00:05:16.263 --> 00:05:17.569
In some states,

00:05:18.324 --> 00:05:22.976
senior water rights holders
can leave their water in the stream

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.154
while legally protecting it from others,

00:05:27.043 --> 00:05:29.709
and maintaining their water right.

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:33.154
After all, it is their water right,

00:05:33.178 --> 00:05:37.277
and if they want to use that water right
to help the fish grow in the stream,

00:05:37.721 --> 00:05:39.308
it's their right to do so.

00:05:40.135 --> 00:05:43.976
But they have no incentive to do so.

00:05:44.802 --> 00:05:50.076
So, working with local water trusts,
we created an incentive to do so.

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:54.252
We pay them to leave
their water in stream.

00:05:54.276 --> 00:05:55.670
That's what's happening here.

00:05:55.694 --> 00:06:00.497
This individual has made the choice
and is closing this water diversion,

00:06:00.521 --> 00:06:02.696
leaving the water in the stream.

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:04.361
He doesn't lose the water right,

00:06:04.385 --> 00:06:09.154
he just chooses to apply that right,
or some portion of it,

00:06:09.178 --> 00:06:11.681
to the stream, instead of to the land.

00:06:12.432 --> 00:06:14.813
Because he's the senior
water-rights holder,

00:06:14.837 --> 00:06:17.976
he can protect the water
from other users in the stream.

00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:20.250
OK?

00:06:20.274 --> 00:06:22.976
He gets paid to leave
the water in the stream.

00:06:24.208 --> 00:06:27.311
This guy's measuring the water
that this leaves in the stream.

00:06:28.565 --> 00:06:31.051
We then take the measured water,

00:06:31.075 --> 00:06:33.730
we divide it into
thousand-gallon increments.

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:37.874
Each increment gets a serial number
and a certificate,

00:06:37.898 --> 00:06:41.286
and then the brewers and others
buy those certificates

00:06:41.310 --> 00:06:45.375
as a way to return water
to these degraded ecosystems.

00:06:45.399 --> 00:06:48.552
The brewers pay
to restore water to the stream.

00:06:50.672 --> 00:06:53.913
It provides a simple,
inexpensive and measurable way

00:06:54.873 --> 00:06:57.583
to return water
to these degraded ecosystems,

00:06:57.607 --> 00:07:00.500
while giving farmers an economic choice

00:07:00.524 --> 00:07:03.408
and giving businesses
concerned about their water footprints

00:07:03.432 --> 00:07:04.976
an easy way to deal with them.

00:07:05.477 --> 00:07:11.547
After 140 years of conflict
and 100 years of dry streams,

00:07:12.316 --> 00:07:16.302
a circumstance that litigation
and regulation has not solved,

00:07:17.787 --> 00:07:21.969
we put together a market-based,
willing buyer, willing seller solution --

00:07:21.993 --> 00:07:24.675
a solution that
does not require litigation.

00:07:26.475 --> 00:07:31.357
It's about giving folks
concerned about their water footprints

00:07:31.381 --> 00:07:35.208
a real opportunity to put water
where it's critically needed,

00:07:35.986 --> 00:07:38.484
into these degraded ecosystems,

00:07:38.508 --> 00:07:44.106
while at the same time providing farmers
a meaningful economic choice

00:07:44.263 --> 00:07:46.172
about how their water is used.

00:07:46.196 --> 00:07:48.879
These transactions
create allies, not enemies.

00:07:48.903 --> 00:07:51.358
They connect people
rather than dividing them.

00:07:51.382 --> 00:07:55.096
And they provide needed economic
support for rural communities.

00:07:55.120 --> 00:07:57.104
And most importantly, it's working.

00:07:57.128 --> 00:08:01.797
We've returned more than four billion
gallons of water to degraded ecosystems.

00:08:01.821 --> 00:08:03.850
We've connected senior
water-rights holders

00:08:03.874 --> 00:08:05.322
with brewers in Montana,

00:08:05.346 --> 00:08:08.058
with hotels and tea companies in Oregon,

00:08:08.082 --> 00:08:11.687
and with high-tech companies
that use a lot of water in the Southwest.

00:08:11.711 --> 00:08:14.099
And when we make these connections,

00:08:14.123 --> 00:08:17.328
we can and we do turn this ...

00:08:17.963 --> 00:08:19.113
into this.

00:08:19.563 --> 00:08:20.933
(Applause)

00:08:20.957 --> 00:08:22.410
Thank you very much.

00:08:22.434 --> 00:08:26.134
(Applause)
