00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
When I got my current job, I was given a good piece of advice,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
which was to interview three politicians every day.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
And from that much contact with politicians,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
I can tell you they're all emotional freaks of one sort or another.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
They have what I called "logorrhea dementia,"

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
which is they talk so much they drive themselves insane.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
(Laughter)

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
But what they do have is incredible social skills.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
When you meet them, they lock into you,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
they look you in the eye,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
they invade your personal space,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
they massage the back of your head.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
I had dinner with a Republican senator several months ago

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
who kept his hand on my inner thigh

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
throughout the whole meal -- squeezing it.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
I once -- this was years ago --

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
I saw Ted Kennedy and Dan Quayle meet in the well of the Senate.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
And they were friends, and they hugged each other

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
and they were laughing, and their faces were like this far apart.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
And they were moving and grinding

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
and moving their arms up and down each other.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
And I was like, "Get a room. I don't want to see this."

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
But they have those social skills.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
Another case:

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
Last election cycle,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
I was following Mitt Romney around New Hampshire,

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
and he was campaigning with his five perfect sons:

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
Bip, Chip, Rip, Zip, Lip and Dip.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
(Laughter)

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
And he's going into a diner.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
And he goes into the diner, introduces himself to a family

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
and says, "What village are you from in New Hampshire?"

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
And then he describes the home he owned in their village.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
And so he goes around the room,

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
and then as he's leaving the diner,

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
he first-names almost everybody he's just met.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
I was like, "Okay, that's social skill."

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
But the paradox is,

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.000
when a lot of these people slip into the policy-making mode,

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
that social awareness vanishes

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
and they start talking like accountants.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
So in the course of my career,

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
I have covered a series of failures.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
We sent economists in the Soviet Union

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
with privatization plans when it broke up,

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
and what they really lacked was social trust.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
We invaded Iraq with a military

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
oblivious to the cultural and psychological realities.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
We had a financial regulatory regime

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
based on the assumptions

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
that traders were rational creatures

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
who wouldn't do anything stupid.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
For 30 years, I've been covering school reform

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
and we've basically reorganized the bureaucratic boxes --

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
charters, private schools, vouchers --

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000
but we've had disappointing results year after year.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000
And the fact is, people learn from people they love.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
And if you're not talking about the individual relationship

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
between a teacher and a student,

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
you're not talking about that reality.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
But that reality is expunged

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
from our policy-making process.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
And so that's led to a question for me:

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000
Why are the most socially-attuned people on earth

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
completely dehumanized

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000
when they think about policy?

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
And I came to the conclusion,

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
this is a symptom of a larger problem.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000
That, for centuries, we've inherited a view of human nature

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
based on the notion

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000
that we're divided selves,

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.000
that reason is separated from the emotions

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
and that society progresses

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
to the extent that reason can suppress the passions.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
And it's led to a view of human nature

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000
that we're rational individuals

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000
who respond in straightforward ways to incentives,

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000
and it's led to ways of seeing the world

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000
where people try to use the assumptions of physics

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.000
to measure how human behavior is.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
And it's produced a great amputation,

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000
a shallow view of human nature.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
We're really good at talking about material things,

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.000
but we're really bad at talking about emotions.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
We're really good at talking about skills

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000
and safety and health;

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000
we're really bad at talking about character.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000
Alasdair MacIntyre, the famous philosopher,

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000
said that, "We have the concepts of the ancient morality

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000
of virtue, honor, goodness,

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000
but we no longer have a system

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000
by which to connect them."

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.000
And so this has led to a shallow path in politics,

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:55.000
but also in a whole range of human endeavors.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.000
You can see it in the way we raise our young kids.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000
You go to an elementary school at three in the afternoon

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000
and you watch the kids come out,

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000
and they're wearing these 80-pound backpacks.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.000
If the wind blows them over, they're like beetles stuck there on the ground.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000
You see these cars that drive up --

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000
usually it's Saabs and Audis and Volvos,

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000
because in certain neighborhoods it's socially acceptable to have a luxury car,

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.000
so long as it comes from a country hostile to U.S. foreign policy --

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000
that's fine.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.000
They get picked up by these creatures I've called uber-moms,

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
who are highly successful career women

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000
who have taken time off to make sure all their kids get into Harvard.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000
And you can usually tell the uber-moms

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000
because they actually weigh less than their own children.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000
(Laughter)

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000
So at the moment of conception,

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000
they're doing little butt exercises.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000
Babies flop out,

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.000
they're flashing Mandarin flashcards at the things.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.000
Driving them home, and they want them to be enlightened,

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000
so they take them to Ben &amp; Jerry's ice cream company

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000
with its own foreign policy.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000
In one of my books,

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000
I joke that Ben &amp; Jerry's should make a pacifist toothpaste --

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000
doesn't kill germs, just asks them to leave.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000
It would be a big seller.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000
(Laughter)

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000
And they go to Whole Foods to get their baby formula,

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000
and Whole Foods is one of those progressive grocery stores

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.000
where all the cashiers look like they're on loan from Amnesty International.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000
(Laughter)

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000
They buy these seaweed-based snacks there

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000
called Veggie Booty with Kale,

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000
which is for kids who come home and say,

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.000
"Mom, mom, I want a snack that'll help prevent colon-rectal cancer."

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000
(Laughter)

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000
And so the kids are raised in a certain way,

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.000
jumping through achievement hoops of the things we can measure --

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.000
SAT prep, oboe, soccer practice.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.000
They get into competitive colleges, they get good jobs,

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000
and sometimes they make a success of themselves

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.000
in a superficial manner, and they make a ton of money.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000
And sometimes you can see them at vacation places

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.000
like Jackson Hole or Aspen.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000
And they've become elegant and slender --

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.000
they don't really have thighs;

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.000
they just have one elegant calve on top of another.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000
(Laughter)

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.000
They have kids of their own,

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.000
and they've achieved a genetic miracle by marrying beautiful people,

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.000
so their grandmoms look like Gertrude Stein,

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.000
their daughters looks like Halle Berry -- I don't know how they've done that.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.000
They get there and they realize

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:11.000
it's fashionable now to have dogs a third as tall as your ceiling heights.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.000
So they've got these furry 160-pound dogs --

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.000
all look like velociraptors,

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.000
all named after Jane Austen characters.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.000
And then when they get old, they haven't really developed a philosophy of life,

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.000
but they've decided, "I've been successful at everything;

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000
I'm just not going to die."

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.000
And so they hire personal trainers;

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000
they're popping Cialis like breath mints.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000
You see them on the mountains up there.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000
They're cross-country skiing up the mountain

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.000
with these grim expressions

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.000
that make Dick Cheney look like Jerry Lewis.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000
(Laughter)

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000
And as they whiz by you,

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.000
it's like being passed by a little iron Raisinet

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.000
going up the hill.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.000
(Laughter)

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.000
And so this is part of what life is,

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.000
but it's not all of what life is.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.000
And over the past few years,

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:02.000
I think we've been given a deeper view of human nature

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000
and a deeper view of who we are.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.000
And it's not based on theology or philosophy,

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.000
it's in the study of the mind,

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.000
across all these spheres of research,

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.000
from neuroscience to the cognitive scientists,

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.000
behavioral economists, psychologists,

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.000
sociology,

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:19.000
we're developing a revolution in consciousness.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.000
And when you synthesize it all,

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.000
it's giving us a new view of human nature.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:26.000
And far from being a coldly materialistic view of nature,

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.000
it's a new humanism, it's a new enchantment.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000
And I think when you synthesize this research,

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.000
you start with three key insights.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.000
The first insight is

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.000
that while the conscious mind writes the autobiography of our species,

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:42.000
the unconscious mind does most of the work.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.000
And so one way to formulate that is

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:47.000
the human mind can take in millions of pieces of information a minute,

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:50.000
of which it can be consciously aware of about 40.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000
And this leads to oddities.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000
One of my favorite is that people named Dennis

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.000
are disproportionately likely to become dentists,

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.000
people named Lawrence become lawyers,

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.000
because unconsciously we gravitate toward things

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.000
that sound familiar,

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.000
which is why I named my daughter President of the United States Brooks.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:09.000
(Laughter)

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:12.000
Another finding is that the unconscious,

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.000
far from being dumb and sexualized,

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.000
is actually quite smart.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:19.000
So one of the most cognitively demanding things we do is buy furniture.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:22.000
It's really hard to imagine a sofa, how it's going to look in your house.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.000
And the way you should do that

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000
is study the furniture,

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000
let it marinate in your mind, distract yourself,

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.000
and then a few days later, go with your gut,

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000
because unconsciously you've figured it out.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.000
The second insight

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:37.000
is that emotions are at the center of our thinking.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.000
People with strokes and lesions

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.000
in the emotion-processing parts of the brain

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.000
are not super smart,

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.000
they're actually sometimes quite helpless.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.000
And the "giant" in the field is in the room tonight

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:50.000
and is speaking tomorrow morning -- Antonio Damasio.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.000
And one of the things he's really shown us

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:55.000
is that emotions are not separate from reason,

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.000
but they are the foundation of reason

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.000
because they tell us what to value.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.000
And so reading and educating your emotions

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:04.000
is one of the central activities of wisdom.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.000
Now I'm a middle-aged guy.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.000
I'm not exactly comfortable with emotions.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:11.000
One of my favorite brain stories described these middle-aged guys.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:14.000
They put them into a brain scan machine --

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:17.000
this is apocryphal by the way, but I don't care --

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:20.000
and they had them watch a horror movie,

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:24.000
and then they had them describe their feelings toward their wives.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:27.000
And the brain scans were identical in both activities.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.000
It was just sheer terror.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.000
So me talking about emotion

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.000
is like Gandhi talking about gluttony,

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.000
but it is the central organizing process

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.000
of the way we think.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.000
It tells us what to imprint.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.000
The brain is the record of the feelings of a life.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.000
And the third insight

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:47.000
is that we're not primarily self-contained individuals.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:50.000
We're social animals, not rational animals.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.000
We emerge out of relationships,

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:55.000
and we are deeply interpenetrated, one with another.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.000
And so when we see another person,

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.000
we reenact in our own minds

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.000
what we see in their minds.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.000
When we watch a car chase in a movie,

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:06.000
it's almost as if we are subtly having a car chase.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.000
When we watch pornography,

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.000
it's a little like having sex,

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.000
though probably not as good.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:15.000
And we see this when lovers walk down the street,

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:17.000
when a crowd in Egypt or Tunisia

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.000
gets caught up in an emotional contagion,

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.000
the deep interpenetration.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:24.000
And this revolution in who we are

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:27.000
gives us a different way of seeing, I think, politics,

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.000
a different way, most importantly,

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.000
of seeing human capital.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:35.000
We are now children of the French Enlightenment.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:38.000
We believe that reason is the highest of the faculties.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.000
But I think this research shows

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.000
that the British Enlightenment, or the Scottish Enlightenment,

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.000
with David Hume, Adam Smith,

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:47.000
actually had a better handle on who we are --

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:50.000
that reason is often weak, our sentiments are strong,

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:53.000
and our sentiments are often trustworthy.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:56.000
And this work corrects that bias in our culture,

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.000
that dehumanizing bias.

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.000
It gives us a deeper sense

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.000
of what it actually takes

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:04.000
for us to thrive in this life.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:06.000
When we think about human capital

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:09.000
we think about the things we can measure easily --

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:12.000
things like grades, SAT's, degrees,

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.000
the number of years in schooling.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:17.000
What it really takes to do well, to lead a meaningful life,

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.000
are things that are deeper,

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:22.000
things we don't really even have words for.

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.000
And so let me list just a couple of the things

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:28.000
I think this research points us toward trying to understand.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:31.000
The first gift, or talent, is mindsight --

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:35.000
the ability to enter into other people's minds

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:37.000
and learn what they have to offer.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.000
Babies come with this ability.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.000
Meltzoff, who's at the University of Washington,

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:44.000
leaned over a baby who was 43 minutes old.

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:46.000
He wagged his tongue at the baby.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:49.000
The baby wagged her tongue back.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:52.000
Babies are born to interpenetrate into Mom's mind

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.000
and to download what they find --

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.000
their models of how to understand reality.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:59.000
In the United States, 55 percent of babies

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.000
have a deep two-way conversation with Mom

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:04.000
and they learn models to how to relate to other people.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.000
And those people who have models of how to relate

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.000
have a huge head start in life.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.000
Scientists at the University of Minnesota did a study

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.000
in which they could predict

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:15.000
with 77 percent accuracy, at age 18 months,

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:17.000
who was going to graduate from high school,

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:20.000
based on who had good attachment with mom.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:23.000
Twenty percent of kids do not have those relationships.

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:25.000
They are what we call avoidantly attached.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.000
They have trouble relating to other people.

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:29.000
They go through life

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:31.000
like sailboats tacking into the wind --

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:33.000
wanting to get close to people,

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:36.000
but not really having the models of how to do that.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.000
And so this is one skill

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.000
of how to hoover up knowledge, one from another.

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:43.000
A second skill is equipoise,

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:45.000
the ability to have the serenity

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:48.000
to read the biases and failures in your own mind.

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:51.000
So for example, we are overconfidence machines.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:54.000
Ninety-five percent of our professors report

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.000
that they are above-average teachers.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.000
Ninety-six percent of college students

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:01.000
say they have above-average social skills.

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:04.000
Time magazine asked Americans, "Are you in the top one percent of earners?"

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:07.000
Nineteen percent of Americans are in the top one percent of earners.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:09.000
(Laughter)

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:11.000
This is a gender-linked trait, by the way.

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:13.000
Men drown at twice the rate of women,

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:16.000
because men think they can swim across that lake.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:19.000
But some people have the ability and awareness

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:22.000
of their own biases, their own overconfidence.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.000
They have epistemological modesty.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:27.000
They are open-minded in the face of ambiguity.

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:29.000
They are able to adjust strength of the conclusions

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:31.000
to the strength of their evidence.

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.000
They are curious.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:36.000
And these traits are often unrelated and uncorrelated with IQ.

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.000
The third trait is metis,

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:41.000
what we might call street smarts -- it's a Greek word.

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:43.000
It's a sensitivity to the physical environment,

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:45.000
the ability to pick out patterns in an environment --

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.000
derive a gist.

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:49.000
One of my colleagues at the Times

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:51.000
did a great story about soldiers in Iraq

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:54.000
who could look down a street and detect somehow

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.000
whether there was an IED, a landmine, in the street.

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:58.000
They couldn't tell you how they did it,

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:01.000
but they could feel cold, they felt a coldness,

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:04.000
and they were more often right than wrong.

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:06.000
The third is what you might call sympathy,

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:09.000
the ability to work within groups.

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:12.000
And that comes in tremendously handy,

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:14.000
because groups are smarter than individuals.

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.000
And face-to-face groups are much smarter

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:19.000
than groups that communicate electronically,

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:22.000
because 90 percent of our communication is non-verbal.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:24.000
And the effectiveness of a group

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:27.000
is not determined by the IQ of the group;

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:30.000
it's determined by how well they communicate,

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:33.000
how often they take turns in conversation.

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:36.000
Then you could talk about a trait like blending.

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:39.000
Any child can say, "I'm a tiger," pretend to be a tiger.

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:41.000
It seems so elementary.

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:43.000
But in fact, it's phenomenally complicated

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:45.000
to take a concept "I" and a concept "tiger"

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:47.000
and blend them together.

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:49.000
But this is the source of innovation.

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:51.000
What Picasso did, for example,

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:53.000
was take the concept "Western art"

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:55.000
and the concept "African masks"

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:57.000
and blend them together --

00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:59.000
not only the geometry,

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:01.000
but the moral systems entailed in them.

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.000
And these are skills, again, we can't count and measure.

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:05.000
And then the final thing I'll mention

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:07.000
is something you might call limerence.

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:09.000
And this is not an ability;

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:12.000
it's a drive and a motivation.

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:15.000
The conscious mind hungers for success and prestige.

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:17.000
The unconscious mind hungers

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:19.000
for those moments of transcendence,

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:21.000
when the skull line disappears

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:24.000
and we are lost in a challenge or a task --

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:27.000
when a craftsman feels lost in his craft,

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:30.000
when a naturalist feels at one with nature,

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:33.000
when a believer feels at one with God's love.

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:36.000
That is what the unconscious mind hungers for.

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:38.000
And many of us feel it in love

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:40.000
when lovers feel fused.

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:42.000
And one of the most beautiful descriptions

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:45.000
I've come across in this research

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:47.000
of how minds interpenetrate

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:49.000
was written by a great theorist and scientist

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:52.000
named Douglas Hofstadter at the University of Indiana.

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:54.000
He was married to a woman named Carol,

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:56.000
and they had a wonderful relationship.

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:58.000
When their kids were five and two,

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:02.000
Carol had a stroke and a brain tumor and died suddenly.

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:04.000
And Hofstadter wrote a book

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:06.000
called "I Am a Strange Loop."

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:08.000
In the course of that book, he describes a moment --

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:11.000
just months after Carol has died --

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:13.000
he comes across her picture on the mantel,

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:15.000
or on a bureau in his bedroom.

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:17.000
And here's what he wrote:

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:19.000
"I looked at her face,

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:21.000
and I looked so deeply

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:23.000
that I felt I was behind her eyes.

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:25.000
And all at once I found myself saying

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:27.000
as tears flowed,

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:29.000
'That's me. That's me.'

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:31.000
And those simple words

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:33.000
brought back many thoughts that I had had before,

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:35.000
about the fusion of our souls

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:37.000
into one higher-level entity,

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:40.000
about the fact that at the core of both our souls

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:44.000
lay our identical hopes and dreams for our children,

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:46.000
about the notion that those hopes

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:48.000
were not separate or distinct hopes,

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:50.000
but were just one hope,

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:52.000
one clear thing that defined us both,

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:54.000
that welded us into a unit --

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:57.000
the kind of unit I had but dimly imagined

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:00.000
before being married and having children.

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:02.000
I realized that, though Carol had died,

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:05.000
that core piece of her had not died at all,

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:09.000
but had lived on very determinedly in my brain."

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:12.000
The Greeks say we suffer our way to wisdom.

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:14.000
Through his suffering, Hofstadter understood

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:17.000
how deeply interpenetrated we are.

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:20.000
Through the policy failures of the last 30 years,

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:23.000
we have come to acknowledge, I think,

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:26.000
how shallow our view of human nature has been.

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:29.000
And now as we confront that shallowness

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:31.000
and the failures that derive from our inability

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:33.000
to get the depths of who we are,

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:35.000
comes this revolution in consciousness --

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:38.000
these people in so many fields

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:40.000
exploring the depth of our nature

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:42.000
and coming away with this enchanted,

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:44.000
this new humanism.

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:46.000
And when Freud discovered his sense of the unconscious,

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:49.000
it had a vast effect on the climate of the times.

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:52.000
Now we are discovering a more accurate vision

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:55.000
of the unconscious, of who we are deep inside,

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:57.000
and it's going to have a wonderful and profound

00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:59.000
and humanizing effect on our culture.

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:01.000
Thank you.

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:21.000
