00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
I want to ask you all to consider for a second

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
the very simple fact

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
that, by far,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
most of what we know about the universe

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
comes to us from light.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
We can stand on the Earth and look up at the night sky

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
and see stars with our bare eyes.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
The Sun burns our peripheral vision.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
We see light reflected off the Moon.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
And in the time since Galileo pointed that rudimentary telescope

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
at the celestial bodies,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
the known universe has come to us through light,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
across vast eras in cosmic history.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
And with all of our modern telescopes,

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
we've been able to collect

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
this stunning silent movie of the universe --

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
these series of snapshots

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
that go all the way back to the Big Bang.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
And yet, the universe is not a silent movie

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
because the universe isn't silent.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
I'd like to convince you

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
that the universe has a soundtrack

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000
and that soundtrack is played on space itself,

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
because space can wobble like a drum.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
It can ring out a kind of recording

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
throughout the universe

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
of some of the most dramatic events as they unfold.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
Now we'd like to be able to add

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
to a kind of glorious visual composition

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
that we have of the universe --

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
a sonic composition.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.000
And while we've never heard the sounds from space,

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
we really should, in the next few years,

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
start to turn up the volume on what's going on out there.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
So in this ambition

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
to capture songs from the universe,

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
we turn our focus

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
to black holes and the promise they have,

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
because black holes can bang on space-time

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
like mallets on a drum

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
and have a very characteristic song,

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
which I'd like to play for you -- some of our predictions

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
for what that song will be like.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
Now black holes are dark against a dark sky.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
We can't see them directly.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
They're not brought to us with light, at least not directly.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
We can see them indirectly,

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
because black holes wreak havoc on their environment.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
They destroy stars around them.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000
They churn up debris in their surroundings.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
But they won't come to us directly through light.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
We might one day see a shadow

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
a black hole can cast on a very bright background,

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
but we haven't yet.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
And yet black holes may be heard

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
even if they're not seen,

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.000
and that's because they bang on space-time like a drum.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000
Now we owe the idea that space can ring like a drum

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000
to Albert Einstein -- to whom we owe so much.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
Einstein realized that if space were empty,

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
if the universe were empty,

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000
it would be like this picture,

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000
except for maybe without the helpful grid drawn on it.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000
But if we were freely falling through the space,

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
even without this helpful grid,

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
we might be able to paint it ourselves,

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
because we would notice that we traveled along straight lines,

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
undeflected straight paths

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
through the universe.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
Einstein also realized --

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
and this is the real meat of the matter --

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000
that if you put energy or mass in the universe,

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000
it would curve space,

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
and a freely falling object

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
would pass by, let's say, the Sun

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000
and it would be deflected

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
along the natural curves in the space.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.000
It was Einstein's great general theory of relativity.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000
Now even light will be bent by those paths.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
And you can be bent so much

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
that you're caught in orbit around the Sun,

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
as the Earth is, or the Moon around the Earth.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.000
These are the natural curves in space.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000
What Einstein did not realize

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000
was that, if you took our Sun

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000
and you crushed it down to six kilometers --

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.000
so you took a million times the mass of the Earth

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.000
and you crushed it to six kilometers across,

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000
you would make a black hole,

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000
an object so dense

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.000
that if light veered too close, it would never escape --

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000
a dark shadow against the universe.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000
It wasn't Einstein who realized this,

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000
it was Karl Schwarzschild

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000
who was a German Jew in World War I --

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000
joined the German army already an accomplished scientist,

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000
working on the Russian front.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000
I like to imagine Schwarzschild in the war in the trenches

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:13.000
calculating ballistic trajectories for cannon fire,

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000
and then, in between,

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000
calculating Einstein's equations --

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000
as you do in the trenches.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000
And he was reading Einstein's recently published

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000
general theory of relativity,

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.000
and he was thrilled by this theory.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000
And he quickly surmised

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000
an exact mathematical solution

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000
that described something very extraordinary:

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000
curves so strong

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000
that space would rain down into them,

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000
space itself would curve like a waterfall

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000
flowing down the throat of a hole.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.000
And even light could not escape this current.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000
Light would be dragged down the hole

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000
as everything else would be,

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000
and all that would be left would be a shadow.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000
Now he wrote to Einstein,

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000
and he said, "As you will see,

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.000
the war has been kind to me enough.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.000
Despite the heavy gunfire,

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000
I've been able to get away from it all

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.000
and walk through the land of your ideas."

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.000
And Einstein was very impressed with his exact solution,

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.000
and I should hope also the dedication of the scientist.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.000
This is the hardworking scientist under harsh conditions.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000
And he took Schwarzschild's idea

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000
to the Prussian Academy of Sciences the next week.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.000
But Einstein always thought black holes were a mathematical oddity.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.000
He did not believe they existed in nature.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.000
He thought nature would protect us from their formation.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000
It was decades

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000
before the term "black hole" was coined

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.000
and people realized

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.000
that black holes are real astrophysical objects --

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000
in fact they're the death state

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000
of very massive stars

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000
that collapse catastrophically

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000
at the end of their lifetime.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000
Now our Sun will not collapse to a black hole.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000
It's actually not massive enough.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.000
But if we did a little thought experiment --

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000
as Einstein was very fond of doing --

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000
we could imagine

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.000
putting the Sun crushed down to six kilometers,

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.000
and putting a tiny little Earth around it in orbit,

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000
maybe 30 kilometers

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.000
outside of the black-hole sun.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.000
And it would be self-illuminated,

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000
because now the Sun's gone, we have no other source of light --

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.000
so let's make our little Earth self-illuminated.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.000
And you would realize you could put the Earth in a happy orbit

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000
even 30 km

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.000
outside of this crushed black hole.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000
This crushed black hole

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000
actually would fit inside Manhattan, more or less.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000
It might spill off into the Hudson a little bit

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000
before it destroyed the Earth.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000
But basically that's what we're talking about.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000
We're talking about an object that you could crush down

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000
to half the square area of Manhattan.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000
So we move this Earth very close --

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000
30 kilometers outside --

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.000
and we notice it's perfectly fine orbiting around the black hole.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.000
There's a sort of myth

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.000
that black holes devour everything in the universe,

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:46.000
but you actually have to get very close to fall in.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:49.000
But what's very impressive is that, from our vantage point,

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000
we can always see the Earth.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000
It cannot hide behind the black hole.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000
The light from the Earth, some of it falls in,

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.000
but some of it gets lensed around and brought back to us.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000
So you can't hide anything behind a black hole.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000
If this were Battlestar Galactica

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000
and you're fighting the Cylons,

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.000
don't hide behind the black hole.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.000
They can see you.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000
Now, our Sun will not collapse to a black hole --

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.000
it's not massive enough --

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:17.000
but there are tens of thousands of black holes in our galaxy.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.000
And if one were to eclipse the Milky Way,

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.000
this is what it would look like.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:25.000
We would see a shadow of that black hole

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.000
against the hundred billion stars

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.000
in the Milky Way Galaxy and its luminous dust lanes.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.000
And if we were to fall towards this black hole,

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:36.000
we would see all of that light lensed around it,

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.000
and we could even start to cross into that shadow

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.000
and really not notice that anything dramatic had happened.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:45.000
It would be bad if we tried to fire our rockets and get out of there

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.000
because we couldn't,

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.000
anymore than light can escape.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:52.000
But even though the black hole is dark from the outside,

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000
it's not dark on the inside,

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.000
because all of the light from the galaxy can fall in behind us.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:01.000
And even though, due to a relativistic effect known as time dilation,

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:04.000
our clocks would seem to slow down

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:07.000
relative to galactic time,

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:10.000
it would look as though the evolution of the galaxy

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000
had been sped up and shot at us,

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.000
right before we were crushed to death by the black hole.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.000
It would be like a near-death experience

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.000
where you see the light at the end of the tunnel,

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.000
but it's a total death experience.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.000
(Laughter)

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.000
And there's no way of telling anybody

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.000
about the light at the end of the tunnel.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:30.000
Now we've never seen a shadow like this of a black hole,

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000
but black holes can be heard,

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.000
even if they're not seen.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:38.000
Imagine now taking an astrophysically realistic situation --

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:41.000
imagine two black holes that have lived a long life together.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.000
Maybe they started as stars

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.000
and collapsed to two black holes --

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:48.000
each one 10 times the mass of the Sun.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.000
So now we're going to crush them down to 60 kilometers across.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.000
They can be spinning

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.000
hundreds of times a second.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.000
At the end of their lives,

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:00.000
they're going around each other very near the speed of light.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000
So they're crossing thousands of kilometers

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000
in a fraction of a second,

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.000
and as they do so, they not only curve space,

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.000
but they leave behind in their wake

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.000
a ringing of space,

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.000
an actual wave on space-time.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.000
Space squeezes and stretches

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.000
as it emanates out from these black holes

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.000
banging on the universe.

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.000
And they travel out into the cosmos

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.000
at the speed of light.

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.000
This computer simulation

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:27.000
is due to a relativity group at NASA Goddard.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:30.000
It took almost 30 years for anyone in the world to crack this problem.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.000
This was one of the groups.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.000
It shows two black holes in orbit around each other,

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.000
again, with these helpfully painted curves.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.000
And if you can see -- it's kind of faint --

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:42.000
but if you can see the red waves emanating out,

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:44.000
those are the gravitational waves.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:47.000
They're literally the sounds of space ringing,

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.000
and they will travel out from these black holes at the speed of light

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:52.000
as they ring down and coalesce

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.000
to one spinning, quiet black hole

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.000
at the end of the day.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.000
If you were standing near enough,

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.000
your ear would resonate

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.000
with the squeezing and stretching of space.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.000
You would literally hear the sound.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:08.000
Now of course, your head would be squeezed and stretched unhelpfully,

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:11.000
so you might have trouble understanding what's going on.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.000
But I'd like to play for you

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.000
the sound that we predict.

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:17.000
This is from my group --

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:20.000
a slightly less glamorous computer modeling.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.000
Imagine a lighter black hole

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.000
falling into a very heavy black hole.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.000
The sound you're hearing

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:29.000
is the light black hole banging on space

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.000
each time it gets close.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:34.000
If it gets far away, it's a little too quiet.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.000
But it comes in like a mallet,

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.000
and it literally cracks space,

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.000
wobbling it like a drum.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:43.000
And we can predict what the sound will be.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.000
We know that, as it falls in,

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.000
it gets faster and it gets louder.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.000
And eventually,

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:52.000
we're going to hear the little guy just fall into the bigger guy.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:11:09.000
(Thumping)

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.000
Then it's gone.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.000
Now I've never heard it that loud -- it's actually more dramatic.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.000
At home it sounds kind of anticlimactic.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.000
It's sort of like ding, ding, ding.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:21.000
This is another sound from my group.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.000
No, I'm not showing you any images,

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.000
because black holes don't leave behind

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.000
helpful trails of ink,

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.000
and space is not painted,

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.000
showing you the curves.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:33.000
But if you were to float by in space on a space holiday

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.000
and you heard this,

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:37.000
you want to get moving.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.000
(Laughter)

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.000
Want to get away from the sound.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:43.000
Both black holes are moving.

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:46.000
Both black holes are getting closer together.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:49.000
In this case, they're both wobbling quite a lot.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.000
And then they're going to merge.

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:59.000
(Thumping)

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.000
Now it's gone.

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:04.000
Now that chirp is very characteristic of black holes merging --

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:07.000
that it chirps up at the end.

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:09.000
Now that's our prediction

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:11.000
for what we'll see.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.000
Luckily we're at this safe distance in Long Beach, California.

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:15.000
And surely, somewhere in the universe

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:17.000
two black holes have merged.

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:19.000
And surely, the space around us

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:21.000
is ringing

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:24.000
after traveling maybe a million light years, or a million years,

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:27.000
at the speed of light to get to us.

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:30.000
But the sound is too quiet for any of us to ever hear.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:33.000
There are very industrious experiments being built on Earth --

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:35.000
one called LIGO --

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:37.000
which will detect deviations

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:40.000
in the squeezing and stretching of space

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:43.000
at less than the fraction of a nucleus of an atom

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:45.000
over four kilometers.

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:47.000
It's a remarkably ambitious experiment,

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:49.000
and it's going to be at advanced sensitivity

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:52.000
within the next few years -- to pick this up.

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.000
There's also a mission proposed for space,

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.000
which hopefully will launch in the next ten years,

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.000
called LISA.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:01.000
And LISA will be able to see super-massive black holes --

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:04.000
black holes millions or billions of times

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:06.000
the mass of the Sun.

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:09.000
In this Hubble image, we see two galaxies.

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:12.000
They look like they're frozen in some embrace.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.000
And each one probably harbors

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:17.000
a super-massive black hole at its core.

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:19.000
But they're not frozen;

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:21.000
they're actually merging.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.000
These two black holes are colliding,

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:26.000
and they will merge over a billion-year time scale.

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:28.000
It's beyond our human perception

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:31.000
to pick up a song of that duration.

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.000
But LISA could see the final stages

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:35.000
of two super-massive black holes

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:37.000
earlier in the universe's history,

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:40.000
the last 15 minutes before they fall together.

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:42.000
And it's not just black holes,

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:45.000
but it's also any big disturbance in the universe --

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.000
and the biggest of them all is the Big Bang.

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:50.000
When that expression was coined, it was derisive --

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.000
like, "Oh, who would believe in a Big Bang?"

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:54.000
But now it actually might be more technically accurate

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.000
because it might bang.

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:58.000
It might make a sound.

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:01.000
This animation from my friends at Proton Studios

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:03.000
shows looking at the Big Bang from the outside.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:06.000
We don't ever want to do that actually. We want to be inside the universe

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:09.000
because there's no such thing as standing outside the universe.

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:11.000
So imagine you're inside the Big Bang.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:13.000
It's everywhere, it's all around you,

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:15.000
and the space is wobbling chaotically.

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:17.000
Fourteen billion years pass

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:20.000
and this song is still ringing all around us.

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:22.000
Galaxies form,

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:24.000
and generations of stars form in those galaxies,

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.000
and around one star,

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.000
at least one star,

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.000
is a habitable planet.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:33.000
And here we are frantically building these experiments,

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:35.000
doing these calculations, writing these computer codes.

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:38.000
Imagine a billion years ago,

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:40.000
two black holes collided.

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.000
That song has been ringing through space

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:44.000
for all that time.

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.000
We weren't even here.

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.000
It gets closer and closer --

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:50.000
40,000 years ago, we're still doing cave paintings.

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:52.000
It's like hurry, build your instruments.

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:55.000
It's getting closer and closer, and in 20 ...

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:57.000
whatever year it will be

00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:59.000
when our detectors are finally at advanced sensitivity --

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:01.000
we'll build them, we'll turn on the machines

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:04.000
and, bang, we'll catch it -- the first song from space.

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:06.000
If it was the Big Bang we were going to pick up,

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:08.000
it would sound like this.

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:11.000
(Static) It's a terrible sound.

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:13.000
It's literally the definition of noise.

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:15.000
It's white noise; it's such a chaotic ringing.

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:18.000
But it's around us everywhere, presumably,

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.000
if it hasn't been wiped out

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:22.000
by some other process in the universe.

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:25.000
And if we pick it up, it will be music to our ears

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:27.000
because it will be the quiet echo

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:29.000
of that moment of our creation,

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:31.000
of our observable universe.

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:33.000
So within the next few years,

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:36.000
we'll be able to turn up the soundtrack a little bit,

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:39.000
render the universe in audio.

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:42.000
But if we detect those earliest moments,

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:44.000
it'll bring us that much closer

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:46.000
to an understanding of the Big Bang,

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:49.000
which brings us that much closer

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:52.000
to asking some of the hardest, most elusive, questions.

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:55.000
If we run the movie of our universe backwards,

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:58.000
we know that there was a Big Bang in our past,

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:02.000
and we might even hear the cacophonous sound of it,

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:04.000
but was our Big Bang the only Big Bang?

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:07.000
I mean we have to ask, has it happened before?

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:09.000
Will it happen again?

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:12.000
I mean, in the spirit of rising to TED's challenge

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:14.000
to reignite wonder,

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:17.000
we can ask questions, at least for this last minute,

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:19.000
that honestly might evade us forever.

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:21.000
But we have to ask:

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:23.000
Is it possible that our universe

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:26.000
is just a plume off of some greater history?

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:30.000
Or, is it possible that we're just a branch off of a multiverse --

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:34.000
each branch with its own Big Bang in its past --

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:36.000
maybe some of them with black holes playing drums,

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:38.000
maybe some without --

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:41.000
maybe some with sentient life, and maybe some without --

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:43.000
not in our past, not in our future,

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:46.000
but somehow fundamentally connected to us?

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:48.000
So we have to wonder, if there is a multiverse,

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:50.000
in some other patch of that multiverse,

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:52.000
are there creatures?

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:54.000
Here's my multiverse creatures.

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:56.000
Are there other creatures in the multiverse,

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:58.000
wondering about us

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:01.000
and wondering about their own origins?

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:03.000
And if they are,

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:06.000
I can imagine them as we are,

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:08.000
calculating, writing computer code,

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:10.000
building instruments,

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:13.000
trying to detect that faintest sound

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:15.000
of their origins

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:17.000
and wondering who else is out there.

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:20.000
Thank you. Thank you.

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:22.000
