00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Back in New York, I am the head of development

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
for a non-profit called Robin Hood.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
When I'm not fighting poverty, I'm fighting fires

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
as the assistant captain of a volunteer fire company.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Now in our town,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
where the volunteers supplement a highly skilled career staff,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
you have to get to the fire scene pretty early

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
to get in on any action.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
I remember my first fire.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
I was the second volunteer on the scene,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
so there was a pretty good chance I was going to get in.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
But still it was a real footrace against the other volunteers

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
to get to the captain in charge

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
to find out what our assignments would be.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
When I found the captain,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
he was having a very engaging conversation

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
with the homeowner,

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
who was surely having one of the worst days of her life.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
Here it was, the middle of the night,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
she was standing outside in the pouring rain,

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
under an umbrella, in her pajamas, barefoot,

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
while her house was in flames.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
The other volunteer who had arrived just before me --

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
let's call him Lex Luther --

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
(Laughter)

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
got to the captain first

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
and was asked to go inside

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
and save the homeowner's dog.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
The dog! I was stunned with jealousy.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
Here was some lawyer or money manager

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
who, for the rest of his life, gets to tell people

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
that he went into a burning building

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
to save a living creature,

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
just because he beat me by five seconds.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
Well, I was next.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
The captain waved me over.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
He said, "Bezos, I need you to go into the house.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
I need you to go upstairs, past the fire,

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000
and I need you to get this woman a pair of shoes."

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
(Laughter)

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
I swear.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
So, not exactly what I was hoping for,

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
but off I went --

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
up the stairs, down the hall, past the 'real' firefighters,

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
who were pretty much done putting out the fire at this point,

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
into the master bedroom to get a pair of shoes.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
Now I know what you're thinking,

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
but I'm no hero.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:04.000
(Laughter)

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
I carried my payload back downstairs

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
where I met my nemesis

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
and the precious dog by the front door.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000
We took our treasures outside to the homeowner,

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
where, not surprisingly,

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000
his received much more attention than did mine.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
A few weeks later,

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
the department received a letter from the homeowner

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
thanking us for the valiant effort displayed

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
in saving her home.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
The act of kindness she noted above all others:

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
someone had even gotten her a pair of shoes.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
(Laughter)

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
In both my vocation at Robin Hood

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
and my avocation as a volunteer firefighter,

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
I am witness to acts of generosity and kindness

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
on a monumental scale,

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
but I'm also witness to acts of grace and courage

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
on an individual basis.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
And you know what I've learned?

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000
They all matter.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
So as I look around this room

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
at people who either have achieved,

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
or are on their way to achieving,

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
remarkable levels of success,

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
I would offer this reminder:

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
don't wait.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
Don't wait until you make your first million

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
to make a difference in somebody's life.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
If you have something to give,

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000
give it now.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000
Serve food at a soup kitchen. Clean up a neighborhood park.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
Be a mentor.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
Not every day is going to offer us a chance

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
to save somebody's life,

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000
but every day offers us an opportunity to affect one.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000
So get in the game. Save the shoes.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000
Thank you.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:34.000
(Applause)

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000
Bruno Giussani: Mark, Mark, come back.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:43.000
(Applause)

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000
Mark Bezos: Thank you.
