00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:04.656
There's a beautiful statement
on the screen that says,

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:10.056
"Light creates ambiance,
light makes the feel of a space,

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.136
and light is also
the expression of structure."

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:14.976
Well, that was not by me.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.336
That was, of course, by Le Corbusier,
the famous architect.

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:23.976
And here you can see what he meant
in one of his beautiful buildings --

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.176
the chapel Notre Dame Du Haut
De Ronchamp --

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:33.736
where he creates this light that he could
only make because there's also dark.

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:38.960
And I think that is the quintessence
of this 18-minute talk --

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:44.976
that there is no good lighting
that is healthy and for our well-being

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.160
without proper darkness.

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:52.616
So this is how we normally
would light our offices.

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:57.536
We have codes and standards that tell us
that the lights should be so much Lux

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:59.816
and of great uniformity.

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:04.855
This is how we create uniform lighting
from one wall to the other

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:07.656
in a regular grid of lamps.

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.936
And that is quite different
from what I just showed you

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:12.640
from Le Corbusier.

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.736
If we would apply
these codes and standards

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:17.296
to the Pantheon in Rome,

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:19.176
it would never have looked like this,

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:24.896
because this beautiful light feature
that goes around there all by itself

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:28.816
can only appear because there is
also darkness in that same building.

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:33.536
And the same is more or less
what Santiago Calatrava said

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:38.336
when he said, "Light: I make it
in my buildings for comfort."

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:41.536
And he didn't mean the comfort
of a five-course dinner

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:43.496
as opposed to a one-course meal,

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:45.216
but he really meant the comfort

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.976
of the quality of the building
for the people.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.004
He meant that you can see the sky
and that you can experience the sun.

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:57.976
And he created these gorgeous buildings
where you can see the sky,

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.096
and where you can experience the sun,

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:03.000
that give us a better life
in the built environment,

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:10.056
just because of the relevance of light
in its brightness and also in its shadows.

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:14.016
And what it all boils down to is,
of course, the sun.

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:16.976
And this image of the Sun may suggest

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.176
that the Sun is something
evil and aggressive,

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:20.376
but we should not forget

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:23.976
that all energy on this planet
actually comes from the Sun,

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.800
and light is only
a manifestation of that energy.

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:33.136
The sun is for dynamics,
for color changes.

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:35.736
The sun is for beauty in our environment,

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:38.976
like in this building --
the High Museum in Atlanta,

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.936
which has been created
by Renzo Piano from Italy,

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:46.536
together with Arup Lighting,
a brilliant team of lighting designers,

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:53.016
who created a very subtle
modulation of light across the space,

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:55.358
responding to what the sun does outside,

00:02:55.382 --> 00:02:58.376
just because of all these
beautiful openings in the roof.

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:02.576
So in an indirect way,
you can see the sun.

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:06.056
And what they did is they created
an integral building element

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:11.856
to improve the quality of the space
that surrounds the visitors of the museum.

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:15.136
They created this shade
that you can see here,

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:18.816
which actually covers the sun,

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:21.355
but opens up to the good
light from the sky.

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:25.816
And here you can see how they really
crafted a beautiful design process

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:27.056
with physical models,

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:30.336
with quantitative
as well as qualitative methods,

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:34.576
to come to a final solution
that is truly integrated

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:37.136
and completely holistic
with the architecture.

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:39.656
They allowed themselves
a few mistakes along the way.

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:42.536
As you can see here,
there's some direct light on the floor,

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:45.176
but they could easily figure out
where that comes from.

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:50.776
And they allow people in that building
to really enjoy the sun,

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:52.896
the good part of the sun.

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:57.336
And enjoying the sun
can be in many different ways, of course.

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:59.176
It can be just like this,

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:02.620
or maybe like this,
which is rather peculiar,

00:04:02.644 --> 00:04:04.736
but this is in 1963 --

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:08.776
the viewing of a sun eclipse
in the United States.

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:11.056
And it's just a bit bright up there,

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:14.240
so these people have found
a very intriguing solution.

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:18.096
This is, I think, a very illustrative
image of what I try to say --

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:23.016
that the beautiful dynamics of sun,
bringing these into the building,

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:27.576
creates a quality of our built environment
that truly enhances our lives.

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:29.896
And this is all about darkness

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:32.016
as much as it is
about lightness, of course,

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:34.656
because otherwise
you don't see these dynamics.

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:36.136
As opposed to the first office

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:39.216
that I showed you
in the beginning of the talk,

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:42.296
this is a well-known office,
which is the Weidt Group.

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:45.376
They are in green energy consulting,
or something like that.

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:47.353
And they really practice what they preach

00:04:47.377 --> 00:04:50.296
because this office doesn't have
any electric lighting at all.

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:54.576
It has only, on one side,
this big, big glass window

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:58.176
that helps to let the sunlight
enter deep into the space

00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:01.616
and create a beautiful quality there
and a great dynamic range.

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:04.256
So it can be very dim over there,
and you do your work,

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:07.056
and it can be very bright over there,
and you do your work.

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:10.976
But actually, the human eye
turns out to be remarkably adaptable

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.896
to all these different light conditions
that together create an environment

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:17.336
that is never boring
and that is never dull,

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:20.000
and therefore helps us
to enhance our lives.

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:24.696
I really owe a short introduction
of this man to you.

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:28.656
This is Richard Kelly
who was born 100 years ago,

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:32.496
which is the reason I bring him up now,
because it's kind of an anniversary year.

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:37.616
In the 1930s, Richard Kelly
was the first person to really describe

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:39.576
a methodology of modern lighting design.

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:41.416
And he coined three terms,

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:45.336
which are "focal glow,"
"ambient luminescence"

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:47.016
and "play of the brilliants" --

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:51.536
three very distinctly different
ideas about light in architecture

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:55.536
that all together
make up this beautiful experience.

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:56.976
So to begin with, focal glow.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:58.576
He meant something like this --

00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:00.976
where the light
gives direction to the space

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:02.976
and helps you to get around.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:04.216
Or something like this,

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:06.856
which is the lighting design
he did for General Motors,

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:08.096
for the car showroom.

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:09.336
And you enter that space,

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:12.656
and you feel like,
"Wow! This is so impressive,"

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:16.736
just because of this focal point,
this huge light source in the middle.

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:18.475
To me, it is something from theater,

00:06:18.499 --> 00:06:20.696
and I will get back to that
a little bit later.

00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:24.376
It's the spotlight on the artist
that helps you to focus.

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:27.216
It could also be the sunlight
that breaks through the clouds

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:30.656
and lights up a patch of the land,

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:34.240
highlighting it
compared to the dim environment.

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:38.896
Or it can be in today's retail,
in the shopping environment --

00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:42.936
lighting the merchandise and creating
accents that help you to get around.

00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:45.976
Ambient luminescence
is something very different.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:49.096
Richard Kelly saw it
as something infinite,

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:51.416
something without any focus,

00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:56.256
something where all details
actually dissolve in infinity.

00:06:56.280 --> 00:07:02.176
And I see it as a very comfortable kind
of light that really helps us to relax

00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:03.616
and to contemplate.

00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:05.456
It could also be something like this:

00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:07.576
the National Museum of Science in London,

00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:12.696
where this blue is embracing
all the exhibitions and galleries

00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:15.216
in one large gesture.

00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:16.456
And then finally,

00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:18.936
Kelly's play of brilliants added to that

00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:22.296
really some play, I think,
of the skyline of Hong Kong,

00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:24.656
or perhaps the chandelier
in the opera house,

00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:26.296
or in the theater here,

00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:30.496
which is the decoration,
the icing on the cake, something playful,

00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:34.056
something that is just an addition
to the architectural environment,

00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:35.296
I would say.

00:07:35.320 --> 00:07:37.896
These three distinct elements, together,

00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:41.080
make a lighting environment
that helps us to feel better.

00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:43.816
And we can only
create these out of darkness.

00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:45.416
And I will explain that further.

00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:48.616
And I guess that is something
that Richard Kelly, here on the left,

00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:50.976
was explaining
to Ludwig Mies van Der Rohe.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.736
And behind them,
you see that Seagram Building

00:07:53.760 --> 00:07:58.200
that later turned into an icon
of modern lighting design.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.785
Those times, there were
some early attempts

00:08:01.809 --> 00:08:03.296
also for light therapy already.

00:08:03.320 --> 00:08:04.496
You can see here a photo

00:08:04.520 --> 00:08:06.656
from the United States
Library of Medicine,

00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:09.776
where people are put
in the sun to get better.

00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:12.991
It's a little bit of a different story,
this health aspect of light,

00:08:13.015 --> 00:08:14.575
than what I'm telling you today.

00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:17.736
In today's modern medicine,

00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:23.256
there is a real understanding of light
in an almost biochemical way.

00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:27.976
And there is the idea
that, when we look at things,

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.176
it is the yellow light
that helps us the most,

00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:32.176
that we are the most sensitive for.

00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:34.816
But our circadian rhythms,

00:08:34.840 --> 00:08:37.296
which are the rhythms
that help us to wake and sleep

00:08:37.320 --> 00:08:39.696
and be alert and relaxed
and so forth and so on,

00:08:39.720 --> 00:08:42.456
they are much more triggered
by blue light.

00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:46.376
And by modulating the amount
of blue in our environment,

00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:49.776
we can help people
to relax, or to be alert,

00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:52.096
to fall asleep, or to stay awake.

00:08:52.120 --> 00:08:58.136
And that is how, maybe in the near future,
light can help hospitals

00:08:58.160 --> 00:09:03.576
to make people better sooner,
recover them quicker.

00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:06.976
Maybe in the airplane,
we can overcome jet lag like that.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:10.782
Perhaps in school,
we can help children to learn better

00:09:10.806 --> 00:09:12.854
because they concentrate more
on their work.

00:09:12.878 --> 00:09:15.376
And you can imagine
a lot more applications.

00:09:15.400 --> 00:09:16.976
But I would like to talk further

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:22.776
about the combination
of light and darkness

00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:24.720
as a quality in our life.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:29.896
So light is, of course,
for social interaction also --

00:09:29.920 --> 00:09:33.576
to create relationships
with all the features around us.

00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:35.976
It is the place where we gather around

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.256
when we have to say something
to each other.

00:09:38.280 --> 00:09:40.456
And it is all about this planet.

00:09:40.480 --> 00:09:42.736
But when you look at this planet at night,

00:09:42.760 --> 00:09:44.096
it looks like this.

00:09:44.120 --> 00:09:47.656
And I think this is the most shocking
image in my talk today.

00:09:47.680 --> 00:09:51.296
Because all this light here
goes up to the sky.

00:09:51.320 --> 00:09:55.216
It never reaches the ground
where it was meant for.

00:09:55.240 --> 00:09:57.376
It never is to the benefit of people.

00:09:57.400 --> 00:09:59.216
It only spoils the darkness.

00:09:59.240 --> 00:10:02.456
So at a global scale, it looks like this.

00:10:02.480 --> 00:10:05.216
And, I mean, that is quite amazing,
what you see here --

00:10:05.240 --> 00:10:10.576
how much light goes up into the sky
and never reaches the ground.

00:10:10.600 --> 00:10:13.336
Because if we look at the Earth
the way it should be,

00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:16.376
it would be something
like this very inspiring image

00:10:16.400 --> 00:10:20.696
where darkness is for our imagination
and for contemplation

00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:23.400
and to help us to relate to everything.

00:10:24.280 --> 00:10:25.696
The world is changing though,

00:10:25.720 --> 00:10:27.936
and urbanization
is a big driver of everything.

00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:30.378
I took this photo
two weeks ago in Guangzhou,

00:10:30.402 --> 00:10:32.057
and I realized that 10 years ago,

00:10:32.081 --> 00:10:35.841
there was nothing like this,
of these buildings.

00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:38.816
It was just a much smaller city,

00:10:38.840 --> 00:10:42.296
and the pace of urbanization
is incredible and enormous.

00:10:42.320 --> 00:10:45.336
And we have to understand
these main questions:

00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:48.976
How do people move
through these new urban spaces?

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:50.576
How do they share their culture?

00:10:50.600 --> 00:10:52.440
How do we tackle things like mobility?

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:54.896
And how can light help there?

00:10:54.920 --> 00:10:56.376
Because the new technologies,

00:10:56.400 --> 00:10:58.856
they seem to be
in a really interesting position

00:10:58.880 --> 00:11:02.736
to contribute to the solutions
of urbanization

00:11:02.760 --> 00:11:06.096
and to provide us
with better environments.

00:11:06.120 --> 00:11:07.496
It's not that long ago

00:11:07.520 --> 00:11:11.256
that our lighting was just done
with these kinds of lamps.

00:11:11.280 --> 00:11:13.376
And of course,
we had the metal-halide lamps

00:11:13.400 --> 00:11:15.496
and fluorescent lamps
and things like that.

00:11:15.520 --> 00:11:17.016
Now we have LED,

00:11:17.040 --> 00:11:21.096
but here you see the latest one,
and you see how incredibly small it is.

00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:24.736
And this is exactly
what offers us a unique opportunity,

00:11:24.760 --> 00:11:27.976
because this tiny, tiny size allows us

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.336
to put the light
wherever we really need it.

00:11:30.360 --> 00:11:33.256
And we can actually leave it out
where it's not needed at all

00:11:33.280 --> 00:11:34.976
and where we can preserve darkness.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:37.496
So that is a really interesting
proposition, I think,

00:11:37.520 --> 00:11:41.096
and a new way of lighting
the architectural environment

00:11:41.120 --> 00:11:43.000
with our well-being in mind.

00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:47.376
The problem is, though, that I wanted
to explain to you how this really works --

00:11:47.400 --> 00:11:49.816
but I can have four of these on my finger,

00:11:49.840 --> 00:11:51.936
so you would not be able
to really see them.

00:11:51.960 --> 00:11:55.016
So I asked our laboratory
to do something about it,

00:11:55.040 --> 00:11:57.056
and they said,
"Well, we can do something."

00:11:57.080 --> 00:11:59.616
They created for me
the biggest LED in the world

00:11:59.640 --> 00:12:01.656
especially for TEDx in Amsterdam.

00:12:01.680 --> 00:12:03.016
So here it is.

00:12:03.040 --> 00:12:05.456
It's the same thing
as you can see over there --

00:12:05.480 --> 00:12:07.096
just 200 times bigger.

00:12:07.120 --> 00:12:09.456
And I will very quickly
show you how it works.

00:12:09.480 --> 00:12:12.336
So just to explain.

00:12:12.360 --> 00:12:18.560
Now, every LED that is made
these days gives blue light.

00:12:19.560 --> 00:12:22.776
Now, this is not very pleasant
and comfortable.

00:12:22.800 --> 00:12:29.696
And for that reason,
we cover the LED with a phosphor cap.

00:12:29.720 --> 00:12:32.416
And the phosphor is excited by the blue

00:12:32.440 --> 00:12:35.536
and makes the light white
and warm and pleasant.

00:12:35.560 --> 00:12:37.896
And then when you add the lens to that,

00:12:37.920 --> 00:12:41.616
you can bundle the light
and send it wherever you need it

00:12:41.640 --> 00:12:44.976
without any need to spill any light
to the sky or anywhere else.

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:48.296
So you can preserve the darkness
and make the light.

00:12:48.320 --> 00:12:53.416
I just wanted to show that to you
so you understand how this works.

00:12:53.440 --> 00:12:54.456
(Applause)

00:12:54.480 --> 00:12:55.668
Thank you.

00:12:55.692 --> 00:12:56.756
(Applause)

00:12:56.780 --> 00:12:57.976
We can go further.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:01.216
So we have to rethink
the way we light our cities.

00:13:01.240 --> 00:13:05.976
We have to think again
about light as a default solution.

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.416
Why are all these motorways
permanently lit?

00:13:08.440 --> 00:13:09.656
Is it really needed?

00:13:09.680 --> 00:13:11.376
Can we maybe be much more selective

00:13:11.400 --> 00:13:14.736
and create better environments
that also benefit from darkness?

00:13:14.760 --> 00:13:16.976
Can we be much more gentle with light?

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:19.816
Like here -- this is
a very low light level actually.

00:13:19.840 --> 00:13:23.456
Can we engage people more
in the lighting projects that we create,

00:13:23.480 --> 00:13:26.056
so they really want
to connect with it, like here?

00:13:26.080 --> 00:13:27.940
Or can we create simply sculptures

00:13:27.964 --> 00:13:30.576
that are very inspiring
to be in and to be around?

00:13:30.600 --> 00:13:32.576
And can we preserve the darkness?

00:13:32.600 --> 00:13:34.839
Because to find a place
like this today on Earth

00:13:34.863 --> 00:13:37.503
is really very, very challenging.

00:13:38.440 --> 00:13:41.736
And to find a starry sky like this
is even more difficult.

00:13:41.760 --> 00:13:44.736
Even in the oceans,
we are creating a lot of light

00:13:44.760 --> 00:13:46.216
that we could actually ban

00:13:46.240 --> 00:13:49.896
also for animal life
to have a much greater well-being.

00:13:49.920 --> 00:13:53.216
And it's known that migrating birds,
for example, get very disoriented

00:13:53.240 --> 00:13:55.296
because of these offshore platforms.

00:13:55.320 --> 00:13:58.096
And we discovered that
when we make those lights green,

00:13:58.120 --> 00:14:00.136
the birds, they actually go the right way.

00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:02.176
They are not disturbed anymore.

00:14:02.200 --> 00:14:04.018
And it turns out once again

00:14:04.042 --> 00:14:08.200
that spectral sensitivity
is very important here.

00:14:08.920 --> 00:14:11.376
In all of these examples, I think,

00:14:11.400 --> 00:14:14.296
we should start making
the light out of darkness,

00:14:14.320 --> 00:14:18.216
and use the darkness as a canvas --
like the visual artists do,

00:14:18.240 --> 00:14:20.496
like Edward Hopper in this painting.

00:14:20.520 --> 00:14:23.216
I think that there is
a lot of suspense in this painting.

00:14:23.240 --> 00:14:27.456
I think, when I see it,
I start to think, who are those people?

00:14:27.480 --> 00:14:29.736
Where have they come from?
Where are they going?

00:14:29.760 --> 00:14:30.976
What just happened?

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:33.256
What will be happening
in the next five minutes?

00:14:33.280 --> 00:14:36.136
And it only embodies
all these stories and all this suspense

00:14:36.160 --> 00:14:38.016
because of the darkness and the light.

00:14:38.040 --> 00:14:39.816
Edward Hopper was a real master

00:14:39.840 --> 00:14:43.456
in creating the narration
by working with light and dark.

00:14:43.480 --> 00:14:44.776
And we can learn from that

00:14:44.800 --> 00:14:48.576
and create more interesting
and inspiring architectural environments.

00:14:48.600 --> 00:14:51.056
We can do that in commercial
spaces like this.

00:14:51.080 --> 00:14:53.936
And you can still also go outside

00:14:53.960 --> 00:14:58.776
and enjoy the greatest show
in the universe,

00:14:58.800 --> 00:15:01.240
which is, of course, the universe itself.

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:08.416
So I give you this wonderful,
informative image of the sky,

00:15:08.440 --> 00:15:10.096
ranging from the inner city,

00:15:10.120 --> 00:15:13.816
where you may see one or two stars
and nothing else,

00:15:13.840 --> 00:15:16.176
all the way to the rural environments,

00:15:16.200 --> 00:15:20.456
where you can enjoy this great
and gorgeous and beautiful performance

00:15:20.480 --> 00:15:22.856
of the constellations and the stars.

00:15:22.880 --> 00:15:24.960
In architecture, it works just the same.

00:15:25.640 --> 00:15:29.016
By appreciating the darkness
when you design the light,

00:15:29.040 --> 00:15:31.616
you create much more
interesting environments

00:15:31.640 --> 00:15:33.960
that truly enhance our lives.

00:15:34.560 --> 00:15:38.576
This is the most well-known example,
Tadao Ando's Church of the Light.

00:15:38.600 --> 00:15:44.216
But I also think
of Peter Zumthor's spa in Vals,

00:15:44.240 --> 00:15:47.056
where light and dark,
in very gentle combinations,

00:15:47.080 --> 00:15:49.616
alter each other to define the space.

00:15:49.640 --> 00:15:52.936
Or Richard MacCormac's
Southwark tube station in London,

00:15:52.960 --> 00:15:56.531
where you can really see the sky,
even though you are under the ground.

00:15:57.160 --> 00:15:58.856
And finally, I want to point out

00:15:58.880 --> 00:16:01.376
that a lot of this inspiration
comes from theater.

00:16:01.400 --> 00:16:05.536
And I think it's fantastic
that we are today experiencing TEDx

00:16:05.560 --> 00:16:08.056
in a theater for the first time

00:16:08.080 --> 00:16:12.456
because I think we really owe
to the theater a big thanks.

00:16:12.480 --> 00:16:14.736
It wouldn't be
such an inspiring scenography

00:16:14.760 --> 00:16:15.960
without this theater.

00:16:16.560 --> 00:16:22.776
And I think the theater is a place
where we truly enhance life with light.

00:16:22.800 --> 00:16:24.016
Thank you very much.

00:16:24.040 --> 00:16:30.000
(Applause)
