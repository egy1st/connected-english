00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
This is about a place in London

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
called Kiteflyer's Hill

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
where I used to go and spend hours

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
going "When is he coming back? When is he coming back?"

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
So this is another one dedicated to that guy ...

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
who I've got over.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
But this is "Kiteflyer's Hill."

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
It's a beautiful song written by a guy called Martin Evan,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:23.000
actually, for me.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Boo Hewerdine, Thomas Dolby,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
thank you very much for inviting me. It's been a blessing singing for you.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Thank you very much.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.000
♫ Do you remember when we used to go ♫

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.000
♫ up to Kiteflyer's Hill? ♫

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.000
♫ Those summer nights, so still ♫

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.000
♫ with all of the city beneath us ♫

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.000
♫ and all of our lives ahead ♫

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.000
♫ before cruel and foolish words ♫

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.000
♫ were cruelly and foolishly said ♫

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
♫ Some nights I think of you ♫

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
♫ and then I go up ♫

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000
♫ on Kiteflyer's Hill ♫

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.000
♫ wrapped up against the winter chill ♫

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:41.000
♫ And somewhere in the city beneath me ♫

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.000
♫ you lie asleep in your bed ♫

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.000
♫ and I wonder if ever just briefly ♫

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:55.000
♫ do I creep in your dreams now and then ♫

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:01.000
♫ Where are you now? ♫

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:10.000
♫ My wild summer love ♫

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:21.000
♫ Where are you now? ♫

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.000
♫ Have the years been kind? ♫

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.000
♫ And do you think of me sometimes ♫

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:35.000
♫ up on Kiteflyer's Hill? ♫

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:43.000
♫ Oh, I pray you one day will ♫

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:48.000
♫ We won't say a word ♫

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
♫ We won't need them ♫

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
♫ Sometimes silence is best ♫

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:59.000
♫ We'll just stand in the still of the evening ♫

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:04.000
♫ and whisper farewell to loneliness ♫

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:09.000
♫ Where are you now? ♫

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:19.000
♫ My wild summer love ♫

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:27.000
♫ Where are you now? ♫

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000
♫ Do you think of me sometimes? ♫

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000
♫ And do you ever make that climb? ♫

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:42.000
♫ Where are you now? ♫

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:50.000
♫ My wild summer love ♫

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:00.000
♫ Where are you now? ♫

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:05.000
♫ Have the years been kind? ♫

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:09.000
♫ And do you ever make that climb ♫

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:26.000
♫ up on Kiteflyer's Hill? Kiteflyer's ... ♫

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:43.000
♫ [French] ♫

00:04:43.000 --> 00:05:10.000
♫ Where are you? Where are you now? ♫

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.000
♫ Where are you now? ♫

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:55.000
♫ Kiteflyer's ... ♫

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.000
(Applause)

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.000
Gracias. Thank you very much.
