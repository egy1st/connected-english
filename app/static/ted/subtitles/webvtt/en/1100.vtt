WEBVTT

00:00:00.786 --> 00:00:03.444
If I should have a daughter,

00:00:03.468 --> 00:00:05.579
instead of "Mom,"

00:00:05.603 --> 00:00:08.904
she's going to call me "Point B,"

00:00:08.928 --> 00:00:11.555
because that way she knows
that no matter what happens,

00:00:11.579 --> 00:00:13.976
at least she can always find
her way to me.

00:00:14.523 --> 00:00:17.920
And I'm going to paint solar systems
on the backs of her hands

00:00:17.944 --> 00:00:19.882
so she has to learn the entire universe

00:00:19.906 --> 00:00:23.000
before she can say, "Oh, I know that
like the back of my hand."

00:00:23.357 --> 00:00:24.976
And she's going to learn

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.976
that this life will hit you
hard in the face,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.295
wait for you to get back up just
so it can kick you in the stomach.

00:00:31.319 --> 00:00:33.231
But getting the wind knocked out of you

00:00:33.255 --> 00:00:35.101
is the only way to remind your lungs

00:00:35.125 --> 00:00:36.976
how much they like the taste of air.

00:00:37.751 --> 00:00:39.276
There is hurt, here,

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.640
that cannot be fixed
by Band-Aids or poetry.

00:00:41.664 --> 00:00:44.976
So the first time she realizes
that Wonder Woman isn't coming,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.514
I'll make sure she knows

00:00:46.538 --> 00:00:48.937
she doesn't have to wear
the cape all by herself,

00:00:48.961 --> 00:00:51.451
because no matter how wide
you stretch your fingers,

00:00:51.475 --> 00:00:53.150
your hands will always be too small

00:00:53.174 --> 00:00:55.691
to catch all the pain you want to heal.

00:00:55.715 --> 00:00:57.694
Believe me, I've tried.

00:00:57.718 --> 00:00:59.013
"And, baby," I'll tell her,

00:00:59.037 --> 00:01:01.155
don't keep your nose up
in the air like that.

00:01:01.179 --> 00:01:03.453
I know that trick;
I've done it a million times.

00:01:03.477 --> 00:01:04.976
You're just smelling for smoke

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.976
so you can follow the trail
back to a burning house,

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.619
so you can find the boy
who lost everything in the fire

00:01:10.643 --> 00:01:11.975
to see if you can save him.

00:01:12.573 --> 00:01:15.976
Or else find the boy who lit
the fire in the first place,

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.477
to see if you can change him.

00:01:18.501 --> 00:01:19.976
But I know she will anyway,

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.048
so instead I'll always keep
an extra supply

00:01:22.072 --> 00:01:24.190
of chocolate and rain boots nearby,

00:01:24.214 --> 00:01:27.103
because there is no heartbreak
that chocolate can't fix.

00:01:28.158 --> 00:01:30.301
Okay, there's a few
that chocolate can't fix.

00:01:30.325 --> 00:01:32.563
But that's what the rain boots are for,

00:01:32.587 --> 00:01:35.976
because rain will wash away
everything, if you let it.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.976
I want her to look at the world

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.582
through the underside
of a glass-bottom boat,

00:01:40.606 --> 00:01:41.976
to look through a microscope

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.976
at the galaxies that exist

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.175
on the pinpoint of a human mind,

00:01:46.199 --> 00:01:48.207
because that's the way my mom taught me.

00:01:48.231 --> 00:01:49.976
That there'll be days like this.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.976
(Singing) There'll be days
like this, my momma said.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:54.976
When you open your hands to catch

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.547
and wind up with only
blisters and bruises;

00:01:57.571 --> 00:01:59.976
when you step out of the phone
booth and try to fly

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.877
and the very people you want to save

00:02:01.901 --> 00:02:03.640
are the ones standing on your cape;

00:02:03.664 --> 00:02:05.568
when your boots will fill with rain,

00:02:05.592 --> 00:02:07.976
and you'll be up to your knees
in disappointment.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.502
And those are the very days you have
all the more reason to say thank you.

00:02:11.526 --> 00:02:13.381
Because there's nothing more beautiful

00:02:13.405 --> 00:02:16.266
than the way the ocean refuses
to stop kissing the shoreline,

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:18.532
no matter how many times it's sent away.

00:02:18.556 --> 00:02:22.587
You will put the wind
in win some, lose some.

00:02:22.611 --> 00:02:25.976
You will put the star
in starting over, and over.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.976
And no matter how many land
mines erupt in a minute,

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.626
be sure your mind lands

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:33.007
on the beauty of this
funny place called life.

00:02:33.031 --> 00:02:35.793
And yes, on a scale
from one to over-trusting,

00:02:35.817 --> 00:02:37.976
I am pretty damn naive.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.499
But I want her to know
that this world is made out of sugar.

00:02:41.523 --> 00:02:42.976
It can crumble so easily,

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.976
but don't be afraid to stick
your tongue out and taste it.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.976
"Baby," I'll tell her, "remember,
your momma is a worrier,

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.834
and your poppa is a warrior,

00:02:50.858 --> 00:02:53.220
and you are the girl
with small hands and big eyes

00:02:53.244 --> 00:02:54.976
who never stops asking for more."

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.579
Remember that good things come in threes

00:02:57.603 --> 00:02:59.022
and so do bad things.

00:02:59.508 --> 00:03:02.388
Always apologize when
you've done something wrong,

00:03:02.412 --> 00:03:03.793
but don't you ever apologize

00:03:03.817 --> 00:03:05.976
for the way your eyes
refuse to stop shining.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.976
Your voice is small,
but don't ever stop singing.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.976
And when they finally hand you heartache,

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.976
when they slip war
and hatred under your door

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.976
and offer you handouts on street-corners

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.976
of cynicism and defeat,

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.128
you tell them that they really
ought to meet your mother.

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:24.571
(Applause)

00:03:24.595 --> 00:03:27.976
Thank you. Thank you.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.325
(Applause)

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:32.713
Thank you.

00:03:32.737 --> 00:03:34.896
(Applause)

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.009
Thanks.

00:03:37.033 --> 00:03:40.181
(Applause)

00:03:40.293 --> 00:03:41.476
Thank you.

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:44.976
(Applause)

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.976
All right, so I want you to take a moment,

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.976
and I want you to think of three things
that you know to be true.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:53.976
They can be about whatever you want --

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.558
technology, entertainment, design,

00:03:56.582 --> 00:03:58.511
your family, what you had for breakfast.

00:03:58.535 --> 00:04:00.503
The only rule is don't think too hard.

00:04:01.281 --> 00:04:03.000
Okay, ready? Go.

00:04:09.722 --> 00:04:10.730
Okay.

00:04:11.127 --> 00:04:13.334
So here are three things
I know to be true.

00:04:13.358 --> 00:04:16.389
I know that Jean-Luc Godard
was right when he said that,

00:04:16.413 --> 00:04:19.437
"A good story has a beginning,
a middle and an end,

00:04:19.461 --> 00:04:21.748
although not necessarily in that order."

00:04:21.772 --> 00:04:24.976
I know that I'm incredibly nervous
and excited to be up here,

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.001
which is greatly inhibiting
my ability to keep it cool.

00:04:28.025 --> 00:04:29.358
(Laughter)

00:04:29.382 --> 00:04:30.976
And I know

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.724
that I have been waiting
all week to tell this joke.

00:04:34.336 --> 00:04:35.892
(Laughter)

00:04:35.916 --> 00:04:38.090
Why was the scarecrow invited to TED?

00:04:38.868 --> 00:04:41.281
Because he was out standing in his field.

00:04:41.765 --> 00:04:43.773
(Laughter)

00:04:44.543 --> 00:04:46.112
I'm sorry.

00:04:47.265 --> 00:04:50.401
Okay, so these are three things
I know to be true.

00:04:50.425 --> 00:04:53.608
But there are plenty of things
I have trouble understanding.

00:04:53.632 --> 00:04:56.528
So I write poems to figure things out.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.810
Sometimes the only way I know
how to work through something

00:04:59.834 --> 00:05:01.287
is by writing a poem.

00:05:01.311 --> 00:05:03.209
Sometimes I get to the end of the poem,

00:05:03.233 --> 00:05:05.760
look back and go,
"Oh, that's what this is all about,"

00:05:05.784 --> 00:05:07.801
and sometimes I get to the end of the poem

00:05:07.825 --> 00:05:09.160
and haven't solved anything,

00:05:09.184 --> 00:05:11.358
but at least I have a new poem out of it.

00:05:11.382 --> 00:05:14.081
Spoken-word poetry is the art
of performance poetry.

00:05:14.105 --> 00:05:16.552
I tell people it involves creating poetry

00:05:16.576 --> 00:05:18.464
that doesn't just want to sit on paper,

00:05:18.488 --> 00:05:21.297
that something about it
demands it be heard out loud

00:05:21.321 --> 00:05:22.694
or witnessed in person.

00:05:23.249 --> 00:05:25.154
When I was a freshman in high school,

00:05:25.178 --> 00:05:28.976
I was a live wire of nervous hormones.

00:05:29.542 --> 00:05:32.976
And I was underdeveloped
and over-excitable.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:34.976
And despite my fear

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.166
of ever being looked at for too long,

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:40.411
I was fascinated by the idea
of spoken-word poetry.

00:05:40.435 --> 00:05:44.075
I felt that my two secret loves,
poetry and theater,

00:05:44.099 --> 00:05:47.028
had come together, had a baby,

00:05:47.052 --> 00:05:48.717
a baby I needed to get to know.

00:05:48.741 --> 00:05:50.686
So I decided to give it a try.

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:52.614
My first spoken-word poem,

00:05:52.638 --> 00:05:55.976
packed with all the wisdom
of a 14-year-old,

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:57.976
was about the injustice

00:05:58.000 --> 00:05:59.566
of being seen as unfeminine.

00:06:00.026 --> 00:06:02.860
The poem was very indignant,

00:06:02.884 --> 00:06:04.026
and mainly exaggerated,

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:07.278
but the only spoken-word poetry
that I had seen up until that point

00:06:07.302 --> 00:06:08.976
was mainly indignant,

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.334
so I thought
that's what was expected of me.

00:06:11.358 --> 00:06:12.976
The first time that I performed,

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.489
the audience of teenagers hooted
and hollered their sympathy,

00:06:16.513 --> 00:06:18.976
and when I came off the stage,
I was shaking.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:20.887
I felt this tap on my shoulder,

00:06:20.911 --> 00:06:22.467
and I turned around to see

00:06:22.491 --> 00:06:25.402
this giant girl in a hoodie
sweatshirt emerge from the crowd.

00:06:25.426 --> 00:06:26.841
She was maybe eight feet tall

00:06:26.865 --> 00:06:29.323
and looked like she could
beat me up with one hand,

00:06:29.347 --> 00:06:32.424
but instead she just nodded
at me and said,

00:06:32.530 --> 00:06:34.213
"Hey, I really felt that. Thanks."

00:06:35.514 --> 00:06:36.681
And lightning struck.

00:06:36.974 --> 00:06:38.245
I was hooked.

00:06:38.471 --> 00:06:41.739
I discovered this bar
on Manhattan's Lower East Side

00:06:41.763 --> 00:06:43.976
that hosted a weekly poetry open Mic,

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.976
and my bewildered,
but supportive, parents took me

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.976
to soak in every ounce
of spoken word that I could.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.976
I was the youngest by at least a decade,

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.976
but somehow the poets
at the Bowery Poetry Club

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.221
didn't seem bothered
by the 14-year-old wandering about.

00:06:59.245 --> 00:07:00.770
In fact, they welcomed me.

00:07:00.794 --> 00:07:03.731
And it was here, listening to these poets
share their stories,

00:07:03.755 --> 00:07:06.938
that I learned that spoken-word
poetry didn't have to be indignant,

00:07:06.962 --> 00:07:09.282
it could be fun or painful

00:07:09.306 --> 00:07:11.242
or serious or silly.

00:07:11.266 --> 00:07:14.520
The Bowery Poetry Club became
my classroom and my home,

00:07:14.544 --> 00:07:16.180
and the poets who performed

00:07:16.204 --> 00:07:18.584
encouraged me to share my stories as well.

00:07:18.608 --> 00:07:20.497
Never mind the fact that I was 14.

00:07:20.521 --> 00:07:22.976
They told me, "Write about being 14."

00:07:23.640 --> 00:07:25.719
So I did and stood amazed every week

00:07:25.743 --> 00:07:27.976
when these brilliant, grown-up poets

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.001
laughed with me and groaned their sympathy

00:07:30.025 --> 00:07:33.328
and clapped and told me,
"Hey, I really felt that too."

00:07:34.161 --> 00:07:37.403
Now I can divide my spoken-word journey

00:07:37.427 --> 00:07:38.976
into three steps.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:40.817
Step one was the moment I said,

00:07:40.841 --> 00:07:42.976
"I can. I can do this."

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.187
And that was thanks to a girl in a hoodie.

00:07:45.211 --> 00:07:47.266
Step two was the moment I said,

00:07:47.290 --> 00:07:49.374
"I will. I will continue.

00:07:49.482 --> 00:07:52.362
I love spoken word. I will keep
coming back week after week."

00:07:52.386 --> 00:07:53.976
And step three began

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.800
when I realized I didn't have
to write indignant poems,

00:07:56.824 --> 00:07:58.222
if that's not what I was.

00:07:58.246 --> 00:08:00.411
There were things
that were specific to me,

00:08:00.435 --> 00:08:02.976
and the more that I focused
on those things,

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:04.976
the weirder my poetry got,

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:06.976
but the more that it felt like mine.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:10.698
It's not just the adage
"Write what you know."

00:08:10.722 --> 00:08:13.547
It's about gathering up
all of the knowledge and experience

00:08:13.571 --> 00:08:15.182
you've collected up to now

00:08:15.206 --> 00:08:17.945
to help you dive into the things
you don't know.

00:08:17.969 --> 00:08:20.852
I use poetry to help me work
through what I don't understand,

00:08:20.876 --> 00:08:22.821
but I show up to each new poem

00:08:22.845 --> 00:08:25.976
with a backpack full
of everywhere else that I've been.

00:08:26.466 --> 00:08:29.191
When I got to university,
I met a fellow poet

00:08:29.215 --> 00:08:32.707
who shared my belief in the magic
of spoken-word poetry.

00:08:32.731 --> 00:08:34.725
And actually, Phil Kaye and I

00:08:34.749 --> 00:08:37.342
coincidentally also share
the same last name.

00:08:37.366 --> 00:08:40.101
When I was in high school I had
created Project V.O.I.C.E.

00:08:40.125 --> 00:08:42.976
as a way to encourage my friends
to do spoken word with me.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.976
But Phil and I decided to reinvent
Project V.O.I.C.E.,

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:47.976
this time changing the mission

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.976
to using spoken-word poetry
as a way to entertain,

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:52.976
educate and inspire.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.715
We stayed full-time students,
but in between we traveled,

00:08:55.739 --> 00:08:57.567
performing and teaching

00:08:57.591 --> 00:08:59.975
nine-year-olds to MFA candidates,

00:08:59.999 --> 00:09:03.345
from California to Indiana to India

00:09:03.369 --> 00:09:05.976
to a public high school
just up the street from campus.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:07.977
And we saw over and over

00:09:08.001 --> 00:09:09.976
the way that spoken-word poetry

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:11.415
cracks open locks.

00:09:12.101 --> 00:09:16.220
But it turns out sometimes,
poetry can be really scary.

00:09:16.823 --> 00:09:18.315
Turns out sometimes,

00:09:18.339 --> 00:09:20.976
you have to trick teenagers
into writing poetry.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:24.465
So I came up with lists.
Everyone can write lists.

00:09:24.489 --> 00:09:26.515
And the first list that I assign

00:09:26.539 --> 00:09:29.219
is "10 Things I Know to be True."

00:09:29.822 --> 00:09:32.178
And here's what happens,
you would discover it too

00:09:32.202 --> 00:09:34.321
if we all started sharing
our lists out loud.

00:09:34.345 --> 00:09:39.675
At a certain point, you would realize
that someone has the exact same thing,

00:09:39.699 --> 00:09:41.676
or one thing very similar,

00:09:41.700 --> 00:09:42.976
to something on your list.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:44.976
And then someone else

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.570
has something the complete
opposite of yours.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:51.000
Third, someone has something
you've never even heard of before.

00:09:51.024 --> 00:09:54.469
Fourth, someone has something
you thought you knew everything about,

00:09:54.493 --> 00:09:56.976
but they're introducing
a new angle of looking at it.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:00.048
And I tell people that this is
where great stories start from --

00:10:00.072 --> 00:10:02.200
these four intersections

00:10:02.224 --> 00:10:03.976
of what you're passionate about

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.383
and what others might be invested in.

00:10:06.407 --> 00:10:08.976
And most people respond
really well to this exercise.

00:10:09.676 --> 00:10:12.121
But one of my students,
a freshman named Charlotte,

00:10:12.145 --> 00:10:13.605
was not convinced.

00:10:14.041 --> 00:10:17.667
Charlotte was very good at writing lists,
but she refused to write any poems.

00:10:17.691 --> 00:10:19.979
"Miss," she'd say,
"I'm just not interesting.

00:10:20.003 --> 00:10:22.430
I don't have anything interesting to say."

00:10:23.111 --> 00:10:24.976
So I assigned her list after list,

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:26.651
and one day I assigned the list

00:10:26.675 --> 00:10:28.651
"10 Things I Should Have Learned by Now."

00:10:29.293 --> 00:10:31.203
Number three on Charlotte's list was,

00:10:31.227 --> 00:10:33.244
"I should have learned
not to crush on guys

00:10:33.268 --> 00:10:34.743
three times my age."

00:10:35.695 --> 00:10:37.068
I asked her what that meant,

00:10:37.092 --> 00:10:39.530
and she said, "Miss,
it's kind of a long story."

00:10:39.554 --> 00:10:42.378
And I said, "Charlotte, it sounds
pretty interesting to me."

00:10:42.402 --> 00:10:44.156
And so she wrote her first poem,

00:10:44.180 --> 00:10:47.757
a love poem unlike any
I had ever heard before.

00:10:47.781 --> 00:10:50.202
And the poem began,

00:10:50.226 --> 00:10:52.344
"Anderson Cooper is a gorgeous man."

00:10:52.368 --> 00:10:54.837
(Laughter)

00:10:54.861 --> 00:10:56.478
"Did you see him on 60 Minutes,

00:10:56.502 --> 00:10:58.282
racing Michael Phelps in a pool --

00:10:58.306 --> 00:10:59.976
nothing but swim trunks on --

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:03.132
diving in the water, determined
to beat this swimming champion?

00:11:03.156 --> 00:11:05.545
After the race, he tossed
his wet, cloud-white hair

00:11:05.569 --> 00:11:06.828
and said, 'You're a god.'

00:11:06.852 --> 00:11:08.976
No, Anderson, you're the god."

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:10.976
(Laughter)

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:14.873
(Applause)

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:18.792
Now, I know that the number one
rule to being cool

00:11:18.816 --> 00:11:20.703
is to seem unfazed,

00:11:20.727 --> 00:11:23.923
to never admit that anything scares you

00:11:23.947 --> 00:11:25.556
or impresses you or excites you.

00:11:25.580 --> 00:11:26.976
Somebody once told me

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.149
it's like walking through life like this.

00:11:29.173 --> 00:11:30.547
You protect yourself

00:11:30.571 --> 00:11:33.809
from all the unexpected miseries
or hurt that might show up.

00:11:33.833 --> 00:11:36.463
But I try to walk through life like this.

00:11:36.487 --> 00:11:39.354
And yes, that means catching
all of those miseries and hurt,

00:11:39.378 --> 00:11:43.104
but it also means
that when beautiful, amazing things

00:11:43.128 --> 00:11:44.545
just fall out of the sky,

00:11:44.569 --> 00:11:45.976
I'm ready to catch them.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.381
I use spoken word to help my students

00:11:48.405 --> 00:11:49.976
rediscover wonder,

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.766
to fight their instincts
to be cool and unfazed

00:11:52.790 --> 00:11:56.305
and, instead, actively pursue being
engaged with what goes on around them,

00:11:56.329 --> 00:11:59.622
so that they can reinterpret
and create something from it.

00:11:59.646 --> 00:12:01.939
It's not that I think
that spoken-word poetry

00:12:01.963 --> 00:12:03.439
is the ideal art form.

00:12:03.463 --> 00:12:06.598
I'm always trying to find
the best way to tell each story.

00:12:06.622 --> 00:12:09.647
I write musicals; I make short films
alongside my poems.

00:12:09.671 --> 00:12:11.845
But I teach spoken-word poetry

00:12:11.869 --> 00:12:13.814
because it's accessible.

00:12:13.838 --> 00:12:17.286
Not everyone can read music
or owns a camera,

00:12:17.310 --> 00:12:19.675
but everyone can communicate in some way,

00:12:19.699 --> 00:12:23.476
and everyone has stories
that the rest of us can learn from.

00:12:23.500 --> 00:12:26.732
Plus, spoken-word poetry allows
for immediate connection.

00:12:26.756 --> 00:12:28.951
It's not uncommon
to feel like you're alone

00:12:28.975 --> 00:12:30.568
or that nobody understands you,

00:12:30.592 --> 00:12:31.976
but spoken word teaches

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.731
that if you have the ability
to express yourself

00:12:34.755 --> 00:12:37.572
and the courage to present
those stories and opinions,

00:12:37.596 --> 00:12:38.976
you could be rewarded

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:40.976
with a room full of your peers,

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.286
or your community, who will listen.

00:12:43.310 --> 00:12:45.605
And maybe even a giant girl in a hoodie

00:12:45.629 --> 00:12:47.675
who will connect with what you've shared.

00:12:47.699 --> 00:12:49.976
And that is an amazing
realization to have,

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:51.846
especially when you're 14.

00:12:52.466 --> 00:12:53.976
Plus, now with YouTube,

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.642
that connection's not even limited
to the room we're in.

00:12:56.666 --> 00:12:59.888
I'm so lucky that there's
this archive of performances

00:12:59.912 --> 00:13:01.576
that I can share with my students.

00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:04.045
It allows for even more opportunities

00:13:04.069 --> 00:13:07.472
for them to find a poet or a poem
that they connect to.

00:13:07.867 --> 00:13:10.334
Once you've figured this out,

00:13:10.358 --> 00:13:12.501
it is tempting to keep
writing the same poem,

00:13:12.525 --> 00:13:14.708
or keep telling the same story,
over and over,

00:13:14.732 --> 00:13:17.311
once you've figured out
that it will gain you applause.

00:13:17.335 --> 00:13:20.318
It's not enough to just teach
that you can express yourself.

00:13:20.342 --> 00:13:21.976
You have to grow and explore

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.297
and take risks and challenge yourself.

00:13:24.321 --> 00:13:26.976
And that is step three:

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:28.976
infusing the work you're doing

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:31.048
with the specific things
that make you you,

00:13:31.072 --> 00:13:33.402
even while those things
are always changing.

00:13:33.709 --> 00:13:36.140
Because step three never ends.

00:13:36.549 --> 00:13:38.553
But you don't get to start on step three,

00:13:38.577 --> 00:13:40.741
until you take step one first:

00:13:40.765 --> 00:13:41.778
"I can."

00:13:41.802 --> 00:13:43.524
I travel a lot while I'm teaching,

00:13:43.548 --> 00:13:47.050
and I don't always get to watch
all of my students reach their step three,

00:13:47.074 --> 00:13:48.792
but I was very lucky with Charlotte,

00:13:48.816 --> 00:13:51.456
that I got to watch her journey
unfold the way it did.

00:13:51.480 --> 00:13:52.812
I watched her realize

00:13:52.836 --> 00:13:56.612
that, by putting the things that she knows
to be true into the work she's doing,

00:13:56.636 --> 00:13:59.076
she can create poems
that only Charlotte can write,

00:13:59.100 --> 00:14:02.039
about eyeballs and elevators
and Dora the Explorer.

00:14:02.412 --> 00:14:04.753
And I'm trying to tell
stories only I can tell --

00:14:04.777 --> 00:14:05.976
like this story.

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:09.264
I spent a lot of time thinking
about the best way to tell this story,

00:14:09.288 --> 00:14:10.730
and I wondered if the best way

00:14:10.754 --> 00:14:12.857
was going to be
a PowerPoint, a short film --

00:14:12.881 --> 00:14:15.658
And where exactly was the beginning,
the middle or the end?

00:14:15.682 --> 00:14:18.055
I wondered whether I'd get
to the end of this talk

00:14:18.079 --> 00:14:20.633
and finally have
figured it all out, or not.

00:14:21.308 --> 00:14:24.572
And I always thought that my beginning
was at the Bowery Poetry Club,

00:14:24.596 --> 00:14:26.672
but it's possible
that it was much earlier.

00:14:26.696 --> 00:14:27.976
In preparing for TED,

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.239
I discovered this diary page
in an old journal.

00:14:30.263 --> 00:14:33.445
I think December 54th
was probably supposed to be 24th.

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:35.976
It's clear that when I was a child,

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:38.253
I definitely walked
through life like this.

00:14:38.277 --> 00:14:39.587
I think that we all did.

00:14:40.063 --> 00:14:42.976
I would like to help others
rediscover that wonder --

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:45.465
to want to engage with it,
to want to learn,

00:14:45.489 --> 00:14:47.376
to want to share what they've learned,

00:14:47.400 --> 00:14:49.076
what they've figured out to be true

00:14:49.100 --> 00:14:51.076
and what they're still figuring out.

00:14:51.100 --> 00:14:53.262
So I'd like to close with this poem.

00:14:54.806 --> 00:14:57.387
When they bombed Hiroshima,

00:14:57.411 --> 00:15:00.466
the explosion formed a mini-supernova,

00:15:00.490 --> 00:15:03.544
so every living animal, human or plant

00:15:03.568 --> 00:15:07.246
that received direct contact
with the rays from that sun

00:15:07.270 --> 00:15:08.866
was instantly turned to ash.

00:15:09.152 --> 00:15:11.241
And what was left
of the city soon followed.

00:15:11.265 --> 00:15:13.669
The long-lasting damage
of nuclear radiation

00:15:13.693 --> 00:15:16.610
caused an entire city and its population

00:15:16.634 --> 00:15:18.478
to turn into powder.

00:15:19.146 --> 00:15:22.759
When I was born, my mom says
I looked around the whole hospital room

00:15:22.783 --> 00:15:25.976
with a stare that said,
"This? I've done this before."

00:15:26.424 --> 00:15:28.078
She says I have old eyes.

00:15:28.340 --> 00:15:30.976
When my Grandpa Genji died,
I was only five years old,

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:33.149
but I took my mom
by the hand and told her,

00:15:33.173 --> 00:15:35.713
"Don't worry, he'll come back as a baby."

00:15:36.284 --> 00:15:39.448
And yet, for someone
who's apparently done this already,

00:15:39.472 --> 00:15:41.976
I still haven't figured anything out yet.

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:44.976
My knees still buckle
every time I get on a stage.

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:46.976
My self-confidence can be measured out

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:48.976
in teaspoons mixed into my poetry,

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:51.976
and it still always
tastes funny in my mouth.

00:15:52.302 --> 00:15:55.523
But in Hiroshima, some people
were wiped clean away,

00:15:55.547 --> 00:15:58.301
leaving only a wristwatch or a diary page.

00:15:58.325 --> 00:16:01.757
So no matter that I have inhibitions
to fill all my pockets,

00:16:01.781 --> 00:16:02.976
I keep trying,

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:04.976
hoping that one day I'll write a poem

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:07.143
I can be proud to let sit
in a museum exhibit

00:16:07.167 --> 00:16:09.404
as the only proof I existed.

00:16:09.855 --> 00:16:12.976
My parents named me Sarah,
which is a biblical name.

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:17.357
In the original story, God told Sarah
she could do something impossible, and --

00:16:17.825 --> 00:16:19.079
she laughed,

00:16:19.103 --> 00:16:20.680
because the first Sarah,

00:16:20.704 --> 00:16:23.048
she didn't know what to do
with impossible.

00:16:23.072 --> 00:16:24.272
And me?

00:16:24.456 --> 00:16:25.976
Well, neither do I,

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:27.976
but I see the impossible every day.

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:30.905
Impossible is trying
to connect in this world,

00:16:30.929 --> 00:16:34.033
trying to hold onto others while things
are blowing up around you,

00:16:34.057 --> 00:16:35.733
knowing that while you're speaking,

00:16:35.757 --> 00:16:38.815
they aren't just waiting for their turn
to talk -- they hear you.

00:16:38.839 --> 00:16:40.330
They feel exactly what you feel

00:16:40.354 --> 00:16:41.976
at the same time that you feel it.

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:44.477
It's what I strive for every time
I open my mouth --

00:16:44.501 --> 00:16:46.581
that impossible connection.

00:16:46.605 --> 00:16:48.976
There's this piece of wall in Hiroshima

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:51.742
that was completely burnt
black by the radiation.

00:16:51.766 --> 00:16:54.440
But on the front step,
a person who was sitting there

00:16:54.464 --> 00:16:56.734
blocked the rays from hitting the stone.

00:16:56.758 --> 00:16:57.976
The only thing left now

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:00.508
is a permanent shadow of positive light.

00:17:00.925 --> 00:17:01.976
After the A-bomb,

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:04.588
specialists said it would take 75 years

00:17:04.612 --> 00:17:06.976
for the radiation-damaged
soil of Hiroshima City

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:08.976
to ever grow anything again.

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:12.365
But that spring, there were
new buds popping up from the earth.

00:17:12.389 --> 00:17:14.392
When I meet you, in that moment,

00:17:14.416 --> 00:17:16.252
I'm no longer a part of your future.

00:17:16.276 --> 00:17:18.515
I start quickly becoming
part of your past.

00:17:18.539 --> 00:17:20.976
But in that instant,
I get to share your present.

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:22.976
And you, you get to share mine.

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:24.976
And that is the greatest present of all.

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:27.262
So if you tell me
I can do the impossible --

00:17:27.894 --> 00:17:29.388
I'll probably laugh at you.

00:17:29.412 --> 00:17:31.500
I don't know if I can change
the world yet,

00:17:31.524 --> 00:17:33.543
because I don't know that much about it --

00:17:33.567 --> 00:17:36.157
and I don't know that much
about reincarnation either,

00:17:36.181 --> 00:17:38.025
but if you make me laugh hard enough,

00:17:38.049 --> 00:17:40.277
sometimes I forget what century I'm in.

00:17:40.301 --> 00:17:43.760
This isn't my first time here.
This isn't my last time here.

00:17:43.784 --> 00:17:45.696
These aren't the last words I'll share.

00:17:45.720 --> 00:17:47.976
But just in case, I'm trying my hardest

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:50.411
to get it right this time around.

00:17:50.896 --> 00:17:51.999
Thank you.

00:17:52.023 --> 00:17:53.853
(Applause)

00:17:53.877 --> 00:17:54.909
Thank you.

00:17:54.933 --> 00:17:58.166
(Applause)

00:17:58.190 --> 00:17:59.337
Thank you.

00:17:59.361 --> 00:18:02.198
(Applause)

00:18:02.222 --> 00:18:03.342
Thank you.

00:18:03.366 --> 00:18:05.690
(Applause)
