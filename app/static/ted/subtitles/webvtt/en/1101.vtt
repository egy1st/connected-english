00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
I was only four years old

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
when I saw my mother load a washing machine

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
for the very first time in her life.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
That was a great day for my mother.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
My mother and father had been saving money for years

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
to be able to buy that machine,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
and the first day it was going to be used,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
even Grandma was invited

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
to see the machine.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
And Grandma was even more excited.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Throughout her life

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
she had been heating water with firewood,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
and she had hand washed laundry

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
for seven children.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
And now she was going to watch

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
electricity do that work.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
My mother carefully opened the door,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
and she loaded the laundry

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
into the machine,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
like this.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
And then, when she closed the door,

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
Grandma said, "No, no, no, no.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
Let me, let me push the button."

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
And Grandma pushed the button,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
and she said, "Oh, fantastic!

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
I want to see this! Give me a chair!

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
Give me a chair! I want to see it,"

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
and she sat down in front of the machine,

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
and she watched the entire washing program.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
She was mesmerized.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
To my grandmother,

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
the washing machine was a miracle.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
Today, in Sweden and other rich countries,

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
people are using

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
so many different machines.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
Look, the homes are full of machines.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
I can't even name them all.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
And they also, when they want to travel,

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
they use flying machines

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
that can take them to remote destinations.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
And yet, in the world, there are so many people

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
who still heat the water on fire,

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
and they cook their food on fire.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
Sometimes they don't even have enough food,

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000
and they live below the poverty line.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
There are two billion fellow human beings

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
who live on less than two dollars a day.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
And the richest people over there --

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
there's one billion people --

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.000
and they live above what I call the "air line,"

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000
because they spend more than $80 a day

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
on their consumption.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
But this is just one, two, three billion people,

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000
and obviously there are seven billion people in the world,

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000
so there must be one, two, three, four billion people more

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000
who live in between the poverty and the air line.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000
They have electricity,

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000
but the question is, how many have washing machines?

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000
I've done the scrutiny of market data,

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
and I've found that, indeed,

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
the washing machine has penetrated below the air line,

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
and today there's an additional one billion people out there

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
who live above the "wash line."

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
(Laughter)

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.000
And they consume more than $40 per day.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
So two billion have access to washing machines.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
And the remaining five billion,

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
how do they wash?

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
Or, to be more precise,

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
how do most of the women in the world wash?

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.000
Because it remains hard work for women to wash.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000
They wash like this: by hand.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.000
It's a hard, time-consuming labor,

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000
which they have to do for hours every week.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000
And sometimes they also have to bring water from far away

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
to do the laundry at home,

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.000
or they have to bring the laundry away to a stream far off.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.000
And they want the washing machine.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.000
They don't want to spend such a large part of their life

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
doing this hard work

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000
with so relatively low productivity.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000
And there's nothing different in their wish

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000
than it was for my grandma.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.000
Look here, two generations ago in Sweden --

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000
picking water from the stream,

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000
heating with firewood and washing like that.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000
They want the washing machine in exactly the same way.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.000
But when I lecture to environmentally-concerned students,

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:55.000
they tell me, "No, everybody in the world cannot have cars and washing machines."

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000
How can we tell this woman

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000
that she ain't going to have a washing machine?

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
And then I ask my students,

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000
I've asked them -- over the last two years I've asked,

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000
"How many of you doesn't use a car?"

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000
And some of them proudly raise their hand

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000
and say, "I don't use a car."

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000
And then I put the really tough question:

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000
"How many of you

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000
hand-wash your jeans and your bed sheets?"

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.000
And no one raised their hand.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.000
Even the hardcore in the green movement

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000
use washing machines.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.000
(Laughter)

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
So how come [this is] something that everyone uses

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000
and they think others will not stop it? What is special with this?

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000
I had to do an analysis about the energy used in the world.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000
Here we are.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000
Look here, you see the seven billion people up there:

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000
the air people, the wash people,

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.000
the bulb people and the fire people.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000
One unit like this

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.000
is an energy unit of fossil fuel --

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
oil, coal or gas.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.000
That's what most of electricity and the energy in the world is.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.000
And it's 12 units used in the entire world,

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.000
and the richest one billion, they use six of them.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.000
Half of the energy is used by one seventh of the world's population.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000
And these ones who have washing machines,

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000
but not a house full of other machines,

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000
they use two.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000
This group uses three, one each.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000
And they also have electricity.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000
And over there they don't even use one each.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000
That makes 12 of them.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000
But the main concern

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.000
for the environmentally-interested students -- and they are right --

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000
is about the future.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000
What are the trends? If we just prolong the trends,

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000
without any real advanced analysis, to 2050,

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.000
there are two things that can increase the energy use.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.000
First, population growth.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000
Second, economic growth.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.000
Population growth will mainly occur among the poorest people here

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000
because they have high child mortality

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000
and they have many children per woman.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.000
And [with] that you will get two extra,

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000
but that won't change the energy use very much.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.000
What will happen is economic growth.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000
The best of here in the emerging economies --

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000
I call them the New East --

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000
they will jump the air line.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000
"Wopp!" they will say.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.000
And they will start to use as much as the Old West are doing already.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.000
And these people, they want the washing machine.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000
I told you. They'll go there.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000
And they will double their energy use.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.000
And we hope that the poor people will get into the electric light.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000
And they'll get a two-child family without a stop in population growth.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.000
But the total energy consumption

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.000
will increase to 22 units.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.000
And these 22 units --

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.000
still the richest people use most of it.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000
So what needs to be done?

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000
Because the risk,

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.000
the high probability of climate change is real.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.000
It's real.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:40.000
Of course they must be more energy-efficient.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000
They must change behavior in some way.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000
They must also start to produce green energy,

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.000
much more green energy.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:49.000
But until they have the same energy consumption per person,

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000
they shouldn't give advice to others --

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000
what to do and what not to do.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000
(Applause)

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:59.000
Here we can get more green energy all over.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000
This is what we hope may happen.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:04.000
It's a real challenge in the future.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:07.000
But I can assure you that this woman in the favela in Rio,

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000
she wants a washing machine.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.000
She's very happy about her minister of energy

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.000
that provided electricity to everyone --

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.000
so happy that she even voted for her.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.000
And she became Dilma Rousseff,

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.000
the president-elect

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.000
of one of the biggest democracies in the world --

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:26.000
moving from minister of energy to president.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.000
If you have democracy,

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000
people will vote for washing machines.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000
They love them.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000
And what's the magic with them?

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.000
My mother explained the magic with this machine

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.000
the very, very first day.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.000
She said, "Now Hans,

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.000
we have loaded the laundry.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.000
The machine will make the work.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.000
And now we can go to the library."

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.000
Because this is the magic:

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.000
you load the laundry,

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.000
and what do you get out of the machine?

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:58.000
You get books out of the machines,

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000
children's books.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000
And mother got time to read for me.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000
She loved this. I got the "ABC's" --

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:07.000
this is where I started my career as a professor,

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.000
when my mother had time to read for me.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.000
And she also got books for herself.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.000
She managed to study English

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.000
and learn that as a foreign language.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.000
And she read so many novels,

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:20.000
so many different novels here.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:23.000
And we really, we really loved this machine.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.000
And what we said, my mother and me,

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:30.000
"Thank you industrialization.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000
Thank you steel mill.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.000
Thank you power station.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:37.000
And thank you chemical processing industry

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.000
