WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
I just came back from a community

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
that holds the secret to human survival.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
It's a place where women run the show,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
have sex to say hello,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
and play rules the day --

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
where fun is serious business.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
And no, this isn't Burning Man

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
or San Francisco.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
(Laughter)

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Ladies and gentlemen, meet your cousins.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
This is the world of wild bonobos

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
in the jungles of Congo.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Bonobos are, together with chimpanzees,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
your living closest relative.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
That means we all share a common ancestor,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
an evolutionary grandmother,

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
who lived around six million years ago.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
Now, chimpanzees are well-known

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
for their aggression.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
(Laughter)

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
But unfortunately,

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
we have made too much of an emphasis

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
of this aspect

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
in our narratives of human evolution.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
But bonobos show us

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
the other side of the coin.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
While chimpanzees

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
are dominated by big, scary guys,

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
bonobo society

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
is run by empowered females.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
These guys have really worked something out,

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
since this leads to a highly tolerant society

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
where fatal violence

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
has not been observed yet.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
But unfortunately,

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
bonobos are the least understood

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
of the great apes.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
They live in the depths of the Congolese jungle,

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
and it has been very difficult to study them.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
The Congo is a paradox --

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.000
a land of extraordinary biodiversity and beauty,

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
but also the heart of darkness itself --

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000
the scene of a violent conflict

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
that has raged for decades

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
and claimed nearly as many lives

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
as the First World War.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
Not surprisingly,

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.000
this destruction also endangers bonobo survival.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
Bushmeat trades and forest loss

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
means we couldn't fill a small stadium

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
with all the bonobos that are left in the world --

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
and we're not even sure of that to be honest.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.000
Yet, in this land of violence and chaos,

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
you can hear hidden laughter

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
swaying the trees.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000
Who are these cousins?

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.000
We know them as the "make love, not war" apes

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
since they have frequent, promiscuous

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
and bisexual sex

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
to manage conflict

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
and solve social issues.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
Now, I'm not saying this is the solution

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000
to all of humanity's problems --

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
since there's more to bonobo life

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
than the Kama Sutra.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
Bonobos, like humans,

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
love to play throughout their entire lives.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
Play is not just child's games.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
For us and them,

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000
play is foundational for bonding relationships

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
and fostering tolerance.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
It's where we learn to trust

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000
and where we learn about the rules of the game.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000
Play increases creativity

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000
and resilience,

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000
and it's all about the generation of diversity --

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
diversity of interactions,

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000
diversity of behaviors,

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.000
diversity of connections.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
And when you watch bonobo play,

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.000
you're seeing the very evolutionary roots

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000
of human laughter, dance

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000
and ritual.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000
Play is the glue

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000
that binds us together.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000
Now, I don't know how you play,

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000
but I want to show you a couple of unique clips

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000
fresh from the wild.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.000
First, it's a ball game bonobo-style --

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.000
and I do not mean football.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000
So here,

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000
we have a young female and a male

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.000
engaged in a chase game.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
Have a look what she's doing.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000
It might be the evolutionary origin of the phrase,

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000
"she's got him by the balls."

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.000
(Laughter)

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.000
Only I think that he's rather loving it here, right?

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000
Yeah.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000
(Laughter)

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000
So sex play is common

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000
in both bonobos and humans.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000
And this video is really interesting

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000
because it shows --

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000
this video's really interesting

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
because it shows the inventiveness

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000
of bringing unusual elements into play --

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.000
such as testicles --

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.000
and also how play both requires trust

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.000
and fosters trust --

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000
while at the same time being tremendous fun.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000
But play's a shapeshifter.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.000
(Laughter)

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000
Play's a shapeshifter,

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000
and it can take many forms,

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000
some of which are more quiet,

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000
imaginative, curious --

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.000
maybe where wonder is discovered anew.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000
And I want you to see,

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000
this is Fuku, a young female,

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000
and she is quietly playing with water.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000
I think, like her,

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000
we sometimes play alone,

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000
and we explore the boundaries

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.000
of our inner and our outer worlds.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000
And it's that playful curiosity

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000
that drives us to explore, drives us to interact,

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.000
and then the unexpected connections we form

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.000
are the real hotbed for creativity.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.000
So these are just small tasters

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000
into the insights that bonobo give us

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.000
to our past and present.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.000
But they also hold a secret for our future,

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000
a future where we need to adapt

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.000
to an increasingly challenging world

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.000
through greater creativity

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000
and greater cooperation.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.000
The secret is that play is the key

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000
to these capacities.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000
In other words,

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.000
play is our adaptive wildcard.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000
In order to adapt successfully

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.000
to a changing world,

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.000
we need to play.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.000
But will we make the most of our playfulness?

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000
Play is not frivolous.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000
Play's essential.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.000
For bonobos and humans alike,

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.000
life is not just red in tooth and claw.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.000
In times when it seems least appropriate to play,

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.000
it might be the times when it is most urgent.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.000
And so, my fellow primates,

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.000
let us embrace this gift from evolution

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000
and play together,

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:34.000
as we rediscover creativity,

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000
fellowship and wonder.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.000
Thank you.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.000
(Applause)
