00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Today I want to talk about design,

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
but not design as we usually think about it.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
I want to talk about what is happening now

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
in our scientific, biotechnological culture,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
where, for really the first time in history,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
we have the power to design bodies,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
to design animal bodies,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
to design human bodies.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
In the history of our planet,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
there have been three great waves of evolution.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
The first wave of evolution

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
is what we think of as Darwinian evolution.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
So, as you all know,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
species lived in particular ecological niches

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
and particular environments,

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
and the pressures of those environments

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
selected which changes,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
through random mutation in species,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
were going to be preserved.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Then human beings stepped out

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
of the Darwinian flow of evolutionary history

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
and created the second great wave of evolution,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
which was we changed the environment

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
in which we evolved.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
We altered our ecological niche

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
by creating civilization.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
And that has been the second great --

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
couple 100,000 years, 150,000 years --

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
flow of our evolution.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
By changing our environment,

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
we put new pressures

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
on our bodies to evolve.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
Whether it was through settling down in agricultural communities,

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
all the way through modern medicine,

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
we have changed our own evolution.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
Now we're entering a third great wave

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
of evolutionary history,

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
which has been called many things:

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
"intentional evolution,"

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
"evolution by design" --

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
very different than intelligent design --

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
whereby we are actually now

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000
intentionally designing and altering

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
the physiological forms that inhabit our planet.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
So I want to take you through a kind of whirlwind tour of that

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
and then at the end talk a little bit

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000
about what some of the implications are for us

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
and for our species, as well as our cultures,

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
because of this change.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
Now we actually have been doing it for a long time.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
We started selectively breeding animals

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
many, many thousands of years ago.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
And if you think of dogs for example,

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.000
dogs are now intentionally-designed creatures.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
There isn't a dog on this earth that's a natural creature.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
Dogs are the result

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
of selectively breeding traits that we like.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
But we had to do it the hard way in the old days

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
by choosing offspring that looked a particular way

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
and then breeding them.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
We don't have to do it that way anymore.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000
This is a beefalo.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.000
A beefalo is a buffalo-cattle hybrid.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
And they are now making them,

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
and someday, perhaps pretty soon,

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
you will have beefalo patties

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
in your local supermarket.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
This is a geep,

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000
a goat-sheep hybrid.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000
The scientists that made this cute little creature

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000
ended up slaughtering it and eating it afterwards.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000
I think they said it tasted like chicken.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
This is a cama.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.000
A cama is a camel-llama hybrid,

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000
created to try to get the hardiness of a camel

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
with some of the personality traits

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
of a llama.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000
And they are now using these in certain cultures.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
Then there's the liger.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
This is the largest cat in the world --

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
the lion-tiger hybrid.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000
It's bigger than a tiger.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000
And in the case of the liger,

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000
there actually have been one or two that have been seen in the wild.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000
But these were created by scientists

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000
using both selective breeding and genetic technology.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000
And then finally, everybody's favorite,

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000
the zorse.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.000
None of this is Photoshopped. These are real creatures.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000
And so one of the things we've been doing

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.000
is using genetic enhancement,

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000
or genetic manipulation,

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000
of normal selective breeding

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000
pushed a little bit through genetics.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.000
And if that were all this was about,

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000
then it would be an interesting thing.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.000
But something much, much more powerful

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.000
is happening now.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.000
These are normal mammalian cells

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.000
genetically engineered with a bioluminescent gene

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000
taken out of deep-sea jellyfish.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.000
We all know that some deep-sea creatures glow.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000
Well, they've now taken that gene, that bioluminescent gene,

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000
and put it into mammal cells.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000
These are normal cells.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000
And what you see here

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000
is these cells glowing in the dark

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.000
under certain wavelengths of light.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.000
Once they could do that with cells, they could do it with organisms.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:49.000
So they did it with mouse pups,

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000
kittens.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:55.000
And by the way, the reason the kittens here are orange and these are green

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.000
is because that's a bioluminescent gene from coral,

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.000
while this is from jellyfish.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.000
They did it with pigs.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000
They did it with puppies.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000
And, in fact,

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000
they did it with monkeys.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000
And if you can do it with monkeys --

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.000
though the great leap in trying to genetically manipulate

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000
is actually between monkeys and apes --

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000
if they can do it in monkeys,

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000
they can probably figure out how to do it in apes,

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:25.000
which means they can do it in human beings.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.000
In other words, it is theoretically possible

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.000
that before too long we will be biotechnologically capable

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.000
of creating human beings

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.000
that glow in the dark.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000
Be easier to find us at night.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.000
And in fact, right now in many states,

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.000
you can go out and you can buy bioluminescent pets.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.000
These are zebra fish. They're normally black and silver.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.000
These are zebra fish that have been genetically engineered

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.000
to be yellow, green, red,

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.000
and they are actually available now in certain states.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000
Other states have banned them.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000
Nobody knows what to do with these kinds of creatures.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.000
There is no area of the government -- not the EPA or the FDA --

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:10.000
that controls genetically-engineered pets.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.000
And so some states have decided to allow them,

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:17.000
some states have decided to ban them.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.000
Some of you may have read

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.000
about the FDA's consideration right now

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.000
of genetically-engineered salmon.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000
The salmon on top

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000
is a genetically engineered Chinook salmon,

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000
using a gene from these salmon

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000
and from one other fish that we eat,

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000
to make it grow much faster

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000
using a lot less feed.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.000
And right now the FDA is trying to make a final decision

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.000
on whether, pretty soon, you could be eating this fish --

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000
it'll be sold in the stores.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.000
And before you get too worried about it,

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.000
here in the United States,

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.000
the majority of food you buy in the supermarket

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:54.000
already has genetically-modified components to it.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000
So even as we worry about it,

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.000
we have allowed it to go on in this country -- much different in Europe --

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000
without any regulation,

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:04.000
and even without any identification on the package.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:08.000
These are all the first cloned animals

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.000
of their type.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.000
So in the lower right here,

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.000
you have Dolly, the first cloned sheep --

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.000
now happily stuffed in a museum in Edinburgh;

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.000
Ralph the rat, the first cloned rat;

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:23.000
CC the cat, for cloned cat;

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.000
Snuppy, the first cloned dog --

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:28.000
Snuppy for Seoul National University puppy --

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000
created in South Korea

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000
by the very same man that some of you may remember

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.000
had to end up resigning in disgrace

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:38.000
because he claimed he had cloned a human embryo, which he had not.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.000
He actually was the first person

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.000
to clone a dog, which is a very difficult thing to do,

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:46.000
because dog genomes are very plastic.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:49.000
This is Prometea, the first cloned horse.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.000
It's a Haflinger horse cloned in Italy,

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.000
a real "gold ring" of cloning,

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:56.000
because there are many horses that win important races

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.000
who are geldings.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:01.000
In other words, the equipment to put them out to stud

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.000
has been removed.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.000
But if you can clone that horse,

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:08.000
you can have both the advantage of having a gelding run in the race

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:11.000
and his identical genetic duplicate

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:14.000
can then be put out to stud.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.000
These were the first cloned calves,

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.000
the first cloned grey wolves,

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.000
and then, finally,

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.000
the first cloned piglets:

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:26.000
Alexis, Chista, Carrel, Janie and Dotcom.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000
(Laughter)

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.000
In addition, we've started to use cloning technology

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.000
to try to save endangered species.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.000
This is the use of animals now

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:41.000
to create drugs and other things in their bodies

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.000
that we want to create.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.000
So with antithrombin in that goat --

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.000
that goat has been genetically modified

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:50.000
so that the molecules of its milk

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:53.000
actually include the molecule of antithrombin

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:56.000
that GTC Genetics wants to create.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:59.000
And then in addition, transgenic pigs, knockout pigs,

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:03.000
from the National Institute of Animal Science in South Korea,

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:06.000
are pigs that they are going to use, in fact,

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:10.000
to try to create all kinds of drugs

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:14.000
and other industrial types of chemicals

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.000
that they want the blood and the milk

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.000
of these animals

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.000
to produce for them,

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:23.000
instead of producing them in an industrial way.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.000
These are two creatures

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:29.000
that were created

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.000
in order to save endangered species.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.000
The guar

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:37.000
is an endangered Southeast Asian ungulate.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.000
A somatic cell, a body cell,

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.000
was taken from its body,

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.000
gestated in the ovum of a cow,

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:47.000
and then that cow gave birth to a guar.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.000
Same thing happened with the mouflon,

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:52.000
where it's an endangered species of sheep.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:58.000
It was gestated in a regular sheep body,

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:01.000
which actually raises an interesting biological problem.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.000
We have two kinds of DNA in our bodies.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.000
We have our nucleic DNA

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.000
that everybody thinks of as our DNA,

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.000
but we also have DNA in our mitochondria,

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:12.000
which are the energy packets of the cell.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:15.000
That DNA is passed down through our mothers.

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:18.000
So really, what you end up having here

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.000
is not a guar and not a mouflon,

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.000
but a guar

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.000
with cow mitochondria,

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.000
and therefore cow mitochondrial DNA,

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:29.000
and a mouflon with another species of sheep's

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.000
mitochondrial DNA.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:34.000
These are really hybrids, not pure animals.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:37.000
And it raises the question of how we're going to define animal species

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.000
in the age of biotechnology --

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:42.000
a question that we're not really sure yet

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.000
how to solve.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.000
This lovely creature

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:49.000
is an Asian cockroach.

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.000
And what they've done here

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:55.000
is they've put electrodes in its ganglia and its brain

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.000
and then a transmitter on top,

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.000
and it's on a big computer tracking ball.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.000
And now, using a joystick,

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:03.000
they can send this creature

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:05.000
around the lab

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:07.000
and control whether it goes left or right,

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.000
forwards or backwards.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.000
They've created a kind of insect bot,

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.000
or bugbot.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:16.000
It gets worse than that -- or perhaps better than that.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:19.000
This actually is one of DARPA's very important --

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.000
DARPA is the Defense Research Agency --

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.000
one of their projects.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.000
These goliath beetles

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.000
are wired in their wings.

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.000
They have a computer chip strapped to their backs,

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:33.000
and they can fly these creatures around the lab.

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.000
They can make them go left, right. They can make them take off.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:37.000
They can't actually make them land.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.000
They put them about one inch above the ground,

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.000
and then they shut everything off and they go pfft.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:44.000
But it's the closest they can get to a landing.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:48.000
And in fact, this technology has gotten so developed

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.000
that this creature --

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.000
this is a moth --

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.000
this is the moth in its pupa stage,

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.000
and that's when they put the wires in

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:59.000
and they put in the computer technology,

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:02.000
so that when the moth actually emerges as a moth,

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:05.000
it is already prewired.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:08.000
The wires are already in its body,

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:11.000
and they can just hook it up to their technology,

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.000
and now they've got these bugbots

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:15.000
that they can send out for surveillance.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:17.000
They can put little cameras on them

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:19.000
and perhaps someday deliver

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:21.000
other kinds of ordinance

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:24.000
to warzones.

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:26.000
It's not just insects.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.000
This is the ratbot, or the robo-rat

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:31.000
by Sanjiv Talwar at SUNY Downstate.

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:33.000
Again, it's got technology --

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:36.000
it's got electrodes going into its left and right hemispheres;

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:39.000
it's got a camera on top of its head.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:41.000
The scientists can make this creature

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.000
go left, right.

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:46.000
They have it running through mazes, controlling where it's going.

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:50.000
They've now created an organic robot.

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:52.000
The graduate students

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.000
in Sanjiv Talwar's lab

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.000
said, "Is this ethical?

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:59.000
We've taken away the autonomy of this animal."

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.000
I'll get back to that in a minute.

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:04.000
There's also been work done with monkeys.

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:07.000
This is Miguel Nicolelis of Duke.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:09.000
He took owl monkeys,

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:11.000
wired them up

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:13.000
so that a computer watched their brains while they moved,

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:15.000
especially looking at the movement of their right arm.

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:17.000
The computer learned what the monkey brain did

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:19.000
to move its arm in various ways.

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:22.000
They then hooked it up to a prosthetic arm,

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.000
which you see here in the picture,

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.000
put the arm in another room.

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:29.000
Pretty soon, the computer learned, by reading the monkey's brainwaves,

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:31.000
to make that arm in the other room

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:34.000
do whatever the monkey's arm did.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:36.000
Then he put a video monitor

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.000
in the monkey's cage

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.000
that showed the monkey this prosthetic arm,

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:42.000
and the monkey got fascinated.

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.000
The monkey recognized that whatever she did with her arm,

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:46.000
this prosthetic arm would do.

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:49.000
And eventually she was moving it and moving it,

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:51.000
and eventually stopped moving her right arm

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:53.000
and, staring at the screen,

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:56.000
could move the prosthetic arm in the other room

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:58.000
only with her brainwaves --

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:00.000
which means that monkey

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:03.000
became the first primate in the history of the world

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:06.000
to have three independent functional arms.

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:09.000
And it's not just technology

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:11.000
that we're putting into animals.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:14.000
This is Thomas DeMarse at the University of Florida.

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.000
He took 20,000 and then 60,000

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:19.000
disaggregated rat neurons --

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:22.000
so these are just individual neurons from rats --

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:24.000
put them on a chip.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:27.000
They self-aggregated into a network,

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:30.000
became an integrated chip.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.000
And he used that

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.000
as the IT piece

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:37.000
of a mechanism which ran a flight simulator.

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:40.000
So now we have organic computer chips

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:43.000
made out of living, self-aggregating neurons.

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:48.000
Finally, Mussa-Ivaldi of Northwestern

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:50.000
took a completely intact,

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:53.000
independent lamprey eel brain.

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:55.000
This is a brain from a lamprey eel.

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:57.000
It is living --

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:00.000
fully-intact brain in a nutrient medium

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:03.000
with these electrodes going off to the sides,

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:06.000
attached photosensitive sensors to the brain,

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:08.000
put it into a cart --

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:11.000
here's the cart, the brain is sitting there in the middle --

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:14.000
and using this brain as the sole processor for this cart,

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:16.000
when you turn on a light and shine it at the cart,

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:18.000
the cart moves toward the light;

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.000
when you turn it off, it moves away.

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:22.000
It's photophilic.

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:25.000
So now we have a complete

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:27.000
living lamprey eel brain.

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:29.000
Is it thinking lamprey eel thoughts,

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:31.000
sitting there in its nutrient medium?

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:33.000
I don't know,

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:37.000
but in fact it is a fully living brain

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:40.000
that we have managed to keep alive

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:43.000
to do our bidding.

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:46.000
So, we are now at the stage

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:48.000
where we are creating creatures

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:50.000
for our own purposes.

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:53.000
This is a mouse created by Charles Vacanti

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:56.000
of the University of Massachusetts.

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:59.000
He altered this mouse

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:01.000
so that it was genetically engineered

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:04.000
to have skin that was less immunoreactive to human skin,

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:08.000
put a polymer scaffolding of an ear under it

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:11.000
and created an ear that could then be taken off the mouse

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:13.000
and transplanted onto a human being.

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:15.000
Genetic engineering

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:17.000
coupled with polymer physiotechnology

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:19.000
coupled with xenotransplantation.

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:22.000
This is where we are in this process.

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:25.000
Finally, not that long ago,

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:28.000
Craig Venter created the first artificial cell,

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:30.000
where he took a cell, took a DNA synthesizer,

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:32.000
which is a machine,

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:34.000
created an artificial genome,

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:37.000
put it in a different cell --

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:40.000
the genome was not of the cell he put it in --

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:42.000
and that cell then reproduced

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:44.000
as the other cell.

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:46.000
In other words,

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:48.000
that was the first creature in the history of the world

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:50.000
that had a computer as its parent --

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:53.000
it did not have an organic parent.

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:56.000
And so, asks The Economist:

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:59.000
"The first artificial organism and its consequences."

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:01.000
So you may have thought

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:03.000
that the creation of life

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:06.000
was going to happen in something that looked like that.

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:08.000
(Laughter)

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:11.000
But in fact, that's not what Frankenstein's lab looks like.

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:13.000
This is what Frankenstein's lab looks like.

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:15.000
This is a DNA synthesizer,

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:17.000
and here at the bottom

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:19.000
are just bottles of A, T, C and G --

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:21.000
the four chemicals

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:23.000
that make up our DNA chain.

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:26.000
And so, we need to ask ourselves some questions.

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:29.000
For the first time in the history of this planet,

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:32.000
we are able to directly design organisms.

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:34.000
We can manipulate the plasmas of life

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:37.000
with unprecedented power,

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:39.000
and it confers on us a responsibility.

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:41.000
Is everything okay?

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:43.000
Is it okay to manipulate and create

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:45.000
whatever creatures we want?

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:47.000
Do we have free reign

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:49.000
to design animals?

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:52.000
Do we get to go someday to Pets 'R' Us

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:54.000
and say, "Look, I want a dog.

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:57.000
I'd like it to have the head of a Dachshund,

00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:59.000
the body of a retriever,

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:01.000
maybe some pink fur,

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:03.000
and let's make it glow in the dark"?

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:05.000
Does industry get to create creatures

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:08.000
who, in their milk, in their blood, and in their saliva

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:10.000
and other bodily fluids,

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:13.000
create the drugs and industrial molecules we want

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:15.000
and then warehouse them

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:18.000
as organic manufacturing machines?

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:21.000
Do we get to create organic robots,

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:24.000
where we remove the autonomy from these animals

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:27.000
and turn them just into our playthings?

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:30.000
And then the final step of this,

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:32.000
once we perfect these technologies in animals

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:34.000
and we start using them in human beings,

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:36.000
what are the ethical guidelines

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:39.000
that we will use then?

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:42.000
It's already happening. It's not science fiction.

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:45.000
We are not only already using these things in animals,

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:48.000
some of them we're already beginning to use

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:50.000
on our own bodies.

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:53.000
We are now taking control of our own evolution.

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:55.000
We are directly designing

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:58.000
the future of the species of this planet.

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:01.000
It confers upon us an enormous responsibility

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:03.000
that is not just the responsibility

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:05.000
of the scientists and the ethicists

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:07.000
who are thinking about it and writing about it now.

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:10.000
It is the responsibility of everybody

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:13.000
because it will determine what kind of planet and what kind of bodies

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:15.000
we will have in the future.

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:17.000
Thanks.

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:21.000
(Applause)
