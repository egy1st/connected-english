00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
I want you now to imagine

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
a wearable robot

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
that gives you superhuman abilities,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
or another one that takes wheelchair users

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
up standing and walking again.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
We at Berkeley Bionics

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
call these robots exoskeletons.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
These are nothing else

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
than something that you put on in the morning,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
and it will give you extra strength,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
and it will further enhance your speed,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000
and it will help you, for instance, to manage your balance.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
It is actually the true integration

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
of the man and the machine.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
But not only that --

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
it will integrate and network you

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
to the universe

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
and other devices out there.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
This is just not some blue sky thinking.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
To show you now what we are working on

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
by starting out talking about

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
the American soldier,

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000
that on average does carry about 100 lbs. on their backs,

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
and they are being asked to carry more equipment.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
Obviously, this is resulting

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
in some major complications --

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.000
back injuries, 30 percent of them --

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
chronic back injuries.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
So we thought we would look at this challenge

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
and create an exoskeleton

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.000
that would help deal with this issue.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.000
So let me now introduce to you HULC --

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
or the Human Universal

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
Load Carrier.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
Soldier: With the HULC exoskeleton,

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
I can carry 200 lbs. over varied terrain

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
for many hours.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
Its flexible design allows for deep squats,

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
crawls and high-agility movements.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
It senses what I want to do, where I want to go,

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000
and then augments my strength and endurance.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
Eythor Bender: We are ready with our industry partner

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
to introduce this device,

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
this new exoskeleton this year.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
So this is for real.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
Now let's turn our heads

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
towards the wheelchair users,

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
something that I'm particularly passionate about.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
There are 68 million people

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
estimated to be in wheelchairs worldwide.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
This is about one percent of the total population.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
And that's actually a conservative estimate.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
We are talking here about, oftentimes,

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000
very young individuals with spinal cord injuries,

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000
that in the prime of their life -- 20s, 30s, 40s --

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
hit a wall

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
and the wheelchair's the only option.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
But it is also the aging population

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000
that is multiplying in numbers.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000
And the only option, pretty much --

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
when it's stroke or other complications --

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
is the wheelchair.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.000
And that is actually for the last 500 years,

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
since its very successful introduction, I must say.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
So we thought we would start

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
writing a brand new chapter

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000
of mobility.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000
Let me now introduce you to eLEGS

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.000
that is worn by Amanda Boxtel

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.000
that 19 years ago was spinal cord injured,

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000
and as a result of that

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
she has not been able to walk

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
for 19 years until now.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000
(Applause)

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000
Amanda Boxtel: Thank you.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000
(Applause)

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.000
EB: Amanda is wearing our eLEGS set.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000
It has sensors.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000
It's completely non-invasive,

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000
sensors in the crutches

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000
that send signals back to our onboard computer

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
that is sitting here at her back.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
There are battery packs here as well

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.000
that power motors that are sitting at her hips,

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000
as well as her knee joints,

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000
that move her forward

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.000
in this kind of smooth and very natural gait.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000
AB: I was 24 years old

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000
and at the top of my game

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.000
when a freak summersault while downhill skiing

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000
paralyzed me.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000
In a split second,

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000
I lost all sensation and movement

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000
below my pelvis.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
Not long afterwards,

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.000
a doctor strode into my hospital room,

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000
and he said, "Amanda,

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:41.000
you'll never walk again."

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.000
And that was 19 yeas ago.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000
He robbed

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000
every ounce of hope

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000
from my being.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
Adaptive technology

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000
has since enabled me

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000
to learn how to downhill ski again,

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.000
to rock climb and even handcycle.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:03.000
But nothing has been invented

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000
that enables me to walk,

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000
until now.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.000
(Applause)

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000
Thank you.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:20.000
(Applause)

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000
EB: As you can see,

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000
we have the technology,

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000
we have the platforms

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.000
to sit down and have discussions with you.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000
It's in our hands,

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:35.000
and we have all the potential here

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000
to change the lives

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000
of future generations --

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:43.000
not only for the soldiers,

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:47.000
or for Amanda here and all the wheelchair users,

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.000
but for everyone.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000
AB: Thanks.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:06:02.000
(Applause)
