00:02:11.519 --> 00:02:14.527
Pep Rosenfeld: Folks,
you've just met Claron McFadden.

00:02:14.551 --> 00:02:17.138
She is a world-class soprano singer

00:02:17.162 --> 00:02:18.976
who studied in Rochester, New York.

00:02:19.678 --> 00:02:22.975
Her celebrated operatic roles
are numerous and varied.

00:02:23.389 --> 00:02:28.960
In August 2007, Claron was awarded
the Amsterdam Prize for the Arts,

00:02:28.984 --> 00:02:30.799
winning praise for her brilliance,

00:02:30.823 --> 00:02:34.229
her amazing and extensively
wide repertoire

00:02:34.253 --> 00:02:35.976
and her vivid stage personality.

00:02:36.444 --> 00:02:38.390
Please welcome Claron McFadden.

00:02:38.414 --> 00:02:45.334
(Applause)

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:51.067
Claron McFadden: The human voice:

00:02:52.074 --> 00:02:55.847
mysterious, spontaneous, primal.

00:02:57.793 --> 00:03:02.730
For me, the human voice is the vessel
on which all emotions travel --

00:03:02.754 --> 00:03:04.667
except, perhaps, jealousy.

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:08.055
And the breath,

00:03:08.079 --> 00:03:10.235
the breath is the captain of that vessel.

00:03:12.331 --> 00:03:13.893
A child is born,

00:03:15.298 --> 00:03:16.941
takes its first breath --

00:03:17.603 --> 00:03:21.516
(Inhales)

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:23.900
Whah!

00:03:25.271 --> 00:03:28.337
And we behold the wondrous beauty

00:03:29.694 --> 00:03:31.178
of vocal expression --

00:03:31.928 --> 00:03:34.551
mysterious, spontaneous

00:03:35.639 --> 00:03:36.790
and primal.

00:03:38.663 --> 00:03:41.805
A few years ago, I did
a meditation retreat in Thailand.

00:03:41.829 --> 00:03:43.282
I wanted a place

00:03:44.019 --> 00:03:47.976
where I would have total silence
and total solitude.

00:03:48.728 --> 00:03:51.335
I spent two weeks at this retreat

00:03:51.359 --> 00:03:53.073
in my own little hut --

00:03:53.097 --> 00:03:55.906
no music, no nothing -- sounds of nature,

00:03:56.954 --> 00:04:00.493
trying to find the essence
of concentration,

00:04:00.517 --> 00:04:01.975
being in the moment.

00:04:02.677 --> 00:04:04.534
On my last day,

00:04:04.558 --> 00:04:06.677
the woman who looked after the place,

00:04:07.415 --> 00:04:09.591
she came and we spoke for a minute,

00:04:09.615 --> 00:04:11.083
and then she said to me,

00:04:12.321 --> 00:04:13.976
"Would you sing something for me?"

00:04:14.655 --> 00:04:17.932
And I thought, but this is a place
of total quiet and silence.

00:04:17.956 --> 00:04:19.487
I can't make noise.

00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:23.000
She said, "Please, sing for me."

00:04:24.293 --> 00:04:25.976
So I closed my eyes,

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:28.197
I took breath

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:32.340
and the first thing that came up and out

00:04:33.205 --> 00:04:34.602
was "Summertime,"

00:04:35.777 --> 00:04:36.975
Porgy and Bess.

00:04:36.999 --> 00:04:41.142
(Singing) Summertime
and the livin' is easy.

00:04:42.372 --> 00:04:45.514
Fish are jumpin' and the cotton is high.

00:04:45.538 --> 00:04:49.523
Oh, your daddy's rich
and your ma is good-lookin'.

00:04:49.547 --> 00:04:51.137
So hush little baby,

00:04:51.161 --> 00:04:53.586
don't you cry.

00:04:54.843 --> 00:04:56.554
And I opened my eyes,

00:04:57.213 --> 00:04:59.976
and I saw that she had her eyes closed.

00:05:00.741 --> 00:05:02.844
And after a moment, she opened her eyes

00:05:02.868 --> 00:05:04.526
and she looked at me and she said,

00:05:05.765 --> 00:05:07.402
"It's like meditation."

00:05:08.505 --> 00:05:10.727
And in that moment I understood

00:05:10.751 --> 00:05:14.163
that everything I had gone
to Thailand to look for,

00:05:14.187 --> 00:05:15.773
to search for,

00:05:15.797 --> 00:05:18.192
I had it already in my singing --

00:05:19.606 --> 00:05:22.559
the calm, but alertness,

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:25.893
the focus, but awareness,

00:05:26.544 --> 00:05:29.353
and being totally in the moment.

00:05:31.035 --> 00:05:32.781
When you're totally in the moment --

00:05:32.805 --> 00:05:34.304
when I'm totally in the moment,

00:05:34.328 --> 00:05:36.533
the vessel of expression is open.

00:05:36.557 --> 00:05:39.129
The emotions can flow from me

00:05:39.153 --> 00:05:40.326
to you

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:41.546
and back.

00:05:42.557 --> 00:05:44.446
It's an extremely profound experience.

00:05:46.787 --> 00:05:49.137
There's a piece by a composer,

00:05:49.161 --> 00:05:51.759
an American composer called John Cage.

00:05:51.783 --> 00:05:53.363
It's called "Aria."

00:05:53.387 --> 00:05:57.976
It was written for an amazing singer
called Cathy Berberian.

00:05:58.492 --> 00:06:00.976
And the thing about this piece
that's so special --

00:06:01.682 --> 00:06:02.976
if you see it behind me --

00:06:04.007 --> 00:06:06.181
it's not notated in any way.

00:06:07.409 --> 00:06:10.100
No notes, no flats, no sharps.

00:06:10.798 --> 00:06:12.544
But it's a kind of structure.

00:06:13.171 --> 00:06:15.631
And the singer, within this structure,

00:06:15.655 --> 00:06:19.675
has total freedom
to be creative, spontaneous.

00:06:20.278 --> 00:06:21.429
For example,

00:06:22.572 --> 00:06:24.119
there are different colors

00:06:24.143 --> 00:06:28.095
and each color gets
a different type of singing --

00:06:28.119 --> 00:06:32.008
pop, country and western, opera, jazz --

00:06:32.032 --> 00:06:35.159
and you just have
to be consistent with that color.

00:06:36.350 --> 00:06:38.199
You see there are different lines.

00:06:38.738 --> 00:06:40.945
You choose in your own tempo
in your own way

00:06:40.969 --> 00:06:42.222
to follow the line,

00:06:42.246 --> 00:06:43.654
but you must respect it,

00:06:44.466 --> 00:06:45.623
more or less.

00:06:46.131 --> 00:06:47.615
And these little dots,

00:06:48.646 --> 00:06:52.064
these represent a sort of sound

00:06:53.199 --> 00:06:55.976
that's not a vocal, not a lyrical way

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.207
of expressing the voice.

00:06:58.231 --> 00:07:00.292
Using the body -- it could be sneezing,

00:07:00.316 --> 00:07:01.895
it could be coughing, animals --

00:07:01.919 --> 00:07:03.514
(Audience member coughs)

00:07:03.538 --> 00:07:04.830
Exactly. (Laughter)

00:07:04.854 --> 00:07:06.507
Clapping, whatever.

00:07:07.878 --> 00:07:09.845
And there's different text.

00:07:09.869 --> 00:07:13.604
There's Armenian, Russian,
French, English, Italian.

00:07:14.199 --> 00:07:16.707
So within this structure, one is free.

00:07:17.685 --> 00:07:20.288
To me, this piece is an ode to the voice,

00:07:21.732 --> 00:07:24.280
because it's mysterious, as we can see.

00:07:26.153 --> 00:07:27.795
It's quite spontaneous.

00:07:30.551 --> 00:07:31.894
And it's primal.

00:07:32.505 --> 00:07:34.695
So I would like to share
this piece with you,

00:07:34.719 --> 00:07:36.669
It's "Aria," of John Cage.

00:07:44.268 --> 00:07:45.721

00:07:45.745 --> 00:07:50.197
