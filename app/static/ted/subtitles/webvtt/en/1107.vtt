00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
The idea behind the Stuxnet computer worm

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
is actually quite simple.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
We don't want Iran to get the bomb.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Their major asset for developing nuclear weapons

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
is the Natanz uranium enrichment facility.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
The gray boxes that you see,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
these are real-time control systems.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Now if we manage to compromise these systems

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
that control drive speeds and valves,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
we can actually cause a lot of problems

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
with the centrifuge.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
The gray boxes don't run Windows software;

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
they are a completely different technology.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
But if we manage

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
to place a good Windows virus

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
on a notebook

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
that is used by a maintenance engineer

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
to configure this gray box,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
then we are in business.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
And this is the plot behind Stuxnet.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.000
So we start with a Windows dropper.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
The payload goes onto the gray box,

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
damages the centrifuge,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
and the Iranian nuclear program is delayed --

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
mission accomplished.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
That's easy, huh?

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
I want to tell you how we found that out.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
When we started our research on Stuxnet six months ago,

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
it was completely unknown what the purpose of this thing was.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
The only thing that was known

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
is it's very, very complex on the Windows part, the dropper part,

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
used multiple zero-day vulnerabilities.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
And it seemed to want to do something

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
with these gray boxes, these real-time control systems.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
So that got our attention,

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
and we started a lab project

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.000
where we infected our environment with Stuxnet

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
and checked this thing out.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
And then some very funny things happened.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
Stuxnet behaved like a lab rat

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
that didn't like our cheese --

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
sniffed, but didn't want to eat.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
Didn't make sense to me.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
And after we experimented with different flavors of cheese,

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.000
I realized, well, this is a directed attack.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
It's completely directed.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
The dropper is prowling actively

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
on the gray box

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
if a specific configuration is found,

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.000
and even if the actual program code that it's trying to infect

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
is actually running on that target.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000
And if not, Stuxnet does nothing.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
So that really got my attention,

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
and we started to work on this

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
nearly around the clock,

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000
because I thought, "Well, we don't know what the target is.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
It could be, let's say for example,

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
a U.S. power plant,

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
or a chemical plant in Germany.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000
So we better find out what the target is soon."

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
So we extracted and decompiled

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
the attack code,

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000
and we discovered that it's structured in two digital bombs --

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000
a smaller one and a bigger one.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.000
And we also saw that they are very professionally engineered

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.000
by people who obviously had all insider information.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
They knew all the bits and bites

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
that they had to attack.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000
They probably even know the shoe size of the operator.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
So they know everything.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000
And if you have heard that the dropper of Stuxnet

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
is complex and high-tech,

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
let me tell you this:

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000
the payload is rocket science.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
It's way above everything

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000
that we have ever seen before.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000
Here you see a sample of this actual attack code.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000
We are talking about --

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.000
around about 15,000 lines of code.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.000
Looks pretty much like old-style assembly language.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
And I want to tell you how we were able

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000
to make sense out of this code.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000
So what we were looking for is, first of all, system function calls,

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000
because we know what they do.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.000
And then we were looking for timers and data structures

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000
and trying to relate them to the real world --

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000
to potential real world targets.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.000
So we do need target theories

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.000
that we can prove or disprove.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000
In order to get target theories,

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000
we remember

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000
that it's definitely hardcore sabotage,

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000
it must be a high-value target

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000
and it is most likely located in Iran,

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.000
because that's where most of the infections had been reported.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.000
Now you don't find several thousand targets in that area.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000
It basically boils down

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000
to the Bushehr nuclear power plant

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000
and to the Natanz fuel enrichment plant.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000
So I told my assistant,

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.000
"Get me a list of all centrifuge and power plant experts from our client base."

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000
And I phoned them up and picked their brain

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.000
in an effort to match their expertise

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.000
with what we found in code and data.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
And that worked pretty well.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
So we were able to associate

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000
the small digital warhead

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000
with the rotor control.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.000
The rotor is that moving part within the centrifuge,

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000
that black object that you see.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.000
And if you manipulate the speed of this rotor,

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000
you are actually able to crack the rotor

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:50.000
and eventually even have the centrifuge explode.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
What we also saw

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000
is that the goal of the attack

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000
was really to do it slowly and creepy --

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000
obviously in an effort

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.000
to drive maintenance engineers crazy,

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.000
that they would not be able to figure this out quickly.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.000
The big digital warhead -- we had a shot at this

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000
by looking very closely

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000
at data and data structures.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000
So for example, the number 164

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000
really stands out in that code;

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000
you can't overlook it.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000
I started to research scientific literature

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000
on how these centrifuges

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000
are actually built in Natanz

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000
and found they are structured

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000
in what is called a cascade,

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:32.000
and each cascade holds 164 centrifuges.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.000
So that made sense, that was a match.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000
And it even got better.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.000
These centrifuges in Iran

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:42.000
are subdivided into 15, what is called, stages.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.000
And guess what we found in the attack code?

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000
An almost identical structure.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.000
So again, that was a real good match.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.000
And this gave us very high confidence for what we were looking at.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.000
Now don't get me wrong here, it didn't go like this.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.000
These results have been obtained

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.000
over several weeks of really hard labor.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.000
And we often went into just a dead end

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.000
and had to recover.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000
Anyway, so we figured out

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000
that both digital warheads

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000
were actually aiming at one and the same target,

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000
but from different angles.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.000
The small warhead is taking one cascade,

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.000
and spinning up the rotors and slowing them down,

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000
and the big warhead

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000
is talking to six cascades

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000
and manipulating valves.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000
So in all, we are very confident

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000
that we have actually determined what the target is.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.000
It is Natanz, and it is only Natanz.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.000
So we don't have to worry

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.000
that other targets

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000
might be hit by Stuxnet.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.000
Here's some very cool stuff that we saw --

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000
really knocked my socks off.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.000
Down there is the gray box,

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:49.000
and on the top you see the centrifuges.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000
Now what this thing does

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.000
is it intercepts the input values from sensors --

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000
so for example, from pressure sensors

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.000
and vibration sensors --

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:01.000
and it provides legitimate program code,

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.000
which is still running during the attack,

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.000
with fake input data.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.000
And as a matter of fact, this fake input data

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:10.000
is actually prerecorded by Stuxnet.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.000
So it's just like from the Hollywood movies

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.000
where during the heist,

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.000
the observation camera is fed with prerecorded video.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.000
That's cool, huh?

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.000
The idea here is obviously

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:25.000
not only to fool the operators in the control room.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:29.000
It actually is much more dangerous and aggressive.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000
The idea

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:34.000
is to circumvent a digital safety system.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.000
We need digital safety systems

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:40.000
where a human operator could not act quick enough.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.000
So for example, in a power plant,

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:45.000
when your big steam turbine gets too over speed,

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.000
you must open relief valves within a millisecond.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:51.000
Obviously, this cannot be done by a human operator.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.000
So this is where we need digital safety systems.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.000
And when they are compromised,

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:58.000
then real bad things can happen.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000
Your plant can blow up.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.000
And neither your operators nor your safety system will notice it.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.000
That's scary.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.000
But it gets worse.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:10.000
And this is very important, what I'm going to say.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000
Think about this:

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.000
this attack is generic.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:19.000
It doesn't have anything to do, in specifics,

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.000
with centrifuges,

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:24.000
with uranium enrichment.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.000
So it would work as well, for example,

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.000
in a power plant

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:32.000
or in an automobile factory.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.000
It is generic.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.000
And you don't have -- as an attacker --

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.000
you don't have to deliver this payload

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.000
by a USB stick,

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.000
as we saw it in the case of Stuxnet.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:46.000
You could also use conventional worm technology for spreading.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:49.000
Just spread it as wide as possible.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000
And if you do that,

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.000
what you end up with

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:58.000
is a cyber weapon of mass destruction.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.000
That's the consequence

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:04.000
that we have to face.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:07.000
So unfortunately,

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:10.000
the biggest number of targets for such attacks

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.000
are not in the Middle East.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.000
They're in the United States and Europe and in Japan.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.000
So all of the green areas,

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:20.000
these are your target-rich environments.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:23.000
We have to face the consequences,

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:26.000
and we better start to prepare right now.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.000
Thanks.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:34.000
(Applause)

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.000
Chris Anderson: I've got a question.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.000
Ralph, it's been quite widely reported

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.000
that people assume that Mossad

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:44.000
is the main entity behind this.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:47.000
Is that your opinion?

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.000
Ralph Langner: Okay, you really want to hear that?

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.000
Yeah. Okay.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:54.000
My opinion is that the Mossad is involved,

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:57.000
but that the leading force is not Israel.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.000
So the leading force behind that

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:02.000
is the cyber superpower.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.000
There is only one,

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.000
and that's the United States --

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.000
fortunately, fortunately.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.000
Because otherwise,

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:13.000
our problems would even be bigger.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:17.000
CA: Thank you for scaring the living daylights out of us. Thank you, Ralph.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.000
(Applause)
