WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Adrian Kohler: Well, we're here today

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
to talk about the evolution of a puppet horse.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Basil Jones: But actually we're going to start this evolution

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
with a hyena.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
AK: The ancestor of the horse.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Okay, we'll do something with it.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
(Laughter)

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:57.000
Hahahaha.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
The hyena is the ancestor of the horse

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
because it was part of a production

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
called "Faustus in Africa,"

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
a Handspring Production from 1995,

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
where it had to play draughts with Helen of Troy.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
This production was directed

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
by South African artist and theater director,

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
William Kentridge.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
So it needed a very articulate front paw.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
But, like all puppets, it has other attributes.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
BJ: One of them is breath,

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
and it kind of breathes.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.000
AK: Haa haa haaa.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000
BJ: Breath is really important for us.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
It's the kind of original movement

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
for any puppet for us onstage.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
It's the thing that distinguishes the puppet --

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
AK: Oops.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
BJ: From an actor.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
Puppets always have to try to be alive.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.000
It's their kind of ur-story onstage,

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
that desperation to live.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000
AK: Yeah, it's basically a dead object, as you can see,

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
and it only lives

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
because you make it.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
An actor struggles to die onstage,

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
but a puppet has to struggle to live.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
And in a way that's a metaphor for life.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
BJ: So every moment it's on the stage, it's making the struggle.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
So we call this

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.000
a piece of emotional engineering

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
that uses up-to-the-minute

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
17th century technology --

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
(Laughter)

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
to turn nouns

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
into verbs.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
AK: Well actually I prefer to say

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
that it's an object

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
constructed out of wood and cloth

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
with movement built into it

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000
to persuade you to believe that it has life.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
BJ: Okay so.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
AK: It has ears that move passively

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
when the head goes.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000
BJ: And it has these bulkheads

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
made out of plywood,

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
covered with fabric --

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000
curiously similar, in fact,

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
to the plywood canoes

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
that Adrian's father used to make

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000
when he was a boy in their workshop.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.000
AK: In Port Elizabeth, the village outside Port Elizabeth in South Africa.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000
BJ: His mother was a puppeteer.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
And when we met at art school

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000
and fell in love

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
in 1971,

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000
I hated puppets.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000
I really thought they were so beneath me.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000
I wanted to become an avant-garde artist --

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000
and Punch and Judy was certainly not where I wanted to go.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000
And, in fact, it took about 10 years

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000
to discover

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.000
the Bambara Bamana puppets of Mali in West Africa,

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.000
where there's a fabulous tradition of puppetry,

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.000
to learn a renewed, or a new, respect

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000
for this art form.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000
AK: So in 1981, I persuaded Basil and some friends of mine

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000
to form a puppet company.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.000
And 20 years later, miraculously,

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000
we collaborated with a company from Mali,

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.000
the Sogolon Marionette Troupe of Bamako,

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000
where we made a piece about a tall giraffe.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000
It was just called "Tall Horse," which was a life-sized giraffe.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000
BJ: And here again, you see the same structure.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:25.000
The bulkheads have now turned into hoops of cane,

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000
but it's ultimately the same structure.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000
It's got two people inside it on stilts,

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000
which give them the height,

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000
and somebody in the front

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000
who's using a kind of steering wheel to move that head.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000
AK: The person in the hind legs

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.000
is also controlling the tail, a bit like the hyena --

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.000
same mechanism, just a bit bigger.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.000
And he's controlling the ear movement.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000
BJ: So this production

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
was seen by Tom Morris

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000
of the National Theatre in London.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000
And just around that time,

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000
his mother had said,

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.000
"Have you seen this book by Michael Morpurgo

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000
called 'War Horse'?"

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000
AK: It's about a boy who falls in love with a horse.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000
The horse is sold to the First World War,

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000
and he joins up to find his horse.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000
BJ: So Tom gave us a call and said,

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.000
"Do you think you could make us a horse

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000
for a show to happen at the National Theatre?"

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000
AK: It seemed a lovely idea.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000
BJ: But it had to ride. It had to have a rider.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000
AK: It had to have a rider,

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.000
and it had to participate in cavalry charges.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.000
(Laughter)

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000
A play about early 20th century plowing technology

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.000
and cavalry charges

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.000
was a little bit of a challenge for the accounting department

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000
at the National Theatre in London.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000
But they agreed to go along with it for a while.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000
So we began with a test.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.000
BJ: This is Adrian and Thys Stander,

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.000
who went on to actually design the cane system for the horse,

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000
and our next-door neighbor Katherine,

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000
riding on a ladder.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.000
The weight is really difficult when it's up above your head.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000
AK: And once we put Katherine

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.000
through that particular brand of hell,

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.000
we knew that we might be able to make a horse, which could be ridden.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.000
So we made a model.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.000
This is a cardboard model,

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000
a little bit smaller than the hyena.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000
You'll notice that the legs are plywood legs

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000
and the canoe structure is still there.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000
BJ: And the two manipulators are inside.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.000
But we didn't realize at the time

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.000
that we actually needed a third manipulator,

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.000
because we couldn't manipulate the neck

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.000
from inside

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.000
and walk the horse at the same time.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000
AK: We started work on the prototype

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000
after the model was approved,

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000
and the prototype took a bit longer

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000
than we anticipated.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.000
We had to throw out the plywood legs and make new cane ones.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000
And we had a crate built for it.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.000
It had to be shipped to London.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.000
We were going to test-drive it on the street outside of our house in Cape Town,

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.000
and it got to midnight and we hadn't done that yet.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000
BJ: So we got a camera,

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:52.000
and we posed the puppet

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:57.000
in various galloping stances.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.000
And we sent it off

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000
to the National Theatre,

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000
hoping that they believed

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.000
that we created something that worked.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.000
(Laughter)

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.000
AK: A month later, we were there in London

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:14.000
with this big box and a studio full of people about to work with us.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.000
BJ: About 40 people.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.000
AK: We were terrified.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.000
We opened the lid, we took the horse out,

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:23.000
and it did work; it walked and it was able to be ridden.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.000
Here I have an 18-second clip

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:28.000
of the very first walk of the prototype.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000
This is in the National Theatre studio,

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000
the place where they cook new ideas.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.000
It had by no means got the green light yet.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.000
The choreographer, Toby Sedgwick,

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.000
invented a beautiful sequence

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.000
where the baby horse,

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:51.000
which was made out of sticks and bits of twigs,

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.000
grew up into the big horse.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:56.000
And Nick Starr, the director of the National Theatre,

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:59.000
saw that particular moment, he was standing next to me -- he nearly wet himself.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:02.000
And so the show was given the green light.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:05.000
And we went back to Cape Town and redesigned the horse completely.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.000
Here is the plan.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.000
(Laughter)

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.000
And here is our factory in Cape Town

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:16.000
where we make horses.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:19.000
You can see quite a lot of skeletons in the background there.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:23.000
The horses are completely handmade.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:26.000
There is very little 20th century technology in them.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000
We used a bit of laser cutting on the plywood

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.000
and some of the aluminum pieces.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000
But because they have to be light and flexible,

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:35.000
and each one of them is different,

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:38.000
they can't be mass-produced, unfortunately.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:41.000
So here are some half-finished horses

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:44.000
ready to be worked in London.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000
And now we would like to introduce you

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.000
to Joey.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:52.000
Joey boy, you there?

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.000
Joey.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:58.000
(Applause)

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:23.000
(Applause)

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.000
Joey.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.000
Joey, come here.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.000
No, no, I haven't got it.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:00.000
He's got it; it's in his pocket.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.000
BJ: Joey.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:18.000
AK: Joey, Joey, Joey, Joey.

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:21.000
Come here. Stand here where people can see you.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.000
Move around. Come on.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.000
I'd just like to describe --

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:38.000
I won't talk too loud. He might get irritated.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:43.000
Here, Craig is working the head.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.000
He has bicycle brake cables

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:48.000
going down to the head control in his hand.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.000
Each one of them

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:53.000
operates either an ear, separately,

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.000
or the head, up and down.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:58.000
But he also controls the head directly

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.000
by using his hand.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.000
The ears are obviously

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:05.000
a very important emotional indicator of the horse.

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:09.000
When they point right back,

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:13.000
the horse is fearful or angry,

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:16.000
depending upon what's going on in front of him, around him.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.000
Or, when he's more relaxed, the head comes down

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:21.000
and the ears listen, either side.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.000
Horses' hearing is very important.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:28.000
It's almost more important than their eyesight.

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.000
Over here,

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:34.000
Tommy's got what you call the heart position.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.000
He's working the leg.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:39.000
You see the string tendon from the hyena,

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:42.000
the hyena's front leg,

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:45.000
automatically pulls the hoop up.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:50.000
(Laughter)

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.000
Horses are so unpredictable.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:56.000
(Laughter)

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:59.000
The way a hoof comes up with a horse

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.000
immediately gives you the feeling

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.000
that it's a convincing horse action.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:06.000
The hind legs have got the same action.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:11.000
BJ: And Mikey also has,

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.000
in his fingers,

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:15.000
the ability to move the tail

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:17.000
from left to right,

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:19.000
and up and down with the other hand.

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:22.000
And together, there's quite a complex possibility

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:24.000
of tail expression.

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:26.000
AK: You want to say something about the breathing?

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:29.000
BJ: We had a big challenge with breathing.

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:31.000
Adrian thought

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:33.000
that he was going to have to split the chest of the puppet in two

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:35.000
and make it breathe like that --

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:38.000
because that's how a horse would breathe, with an expanded chest.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.000
But we realized

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:42.000
that, if that were to be happening,

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:44.000
you wouldn't, as an audience, see the breath.

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:48.000
So he made a channel in here,

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:51.000
and the chest moves up and down in that channel.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.000
So it's anti-naturalistic really, the up and down movement,

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.000
but it feels like breath.

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.000
And it's very, very simple

00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:59.000
because all that happens

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:02.000
is that the puppeteer breathes with his knees.

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:07.000
AK: Other emotional stuff.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:09.000
If I were to touch the horse here

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:12.000
on his skin,

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:15.000
the heart puppeteer can shake the body from inside

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:17.000
and get the skin to quiver.

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:19.000
You'll notice, of course,

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:21.000
that the puppet is made out of cane lines.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:24.000
And I would like you to believe that it was an aesthetic choice,

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.000
that I was making a three-dimensional drawing of a horse

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:28.000
that somehow moves in space.

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.000
But of course, it was the cane is light,

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.000
the cane is flexible, the cane is durable

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.000
and the cane is moldable.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:37.000
And so it was a very practical reason why it was made of cane.

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:39.000
The skin itself

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:41.000
is made out of a see-through nylon mesh,

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:43.000
which, if the lighting designer

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:45.000
wants the horse to almost disappear,

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.000
she can light the background

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:50.000
and the horse becomes ghostlike.

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.000
You see the skeletal structure of it.

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:55.000
Or if you light it from above, it becomes more solid.

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:58.000
Again, that was a practical consideration.

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:01.000
The guys inside the horse have to be able to see out.

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:03.000
They have to be able to act

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:06.000
along with their fellow actors in the production.

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:09.000
And it's very much an in-the-moment activity that they're engaged in.

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:12.000
It's three heads making one character.

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:15.000
But now we would like you to put Joey through some paces.

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:55.000
And plant.

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:02.000
(Whinny)

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:12.000
Thank you.

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:14.000
And now just --

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:22.000
(Applause)

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:24.000
All the way from sunny California

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:26.000
we have Zem Joaquin

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:28.000
who's going to ride the horse for us.

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:32.000
(Applause)

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:33.000
(Applause)

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:39.000
(Music)

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:56.000
So we would like to stress

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:58.000
that the performance you see in the horse

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:00.000
is three guys

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:03.000
who have studied horse behavior incredibly thoroughly.

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:05.000
BJ: Not being able to talk to one another

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:07.000
while they're onstage

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:09.000
because they're mic'd.

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:12.000
The sound that that very large chest makes, of the horse --

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:15.000
the whinnying and the nickering and everything --

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:18.000
that starts usually with one performer,

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:20.000
carries on with a second person

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:22.000
and ends with a third.

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:25.000
AK: Mikey Brett from Leicestershire.

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:32.000
(Applause)

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:35.000
Mikey Brett, Craig, Leo,

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:38.000
Zem Joaquin and Basil and me.

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:41.000
(Applause)

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:43.000
Thank you. Thank you.

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:50.000
(Applause)
