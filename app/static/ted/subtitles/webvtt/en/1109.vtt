00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
As a boy,

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
I loved cars.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
When I turned 18,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
I lost my best friend to a car accident.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Like this.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
And then I decided I'd dedicate my life

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
to saving one million people

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
every year.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Now I haven't succeeded, so this is just a progress report,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
but I'm here to tell you a little bit about self-driving cars.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
I saw the concept first

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
in the DARPA Grand Challenges

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
where the U.S. government issued a prize

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
to build a self-driving car that could navigate a desert.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
And even though a hundred teams were there,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
these cars went nowhere.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
So we decided at Stanford to build a different self-driving car.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
We built the hardware and the software.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
We made it learn from us,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
and we set it free in the desert.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
And the unimaginable happened:

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
it became the first car

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
to ever return from a DARPA Grand Challenge,

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
winning Stanford 2 million dollars.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
Yet I still hadn't saved a single life.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
Since, our work has focused

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
on building driving cars

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
that can drive anywhere by themselves --

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
any street in California.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
We've driven 140,000 miles.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
Our cars have sensors

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
by which they magically can see

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
everything around them

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
and make decisions

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
about every aspect of driving.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
It's the perfect driving mechanism.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
We've driven in cities,

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
like in San Francisco here.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.000
We've driven from San Francisco to Los Angeles on Highway 1.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
We've encountered joggers,

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
busy highways, toll booths,

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
and this is without a person in the loop;

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
the car just drives itself.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
In fact, while we drove 140,000 miles,

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
people didn't even notice.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
Mountain roads,

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
day and night,

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
and even crooked Lombard Street

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
in San Francisco.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
(Laughter)

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
Sometimes our cars get so crazy,

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000
they even do little stunts.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
(Video) Man: Oh, my God.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
What?

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
Second Man: It's driving itself.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
Sebastian Thrun: Now I can't get my friend Harold back to life,

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
but I can do something for all the people who died.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000
Do you know that driving accidents

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000
are the number one cause of death for young people?

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000
And do you realize that almost all of those

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000
are due to human error

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
and not machine error,

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000
and can therefore be prevented by machines?

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000
Do you realize

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.000
that we could change the capacity of highways

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000
by a factor of two or three

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
if we didn't rely on human precision

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
on staying in the lane --

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
improve body position

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
and therefore drive a little bit closer together

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
on a little bit narrower lanes,

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000
and do away with all traffic jams on highways?

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000
Do you realize that you, TED users,

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000
spend an average

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000
of 52 minutes per day

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000
in traffic,

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
wasting your time

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000
on your daily commute?

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000
You could regain this time.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
This is four billion hours

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.000
wasted in this country alone.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.000
And it's 2.4 billion gallons of gasoline wasted.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.000
Now I think there's a vision here, a new technology,

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000
and I'm really looking forward to a time

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000
when generations after us look back at us

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000
and say how ridiculous it was that humans were driving cars.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000
Thank you.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000
(Applause)
