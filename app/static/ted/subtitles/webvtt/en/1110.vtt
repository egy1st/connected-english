00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
I wanted to be a rock star.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
I dreamed of it, and that's all I dreamed of.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
To be more accurate, I wanted to be a pop star.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
This was in the late '80s.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
And mostly I wanted to be the fifth member

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
of Depeche Mode or Duran Duran.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
They wouldn't have me.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
I didn't read music, but I played synthesizers and drum machines.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
And I grew up in this little farming town in northern Nevada.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
And I was certain that's what my life would be.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
And when I went to college at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
when I was 18,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
I was stunned to find

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
that there was not a Pop Star 101,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
or even a degree program for that interest.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
And the choir conductor there

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
knew that I sang

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
and invited me to come and join the choir.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
And I said, "Yes, I would love to do that. It sounds great."

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
And I left the room and said, "No way."

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
The choir people in my high school were pretty geeky,

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
and there was no way I was going to have anything to do with those people.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
And about a week later, a friend of mine came to me and said,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
"Listen, you've got to join choir.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
At the end of the semester, we're taking a trip to Mexico,

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
all expenses paid.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
And the soprano section is just full of hot girls."

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
And so I figured for Mexico and babes,

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
I could do just about anything.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
And I went to my first day in choir,

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
and I sat down with the basses

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
and sort of looked over my shoulder

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
to see what they were doing.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
They opened their scores, the conductor gave the downbeat,

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
and boom, they launched into the Kyrie

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
from the "Requiem" by Mozart.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
In my entire life I had seen in black and white,

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.000
and suddenly everything was in shocking Technicolor.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
The most transformative experience I've ever had --

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
in that single moment, hearing dissonance and harmony

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
and people singing, people together,

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
the shared vision.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
And I felt for the first time in my life

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
that I was part of something bigger than myself.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000
And there were a lot of cute girls in the soprano section, as it turns out.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
I decided to write a piece for choir

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
a couple of years later

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
as a gift to this conductor

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
who had changed my life.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
I had learned to read music by then, or slowly learning to read music.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
And that piece was published,

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
and then I wrote another piece, and that got published.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
And then I started conducting,

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
and I ended up doing my master's degree at the Juilliard School.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
And I find myself now in the unlikely position

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
of standing in front of all of you

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000
as a professional classical composer and conductor.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
Well a couple of years ago,

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
a friend of mine emailed me

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
a link, a YouTube link,

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
and said, "You have got to see this."

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000
And it was this young woman who had posted a fan video to me,

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
singing the soprano line

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
to a piece of mine called "Sleep."

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000
(Video) Britlin Losee: Hi Mr. Eric Whitacre.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000
My name is Britlin Losee,

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
and this is a video

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
that I'd like to make for you.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000
Here's me singing "Sleep."

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000
I'm a little nervous, just to let you know.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:04.000
♫ If there are noises ♫

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:10.000
♫ in the night ♫

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000
Eric Whitacre: I was thunderstruck.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000
Britlin was so innocent and so sweet,

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
and her voice was so pure.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
And I even loved seeing behind her;

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000
I could see the little teddy bear sitting on the piano behind her in her room.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
Such an intimate video.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
And I had this idea: if I could get 50 people

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
to all do this same thing,

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
sing their parts -- soprano, alto, tenor and bass --

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000
wherever they were in the world, post their videos to YouTube,

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000
we could cut it all together and create a virtual choir.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000
So I wrote on my blog, "OMG OMG."

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000
I actually wrote, "OMG,"

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.000
hopefully for the last time in public ever.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000
(Laughter)

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000
And I sent out this call to singers.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.000
And I made free the download of the music

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000
to a piece that I had written in the year 2000

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.000
called "Lux Aurumque," which means "light and gold."

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.000
And lo and behold, people started uploading their videos.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
Now I should say, before that,

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000
what I did is I posted a conductor track

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000
of myself conducting.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.000
And it's in complete silence when I filmed it,

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000
because I was only hearing the music in my head,

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.000
imagining the choir that would one day come to be.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000
Afterwards, I played a piano track underneath

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000
so that the singers would have something to listen to.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.000
And then as the videos started to come in ...

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:27.000
(Singing)

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000
This is Cheryl Ang from Singapore.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:36.000
(Singing)

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000
This is Evangelina Etienne

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:45.000
(Singing)

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000
from Massachusetts.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000
(Singing)

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
Stephen Hanson from Sweden.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000
(Singing)

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000
This is Jamal Walker from Dallas, Texas.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:05.000
(Singing)

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000
There was even a little soprano solo in the piece,

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000
and so I had auditions.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000
And a number of sopranos uploaded their parts.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000
I was told later,

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000
and also by lots of singers who were involved in this,

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000
that they sometimes recorded 50 or 60 different takes

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.000
until they got just the right take -- they uploaded it.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000
Here's our winner of the soprano solo.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.000
This is Melody Myers from Tennessee.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:43.000
(Singing)

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.000
I love the little smile she does right over the top of the note --

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.000
like, "No problem, everything's fine."

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000
(Laughter)

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000
And from the crowd

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.000
emerged this young man, Scott Haines.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000
And he said, "Listen, this is the project

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000
I've been looking for my whole life.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000
I'd like to be the person to edit this all together."

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000
I said, "Thank you, Scott. I'm so glad that you found me."

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000
And Scott aggregated all of the videos.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000
He scrubbed the audio.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.000
He made sure that everything lined up.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.000
And then we posted this video to YouTube about a year and a half ago.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000
This is "Lux Aurumque" sung by the Virtual Choir.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:24.000
(Singing)

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:37.000
I'll stop it there in the interest of time.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:41.000
(Applause)

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:45.000
Thank you. Thank you.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:53.000
(Applause)

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.000
Thank you.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:58.000
So there's more. There's more.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000
Thank you so much.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000
And I had the same reaction you did.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000
I actually was moved to tears when I first saw it.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:07.000
I just couldn't believe the poetry of all of it --

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:11.000
these souls all on their own desert island,

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:14.000
sending electronic messages in bottles to each other.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.000
And the video went viral.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.000
We had a million hits in the first month

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.000
and got a lot of attention for it.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.000
And because of that, then a lot of singers started saying,

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.000
"All right, what's Virtual Choir 2.0?"

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000
And so I decided for Virtual Choir 2.0

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:29.000
that I would choose the same piece that Britlin was singing,

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000
"Sleep," which is another work

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.000
that I wrote in the year 2000 --

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.000
poetry by my dear friend Charles Anthony Silvestri.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.000
And again, I posted a conductor video,

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:40.000
and we started accepting submissions.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:43.000
This time we got some more mature members.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:53.000
(Singing)

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:56.000
And some younger members.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:01.000
(Video) Soprano: ♫ Upon my pillow ♫

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:05.000
♫ Safe in bed ♫

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:08.000
EW: That's Georgie from England. She's only nine.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:11.000
Isn't that the sweetest thing you've ever seen?

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.000
Someone did all eight videos --

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.000
a bass even singing the soprano parts.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.000
This is Beau Awtin.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:24.000
(Video) Beau Awtin: ♫ Safe in bed ♫

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:27.000
EW: And our goal -- it was sort of an arbitrary goal --

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.000
there was an MTV video where they all sang "Lollipop"

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:32.000
and they got people from all over the world to just sing that little melody.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.000
And there were 900 people involved in that.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.000
So I told the singers, "That's our goal.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.000
That's the number for us to beat."

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:41.000
And we just closed submissions January 10th,

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:44.000
and our final tally was 2,051 videos

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.000
from 58 different countries.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.000
Thank you.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:51.000
(Applause)

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:54.000
From Malta, Madagascar, Thailand, Vietnam,

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:57.000
Jordan, Egypt, Israel,

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:00.000
as far north as Alaska and as far south as New Zealand.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:04.000
And we also put a page on Facebook

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:07.000
for the singers to upload their testimonials,

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:10.000
what it was like for them, their experience singing it.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.000
And I've just chosen a few of them here.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.000
"My sister and I used to sing in choirs together constantly.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:17.000
Now she's an airman in the air force constantly traveling.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:20.000
It's so wonderful to sing together again!"

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.000
I love the idea that she's singing with her sister.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.000
"Aside from the beautiful music,

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:27.000
it's great just to know I'm part of a worldwide community of people I never met before,

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.000
but who are connected anyway."

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.000
And my personal favorite,

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:33.000
"When I told my husband that I was going to be a part of this,

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.000
he told me that I did not have the voice for it."

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.000
Yeah, I'm sure a lot of you have heard that too.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.000
Me too.

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.000
"It hurt so much, and I shed some tears,

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:44.000
but something inside of me wanted to do this despite his words.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:47.000
It is a dream come true to be part of this choir,

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.000
as I've never been part of one.

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.000
When I placed a marker on the Google Earth Map,

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:54.000
I had to go with the nearest city, which is about 400 miles away from where I live.

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.000
As I am in the Great Alaskan Bush,

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:59.000
satellite is my connection to the world."

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:02.000
So two things struck me deeply about this.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:04.000
The first is that human beings

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:06.000
will go to any lengths necessary

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:09.000
to find and connect with each other.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.000
It doesn't matter the technology.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.000
And the second is

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:16.000
that people seem to be experiencing an actual connection.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:19.000
It wasn't a virtual choir.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:22.000
There are people now online that are friends; they've never met.

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.000
But, I know myself too, I feel

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:27.000
this virtual esprit de corps, if you will, with all of them.

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.000
I feel a closeness to this choir --

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:32.000
almost like a family.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.000
What I'd like to close with then today

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.000
is the first look

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.000
at "Sleep" by Virtual Choir 2.0.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.000
This will be a premiere today.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:42.000
We're not finished with the video yet.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:45.000
You can imagine, with 2,000 synchronized YouTube videos,

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:48.000
the render time is just atrocious.

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.000
But we do have the first three minutes.

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.000
And it's a tremendous honor

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:55.000
for me to be able to show it to you here first.

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:57.000
You're the very first people to see this.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:00.000
This is "Sleep," the Virtual Choir.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:06.000
(Video) Virtual Choir: ♫ The evening hangs ♫

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:15.000
♫ beneath the moon ♫

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:27.000
♫ A silver thread on darkened dune ♫

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:37.000
♫ With closing eyes and resting head ♫

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:52.000
♫ I know that sleep is coming soon ♫

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:57.000
♫ Upon my pillow, ♫

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:05.000
♫ safe in bed, ♫

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:17.000
♫ a thousand pictures fill my head ♫

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:20.000
♫ I cannot sleep ♫

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:25.000
♫ my mind's aflight ♫

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:39.000
♫ and yet my limbs seem made of lead ♫

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:52.000
♫ If there are noises in the night ♫

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:55.000
Eric Whitacre: Thank you very, very much. Thank you.

00:13:55.000 --> 00:14:05.000
(Applause)

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:08.000
Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you.

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:13.000
(Applause)
