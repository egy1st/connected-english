00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
I'm a huge believer in hands-on education.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
But you have to have the right tools.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
If I'm going to teach my daughter about electronics,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
I'm not going to give her a soldering iron.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
And similarly, she finds prototyping boards

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
really frustrating for her little hands.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
So my wonderful student Sam and I

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
decided to look at the most tangible thing we could think of:

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Play-Doh.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
And so we spent a summer

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
looking at different Play-Doh recipes.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
And these recipes probably look really familiar

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
to any of you who have made homemade play-dough --

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
pretty standard ingredients you probably have in your kitchen.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
We have two favorite recipes --

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
one that has these ingredients

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
and a second that had sugar instead of salt.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
And they're great. We can make great little sculptures with these.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
But the really cool thing about them is when we put them together.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
You see that really salty Play-Doh?

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
Well, it conducts electricity.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
And this is nothing new.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
It turns out that regular Play-Doh that you buy at the store conducts electricity,

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
and high school physics teachers have used that for years.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
But our homemade play-dough

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
actually has half the resistance of commercial Play-Doh.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
And that sugar dough?

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
Well it's 150 times more resistant to electric current

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
than that salt dough.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
So what does that mean?

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
Well it means if you them together you suddenly have circuits --

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
circuits that the most creative, tiny, little hands

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
can build on their own.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.000
(Applause)

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
And so I want to do a little demo for you.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
So if I take this salt dough,

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
again, it's like the play-dough you probably made as kids,

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
and I plug it in --

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
it's a two-lead battery pack, simple battery pack,

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
you can buy them at Radio Shack

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
and pretty much anywhere else --

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
we can actually then

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
light things up.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
But if any of you have studied electrical engineering,

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
we can also create a short circuit.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
If I push these together, the light turns off.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
Right, the current wants to run through the play-dough, not through that LED.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
If I separate them again, I have some light.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
Well now if I take that sugar dough,

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
the sugar dough doesn't want to conduct electricity.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
It's like a wall to the electricity.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
If I place that between, now all the dough is touching,

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
but if I stick that light back in,

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
I have light.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000
In fact, I could even add some movement to my sculptures.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
If I want a spinning tail, let's grab a motor,

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000
put some play-dough on it, stick it on

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
and we have spinning.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.000
(Applause)

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
And once you have the basics,

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
we can make a slightly more complicated circuit.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
We call this our sushi circuit. It's very popular with kids.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000
I plug in again the power to it.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000
And now I can start talking about parallel and series circuits.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000
I can start plugging in lots of lights.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000
And we can start talking about things like electrical load.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
What happens if I put in lots of lights

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
and then add a motor?

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000
It'll dim.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.000
We can even add microprocessors

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
and have this as an input

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
and create squishy sound music that we've done.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
You could do parallel and series circuits

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000
for kids using this.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000
So this is all in your home kitchen.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000
We've actually tried to turn it into an electrical engineering lab.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000
We have a website, it's all there. These are the home recipes.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
We've got some videos. You can make them yourselves.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000
And it's been really fun since we put them up to see where these have gone.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
We've had a mom in Utah who used them with her kids,

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000
to a science researcher in the U.K.,

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.000
and curriculum developers in Hawaii.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
So I would encourage you all to grab some Play-Doh,

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.000
grab some salt, grab some sugar and start playing.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.000
We don't usually think of our kitchen as an electrical engineering lab

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000
or little kids as circuit designers,

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000
but maybe we should.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000
Have fun. Thank you.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:47.000
(Applause)
