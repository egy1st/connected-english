00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Ten years ago, on a Tuesday morning,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
I conducted a parachute jump at Fort Bragg, North Carolina.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
It was a routine training jump, like many more I'd done

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
since I became a paratrooper

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
27 years before.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
We went down to the airfield early

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
because this is the Army and you always go early.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
You do some routine refresher training,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
and then you go to put on your parachute and a buddy helps you.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
And you put on the T-10 parachute.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
And you're very careful how you put the straps,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
particularly the leg straps because they go between your legs.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
And then you put on your reserve, and then you put on your heavy rucksack.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
And then a jumpmaster comes,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
and he's an experienced NCO in parachute operations.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
He checks you out, he grabs your adjusting straps

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
and he tightens everything

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
so that your chest is crushed,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
your shoulders are crushed down,

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
and, of course, he's tightened so your voice goes up a couple octaves as well.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Then you sit down, and you wait a little while,

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
because this is the Army.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
Then you load the aircraft, and then you stand up and you get on,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
and you kind of lumber to the aircraft like this, in a line of people,

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
and you sit down on canvas seats on either side of the aircraft.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
And you wait a little bit longer,

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
because this is the Air Force teaching the Army how to wait.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
Then you take off.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
And it's painful enough now --

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
and I think it's designed this way --

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
it's painful enough so you want to jump.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
You didn't really want to jump, but you want out.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
So you get in the aircraft, you're flying along,

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
and at 20 minutes out, these jumpmasters start giving you commands.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
They give 20 minutes -- that's a time warning.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
You sit there, OK.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
Then they give you 10 minutes.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
And of course, you're responding with all of these.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
And that's to boost everybody's confidence, to show that you're not scared.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
Then they give you, "Get ready."

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
Then they go, "Outboard personnel, stand up."

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
If you're an outboard personnel, now you stand up.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
If you're an inboard personnel, stand up.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
And then you hook up, and you hook up your static line.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
And at that point, you think, "Hey, guess what?

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
I'm probably going to jump.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
There's no way to get out of this at this point."

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000
You go through some additional checks, and then they open the door.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
And this was that Tuesday morning in September,

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
and it was pretty nice outside.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
So nice air comes flowing in.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
The jumpmasters start to check the door.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
And then when it's time to go,

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
a green light goes and the jumpmaster goes, "Go."

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
The first guy goes, and you're just in line,

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
and you just kind of lumber to the door.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
Jump is a misnomer; you fall.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
You fall outside the door,

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
you're caught in the slipstream.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
The first thing you do is lock into a tight body position --

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
head down in your chest, your arms extended,

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000
put over your reserve parachute.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000
You do that because, 27 years before,

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000
an airborne sergeant had taught me to do that.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
I have no idea whether it makes any difference,

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
but he seemed to make sense,

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000
and I wasn't going to test the hypothesis that he'd be wrong.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
And then you wait for the opening shock

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
for your parachute to open.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
If you don't get an opening shock, you don't get a parachute --

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
you've got a whole new problem set.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
But typically you do; typically it opens.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
And of course, if your leg straps aren't set right,

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
at that point you get another little thrill.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
Boom.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
So then you look around,

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
you're under a canopy and you say, "This is good."

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
Now you prepare for the inevitable.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000
You are going to hit the ground.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
You can't delay that much.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
And you really can't decide where you hit very much,

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000
because they pretend you can steer,

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000
but you're being delivered.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000
So you look around, where you're going to land,

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000
you try to make yourself ready.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.000
And then as you get close, you lower your rucksack below you on a lowering line,

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
so that it's not on you when you land,

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
and you prepare to do a parachute-landing fall.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000
Now the Army teaches you

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000
to do five points of performance --

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000
the toes of your feet,

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000
your calves, your thighs,

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.000
your buttocks and your push-up muscles.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.000
It's this elegant little land, twist and roll.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000
And that's not going to hurt.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.000
In 30-some years of jumping, I never did one.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000
(Laughter)

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.000
I always landed like a watermelon out of a third floor window.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000
(Laughter)

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000
And as soon as I hit,

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000
the first thing I did is I'd see if I'd broken anything that I needed.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000
I'd shake my head,

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000
and I'd ask myself the eternal question:

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000
"Why didn't I go into banking?"

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000
(Laughter)

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000
And I'd look around,

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000
and then I'd see another paratrooper,

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000
a young guy or girl,

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000
and they'd have pulled out their M4 carbine

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000
and they'd be picking up their equipment.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.000
They'd be doing everything

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000
that we had taught them.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000
And I realized

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.000
that, if they had to go into combat,

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.000
they would do what we had taught them and they would follow leaders.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.000
And I realized that, if they came out of combat,

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000
it would be because we led them well.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.000
And I was hooked again on the importance of what I did.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000
So now I do that Tuesday morning jump,

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000
but it's not any jump --

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.000
that was September 11th, 2001.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.000
And when we took off from the airfield, America was at peace.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.000
When we landed on the drop-zone, everything had changed.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000
And what we thought

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000
about the possibility of those young soldiers going into combat

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000
as being theoretical

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000
was now very, very real --

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000
and leadership seemed important.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000
But things had changed;

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000
I was a 46-year-old brigadier general.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000
I'd been successful,

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000
but things changed so much

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000
that I was going to have to make some significant changes,

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.000
and on that morning, I didn't know it.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.000
I was raised with traditional stories of leadership:

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.000
Robert E. Lee, John Buford at Gettysburg.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000
And I also was raised

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.000
with personal examples of leadership.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.000
This was my father in Vietnam.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000
And I was raised to believe

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000
that soldiers were strong and wise

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000
and brave and faithful;

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000
they didn't lie, cheat, steal

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000
or abandon their comrades.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.000
And I still believe real leaders are like that.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000
But in my first 25 years of career,

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.000
I had a bunch of different experiences.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000
One of my first battalion commanders,

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.000
I worked in his battalion for 18 months

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:07.000
and the only conversation he ever had with Lt. McChrystal

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.000
was at mile 18 of a 25-mile road march,

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000
and he chewed my ass for about 40 seconds.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.000
And I'm not sure that was real interaction.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.000
But then a couple of years later, when I was a company commander,

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000
I went out to the National Training Center.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000
And we did an operation,

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000
and my company did a dawn attack --

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000
you know, the classic dawn attack:

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000
you prepare all night, move to the line of departure.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000
And I had an armored organization at that point.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000
We move forward, and we get wiped out --

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000
I mean, wiped out immediately.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.000
The enemy didn't break a sweat doing it.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000
And after the battle,

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.000
they bring this mobile theater and they do what they call an "after action review"

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000
to teach you what you've done wrong.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.000
Sort of leadership by humiliation.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.000
They put a big screen up, and they take you through everything:

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.000
"and then you didn't do this, and you didn't do this, etc."

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000
I walked out feeling as low

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000
as a snake's belly in a wagon rut.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.000
And I saw my battalion commander, because I had let him down.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000
And I went up to apologize to him,

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.000
and he said, "Stanley, I thought you did great."

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.000
And in one sentence,

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:08.000
he lifted me, put me back on my feet,

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:11.000
and taught me that leaders can let you fail

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.000
and yet not let you be a failure.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.000
When 9/11 came,

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.000
46-year-old Brig. Gen. McChrystal sees a whole new world.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:25.000
First, the things that are obvious, that you're familiar with:

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.000
the environment changed --

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000
the speed, the scrutiny,

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000
the sensitivity of everything now is so fast,

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.000
sometimes it evolves faster

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.000
than people have time to really reflect on it.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.000
But everything we do

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:40.000
is in a different context.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.000
More importantly, the force that I led

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:45.000
was spread over more than 20 countries.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.000
And instead of being able to get all the key leaders

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.000
for a decision together in a single room

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.000
and look them in the eye and build their confidence

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.000
and get trust from them,

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:56.000
I'm now leading a force that's dispersed,

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:59.000
and I've got to use other techniques.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:02.000
I've got to use video teleconferences, I've got to use chat,

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000
I've got to use email, I've got to use phone calls --

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:07.000
I've got to use everything I can,

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.000
not just for communication,

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.000
but for leadership.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.000
A 22-year-old individual

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.000
operating alone,

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.000
thousands of miles from me,

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:20.000
has got to communicate to me with confidence.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:23.000
I have to have trust in them and vice versa.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:26.000
And I also have to build their faith.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000
And that's a new kind of leadership

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.000
for me.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000
We had one operation

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.000
where we had to coordinate it from multiple locations.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.000
An emerging opportunity came --

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.000
didn't have time to get everybody together.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.000
So we had to get complex intelligence together,

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.000
we had to line up the ability to act.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:47.000
It was sensitive, we had to go up the chain of command,

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.000
convince them that this was the right thing to do

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000
and do all of this

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:54.000
on electronic medium.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:57.000
We failed.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.000
The mission didn't work.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.000
And so now what we had to do

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.000
is I had to reach out

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.000
to try to rebuild the trust of that force,

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.000
rebuild their confidence --

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.000
me and them, and them and me,

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.000
and our seniors and us as a force --

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.000
all without the ability to put a hand on a shoulder.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:18.000
Entirely new requirement.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:22.000
Also, the people had changed.

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.000
You probably think that the force that I led

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:27.000
was all steely-eyed commandos with big knuckle fists

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:30.000
carrying exotic weapons.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.000
In reality,

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.000
much of the force I led

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:37.000
looked exactly like you.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:40.000
It was men, women, young, old --

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:43.000
not just from military; from different organizations,

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:46.000
many of them detailed to us just from a handshake.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.000
And so instead of giving orders,

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.000
you're now building consensus

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:53.000
and you're building a sense of shared purpose.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.000
Probably the biggest change

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:59.000
was understanding that the generational difference,

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:02.000
the ages, had changed so much.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:05.000
I went down to be with a Ranger platoon

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.000
on an operation in Afghanistan,

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.000
and on that operation,

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.000
a sergeant in the platoon

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.000
had lost about half his arm

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.000
throwing a Taliban hand grenade

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:17.000
back at the enemy

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:20.000
after it had landed in his fire team.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.000
We talked about the operation,

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:26.000
and then at the end I did what I often do with a force like that.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:29.000
I asked, "Where were you on 9/11?"

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.000
And one young Ranger in the back --

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.000
his hair's tousled and his face is red and windblown

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:38.000
from being in combat in the cold Afghan wind --

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:41.000
he said, "Sir, I was in the sixth grade."

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:45.000
And it reminded me

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.000
that we're operating a force

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.000
that must have shared purpose

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.000
and shared consciousness,

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:53.000
and yet he has different experiences,

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:56.000
in many cases a different vocabulary,

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.000
a completely different skill set

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:01.000
in terms of digital media

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:04.000
than I do and many of the other senior leaders.

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:08.000
And yet, we need to have that shared sense.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.000
It also produced something

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.000
which I call an inversion of expertise,

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:17.000
because we had so many changes at the lower levels

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.000
in technology and tactics and whatnot,

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:22.000
that suddenly the things that we grew up doing

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:25.000
wasn't what the force was doing anymore.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.000
So how does a leader

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.000
stay credible and legitimate

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.000
when they haven't done

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:34.000
what the people you're leading are doing?

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.000
And it's a brand new leadership challenge.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:39.000
And it forced me to become a lot more transparent,

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.000
a lot more willing to listen,

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:45.000
a lot more willing to be reverse-mentored from lower.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:49.000
And yet, again, you're not all in one room.

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.000
Then another thing.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.000
There's an effect on you and on your leaders.

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:57.000
There's an impact, it's cumulative.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:01.000
You don't reset, or recharge your battery every time.

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.000
I stood in front of a screen one night in Iraq

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:05.000
with one of my senior officers

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:07.000
and we watched a firefight from one of our forces.

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:10.000
And I remembered his son was in our force.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:13.000
And I said, "John, where's your son? And how is he?"

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:15.000
And he said, "Sir, he's fine. Thanks for asking."

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:17.000
I said, "Where is he now?"

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:20.000
And he pointed at the screen, he said, "He's in that firefight."

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:23.000
Think about watching your brother, father,

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:26.000
daughter, son, wife

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.000
in a firefight in real time

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.000
and you can't do anything about it.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.000
Think about knowing that over time.

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.000
And it's a new cumulative pressure on leaders.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:37.000
And you have to watch and take care of each other.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:42.000
I probably learned the most about relationships.

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:46.000
I learned they are the sinew

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.000
which hold the force together.

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:51.000
I grew up much of my career in the Ranger regiment.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.000
And every morning in the Ranger regiment,

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.000
every Ranger -- and there are more than 2,000 of them --

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:58.000
says a six-stanza Ranger creed.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.000
You may know one line of it, it says,

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:03.000
"I'll never leave a fallen comrade to fall into the hands of the enemy."

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:05.000
And it's not a mindless mantra,

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:07.000
and it's not a poem.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:09.000
It's a promise.

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:11.000
Every Ranger promises every other Ranger,

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:14.000
"No matter what happens, no matter what it costs me,

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:17.000
if you need me, I'm coming."

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:19.000
And every Ranger gets that same promise

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:21.000
from every other Ranger.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.000
Think about it. It's extraordinarily powerful.

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:26.000
It's probably more powerful than marriage vows.

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:31.000
And they've lived up to it, which gives it special power.

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:35.000
And so the organizational relationship that bonds them

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:37.000
is just amazing.

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:39.000
And I learned personal relationships

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:41.000
were more important than ever.

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:44.000
We were in a difficult operation in Afghanistan in 2007,

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:46.000
and an old friend of mine,

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.000
that I had spent many years

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.000
at various points of my career with --

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:53.000
godfather to one of their kids --

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:56.000
he sent me a note, just in an envelope,

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:58.000
that had a quote from Sherman to Grant

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:01.000
that said, "I knew if I ever got in a tight spot,

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:04.000
that you would come, if alive."

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:07.000
And having that kind of relationship, for me,

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:10.000
turned out to be critical at many points in my career.

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:12.000
And I learned that you have to give that

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:14.000
in this environment,

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:17.000
because it's tough.

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:19.000
That was my journey.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:21.000
I hope it's not over.

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:23.000
I came to believe

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:25.000
that a leader isn't good because they're right;

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:28.000
they're good because they're willing to learn and to trust.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:33.000
This isn't easy stuff.

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:35.000
It's not like that electronic abs machine

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:37.000
where, 15 minutes a month, you get washboard abs.

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.000
(Laughter)

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:42.000
And it isn't always fair.

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:45.000
You can get knocked down,

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:47.000
and it hurts

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:50.000
and it leaves scars.

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:52.000
But if you're a leader,

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:55.000
the people you've counted on

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:57.000
will help you up.

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:00.000
And if you're a leader,

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:03.000
the people who count on you need you on your feet.

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:05.000
Thank you.

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:17.000
(Applause)
