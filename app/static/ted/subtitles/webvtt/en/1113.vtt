00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
So what does the happiest man in the world look like?

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
He certainly doesn't look like me.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
He looks like this.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
His name is Matthieu Ricard.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
So how do you get to be the happiest man in the world?

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Well it turns out

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
there is a way to measure happiness in the brain.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
And you do that by measuring the relative activation

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
of the left prefrontal cortex in the fMRI,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
versus the right prefrontal cortex.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
And Matthieu's happiness measure

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
is off the charts.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
He's by far the happiest man

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
ever measured by science.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
Which leads us to a question:

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
What was he thinking when he was being measured?

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Perhaps something very naughty.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
(Laughter)

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
Actually, he was meditating

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
on compassion.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
Matthieu's own experience

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000
is that compassion is the happiest state ever.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
Reading about Matthieu

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
was one of the pivotal moments of my life.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
My dream

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
is to create the conditions

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
for world peace in my lifetime --

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
and to do that

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
by creating the conditions

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
for inner peace

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
and compassion

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
on a global scale.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
And learning about Matthieu

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
gave me a new angle to look at my work.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
Matthieu's brain scan shows

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
that compassion is not a chore.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000
Compassion is something that creates happiness.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
Compassion is fun.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
And that mind-blowing insight

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
changes the entire game.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
Because if compassion was a chore,

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
nobody's going to do it,

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
except maybe the Dalai Lama or something.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
But if compassion was fun,

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
everybody's going to do it.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
Therefore,

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
to create the conditions for global compassion,

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
all we have to do

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
is to reframe compassion

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
as something that is fun.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
But fun is not enough.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
What if compassion

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000
is also profitable?

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
What if compassion is also good for business?

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
Then, every boss, every manager in the world,

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
will want to have compassion --

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
like this.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
That would create the conditions

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
for world peace.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
So, I started paying attention

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
to what compassion looks like in a business setting.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
Fortunately, I didn't have to look very far.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
Because what I was looking for was right in front of my eyes --

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000
in Google, my company.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
I know there are other compassionate companies in the world,

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
but Google is the place I'm familiar with

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
because I've been there for 10 years,

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000
so I'll use Google as the case study.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
Google is a company

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
born of idealism.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000
It's a company that thrives on idealism.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
And maybe because of that,

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
compassion is organic

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000
and widespread company-wide.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000
In Google, expressions of corporate compassion

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
almost always follow the same pattern.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
It's sort of a funny pattern.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000
It starts with a small group of Googlers

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000
taking the initiative to do something.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000
And they don't usually ask for permission;

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
they just go ahead and do it,

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.000
and then other Googlers join in, and it just gets bigger and bigger.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000
And sometimes it gets big enough

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000
to become official.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000
So in other words,

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.000
it almost always starts from the bottom up.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000
And let me give you some examples.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:49.000
The first example is the largest annual community event --

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000
where Googlers from around the world

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000
donate their labor to their local communities --

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000
was initiated and organized

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000
by three employees

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000
before it became official,

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
because it just became too big.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000
Another example, three Googlers --

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.000
a chef, an engineer

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.000
and, most funny, a massage therapist --

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.000
three of them, they learned about a region in India

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000
where 200,000 people live

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000
without a single medical facility.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000
So what do they do?

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.000
They just go ahead and start a fundraiser.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.000
And they raise enough money to build this hospital --

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000
the first hospital of its kind

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000
for 200,000 people.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000
During the Haiti earthquake,

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.000
a number of engineers and product managers

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000
spontaneously came together

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000
and stayed overnight

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000
to build a tool

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.000
to allow earthquake victims to find their loved ones.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000
And expressions of compassion

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.000
are also found in our international offices.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000
In China for example,

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000
one mid-level employee

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:58.000
initiated the largest social action competition in China,

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000
involving more than 1,000 schools in China,

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000
working on issues

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000
such as education, poverty,

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.000
health care and the environment.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000
There is so much organic social action

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000
all around Google

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000
that the company decided to form

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000
a social responsibility team

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000
just to support these efforts.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000
And this idea, again,

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000
came from the grassroots,

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.000
from two Googlers who wrote their own job descriptions

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.000
and volunteered themselves for the job.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000
And I found it fascinating

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000
that the social responsibility team

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.000
was not formed as part of some grand corporate strategy.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.000
It was two persons saying, "Let's do this,"

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.000
and the company said, "Yes."

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.000
So it turns out

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000
that Google is a compassionate company,

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.000
because Googlers found

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.000
compassion to be fun.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.000
But again, fun is not enough.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.000
There are also real business benefits.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000
So what are they?

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000
The first benefit of compassion

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:07.000
is that it creates highly effective business leaders.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000
What does that mean?

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000
There are three components of compassion.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.000
There is the affective component,

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000
which is, "I feel for you."

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.000
There is the cognitive component,

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.000
which is, "I understand you."

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.000
And there is a motivational component,

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.000
which is, "I want to help you."

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.000
So what has this got to do with business leadership?

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.000
According to a very comprehensive study

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.000
led by Jim Collins,

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.000
and documented in the book "Good to Great,"

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.000
it takes a very special kind of leader

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.000
to bring a company

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:46.000
from goodness to greatness.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:49.000
And he calls them "Level 5 leaders."

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000
These are leaders

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.000
who, in addition to being highly capable,

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.000
possess two important qualities,

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.000
and they are

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.000
humility and ambition.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000
These are leaders

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:07.000
who are highly ambitious for the greater good.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000
And because they're ambitious for a greater good,

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.000
they feel no need to inflate their own egos.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.000
And they, according to the research,

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.000
make the best business leaders.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.000
And if you look at these qualities

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.000
in the context of compassion,

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.000
we find

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:28.000
that the cognitive and affective components of compassion --

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:32.000
understanding people and empathizing with people --

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.000
inhibits, tones down,

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:39.000
what I call the excessive self-obsession that's in us,

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.000
therefore creating the conditions

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:44.000
for humility.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:47.000
The motivational component of compassion

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:50.000
creates ambition for greater good.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000
In other words,

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:56.000
compassion is the way to grow Level 5 leaders.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:00.000
And this is the first compelling business benefit.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.000
The second compelling benefit of compassion

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.000
is that it creates an inspiring workforce.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:10.000
Employees mutually inspire each other

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000
towards greater good.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.000
It creates a vibrant, energetic community

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:17.000
where people admire and respect each other.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.000
I mean, you come to work in the morning,

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.000
and you work with three guys

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:24.000
who just up and decide to build a hospital in India.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:28.000
It's like how can you not be inspired by those people --

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.000
your own coworkers?

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.000
So this mutual inspiration

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.000
promotes collaboration,

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.000
initiative and creativity.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:41.000
It makes us a highly effective company.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.000
So, having said all that,

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.000
what is the secret formula

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:48.000
for brewing compassion

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000
in the corporate setting?

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.000
In our experience,

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.000
there are three ingredients.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.000
The first ingredient

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:59.000
is to create a culture

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.000
of passionate concern

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.000
for the greater good.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.000
So always think:

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:08.000
how is your company and your job

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.000
serving the greater good?

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.000
Or, how can you further serve

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.000
the greater good?

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:17.000
This awareness of serving the greater good

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.000
is very self-inspiring

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.000
and it creates fertile ground

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.000
for compassion to grow in.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.000
That's one.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.000
The second ingredient

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.000
is autonomy.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:32.000
So in Google, there's a lot of autonomy.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.000
And one of our most popular managers jokes that,

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.000
this is what he says,

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.000
"Google is a place

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:41.000
where the inmates run the asylum."

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:44.000
And he considers himself one of the inmates.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.000
If you already have

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.000
a culture of compassion

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.000
and idealism

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.000
and you let your people roam free,

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.000
they will do the right thing

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:57.000
in the most compassionate way.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.000
The third ingredient

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:02.000
is to focus on inner development

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.000
and personal growth.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:07.000
Leadership training in Google, for example,

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:10.000
places a lot of emphasis on the inner qualities,

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:13.000
such as self-awareness, self-mastery,

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:16.000
empathy and compassion,

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.000
because we believe

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.000
that leadership begins

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:23.000
with character.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.000
We even created a seven-week curriculum

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.000
on emotion intelligence,

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:31.000
which we jokingly call "Searching Inside Yourself."

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:34.000
It's less naughty than it sounds.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.000
So I'm an engineer by training,

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:41.000
but I'm one of the creators and instructors of this course,

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.000
which I find kind of funny,

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.000
because this is a company that trusts an engineer

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.000
to teach emotion intelligence.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.000
What a company.

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.000
(Laughter)

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:54.000
So "Search Inside Yourself" -- how does it work?

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.000
It works in three steps.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.000
The first step

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.000
is attention training.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:03.000
Attention is the basis

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:08.000
of all higher cognitive and emotional abilities.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.000
Therefore, any curriculum

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.000
for training emotion intelligence

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:17.000
has to begin with attention training.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:20.000
The idea here is to train attention

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.000
to create a quality of mind

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.000
that is calm and clear

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:27.000
at the same time.

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.000
And this creates the foundation

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:32.000
for emotion intelligence.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:35.000
The second step follows the first step.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:38.000
The second step is developing self-knowledge

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.000
and self-mastery.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:44.000
So using the supercharged attention from step one,

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:47.000
we create a high-resolution perception

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:50.000
into the cognitive and emotive processes.

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.000
What does that mean?

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:56.000
It means being able to observe our thought stream

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.000
and the process of emotion

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.000
with high clarity,

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.000
objectivity

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:05.000
and from a third-person perspective.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:07.000
And once you can do that,

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:09.000
you create the kind of self-knowledge

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:12.000
that enables self-mastery.

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:16.000
The third step, following the second step,

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.000
is to create new mental habits.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:21.000
What does that mean? Imagine this.

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:24.000
Imagine whenever you meet any other person,

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:26.000
any time you meet a person,

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:29.000
your habitual, instinctive first thought

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:31.000
is, "I want you to be happy.

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:33.000
I want you to be happy."

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:35.000
Imagine you can do that.

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:37.000
Having this habit, this mental habit,

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:40.000
changes everything at work.

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:42.000
Because this good will

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:45.000
is unconsciously picked up by other people,

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:48.000
and it creates trust,

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:51.000
and trust creates a lot of good working relationships.

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.000
And this also creates the conditions

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:57.000
for compassion in the workplace.

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:00.000
Someday, we hope to open-source

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.000
"Search Inside Yourself"

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:05.000
so that everybody in the corporate world

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:08.000
will at least be able to use it as a reference.

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:11.000
And in closing,

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:13.000
I want to end the same place I started,

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:15.000
with happiness.

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:19.000
I want to quote this guy -- the guy in robes, not the other guy --

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:21.000
the Dalai Lama,

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.000
who said, "If you want others to be happy,

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:25.000
practice compassion.

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:27.000
If you want to be happy,

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:29.000
practice compassion."

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:31.000
I found this to be true,

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.000
both on the individual level

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:35.000
and at a corporate level.

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:37.000
And I hope that compassion

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:39.000
will be both fun and profitable for you too.

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:41.000
Thank you.

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:47.000
(Applause)
