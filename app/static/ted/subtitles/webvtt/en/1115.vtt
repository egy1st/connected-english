00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
I have had the distinct blessing in my life

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
to have worked on a bunch of amazing projects.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
But the coolest I ever worked on

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
was around this guy.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
This guy's name is TEMPT.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
TEMPT was one of the foremost graffiti artists in the 80s.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
And he came up home from a run one day

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
and said, "Dad, my legs are tingling."

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
And that was the onset of ALS.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
So TEMPT is now completely paralyzed.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
He only has use of his eyes.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
I was exposed to him.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
I have a company that does design and animation,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
so obviously graffiti is definitely an intricate part

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
of what we admire and respect in the art world.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
And so we decided that we were going to sponsor

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Tony, TEMPT, and his cause.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
So I went and met with his brother and father

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
and said, "We're going to give you this money.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
What are you going to do with it?"

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
And his brother said, "I just want to be able to talk to Tony again.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
I just want to be able to communicate with him

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
and him to be able to communicate with me."

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
And I said, "Wait a second, isn't that -- I've seen Stephen Hawking --

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
don't all paralyzed people have the ability to communicate

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
via these devices?"

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
And he said, "No, unless you're in the upper echelon and

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
you've got really amazing insurance,

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
you can't actually do that.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
These devices aren't accessible to people."

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
And I said, "Well, how do you actually communicate?"

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
Has everyone seen the movie "The Diving Bell and the Butterfly?"

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
That's how they communicate --

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
so run their finger along.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
I said, "That's archaic. How can that be?"

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.000
So I showed up with the desire to just write a check,

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
and instead, I wrote a check

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
that I had no freaking idea how I was going to cash.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
I committed to his brother and his father right then and there --

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
I'm like, "All right, here's the deal:

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
Tony's going to speak, we're going to get him a machine,

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
and we're going to figure out a way for him to do his art again.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
Because it's a travesty that someone who still has all of that in him

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
isn't able to communicate it."

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
So I spoke at a conference a couple months after that.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
I met these guys called GRL,

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
Graffiti Research Lab,

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
and they have a technology

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
that allows them to project a light onto any surface

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
and then, with a laser pointer, draw on it,

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
and it just registers the negative space.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000
So they go around and do art installations like this.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
All the things that go up there, they said there's a life cycle.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
First it starts with the sexual organs,

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
then it starts with cuss words,

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
then it was Bush slanders

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
and then people actually got to art.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000
But there was always a life cycle to their presentations.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
So I went home and was having dinner with my wife

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
and was telling her about this,

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
and we were like, "Well wait a second. If we know that this technology exists

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
where you can use your eyes to control things,

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
why don't we figure out a way for TEMPT to control a laser

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
and he could do graf again? Well that would be awesome."

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
So that started the journey.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000
And about two years later, about a year later,

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
after a bunch of organization

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
and a bunch of moving things around,

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000
we'd accomplished a couple things.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
One, we battered down the doors of the insurance companies,

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
and we actually got TEMPT a machine

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000
that let him communicate -- a Stephen Hawking machine.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
(Applause)

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
Which was awesome.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
And he's seriously one of the funniest -- I call him Yoda,

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
because you talk to the guy, you get an email from him,

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000
and you're like, "I'm not worthy. This guy's so amazing."

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
The other thing we did

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
is we flew seven programmers from all over the world --

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
literally every corner of the world --

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
into our house.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
My wife and kids and I moved to our back garage,

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
and these hackers and programmers

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000
and conspiracy theorists and anarchists took over our house.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000
A lot of our friends thought we were absolutely stupid to do that

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
and that we were going to come back

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000
and all the pictures on the wall would be removed and graf on the walls.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
But for over two weeks,

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
we programmed,

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
we went to the Venice boardwalk,

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.000
my kids got involved,

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000
my dog got involved,

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000
and we created this.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000
This is called the EyeWriter,

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000
and you can see the description.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000
This is a cheap pair of sunglasses

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000
that we bought at the Venice Beach boardwalk,

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000
some copper wire

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000
and some stuff from Home Depot and Radio Shack.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.000
We took a PS3 camera, hacked it open,

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000
mounted it to an LED light,

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.000
and now there's a device that is free --

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000
you build this yourself, we publish the code for free,

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
you download the software for free.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
And now we've created a device

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.000
that has absolutely no limitations.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000
There's no insurance company that can say "No."

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000
There's no hospital that can say "No."

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000
Anybody who's paralyzed now has access

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.000
to actually draw or communicate using only their eyes.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:23.000
(Applause)

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.000
Thank you.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
Thank you guys very much. That was awesome.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.000
So at the end of the two weeks,

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000
we went back to TEMPT's room.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000
I love this picture, because this is someone else's room

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000
and that's his room.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.000
So there's all this hustle and bustle going on for the big unveiling.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000
And after over a year of planning,

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000
two weeks of programming,

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000
carb-fest and all-night sessions,

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.000
Tony drew again for the first time in seven years.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000
And this is an amazing picture,

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000
because this is his life support system,

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000
and he's looking over his life support system.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000
We kicked his bed so that he could see out.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000
And we set up a projector

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000
on a wall out in the parking lot outside of his hospital.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000
And he drew again for the first time,

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000
in front of his family and friends --

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000
and you can only imagine

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000
what the feeling in the parking lot was.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.000
The funny thing was, we had to break into the parking lot too,

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000
so we totally felt like we were legit in the whole graf scene too.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000
(Laughter)

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.000
So at the end of this, he sent us an email,

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000
and this is what the email said:

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.000
"That was the first time I've drawn anything for seven years.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000
I feel like I had been held underwater,

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.000
and someone finally reached down

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.000
and pulled my head up so I could breathe."

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.000
Isn't that awesome?

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.000
(Applause)

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.000
So that's kind of our battle cry.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000
That's what keeps us going and keeps us developing.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.000
And we've got such a long way to go with this.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000
This is an amazing device,

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000
but it's the equivalent of an Etch A Sketch.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.000
And someone who has that kind of artistic potential deserves so much more.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000
So we're in the process of trying to figure out

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.000
how to make it better, faster, stronger.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.000
Since that time, we've had all kinds of acknowledgment.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.000
We've won a bunch of awards.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.000
Remember, it's free; none of us are making any money on this thing.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000
It's all coming out of our own pockets.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000
So the awards were like, "Oh, this is fantastic."

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000
Armstrong Twittered about us,

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000
and then in December, Time magazine honored us

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.000
as one of the top 50 inventions of 2010, which was really cool.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.000
(Applause)

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.000
The coolest thing about this --

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.000
and this is what's completing the whole circle --

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000
is that in April of this year,

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.000
at the Geffen MOCA in downtown Los Angeles,

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000
there's going to be an exhibition called "Art of the Streets."

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.000
And "Art of the Streets" is going to have

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.000
pretty much the bad-asses of the street art scene --

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.000
Banksy, Shepard Fairey, KAWS --

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.000
all of these guys will be there.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000
TEMPT's going to be in the show,

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000
which is pretty awesome.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.000
(Applause)

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:49.000
So basically this is my point:

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.000
If you see something that's not possible,

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000
make it possible.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000
Everything in this room wasn't possible --

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.000
this stage, this computer, this mic, the EyeWriter --

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000
wasn't possible at one point.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.000
Make it possible, everyone in this room.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.000
I'm not a programmer,

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.000
never done anything with ocular recognition technology,

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:10.000
but I just recognized something and associated myself with amazing people

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.000
so that we could make something happen.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.000
And this is the question I want everyone to ask yourself

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.000
every single day

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:19.000
when you come up with something you feel that needs to be done:

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:22.000
if not now, then when? And if not me, then who?

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.000
Thank you guys.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:28.000
(Applause)
