00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Can any of you

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
remember what you wanted to be

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
when you were 17?

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Do you know what I wanted to be?

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
I wanted to be a biker chick.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
(Laughter)

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
I wanted to race cars,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
and I wanted to be a cowgirl,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
and I wanted to be Mowgli from "The Jungle Book."

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Because they were all about being free,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
the wind in your hair -- just to be free.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
And on my seventeenth birthday,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
my parents, knowing how much I loved speed,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
gave me one driving lesson

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
for my seventeenth birthday.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Not that we could have afforded I drive,

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
but to give me the dream of driving.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
And on my seventeenth birthday,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
I accompanied my little sister

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
in complete innocence,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
as I always had all my life --

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
my visually impaired sister --

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
to go to see an eye specialist.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
Because big sisters

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
are always supposed to support their little sisters.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
And my little sister wanted to be a pilot --

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
God help her.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
So I used to get my eyes tested

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
just for fun.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
And on my seventeenth birthday,

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
after my fake eye exam,

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
the eye specialist just noticed it happened to be my birthday.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
And he said, "So what are you going to do to celebrate?"

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
And I took that driving lesson,

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.000
and I said, "I'm going to learn how to drive."

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
And then there was a silence --

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
one of those awful silences

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
when you know something's wrong.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
And he turned to my mother,

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.000
and he said, "You haven't told her yet?"

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
On my seventeenth birthday,

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
as Janis Ian would best say,

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000
I learned the truth at 17.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000
I am, and have been since birth,

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000
legally blind.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
And you know,

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
how on earth did I get to 17

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
and not know that?

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000
Well, if anybody says country music isn't powerful,

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000
let me tell you this:

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
I got there

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000
because my father's passion for Johnny Cash

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000
and a song, "A Boy Named Sue."

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000
I'm the eldest of three. I was born in 1971.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
And very shortly after my birth,

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000
my parents found out I had a condition called ocular albinism.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
And what the hell does that mean to you?

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
So let me just tell you, the great part of all of this?

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000
I can't see this clock and I can't see the timing,

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
so holy God, woohoo! (Laughter)

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
I might buy some more time.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
But more importantly, let me tell you --

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
I'm going to come up really close here. Don't freak out, Pat.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
Hey.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
See this hand?

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000
Beyond this hand is a world of Vaseline.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.000
Every man in this room, even you, Steve,

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
is George Clooney.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
(Laughter)

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000
And every woman, you are so beautiful.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000
And when I want to look beautiful, I step three feet away from the mirror,

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000
and I don't have to see these lines etched in my face

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
from all the squinting I've done all my life

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000
from all the dark lights.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
The really strange part is

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000
that, at three and a half, just before I was going to school,

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
my parents made a bizarre, unusual

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.000
and incredibly brave decision.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.000
No special needs schools.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
No labels.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.000
No limitations.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000
My ability and my potential.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000
And they decided to tell me

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000
that I could see.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.000
So just like Johnny Cash's Sue,

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.000
a boy given a girl's name,

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.000
I would grow up and learn from experience

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.000
how to be tough and how to survive,

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000
when they were no longer there to protect me,

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000
or just take it all away.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000
But more significantly,

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000
they gave me the ability

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
to believe,

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.000
totally, to believe that I could.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000
And so when I heard that eye specialist

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.000
tell me all the things, a big fat "no,"

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000
everybody imagines I was devastated.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.000
And don't get me wrong, because when I first heard it --

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000
aside from the fact that I thought he was insane --

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000
I got that thump in my chest,

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.000
just that "huh?"

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.000
But very quickly I recovered. It was like that.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
The first thing I thought about was my mom,

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
who was crying over beside me.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
And I swear to God, I walked out of his office,

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.000
"I will drive. I will drive.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.000
You're mad. I'll drive. I know I can drive."

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000
And with the same dogged determination

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.000
that my father had bred into me since I was such a child --

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000
he taught me how to sail,

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000
knowing I could never see where I was going, I could never see the shore,

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.000
and I couldn't see the sails, and I couldn't see the destination.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000
But he told me to believe

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000
and feel the wind in my face.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.000
And that wind in my face made me believe

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000
that he was mad and I would drive.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000
And for the next 11 years,

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000
I swore nobody would ever find out that I couldn't see,

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000
because I didn't want to be a failure,

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000
and I didn't want to be weak.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000
And I believed I could do it.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.000
So I rammed through life as only a Casey can do.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.000
And I was an archeologist, and then I broke things.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000
And then I managed a restaurant, and then I slipped on things.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000
And then I was a masseuse. And then I was a landscape gardener.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000
And then I went to business school.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000
And you know, disabled people are hugely educated.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.000
And then I went in and I got a global consulting job with Accenture.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.000
And they didn't even know.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.000
And it's extraordinary

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.000
how far belief can take you.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.000
In 1999,

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.000
two and a half years into that job,

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000
something happened.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.000
Wonderfully, my eyes decided, enough.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.000
And temporarily,

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000
very unexpectedly,

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000
they dropped.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.000
And I'm in one of the most competitive environments in the world,

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.000
where you work hard, play hard, you gotta be the best, you gotta be the best.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000
And two years in,

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.000
I really could see very little.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.000
And I found myself in front of an HR manager

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.000
in 1999,

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.000
saying something I never imagined that I would say.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000
I was 28 years old.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:18.000
I had built a persona all around what I could and couldn't do.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.000
And I simply said,

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.000
"I'm sorry.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:28.000
I can't see, and I need help."

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.000
Asking for help can be incredibly difficult.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.000
And you all know what it is. You don't need to have a disability to know that.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.000
We all know how hard it is

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000
to admit weakness and failure.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.000
And it's frightening, isn't it?

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.000
But all that belief had fueled me so long.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:47.000
And can I tell you, operating in the sighted world when you can't see,

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.000
it's kind of difficult -- it really is.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.000
Can I tell you, airports are a disaster.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000
Oh, for the love of God.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000
And please, any designers out there?

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.000
OK, designers, please put up your hands, even though I can't even see you.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.000
I always end up in the gents' toilets.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000
And there's nothing wrong with my sense of smell.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.000
But can I just tell you,

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.000
the little sign for a gents' toilet or a ladies' toilet

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000
is determined by a triangle.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.000
Have you ever tried to see that

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:17.000
if you have Vaseline in front of your eyes?

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.000
It's such a small thing, right?

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.000
And you know how exhausting it can be

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.000
to try to be perfect when you're not,

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.000
or to be somebody that you aren't?

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.000
And so after admitting I couldn't see to HR,

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000
they sent me off to an eye specialist.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.000
And I had no idea that this man was going to change my life.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:36.000
But before I got to him, I was so lost.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.000
I had no idea who I was anymore.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.000
And that eye specialist, he didn't bother testing my eyes.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.000
God no, it was therapy.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.000
And he asked me several questions,

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.000
of which many were, "Why?

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:49.000
Why are you fighting so hard

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.000
not to be yourself?

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:54.000
And do you love what you do, Caroline?"

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.000
And you know, when you go to a global consulting firm,

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.000
they put a chip in your head, and you're like,

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000
"I love Accenture. I love Accenture. I love my job. I love Accenture.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.000
I love Accenture. I love Accenture. I love my job. I love Accenture." (Laughter)

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.000
To leave would be failure.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.000
And he said, "Do you love it?"

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.000
I couldn't even speak I was so choked up.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:12.000
I just was so -- how do I tell him?

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.000
And then he said to me, "What did you want to be when you were little?"

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.000
Now listen, I wasn't going to say to him, "Well, I wanted to race cars and motorbikes."

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.000
Hardly appropriate at this moment in time.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.000
He thought I was mad enough anyway.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.000
And as I left his office,

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000
he called me back

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:29.000
and he said, "I think it's time.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000
I think it's time

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.000
to stop fighting and do something different."

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.000
And that door closed.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.000
And that silence just outside a doctor's office,

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:40.000
that many of us know.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000
And my chest ached.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.000
And I had no idea where I was going. I had no idea.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000
But I did know the game was up.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.000
And I went home, and, because the pain in my chest ached so much,

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000
I thought, "I'll go out for a run."

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.000
Really not a very sensible thing to do.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.000
And I went on a run that I know so well.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:57.000
I know this run so well, by the back of my hand.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.000
I always run it perfectly fine.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.000
I count the steps and the lampposts and all those things

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:04.000
that visually impaired people have a tendency to have a lot of meetings with.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.000
And there was a rock that I always missed.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.000
And I'd never fallen on it, never.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.000
And there I was crying away,

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.000
and smash, bash on my rock.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.000
Broken, fallen over

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.000
on this rock

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.000
in the middle of March in 2000,

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.000
typical Irish weather on a Wednesday --

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.000
gray, snot, tears everywhere,

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.000
ridiculously self-pitying.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.000
And I was floored, and I was broken,

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.000
and I was angry.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.000
And I didn't know what to do.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.000
And I sat there for quite some time going,

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.000
"How am I going to get off this rock and go home?

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.000
Because who am I going to be?

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.000
What am I going to be?"

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.000
And I thought about my dad,

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:44.000
and I thought, "Good God, I'm so not Sue now."

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.000
And I kept thinking over and over in my mind,

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:49.000
what had happened? Where did it go wrong? Why didn't I understand?

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.000
And you know, the extraordinary part of it

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.000
is I just simply had no answers.

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.000
I had lost my belief.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.000
Look where my belief had brought me to.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.000
And now I had lost it. And now I really couldn't see.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.000
I was crumpled.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:04.000
And then I remember thinking about that eye specialist

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:07.000
asking me, "What do you want to be? What do you want to be?

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.000
What did you want to be when you were little? Do you love what you do?

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.000
Do something different. What do you want to be?

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:14.000
Do something different. What do you want to be?"

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:17.000
And really slowly, slowly, slowly,

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.000
it happened.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:22.000
And it did happen this way.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.000
And then the minute it came,

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.000
it blew up in my head

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.000
and bashed in my heart --

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:31.000
something different.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:35.000
"Well, how about Mowgli from 'The Jungle Book'?

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:38.000
You don't get more different than that."

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.000
And the moment, and I mean the moment,

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.000
the moment that hit me,

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.000
I swear to God,

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:47.000
it was like woo hoo! You know -- something to believe in.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.000
And nobody can tell me no.

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.000
Yes, you can say I can't be an archeologist.

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:53.000
But you can't tell me, no, I can't be Mowgli, because guess what?

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.000
Nobody's ever done it before, so I'm going to go do it.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:58.000
And it doesn't matter whether I'm a boy or a girl, I'm just going to scoot.

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.000
And so I got off that rock, and, oh my God, did I run home.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:03.000
And I sprinted home, and I didn't fall, and I didn't crash.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:06.000
And I ran up the stairs, and there was one of my favorite books of all time,

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:09.000
"Travels on My Elephant" by Mark Shand -- I don't know if any of you know it.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.000
And I grabbed this book off, and I'm sitting on the couch

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.000
going, "I know what I'm going to do.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.000
I know how to be Mowgli.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.000
I'm going to go across India

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.000
on the back of an elephant.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:22.000
I'm going to be an elephant handler."

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.000
And I had no idea

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:28.000
how I was going to be an elephant handler.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:31.000
From global management consultant to elephant handler.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:34.000
I had no idea how. I had no idea how you hire an elephant, get an elephant.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:37.000
I didn't speak Hindi. I'd never been to India. Hadn't a clue.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.000
But I knew I would.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:42.000
Because, when you make a decision at the right time and the right place,

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:44.000
God, that universe makes it happen for you.

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:47.000
Nine months later, after that day on snot rock,

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.000
I had the only blind date in my life

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:53.000
with a seven and a half foot elephant called Kanchi.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.000
And together we would trek a thousand kilometers

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:57.000
across India.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.000
(Applause)

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.000
The most powerful thing of all,

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.000
it's not that I didn't achieve before then. Oh my God, I did.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:06.000
But you know, I was believing in the wrong thing.

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.000
Because I wasn't believing in me,

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.000
really me, all the bits of me --

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.000
all the bits of all of us.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:15.000
Do you know how much of us all pretend to be somebody we're not?

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:18.000
And you know what, when you really believe in yourself and everything about you,

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.000
it's extraordinary what happens.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.000
And you know what, that trip, that thousand kilometers,

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:25.000
it raised enough money for 6,000 cataract eye operations.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.000
Six thousand people got to see because of that.

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:29.000
When I came home off that elephant,

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:31.000
do you know what the most amazing part was?

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:33.000
I chucked in my job at Accenture.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:35.000
I left, and I became a social entrepreneur,

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:38.000
and I set up an organization with Mark Shand called Elephant Family,

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.000
which deals with Asian elephant conservation.

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:42.000
And I set up Kanchi,

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:45.000
because my organization was always going to be named after my elephant,

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:47.000
because disability is like the elephant in the room.

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:50.000
And I wanted to make you see it in a positive way --

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:52.000
no charity, no pity.

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.000
But I wanted to work only and truly

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.000
with business and media leadership

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.000
to totally reframe disability

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:01.000
in a way that was exciting and possible.

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:04.000
It was extraordinary.

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:06.000
That's what I wanted to do.

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.000
And I never thought about noes anymore, or not seeing,

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:10.000
or any of that kind of nothing.

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:13.000
It just seemed that it was possible.

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:16.000
And you know, the oddest part is,

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.000
when I was on my way traveling here to TED,

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:21.000
I'll be honest, I was petrified.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.000
And I speak,

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:25.000
but this is an amazing audience,

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:28.000
and what am I doing here?

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.000
But as I was traveling here,

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.000
you'll be very happy to know,

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.000
I did use my white symbol stick cane,

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:36.000
because it's really good to skip queues in the airport.

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.000
And I got my way here

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:41.000
being happily proud that I couldn't see.

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:43.000
And the one thing is that a really good friend of mine,

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:46.000
he texted me on the way over, knowing I was scared.

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.000
Even though I present confident, I was scared.

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:51.000
He said, "Be you."

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:53.000
And so here I am.

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:56.000
This is me, all of me.

00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:04.000
(Applause)

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:06.000
And I have learned, you know what,

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:09.000
cars and motorbikes and elephants,

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:11.000
that's not freedom.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:14.000
Being absolutely true to yourself is freedom.

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:17.000
And I never needed eyes to see -- never.

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:19.000
I simply needed vision and belief.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:21.000
And if you truly believe --

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:23.000
and I mean believe from the bottom of your heart --

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:25.000
you can make change happen.

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:27.000
And we need to make it happen,

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:29.000
because every single one of us --

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:32.000
woman, man, gay, straight,

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.000
disabled, perfect,

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:36.000
normal, whatever --

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:38.000
everyone of us

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:41.000
must be the very best of ourselves.

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:44.000
I no longer want anybody to be invisible.

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.000
We all have to be included.

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.000
And stop with the labels, the limiting.

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:50.000
Losing of labels,

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:52.000
because we are not jam jars.

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:55.000
We are extraordinary, different, wonderful people.

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:57.000
Thank you.

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:12.000
(Applause)
