00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
(Applause)

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Thank you.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:13.000
(Music)

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
♫ Slide into the shimmering surface ♫

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
♫ between two worlds. ♫

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
♫ Standing at the center of time ♫

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
♫ as it uncurls. ♫

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
♫ Cutting through the veil of illusion. ♫

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
♫ Moving beyond past conclusions. ♫

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.000
♫ Wondering if all my doubt and confusion will clear. ♫

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
♫ If I could be anywhere, ♫

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
♫ if I could be anywhere, ♫

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
♫ if I could be anywhere right now, ♫

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
♫ I would want to be here. ♫

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
♫ Searching for the future ♫

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
♫ among the things we're throwing away. ♫

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
♫ Trying to see the world ♫

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000
♫ through the junk we produce everyday. ♫

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
♫ They say nothing lasts forever, ♫

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.000
♫ but all the plastic ever made is still here. ♫

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
♫ And no amount of closing our eyes ♫

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
♫ will make it disappear. ♫

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
♫ If I could be anywhere, ♫

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
♫ if I could be anywhere, ♫

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
♫ if I could be anywhere in history, ♫

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.000
♫ I would want to be here. ♫

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
♫ The Romans, the Spanish ♫

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
♫ the British, the Dutch, ♫

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000
♫ American exceptionalism, so out of touch. ♫

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000
♫ The folly of empire repeating its course, ♫

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
♫ imposing its will ♫

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
♫ and ruling by force ♫

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
♫ on and on through time. ♫

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000
♫ But the world can't take it very much longer. ♫

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
♫ We're not going to make it ♫

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
♫ unless we're smarter and stronger. ♫

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000
♫ The world is going to shake itself free of our greed ♫

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
♫ somehow. ♫

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000
♫ If I could be anywhere, ♫

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.000
♫ if I could be anywhere in time, ♫

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000
♫ if I could be anywhere and change things, ♫

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.000
♫ it would have to be now. ♫

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000
♫ They say nothing last forever, ♫

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.000
♫ but all the plastic ever made is still here. ♫

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
♫ And no amount of closing our eyes ♫

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000
♫ will make it disappear. ♫

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000
♫ And the world can't take it ♫

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
♫ very much longer. ♫

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
♫ We're not going to make it ♫

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000
♫ unless we're smarter and stronger. ♫

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.000
♫ The world's gonna shake itself free of our greed ♫

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000
♫ somehow. ♫

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.000
♫ And the world can't take it, that you can see. ♫

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:29.000
♫ If the oceans don't make it, neither will we. ♫

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.000
♫ The world's gonna shake itself all the way free ♫

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000
♫ somehow. ♫

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000
♫ If I could be anywhere, ♫

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.000
♫ if I could be anywhere in time, ♫

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:49.000
♫ if I could be anywhere and change the outcome, ♫

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.000
♫ it would have to be now. ♫

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
(Applause)

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
Thank you.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:05.000
