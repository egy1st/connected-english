00:00:00.849 --> 00:00:03.000
First, a video.

00:00:09.397 --> 00:00:12.199
Yes, it is a scrambled egg.

00:00:14.151 --> 00:00:15.484
But as you look at it,

00:00:15.508 --> 00:00:19.619
I hope you'll begin to feel
just slightly uneasy.

00:00:21.389 --> 00:00:24.727
Because you may notice
that what's actually happening

00:00:24.751 --> 00:00:26.976
is that the egg is unscrambling itself.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.699
And you'll now see the yolk
and the white have separated.

00:00:29.723 --> 00:00:32.746
And now they're going to be
poured back into the egg.

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:35.238
And we all know in our heart of hearts

00:00:35.262 --> 00:00:38.277
that this is not the way
the universe works.

00:00:39.436 --> 00:00:42.541
A scrambled egg is mush --
tasty mush -- but it's mush.

00:00:42.565 --> 00:00:44.976
An egg is a beautiful, sophisticated thing

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.239
that can create even more
sophisticated things,

00:00:47.263 --> 00:00:48.580
such as chickens.

00:00:49.072 --> 00:00:50.976
And we know in our heart of hearts

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.764
that the universe does not travel
from mush to complexity.

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:57.585
In fact, this gut instinct

00:00:57.609 --> 00:01:00.481
is reflected in one of the most
fundamental laws of physics,

00:01:00.505 --> 00:01:03.330
the second law of thermodynamics,
or the law of entropy.

00:01:03.902 --> 00:01:05.661
What that says basically

00:01:05.685 --> 00:01:08.812
is that the general
tendency of the universe

00:01:08.836 --> 00:01:12.439
is to move from order and structure

00:01:12.463 --> 00:01:15.127
to lack of order, lack of structure --

00:01:15.151 --> 00:01:16.615
in fact, to mush.

00:01:16.639 --> 00:01:19.862
And that's why that video
feels a bit strange.

00:01:20.425 --> 00:01:23.154
And yet, look around us.

00:01:24.194 --> 00:01:27.670
What we see around us
is staggering complexity.

00:01:28.289 --> 00:01:31.578
Eric Beinhocker estimates
that in New York City alone,

00:01:31.602 --> 00:01:35.156
there are some 10 billion SKUs,
or distinct commodities, being traded.

00:01:35.672 --> 00:01:39.640
That's hundreds of times
as many species as there are on Earth.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.976
And they're being traded by a species
of almost seven billion individuals,

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.385
who are linked by trade,
travel, and the Internet

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:51.098
into a global system
of stupendous complexity.

00:01:52.566 --> 00:01:54.042
So here's a great puzzle:

00:01:54.931 --> 00:01:59.578
in a universe ruled
by the second law of thermodynamics,

00:01:59.602 --> 00:02:01.406
how is it possible

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:03.976
to generate the sort
of complexity I've described,

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.788
the sort of complexity
represented by you and me

00:02:07.812 --> 00:02:09.501
and the convention center?

00:02:10.859 --> 00:02:12.812
Well, the answer seems to be,

00:02:12.836 --> 00:02:15.976
the universe can create complexity,

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.555
but with great difficulty.

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:19.707
In pockets,

00:02:19.731 --> 00:02:22.048
there appear
what my colleague, Fred Spier,

00:02:22.072 --> 00:02:24.214
calls "Goldilocks conditions" --

00:02:24.238 --> 00:02:26.289
not too hot, not too cold,

00:02:26.313 --> 00:02:28.976
just right for the creation of complexity.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.267
And slightly more complex things appear.

00:02:31.291 --> 00:02:33.530
And where you have
slightly more complex things,

00:02:33.554 --> 00:02:35.926
you can get slightly more complex things.

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:39.976
And in this way, complexity
builds stage by stage.

00:02:40.875 --> 00:02:43.153
Each stage is magical

00:02:43.177 --> 00:02:46.750
because it creates the impression
of something utterly new

00:02:46.774 --> 00:02:49.577
appearing almost out of nowhere
in the universe.

00:02:49.601 --> 00:02:52.832
We refer in big history to these moments
as threshold moments.

00:02:53.871 --> 00:02:56.976
And at each threshold,
the going gets tougher.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.242
The complex things get more fragile,

00:03:00.266 --> 00:03:01.976
more vulnerable;

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.531
the Goldilocks conditions
get more stringent,

00:03:05.555 --> 00:03:08.542
and it's more difficult
to create complexity.

00:03:09.468 --> 00:03:12.772
Now, we, as extremely complex creatures,

00:03:12.796 --> 00:03:14.976
desperately need to know this story

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.658
of how the universe creates complexity
despite the second law,

00:03:19.682 --> 00:03:24.714
and why complexity means
vulnerability and fragility.

00:03:25.485 --> 00:03:28.405
And that's the story
that we tell in big history.

00:03:28.429 --> 00:03:30.136
But to do it, you have do something

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:32.865
that may, at first sight,
seem completely impossible.

00:03:32.889 --> 00:03:36.069
You have to survey the whole
history of the universe.

00:03:37.488 --> 00:03:38.488
So let's do it.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:40.909
(Laughter)

00:03:40.933 --> 00:03:44.379
Let's begin by winding the timeline back

00:03:44.403 --> 00:03:47.299
13.7 billion years,

00:03:47.323 --> 00:03:50.000
to the beginning of time.

00:03:57.321 --> 00:03:58.975
Around us, there's nothing.

00:03:59.726 --> 00:04:02.432
There's not even time or space.

00:04:03.214 --> 00:04:06.912
Imagine the darkest,
emptiest thing you can

00:04:06.936 --> 00:04:10.253
and cube it a gazillion times
and that's where we are.

00:04:10.732 --> 00:04:13.072
And then suddenly,

00:04:13.096 --> 00:04:14.104
bang!

00:04:14.128 --> 00:04:16.335
A universe appears, an entire universe.

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:18.215
And we've crossed our first threshold.

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:20.612
The universe is tiny;
it's smaller than an atom.

00:04:20.636 --> 00:04:21.976
It's incredibly hot.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.525
It contains everything
that's in today's universe,

00:04:24.549 --> 00:04:26.343
so you can imagine, it's busting.

00:04:26.367 --> 00:04:28.976
And it's expanding at incredible speed.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:30.913
And at first, it's just a blur,

00:04:30.937 --> 00:04:34.047
but very quickly distinct things
begin to appear in that blur.

00:04:34.483 --> 00:04:35.976
Within the first second,

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.976
energy itself shatters
into distinct forces

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.082
including electromagnetism and gravity.

00:04:42.106 --> 00:04:44.534
And energy does something
else quite magical:

00:04:44.558 --> 00:04:47.790
it congeals to form matter --

00:04:47.814 --> 00:04:50.144
quarks that will create protons

00:04:50.168 --> 00:04:52.306
and leptons that include electrons.

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:54.433
And all of that happens
in the first second.

00:04:54.457 --> 00:04:58.686
Now we move forward 380,000 years.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.647
That's twice as long as humans
have been on this planet.

00:05:02.671 --> 00:05:07.411
And now simple atoms appear
of hydrogen and helium.

00:05:08.617 --> 00:05:10.220
Now I want to pause for a moment,

00:05:10.244 --> 00:05:12.976
380,000 years after the origins
of the universe,

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.976
because we actually know quite a lot
about the universe at this stage.

00:05:17.513 --> 00:05:20.434
We know above all
that it was extremely simple.

00:05:20.458 --> 00:05:24.257
It consisted of huge clouds
of hydrogen and helium atoms,

00:05:24.281 --> 00:05:26.209
and they have no structure.

00:05:26.233 --> 00:05:28.600
They're really a sort of cosmic mush.

00:05:29.392 --> 00:05:31.062
But that's not completely true.

00:05:31.472 --> 00:05:32.976
Recent studies

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.861
by satellites such as the WMAP satellite

00:05:35.885 --> 00:05:37.462
have shown that, in fact,

00:05:37.486 --> 00:05:40.235
there are just tiny differences
in that background.

00:05:40.259 --> 00:05:41.976
What you see here,

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:46.306
the blue areas are about a thousandth
of a degree cooler

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:47.722
than the red areas.

00:05:47.746 --> 00:05:49.119
These are tiny differences,

00:05:49.143 --> 00:05:51.413
but it was enough
for the universe to move on

00:05:51.437 --> 00:05:53.412
to the next stage of building complexity.

00:05:53.436 --> 00:05:54.628
And this is how it works.

00:05:55.635 --> 00:05:59.883
Gravity is more powerful
where there's more stuff.

00:06:00.557 --> 00:06:02.875
So where you get slightly denser areas,

00:06:02.899 --> 00:06:06.816
gravity starts compacting clouds
of hydrogen and helium atoms.

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:10.390
So we can imagine the early universe
breaking up into a billion clouds.

00:06:10.414 --> 00:06:12.216
And each cloud is compacted,

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:15.256
gravity gets more powerful
as density increases,

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:18.374
the temperature begins to rise
at the center of each cloud,

00:06:18.398 --> 00:06:19.687
and then, at the center,

00:06:19.711 --> 00:06:22.549
the temperature crosses
the threshold temperature

00:06:22.573 --> 00:06:24.139
of 10 million degrees,

00:06:24.163 --> 00:06:26.568
protons start to fuse,

00:06:26.592 --> 00:06:28.976
there's a huge release of energy,

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:30.433
and --

00:06:30.457 --> 00:06:31.473
bam!

00:06:31.497 --> 00:06:33.012
We have our first stars.

00:06:33.678 --> 00:06:37.536
From about 200 million years
after the Big Bang,

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:40.967
stars begin to appear
all through the universe,

00:06:40.991 --> 00:06:42.062
billions of them.

00:06:42.499 --> 00:06:45.355
And the universe is now
significantly more interesting

00:06:45.379 --> 00:06:46.474
and more complex.

00:06:47.928 --> 00:06:51.044
Stars will create
the Goldilocks conditions

00:06:51.068 --> 00:06:52.967
for crossing two new thresholds.

00:06:53.371 --> 00:06:55.950
When very large stars die,

00:06:55.974 --> 00:06:58.295
they create temperatures so high

00:06:58.319 --> 00:07:01.952
that protons begin to fuse
in all sorts of exotic combinations,

00:07:01.976 --> 00:07:04.806
to form all the elements
of the periodic table.

00:07:04.830 --> 00:07:07.126
If, like me, you're wearing a gold ring,

00:07:07.150 --> 00:07:09.976
it was forged in a supernova explosion.

00:07:10.618 --> 00:07:13.817
So now the universe
is chemically more complex.

00:07:13.841 --> 00:07:16.206
And in a chemically more complex universe,

00:07:16.230 --> 00:07:18.674
it's possible to make more things.

00:07:18.698 --> 00:07:22.190
And what starts happening
is that, around young suns,

00:07:22.214 --> 00:07:23.976
young stars,

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.191
all these elements combine,
they swirl around,

00:07:26.215 --> 00:07:28.995
the energy of the star stirs them around,

00:07:29.019 --> 00:07:33.744
they form particles, they form snowflakes,
they form little dust motes,

00:07:33.768 --> 00:07:35.964
they form rocks, they form asteroids,

00:07:35.988 --> 00:07:38.583
and eventually,
they form planets and moons.

00:07:38.607 --> 00:07:41.557
And that is how our
solar system was formed,

00:07:41.581 --> 00:07:43.976
four and a half billion years ago.

00:07:45.193 --> 00:07:50.566
Rocky planets like our Earth
are significantly more complex than stars

00:07:50.590 --> 00:07:53.352
because they contain
a much greater diversity of materials.

00:07:53.376 --> 00:07:56.157
So we've crossed a fourth
threshold of complexity.

00:07:57.671 --> 00:08:00.298
Now, the going gets tougher.

00:08:01.151 --> 00:08:05.429
The next stage introduces entities
that are significantly more fragile,

00:08:05.453 --> 00:08:07.365
significantly more vulnerable,

00:08:07.389 --> 00:08:09.976
but they're also much more creative

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.976
and much more capable
of generating further complexity.

00:08:13.346 --> 00:08:16.770
I'm talking, of course,
about living organisms.

00:08:17.474 --> 00:08:19.617
Living organisms are created by chemistry.

00:08:19.641 --> 00:08:22.024
We are huge packages of chemicals.

00:08:22.855 --> 00:08:25.976
So, chemistry is dominated
by the electromagnetic force.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.239
That operates over smaller
scales than gravity,

00:08:28.263 --> 00:08:32.178
which explains why you and I
are smaller than stars or planets.

00:08:32.773 --> 00:08:35.067
Now, what are the ideal
conditions for chemistry?

00:08:35.614 --> 00:08:37.384
What are the Goldilocks conditions?

00:08:37.408 --> 00:08:39.765
Well, first, you need energy,

00:08:39.789 --> 00:08:40.976
but not too much.

00:08:41.405 --> 00:08:43.660
In the center of a star,
there's so much energy

00:08:43.684 --> 00:08:46.826
that any atoms that combine
will just get busted apart again.

00:08:46.850 --> 00:08:47.976
But not too little.

00:08:48.382 --> 00:08:49.613
In intergalactic space,

00:08:49.637 --> 00:08:52.520
there's so little energy
that atoms can't combine.

00:08:53.118 --> 00:08:54.976
What you want is just the right amount,

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.000
and planets, it turns out, are just right,

00:08:57.024 --> 00:08:59.531
because they're close to stars,
but not too close.

00:09:00.134 --> 00:09:03.729
You also need a great diversity
of chemical elements,

00:09:03.753 --> 00:09:06.761
and you need liquids, such as water.

00:09:06.785 --> 00:09:07.832
Why?

00:09:07.856 --> 00:09:11.728
Well, in gases, atoms move
past each other so fast

00:09:11.752 --> 00:09:13.205
that they can't hitch up.

00:09:13.690 --> 00:09:15.412
In solids,

00:09:15.436 --> 00:09:17.976
atoms are stuck together, they can't move.

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:19.718
In liquids,

00:09:19.742 --> 00:09:22.780
they can cruise and cuddle

00:09:22.804 --> 00:09:25.106
and link up to form molecules.

00:09:25.780 --> 00:09:28.135
Now, where do you find
such Goldilocks conditions?

00:09:28.674 --> 00:09:30.666
Well, planets are great,

00:09:30.690 --> 00:09:33.976
and our early Earth was almost perfect.

00:09:34.777 --> 00:09:36.825
It was just the right
distance from its star

00:09:36.849 --> 00:09:38.976
to contain huge oceans of liquid water.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:40.976
And deep beneath those oceans,

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:42.976
at cracks in the Earth's crust,

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.976
you've got heat seeping up
from inside the Earth,

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.127
and you've got a great
diversity of elements.

00:09:48.151 --> 00:09:50.697
So at those deep oceanic vents,

00:09:50.721 --> 00:09:52.976
fantastic chemistry began to happen,

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:56.000
and atoms combined in all sorts
of exotic combinations.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:01.365
But of course, life is more
than just exotic chemistry.

00:10:01.794 --> 00:10:05.551
How do you stabilize those huge molecules

00:10:05.575 --> 00:10:06.932
that seem to be viable?

00:10:07.690 --> 00:10:12.046
Well, it's here that life introduces
an entirely new trick.

00:10:12.960 --> 00:10:15.495
You don't stabilize the individual;

00:10:15.519 --> 00:10:17.622
you stabilize the template,

00:10:17.646 --> 00:10:19.751
the thing that carries information,

00:10:19.775 --> 00:10:21.992
and you allow the template to copy itself.

00:10:22.016 --> 00:10:25.167
And DNA, of course,
is the beautiful molecule

00:10:25.191 --> 00:10:27.517
that contains that information.

00:10:27.541 --> 00:10:30.356
You'll be familiar
with the double helix of DNA.

00:10:30.380 --> 00:10:32.896
Each rung contains information.

00:10:32.920 --> 00:10:37.493
So, DNA contains information
about how to make living organisms.

00:10:38.055 --> 00:10:39.979
And DNA also copies itself.

00:10:40.003 --> 00:10:41.209
So, it copies itself

00:10:41.233 --> 00:10:43.915
and scatters the templates
through the ocean.

00:10:43.939 --> 00:10:45.733
So the information spreads.

00:10:45.757 --> 00:10:48.395
Notice that information
has become part of our story.

00:10:48.877 --> 00:10:52.522
The real beauty of DNA though
is in its imperfections.

00:10:52.546 --> 00:10:56.474
As it copies itself,
once in every billion rungs,

00:10:56.498 --> 00:10:58.243
there tends to be an error.

00:10:58.267 --> 00:11:02.976
And what that means
is that DNA is, in effect, learning.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:06.320
It's accumulating new ways
of making living organisms

00:11:06.344 --> 00:11:07.964
because some of those errors work.

00:11:07.988 --> 00:11:09.186
So DNA's learning

00:11:09.210 --> 00:11:12.444
and it's building greater
diversity and greater complexity.

00:11:12.468 --> 00:11:15.650
And we can see this happening
over the last four billion years.

00:11:15.674 --> 00:11:17.849
For most of that time of life on Earth,

00:11:17.873 --> 00:11:20.110
living organisms have been
relatively simple --

00:11:20.134 --> 00:11:21.522
single cells.

00:11:21.546 --> 00:11:24.976
But they had great diversity,
and, inside, great complexity.

00:11:25.411 --> 00:11:28.315
Then from about 600
to 800 million years ago,

00:11:28.339 --> 00:11:30.430
multi-celled organisms appear.

00:11:30.454 --> 00:11:32.955
You get fungi, you get fish,

00:11:32.979 --> 00:11:34.494
you get plants,

00:11:34.518 --> 00:11:37.229
you get amphibia, you get reptiles,

00:11:37.253 --> 00:11:39.683
and then, of course,
you get the dinosaurs.

00:11:40.739 --> 00:11:43.248
And occasionally, there are disasters.

00:11:44.326 --> 00:11:46.715
Sixty-five million years ago,

00:11:46.739 --> 00:11:48.703
an asteroid landed on Earth

00:11:48.727 --> 00:11:50.517
near the Yucatan Peninsula,

00:11:50.541 --> 00:11:53.509
creating conditions equivalent
to those of a nuclear war,

00:11:53.533 --> 00:11:55.422
and the dinosaurs were wiped out.

00:11:55.906 --> 00:11:58.976
Terrible news for the dinosaurs,

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:02.755
but great news
for our mammalian ancestors,

00:12:02.779 --> 00:12:03.976
who flourished

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:07.657
in the niches left empty by the dinosaurs.

00:12:07.681 --> 00:12:12.736
And we human beings are part
of that creative evolutionary pulse

00:12:12.760 --> 00:12:15.096
that began 65 million years ago

00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:17.000
with the landing of an asteroid.

00:12:18.536 --> 00:12:21.250
Humans appeared about 200,000 years ago.

00:12:21.274 --> 00:12:25.622
And I believe we count
as a threshold in this great story.

00:12:25.646 --> 00:12:26.853
Let me explain why.

00:12:27.440 --> 00:12:30.471
We've seen that DNA learns in a sense,

00:12:30.495 --> 00:12:32.282
it accumulates information.

00:12:32.306 --> 00:12:33.976
But it is so slow.

00:12:34.868 --> 00:12:38.340
DNA accumulates information
through random errors,

00:12:38.364 --> 00:12:40.500
some of which just happen to work.

00:12:41.230 --> 00:12:43.864
But DNA had actually generated
a faster way of learning:

00:12:43.888 --> 00:12:46.666
it had produced organisms with brains,

00:12:46.690 --> 00:12:49.909
and those organisms
can learn in real time.

00:12:49.933 --> 00:12:52.259
They accumulate information, they learn.

00:12:52.283 --> 00:12:55.108
The sad thing is, when they die,

00:12:55.132 --> 00:12:56.830
the information dies with them.

00:12:57.219 --> 00:13:01.206
Now what makes humans different
is human language.

00:13:01.230 --> 00:13:03.993
We are blessed with a language,
a system of communication,

00:13:04.017 --> 00:13:06.638
so powerful and so precise

00:13:06.662 --> 00:13:09.820
that we can share what we've learned
with such precision

00:13:09.844 --> 00:13:12.733
that it can accumulate
in the collective memory.

00:13:12.757 --> 00:13:13.976
And that means

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:17.779
it can outlast the individuals
who learned that information,

00:13:17.803 --> 00:13:20.976
and it can accumulate
from generation to generation.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:25.056
And that's why, as a species,
we're so creative and so powerful,

00:13:25.080 --> 00:13:27.136
and that's why we have a history.

00:13:27.755 --> 00:13:31.056
We seem to be the only species
in four billion years

00:13:31.080 --> 00:13:32.322
to have this gift.

00:13:32.797 --> 00:13:36.362
I call this ability collective learning.

00:13:36.735 --> 00:13:38.124
It's what makes us different.

00:13:38.426 --> 00:13:41.976
We can see it at work
in the earliest stages of human history.

00:13:42.689 --> 00:13:45.976
We evolved as a species
in the savanna lands of Africa,

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:49.460
but then you see humans migrating
into new environments,

00:13:49.484 --> 00:13:51.634
into desert lands, into jungles,

00:13:51.658 --> 00:13:54.094
into the Ice Age tundra of Siberia --

00:13:54.118 --> 00:13:55.563
tough, tough environment --

00:13:55.587 --> 00:13:57.920
into the Americas, into Australasia.

00:13:57.944 --> 00:13:59.981
Each migration involved learning --

00:14:00.005 --> 00:14:02.488
learning new ways of exploiting
the environment,

00:14:02.512 --> 00:14:04.686
new ways of dealing
with their surroundings.

00:14:04.710 --> 00:14:06.526
Then 10,000 years ago,

00:14:06.550 --> 00:14:09.545
exploiting a sudden
change in global climate

00:14:09.569 --> 00:14:11.141
with the end of the last ice age,

00:14:11.165 --> 00:14:12.746
humans learned to farm.

00:14:13.363 --> 00:14:15.799
Farming was an energy bonanza.

00:14:15.823 --> 00:14:19.650
And exploiting that energy,
human populations multiplied.

00:14:19.674 --> 00:14:23.261
Human societies got larger,
denser, more interconnected.

00:14:23.841 --> 00:14:27.192
And then from about 500 years ago,

00:14:27.216 --> 00:14:29.255
humans began to link up globally

00:14:29.279 --> 00:14:31.660
through shipping, through trains,

00:14:31.684 --> 00:14:33.976
through telegraph, through the Internet,

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:39.191
until now we seem to form
a single global brain

00:14:39.215 --> 00:14:41.347
of almost seven billion individuals.

00:14:41.371 --> 00:14:44.533
And that brain is learning at warp speed.

00:14:45.312 --> 00:14:47.884
And in the last 200 years,
something else has happened.

00:14:47.908 --> 00:14:50.574
We've stumbled on another energy bonanza

00:14:50.598 --> 00:14:51.725
in fossil fuels.

00:14:51.749 --> 00:14:54.452
So fossil fuels and collective
learning together

00:14:54.476 --> 00:14:58.000
explain the staggering complexity
we see around us.

00:15:01.245 --> 00:15:02.245
So --

00:15:03.408 --> 00:15:04.725
Here we are,

00:15:04.749 --> 00:15:06.273
back at the convention center.

00:15:06.297 --> 00:15:11.003
We've been on a journey,
a return journey, of 13.7 billion years.

00:15:11.707 --> 00:15:14.176
I hope you agree this is a powerful story.

00:15:14.200 --> 00:15:18.865
And it's a story in which humans
play an astonishing and creative role.

00:15:19.206 --> 00:15:21.421
But it also contains warnings.

00:15:22.214 --> 00:15:26.547
Collective learning is a very,
very powerful force,

00:15:26.571 --> 00:15:30.976
and it's not clear
that we humans are in charge of it.

00:15:31.863 --> 00:15:34.932
I remember very vividly
as a child growing up in England,

00:15:34.956 --> 00:15:36.976
living through the Cuban Missile Crisis.

00:15:37.587 --> 00:15:41.198
For a few days, the entire biosphere

00:15:41.222 --> 00:15:43.521
seemed to be on the verge of destruction.

00:15:44.214 --> 00:15:47.379
And the same weapons are still here,

00:15:47.403 --> 00:15:48.976
and they are still armed.

00:15:49.744 --> 00:15:52.976
If we avoid that trap,
others are waiting for us.

00:15:53.387 --> 00:15:55.976
We're burning fossil fuels at such a rate

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:59.411
that we seem to be undermining
the Goldilocks conditions

00:15:59.435 --> 00:16:01.663
that made it possible
for human civilizations

00:16:01.687 --> 00:16:04.769
to flourish over the last 10,000 years.

00:16:05.373 --> 00:16:07.649
So what big history can do

00:16:07.673 --> 00:16:10.994
is show us the nature
of our complexity and fragility

00:16:11.018 --> 00:16:12.942
and the dangers that face us,

00:16:12.966 --> 00:16:16.546
but it can also show us
our power with collective learning.

00:16:17.326 --> 00:16:19.278
And now, finally --

00:16:20.397 --> 00:16:22.552
this is what I want.

00:16:24.188 --> 00:16:27.220
I want my grandson, Daniel,

00:16:27.244 --> 00:16:30.001
and his friends and his generation,

00:16:30.025 --> 00:16:31.818
throughout the world,

00:16:31.842 --> 00:16:34.682
to know the story of big history,

00:16:34.706 --> 00:16:36.745
and to know it so well

00:16:36.769 --> 00:16:40.435
that they understand
both the challenges that face us

00:16:40.459 --> 00:16:42.976
and the opportunities that face us.

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:44.880
And that's why a group of us

00:16:44.904 --> 00:16:47.916
are building a free, online syllabus

00:16:47.940 --> 00:16:49.258
in big history

00:16:49.282 --> 00:16:51.433
for high-school students
throughout the world.

00:16:51.965 --> 00:16:54.401
We believe that big history

00:16:54.425 --> 00:16:56.976
will be a vital
intellectual tool for them,

00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:59.843
as Daniel and his generation

00:16:59.867 --> 00:17:02.215
face the huge challenges

00:17:02.239 --> 00:17:04.294
and also the huge opportunities

00:17:04.318 --> 00:17:07.773
ahead of them at this threshold moment

00:17:07.797 --> 00:17:10.976
in the history of our beautiful planet.

00:17:11.733 --> 00:17:13.281
I thank you for your attention.

00:17:13.305 --> 00:17:18.000
(Applause)
