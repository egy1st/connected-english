00:00:00.634 --> 00:00:04.103
How often do we hear
that people just don't care?

00:00:04.958 --> 00:00:06.549
How many times have you been told

00:00:06.573 --> 00:00:09.814
that real, substantial change
isn't possible

00:00:09.838 --> 00:00:11.913
because most people are too selfish,

00:00:11.937 --> 00:00:13.869
too stupid or too lazy

00:00:13.893 --> 00:00:16.525
to try to make a difference
in their community?

00:00:16.549 --> 00:00:19.643
I propose to you today
that apathy as we think we know it

00:00:19.667 --> 00:00:21.378
doesn't actually exist;

00:00:21.402 --> 00:00:23.576
but rather, that people do care,

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:27.309
but that we live in a world
that actively discourages engagement

00:00:27.333 --> 00:00:30.694
by constantly putting obstacles
and barriers in our way.

00:00:30.718 --> 00:00:32.750
I'll give you some
examples of what I mean.

00:00:32.774 --> 00:00:34.487
Let's start with city hall.

00:00:34.863 --> 00:00:36.576
You ever see one of these before?

00:00:36.958 --> 00:00:38.576
This is a newspaper ad.

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:41.968
It's a notice of a zoning application
change for a new office building

00:00:41.992 --> 00:00:44.063
so the neighborhood
knows what's happening.

00:00:44.087 --> 00:00:46.009
As you can see, it's impossible to read.

00:00:46.033 --> 00:00:47.409
You need to get halfway down

00:00:47.433 --> 00:00:49.967
to even find out which address
they're talking about,

00:00:49.991 --> 00:00:52.135
and then further down,
in tiny 10-point font,

00:00:52.159 --> 00:00:54.195
to find out how to actually get involved.

00:00:54.219 --> 00:00:57.346
Imagine if the private sector
advertised in the same way --

00:00:57.370 --> 00:00:59.412
if Nike wanted to sell a pair of shoes --

00:00:59.436 --> 00:01:00.576
(Laughter)

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.565
And put an ad in the paper like that.

00:01:02.589 --> 00:01:06.576
(Applause)

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.576
Now, that would never happen.

00:01:09.435 --> 00:01:11.014
You'll never see an ad like that,

00:01:11.038 --> 00:01:13.469
because Nike actually wants
you to buy their shoes,

00:01:13.493 --> 00:01:16.374
whereas the city of Toronto
clearly doesn't want you involved

00:01:16.398 --> 00:01:17.650
with the planning process,

00:01:17.674 --> 00:01:20.090
otherwise their ads would look
something like this,

00:01:20.114 --> 00:01:22.131
with all the information laid out clearly.

00:01:22.155 --> 00:01:24.572
As long as the city's putting out
notices like this

00:01:24.596 --> 00:01:26.022
to try to get people engaged,

00:01:26.046 --> 00:01:28.380
then of course people
aren't going to be engaged.

00:01:28.404 --> 00:01:30.992
But that's not apathy;
that's intentional exclusion.

00:01:32.324 --> 00:01:33.588
Public space.

00:01:33.612 --> 00:01:36.400
(Applause)

00:01:36.521 --> 00:01:38.856
The manner in which we mistreat
our public spaces

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:43.140
is a huge obstacle towards any type
of progressive political change,

00:01:43.164 --> 00:01:46.363
because we've essentially put a price tag
on freedom of expression.

00:01:46.387 --> 00:01:48.972
Whoever has the most money
gets the loudest voice,

00:01:48.996 --> 00:01:51.395
dominating the visual
and mental environment.

00:01:51.419 --> 00:01:54.399
The problem with this model
is there are some amazing messages

00:01:54.423 --> 00:01:57.264
that need to be said,
that aren't profitable to say.

00:01:57.288 --> 00:01:59.790
So you're never going
to see them on a billboard.

00:02:00.755 --> 00:02:02.368
The media plays an important role

00:02:02.392 --> 00:02:05.576
in developing our relationship
with political change,

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:09.751
mainly by ignoring politics and focusing
on celebrities and scandals,

00:02:09.775 --> 00:02:12.628
but even when they do talk
about important political issues,

00:02:12.652 --> 00:02:15.505
they do it in a way that I feel
discourages engagement.

00:02:15.529 --> 00:02:16.747
I'll give you an example.

00:02:16.771 --> 00:02:20.364
The "Now" magazine from last week:
progressive, downtown weekly in Toronto.

00:02:20.388 --> 00:02:21.576
This is the cover story.

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:24.088
It's an article
about a theater performance,

00:02:24.112 --> 00:02:26.870
and it starts with basic
information about where it is,

00:02:26.894 --> 00:02:30.419
in case you actually want to go and see
it after you've read the article --

00:02:30.443 --> 00:02:32.226
where, the time, the website.

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:34.655
Same with this -- it's a movie review.

00:02:34.679 --> 00:02:36.263
An art review.

00:02:36.287 --> 00:02:39.425
A book review -- where the reading
is in case you want to go.

00:02:39.449 --> 00:02:42.159
A restaurant -- you might not
want to just read about it,

00:02:42.183 --> 00:02:43.610
maybe you want to go there.

00:02:43.634 --> 00:02:47.407
So they tell you where it is, the prices,
the address, the phone number, etc.

00:02:47.431 --> 00:02:49.408
Then you get to their political articles.

00:02:49.432 --> 00:02:52.892
Here's a great article about an important
election race that's happening.

00:02:52.916 --> 00:02:55.245
It talks about the candidates,
written very well,

00:02:55.269 --> 00:02:58.496
but no information, no follow-up,
no websites for the campaigns,

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:02.045
no information about when the debates
are, where the campaign offices are.

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:03.498
Here's another good article,

00:03:03.522 --> 00:03:06.576
about a new campaign
opposing privatization of transit,

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:09.314
without any contact information
for the campaign.

00:03:09.338 --> 00:03:10.862
The message seems to be

00:03:10.886 --> 00:03:14.297
that the readers are most likely
to want to eat, maybe read a book,

00:03:14.321 --> 00:03:17.084
maybe see a movie, but not be engaged
in their community.

00:03:17.108 --> 00:03:20.246
You might think this is a small thing,
but I think it's important,

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:21.666
because it sets a tone

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:27.319
and it reinforces the dangerous idea
that politics is a spectator sport.

00:03:28.163 --> 00:03:30.408
Heroes: How do we view leadership?

00:03:30.432 --> 00:03:33.095
Look at these 10 movies.
What do they have in common?

00:03:33.119 --> 00:03:34.284
Anyone?

00:03:36.038 --> 00:03:38.112
They all have heroes who were chosen.

00:03:38.136 --> 00:03:40.851
Someone came up to them and said,
"You're the chosen one.

00:03:40.875 --> 00:03:43.149
There's a prophecy.
You have to save the world."

00:03:43.173 --> 00:03:46.475
And then they go off and save the world
because they've been told to,

00:03:46.499 --> 00:03:48.058
with a few people tagging along.

00:03:48.082 --> 00:03:49.238
This helps me understand

00:03:49.262 --> 00:03:52.289
why a lot of people have trouble
seeing themselves as leaders --

00:03:52.313 --> 00:03:55.837
because it sends all the wrong messages
about what leadership is about.

00:03:55.861 --> 00:03:58.374
A heroic effort is a collective effort,

00:03:58.398 --> 00:03:59.576
number one.

00:03:59.928 --> 00:04:03.296
Number two, it's imperfect;
it's not very glamorous,

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:05.502
and doesn't suddenly start
and suddenly end.

00:04:05.526 --> 00:04:07.588
It's an ongoing process your whole life.

00:04:07.612 --> 00:04:09.389
But most importantly, it's voluntary.

00:04:09.413 --> 00:04:10.831
It's voluntary.

00:04:10.855 --> 00:04:13.218
As long as we're teaching our kids

00:04:13.242 --> 00:04:16.664
that heroism starts when someone
scratches a mark on your forehead,

00:04:16.688 --> 00:04:18.914
or someone tells you
you're part of a prophecy,

00:04:18.938 --> 00:04:21.967
they're missing the most important
characteristic of leadership,

00:04:21.991 --> 00:04:23.678
which is that it comes from within.

00:04:23.702 --> 00:04:27.576
It's about following
your own dreams, uninvited,

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:30.576
and then working with others
to make those dreams come true.

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:32.576
Political parties: oh, boy.

00:04:32.999 --> 00:04:37.492
Political parties could and should be
one of the basic entry points

00:04:37.516 --> 00:04:39.443
for people to get engaged in politics.

00:04:39.467 --> 00:04:41.732
Instead, they've become, sadly,

00:04:41.756 --> 00:04:44.642
uninspiring and uncreative organizations

00:04:44.666 --> 00:04:48.576
that rely so heavily on market research
and polling and focus groups

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:50.648
that they end up all saying
the same thing,

00:04:50.672 --> 00:04:53.768
pretty much regurgitating back
to us what we already want to hear

00:04:53.792 --> 00:04:56.576
at the expense of putting forward
bold and creative ideas.

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:59.356
And people can smell that,
and it feeds cynicism.

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:05.356
(Applause)

00:05:05.724 --> 00:05:07.168
Charitable status.

00:05:07.192 --> 00:05:10.946
Groups who have charitable status
in Canada aren't allowed to do advocacy.

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:13.501
This is a huge problem
and a huge obstacle to change,

00:05:13.525 --> 00:05:16.997
because it means that some
of the most passionate and informed voices

00:05:17.021 --> 00:05:19.904
are completely silenced,
especially during election time.

00:05:19.928 --> 00:05:23.291
Which leads us to the last one,
which is: our elections.

00:05:23.696 --> 00:05:24.864
As you may have noticed,

00:05:24.888 --> 00:05:26.995
our elections in Canada
are a complete joke.

00:05:27.019 --> 00:05:28.510
We use out-of-date systems

00:05:28.534 --> 00:05:30.835
that are unfair and create random results.

00:05:30.859 --> 00:05:32.576
Canada's currently led by a party

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:35.048
that most Canadians didn't actually want.

00:05:35.072 --> 00:05:38.687
How can we honestly and genuinely
encourage more people to vote

00:05:38.711 --> 00:05:40.988
when votes don't count in Canada?

00:05:41.012 --> 00:05:44.380
You add all this up together,
and of course people are apathetic.

00:05:44.404 --> 00:05:46.464
It's like trying to run into a brick wall.

00:05:46.488 --> 00:05:49.805
Now, I'm not trying to be negative
by throwing all these obstacles out

00:05:49.829 --> 00:05:51.429
and explaining what's in our way.

00:05:51.453 --> 00:05:52.606
Quite the opposite --

00:05:52.630 --> 00:05:57.114
I actually think people are amazing
and smart and that they do care,

00:05:57.217 --> 00:05:59.576
but that, as I said,
we live in this environment

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:02.738
where all these obstacles
are being put in our way.

00:06:03.488 --> 00:06:06.939
As long as we believe
that people, our own neighbors,

00:06:06.963 --> 00:06:09.659
are selfish, stupid or lazy,

00:06:10.417 --> 00:06:11.709
then there's no hope.

00:06:12.804 --> 00:06:15.115
But we can change
all those things I mentioned.

00:06:15.139 --> 00:06:16.576
We can open up city hall.

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:18.332
We can reform our electoral systems.

00:06:18.356 --> 00:06:20.333
We can democratize our public spaces.

00:06:20.357 --> 00:06:22.129
My main message is:

00:06:22.153 --> 00:06:23.831
if we can redefine apathy,

00:06:23.855 --> 00:06:25.877
not as some kind of internal syndrome,

00:06:25.901 --> 00:06:30.695
but as a complex web of cultural barriers
that reinforces disengagement,

00:06:31.329 --> 00:06:36.892
and if we can clearly define,
clearly identify what those obstacles are,

00:06:36.916 --> 00:06:40.507
and then if we can work together
collectively to dismantle those obstacles,

00:06:40.531 --> 00:06:41.785
then anything is possible.

00:06:41.809 --> 00:06:42.969
Thank you.

00:06:42.993 --> 00:06:44.993
(Applause)
