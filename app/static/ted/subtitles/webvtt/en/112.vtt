WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
I am a vicar in the Church of England.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:07.000
I've been a priest in the Church for 20 years.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
For most of that time, I've been struggling and grappling

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.000
with questions about the nature of God. Who is God?

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.000
And I'm very aware that when you say the word "God,"

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
many people will turn off immediately.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.000
And most people, both within and outside the organized church,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:37.000
still have a picture of a celestial controller,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:43.000
a rule maker, a policeman in the sky who orders everything,

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
and causes everything to happen.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
He will protect his own people,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
and answer the prayers of the faithful.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
And in the worship of my church,

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.000
the most frequently used adjective about God is "almighty."

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
But I have a problem with that.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
I have become more and more uncomfortable

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000
with this perception of God over the years.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:20.000
Do we really believe that God is the kind of male boss that we've been presenting

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
in our worship and in our liturgies over all these years?

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
Of course, there have been thinkers

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.000
who have suggested different ways of looking at God.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:37.000
Exploring the feminine, nurturing side of divinity.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:44.000
Suggesting that God expresses Himself or Herself through powerlessness,

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
rather than power.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.000
Acknowledging that God is unknown and unknowable by definition.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:02:00.000
Finding deep resonances with other religions and philosophies

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:08.000
and ways of looking at life as part of what is a universal and global search for meaning.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:13.000
These ideas are well known in liberal academic circles,

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:19.000
but clergy like myself have been reluctant to air them,

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:25.000
for fear of creating tension and division in our church communities,

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:31.000
for fear of upsetting the simple faith of more traditional believers.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
I have chosen not to rock the boat.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.000
Then, on December 26th last year, just two months ago,

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:48.000
that underwater earthquake triggered the tsunami.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:53.000
And two weeks later, Sunday morning, 9th of January,

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000
I found myself standing in front of my congregation --

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:02.000
intelligent, well meaning, mostly thoughtful Christian people --

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:10.000
and I needed to express, on their behalf, our feelings and our questions.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:17.000
I had my own personal responses, but I also have a public role,

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
and something needed to be said.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.000
And this is what I said.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.000
Shortly after the tsunami I read a newspaper article

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.000
written by the Archbishop of Canterbury -- fine title --

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.000
about the tragedy in Southern Asia.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.000
The essence of what he said was this:

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:45.000
the people most affected by the devastation and loss of life

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:51.000
do not want intellectual theories about how God let this happen.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:57.000
He wrote, "If some religious genius did come up with an explanation

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:03.000
of exactly why all these deaths made sense,

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:08.000
would we feel happier, or safer, or more confident in God?"

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.000
If the man in the photograph that appeared in the newspapers,

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:19.000
holding the hand of his dead child was standing in front of us now,

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:23.000
there are no words that we could say to him.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.000
A verbal response would not be appropriate.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:33.000
The only appropriate response would be a compassionate silence

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000
and some kind of practical help.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:41.000
It isn't a time for explanation, or preaching, or theology;

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000
it's a time for tears.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:51.000
This is true. And yet here we are, my church in Oxford,

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:56.000
semi-detached from events that happened a long way away,

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.000
but with our faith bruised.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.000
And we want an explanation from God.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.000
We demand an explanation from God.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.000
Some have concluded that we can only believe in a God who shares our pain.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:18.000
In some way, God must feel the anguish, and grief,

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000
and physical pain that we feel.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:29.000
In some way the eternal God must be able to enter into the souls of human beings

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:33.000
and experience the torment within.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:39.000
And if this is true, it must also be that God knows the joy and exaltation

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.000
of the human spirit, as well.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.000
We want a God who can weep with those who weep,

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:52.000
and rejoice with those who rejoice.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:58.000
This seems to me both a deeply moving and a convincing re-statement

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000
of Christian belief about God.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:06.000
For hundreds of years, the prevailing orthodoxy, the accepted truth,

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:10.000
was that God the Father, the Creator, is unchanging

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:16.000
and therefore by definition cannot feel pain or sadness.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:20.000
Now the unchanging God feels a bit cold and indifferent to me.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:25.000
And the devastating events of the 20th century

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.000
have forced people to question the cold, unfeeling God.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:35.000
The slaughter of millions in the trenches and in the death camps

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:39.000
have caused people to ask, "Where is God in all this?

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.000
Who is God in all this?"

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:48.000
And the answer was, "God is in this with us,

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:53.000
or God doesn't deserve our allegiance anymore."

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:57.000
If God is a bystander, observing but not involved,

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:02.000
then God may well exist, but we don't want to know about Him.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:07.000
Many Jews and Christians now feel like this, I know.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000
And I am among them.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.000
So we have a suffering God --

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:18.000
a God who is intimately connected with this world and with every living soul.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:22.000
I very much relate to this idea of God.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:27.000
But it isn't enough. I need to ask some more questions,

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.000
and I hope they are questions that you will want to ask, as well,

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000
some of you.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:37.000
Over the last few weeks I have been struck by the number of times

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:41.000
that words in our worship have felt a bit inappropriate, a bit dodgy.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:47.000
We have a pram service on Tuesday mornings for mums and their pre-school children.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:51.000
And last week we sang with the children one of their favorite songs,

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:54.000
"The Wise Man Built His House Upon the Rock."

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.000
Perhaps some of you know it. Some of the words go like this:

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:00.000
"The foolish man built his house upon the sand /

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:06.000
And the floods came up / And the house on the sand went crash."

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:11.000
Then in the same week, at a funeral,

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:16.000
we sang the familiar hymn "We Plow the Fields and Scatter,"

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.000
a very English hymn.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:23.000
In the second verse comes the line, "The wind and waves obey Him."

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:30.000
Do they? I don't feel we can sing that song again in church,

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000
after what's happened.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.000
So the first big question is about control.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:40.000
Does God have a plan for each of us? Is God in control?

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:47.000
Does God order each moment? Does the wind and the waves obey Him?

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000
From time to time,

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:55.000
one hears Christians telling the story of how God organized things for them,

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.000
so that everything worked out all right --

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:02.000
some difficulty overcome, some illness cured, some trouble averted,

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:06.000
a parking space found at a crucial time.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:10.000
I can remember someone saying this to me,

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:16.000
with her eyes shining with enthusiasm at this wonderful confirmation of her faith

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:19.000
and the goodness of God.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.000
But if God can or will do these things --

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:27.000
intervene to change the flow of events --

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:30.000
then surely he could have stopped the tsunami.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:35.000
Do we have a local God who can do little things like parking spaces,

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:39.000
but not big things like 500 mile-per-hour waves?

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:44.000
That's just not acceptable to intelligent Christians,

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.000
and we must acknowledge it.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:49.000
Either God is responsible for the tsunami,

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.000
or God is not in control.

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:56.000
After the tragedy, survival stories began to emerge.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.000
You probably heard some of them:

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.000
the man who surfed the wave,

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.000
the teenage girl who recognized the danger

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:06.000
because she had just been learning about tsunamis at school.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:11.000
Then there was the congregation who had left their usual church building on the shore

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.000
to hold a service in the hills.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:17.000
The preacher delivered an extra long sermon,

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:21.000
so that they were still out of harm's way when the wave struck.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:27.000
Afterwards someone said that God must have been looking after them.

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:32.000
So the next question is about partiality.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:37.000
Can we earn God's favor by worshipping Him or believing in Him?

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:41.000
Does God demand loyalty, like any medieval tyrant?

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:48.000
A God who looks after His own, so that Christians are OK,

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.000
while everyone else perishes?

00:10:50.000 --> 00:11:00.000
A cosmic us and them, and a God who is guilty of the worst kind of favoritism?

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.000
That would be appalling,

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:07.000
and that would be the point at which I would hand in my membership.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:14.000
Such a God would be morally inferior to the highest ideals of humanity.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:21.000
So who is God, if not the great puppet-master or the tribal protector?

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:26.000
Perhaps God allows or permits terrible things to happen,

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:30.000
so that heroism and compassion can be shown.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:34.000
Perhaps God is testing us: testing our charity, or our faith.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:39.000
Perhaps there is a great, cosmic plan that allows for horrible suffering

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:42.000
so that everything will work out OK in the end.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:51.000
Perhaps, but these ideas are all just variations on God controlling everything,

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:58.000
the supreme commander toying with expendable units in a great campaign.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:03.000
We are still left with a God who can do the tsunami and allow Auschwitz.

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:13.000
In his great novel, "The Brothers Karamazov," Dostoevsky gives these words to Ivan,

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:19.000
addressed to his naive and devout younger brother, Alyosha:

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:22.000
"If the sufferings of children go to make up the sum of sufferings

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:25.000
which is necessary for the purchase of truth,

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:33.000
then I say beforehand that the entire truth is not worth such a price.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:37.000
We cannot afford to pay so much for admission.

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:40.000
It is not God that I do not accept.

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:47.000
I merely, most respectfully, return Him the ticket."

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:52.000
Or perhaps God set the whole universe going at the beginning

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.000
and then relinquished control forever,

00:12:55.000 --> 00:13:00.000
so that natural processes could occur, and evolution run its course.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.000
This seems more acceptable,

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:10.000
but it still leaves God with the ultimate moral responsibility.

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:14.000
Is God a cold, unfeeling spectator?

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:19.000
Or a powerless lover, watching with infinite compassion

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:23.000
things God is unable to control or change?

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:27.000
Is God intimately involved in our suffering,

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:31.000
so that He feels it in His own being?

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:39.000
If we believe something like this, we must let go of the puppet-master completely,

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:44.000
take our leave of the almighty controller, abandon traditional models.

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:48.000
We must think again about God.

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:53.000
Maybe God doesn't do things at all.

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:58.000
Maybe God isn't an agent like all of us are agents.

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:03.000
Early religious thought conceived God as a sort of superhuman person,

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:05.000
doing things all over the place.

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:12.000
Beating up the Egyptians, drowning them in the Red Sea, wasting cities, getting angry.

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:15.000
The people knew their God by His mighty acts.

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:23.000
But what if God doesn't act? What if God doesn't do things at all?

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:27.000
What if God is in things?

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:30.000
The loving soul of the universe.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:38.000
An in-dwelling compassionate presence, underpinning and sustaining all things.

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:41.000
What if God is in things?

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:48.000
In the infinitely complex network of relationships and connections that make up life.

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:52.000
In the natural cycle of life and death,

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:57.000
the creation and destruction that must happen continuously.

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:00.000
In the process of evolution.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:06.000
In the incredible intricacy and magnificence of the natural world.

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:10.000
In the collective unconscious, the soul of the human race.

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:17.000
In you, in me, mind and body and spirit.

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:22.000
In the tsunami, in the victims. In the depth of things.

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:27.000
In presence and in absence. In simplicity and complexity.

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:31.000
In change and development and growth.

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:37.000
How does this in-ness, this innerness, this interiority of God work?

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:41.000
It's hard to conceive, and begs more questions.

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:44.000
Is God just another name for the universe,

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:46.000
with no independent existence at all?

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:48.000
I don't know.

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:55.000
To what extent can we ascribe personality to God?

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:57.000
I don't know.

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:01.000
In the end, we have to say, "I don't know."

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:03.000
If we knew, God would not be God.

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:06.000
To have faith in this God

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:11.000
would be more like trusting an essential benevolence in the universe,

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:16.000
and less like believing a system of doctrinal statements.

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:20.000
Isn't it ironic that Christians who claim to believe

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:22.000
in an infinite, unknowable being

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:28.000
then tie God down in closed systems and rigid doctrines?

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:34.000
How could one practice such a faith?

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:41.000
By seeking the God within. By cultivating my own inwardness.

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:50.000
In silence, in meditation, in my inner space, in the me that remains

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:59.000
when I gently put aside my passing emotions and ideas and preoccupations.

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:01.000
In awareness of the inner conversation.

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:08.000
And how would we live such a faith? How would I live such a faith?

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:13.000
By seeking intimate connection with your inwardness.

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:17.000
The kind of relationships when deep speaks to deep.

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:21.000
If God is in all people, then there is a meeting place

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:26.000
where my relationship with you becomes a three-way encounter.

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:32.000
There is an Indian greeting, which I'm sure some of you know:

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:36.000
"Namaste," accompanied by a respectful bow,

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:40.000
which, roughly translated means,

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:45.000
"That which is of God in me greets that which of God is in you."

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:48.000
Namaste.

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:53.000
And how would one deepen such a faith?

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:56.000
By seeking the inwardness which is in all things.

00:17:56.000 --> 00:18:01.000
In music and poetry, in the natural world of beauty

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:04.000
and in the small ordinary things of life,

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:09.000
there is a deep, indwelling presence that makes them extraordinary.

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:16.000
It needs a profound attentiveness and a patient waiting,

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:21.000
a contemplative attitude and a generosity and openness

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:25.000
to those whose experience is different from my own.

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:29.000
When I stood up to speak to my people about God and the tsunami,

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:32.000
I had no answers to offer them.

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:37.000
No neat packages of faith, with Bible references to prove them.

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:43.000
Only doubts and questioning and uncertainty.

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:46.000
I had some suggestions to make --

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:49.000
possible new ways of thinking about God.

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:55.000
Ways that might allow us to go on, down a new and uncharted road.

00:18:55.000 --> 00:19:03.000
But in the end, the only thing I could say for sure was, "I don't know,"

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:08.000
and that just might be the most profoundly religious statement of all.

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:10.000
Thank you.
