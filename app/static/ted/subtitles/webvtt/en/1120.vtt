00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.916
I am the daughter of a forger,

00:00:03.916 --> 00:00:05.861
not just any forger ...

00:00:05.861 --> 00:00:08.778
When you hear the word "forger," you often understand "mercenary."

00:00:08.778 --> 00:00:12.300
You understand "forged currency," "forged pictures."

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:14.612
My father is no such man.

00:00:14.612 --> 00:00:15.800
For 30 years of his life,

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:18.502
he made false papers --

00:00:18.502 --> 00:00:20.447
never for himself, always for other people,

00:00:20.447 --> 00:00:24.336
and to come to the aid of the persecuted and the oppressed.

00:00:24.336 --> 00:00:26.500
Let me introduce him.

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:29.500
Here is my father at age 19.

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:33.500
It all began for him during World War II,

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:35.500
when at age 17 he found himself thrust

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:37.200
into a forged documents workshop.

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:41.700
He quickly became the false papers expert of the Resistance.

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.500
And it's not a banal story --

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.500
after the liberation he continued

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.600
to make false papers until the '70s.

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:51.250
When I was a child

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:53.398
I knew nothing about this, of course.

00:00:53.398 --> 00:00:55.900
This is me in the middle making faces.

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:58.232
I grew up in the Paris suburbs

00:00:58.232 --> 00:01:02.121
and I was the youngest of three children.

00:01:02.121 --> 00:01:05.011
I had a "normal" dad like everybody else,

00:01:05.011 --> 00:01:06.956
apart from the fact that he was 30 years older than ...

00:01:06.956 --> 00:01:10.845
well, he was basically old enough to be my grandfather.

00:01:10.845 --> 00:01:13.800
Anyway, he was a photographer and a street educator,

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:17.400
and he always taught us to obey the law very strictly.

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.700
And, of course, he never talked about his past life

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:21.900
when he was a forger.

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.459
There was, however, an incident I'm going to tell you about,

00:01:24.459 --> 00:01:27.376
that perhaps could have led me suspect something.

00:01:27.376 --> 00:01:30.293
I was in high school and got a bad grade,

00:01:30.293 --> 00:01:32.238
a rare event for me,

00:01:32.238 --> 00:01:35.183
so I decided to hide it from my parents.

00:01:35.183 --> 00:01:39.072
In order to do that, I set out to forge their signature.

00:01:39.072 --> 00:01:42.200
I started working on my mother's signature,

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:44.907
because my father's is absolutely impossible to forge.

00:01:44.907 --> 00:01:47.824
So, I got working. I took some sheets of paper

00:01:47.824 --> 00:01:50.741
and started practicing, practicing, practicing,

00:01:50.742 --> 00:01:52.686
until I reached what I thought was a steady hand,

00:01:52.686 --> 00:01:54.630
and went into action.

00:01:54.631 --> 00:01:57.000
Later, while checking my school bag,

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.492
my mother got hold of my school assignment and immediately saw that the signature was forged.

00:02:00.492 --> 00:02:02.437
She yelled at me like she never had before.

00:02:02.437 --> 00:02:05.354
I went to hide in my bedroom, under the blankets,

00:02:05.354 --> 00:02:08.299
and then I waited for my father to come back from work

00:02:08.299 --> 00:02:10.189
with, one could say, much apprehension.

00:02:10.189 --> 00:02:12.161
I heard him come in.

00:02:12.161 --> 00:02:16.078
I remained under the blankets. He entered my room,

00:02:16.078 --> 00:02:18.023
sat on the corner of the bed,

00:02:18.023 --> 00:02:20.913
and he was silent, so I pulled the blanket from my head,

00:02:20.913 --> 00:02:23.830
and when he saw me he started laughing.

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:26.747
He was laughing so hard, he could not stop and he was holding my assignment in his hand.

00:02:26.747 --> 00:02:31.100
Then he said, "But really, Sarah, you could have worked harder! Can't you see it's really too small?"

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:37.000
Indeed, it's rather small.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
I was born in Algeria.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.305
There I would hear people say my father was a "moudjahid"

00:02:42.305 --> 00:02:43.500
and that means "fighter."

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:48.084
Later on, in France, I loved eavesdropping on grownups' conversations,

00:02:48.084 --> 00:02:51.001
and I would hear all sorts of stories about my father's previous life,

00:02:51.001 --> 00:02:53.919
especially that he had "done" World War II,

00:02:53.919 --> 00:02:55.863
that he had "done" the Algerian war.

00:02:55.863 --> 00:02:58.781
And in my head I would be thinking that "doing" a war meant being a soldier.

00:02:58.781 --> 00:03:02.698
But knowing my father, and how he kept saying that he was a pacifist and non-violent,

00:03:02.698 --> 00:03:06.000
I found it very hard to picture him with a helmet and gun.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
And indeed, I was very far from the mark.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.200
One day, while my father was working on a file

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:14.366
for us to obtain French nationality,

00:03:14.366 --> 00:03:16.311
I happened to see some documents

00:03:16.311 --> 00:03:18.728
that caught my attention.

00:03:18.728 --> 00:03:20.400
These are real!

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:23.118
These are mine, I was born an Argentinean.

00:03:23.118 --> 00:03:24.900
But the document I happened to see

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:27.007
that would help us build a case for the authorities

00:03:27.007 --> 00:03:29.700
was a document from the army

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:32.869
that thanked my father for his work

00:03:32.869 --> 00:03:34.788
on behalf of the secret services.

00:03:34.788 --> 00:03:37.705
And then, suddenly, I went "wow!"

00:03:37.705 --> 00:03:39.400
My father, a secret agent?

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:41.566
It was very James Bond.

00:03:41.566 --> 00:03:46.455
I wanted to ask him questions, which he didn't answer.

00:03:46.455 --> 00:03:49.400
And later, I told myself that

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:52.000
one day I would have to question him.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.151
And then I became a mother and had a son,

00:03:54.151 --> 00:03:57.300
and finally decided it was time -- that he absolutely had to talk to us.

00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:59.300
I had become a mother

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:01.300
and he was celebrating his 77th birthday,

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:03.600
and suddenly I was very, very afraid.

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:05.848
I feared he'd go

00:04:05.848 --> 00:04:07.793
and take his silences with him,

00:04:07.793 --> 00:04:09.737
and take his secrets with him.

00:04:09.737 --> 00:04:12.100
I managed to convince him that it was important for us,

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:13.627
but possibly also for other people

00:04:13.627 --> 00:04:15.572
that he shared his story.

00:04:15.572 --> 00:04:17.516
He decided to tell it to me

00:04:17.516 --> 00:04:18.800
and I made a book,

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:21.406
from which I'm going to read you some excerpts later.

00:04:21.406 --> 00:04:24.323
So, his story. My father was born in Argentina.

00:04:24.323 --> 00:04:26.268
His parents were of Russian descent.

00:04:26.268 --> 00:04:30.185
The whole family came to settle in France in the '30s.

00:04:30.186 --> 00:04:35.000
His parents were Jewish, Russian and above all, very poor.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.000
So at the age of 14 my father had to work.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:39.200
And with his only diploma,

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:40.500
his primary education certificate,

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:43.000
he found himself working at a dyer - dry cleaner.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.200
That's where he discovered something totally magical,

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:48.000
and when he talks about it, it's fascinating --

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.800
it's the magic of dyeing chemistry.

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:52.600
During that time the war was happening

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:55.467
and his mother was killed when he was 15.

00:04:55.468 --> 00:04:58.000
This coincided with the time when

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000
he threw himself body and soul into chemistry

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.700
because it was the only consolation for his sadness.

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:06.163
All day he would ask many questions to his boss

00:05:06.164 --> 00:05:09.000
to learn, to accumulate more and more knowledge,

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:10.500
and at night, when no one was looking,

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:12.700
he'd put his experience to practice.

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:17.800
He was mostly interested in ink bleaching.

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:20.000
All this to tell you

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.500
that if my father became a forger, actually,

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:24.500
it was almost by accident.

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:27.000
His family was Jewish, so they were hounded.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000
Finally they were all arrested and taken to the Drancy camp

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.200
and they managed to get out at the last minute thanks to their Argentinean papers.

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:34.335
Well, they were out,

00:05:34.336 --> 00:05:37.252
but they were always in danger. The big "Jew" stamp was still on their papers.

00:05:37.253 --> 00:05:40.500
It was my grandfather who decided they needed false documents.

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:44.000
My father had been instilled with such respect for the law

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000
that although he was being persecuted,

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.000
he'd never thought of false papers.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.000
But it was he who went to meet a man from the Resistance.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.500
In those times documents had hard covers,

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:55.000
they were filled in by hand,

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.000
and they stated your job.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.200
In order to survive, he needed

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:02.200
to be working. He asked the man

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:04.000
to write "dyer."

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.000
Suddenly the man looked very, very interested.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.200
As a "dyer," do you know how to bleach ink marks?

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:12.500
Of course he knew.

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:14.300
And suddenly the man started explaining that

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:17.000
actually the whole Resistance had a huge problem:

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.600
even the top experts

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:23.200
could not manage to bleach an ink, called "indelible,"

00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:25.400
the "Waterman" blue ink.

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:29.300
And my father immediately replied that he knew exactly

00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:30.500
how to bleach it.

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:33.700
Now, of course, the man was very impressed with this young man of 17

00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:37.500
who could immediately give him the formula, so he recruited him.

00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:40.500
And actually, without knowing it, my father had invented something

00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:43.150
we can find in every schoolchild's pencil case:

00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:46.000
the so-called "correction pen."

00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:51.500
(Applause)

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:53.400
But it was only the beginning.

00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:55.000
That's my father.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:56.500
As soon as he got to the lab,

00:06:56.500 --> 00:06:57.900
even though he was the youngest,

00:06:57.900 --> 00:07:00.800
he immediately saw that there was a problem with the making of forged documents.

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:03.700
All the movements stopped at falsifying.

00:07:03.700 --> 00:07:06.300
But demand was ever-growing

00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:08.900
and it was difficult to tamper with existing documents.

00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:10.400
He told himself it was necessary to make them from scratch.

00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:13.200
He started a press. He started photoengraving.

00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:14.800
He started making rubber stamps.

00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:16.600
He started inventing all kind of things --

00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:20.000
with some materials he invented a centrifuge using a bicycle wheel.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.000
Anyway, he had to do all this

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.800
because he was completely obsessed with output.

00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:27.000
He had made a simple calculation:

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.100
In one hour he could make 30 forged documents.

00:07:30.100 --> 00:07:34.500
If he slept one hour, 30 people would die.

00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:37.500
This sense of

00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:40.700
responsibility for other people's lives when he was just 17 --

00:07:40.700 --> 00:07:43.700
and also his guilt for being a survivor,

00:07:43.700 --> 00:07:47.300
since he had escaped the camp when his friends had not --

00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:49.552
stayed with him all his life.

00:07:49.553 --> 00:07:52.470
And this is maybe what explains why, for 30 years,

00:07:52.471 --> 00:07:55.100
he continued to make false papers

00:07:55.100 --> 00:07:57.400
at the expense of all kinds of sacrifices.

00:07:57.400 --> 00:07:58.300
I'd like to talk about those sacrifices,

00:07:58.300 --> 00:08:00.200
because there were many.

00:08:00.200 --> 00:08:02.700
There were obviously financial sacrifices

00:08:02.700 --> 00:08:04.500
because he always refused to be paid.

00:08:04.500 --> 00:08:07.200
To him, being paid would have meant being a mercenary.

00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:08.800
If he had accepted payment,

00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:10.600
he wouldn't be able to say "yes" or "no"

00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:13.000
depending on what he deemed a just or unjust cause.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:14.900
So he was a photographer by day,

00:08:14.900 --> 00:08:16.500
and a forger by night for 30 years.

00:08:16.500 --> 00:08:18.500
He was broke all of the time.

00:08:18.500 --> 00:08:21.500
Then there were the emotional sacrifices:

00:08:21.500 --> 00:08:24.500
How can one live with a woman while having so many secrets?

00:08:24.500 --> 00:08:28.700
How can one explain what one does at night in the lab, every single night?

00:08:28.700 --> 00:08:32.000
Of course, there was another kind of sacrifice

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:35.400
involving his family that I understood much later.

00:08:35.400 --> 00:08:38.500
One day my father introduced me to my sister.

00:08:38.500 --> 00:08:42.500
He also explained to me that I had a brother, too,

00:08:42.500 --> 00:08:48.500
and the first time I saw them I must have been three or four,

00:08:48.500 --> 00:08:50.300
and they were 30 years older than me.

00:08:50.300 --> 00:08:55.800
They are both in their sixties now.

00:08:55.800 --> 00:08:58.500
In order to write the book,

00:08:58.500 --> 00:09:02.000
I asked my sister questions. I wanted to know who my father was,

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:03.500
who was the father she had known.

00:09:03.500 --> 00:09:07.600
She explained that the father that she'd had

00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:11.800
would tell them he'd come and pick them up on Sunday to go for a walk.

00:09:11.800 --> 00:09:14.400
They would get all dressed up and wait for him,

00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:16.200
but he would almost never come.

00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:19.500
He'd say, "I'll call." He wouldn't call.

00:09:19.500 --> 00:09:21.500
And then he would not come.

00:09:21.500 --> 00:09:24.800
Then one day he totally disappeared.

00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:26.200
Time passed,

00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:29.400
and they thought he had surely forgotten them,

00:09:29.400 --> 00:09:31.000
at first.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:32.500
Then as time passed,

00:09:32.500 --> 00:09:34.500
at the end of almost two years, they thought,

00:09:34.500 --> 00:09:37.700
"Well, perhaps our father has died."

00:09:37.700 --> 00:09:40.000
And then I understood

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.900
that asking my father so many questions

00:09:42.900 --> 00:09:45.700
was stirring up a whole past he probably didn't feel like talking about

00:09:45.700 --> 00:09:47.300
because it was painful.

00:09:47.300 --> 00:09:52.000
And while my half brother and sister thought they'd been abandoned,

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:53.700
orphaned,

00:09:53.700 --> 00:09:56.000
my father was making false papers.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:59.500
And if he did not tell them, it was of course to protect them.

00:09:59.500 --> 00:10:01.300
After the liberation he made false papers

00:10:01.300 --> 00:10:04.200
to allow the survivors of concentration camps to immigrate to Palestine

00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:06.100
before the creation of Israel.

00:10:06.100 --> 00:10:08.500
And then, as he was a staunch anti-colonialist,

00:10:08.500 --> 00:10:12.000
he made false papers for Algerians during the Algerian war.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.600
After the Algerian war,

00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:17.200
at the heart of the international resistance movements,

00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:18.900
his name circulated

00:10:18.900 --> 00:10:21.200
and the whole world came knocking at his door.

00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:24.700
In Africa there were countries fighting for their independence:

00:10:24.700 --> 00:10:27.700
Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Angola.

00:10:27.700 --> 00:10:32.200
And then my father connected with Nelson Mandela's anti-apartheid party.

00:10:32.200 --> 00:10:35.700
He made false papers for persecuted black South Africans.

00:10:35.700 --> 00:10:37.500
There was also Latin America.

00:10:37.500 --> 00:10:40.200
My father helped those who resisted dictatorships

00:10:40.200 --> 00:10:42.100
in the Dominican Republic, Haiti,

00:10:42.100 --> 00:10:48.200
and then it was the turn of Brazil, Argentina, Venezuela, El Salvador, Nicaragua,

00:10:48.200 --> 00:10:53.800
Colombia, Peru, Uruguay, Chile and Mexico.

00:10:53.800 --> 00:10:55.500
Then there was the Vietnam War.

00:10:55.500 --> 00:10:57.800
My father made false papers for the American deserters

00:10:57.800 --> 00:11:01.000
who did not wish to take up arms against the Vietnamese.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:03.000
Europe was not spared either.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:05.141
My father made false papers for the dissidents

00:11:05.142 --> 00:11:08.900
against Franco in Spain, Salazar in Portugal,

00:11:08.900 --> 00:11:13.892
against the colonels' dictatorship in Greece,

00:11:13.893 --> 00:11:15.600
and even in France.

00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:18.754
There, just once, it happened in May of 1968.

00:11:18.755 --> 00:11:21.400
My father watched, benevolently, of course,

00:11:21.400 --> 00:11:24.200
the demonstrations of the month of May,

00:11:24.200 --> 00:11:26.500
but his heart was elsewhere, and so was his time

00:11:26.500 --> 00:11:30.000
because he had over 15 countries to serve.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.368
Once, though, he agreed to make false papers

00:11:32.369 --> 00:11:34.312
for someone you might recognize.

00:11:34.313 --> 00:11:37.229
(Laughter)

00:11:37.230 --> 00:11:38.850
He was much younger in those days,

00:11:38.850 --> 00:11:41.000
and my father agreed to make false papers

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:44.036
to enable him to come back and speak at a meeting.

00:11:44.037 --> 00:11:49.000
He told me that those false papers were the most media-relevant

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:52.500
and the least useful he'd had to make in all his life.

00:11:52.500 --> 00:11:54.000
But, he agreed to do it,

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:57.400
even though Daniel Cohn-Bendit's life was not in danger,

00:11:57.400 --> 00:11:59.594
just because

00:11:59.595 --> 00:12:01.000
it was a good opportunity

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.484
to mock the authorities,

00:12:03.485 --> 00:12:06.500
and to show them that there's nothing more porous than borders --

00:12:06.500 --> 00:12:11.000
and that ideas have no borders.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.000
All my childhood,

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:17.097
while my friends' dads would tell them Grimm's fairy tales,

00:12:17.098 --> 00:12:20.987
my father would tell me stories about very unassuming heroes

00:12:20.988 --> 00:12:23.904
with unshakeable utopias

00:12:23.905 --> 00:12:26.821
who managed to make miracles.

00:12:26.822 --> 00:12:30.800
And those heroes did not need an army behind them.

00:12:30.800 --> 00:12:33.300
Anyhow, nobody would have followed them,

00:12:33.300 --> 00:12:36.545
except for a handful [of] men and women of conviction and courage.

00:12:36.546 --> 00:12:37.800
I understood much later

00:12:37.800 --> 00:12:41.407
that actually it was his own story my father would tell me to get me to sleep.

00:12:41.408 --> 00:12:44.324
I asked him whether, considering the sacrifices he had to make,

00:12:44.325 --> 00:12:46.269
he ever had any regrets.

00:12:46.270 --> 00:12:48.000
He said no.

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.159
He told me that he would have been unable

00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:53.076
to witness or submit to injustice without doing anything.

00:12:53.077 --> 00:12:56.100
He was persuaded, and he's still convinced

00:12:56.100 --> 00:12:58.300
that another world is possible --

00:12:58.300 --> 00:13:01.300
a world where no one would ever need a forger.

00:13:01.300 --> 00:13:03.300
He's still dreaming about it.

00:13:03.300 --> 00:13:04.744
My father

00:13:04.745 --> 00:13:06.500
is here in the room today.

00:13:06.500 --> 00:13:10.579
His name is Adolfo Kaminsky and I'm going to ask him to stand up.

00:13:10.580 --> 00:13:30.999
(Applause)

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:34.000
Thank you.
