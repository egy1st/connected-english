00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Roger Ebert: These are my words, but this is not my voice.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
This is Alex, the best computer voice

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
I've been able to find,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
which comes as standard equipment on every Macintosh.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
For most of my life,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
I never gave a second thought to my ability to speak.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
It was like breathing.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
In those days, I was living in a fool's paradise.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
After surgeries for cancer

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
took away my ability to speak, eat or drink,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
I was forced to enter this virtual world

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
in which a computer does some of my living for me.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
For several days now,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
we have enjoyed brilliant and articulate speakers here at TED.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
I used to be able to talk like that.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Maybe I wasn't as smart,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
but I was at least as talkative.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
I want to devote my talk today

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
to the act of speaking itself,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
and how the act of speaking or not speaking

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
is tied so indelibly to one's identity

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
as to force the birth of a new person

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
when it is taken away.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
However, I've found that listening to a computer voice

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
for any great length of time

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
can be monotonous.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
So I've decided to recruit some of my TED friends

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
to read my words aloud for me.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
I will start with my wife, Chaz.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
Chaz Ebert: It was Chaz who stood by my side

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
through three attempts to reconstruct my jaw

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
and restore my ability to speak.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
Going into the first surgery

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
for a recurrence of salivary cancer

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
in 2006,

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
I expected to be out of the hospital

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
in time to return to my movie review show,

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
'Ebert and Roeper at the Movies.'

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
I had pre-taped enough shows

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
to get me through six weeks of surgery

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
and recuperation.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
The doctors took a fibula bone from my leg

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
and some tissue from my shoulder

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
to fashion into a new jaw.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000
My tongue, larynx and vocal cords

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
were still healthy and unaffected.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
(Laughter)

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:06.000
(Laughter)

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
CE: I was optimistic,

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
and all was right with the world.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
The first surgery was a great success.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
I saw myself in the mirror

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000
and I looked pretty good.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000
Two weeks later, I was ready to return home.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
I was using my iPod

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
to play the Leonard Cohen song

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
'I'm Your Man'

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
for my doctors and nurses.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.000
Suddenly, I had an episode of catastrophic bleeding.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
My carotid artery had ruptured.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
Thank God I was still in my hospital room

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
and my doctors were right there.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
Chaz told me

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
that if that song hadn't played for so long,

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000
I might have already been in the car, on the way home,

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000
and would have died right there and then.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
So thank you, Leonard Cohen,

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000
for saving my life.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.000
(Applause)

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000
There was a second surgery --

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
which held up for five or six days

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000
and then it also fell apart.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
And then a third attempt,

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000
which also patched me back together pretty well,

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000
until it failed.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000
A doctor from Brazil said

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.000
he had never seen anyone survive

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.000
a carotid artery rupture.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.000
And before I left the hospital,

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000
after a year of being hospitalized,

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000
I had seven ruptures

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000
of my carotid artery.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000
There was no particular day

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000
when anyone told me

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000
I would never speak again;

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000
it just sort of became obvious.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000
Human speech

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.000
is an ingenious manipulation of our breath

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.000
within the sound chamber of our mouth

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.000
and respiratory system.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.000
We need to be able to hold and manipulate that breath

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.000
in order to form sounds.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000
Therefore, the system

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.000
must be essentially airtight

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.000
in order to capture air.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000
Because I had lost my jaw,

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000
I could no longer form a seal,

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000
and therefore my tongue

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.000
and all of my other vocal equipment

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.000
was rendered powerless.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
Dean Ornish: At first for a long time,

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
I wrote messages in notebooks.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
Then I tried typing words on my laptop

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000
and using its built in voice.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000
This was faster,

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000
and nobody had to try to read my handwriting.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.000
I tried out various computer voices that were available online,

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000
and for several months I had a British accent,

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000
which Chaz called Sir Lawrence."

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000
(Laughter)

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000
"It was the clearest I could find.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000
Then Apple released the Alex voice,

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000
which was the best I'd heard.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000
It knew things like the difference

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000
between an exclamation point and a question mark.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000
When it saw a period, it knew how to make a sentence

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:03.000
sound like it was ending instead of staying up in the air.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000
There are all sorts of html codes you can use

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.000
to control the timing and inflection of computer voices,

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000
and I've experimented with them.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.000
For me, they share a fundamental problem: they're too slow.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.000
When I find myself in a conversational situation,

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.000
I need to type fast and to jump right in.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000
People don't have the time or the patience

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000
to wait for me to fool around with the codes

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000
for every word or phrase.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.000
But what value do we place on the sound of our own voice?

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.000
How does that affect who you are as a person?

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.000
When people hear Alex speaking my words,

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000
do they experience a disconnect?

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.000
Does that create a separation or a distance

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.000
from one person to the next?

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000
How did I feel not being able to speak?

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000
I felt, and I still feel,

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000
a lot of distance from the human mainstream.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:51.000
I've become uncomfortable when I'm separated from my laptop.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000
Even then, I'm aware that most people have little patience

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.000
for my speaking difficulties.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.000
So Chaz suggested finding a company that could make a customized voice

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000
using my TV show voice

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.000
from a period of 30 years.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000
At first I was against it.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000
I thought it would be creepy

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.000
to hear my own voice coming from a computer.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.000
There was something comforting about a voice that was not my own.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000
But I decided then to just give it a try.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.000
So we contacted a company in Scotland

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.000
that created personalized computer voices.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.000
They'd never made one from previously-recorded materials.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000
All of their voices had been made by a speaker

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000
recording original words in a control booth.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000
But they were willing to give it a try.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.000
So I sent them many hours of recordings of my voice,

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.000
including several audio commentary tracks

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.000
that I'd made for movies on DVDs.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.000
And it sounded like me, it really did.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.000
There was a reason for that; it was me.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.000
But it wasn't that simple.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:46.000
The tapes from my TV show weren't very useful

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:49.000
because there were too many other kinds of audio involved --

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:52.000
movie soundtracks, for example, or Gene Siskel arguing with me --

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000
(Laughter)

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000
and my words often had a particular emphasis

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.000
that didn't fit into a sentence well enough.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000
I'll let you hear a sample of that voice.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:04.000
These are a few of the comments I recorded for use

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:07.000
when Chaz and I appeared on the Oprah Winfrey program.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000
And here's the voice we call Roger Jr.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.000
or Roger 2.0.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.000
Roger 2.0: Oprah, I can't tell you how great it is

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.000
to be back on your show.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.000
We have been talking for a long time,

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.000
and now here we are again.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:25.000
This is the first version of my computer voice.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.000
It still needs improvement,

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000
but at least it sounds like me

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:32.000
and not like HAL 9000.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.000
When I heard it the first time,

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:37.000
it sent chills down my spine.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.000
When I type anything,

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.000
this voice will speak whatever I type.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:44.000
When I read something, it will read in my voice.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:47.000
I have typed these words in advance,

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.000
as I didn't think it would be thrilling

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.000
to sit here watching me typing.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:54.000
The voice was created by a company in Scotland

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.000
named CereProc.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.000
It makes me feel good

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:01.000
that many of the words you are hearing were first spoken

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:04.000
while I was commenting on "Casablanca"

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:07.000
and "Citizen Kane."

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:10.000
This is the first voice they've created for an individual.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:13.000
There are several very good voices available for computers,

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:16.000
but they all sound like somebody else,

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:19.000
while this voice sounds like me.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:22.000
I plan to use it on television, radio

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.000
and the Internet.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.000
People who need a voice should know

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:30.000
that most computers already come with built-in speaking systems.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000
Many blind people use them

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:35.000
to read pages on the Web to themselves.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.000
But I've got to say, in first grade,

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.000
they said I talked too much,

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.000
and now I still can.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:44.000
(Laughter)

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:47.000
Roger Ebert: As you can hear, it sounds like me,

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.000
but the words jump up and down.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000
The flow isn't natural.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:54.000
The good people in Scotland are still improving my voice,

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.000
and I'm optimistic about it.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.000
But so far, the Apple Alex voice

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.000
is the best one I've heard.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000
I wrote a blog about it

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:05.000
and actually got a comment from the actor who played Alex.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:08.000
He said he recorded many long hours in various intonations

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.000
to be used in the voice.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:13.000
A very large sample is needed.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:16.000
John Hunter: All my life I was a motormouth.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:19.000
Now I have spoken my last words,

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.000
and I don't even remember for sure

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.000
what they were.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:26.000
I feel like the hero of that Harlan Ellison story

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:30.000
titled "I Have No Mouth and I Must Scream."

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:33.000
On Wednesday, David Christian explained to us

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:36.000
what a tiny instant the human race represents

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.000
in the time-span of the universe.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:41.000
For almost all of its millions and billions of years,

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:44.000
there was no life on Earth at all.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:47.000
For almost all the years of life on Earth,

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.000
there was no intelligent life.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.000
Only after we learned to pass knowledge

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.000
from one generation to the next,

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.000
did civilization become possible.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.000
In cosmological terms,

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:00.000
that was about 10 minutes ago.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:04.000
Finally came mankind's most advanced and mysterious tool,

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.000
the computer.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:09.000
That has mostly happened in my lifetime.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.000
Some of the famous early computers

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:14.000
were being built in my hometown of Urbana,

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:17.000
the birthplace of HAL 9000.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.000
When I heard the amazing talk

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.000
by Salman Khan on Wednesday,

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.000
about the Khan Academy website

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:26.000
that teaches hundreds of subjects to students all over the world,

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.000
I had a flashback.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:31.000
It was about 1960.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:34.000
As a local newspaper reporter still in high school,

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:37.000
I was sent over to the computer lab of the University of Illinois

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.000
to interview the creators

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.000
of something called PLATO.

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.000
The initials stood for Programmed Logic

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:47.000
for Automated Teaching Operations.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:50.000
This was a computer-assisted instruction system,

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:53.000
which in those days ran on a computer named ILLIAC.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:57.000
The programmers said it could assist students in their learning.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:00.000
I doubt, on that day 50 years ago,

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:04.000
they even dreamed of what Salman Khan has accomplished.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:06.000
But that's not the point.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:09.000
The point is PLATO was only 50 years ago,

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.000
an instant in time.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:14.000
It continued to evolve and operated in one form or another

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:17.000
on more and more sophisticated computers,

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.000
until only five years ago.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.000
I have learned from Wikipedia

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:24.000
that, starting with that humble beginning,

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:27.000
PLATO established forums, message boards,

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.000
online testing,

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.000
email, chat rooms,

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:34.000
picture languages, instant messaging,

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.000
remote screen sharing

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:39.000
and multiple-player games.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:42.000
Since the first Web browser was also developed in Urbana,

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:44.000
it appears that my hometown

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:46.000
in downstate Illinois

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.000
was the birthplace

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:51.000
of much of the virtual, online universe we occupy today.

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.000
But I'm not here from the Chamber of Commerce.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.000
(Laughter)

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:58.000
I'm here as a man who wants to communicate.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:01.000
All of this has happened in my lifetime.

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:04.000
I started writing on a computer back in the 1970s

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:07.000
when one of the first Atech systems was installed

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:10.000
at the Chicago Sun-Times.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.000
I was in line at Radio Shack

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:15.000
to buy one of the first Model 100's.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:18.000
And when I told the people in the press room at the Academy Awards

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:21.000
that they'd better install some phone lines for Internet connections,

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:24.000
they didn't know what I was talking about.

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:26.000
When I bought my first desktop,

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.000
it was a DEC Rainbow.

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.000
Does anybody remember that?"

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:33.000
(Applause)

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:35.000
"The Sun Times sent me to the Cannes Film Festival

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:39.000
with a portable computer the size of a suitcase

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:41.000
named the Porteram Telebubble.

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.000
I joined CompuServe

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:45.000
when it had fewer numbers

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:47.000
than I currently have followers on Twitter.

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:49.000
(Laughter)

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.000
CE: All of this has happened

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.000
in the blink of an eye.

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.000
It is unimaginable

00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:59.000
what will happen next.

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:02.000
It makes me incredibly fortunate

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:04.000
to live at this moment in history.

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:07.000
Indeed, I am lucky to live in history at all,

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:10.000
because without intelligence and memory

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.000
there is no history.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.000
For billions of years,

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.000
the universe evolved

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.000
completely without notice.

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:21.000
Now we live in the age of the Internet,

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:24.000
which seems to be creating a form of global consciousness.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.000
And because of it,

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:28.000
I can communicate

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.000
as well as I ever could.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.000
We are born into a box

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:35.000
of time and space.

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:37.000
We use words and communication

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:39.000
to break out of it

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:42.000
and to reach out to others.

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.000
For me, the Internet began

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:46.000
as a useful tool

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:49.000
and now has become something I rely on

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:52.000
for my actual daily existence.

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:54.000
I cannot speak;

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:57.000
I can only type so fast.

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:59.000
Computer voices

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:02.000
are sometimes not very sophisticated,

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.000
but with my computer,

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:06.000
I can communicate more widely

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:08.000
than ever before.

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:11.000
I feel as if my blog,

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:14.000
my email, Twitter and Facebook

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.000
have given me a substitute

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:19.000
for everyday conversation.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:21.000
They aren't an improvement,

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:23.000
but they're the best I can do.

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:26.000
They give me a way to speak.

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:29.000
Not everybody has the patience

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:32.000
of my wife, Chaz.

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:34.000
But online,

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:37.000
everybody speaks at the same speed.

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:41.000
This whole adventure

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:43.000
has been a learning experience.

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:46.000
Every time there was a surgery that failed,

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:49.000
I was left with a little less flesh and bone.

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:52.000
Now I have no jaw left at all.

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:55.000
While harvesting tissue from both my shoulders,

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:57.000
the surgeries left me with back pain

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:01.000
and reduced my ability to walk easily.

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.000
Ironic that my legs are fine,

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:06.000
and it's my shoulders that slow up my walk.

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:08.000
When you see me today,

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:10.000
I look like the Phantom of the Opera.

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:12.000
But no you don't.

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:14.000
(Laughter)

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:22.000
(Applause)

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:27.000
It is human nature to look at someone like me

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:31.000
and assume I have lost some of my marbles.

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:33.000
People --

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:48.000
(Applause)

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:50.000
People talk loudly --

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:52.000
I'm so sorry.

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:54.000
Excuse me.

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:58.000
(Applause)

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:02.000
People talk loudly and slowly to me.

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:05.000
Sometimes they assume I am deaf.

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:08.000
There are people who don't want to make eye contact.

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:11.000
Believe me, he didn't mean this as --

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:13.000
anyway, let me just read it.

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:16.000
(Laughter)

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:21.000
You should never let your wife read something like this.

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:25.000
(Laughter)

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:27.000
It is human nature

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:30.000
to look away from illness.

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:32.000
We don't enjoy a reminder

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:35.000
of our own fragile mortality.

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:37.000
That's why writing on the Internet

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:39.000
has become a lifesaver for me.

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:42.000
My ability to think and write

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:44.000
have not been affected.

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:47.000
And on the Web, my real voice finds expression.

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:50.000
I have also met many other disabled people

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:53.000
who communicate this way.

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:55.000
One of my Twitter friends

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:57.000
can type only with his toes.

00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:59.000
One of the funniest blogs on the Web

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:01.000
is written by a friend of mine

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:03.000
named Smartass Cripple.

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:05.000
(Laughter)

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:08.000
Google him and he will make you laugh.

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:10.000
All of these people are saying, in one way or another,

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:12.000
that what you see

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:14.000
is not all you get.

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:17.000
So I have not come here to complain.

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:20.000
I have much to make me happy and relieved.

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:22.000
I seem, for the time being,

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:24.000
to be cancer-free.

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:26.000
I am writing as well as ever.

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:28.000
I am productive.

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:31.000
If I were in this condition at any point

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:34.000
before a few cosmological instants ago,

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:37.000
I would be as isolated as a hermit.

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:39.000
I would be trapped inside my head.

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:42.000
Because of the rush of human knowledge,

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:44.000
because of the digital revolution,

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:46.000
I have a voice,

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:49.000
and I do not need to scream.

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:54.000
RE: Wait. I have one more thing to add.

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:57.000
A guy goes into a psychiatrist.

00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:00.000
The psychiatrist says, "You're crazy."

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:03.000
The guy says, "I want a second opinion."

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:07.000
The psychiatrist says, "All right, you're ugly."

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:10.000
(Laughter)

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:14.000
You all know the test for artificial intelligence -- the Turing test.

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:16.000
A human judge has a conversation

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:18.000
with a human and a computer.

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:21.000
If the judge can't tell the machine apart from the human,

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:24.000
the machine has passed the test.

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:28.000
I now propose a test for computer voices -- the Ebert test.

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:31.000
If a computer voice can successfully tell a joke

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:34.000
and do the timing and delivery as well as Henny Youngman,

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:36.000
then that's the voice I want.

00:18:36.000 --> 00:19:08.000
(Applause)
