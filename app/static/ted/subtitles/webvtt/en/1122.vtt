00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Hi, my name is Marcin --

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
farmer, technologist.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
I was born in Poland, now in the U.S.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
I started a group called Open Source Ecology.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
We've identified the 50 most important machines

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
that we think it takes for modern life to exist --

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
things from tractors,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
bread ovens, circuit makers.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Then we set out to create

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
an open source, DIY, do it yourself version

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
that anyone can build and maintain

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
at a fraction of the cost.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
We call this the Global Village Construction Set.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
So let me tell you a story.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
So I finished my 20s

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
with a Ph.D. in fusion energy,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
and I discovered I was useless.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
I had no practical skills.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
The world presented me with options,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
and I took them.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
I guess you can call it the consumer lifestyle.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
So I started a farm in Missouri

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
and learned about the economics of farming.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
I bought a tractor -- then it broke.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
I paid to get it repaired --

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
then it broke again.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
Then pretty soon,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
I was broke too.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
I realized

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
that the truly appropriate, low-cost tools that I needed

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
to start a sustainable farm and settlement

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
just didn't exist yet.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
I needed tools that were robust, modular,

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
highly efficient and optimized,

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
low-cost,

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
made from local and recycled materials that would last a lifetime,

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
not designed for obsolescence.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
I found that I would have to build them myself.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
So I did just that.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
And I tested them.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
And I found that industrial productivity

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
can be achieved on a small scale.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
So then I published the 3D designs,

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
schematics,

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
instructional videos and budgets

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
on a wiki.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
Then contributors from all over the world

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
began showing up, prototyping new machines

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
during dedicated project visits.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
So far, we have prototyped eight of the 50 machines.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
And now the project

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
is beginning to grow on its own.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
We know that open source has succeeded

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
with tools for managing knowledge and creativity.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
And the same is starting to happen with hardware too.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
We're focusing on hardware

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000
because it is hardware that can change people's lives

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000
in such tangible material ways.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
If we can lower the barriers to farming, building, manufacturing,

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
then we can unleash just massive amounts of human potential.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
That's not only in the developing world.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
Our tools are being made

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000
for the American farmer, builder, entrepreneur, maker.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
We've seen lots of excitement from these people,

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
who can now start a construction business,

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
parts manufacturing,

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
organic CSA

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000
or just selling power back to the grid.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
Our goal is a repository of published designs

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
so clear, so complete,

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
that a single burned DVD

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000
is effectively a civilization starter kit.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000
I've planted a hundred trees in a day.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000
I've pressed 5,000 bricks in one day

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.000
from the dirt beneath my feet

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000
and built a tractor in six days.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000
From what I've seen, this is only the beginning.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000
If this idea is truly sound,

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.000
then the implications are significant.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.000
A greater distribution of the means of production,

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.000
environmentally sound supply chains,

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.000
and a newly relevant DIY maker culture

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000
can hope to transcend

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000
artificial scarcity.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000
We're exploring the limits

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.000
of what we all can do to make a better world

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000
with open hardware technology.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000
Thank you.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000
(Applause)
