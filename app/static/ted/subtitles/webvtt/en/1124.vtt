WEBVTT

00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:05.000
So I was privileged to train in transplantation

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
under two great surgical pioneers:

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Thomas Starzl,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
who performed the world's first successful liver transplant

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
in 1967,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
and Sir Roy Calne,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
who performed the first liver transplant in the U.K.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
in the following year.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
I returned to Singapore

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
and, in 1990,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
performed Asia's first successful

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
cadaveric liver transplant procedure,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
but against all odds.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Now when I look back,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
the transplant was actually the easiest part.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
Next, raising the money to fund the procedure.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
But perhaps the most challenging part

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
was to convince the regulators --

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000
a matter which was debated in the parliament --

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
that a young female surgeon

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
be allowed the opportunity

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
to pioneer for her country.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
But 20 years on,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
my patient, Surinder,

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
is Asia's longest surviving

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
cadaveric liver transplant to date.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.000
(Applause)

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
And perhaps more important,

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
I am the proud godmother

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
to her 14 year-old son.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
(Applause)

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
But not all patients on the transplant wait list

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
are so fortunate.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
The truth is,

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
there are just simply not enough donor organs

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
to go around.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
As the demand for donor organs

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
continues to rise,

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
in large part due to the aging population,

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.000
the supply has remained relatively constant.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
In the United States alone,

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000
100,000 men, women and children

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
are on the waiting list for donor organs,

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
and more than a dozen die each day

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
because of a lack of donor organs.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
The transplant community

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
has actively campaigned in organ donation.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
And the gift of life

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
has been extended

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
from brain-dead donors

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
to living, related donors --

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000
relatives who might donate an organ

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
or a part of an organ,

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
like a split liver graft,

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
to a relative or loved one.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
But as there was still a dire shortage of donor organs,

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
the gift of life was then extended

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
from living, related donors

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000
to now living, unrelated donors.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000
And this then has given rise

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000
to unprecedented and unexpected

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
moral controversy.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000
How can one distinguish

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000
a donation that is voluntary and altruistic

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000
from one that is forced or coerced

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
from, for example,

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
a submissive spouse, an in-law,

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
a servant, a slave,

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
an employee?

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000
Where and how can we draw the line?

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000
In my part of the world,

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000
too many people live below the poverty line.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000
And in some areas,

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
the commercial gifting of an organ

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000
in exchange for monetary reward

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000
has led to a flourishing trade

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.000
in living, unrelated donors.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000
Shortly after I performed the first liver transplant,

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000
I received my next assignment,

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.000
and that was to go to the prisons

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000
to harvest organs

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.000
from executed prisoners.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.000
I was also pregnant at the time.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000
Pregnancies are meant

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000
to be happy and fulfilling moments

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000
in any woman's life.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000
But my joyful period

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:54.000
was marred by solemn and morbid thoughts --

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000
thoughts of walking through

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.000
the prison's high-security death row,

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
as this was the only route

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:05.000
to take me to the makeshift operating room.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000
And at each time,

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.000
I would feel the chilling stares

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.000
of condemned prisoners' eyes follow me.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000
And for two years,

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000
I struggled with the dilemma

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000
of waking up at 4:30 am

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000
on a Friday morning,

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000
driving to the prison,

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000
getting down, gloved and scrubbed,

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.000
ready to receive the body

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000
of an executed prisoner,

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000
remove the organs

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000
and then transport these organs

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000
to the recipient hospital

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.000
and then graft the gift of life

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.000
to a recipient the same afternoon.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000
No doubt, I was informed,

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000
the consent had been obtained.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000
But, in my life,

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:58.000
the one fulfilling skill that I had

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:02.000
was now invoking feelings of conflict --

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000
conflict ranging

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.000
from extreme sorrow and doubt at dawn

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000
to celebratory joy

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:14.000
at engrafting the gift of life at dusk.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000
In my team,

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.000
the lives of one or two of my colleagues

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.000
were tainted by this experience.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.000
Some of us may have been sublimated,

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:29.000
but really none of us remained the same.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.000
I was troubled

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:36.000
that the retrieval of organs from executed prisoners

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.000
was at least as morally controversial

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000
as the harvesting of stem cells

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.000
from human embryos.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000
And in my mind,

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.000
I realized as a surgical pioneer

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.000
that the purpose of my position of influence

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.000
was surely to speak up

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.000
for those who have no influence.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.000
It made me wonder

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000
if there could be a better way --

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.000
a way to circumvent death

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.000
and yet deliver the gift of life

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.000
that might exponentially impact

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.000
millions of patients worldwide.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000
Now just about that time,

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000
the practice of surgery evolved

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.000
from big to small,

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.000
from wide open incisions

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.000
to keyhole procedures,

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.000
tiny incisions.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.000
And in transplantation, concepts shifted

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.000
from whole organs to cells.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.000
In 1988, at the University of Minnesota,

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.000
I participated in a small series

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.000
of whole organ pancreas transplants.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.000
I witnessed the technical difficulty.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.000
And this inspired in my mind

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:50.000
a shift from transplanting whole organs

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.000
to perhaps transplanting cells.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000
I thought to myself,

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.000
why not take the individual cells

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.000
out of the pancreas --

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.000
the cells that secrete insulin to cure diabetes --

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.000
and transplant these cells? --

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.000
technically a much simpler procedure

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:10.000
than having to grapple with the complexities

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.000
of transplanting a whole organ.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000
And at that time,

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.000
stem cell research

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.000
had gained momentum,

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:22.000
following the isolation of the world's first

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.000
human embryonic stem cells

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.000
in the 1990s.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.000
The observation that stem cells, as master cells,

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000
could give rise

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.000
to a whole variety of different cell types --

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000
heart cells, liver cells,

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.000
pancreatic islet cells --

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:41.000
captured the attention of the media

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:44.000
and the imagination of the public.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.000
I too was fascinated

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:49.000
by this new and disruptive cell technology,

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:52.000
and this inspired a shift in my mindset,

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000
from transplanting whole organs

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.000
to transplanting cells.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:00.000
And I focused my research on stem cells

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000
as a possible source

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000
for cell transplants.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.000
Today we realize

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:10.000
that there are many different types of stem cells.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000
Embryonic stem cells

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.000
have occupied center stage,

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:18.000
chiefly because of their pluripotency --

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:21.000
that is their ease in differentiating

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:24.000
into a variety of different cell types.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:28.000
But the moral controversy

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.000
surrounding embryonic stem cells --

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.000
the fact that these cells are derived

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.000
from five-day old human embryos --

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.000
has encouraged research

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:41.000
into other types of stem cells.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:45.000
Now to the ridicule of my colleagues,

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.000
I inspired my lab

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:50.000
to focus on what I thought

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:54.000
was the most non-controversial source of stem cells,

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:57.000
adipose tissue, or fat, yes fat --

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:00.000
nowadays available in abundant supply --

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:05.000
you and I, I think, would be very happy to get rid of anyway.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.000
Fat-derived stem cells

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.000
are adult stem cells.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.000
And adult stem cells

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.000
are found in you and me --

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.000
in our blood, in our bone marrow,

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:19.000
in our fat, our skin and other organs.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.000
And as it turns out,

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.000
fat is one of the best sources

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.000
of adult stem cells.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.000
But adult stem cells

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:30.000
are not embryonic stem cells.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.000
And here is the limitation:

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:35.000
adult stem cells are mature cells,

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:38.000
and, like mature human beings,

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:41.000
these cells are more restricted in their thought

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:44.000
and more restricted in their behavior

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.000
and are unable to give rise

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:49.000
to the wide variety of specialized cell types,

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.000
as embryonic stem cells [can].

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:54.000
But in 2007,

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:57.000
two remarkable individuals,

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.000
Shinya Yamanaka of Japan

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:02.000
and Jamie Thomson of the United States,

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:05.000
made an astounding discovery.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.000
They discovered

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:10.000
that adult cells, taken from you and me,

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:13.000
could be reprogrammed

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.000
back into embryonic-like cells,

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:18.000
which they termed IPS cells,

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:23.000
or induced pluripotent stem cells.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.000
And so guess what,

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:28.000
scientists around the world and in the labs

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.000
are racing

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:33.000
to convert aging adult cells --

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.000
aging adult cells from you and me --

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:38.000
they are racing to reprogram these cells

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:42.000
back into more useful IPS cells.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.000
And in our lab,

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.000
we are focused on taking fat

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.000
and reprogramming

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.000
mounds of fat

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:55.000
into fountains of youthful cells --

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.000
cells that we may use

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.000
to then form other,

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.000
more specialized, cells,

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:04.000
which one day may be used as cell transplants.

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:08.000
If this research is successful,

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:11.000
it may then reduce the need

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.000
to research and sacrifice

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:16.000
human embryos.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:20.000
Indeed, there is a lot of hype, but also hope

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.000
that the promise of stem cells

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.000
will one day provide cures

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.000
for a whole range of conditions.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:29.000
Heart disease, stroke, diabetes,

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.000
spinal cord injury, muscular dystrophy,

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:34.000
retinal eye diseases --

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.000
are any of these conditions

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:39.000
relevant, personally, to you?

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:42.000
In May 2006,

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:45.000
something horrible happened to me.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:47.000
I was about to start a robotic operation,

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.000
but stepping out of the elevator

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:52.000
into the bright and glaring lights of the operating room,

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.000
I realized

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.000
that my left visual field

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:59.000
was fast collapsing into darkness.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.000
Earlier that week,

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.000
I had taken a rather hard knock

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:06.000
during late spring skiing -- yes, I fell.

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.000
And I started to see floaters and stars,

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.000
which I casually dismissed

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:13.000
as too much high-altitude sun exposure.

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:15.000
What happened to me

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:17.000
might have been catastrophic,

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:19.000
if not for the fact

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:21.000
that I was in reach of good surgical access.

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:23.000
And I had my vision restored,

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:26.000
but not before a prolonged period of convalescence --

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.000
three months --

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.000
in a head down position.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.000
This experience

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:35.000
taught me to empathize more with my patients,

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:38.000
and especially those with retinal diseases.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:41.000
37 million people worldwide

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.000
are blind,

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:46.000
and 127 million more

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:49.000
suffer from impaired vision.

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:52.000
Stem cell-derived retinal transplants,

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.000
now in a research phase,

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.000
may one day restore vision,

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.000
or part vision,

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:02.000
to millions of patients with retinal diseases worldwide.

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:04.000
Indeed, we live

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:06.000
in both challenging

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:09.000
as well as exciting times.

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:13.000
As the world population ages,

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:15.000
scientists are racing

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:17.000
to discover new ways

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:19.000
to enhance the power of the body

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:22.000
to heal itself through stem cells.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.000
It is a fact

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:27.000
that when our organs or tissues are injured,

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:29.000
our bone marrow

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:31.000
releases stem cells

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.000
into our circulation.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:35.000
And these stem cells

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:37.000
then float in the bloodstream

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:40.000
and hone in to damaged organs

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:42.000
to release growth factors

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.000
to repair the damaged tissue.

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:47.000
Stem cells may be used as building blocks

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:51.000
to repair damaged scaffolds within our body,

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:53.000
or to provide new liver cells

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:56.000
to repair damaged liver.

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:59.000
As we speak, there are 117 or so clinical trials

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:02.000
researching the use of stem cells

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.000
for liver diseases.

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:06.000
What lies ahead?

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:08.000
Heart disease

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:10.000
is the leading cause of death worldwide.

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:12.000
1.1 million Americans

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:15.000
suffer heart attacks yearly.

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:17.000
4.8 million

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:19.000
suffer cardiac failure.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:21.000
Stem cells may be used

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:23.000
to deliver growth factors

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:25.000
to repair damaged heart muscle

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:27.000
or be differentiated

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:29.000
into heart muscle cells

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:31.000
to restore heart function.

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:34.000
There are 170 clinical trials

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:38.000
investigating the role of stem cells in heart disease.

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:41.000
While still in a research phase,

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:44.000
stem cells may one day herald

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:47.000
a quantum leap in the field of cardiology.

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:51.000
Stem cells provide hope for new beginnings --

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:54.000
small, incremental steps,

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:57.000
cells rather than organs,

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:00.000
repair rather than replacement.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:03.000
Stem cell therapies

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:07.000
may one day reduce the need for donor organs.

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:09.000
Powerful new technologies

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:11.000
always present enigmas.

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:13.000
As we speak,

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:16.000
the world's first human embryonic stem cell trial for spinal cord injury

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:18.000
is currently underway

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:21.000
following the USFDA approval.

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:23.000
And in the U.K.,

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:25.000
neural stem cells to treat stroke

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:28.000
are being investigated in a phase one trial.

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:32.000
The research success that we celebrate today

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:34.000
has been made possible

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:38.000
by the curiosity and contribution and commitment

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:40.000
of individual scientists

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:42.000
and medical pioneers.

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:45.000
Each one has his story.

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:48.000
My story has been about my journey

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:50.000
from organs to cells --

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:52.000
a journey through controversy,

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:54.000
inspired by hope --

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:57.000
hope that, as we age,

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:00.000
you and I may one day celebrate longevity

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:02.000
with an improved quality of life.

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:04.000
Thank you.
