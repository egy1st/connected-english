00:00:01.031 --> 00:00:05.095
My students often ask me,
"What is sociology?"

00:00:05.558 --> 00:00:09.910
And I tell them it's the study of the way
in which human beings are shaped

00:00:09.934 --> 00:00:11.687
by things that they don't see.

00:00:12.501 --> 00:00:15.825
And they say, "So,
how can I be a sociologist?

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:18.778
How can I understand
those invisible forces?"

00:00:18.802 --> 00:00:20.330
And I say, "Empathy.

00:00:20.354 --> 00:00:22.454
Start with empathy.

00:00:22.478 --> 00:00:25.260
It all begins with empathy.

00:00:25.284 --> 00:00:27.040
Take yourself out of your shoes,

00:00:27.064 --> 00:00:29.708
put yourself into the shoes
of another person."

00:00:29.732 --> 00:00:31.362
Here, I'll give you an example.

00:00:32.263 --> 00:00:35.667
So I imagine my life
if, a hundred years ago,

00:00:35.691 --> 00:00:38.541
China had been the most powerful
nation in the world

00:00:38.565 --> 00:00:42.052
and they came to the United States
in search of coal.

00:00:42.076 --> 00:00:45.267
And they found it, and, in fact,
they found lots of it right here.

00:00:45.291 --> 00:00:48.817
And pretty soon,
they began shipping that coal,

00:00:48.841 --> 00:00:50.617
ton by ton,

00:00:50.641 --> 00:00:54.079
railcar by railcar, boatload by boatload,

00:00:54.103 --> 00:00:57.188
back to China and elsewhere
around the world.

00:00:58.069 --> 00:01:00.319
And they got fabulously
wealthy in doing so.

00:01:00.343 --> 00:01:02.676
And they built beautiful cities

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:05.800
all powered on that coal.

00:01:07.612 --> 00:01:11.033
And back here in the United States,

00:01:11.057 --> 00:01:13.204
we saw economic despair, deprivation.

00:01:13.228 --> 00:01:14.676
This is what I saw.

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.331
I saw people struggling to get by,

00:01:17.355 --> 00:01:20.450
not knowing what was what
and what was next.

00:01:20.474 --> 00:01:22.741
And I asked myself the question:

00:01:22.765 --> 00:01:26.095
How is it possible that we could
be so poor here in the United States,

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:29.824
because coal is such a wealthy
resource; it's so much money?

00:01:29.848 --> 00:01:31.008
And I realize:

00:01:31.032 --> 00:01:34.437
because the Chinese ingratiated themselves

00:01:34.461 --> 00:01:37.220
with a small ruling class
here in the United States,

00:01:37.244 --> 00:01:40.782
who stole all of that money
and all of that wealth for themselves.

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.596
And the rest of us,
the vast majority of us,

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:44.885
struggle to get by.

00:01:45.389 --> 00:01:48.493
And the Chinese
gave this small ruling elite

00:01:48.517 --> 00:01:51.886
loads of military weapons
and sophisticated technology

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:54.676
in order to ensure that people like me

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:57.700
would not speak out
against this relationship.

00:01:58.573 --> 00:02:00.009
Does this sound familiar?

00:02:01.445 --> 00:02:04.806
And they did things like train Americans
to help protect the coal.

00:02:05.056 --> 00:02:08.294
And everywhere, there were
symbols of the Chinese --

00:02:08.318 --> 00:02:11.294
everywhere, a constant reminder.

00:02:11.931 --> 00:02:14.074
And back in China,

00:02:14.098 --> 00:02:15.424
what do they say in China?

00:02:15.448 --> 00:02:19.047
Nothing! They don't talk about us.
They don't talk about the coal.

00:02:19.071 --> 00:02:20.261
If you ask them,

00:02:20.285 --> 00:02:22.676
they'll say, "Well, you know,
we need the coal.

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:25.898
I mean, come on, I'm not going
to turn down my thermostat.

00:02:26.422 --> 00:02:27.827
You can't expect that."

00:02:28.374 --> 00:02:31.549
And so, I get angry, and I get pissed,

00:02:31.573 --> 00:02:33.886
as do lots of average people.

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:36.452
And we fight back,
and it gets really ugly.

00:02:36.476 --> 00:02:38.885
And the Chinese respond
in a very ugly way.

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:43.015
And before we know it,
they send in the tanks

00:02:43.039 --> 00:02:44.736
and they send in the troops.

00:02:45.382 --> 00:02:47.030
And lots of people are dying.

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:51.451
And it's a very, very difficult situation.

00:02:52.676 --> 00:02:55.723
Can you imagine what you would feel

00:02:55.747 --> 00:02:57.912
if you were in my shoes?

00:02:57.936 --> 00:03:00.261
Can you imagine
walking out of this building

00:03:00.285 --> 00:03:02.103
and seeing a tank sitting out there,

00:03:02.127 --> 00:03:04.454
or a truck full of soldiers?

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:09.120
Just imagine what you would feel,
because you know why they're here;

00:03:09.144 --> 00:03:10.790
you know what they're doing here.

00:03:10.814 --> 00:03:13.701
And you just feel the anger
and you feel the fear.

00:03:14.374 --> 00:03:17.140
If you can, that's empathy.
That's empathy.

00:03:17.164 --> 00:03:20.343
You've left your shoes,
and you've stood in mine.

00:03:21.138 --> 00:03:22.953
And you've got to feel that.

00:03:22.977 --> 00:03:24.676
OK, so that's the warm-up.

00:03:25.056 --> 00:03:26.228
That's the warm-up.

00:03:26.252 --> 00:03:29.986
Now we're going to have
the real radical experiment.

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:33.676
So, for the remainder of my talk,
what I want you to do

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:38.288
is put yourselves in the shoes
of an ordinary Arab Muslim

00:03:38.312 --> 00:03:40.041
living in the Middle East --

00:03:40.065 --> 00:03:42.191
in particular, in Iraq.

00:03:44.343 --> 00:03:45.626
And so to help you,

00:03:46.271 --> 00:03:50.247
perhaps you're a member
of this middle-class family in Baghdad.

00:03:50.604 --> 00:03:53.298
What you want is the best for your kids.

00:03:53.322 --> 00:03:55.299
You want your kids to have a better life.

00:03:55.323 --> 00:03:57.410
And you watch the news, you pay attention.

00:03:57.434 --> 00:04:00.988
You read the newspaper, you go down
to the coffee shop with your friends,

00:04:01.012 --> 00:04:03.233
you read the newspapers
from around the world.

00:04:03.257 --> 00:04:06.293
Sometimes you even watch satellite,
CNN, from the United States.

00:04:06.317 --> 00:04:08.804
You have a sense of what
the Americans are thinking.

00:04:08.828 --> 00:04:11.876
But really, you just want
a better life for yourself.

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:13.088
That's what you want.

00:04:13.445 --> 00:04:16.509
You're Arab Muslim living in Iraq.

00:04:16.533 --> 00:04:18.280
You want a better life for yourself.

00:04:18.304 --> 00:04:19.518
So here, let me help you.

00:04:19.542 --> 00:04:23.033
Let me help you with some things
that you might be thinking.

00:04:23.057 --> 00:04:24.326
Number one:

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:28.676
this incursion into your land
these past 20 years and before --

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:30.819
the reason anyone
is interested in your land,

00:04:30.843 --> 00:04:32.987
and particularly
the United States, is oil.

00:04:33.011 --> 00:04:36.120
It's all about oil; you know that,
everybody knows that.

00:04:36.144 --> 00:04:39.244
People back in the United States
know it's about oil.

00:04:39.459 --> 00:04:44.557
It's because somebody else
has a design for your resource.

00:04:44.581 --> 00:04:47.134
It's your resource --
it's not somebody else's.

00:04:47.158 --> 00:04:50.136
It's your land; it's your resource.

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:51.833
Somebody else has a design for it.

00:04:52.778 --> 00:04:54.631
And you know why they have a design?

00:04:54.655 --> 00:04:56.752
You know why they have
their eyes set on it?

00:04:56.776 --> 00:04:58.850
Because they have
an entire economic system

00:04:58.874 --> 00:05:02.083
that's dependent
on that oil -- foreign oil,

00:05:02.107 --> 00:05:04.733
oil from other parts of the world
that they don't own.

00:05:05.247 --> 00:05:07.814
And what else do you think
about these people?

00:05:07.838 --> 00:05:09.246
The Americans, they're rich.

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:11.791
Come on, they live in big houses,
they have big cars.

00:05:11.815 --> 00:05:14.215
They all have blond hair,
blue eyes. They're happy.

00:05:14.239 --> 00:05:17.748
You think that. It's not true, of course,
but that's the media impression.

00:05:17.772 --> 00:05:18.968
And that's what you get.

00:05:18.992 --> 00:05:20.200
And they have big cities,

00:05:20.224 --> 00:05:23.327
and the cities are all dependent on oil.

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:26.676
And back home, what do you see?

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:28.724
Poverty, despair, struggle.

00:05:29.216 --> 00:05:31.608
Look, you don't live in a wealthy country.

00:05:31.632 --> 00:05:33.679
I mean -- this is Iraq.

00:05:35.275 --> 00:05:37.188
This is what you see.

00:05:37.212 --> 00:05:39.526
You see people struggling to get by.

00:05:39.873 --> 00:05:41.942
It's not easy; you see a lot of poverty.

00:05:41.966 --> 00:05:43.633
And you feel something about this.

00:05:43.657 --> 00:05:45.754
These people have designs
for your resource,

00:05:45.778 --> 00:05:47.083
and this is what you see?

00:05:47.982 --> 00:05:50.094
Something else you see
that you talk about --

00:05:50.118 --> 00:05:52.328
Americans don't talk
about this, but you do --

00:05:52.352 --> 00:05:54.879
there's this thing,
this militarization of the world,

00:05:54.903 --> 00:05:57.047
and it's centered
right in the United States.

00:05:57.071 --> 00:05:58.945
And the United States is responsible

00:05:58.969 --> 00:06:03.447
for almost one half
of the world's military spending.

00:06:04.264 --> 00:06:06.256
Four percent of the world's population!

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:08.824
And you feel it; you see it every day.

00:06:08.848 --> 00:06:10.170
It's part of your life.

00:06:10.194 --> 00:06:12.972
And you talk about it with your friends.

00:06:12.996 --> 00:06:14.584
You read about it.

00:06:14.608 --> 00:06:17.839
And back when Saddam Hussein was in power,

00:06:18.486 --> 00:06:21.387
the Americans didn't care
about his crimes.

00:06:21.411 --> 00:06:23.828
When he was gassing
the Kurds and gassing Iran,

00:06:23.852 --> 00:06:25.327
they didn't care about it.

00:06:25.351 --> 00:06:27.430
When oil was at stake,

00:06:27.454 --> 00:06:30.914
somehow, suddenly, things mattered.

00:06:32.485 --> 00:06:34.887
And what you see, something else:

00:06:34.911 --> 00:06:36.697
the United States,

00:06:36.721 --> 00:06:38.830
the hub of democracy around the world --

00:06:38.854 --> 00:06:42.493
they don't seem to really be supporting
democratic countries

00:06:42.517 --> 00:06:44.404
all around the world.

00:06:44.428 --> 00:06:47.147
There are a lot of countries,
oil-producing countries,

00:06:47.171 --> 00:06:50.399
that aren't very democratic,
but supported by the United States.

00:06:51.130 --> 00:06:52.293
That's odd.

00:06:52.317 --> 00:06:55.118
Oh -- these incursions, these two wars,

00:06:55.142 --> 00:06:57.454
the 10 years of sanctions,

00:06:57.478 --> 00:07:01.149
the eight years of occupation,

00:07:01.173 --> 00:07:04.827
the insurgency that's been
unleashed on your people,

00:07:04.851 --> 00:07:07.676
the tens of thousands,
the hundreds of thousands

00:07:07.700 --> 00:07:10.164
of civilian deaths?

00:07:12.914 --> 00:07:14.760
All because of oil.

00:07:15.628 --> 00:07:17.144
You can't help but think that.

00:07:17.588 --> 00:07:18.969
You talk about it.

00:07:19.700 --> 00:07:22.176
It's in the forefront
of your mind, always.

00:07:22.700 --> 00:07:24.715
You say, "How is that possible?"

00:07:25.207 --> 00:07:27.628
And this man, he's everyman --

00:07:28.700 --> 00:07:30.751
your grandfather, your uncle,

00:07:30.775 --> 00:07:32.838
your father, your son, your neighbor,

00:07:32.862 --> 00:07:34.507
your professor, your student.

00:07:35.092 --> 00:07:37.971
Once a life of happiness and joy

00:07:37.995 --> 00:07:40.012
and suddenly, pain and sorrow.

00:07:42.100 --> 00:07:48.314
Everyone in your country
has been touched by the violence,

00:07:48.338 --> 00:07:51.423
the bloodshed, the pain,
the horror -- everybody.

00:07:51.447 --> 00:07:56.620
Not a single person in your country
has not been touched.

00:07:57.124 --> 00:07:58.676
But there's something else.

00:07:58.700 --> 00:08:02.676
There's something else about these people,
these Americans who are there.

00:08:02.700 --> 00:08:04.901
There's something else
about them that you see

00:08:04.925 --> 00:08:06.499
that they don't see themselves.

00:08:06.523 --> 00:08:08.675
And what do you see? They're Christians!

00:08:08.699 --> 00:08:10.167
They're Christians.

00:08:10.191 --> 00:08:13.692
They worship the Christian God,
they have crosses, they carry Bibles.

00:08:13.716 --> 00:08:15.874
Their Bibles have a little insignia

00:08:15.898 --> 00:08:18.673
that says "US Army" on them.

00:08:19.700 --> 00:08:22.676
And their leaders, their leaders:

00:08:22.700 --> 00:08:26.993
before they send their sons and daughters
off to war in your country --

00:08:27.017 --> 00:08:28.355
and you know the reason --

00:08:28.379 --> 00:08:29.946
before they send them off,

00:08:29.970 --> 00:08:33.272
they go to a Christian church,
and they pray to their Christian God,

00:08:33.296 --> 00:08:36.080
and they ask for protection
and guidance from that god.

00:08:36.104 --> 00:08:37.281
Why?

00:08:37.305 --> 00:08:41.358
Well, obviously,
when people die in the war,

00:08:41.382 --> 00:08:45.961
they are Muslims, they are Iraqis --
they're not Americans.

00:08:45.985 --> 00:08:48.805
You don't want Americans to die --
"Protect Our Troops."

00:08:48.829 --> 00:08:51.160
And you feel something about that --

00:08:51.184 --> 00:08:52.387
of course you do.

00:08:52.411 --> 00:08:54.338
And they do wonderful things.

00:08:54.362 --> 00:08:56.176
You read about it, you hear about it.

00:08:56.200 --> 00:08:58.418
They're there to build schools
and help people.

00:08:58.442 --> 00:08:59.811
That's what they want to do.

00:08:59.835 --> 00:09:02.603
They do wonderful things,
but they also do the bad things,

00:09:02.627 --> 00:09:04.262
and you can't tell the difference.

00:09:04.286 --> 00:09:07.053
And this guy, you get a guy
like Lt. Gen. William Boykin.

00:09:07.077 --> 00:09:09.574
Here's a guy who says
that your god is a false god.

00:09:09.598 --> 00:09:11.676
Your god's an idol;
his god is the true god.

00:09:11.700 --> 00:09:14.796
The solution to the problem
in the Middle East, according to him,

00:09:14.820 --> 00:09:16.754
is to convert you all to Christianity --

00:09:16.778 --> 00:09:18.234
just get rid of your religion.

00:09:18.700 --> 00:09:21.411
And you know that.
Americans don't read about this guy.

00:09:21.435 --> 00:09:23.676
They don't know anything
about him, but you do.

00:09:23.700 --> 00:09:25.891
You pass it around.
You pass his words around.

00:09:25.915 --> 00:09:28.487
I mean, this is serious. You're afraid.

00:09:28.511 --> 00:09:31.751
He was one of the leading commanders
in the second invasion of Iraq.

00:09:31.775 --> 00:09:34.489
And you're thinking,
"My God, if this guy is saying that,

00:09:34.513 --> 00:09:36.620
then all the soldiers
must be saying that."

00:09:37.112 --> 00:09:38.597
And this word here --

00:09:38.621 --> 00:09:40.534
George Bush called this war a crusade.

00:09:40.558 --> 00:09:43.036
Man, the Americans,
they're just like, "Ah, crusade.

00:09:43.060 --> 00:09:45.006
Whatever. I don't know what that means."

00:09:45.030 --> 00:09:48.055
You know what it means --
it's a holy war against Muslims.

00:09:48.079 --> 00:09:51.908
Look, invade, subdue them,
take their resources.

00:09:51.932 --> 00:09:53.742
If they won't submit, kill them.

00:09:54.205 --> 00:09:55.556
That's what this is about.

00:09:55.580 --> 00:09:59.208
And you're thinking, "My God,
these Christians are coming to kill us."

00:09:59.232 --> 00:10:00.676
This is frightening.

00:10:00.700 --> 00:10:03.454
You feel frightened.
Of course you feel frightened.

00:10:03.478 --> 00:10:06.175
And this man, Terry Jones:

00:10:06.199 --> 00:10:08.946
I mean here's a guy
who wants to burn Qurans, right?

00:10:08.970 --> 00:10:11.623
And the Americans:
"Ah, he's a knucklehead.

00:10:11.647 --> 00:10:15.276
He's a former hotel manager; he's got
three dozen members of his church ..."

00:10:15.300 --> 00:10:16.467
They laugh him off.

00:10:16.491 --> 00:10:19.677
You don't laugh him off,
because in the context of everything else,

00:10:19.701 --> 00:10:20.852
all the pieces fit.

00:10:20.876 --> 00:10:22.760
Of course this is how Americans think.

00:10:22.784 --> 00:10:25.787
So people all over the Middle East,
not just in your country,

00:10:25.811 --> 00:10:26.967
are protesting.

00:10:26.991 --> 00:10:28.922
"He wants to burn Qurans, our holy book.

00:10:28.946 --> 00:10:31.074
These Christians --
who are these Christians?

00:10:31.098 --> 00:10:34.513
They're so evil, they're so mean --
this is what they're about?"

00:10:34.537 --> 00:10:37.152
This is what you're thinking
as an Arab Muslim,

00:10:37.176 --> 00:10:38.585
as an Iraqi.

00:10:38.609 --> 00:10:40.586
Of course you're going to think this.

00:10:40.610 --> 00:10:44.534
And then your cousin says,
"Hey coz, check out this website.

00:10:44.558 --> 00:10:46.832
You've got to see this -- Bible Boot Camp.

00:10:46.856 --> 00:10:48.134
These Christians are nuts!

00:10:48.158 --> 00:10:51.025
They're training their little kids
to be soldiers for Jesus.

00:10:51.049 --> 00:10:53.634
They take little kids
and run them through these things

00:10:53.658 --> 00:10:55.960
till they teach them
how to say, 'Sir! Yes, sir!'

00:10:55.984 --> 00:10:59.096
and things like 'grenade toss'
and 'weapons care and maintenance.'

00:10:59.120 --> 00:11:02.152
And go to the website --
it says 'US Army' right on it.

00:11:02.176 --> 00:11:04.086
I mean, these Christians, they're nuts.

00:11:04.110 --> 00:11:06.120
How can they do this
to their little kids?"

00:11:06.144 --> 00:11:07.675
And you're reading this website.

00:11:07.699 --> 00:11:10.520
And of course, Christians
in the United States, or anybody,

00:11:10.544 --> 00:11:13.425
says, "This is some little church
in the middle of nowhere."

00:11:13.449 --> 00:11:14.600
You don't know that.

00:11:14.624 --> 00:11:17.033
For you, this is like, all Christians.

00:11:17.057 --> 00:11:19.359
It's all over the Web: "Bible Boot Camp."

00:11:19.383 --> 00:11:20.712
And look at this.

00:11:21.157 --> 00:11:22.552
They even teach their kids --

00:11:22.576 --> 00:11:25.389
they train them in the same way
the US Marines train.

00:11:25.907 --> 00:11:27.374
Isn't that interesting.

00:11:27.398 --> 00:11:29.676
And it scares you, and it frightens you.

00:11:29.700 --> 00:11:31.676
So these guys, you see them.

00:11:31.700 --> 00:11:34.884
You see, I, Sam Richards --
I know who these guys are.

00:11:34.908 --> 00:11:37.841
They're my students, my friends;
I know what they're thinking.

00:11:37.865 --> 00:11:39.073
You don't know.

00:11:39.097 --> 00:11:41.642
When you see them, they're something else.

00:11:42.426 --> 00:11:43.700
They're something else.

00:11:44.130 --> 00:11:45.866
That's what they are to you.

00:11:46.908 --> 00:11:49.375
We don't see it that way
in the United States,

00:11:49.399 --> 00:11:50.835
but you see it that way.

00:11:54.700 --> 00:11:55.867
So here.

00:11:56.501 --> 00:11:58.533
Of course, you've got it wrong.

00:11:58.557 --> 00:12:01.040
You're generalizing. It's wrong.

00:12:01.064 --> 00:12:03.351
You don't understand the Americans.

00:12:03.375 --> 00:12:05.055
It's not a Christian invasion.

00:12:05.079 --> 00:12:08.052
We're not just there for oil;
we're there for lots of reasons.

00:12:08.076 --> 00:12:10.089
You have it wrong. You've missed it.

00:12:10.113 --> 00:12:12.890
And of course, most of you
don't support the insurgency;

00:12:12.914 --> 00:12:14.672
you don't support killing Americans;

00:12:14.696 --> 00:12:16.676
you don't support the terrorists.

00:12:16.700 --> 00:12:18.676
Of course you don't. Very few people do.

00:12:18.700 --> 00:12:20.964
But -- some of you do.

00:12:21.972 --> 00:12:23.394
And this is a perspective.

00:12:23.781 --> 00:12:26.513
OK. So now, here's what we're going to do.

00:12:26.537 --> 00:12:30.498
Step outside of your shoes
that you're in right now,

00:12:30.522 --> 00:12:32.312
and step back into your normal shoes.

00:12:32.336 --> 00:12:34.311
So everyone's back in the room. OK?

00:12:35.265 --> 00:12:37.166
Now here comes the radical experiment.

00:12:37.190 --> 00:12:38.547
So we're all back home.

00:12:39.216 --> 00:12:41.308
This photo: this woman --

00:12:41.332 --> 00:12:43.205
man, I feel her.

00:12:43.229 --> 00:12:44.802
I feel her.

00:12:44.826 --> 00:12:46.306
She's my sister,

00:12:46.330 --> 00:12:49.514
my wife, my cousin, my neighbor.

00:12:49.538 --> 00:12:50.934
She's anybody to me.

00:12:50.958 --> 00:12:53.665
These guys standing there,
everybody in the photo --

00:12:53.689 --> 00:12:55.406
I feel this photo, man.

00:12:56.832 --> 00:12:58.467
So here's what I want you to do.

00:12:58.491 --> 00:13:01.543
Let's go back to my first
example, of the Chinese.

00:13:02.500 --> 00:13:04.322
I want you to go there.

00:13:04.346 --> 00:13:07.576
It's all about coal, and the Chinese
are here in the United States.

00:13:07.600 --> 00:13:09.346
What I want you to do is picture her

00:13:09.370 --> 00:13:12.298
as a Chinese woman
receiving a Chinese flag

00:13:12.322 --> 00:13:16.991
because her loved one has died
in America in the coal uprising.

00:13:17.612 --> 00:13:19.241
And the soldiers are Chinese,

00:13:19.265 --> 00:13:21.140
and everybody else is Chinese.

00:13:21.620 --> 00:13:24.620
As an American, how do you feel
about this picture?

00:13:26.930 --> 00:13:28.826
What do you think about that scene?

00:13:31.700 --> 00:13:34.222
OK, try this. Bring it back.

00:13:34.246 --> 00:13:35.676
This is the scene here.

00:13:35.700 --> 00:13:37.566
It's an American, American soldiers,

00:13:37.590 --> 00:13:40.645
American woman who lost
her loved one in the Middle East,

00:13:40.669 --> 00:13:42.872
in Iraq or Afghanistan.

00:13:42.896 --> 00:13:44.872
Now, put yourself in the shoes,

00:13:44.896 --> 00:13:48.751
go back to the shoes
of an Arab Muslim living in Iraq.

00:13:51.005 --> 00:13:55.803
What are you feeling and thinking
about this photo,

00:13:55.827 --> 00:13:57.640
about this woman?

00:14:06.001 --> 00:14:07.676
OK,

00:14:07.700 --> 00:14:09.676
now follow me on this,

00:14:09.700 --> 00:14:11.831
because I'm taking a big risk here.

00:14:11.855 --> 00:14:14.594
And so I'm going to invite you
to take a risk with me.

00:14:14.618 --> 00:14:16.595
These gentlemen here, they're insurgents.

00:14:16.619 --> 00:14:20.628
They were caught by the American soldiers,
trying to kill Americans.

00:14:20.652 --> 00:14:24.062
And maybe they succeeded.
Maybe they succeeded.

00:14:24.086 --> 00:14:28.460
Put yourself in the shoes
of the Americans who caught them.

00:14:29.207 --> 00:14:31.287
Can you feel the rage?

00:14:31.311 --> 00:14:33.693
Can you feel that you just want
to take these guys

00:14:33.717 --> 00:14:35.167
and wring their necks?

00:14:35.191 --> 00:14:36.441
Can you go there?

00:14:37.335 --> 00:14:39.010
It shouldn't be that difficult.

00:14:39.389 --> 00:14:42.338
You just -- oh, man.

00:14:43.274 --> 00:14:48.445
Now, put yourself in their shoes.

00:14:50.771 --> 00:14:52.748
Are they brutal killers

00:14:52.772 --> 00:14:54.725
or patriotic defenders?

00:14:56.701 --> 00:14:57.854
Which one?

00:14:58.491 --> 00:15:01.676
Can you feel their anger,

00:15:01.700 --> 00:15:03.131
their fear,

00:15:03.155 --> 00:15:05.131
their rage

00:15:05.824 --> 00:15:08.021
at what has happened in their country?

00:15:08.045 --> 00:15:12.448
Can you imagine that maybe
one of them, in the morning,

00:15:12.472 --> 00:15:15.604
bent down to their child
and hugged their child

00:15:15.628 --> 00:15:19.605
and said, "Dear, I'll be back later.

00:15:19.629 --> 00:15:22.958
I'm going out to defend
your freedom, your lives.

00:15:22.982 --> 00:15:25.455
I'm going out to look out for us,

00:15:26.469 --> 00:15:27.993
the future of our country."

00:15:29.080 --> 00:15:30.377
Can you imagine that?

00:15:30.401 --> 00:15:31.904
Can you imagine saying that?

00:15:33.128 --> 00:15:34.544
Can you go there?

00:15:37.700 --> 00:15:39.435
What do you think they're feeling?

00:15:47.723 --> 00:15:49.128
You see, that's empathy.

00:15:49.882 --> 00:15:51.326
It's also understanding.

00:15:51.350 --> 00:15:52.978
[understand]

00:15:53.002 --> 00:15:54.310
Now, you might ask,

00:15:54.334 --> 00:15:57.601
"OK, Sam, so why do you
do this sort of thing?

00:15:57.625 --> 00:15:59.985
Why would you use
this example of all examples?"

00:16:00.009 --> 00:16:02.676
And I say, because.

00:16:02.700 --> 00:16:04.501
You're allowed to hate these people.

00:16:04.525 --> 00:16:09.676
You're allowed to just hate them
with every fiber of your being.

00:16:09.700 --> 00:16:13.477
And if I can get you
to step into their shoes

00:16:13.501 --> 00:16:17.058
and walk an inch -- one tiny inch --

00:16:17.880 --> 00:16:20.594
then imagine the kind
of sociological analysis

00:16:20.618 --> 00:16:24.236
that you can do in all other
aspects of your life.

00:16:25.268 --> 00:16:26.676
You can walk a mile

00:16:26.700 --> 00:16:31.771
when it comes to understanding why
that person's driving 40 miles per hour

00:16:31.795 --> 00:16:33.192
in the passing lane;

00:16:33.993 --> 00:16:35.664
or your teenage son;

00:16:36.374 --> 00:16:40.017
or your neighbor who annoys you
by cutting his lawn on Sunday mornings.

00:16:40.041 --> 00:16:42.897
Whatever it is, you can go so far.

00:16:43.501 --> 00:16:45.596
And this is what I tell my students:

00:16:45.620 --> 00:16:49.112
step outside of your tiny, little world.

00:16:49.136 --> 00:16:53.648
Step inside of the tiny,
little world of somebody else.

00:16:53.889 --> 00:16:55.330
And then do it again

00:16:55.354 --> 00:16:57.053
and do it again and do it again.

00:16:57.077 --> 00:16:59.186
And suddenly, all these tiny,
little worlds,

00:16:59.210 --> 00:17:01.462
they come together in this complex web.

00:17:01.486 --> 00:17:04.556
And they build a big, complex world.

00:17:04.580 --> 00:17:06.959
And suddenly, without realizing it,

00:17:06.983 --> 00:17:09.160
you're seeing the world differently.

00:17:09.184 --> 00:17:10.947
Everything has changed.

00:17:10.971 --> 00:17:12.714
Everything in your life has changed.

00:17:13.821 --> 00:17:16.894
And that's, of course, what this is about.

00:17:16.918 --> 00:17:20.040
Attend to other lives,

00:17:20.064 --> 00:17:21.422
other visions.

00:17:21.446 --> 00:17:23.871
Listen to other people,

00:17:23.895 --> 00:17:25.740
enlighten ourselves.

00:17:26.509 --> 00:17:30.136
I'm not saying that I support
the terrorists in Iraq.

00:17:30.779 --> 00:17:34.010
But as a sociologist, what I am saying is:

00:17:34.700 --> 00:17:37.449
I understand.

00:17:38.700 --> 00:17:42.928
And now perhaps -- perhaps -- you do, too.

00:17:42.952 --> 00:17:44.104
Thank you.

00:17:44.128 --> 00:17:47.007
(Applause)
