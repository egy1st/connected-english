00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
So it's 1995,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
I'm in college,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
and a friend and I go on a road trip

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
from Providence, Rhode Island

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
to Portland, Oregon.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
And you know, we're young and unemployed,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
so we do the whole thing on back roads

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
through state parks

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
and national forests --

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
basically the longest route we can possibly take.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
And somewhere in the middle of South Dakota,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
I turn to my friend

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
and I ask her a question

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
that's been bothering me

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
for 2,000 miles.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
"What's up with the Chinese character I keep seeing by the side of the road?"

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000
My friend looks at me totally blankly.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
There's actually a gentleman in the front row

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
who's doing a perfect imitation of her look.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
(Laughter)

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
And I'm like, "You know,

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
all the signs we keep seeing

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
with the Chinese character on them."

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
She just stares at me for a few moments,

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
and then she cracks up,

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
because she figures out what I'm talking about.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
And what I'm talking about is this.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:24.000
(Laughter)

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000
Right, the famous Chinese character for picnic area.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
(Laughter)

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.000
I've spent the last five years of my life

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
thinking about situations

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
exactly like this --

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
why we sometimes misunderstand

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
the signs around us,

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
and how we behave when that happens,

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.000
and what all of this can tell us about human nature.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
In other words, as you heard Chris say,

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
I've spent the last five years

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
thinking about being wrong.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
This might strike you as a strange career move,

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
but it actually has one great advantage:

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
no job competition.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
(Laughter)

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
In fact, most of us do everything we can

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
to avoid thinking about being wrong,

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
or at least to avoid thinking about the possibility

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
that we ourselves are wrong.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
We get it in the abstract.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
We all know everybody in this room makes mistakes.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000
The human species, in general, is fallible -- okay fine.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
But when it comes down to me, right now,

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
to all the beliefs I hold,

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000
here in the present tense,

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.000
suddenly all of this abstract appreciation of fallibility

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000
goes out the window --

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000
and I can't actually think of anything I'm wrong about.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000
And the thing is, the present tense is where we live.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
We go to meetings in the present tense;

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
we go on family vacations in the present tense;

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.000
we go to the polls and vote in the present tense.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
So effectively, we all kind of wind up traveling through life,

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
trapped in this little bubble

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000
of feeling very right about everything.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
I think this is a problem.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000
I think it's a problem for each of us as individuals,

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000
in our personal and professional lives,

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000
and I think it's a problem for all of us collectively as a culture.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
So what I want to do today

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000
is, first of all, talk about why we get stuck

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
inside this feeling of being right.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000
And second, why it's such a problem.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000
And finally, I want to convince you

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
that it is possible

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000
to step outside of that feeling

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000
and that if you can do so,

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000
it is the single greatest

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.000
moral, intellectual and creative leap you can make.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000
So why do we get stuck

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000
in this feeling of being right?

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.000
One reason, actually, has to do with a feeling of being wrong.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000
So let me ask you guys something --

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:55.000
or actually, let me ask you guys something, because you're right here:

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.000
How does it feel -- emotionally --

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000
how does it feel to be wrong?

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.000
Dreadful. Thumbs down.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000
Embarrassing. Okay, wonderful, great.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000
Dreadful, thumbs down, embarrassing --

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.000
thank you, these are great answers,

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.000
but they're answers to a different question.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000
You guys are answering the question:

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.000
How does it feel to realize you're wrong?

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:23.000
(Laughter)

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.000
Realizing you're wrong can feel like all of that and a lot of other things, right?

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.000
I mean it can be devastating, it can be revelatory,

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000
it can actually be quite funny,

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.000
like my stupid Chinese character mistake.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.000
But just being wrong

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000
doesn't feel like anything.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.000
I'll give you an analogy.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000
Do you remember that Loony Tunes cartoon

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000
where there's this pathetic coyote

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000
who's always chasing and never catching a roadrunner?

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.000
In pretty much every episode of this cartoon,

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000
there's a moment where the coyote is chasing the roadrunner

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000
and the roadrunner runs off a cliff,

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.000
which is fine -- he's a bird, he can fly.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:02.000
But the thing is, the coyote runs off the cliff right after him.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000
And what's funny --

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000
at least if you're six years old --

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000
is that the coyote's totally fine too.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000
He just keeps running --

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000
right up until the moment that he looks down

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.000
and realizes that he's in mid-air.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000
That's when he falls.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000
When we're wrong about something --

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.000
not when we realize it, but before that --

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.000
we're like that coyote

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000
after he's gone off the cliff and before he looks down.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.000
You know, we're already wrong,

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000
we're already in trouble,

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.000
but we feel like we're on solid ground.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.000
So I should actually correct something I said a moment ago.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.000
It does feel like something to be wrong;

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.000
it feels like being right.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.000
(Laughter)

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.000
So this is one reason, a structural reason,

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000
why we get stuck inside this feeling of rightness.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.000
I call this error blindness.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000
Most of the time,

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.000
we don't have any kind of internal cue

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.000
to let us know that we're wrong about something,

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.000
until it's too late.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.000
But there's a second reason that we get stuck inside this feeling as well --

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000
and this one is cultural.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.000
Think back for a moment to elementary school.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000
You're sitting there in class,

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.000
and your teacher is handing back quiz papers,

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.000
and one of them looks like this.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000
This is not mine, by the way.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000
(Laughter)

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.000
So there you are in grade school,

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000
and you know exactly what to think

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.000
about the kid who got this paper.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:40.000
It's the dumb kid, the troublemaker,

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:43.000
the one who never does his homework.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:46.000
So by the time you are nine years old,

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.000
you've already learned, first of all,

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.000
that people who get stuff wrong

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.000
are lazy, irresponsible dimwits --

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000
and second of all,

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.000
that the way to succeed in life

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.000
is to never make any mistakes.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:05.000
We learn these really bad lessons really well.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.000
And a lot of us --

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:12.000
and I suspect, especially a lot of us in this room --

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.000
deal with them by just becoming

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.000
perfect little A students,

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:19.000
perfectionists, over-achievers.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.000
Right,

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:25.000
Mr. CFO, astrophysicist, ultra-marathoner?

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:32.000
(Laughter)

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:36.000
You're all CFO, astrophysicists, ultra-marathoners, it turns out.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.000
Okay, so fine.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:41.000
Except that then we freak out

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.000
at the possibility that we've gotten something wrong.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:46.000
Because according to this,

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.000
getting something wrong

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:51.000
means there's something wrong with us.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.000
So we just insist that we're right,

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.000
because it makes us feel smart and responsible

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:58.000
and virtuous and safe.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.000
So let me tell you a story.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.000
A couple of years ago,

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.000
a woman comes into Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center for a surgery.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.000
Beth Israel's in Boston.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.000
It's the teaching hospital for Harvard --

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000
one of the best hospitals in the country.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.000
So this woman comes in and she's taken into the operating room.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.000
She's anesthetized, the surgeon does his thing --

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:20.000
stitches her back up, sends her out to the recovery room.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:23.000
Everything seems to have gone fine.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:26.000
And she wakes up, and she looks down at herself,

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:30.000
and she says, "Why is the wrong side of my body in bandages?"

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.000
Well the wrong side of her body is in bandages

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.000
because the surgeon has performed a major operation

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:38.000
on her left leg instead of her right one.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.000
When the vice president for health care quality at Beth Israel

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.000
spoke about this incident,

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:48.000
he said something very interesting.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.000
He said, "For whatever reason,

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.000
the surgeon simply felt

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.000
that he was on the correct side of the patient."

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:58.000
(Laughter)

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000
The point of this story

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:05.000
is that trusting too much in the feeling

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:08.000
of being on the correct side of anything

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:11.000
can be very dangerous.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:14.000
This internal sense of rightness

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.000
that we all experience so often

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.000
is not a reliable guide

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:21.000
to what is actually going on in the external world.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.000
And when we act like it is,

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:27.000
and we stop entertaining the possibility that we could be wrong,

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.000
well that's when we end up doing things

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:33.000
like dumping 200 million gallons of oil into the Gulf of Mexico,

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:36.000
or torpedoing the global economy.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:40.000
So this is a huge practical problem.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:43.000
But it's also a huge social problem.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:47.000
Think for a moment about what it means to feel right.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.000
It means that you think that your beliefs

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:52.000
just perfectly reflect reality.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.000
And when you feel that way,

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.000
you've got a problem to solve,

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.000
which is, how are you going to explain

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:01.000
all of those people who disagree with you?

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:04.000
It turns out, most of us explain those people the same way,

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:07.000
by resorting to a series of unfortunate assumptions.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:11.000
The first thing we usually do when someone disagrees with us

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:14.000
is we just assume they're ignorant.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.000
They don't have access to the same information that we do,

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:19.000
and when we generously share that information with them,

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:22.000
they're going to see the light and come on over to our team.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:25.000
When that doesn't work,

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.000
when it turns out those people have all the same facts that we do

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.000
and they still disagree with us,

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.000
then we move on to a second assumption,

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:33.000
which is that they're idiots.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.000
(Laughter)

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.000
They have all the right pieces of the puzzle,

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:40.000
and they are too moronic to put them together correctly.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.000
And when that doesn't work,

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:45.000
when it turns out that people who disagree with us

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.000
have all the same facts we do

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:50.000
and are actually pretty smart,

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:53.000
then we move on to a third assumption:

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:56.000
they know the truth,

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.000
and they are deliberately distorting it

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:01.000
for their own malevolent purposes.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:04.000
So this is a catastrophe.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:07.000
This attachment to our own rightness

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.000
keeps us from preventing mistakes

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.000
when we absolutely need to

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:14.000
and causes us to treat each other terribly.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.000
But to me, what's most baffling

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:20.000
and most tragic about this

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:24.000
is that it misses the whole point of being human.

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.000
It's like we want to imagine

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:29.000
that our minds are just these perfectly translucent windows

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.000
and we just gaze out of them

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:34.000
and describe the world as it unfolds.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.000
And we want everybody else to gaze out of the same window

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.000
and see the exact same thing.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.000
That is not true,

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:43.000
and if it were, life would be incredibly boring.

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:46.000
The miracle of your mind

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:49.000
isn't that you can see the world as it is.

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:53.000
It's that you can see the world as it isn't.

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.000
We can remember the past,

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:59.000
and we can think about the future,

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.000
and we can imagine what it's like

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:04.000
to be some other person in some other place.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.000
And we all do this a little differently,

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.000
which is why we can all look up at the same night sky

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.000
and see this

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.000
and also this

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:15.000
and also this.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:18.000
And yeah, it is also why we get things wrong.

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:21.000
1,200 years before Descartes said his famous thing

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:23.000
about "I think therefore I am,"

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:25.000
this guy, St. Augustine, sat down

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:28.000
and wrote "Fallor ergo sum" --

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:32.000
"I err therefore I am."

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.000
Augustine understood

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.000
that our capacity to screw up,

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.000
it's not some kind of embarrassing defect

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.000
in the human system,

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:43.000
something we can eradicate or overcome.

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:46.000
It's totally fundamental to who we are.

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.000
Because, unlike God,

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:51.000
we don't really know what's going on out there.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:54.000
And unlike all of the other animals,

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:58.000
we are obsessed with trying to figure it out.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.000
To me, this obsession

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.000
is the source and root

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:05.000
of all of our productivity and creativity.

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:08.000
Last year, for various reasons,

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:10.000
I found myself listening to a lot of episodes

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.000
of the Public Radio show This American Life.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:15.000
And so I'm listening and I'm listening,

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:18.000
and at some point, I start feeling

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:21.000
like all the stories are about being wrong.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.000
And my first thought was,

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.000
"I've lost it.

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:28.000
I've become the crazy wrongness lady.

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.000
I just imagined it everywhere,"

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.000
which has happened.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.000
But a couple of months later,

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:36.000
I actually had a chance to interview Ira Glass, who's the host of the show.

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.000
And I mentioned this to him,

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:41.000
and he was like, "No actually, that's true.

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:43.000
In fact," he says,

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:45.000
"as a staff, we joke

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.000
that every single episode of our show

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:50.000
has the same crypto-theme.

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.000
And the crypto-theme is:

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:55.000
'I thought this one thing was going to happen

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:58.000
and something else happened instead.'

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:01.000
And the thing is," says Ira Glass, "we need this.

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:03.000
We need these moments

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:05.000
of surprise and reversal and wrongness

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:07.000
to make these stories work."

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:09.000
And for the rest of us, audience members,

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:12.000
as listeners, as readers,

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:14.000
we eat this stuff up.

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:17.000
We love things like plot twists

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:20.000
and red herrings and surprise endings.

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:23.000
When it comes to our stories,

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:26.000
we love being wrong.

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.000
But, you know, our stories are like this

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:31.000
because our lives are like this.

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:34.000
We think this one thing is going to happen

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:37.000
and something else happens instead.

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.000
George Bush thought he was going to invade Iraq,

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:41.000
find a bunch of weapons of mass destruction,

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:44.000
liberate the people and bring democracy to the Middle East.

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:47.000
And something else happened instead.

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:50.000
And Hosni Mubarak

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:52.000
thought he was going to be the dictator of Egypt for the rest of his life,

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:54.000
until he got too old or too sick

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:57.000
and could pass the reigns of power onto his son.

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:00.000
And something else happened instead.

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.000
And maybe you thought

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:05.000
you were going to grow up and marry your high school sweetheart

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:08.000
and move back to your hometown and raise a bunch of kids together.

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:12.000
And something else happened instead.

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:14.000
And I have to tell you

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:16.000
that I thought I was writing an incredibly nerdy book

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:18.000
about a subject everybody hates

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:21.000
for an audience that would never materialize.

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:23.000
And something else happened instead.

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:25.000
(Laughter)

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:27.000
I mean, this is life.

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:29.000
For good and for ill,

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:32.000
we generate these incredible stories

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:34.000
about the world around us,

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:37.000
and then the world turns around and astonishes us.

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:43.000
No offense, but this entire conference

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:45.000
is an unbelievable monument

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:47.000
to our capacity to get stuff wrong.

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:49.000
We just spent an entire week

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:51.000
talking about innovations and advancements

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:53.000
and improvements,

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:56.000
but you know why we need all of those innovations

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:58.000
and advancements and improvements?

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:00.000
Because half the stuff

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:03.000
that's the most mind-boggling and world-altering --

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:05.000
TED 1998 --

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:07.000
eh.

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:11.000
(Laughter)

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:13.000
Didn't really work out that way, did it?

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:15.000
(Laughter)

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:18.000
Where's my jet pack, Chris?

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:22.000
(Laughter)

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:27.000
(Applause)

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:30.000
So here we are again.

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:32.000
And that's how it goes.

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:34.000
We come up with another idea.

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:37.000
We tell another story.

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:40.000
We hold another conference.

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:42.000
The theme of this one,

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:44.000
as you guys have now heard seven million times,

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:46.000
is the rediscovery of wonder.

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:48.000
And to me,

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:51.000
if you really want to rediscover wonder,

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:53.000
you need to step outside

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:59.000
of that tiny, terrified space of rightness

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:02.000
and look around at each other

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:05.000
and look out at the vastness

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:08.000
and complexity and mystery

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:11.000
of the universe

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:14.000
and be able to say,

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:18.000
"Wow, I don't know.

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:20.000
Maybe I'm wrong."

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:22.000
Thank you.

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:25.000
(Applause)

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:27.000
Thank you guys.

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:30.000
(Applause)
