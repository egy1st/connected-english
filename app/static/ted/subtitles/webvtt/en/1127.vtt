WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
I'm very fortunate to be here.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
I feel so fortunate.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
I've been so impressed by the kindness expressed to me.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
I called my wife Leslie,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
and I said, "You know, there's so many good people

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
trying to do so much good.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
It feels like I've landed in a colony of angels."

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
It's a true feeling.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
But let me get to the talk -- I see the clock is running.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
I'm a public school teacher,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
and I just want to share a story of my superintendent.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Her name is Pam Moran

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
in Albemarle County, Virginia,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
And she's a very high-tech superintendent.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
She uses smart boards, she blogs,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
she Tweets, she does Facebook,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
she does all this sort of high-tech stuff.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
She's a technology leader and instructional leader.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
But in her office,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
there's this old wooden, weather-worn table, kitchen table --

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
peeling green paint, it's kind of rickety.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
And I said, "Pam, you're such a modern, cutting-edge person.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
Why is this old table in your office?"

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
And she told me, she said,

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
"You know, I grew up in Southwestern Virginia,

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
in the coal mines and the farmlands of rural Virginia,

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.000
and this table was in my grandfather's kitchen.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
And we'd come in from playing, he'd come in from plowing and working,

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
and we'd sit around that table every night.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
And as I grew up, I heard so much knowledge

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
and so many insights and so much wisdom

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
come out around this table,

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
I began to call it the wisdom table.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
And when he passed on, I took this table with me and brought it to my office,

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
and it reminds me of him.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.000
It reminds me of what goes on around an empty space sometimes."

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
The project I'm going to tell you about

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
is called the World Peace Game,

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
and essentially it is also an empty space.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
And I'd like to think of it

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.000
as a 21st century wisdom table, really.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.000
It all started back in 1977.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
I was a young man,

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:05.000
and I had been dropping in and out of college.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000
And my parents were very patient,

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
but I had been doing intermittent sojourns to India

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
on a mystical quest.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
And I remember the last time I came back from India --

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
in my long white flowing robes

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000
and my big beard and my John Lennon glasses --

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
and I said to my father,

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
"Dad, I think I've just about found spiritual enlightenment."

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
He said, "Well there's one more thing you need to find."

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
I said, "What is that, dad?" "A job."

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
(Laughter)

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000
And so they pleaded with me to get a degree in something.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
So I got a degree

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
and it turned out to be education.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
It was an experimental education program.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
It could have been dentistry, but the word "experimental" was in it,

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000
and so that's what I had to go for.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000
And I went in for a job interview

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000
in the Richmond Public Schools in Virginia, the capital city,

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.000
bought a three-piece suit -- my concession to convention --

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
kept my long beard and my afro

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
and my platform shoes -- at the time it was the '70s --

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
and I walked in, and I sat down and had an interview.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000
And I guess they were hard up for teachers

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000
because the supervisor, her name was Anna Aro,

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000
said I had the job teaching gifted children.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000
And I was so shocked, so stunned,

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000
I got up and said, "Well, thank you, but what do I do?"

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000
(Laughter)

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
Gifted education hadn't really taken hold too much.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000
There weren't really many materials or things to use.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
And I said, "What do I do?"

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.000
And her answer shocked me. It stunned me.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
Her answer set the template

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.000
for the entire career I was to have after that.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:39.000
She said, "What do you want to do?"

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000
And that question cleared the space.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000
There was no program directive, no manual to follow,

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000
no standards in gifted education

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000
in that way.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000
And she cleared such a space

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000
that I endeavored from then on

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
to clear a space for my students, an empty space,

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
whereby they could create and make meaning

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.000
out of their own understanding.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000
So this happened in 1978,

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000
and I was teaching many years later,

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000
and a friend of mine introduced me to a young filmmaker.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000
His name is Chris Farina.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000
Chris Farina is here today at his own cost.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000
Chris, could you stand up and let them see you --

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.000
a young, visionary filmmaker who's made a film.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:25.000
(Applause)

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.000
This film is called "World Peace and Other 4th Grade Achievements."

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000
He proposed the film to me -- it's a great title.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000
He proposed the film to me,

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000
and I said, "Yeah, maybe it'll be on local TV,

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000
and we can say hi to our friends."

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000
But the film has really gone places.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.000
Now it's still in debt, but Chris has managed, through his own sacrifice,

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000
to get this film out.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000
So we made a film

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.000
and it turns out to be more than a story about me,

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000
more than a story about one teacher.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:55.000
It's a story that's a testament to teaching and teachers.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000
And it's a beautiful thing.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000
And the strange thing is, when I watch the film --

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000
I have the eerie sensation of seeing it --

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000
I saw myself literally disappear.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000
What I saw

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.000
was my teachers coming through me.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.000
I saw my geometry teacher in high school, Mr. Rucell's

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.000
wry smile under his handlebar mustache.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.000
That's the smile I use -- that's his smile.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.000
I saw Jan Polo's flashing eyes.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000
And they weren't flashing in anger,

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000
they were flashing in love, intense love for her students.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000
And I have that kind of flash sometimes.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.000
And I saw Miss Ethel J. Banks

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:40.000
who wore pearls and high-heels to elementary school every day.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.000
And you know, she had that old-school teacher stare.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000
You know the one.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.000
(Laughter)

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000
"And I'm not even talking about you behind me,

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000
because I've got eyes in the back of my head."

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.000
(Laughter)

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000
You know that teacher?

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000
I didn't use that stare very often,

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000
but I do have it in my repertoire.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.000
And Miss Banks was there as a great mentor for me.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000
And then I saw

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.000
my own parents, my first teachers.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.000
My father, very inventive, spatial thinker.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.000
That's my brother Malcolm there on the right.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.000
And my mother,

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.000
who taught me in fourth grade

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.000
in segregated schools in Virginia,

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.000
who was my inspiration.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000
And really, I feel as though,

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000
when I see the film --

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.000
I have a gesture she does, like this --

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:37.000
I feel like I am a continuation of her gesture.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000
I am one of her teaching gestures.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.000
And the beautiful thing was,

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.000
I got to teach my daughter in elementary school, Madeline.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.000
And so that gesture of my mother's

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.000
continues through many generations.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.000
It's an amazing feeling

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.000
to have that lineage.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000
And so I'm here standing on the shoulders of many people.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000
I'm not here alone.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.000
There are many people on this stage right now.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:04.000
And so this World Peace Game I'd like to tell you about.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.000
It started out like this:

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.000
it's just a four-foot by five-foot plywood board

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.000
in an inner-city urban school, 1978.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.000
I was creating a lesson for students on Africa.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.000
We put all the problems of the world there,

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.000
and I thought, let's let them solve it.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.000
I didn't want to lecture or have just book reading.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.000
I wanted to have them be immersed

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:27.000
and learn the feeling of learning through their bodies.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000
So I thought, well they like to play games.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000
I'll make something -- I didn't say interactive;

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.000
we didn't have that term in 1978 --

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.000
but something interactive.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.000
And so we made the game,

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.000
and it has since evolved

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.000
to a four-foot by four-foot by four-foot

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:45.000
Plexiglass structure.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.000
And it has four Plexiglass layers.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.000
There's an outer space layer

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000
with black holes and satellites

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000
and research satellites and asteroid mining.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.000
There's an air and space level

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.000
with clouds that are big puffs of cotton we push around

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000
and territorial air spaces and air forces,

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.000
a ground and sea level with thousands of game pieces on it --

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.000
even an undersea level

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.000
with submarines and undersea mining.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.000
There are four countries around the board.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:12.000
The kids make up the names of the countries -- some are rich; some are poor.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.000
They have different assets, commercial and military.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.000
And each country has a cabinet.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.000
There's a Prime Minister, Secretary of State, Minister of Defense

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:22.000
and a CFO, or Comptroller.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:25.000
I choose the Prime Minister based on my relationship with them.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.000
I offer them the job, they can turn it down,

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.000
and then they choose their own cabinet.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:32.000
There's a World Bank, arms dealers and a United Nations.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.000
There's also a weather goddess

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:37.000
who controls a random stock market and random weather.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.000
(Laughter)

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.000
That's not all.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.000
And then there's a 13-page crisis document

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.000
with 50 interlocking problems.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:48.000
So that, if one thing changes, everything else changes.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.000
I throw them into this complex matrix,

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:55.000
and they trust me because we have a deep, rich relationship together.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.000
And so with all these crises,

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:01.000
we have -- let's see -- ethnic and minority tensions;

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.000
we have chemical and nuclear spills,

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.000
nuclear proliferation.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:08.000
There's oil spills, environmental disasters,

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:11.000
water rights disputes, breakaway republics,

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.000
famine, endangered species and global warming.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.000
If Al Gore is here,

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:18.000
I'm going to send my fourth-graders from Agnor-Hurt and Venable schools to you

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:21.000
because they solved global warming in a week.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.000
(Laughter)

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:26.000
(Applause)

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:29.000
And they've done it several times too.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.000
(Laughter)

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:34.000
So I also have in the game a saboteur --

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:37.000
some child -- it's basically a troublemaker --

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:40.000
and I have my troublemaker put to use

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.000
because they, on the surface,

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:44.000
are trying to save the world and their position in the game.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:47.000
But they're also trying to undermine everything in the game.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.000
And they do it secretly through misinformation

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.000
and ambiguities and irrelevancies,

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.000
trying to cause everyone to think more deeply.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.000
The saboteur is there,

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.000
and we also read from Sun Tzu's "The Art of War."

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:01.000
Fourth-graders understand it -- nine years old --

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.000
and they handle that and use that

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.000
to understand how to, not follow --

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.000
at first they do --

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.000
the paths to power and destruction,

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.000
the path to war.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.000
They learn to overlook short-sighted reactions

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.000
and impulsive thinking,

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:19.000
to think in a long-term, more consequential way.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:22.000
Stewart Brand is here, and one of the ideas for this game came from him

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.000
with a CoEvolution Quarterly article

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.000
on a peace force.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:29.000
And in the game, sometimes students actually form a peace force.

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:32.000
I'm just a clock watcher.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.000
I'm just a clarifier. I'm just a facilitator.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.000
The students run the game.

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.000
I have no chance to make any policy whatsoever

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.000
once they start playing.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:43.000
So I'll just share with you ...

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.000
(Video) Boy: The World Peace Game is serious.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:48.000
You're actually getting taught something like how to take care of the world.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.000
See, Mr. Hunter is doing that

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.000
because he says his time has messed up a lot,

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:54.000
and he's trying to tell us

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.000
how to fix that problem.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.000
John Hunter: I offered them a --

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:01.000
(Applause)

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:04.000
Actually, I can't tell them anything because I don't know the answer.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:07.000
And I admit the truth to them right up front: I don't know.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:10.000
And because I don't know, they've got to dig up the answer.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.000
And so I apologize to them as well.

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:15.000
I say, "I'm so sorry, boys and girls,

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.000
but the truth is

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:20.000
we have left this world to you in such a sad and terrible shape,

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.000
and we hope you can fix it for us,

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.000
and maybe this game will help you learn how to do it."

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.000
It's a sincere apology,

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.000
and they take it very seriously.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:31.000
Now you may be wondering what all this complexity looks like.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:34.000
Well when we have the game start, here's what you see.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:37.000
(Video) JH: All right, we're going into negotiations as of now. Go.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:44.000
(Chatter)

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:48.000
JH: My question to you is, who's in charge of that classroom?

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:52.000
It's a serious question: who is really in charge?

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.000
I've learned to cede control of the classroom

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.000
over to the students over time.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.000
There's a trust and an understanding

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.000
and a dedication to an ideal

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.000
that I simply don't have to do

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.000
what I thought I had to do as a beginning teacher:

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:07.000
control every conversation and response in the classroom.

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:09.000
It's impossible. Their collective wisdom

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:11.000
is much greater than mine,

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:14.000
and I admit it to them openly.

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:17.000
So I'll just share with you some stories very quickly

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:20.000
of some magical things that have happened.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:23.000
In this game we had a little girl,

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:26.000
and she was the Defense Minister of the poorest nation.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:30.000
And the Defense Minister -- she had the tank corps and Air Force and so forth.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:33.000
And she was next door to a very wealthy, oil-rich neighbor.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:35.000
Without provocation,

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:38.000
suddenly she attacked, against her Prime Minister's orders,

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.000
the next-door neighbor's oil fields.

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:42.000
She marched into the oil field reserves,

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:44.000
surrounded it, without firing a shot,

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:46.000
and secured it and held it.

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.000
And that neighbor was unable to conduct any military operations

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:51.000
because their fuel supply was locked up.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.000
We were all upset with her, "Why are you doing this?

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.000
This is the World Peace Game. What is wrong with you?"

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.000
(Laughter)

00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:59.000
This was a little girl and, at nine years old,

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:02.000
she held her pieces and said, "I know what I'm doing."

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:05.000
To her girlfriends she said that.

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:07.000
That's a breach there.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:09.000
And we learned in this, you don't really ever want to cross

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:11.000
a nine year-old girl with tanks.

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:13.000
(Laughter)

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:16.000
They are the toughest opponents.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.000
And we were very upset.

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:21.000
I thought I was failing as a teacher. Why would she do this?

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.000
But come to find out, a few game days later --

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:27.000
and there are turns where we take negotiation from a team --

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:30.000
actually there's a negotiation period with all teams,

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.000
and each team takes a turn,

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.000
then we go back in negotiation, around and around,

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:36.000
so each turn around is one game day.

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:39.000
So a few game days later it came to light

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:41.000
that we found out this major country

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:43.000
was planning a military offensive

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:46.000
to dominate the entire world.

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.000
Had they had their fuel supplies, they would have done it.

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:51.000
She was able to see the vectors and trend lines and intentions

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:53.000
long before any of us

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.000
and understand what was going to happen

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.000
and made a philosophical decision

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:00.000
to attack in a peace game.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:03.000
Now she used a small war to avert a larger war,

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:05.000
so we stopped and had a very good philosophical discussion

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:07.000
about whether that was right,

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:10.000
conditional good, or not right.

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:13.000
That's the kind of thinking that we put them in, the situations.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:15.000
I could not have designed that in teaching it.

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:18.000
It came about spontaneously through their collective wisdom.

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:24.000
(Applause)

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.000
Another example, a beautiful thing happened.

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.000
We have a letter in the game.

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.000
If you're a military commander and you wage troops --

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:33.000
the little plastic toys on the board -- and you lose them,

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:35.000
I put in a letter.

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:38.000
You have to write a letter to their parents --

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:40.000
the fictional parents of your fictional troops --

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:43.000
explaining what happened and offering your condolences.

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:45.000
So you have a little bit more thought

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:48.000
before you commit to combat.

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:50.000
And so we had this situation come up --

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:52.000
last summer actually,

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:55.000
at Agnor-Hurt School in Albemarle County --

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:58.000
and one of our military commanders got up to read that letter

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:00.000
and one of the other kids said, "Mr. Hunter,

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.000
let's ask -- there's a parent over there."

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:04.000
There was a parent visiting that day, just sitting in the back of the room.

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:06.000
"Let's ask that mom to read the letter.

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:08.000
It'll be more realer if she reads it."

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:11.000
So we did, we asked her, and she gamely picked up the letter.

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:14.000
"Sure." She started reading. She read one sentence.

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:17.000
She read two sentences.

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:20.000
By the third sentence, she was in tears.

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:23.000
I was in tears.

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:25.000
Everybody understood

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:28.000
that when we lose somebody, the winners are not gloating.

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:31.000
We all lose.

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:33.000
And it was an amazing occurrence and an amazing understanding.

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:35.000
I'll show you what my friend David says about this.

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:37.000
He's been in many battles.

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:39.000
(Video) David: We've really had enough of people attacking.

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:43.000
I mean, we've been lucky [most of] the time.

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:45.000
But now I'm feeling really weird

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:49.000
because I'm living what Sun Tzu said one week.

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:51.000
One week he said,

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:53.000
"Those who go into battle and win

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:55.000
will want to go back,

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:57.000
and those who lose in battle

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:00.000
will want to go back and win."

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:02.000
And so I've been winning battles,

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:05.000
so I'm going into battles, more battles.

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:07.000
And I think it's sort of weird to be living

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:09.000
what Sun Tzu said.

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:14.000
JH: I get chills every time I see that.

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:17.000
That's the kind of engagement you want to have happen.

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:20.000
And I can't design that, I can't plan that,

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:22.000
and I can't even test that.

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:24.000
But it's self-evident assessment.

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:27.000
We know that's an authentic assessment of learning.

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:32.000
We have a lot of data, but I think sometimes we go beyond data

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:35.000
with the real truth of what's going on.

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:38.000
So I'll just share a third story.

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:41.000
This is about my friend Brennan.

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:44.000
We had played the game one session after school

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:47.000
for many weeks, about seven weeks,

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:50.000
and we had essentially solved all 50 of the interlocking crises.

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:53.000
The way the game is won is all 50 problems have to be solved

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:55.000
and every country's asset value

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:57.000
has to be increased above its starting point.

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:00.000
Some are poor, some are wealthy. There are billions.

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:02.000
The World Bank president was a third-grader one time.

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:05.000
He says, "How many zeros in a trillion? I've got to calculate that right away."

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:07.000
But he was setting fiscal policy in that game

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:10.000
for high school players who were playing with him.

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:13.000
So the team that was the poorest

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:15.000
had gotten even poorer.

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:17.000
There was no way they could win.

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:19.000
And we were approaching four o'clock, our cut-off time --

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:21.000
there was about a minute left --

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:23.000
and despair just settled over the room.

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:25.000
I thought, I'm failing as a teacher.

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:28.000
I should have gotten it so they could have won.

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:31.000
They shouldn't be failing like this.

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:34.000
I've failed them.

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:36.000
And I was just feeling so sad and dejected.

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:38.000
And suddenly, Brennan walked over to my chair

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:40.000
and he grabbed the bell, the bell I ring

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:42.000
to signal a change or a reconvening of cabinets,

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:44.000
and he ran back to his seat, rang the bell.

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:46.000
Everybody ran to his chair: there was screaming;

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:48.000
there was yelling, waving of their dossiers.

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:50.000
They get these dossiers full of secret documents.

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:52.000
They were gesticulating; they were running around.

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:55.000
I didn't know what they were doing. I'd lost control of my classroom.

00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:59.000
Principal walks in, I'm out of a job.

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:01.000
The parents were looking in the window.

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:04.000
And Brennan runs back to his seat. Everybody runs back to their seat.

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:06.000
He rings the bell again. He says, "We have" --

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:08.000
and there's 12 seconds left on the clock --

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:11.000
"we have, all nations, pooled all our funds together.

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:13.000
And we've got 600 billion dollars.

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:15.000
We're going to offer it as a donation to this poor country.

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:18.000
And if they accept it, it'll raise their asset value and we can win the game.

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:20.000
Will you accept it?"

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:22.000
And there are three seconds left on the clock.

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:25.000
Everybody looks at this prime minister of that country,

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:27.000
and he says, "Yes."

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:30.000
And the game is won.

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:33.000
Spontaneous compassion

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:35.000
that could not be planned for,

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:38.000
that was unexpected and unpredictable.

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:40.000
Every game we play is different.

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:42.000
Some games are more about social issues,

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:44.000
some are more about economic issues.

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:46.000
Some games are more about warfare.

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:49.000
But I don't try to deny them that reality of being human.

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:51.000
I allow them to go there

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:55.000
and, through their own experience, learn, in a bloodless way,

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:58.000
how not to do what they consider to be the wrong thing.

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:00.000
And they find out what is right

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:02.000
their own way, their own selves.

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:05.000
And so in this game,

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:07.000
I've learned so much from it,

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:09.000
but I would say

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:12.000
that if only

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:14.000
they could pick up a critical thinking tool

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:16.000
or creative thinking tool

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:18.000
from this game

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:22.000
and leverage something good for the world,

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:25.000
they may save us all.

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:28.000
If only.

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:30.000
And on behalf of all of my teachers

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:32.000
on whose shoulders I'm standing,

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:35.000
thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

00:19:35.000 --> 00:20:06.000
(Applause)
