00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
I would like to talk today

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
about what I think is one of the greatest adventures

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
human beings have embarked upon,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
which is the quest to understand the universe

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
and our place in it.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
My own interest in this subject, and my passion for it,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
began rather accidentally.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
I had bought a copy of this book,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
"The Universe and Dr. Einstein" --

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
a used paperback from a secondhand bookstore in Seattle.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
A few years after that, in Bangalore,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
I was finding it hard to fall asleep one night,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
and I picked up this book,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
thinking it would put me to sleep in 10 minutes.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
And as it happened,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
I read it from midnight to five in the morning in one shot.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
And I was left with this intense feeling

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
of awe and exhilaration

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
at the universe

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
and our own ability to understand as much as we do.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
And that feeling hasn't left me yet.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
That feeling was the trigger for me

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
to actually change my career --

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
from being a software engineer to become a science writer --

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
so that I could partake in the joy of science,

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
and also the joy of communicating it to others.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
And that feeling also led me

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
to a pilgrimage of sorts,

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
to go literally to the ends of the earth

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
to see telescopes, detectors,

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
instruments that people are building, or have built,

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
in order to probe the cosmos

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
in greater and greater detail.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
So it took me from places like Chile --

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
the Atacama Desert in Chile --

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
to Siberia,

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
to underground mines

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
in the Japanese Alps, in Northern America,

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
all the way to Antarctica

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
and even to the South Pole.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
And today I would like to share with you

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
some images, some stories of these trips.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
I have been basically spending the last few years

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
documenting the efforts

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
of some extremely intrepid men and women

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
who are putting,

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
literally at times, their lives at stake

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
working in some very remote and very hostile places

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.000
so that they may gather the faintest signals from the cosmos

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
in order for us to understand this universe.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
And I first begin with a pie chart --

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
and I promise this is the only pie chart

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
in the whole presentation --

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.000
but it sets up the state of our knowledge of the cosmos.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
All the theories in physics that we have today

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
properly explain what is called normal matter --

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
the stuff that we're all made of --

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
and that's four percent of the universe.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000
Astronomers and cosmologists and physicists think

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000
that there is something called dark matter in the universe,

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
which makes up 23 percent of the universe,

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
and something called dark energy,

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
which permeates the fabric of space-time,

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
that makes up another 73 percent.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
So if you look at this pie chart, 96 percent of the universe,

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
at this point in our exploration of it,

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000
is unknown or not well understood.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000
And most of the experiments, telescopes that I went to see

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000
are in some way addressing this question,

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000
these two twin mysteries of dark matter and dark energy.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000
I will take you first to an underground mine

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
in Northern Minnesota

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
where people are looking

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
for something called dark matter.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000
And the idea here is that they are looking for a sign

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000
of a dark matter particle hitting one of their detectors.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
And the reason why they have to go underground

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
is that, if you did this experiment on the surface of the Earth,

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
the same experiment would be swamped by signals

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000
that could be created by things like cosmic rays,

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
ambient radio activity,

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000
even our own bodies. You might not believe it,

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000
but even our own bodies are radioactive enough to disturb this experiment.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000
So they go deep inside mines

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
to find a kind of environmental silence

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
that will allow them to hear

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.000
the ping of a dark matter particle hitting their detector.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000
And I went to see one of these experiments,

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000
and this is actually -- you can barely see it,

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000
and the reason for that is it's entirely dark in there --

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.000
this is a cavern that was left behind by the miners

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000
who left this mine in 1960.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000
And physicists came and started using it

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000
sometime in the 1980s.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.000
And the miners in the early part of the last century

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000
worked, literally, in candlelight.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000
And today, you would see this inside the mine,

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000
half a mile underground.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000
This is one of the largest underground labs in the world.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000
And, among other things, they're looking for dark matter.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000
There is another way to search for dark matter,

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000
which is indirectly.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000
If dark matter exists in our universe,

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000
in our galaxy,

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000
then these particles should be smashing together

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.000
and producing other particles that we know about --

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000
one of them being neutrinos.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000
And neutrinos you can detect

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000
by the signature they leave

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000
when they hit water molecules.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000
When a neutrino hits a water molecule

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000
it emits a kind of blue light,

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
a flash of blue light,

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
and by looking for this blue light,

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
you can essentially understand something about the neutrino

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.000
and then, indirectly, something about the dark matter

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000
that might have created this neutrino.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.000
But you need very, very large volumes of water

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000
in order to do this.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000
You need something like tens of megatons of water --

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000
almost a gigaton of water --

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.000
in order to have any chance of catching this neutrino.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000
And where in the world would you find such water?

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000
Well the Russians have a tank in their own backyard.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000
This is Lake Baikal.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.000
It is the largest lake in the world. It's 800 km long.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000
It's about 40 to 50 km wide

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000
in most places,

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000
and one to two kilometers deep.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000
And what the Russians are doing

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000
is they're building these detectors

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.000
and immersing them about a kilometer beneath the surface of the lake

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.000
so that they can watch for these flashes of blue light.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000
And this is the scene that greeted me when I landed there.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000
This is Lake Baikal

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000
in the peak of the Siberian winter.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000
The lake is entirely frozen.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.000
And the line of black dots

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000
that you see in the background,

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000
that's the ice camp where the physicists are working.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.000
The reason why they have to work in winter

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.000
is because they don't have the money to work in summer and spring,

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.000
which, if they did that,

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000
they would need ships and submersibles to do their work.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000
So they wait until winter --

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.000
the lake is completely frozen over --

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000
and they use this meter-thick ice

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.000
as a platform on which to establish their ice camp and do their work.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:53.000
So this is the Russians working on the ice

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.000
in the peak of the Siberian winter.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000
They have to drill holes in the ice,

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.000
dive down into the water -- cold, cold water --

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.000
to get hold of the instrument, bring it up,

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.000
do any repairs and maintenance that they need to do,

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000
put it back and get out before the ice melts.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.000
Because that phase of solid ice lasts for two months

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.000
and it's full of cracks.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.000
And you have to imagine, there's an entire sea-like lake

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.000
underneath, moving.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.000
I still don't understand this one Russian man

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.000
working in his bare chest,

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.000
but that tells you how hard he was working.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000
And these people, a handful of people,

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000
have been working for 20 years,

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000
looking for particles that may or may not exist.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.000
And they have dedicated their lives to it.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.000
And just to give you an idea,

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.000
they have spent 20 million over 20 years.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.000
It's very harsh conditions.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000
They work on a shoestring budget.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000
The toilets there are literally holes in the ground

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.000
covered with a wooden shack.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000
And it's that basic,

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000
but they do this every year.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.000
From Siberia to the Atacama Desert in Chile,

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000
to see something called The Very Large Telescope.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.000
The Very Large Telescope

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000
is one of these things that astronomers do --

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000
they name their telescopes rather unimaginatively.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000
I can tell you for a fact,

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:07.000
that the next one that they're planning is called The Extremely Large Telescope.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000
(Laughter)

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000
And you wouldn't believe it,

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.000
but the one after that is going to be called The Overwhelmingly Large Telescope.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.000
But nonetheless,

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.000
it's an extraordinary piece of engineering.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.000
These are four 8.2 meter telescopes.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.000
And these telescopes, among other things,

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.000
they're being used to study

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:28.000
how the expansion of the universe is changing with time.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000
And the more you understand that,

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000
the better you would understand

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.000
what this dark energy that the universe is made of is all about.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.000
And one piece of engineering that I want to leave you with

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.000
as regards this telescope

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.000
is the mirror.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.000
Each mirror, there are four of them,

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.000
is made of a single piece of glass,

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.000
a monolithic piece of high-tech ceramic,

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:51.000
that has been ground down and polished to such accuracy

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:54.000
that the only way to understand what that is

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.000
is [to] imagine a city like Paris,

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:59.000
with all its buildings and the Eiffel Tower,

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:02.000
if you grind down Paris to that kind of accuracy,

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:06.000
you would be left with bumps that are one millimeter high.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:09.000
And that's the kind of polishing that these mirrors have endured.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.000
An extraordinary set of telescopes.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.000
Here's another view of the same.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.000
The reason why you have to build these telescopes

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.000
in places like the Atacama Desert

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:20.000
is because of the high altitude desert.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:23.000
The dry air is really good for telescopes,

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.000
and also, the cloud cover is below the summit of these mountains

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.000
so that the telescopes have

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.000
about 300 days of clear skies.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000
Finally, I want to take you to Antarctica.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:35.000
I want to spend most of my time on this part of the world.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.000
This is cosmology's final frontier.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.000
Some of the most amazing experiments,

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.000
some of the most extreme experiments,

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.000
are being done in Antarctica.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:46.000
I was there to view something called a long-duration balloon flight,

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:49.000
which basically takes telescopes and instruments

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000
all the way to the upper atmosphere,

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:54.000
the upper stratosphere, 40 km up.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.000
And that's where they do their experiments,

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:59.000
and then the balloon, the payload, is brought down.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:02.000
So this is us landing on the Ross Ice Shelf in Antarctica.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000
That's an American C-17 cargo plane

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.000
that flew us from New Zealand

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.000
to McMurdo in Antarctica.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.000
And here we are about to board our bus.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.000
And I don't know if you can read the lettering,

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.000
but it says, "Ivan the Terribus."

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:18.000
And that's taking us to McMurdo.

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:21.000
And this is the scene that greets you in McMurdo.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.000
And you barely might be able to make out

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.000
this hut here.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:28.000
This hut was built by Robert Falcon Scott and his men

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.000
when they first came to Antarctica

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.000
on their first expedition to go to the South Pole.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.000
Because it's so cold,

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:37.000
the entire contents of that hut is still as they left it,

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:40.000
with the remnants of the last meal they cooked still there.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.000
It's an extraordinary place.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.000
This is McMurdo itself. About a thousand people work here in summer,

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.000
and about 200 in winter

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.000
when it's completely dark for six months.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.000
I was here to see the launch

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.000
of this particular type of instrument.

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.000
This is a cosmic ray experiment

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:58.000
that has been launched all the way to the upper-stratosphere

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.000
to an altitude of 40 km.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.000
What I want you to imagine is this is two tons in weight.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.000
So you're using a balloon

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.000
to carry something that is two tons

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:10.000
all the way to an altitude of 40 km.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:13.000
And the engineers, the technicians, the physicists

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:16.000
have all got to assemble on the Ross Ice Shelf,

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:19.000
because Antarctica -- I won't go into the reasons why --

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.000
but it's one of the most favorable places for doing these balloon launches,

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.000
except for the weather.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.000
The weather, as you can imagine,

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.000
this is summer, and you're standing on 200 ft of ice.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.000
And there's a volcano behind,

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.000
which has glaciers at the very top.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:33.000
And what they have to do

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.000
is they have to assemble the entire balloon --

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:38.000
the fabric, parachute and everything -- on the ice

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.000
and then fill it up with helium.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.000
And that process takes about two hours.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:45.000
And the weather can change as they're putting together this whole assembly.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:48.000
For instance, here they are laying down the balloon fabric behind,

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:51.000
which is eventually going to be filled up with helium.

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:53.000
Those two trucks you see at the very end

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:56.000
carry 12 tanks each of compressed helium.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:59.000
Now, in case the weather changes before the launch,

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:02.000
they have to actually pack everything back up into their boxes

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:05.000
and take it out back to McMurdo Station.

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:07.000
And this particular balloon,

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.000
because it has to launch two tons of weight,

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:12.000
is an extremely huge balloon.

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.000
The fabric alone weighs two tons.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:17.000
In order to minimize the weight,

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.000
it's very thin, it's as thin as a sandwich wrapper.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.000
And if they have to pack it back,

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.000
they have to put it into boxes

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:26.000
and stamp on it so that it fits into the box again --

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.000
except, when they did it first,

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.000
it would have been done in Texas.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:33.000
Here, they can't do it with the kind shoes they're wearing,

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.000
so they have to take their shoes off,

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:37.000
get barefoot into the boxes, in this cold,

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.000
and do that kind of work.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.000
That's the kind of dedication these people have.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:43.000
Here's the balloon being filled up with helium,

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.000
and you can see it's a gorgeous sight.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:47.000
Here's a scene

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.000
that shows you the balloon and the payload end-to-end.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:52.000
So the balloon is being filled up with helium on the left-hand side,

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:55.000
and the fabric actually runs all the way to the middle

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:58.000
where there's a piece of electronics and explosives

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.000
being connected to a parachute,

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.000
and then the parachute is then connected to the payload.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.000
And remember, all this wiring is being done

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:07.000
by people in extreme cold, in sub-zero temperatures.

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:10.000
They're wearing about 15 kg of clothing and stuff,

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:13.000
but they have to take their gloves off in order to do that.

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:16.000
And I would like to share with you a launch.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.000
(Video) Radio: Okay, release the balloon,

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:21.000
release the balloon, release the balloon.

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:52.000
Anil Ananthaswamy: And I'll finally like to leave you with two images.

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:55.000
This is an observatory in the Himalayas, in Ladakh in India.

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.000
And the thing I want you to look at here

00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:59.000
is the telescope on the right-hand side.

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.000
And on the far left there

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:03.000
is a 400 year-old Buddhist monastery.

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:05.000
This is a close-up of the Buddhist monastery.

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:08.000
And I was struck by the juxtaposition

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:11.000
of these two enormous disciplines that humanity has.

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:14.000
One is exploring the cosmos on the outside,

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.000
and the other one is exploring our interior being.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:19.000
And both require silence of some sort.

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:21.000
And what struck me was

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.000
every place that I went to to see these telescopes,

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:25.000
the astronomers and cosmologists

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:27.000
are in search of a certain kind of silence,

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:29.000
whether it's silence from radio pollution

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:32.000
or light pollution or whatever.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.000
And it was very obvious

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:36.000
that, if we destroy these silent places on Earth,

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:39.000
we will be stuck on a planet without the ability to look outwards,

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:42.000
because we will not be able to understand the signals that come from outer space.

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.000
Thank you.

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:47.000
(Applause)
