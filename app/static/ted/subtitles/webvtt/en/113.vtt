WEBVTT

00:00:02.063 --> 00:00:04.976
That splendid music, the coming-in music,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.881
"The Elephant March" from "Aida,"
is the music I've chosen for my funeral.

00:00:10.905 --> 00:00:11.976
(Laughter)

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.976
And you can see why. It's triumphal.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.976
I won't feel anything, but if I could,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.976
I would feel triumphal
at having lived at all,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.096
and at having lived
on this splendid planet,

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:30.233
and having been given
the opportunity to understand

00:00:30.257 --> 00:00:36.448
something about why I was here
in the first place, before not being here.

00:00:37.448 --> 00:00:41.867
Can you understand
my quaint English accent?

00:00:41.891 --> 00:00:43.762
(Laughter)

00:00:44.651 --> 00:00:49.726
Like everybody else, I was entranced
yesterday by the animal session.

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:55.189
Robert Full and Frans Lanting and others;

00:00:55.213 --> 00:00:57.439
the beauty of the things that they showed.

00:00:57.463 --> 00:01:02.976
The only slight jarring note was when
Jeffrey Katzenberg said of the mustang,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.831
"the most splendid creatures
that God put on this earth."

00:01:06.855 --> 00:01:10.456
Now of course, we know
that he didn't really mean that,

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:13.633
but in this country at the moment,
you can't be too careful.

00:01:13.657 --> 00:01:14.976
(Laughter)

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:21.976
I'm a biologist, and the central theorem
of our subject: the theory of design,

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.699
Darwin's theory of evolution
by natural selection.

00:01:26.723 --> 00:01:30.976
In professional circles everywhere,
it's of course universally accepted.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.976
In non-professional circles
outside America, it's largely ignored.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.976
But in non-professional
circles within America,

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.976
it arouses so much hostility --

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.076
(Laughter)

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:49.730
it's fair to say that American biologists
are in a state of war.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.975
The war is so worrying at present,

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:55.572
with court cases coming
up in one state after another,

00:01:55.596 --> 00:01:57.976
that I felt I had to say
something about it.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.976
If you want to know what I have
to say about Darwinism itself,

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.976
I'm afraid you're going
to have to look at my books,

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.976
which you won't find
in the bookstore outside.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.976
(Laughter)

00:02:11.467 --> 00:02:12.976
Contemporary court cases

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.976
often concern an allegedly
new version of creationism,

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.299
called "Intelligent Design," or ID.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.792
Don't be fooled.
There's nothing new about ID.

00:02:25.149 --> 00:02:28.499
It's just creationism under another name,

00:02:28.523 --> 00:02:31.881
rechristened --
I choose the word advisedly --

00:02:31.905 --> 00:02:32.976
(Laughter)

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.976
for tactical, political reasons.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.976
The arguments of so-called ID theorists

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.372
are the same old arguments
that had been refuted again and again,

00:02:40.396 --> 00:02:42.829
since Darwin down to the present day.

00:02:43.908 --> 00:02:46.976
There is an effective evolution lobby

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.096
coordinating the fight
on behalf of science,

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:51.976
and I try to do all I can to help them,

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.976
but they get quite upset
when people like me dare to mention

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.579
that we happen to be atheists
as well as evolutionists.

00:03:00.302 --> 00:03:04.976
They see us as rocking the boat,
and you can understand why.

00:03:05.689 --> 00:03:10.418
Creationists, lacking any coherent
scientific argument for their case,

00:03:10.442 --> 00:03:15.396
fall back on the popular
phobia against atheism:

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:18.976
Teach your children
evolution in biology class,

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.976
and they'll soon move on to drugs,
grand larceny and sexual "pre-version."

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.789
(Laughter)

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.976
In fact, of course, educated
theologians from the Pope down

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.124
are firm in their support of evolution.

00:03:34.886 --> 00:03:37.805
This book, "Finding
Darwin's God," by Kenneth Miller,

00:03:37.829 --> 00:03:41.892
is one of the most effective attacks
on Intelligent Design that I know

00:03:41.916 --> 00:03:45.976
and it's all the more effective because
it's written by a devout Christian.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.582
People like Kenneth Miller could be called
a "godsend" to the evolution lobby,

00:03:50.606 --> 00:03:51.976
(Laughter)

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.727
because they expose the lie
that evolutionism is, as a matter of fact,

00:03:56.751 --> 00:03:58.374
tantamount to atheism.

00:03:58.398 --> 00:04:01.532
People like me, on the other
hand, rock the boat.

00:04:03.175 --> 00:04:05.976
But here, I want to say something
nice about creationists.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.676
It's not a thing I often do,
so listen carefully.

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:09.976
(Laughter)

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.976
I think they're right about one thing.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:14.976
I think they're right that evolution

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.643
is fundamentally hostile to religion.

00:04:18.643 --> 00:04:21.857
I've already said that many individual
evolutionists, like the Pope,

00:04:21.881 --> 00:04:24.976
are also religious, but I think
they're deluding themselves.

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:28.404
I believe a true
understanding of Darwinism

00:04:28.428 --> 00:04:31.968
is deeply corrosive to religious faith.

00:04:33.349 --> 00:04:38.572
Now, it may sound as though
I'm about to preach atheism,

00:04:38.596 --> 00:04:42.428
and I want to reassure you
that that's not what I'm going to do.

00:04:42.452 --> 00:04:45.976
In an audience
as sophisticated as this one,

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.353
that would be preaching to the choir.

00:04:48.853 --> 00:04:51.473
No, what I want to urge upon you --

00:04:51.497 --> 00:04:55.240
(Laughter)

00:04:55.264 --> 00:04:59.976
Instead, what I want to urge
upon you is militant atheism.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:01.976
(Laughter)

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.198
(Applause)

00:05:05.222 --> 00:05:07.977
But that's putting it too negatively.

00:05:08.001 --> 00:05:12.650
If I was a person who were interested
in preserving religious faith,

00:05:12.674 --> 00:05:17.823
I would be very afraid of the positive
power of evolutionary science,

00:05:17.847 --> 00:05:20.696
and indeed science generally,
but evolution in particular,

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:26.582
to inspire and enthrall,
precisely because it is atheistic.

00:05:28.337 --> 00:05:32.090
Now, the difficult problem
for any theory of biological design

00:05:32.114 --> 00:05:37.376
is to explain the massive statistical
improbability of living things.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:42.772
Statistical improbability
in the direction of good design --

00:05:42.796 --> 00:05:44.684
"complexity" is another word for this.

00:05:45.269 --> 00:05:47.016
The standard creationist argument --

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:49.976
there is only one;
they're all reduced to this one --

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.380
takes off from
a statistical improbability.

00:05:52.404 --> 00:05:55.690
Living creatures are too complex
to have come about by chance;

00:05:55.714 --> 00:05:57.976
therefore, they must have had a designer.

00:05:58.594 --> 00:06:01.038
This argument of course,
shoots itself in the foot.

00:06:01.062 --> 00:06:04.377
Any designer capable of designing
something really complex

00:06:04.401 --> 00:06:06.982
has to be even more complex himself,

00:06:07.006 --> 00:06:10.976
and that's before we even start
on the other things he's expected to do,

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.914
like forgive sins, bless
marriages, listen to prayers --

00:06:14.938 --> 00:06:16.976
favor our side in a war --

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.386
(Laughter)

00:06:19.410 --> 00:06:21.976
disapprove of our sex lives, and so on.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:23.976
(Laughter)

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:28.976
Complexity is the problem
that any theory of biology has to solve,

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:33.707
and you can't solve it by postulating
an agent that is even more complex,

00:06:33.731 --> 00:06:36.341
thereby simply compounding the problem.

00:06:36.928 --> 00:06:41.325
Darwinian natural selection
is so stunningly elegant

00:06:41.349 --> 00:06:45.174
because it solves the problem
of explaining complexity

00:06:45.198 --> 00:06:48.253
in terms of nothing but simplicity.

00:06:49.094 --> 00:06:52.363
Essentially, it does it
by providing a smooth ramp

00:06:52.387 --> 00:06:55.702
of gradual, step-by-step increment.

00:06:56.757 --> 00:06:58.630
But here, I only want to make the point

00:06:58.654 --> 00:07:02.344
that the elegance of Darwinism
is corrosive to religion,

00:07:02.368 --> 00:07:06.976
precisely because it is so elegant,
so parsimonious, so powerful,

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:08.714
so economically powerful.

00:07:11.285 --> 00:07:17.182
It has the sinewy economy
of a beautiful suspension bridge.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.591
The God theory is not just a bad theory.

00:07:20.615 --> 00:07:22.385
It turns out to be -- in principle --

00:07:22.409 --> 00:07:25.976
incapable of doing the job required of it.

00:07:26.464 --> 00:07:29.575
So, returning to tactics
and the evolution lobby,

00:07:29.599 --> 00:07:32.721
I want to argue that rocking the boat

00:07:32.745 --> 00:07:37.452
may be just the right thing to do.

00:07:38.452 --> 00:07:41.048
My approach to attacking creationism is --

00:07:41.072 --> 00:07:43.555
unlike the evolution lobby --

00:07:43.579 --> 00:07:48.309
my approach to attacking creationism
is to attack religion as a whole.

00:07:49.356 --> 00:07:53.618
And at this point I need
to acknowledge the remarkable taboo

00:07:53.642 --> 00:07:56.128
against speaking ill of religion,

00:07:56.152 --> 00:07:59.501
and I'm going to do so in the words
of the late Douglas Adams,

00:07:59.525 --> 00:08:01.764
a dear friend who,
if he never came to TED,

00:08:01.788 --> 00:08:03.770
certainly should have been invited.

00:08:03.794 --> 00:08:05.261
(Richard Saul Wurman: He was.)

00:08:05.285 --> 00:08:08.308
Richard Dawkins: He was. Good.
I thought he must have been.

00:08:08.332 --> 00:08:11.176
He begins this speech,
which was tape recorded in Cambridge

00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:12.976
shortly before he died --

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:17.573
he begins by explaining how science
works through the testing of hypotheses

00:08:17.597 --> 00:08:21.200
that are framed to be vulnerable
to disproof, and then he goes on.

00:08:21.224 --> 00:08:24.976
I quote, "Religion doesn't
seem to work like that.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:28.976
It has certain ideas at the heart of it,
which we call 'sacred' or 'holy.'

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.976
What it means is:
here is an idea or a notion

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:35.655
that you're not allowed
to say anything bad about.

00:08:35.679 --> 00:08:39.976
You're just not. Why not?
Because you're not."

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:43.904
(Laughter)

00:08:43.928 --> 00:08:46.349
"Why should it be
that it's perfectly legitimate

00:08:46.373 --> 00:08:48.362
to support the Republicans or Democrats,

00:08:48.386 --> 00:08:50.746
this model of economics versus that,

00:08:50.770 --> 00:08:52.735
Macintosh instead of Windows,

00:08:52.759 --> 00:08:55.720
but to have an opinion
about how the universe began,

00:08:55.744 --> 00:08:57.380
about who created the universe --

00:08:57.404 --> 00:08:59.053
no, that's holy.

00:08:59.784 --> 00:09:03.150
So, we're used to not
challenging religious ideas,

00:09:03.174 --> 00:09:06.364
and it's very interesting how much
of a furor Richard creates

00:09:06.388 --> 00:09:07.547
when he does it." --

00:09:07.571 --> 00:09:09.371
He meant me, not that one.

00:09:10.578 --> 00:09:12.976
"Everybody gets absolutely
frantic about it,

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.588
because you're not allowed
to say these things.

00:09:15.612 --> 00:09:17.309
Yet when you look at it rationally,

00:09:17.333 --> 00:09:19.429
there's no reason why those ideas

00:09:19.453 --> 00:09:22.128
shouldn't be as open
to debate as any other,

00:09:22.152 --> 00:09:25.221
except that we've agreed
somehow between us

00:09:25.245 --> 00:09:26.619
that they shouldn't be."

00:09:26.983 --> 00:09:29.300
And that's the end
of the quote from Douglas.

00:09:31.864 --> 00:09:35.976
In my view, not only is science
corrosive to religion;

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.151
religion is corrosive to science.

00:09:39.698 --> 00:09:43.571
It teaches people
to be satisfied with trivial,

00:09:43.595 --> 00:09:46.618
supernatural non-explanations,

00:09:46.642 --> 00:09:50.373
and blinds them to the wonderful,
real explanations

00:09:50.397 --> 00:09:51.976
that we have within our grasp.

00:09:52.595 --> 00:09:58.636
It teaches them to accept
authority, revelation and faith,

00:09:58.660 --> 00:10:02.129
instead of always insisting on evidence.

00:10:04.081 --> 00:10:08.620
There's Douglas Adams, magnificent picture
from his book, "Last Chance to See."

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.660
Now, there's a typical scientific journal,

00:10:12.684 --> 00:10:14.317
The Quarterly Review of Biology.

00:10:14.341 --> 00:10:17.197
And I'm going to put
together, as guest editor,

00:10:17.221 --> 00:10:22.466
a special issue on the question,
"Did an asteroid kill the dinosaurs?"

00:10:22.490 --> 00:10:26.587
And the first paper
is a standard scientific paper,

00:10:26.611 --> 00:10:28.486
presenting evidence,

00:10:28.510 --> 00:10:30.245
"Iridium layer at the K-T boundary,

00:10:30.269 --> 00:10:32.690
and potassium argon dated
crater in Yucatan,

00:10:32.714 --> 00:10:35.325
indicate that an asteroid
killed the dinosaurs."

00:10:35.349 --> 00:10:37.976
Perfectly ordinary scientific paper.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:39.533
Now, the next one.

00:10:39.557 --> 00:10:42.222
"The President of the Royal Society

00:10:42.246 --> 00:10:46.734
has been vouchsafed
a strong inner conviction

00:10:46.758 --> 00:10:49.261
that an asteroid killed the dinosaurs."

00:10:49.285 --> 00:10:51.238
(Laughter)

00:10:53.530 --> 00:10:59.332
"It has been privately
revealed to Professor Huxtane

00:10:59.356 --> 00:11:01.277
that an asteroid killed the dinosaurs."

00:11:01.301 --> 00:11:02.689
(Laughter)

00:11:04.960 --> 00:11:07.261
"Professor Hordley was brought up

00:11:07.285 --> 00:11:09.976
to have total and unquestioning faith" --

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:11.032
(Laughter) --

00:11:11.056 --> 00:11:15.852
"that an asteroid killed the dinosaurs."

00:11:18.459 --> 00:11:22.976
"Professor Hawkins has
promulgated an official dogma

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:26.444
binding on all loyal Hawkinsians

00:11:26.468 --> 00:11:29.337
that an asteroid killed the dinosaurs."

00:11:29.361 --> 00:11:31.301
(Laughter)

00:11:32.523 --> 00:11:35.824
That's inconceivable, of course.

00:11:36.848 --> 00:11:38.078
But suppose --

00:11:38.102 --> 00:11:41.148
[Supporters of the Asteroid Theory
cannot be patriotic citizens]

00:11:41.172 --> 00:11:42.887
(Laughter)

00:11:42.911 --> 00:11:45.530
(Applause)

00:11:47.774 --> 00:11:50.976
In 1987, a reporter asked George Bush, Sr.

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:54.818
whether he recognized
the equal citizenship and patriotism

00:11:54.842 --> 00:11:56.976
of Americans who are atheists.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.976
Mr. Bush's reply has become infamous.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:03.976
"No, I don't know that atheists
should be considered citizens,

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:05.976
nor should they be considered patriots.

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.634
This is one nation under God."

00:12:09.571 --> 00:12:12.190
Bush's bigotry
was not an isolated mistake,

00:12:12.214 --> 00:12:15.499
blurted out in the heat
of the moment and later retracted.

00:12:15.523 --> 00:12:20.370
He stood by it in the face of repeated
calls for clarification or withdrawal.

00:12:20.394 --> 00:12:21.624
He really meant it.

00:12:21.648 --> 00:12:26.203
More to the point, he knew
it posed no threat to his election --

00:12:26.227 --> 00:12:27.409
quite the contrary.

00:12:27.433 --> 00:12:31.163
Democrats as well as Republicans
parade their religiousness

00:12:31.187 --> 00:12:32.911
if they want to get elected.

00:12:32.935 --> 00:12:37.095
Both parties invoke
"one nation under God."

00:12:37.119 --> 00:12:39.431
What would Thomas Jefferson have said?

00:12:39.455 --> 00:12:43.081
[In every country and in every age,
the priest has been hostile to liberty]

00:12:43.105 --> 00:12:46.976
Incidentally, I'm not usually
very proud of being British,

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:50.976
but you can't help making the comparison.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:57.969
(Applause)

00:12:59.485 --> 00:13:01.976
In practice, what is an atheist?

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:06.308
An atheist is just somebody
who feels about Yahweh

00:13:06.332 --> 00:13:12.595
the way any decent Christian feels
about Thor or Baal or the golden calf.

00:13:12.619 --> 00:13:16.976
As has been said before, we are
all atheists about most of the gods

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:19.305
that humanity has ever believed in.

00:13:19.329 --> 00:13:21.976
Some of us just go one god further.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.976
(Laughter)

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:31.976
(Applause)

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:35.334
And however we define atheism,
it's surely the kind of academic belief

00:13:35.358 --> 00:13:38.976
that a person is entitled
to hold without being vilified

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:43.156
as an unpatriotic,
unelectable non-citizen.

00:13:44.045 --> 00:13:47.429
Nevertheless, it's an undeniable fact
that to own up to being an atheist

00:13:47.453 --> 00:13:51.993
is tantamount to introducing yourself
as Mr. Hitler or Miss Beelzebub.

00:13:52.583 --> 00:13:56.285
And that all stems
from the perception of atheists

00:13:56.309 --> 00:14:00.214
as some kind of weird, way-out minority.

00:14:00.889 --> 00:14:03.976
Natalie Angier wrote a rather
sad piece in the New Yorker,

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:06.063
saying how lonely she felt as an atheist.

00:14:06.420 --> 00:14:08.858
She clearly feels
in a beleaguered minority.

00:14:08.882 --> 00:14:14.137
But actually, how do American atheists
stack up numerically?

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:17.899
The latest survey makes
surprisingly encouraging reading.

00:14:18.296 --> 00:14:21.726
Christianity, of course, takes a massive
lion's share of the population,

00:14:21.750 --> 00:14:23.344
with nearly 160 million.

00:14:24.256 --> 00:14:27.733
But what would you think
was the second largest group,

00:14:27.757 --> 00:14:33.193
convincingly outnumbering Jews
with 2.8 million, Muslims at 1.1 million,

00:14:33.217 --> 00:14:36.867
Hindus, Buddhists and all other
religions put together?

00:14:36.891 --> 00:14:39.534
The second largest group,
with nearly 30 million,

00:14:39.558 --> 00:14:42.748
is the one described
as non-religious or secular.

00:14:43.701 --> 00:14:46.976
You can't help wondering
why vote-seeking politicians

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:52.182
are so proverbially overawed by the power
of, for example, the Jewish lobby --

00:14:52.206 --> 00:14:56.523
the state of Israel seems to owe its very
existence to the American Jewish vote --

00:14:56.547 --> 00:14:57.976
while at the same time,

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:02.090
consigning the non-religious
to political oblivion.

00:15:03.344 --> 00:15:06.976
This secular non-religious vote,
if properly mobilized,

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:09.913
is nine times as numerous
as the Jewish vote.

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:13.976
Why does this far more
substantial minority

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:17.207
not make a move to exercise
its political muscle?

00:15:18.285 --> 00:15:21.055
Well, so much for quantity.
How about quality?

00:15:21.539 --> 00:15:24.642
Is there any correlation,
positive or negative,

00:15:24.666 --> 00:15:28.677
between intelligence
and tendency to be religious?

00:15:28.701 --> 00:15:30.938
[Them folks misunderestimated me]

00:15:30.962 --> 00:15:35.050
(Laughter)

00:15:35.582 --> 00:15:38.976
The survey that I quoted,
which is the ARIS survey,

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:42.048
didn't break down its data
by socio-economic class or education,

00:15:42.072 --> 00:15:43.794
IQ or anything else.

00:15:43.818 --> 00:15:47.976
But a recent article by Paul G. Bell
in the Mensa magazine

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:49.976
provides some straws in the wind.

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:52.477
Mensa, as you know,
is an international organization

00:15:52.501 --> 00:15:55.811
for people with very high IQ.

00:15:55.835 --> 00:16:00.770
And from a meta-analysis
of the literature,

00:16:00.794 --> 00:16:05.976
Bell concludes that, I quote --
"Of 43 studies carried out since 1927

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:08.295
on the relationship
between religious belief,

00:16:08.319 --> 00:16:10.785
and one's intelligence
or educational level,

00:16:10.809 --> 00:16:14.976
all but four found an inverse connection.

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:18.617
That is, the higher one's intelligence
or educational level,

00:16:18.641 --> 00:16:20.976
the less one is likely to be religious."

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:23.175
Well, I haven't seen
the original 42 studies,

00:16:23.199 --> 00:16:26.207
and I can't comment on that meta-analysis,

00:16:26.231 --> 00:16:29.944
but I would like to see more
studies done along those lines.

00:16:29.968 --> 00:16:33.031
And I know that there are --
if I could put a little plug here --

00:16:33.055 --> 00:16:34.651
there are people in this audience

00:16:34.675 --> 00:16:39.976
easily capable of financing a massive
research survey to settle the question,

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:42.585
and I put the suggestion up,
for what it's worth.

00:16:42.609 --> 00:16:44.259
But let me know show you some data

00:16:44.283 --> 00:16:46.512
that have been properly
published and analyzed,

00:16:46.536 --> 00:16:50.528
on one special group --
namely, top scientists.

00:16:51.444 --> 00:16:56.976
In 1998, Larson and Witham
polled the cream of American scientists,

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:00.691
those who'd been honored by election
to the National Academy of Sciences,

00:17:00.715 --> 00:17:03.346
and among this select group,

00:17:03.370 --> 00:17:08.817
belief in a personal God dropped
to a shattering seven percent.

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:14.747
About 20 percent are agnostic;
the rest could fairly be called atheists.

00:17:14.771 --> 00:17:17.976
Similar figures obtained
for belief in personal immortality.

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:20.976
Among biological scientists,
the figure is even lower:

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:24.755
5.5 percent, only, believe in God.

00:17:24.779 --> 00:17:27.976
Physical scientists, it's 7.5 percent.

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:30.976
I've not seen corresponding
figures for elite scholars

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:33.976
in other fields,
such as history or philosophy,

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:36.174
but I'd be surprised
if they were different.

00:17:37.491 --> 00:17:40.714
So, we've reached a truly
remarkable situation,

00:17:40.738 --> 00:17:45.753
a grotesque mismatch
between the American intelligentsia

00:17:45.777 --> 00:17:47.546
and the American electorate.

00:17:48.364 --> 00:17:51.976
A philosophical opinion
about the nature of the universe,

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:55.976
which is held by the vast majority
of top American scientists

00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:59.856
and probably the majority
of the intelligentsia generally,

00:17:59.880 --> 00:18:02.680
is so abhorrent to the American electorate

00:18:02.704 --> 00:18:07.608
that no candidate for popular election
dare affirm it in public.

00:18:08.077 --> 00:18:10.976
If I'm right, this means that high office

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:13.646
in the greatest country in the world

00:18:13.670 --> 00:18:17.757
is barred to the very people
best qualified to hold it --

00:18:17.781 --> 00:18:18.976
the intelligentsia --

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:21.976
unless they are prepared
to lie about their beliefs.

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:25.494
To put it bluntly:
American political opportunities

00:18:25.518 --> 00:18:27.976
are heavily loaded against those

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:30.785
who are simultaneously
intelligent and honest.

00:18:30.809 --> 00:18:32.015
(Laughter)

00:18:32.039 --> 00:18:38.350
(Applause)

00:18:38.374 --> 00:18:41.976
I'm not a citizen of this country,
so I hope it won't be thought unbecoming

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:44.976
if I suggest that something
needs to be done.

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:47.500
(Laughter)

00:18:47.524 --> 00:18:49.976
And I've already hinted
what that something is.

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:53.757
From what I've seen of TED, I think this
may be the ideal place to launch it.

00:18:54.479 --> 00:18:56.630
Again, I fear it will cost money.

00:18:56.654 --> 00:18:59.201
We need a consciousness-raising,

00:18:59.225 --> 00:19:02.976
coming-out campaign for American atheists.

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:04.976
(Laughter)

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:08.720
This could be similar to the campaign
organized by homosexuals

00:19:08.744 --> 00:19:09.976
a few years ago,

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:13.333
although heaven forbid
that we should stoop to public outing

00:19:13.357 --> 00:19:14.976
of people against their will.

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:17.976
In most cases, people who out themselves

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:21.976
will help to destroy the myth that
there is something wrong with atheists.

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:23.153
On the contrary,

00:19:23.177 --> 00:19:26.247
they'll demonstrate that atheists
are often the kinds of people

00:19:26.271 --> 00:19:28.976
who could serve as decent
role models for your children,

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:33.767
the kinds of people an advertising agent
could use to recommend a product,

00:19:33.791 --> 00:19:36.623
the kinds of people
who are sitting in this room.

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:40.976
There should be a snowball effect,
a positive feedback,

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:43.976
such that the more names
we have, the more we get.

00:19:44.590 --> 00:19:47.359
There could be non-linearities,
threshold effects.

00:19:47.383 --> 00:19:49.462
When a critical mass has been obtained,

00:19:49.486 --> 00:19:52.391
there's an abrupt
acceleration in recruitment.

00:19:52.415 --> 00:19:54.129
And again, it will need money.

00:19:55.494 --> 00:19:58.976
I suspect that the word "atheist" itself

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:02.467
contains or remains a stumbling block

00:20:02.491 --> 00:20:05.167
far out of proportion
to what it actually means,

00:20:05.191 --> 00:20:06.764
and a stumbling block to people

00:20:06.788 --> 00:20:09.845
who otherwise might be
happy to out themselves.

00:20:09.869 --> 00:20:12.594
So, what other words might
be used to smooth the path,

00:20:12.618 --> 00:20:15.166
oil the wheels, sugar the pill?

00:20:16.382 --> 00:20:19.380
Darwin himself preferred "agnostic" --

00:20:19.404 --> 00:20:22.508
and not only out of loyalty
to his friend Huxley,

00:20:22.532 --> 00:20:24.059
who coined the term.

00:20:24.733 --> 00:20:27.566
Darwin said, "I have never been an atheist

00:20:27.590 --> 00:20:30.288
in the same sense of denying
the existence of a God.

00:20:30.796 --> 00:20:32.976
I think that generally an 'agnostic'

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:36.108
would be the most correct
description of my state of mind."

00:20:36.846 --> 00:20:41.664
He even became uncharacteristically
tetchy with Edward Aveling.

00:20:42.259 --> 00:20:43.976
Aveling was a militant atheist

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:45.976
who failed to persuade Darwin

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:48.976
to accept the dedication
of his book on atheism --

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:51.690
incidentally, giving rise
to a fascinating myth

00:20:51.714 --> 00:20:55.111
that Karl Marx tried to dedicate
"Das Kapital" to Darwin,

00:20:55.135 --> 00:20:57.503
which he didn't, it was
actually Edward Aveling.

00:20:57.527 --> 00:21:01.976
What happened was that Aveling's
mistress was Marx's daughter,

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:05.281
and when both Darwin and Marx were dead,

00:21:05.305 --> 00:21:09.519
Marx's papers became muddled
up with Aveling's papers,

00:21:09.543 --> 00:21:13.850
and a letter from Darwin saying,
"My dear sir, thank you very much

00:21:13.874 --> 00:21:16.237
but I don't want you
to dedicate your book to me,"

00:21:16.261 --> 00:21:19.514
was mistakenly supposed
to be addressed to Marx,

00:21:19.538 --> 00:21:22.855
and that gave rise to this whole
myth, which you've probably heard.

00:21:22.879 --> 00:21:27.418
It's a sort of urban myth, that Marx
tried to dedicate "Kapital" to Darwin.

00:21:27.442 --> 00:21:33.809
Anyway, it was Aveling, and when
they met, Darwin challenged Aveling.

00:21:34.682 --> 00:21:38.521
"Why do you call yourselves atheists?"

00:21:42.148 --> 00:21:46.435
"'Agnostic, '" retorted Aveling, "was
simply 'atheist' writ respectable,

00:21:46.459 --> 00:21:50.268
and 'atheist' was simply
'agnostic' writ aggressive."

00:21:50.292 --> 00:21:53.514
Darwin complained, "But why
should you be so aggressive?"

00:21:54.141 --> 00:21:57.737
Darwin thought that atheism might be
well and good for the intelligentsia,

00:21:57.761 --> 00:22:00.999
but that ordinary people were
not, quote, "ripe for it."

00:22:01.857 --> 00:22:05.261
Which is, of course, our old friend,
the "don't rock the boat" argument.

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:10.976
It's not recorded whether Aveling told
Darwin to come down off his high horse.

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:12.827
(Laughter)

00:22:12.851 --> 00:22:15.201
But in any case,
that was more than 100 years ago.

00:22:15.225 --> 00:22:17.613
You'd think we might have
grown up since then.

00:22:18.129 --> 00:22:23.393
Now, a friend, an intelligent lapsed Jew,

00:22:23.417 --> 00:22:27.542
who, incidentally, observes the Sabbath
for reasons of cultural solidarity,

00:22:27.566 --> 00:22:31.158
describes himself
as a "tooth-fairy agnostic."

00:22:32.066 --> 00:22:33.629
He won't call himself an atheist

00:22:33.653 --> 00:22:36.976
because it's, in principle,
impossible to prove a negative,

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:39.976
but "agnostic" on its own might
suggest that God's existence

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:45.142
was therefore on equal terms
of likelihood as his non-existence.

00:22:45.166 --> 00:22:49.483
So, my friend is strictly
agnostic about the tooth fairy,

00:22:49.507 --> 00:22:52.500
but it isn't very likely, is it?

00:22:52.524 --> 00:22:53.976
Like God.

00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:56.007
Hence the phrase, "tooth-fairy agnostic."

00:22:56.329 --> 00:22:58.091
Bertrand Russell made the same point

00:22:58.115 --> 00:23:01.678
using a hypothetical teapot
in orbit about Mars.

00:23:02.138 --> 00:23:03.976
You would strictly have to be agnostic

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:06.429
about whether there is a teapot
in orbit about Mars,

00:23:06.453 --> 00:23:09.453
but that doesn't mean you treat
the likelihood of its existence

00:23:09.477 --> 00:23:12.281
as on all fours with its non-existence.

00:23:12.305 --> 00:23:15.610
The list of things which we strictly
have to be agnostic about

00:23:15.634 --> 00:23:18.976
doesn't stop at tooth fairies
and teapots; it's infinite.

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:21.477
If you want to believe
one particular one of them --

00:23:21.501 --> 00:23:25.581
unicorns or tooth fairies
or teapots or Yahweh --

00:23:25.605 --> 00:23:27.976
the onus is on you to say why.

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:31.358
The onus is not on the rest
of us to say why not.

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:33.382
We, who are atheists,

00:23:33.406 --> 00:23:36.797
are also a-fairyists and a-teapotists.

00:23:36.821 --> 00:23:39.462
(Laughter)

00:23:39.486 --> 00:23:41.074
But we don't bother to say so.

00:23:41.843 --> 00:23:45.669
And this is why my friend
uses "tooth-fairy agnostic"

00:23:45.693 --> 00:23:48.268
as a label for what most people
would call atheist.

00:23:48.679 --> 00:23:54.098
Nonetheless, if we want to attract
deep-down atheists to come out publicly,

00:23:54.122 --> 00:23:57.211
we're going to have find
something better to stick on our banner

00:23:57.235 --> 00:23:59.733
than "tooth-fairy" or "teapot agnostic."

00:24:00.643 --> 00:24:02.175
So, how about "humanist"?

00:24:04.580 --> 00:24:08.976
This has the advantage of a worldwide
network of well-organized associations

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:10.976
and journals and things already in place.

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:13.948
My problem with it is only
its apparent anthropocentrism.

00:24:13.972 --> 00:24:15.978
One of the things
we've learned from Darwin

00:24:16.002 --> 00:24:18.478
is that the human species is only one

00:24:18.502 --> 00:24:22.306
among millions of cousins,
some close, some distant.

00:24:22.330 --> 00:24:24.863
And there are other possibilities,
like "naturalist,"

00:24:24.887 --> 00:24:27.322
but that also has problems of confusion,

00:24:27.346 --> 00:24:29.552
because Darwin would have
thought naturalist --

00:24:29.576 --> 00:24:32.711
"Naturalist" means, of course,
as opposed to "supernaturalist" --

00:24:32.735 --> 00:24:34.099
and it is used sometimes --

00:24:34.123 --> 00:24:37.517
Darwin would have been confused
by the other sense of "naturalist,"

00:24:37.541 --> 00:24:38.732
which he was, of course,

00:24:38.756 --> 00:24:43.748
and I suppose there might be others
who would confuse it with "nudism".

00:24:43.772 --> 00:24:44.990
(Laughter)

00:24:45.014 --> 00:24:51.912
Such people might be those
belonging to the British lynch mob,

00:24:51.936 --> 00:24:56.976
which last year attacked a pediatrician
in mistake for a pedophile.

00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:00.525
(Laughter)

00:25:02.549 --> 00:25:05.709
I think the best of the available
alternatives for "atheist"

00:25:05.733 --> 00:25:06.976
is simply "non-theist."

00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:10.000
It lacks the strong connotation
that there's definitely no God,

00:25:10.024 --> 00:25:15.883
and it could therefore easily be embraced
by teapot or tooth-fairy agnostics.

00:25:15.907 --> 00:25:21.438
It's completely compatible
with the God of the physicists.

00:25:21.462 --> 00:25:27.976
When atheists like Stephen Hawking
and Albert Einstein use the word "God,"

00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:31.713
they use it of course
as a metaphorical shorthand

00:25:31.737 --> 00:25:36.308
for that deep, mysterious part of physics
which we don't yet understand.

00:25:37.221 --> 00:25:42.237
"Non-theist" will do for all that,
yet unlike "atheist,"

00:25:42.261 --> 00:25:49.110
it doesn't have the same
phobic, hysterical responses.

00:25:49.558 --> 00:25:51.412
But I think, actually, the alternative

00:25:51.436 --> 00:25:54.285
is to grasp the nettle
of the word "atheism" itself,

00:25:54.309 --> 00:25:56.976
precisely because it is a taboo word,

00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:00.278
carrying frissons of hysterical phobia.

00:26:01.214 --> 00:26:04.646
Critical mass may be harder
to achieve with the word "atheist"

00:26:04.670 --> 00:26:06.225
than with the word "non-theist,"

00:26:06.249 --> 00:26:08.209
or some other non-confrontational word.

00:26:08.685 --> 00:26:12.447
But if we did achieve it
with that dread word "atheist" itself,

00:26:12.471 --> 00:26:15.264
the political impact
would be even greater.

00:26:16.343 --> 00:26:19.748
Now, I said that if I were religious,
I'd be very afraid of evolution --

00:26:19.772 --> 00:26:23.406
I'd go further: I would fear science
in general, if properly understood.

00:26:23.430 --> 00:26:26.643
And this is because
the scientific worldview

00:26:26.667 --> 00:26:29.732
is so much more exciting, more poetic,

00:26:29.756 --> 00:26:32.233
more filled with sheer wonder

00:26:32.257 --> 00:26:37.293
than anything in the poverty-stricken
arsenals of the religious imagination.

00:26:39.237 --> 00:26:43.976
As Carl Sagan, another recently
dead hero, put it,

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:48.566
"How is it that hardly any major
religion has looked at science

00:26:48.590 --> 00:26:52.885
and concluded, 'This
is better than we thought!

00:26:52.909 --> 00:26:55.381
The universe is much bigger
than our prophet said,

00:26:55.405 --> 00:26:58.612
grander, more subtle, more elegant'?

00:26:58.636 --> 00:27:00.976
Instead they say, 'No, no, no!

00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:04.634
My god is a little god,
and I want him to stay that way.'

00:27:06.179 --> 00:27:08.309
A religion, old or new,

00:27:08.333 --> 00:27:10.976
that stressed the magnificence
of the universe

00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:12.976
as revealed by modern science,

00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:16.664
might be able to draw forth
reserves of reverence and awe

00:27:16.688 --> 00:27:19.625
hardly tapped by the conventional faiths."

00:27:21.220 --> 00:27:24.356
Now, this is an elite audience,

00:27:24.380 --> 00:27:29.134
and I would therefore expect
about 10 percent of you to be religious.

00:27:30.904 --> 00:27:35.383
Many of you probably subscribe
to our polite cultural belief

00:27:35.407 --> 00:27:37.596
that we should respect religion.

00:27:38.303 --> 00:27:41.976
But I also suspect
that a fair number of those

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:45.357
secretly despise religion as much as I do.

00:27:45.769 --> 00:27:47.028
(Laughter)

00:27:47.052 --> 00:27:49.905
If you're one of them, and of course
many of you may not be,

00:27:49.929 --> 00:27:51.237
but if you are one of them,

00:27:51.261 --> 00:27:53.329
I'm asking you to stop being polite,

00:27:53.353 --> 00:27:55.162
come out, and say so.

00:27:56.113 --> 00:27:58.112
And if you happen to be rich,

00:27:58.136 --> 00:28:01.718
give some thought to ways
in which you might make a difference.

00:28:02.369 --> 00:28:04.739
The religious lobby in this country

00:28:04.763 --> 00:28:10.293
is massively financed by foundations --
to say nothing of all the tax benefits --

00:28:10.317 --> 00:28:14.841
by foundations, such as the Templeton
Foundation and the Discovery Institute.

00:28:15.515 --> 00:28:19.182
We need an anti-Templeton to step forward.

00:28:20.793 --> 00:28:23.976
If my books sold as well
as Stephen Hawking's books,

00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:27.946
instead of only as well as
Richard Dawkins' books, I'd do it myself.

00:28:31.454 --> 00:28:37.752
People are always going on about,
"How did September the 11th change you?"

00:28:38.871 --> 00:28:40.493
Well, here's how it changed me.

00:28:41.469 --> 00:28:45.134
Let's all stop being so damned respectful.

00:28:46.380 --> 00:28:47.976
Thank you very much.

00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:53.000
(Applause)
