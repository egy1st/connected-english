00:00:01.047 --> 00:00:05.976
Imagine a big explosion
as you climb through 3,000 ft.

00:00:06.825 --> 00:00:09.739
Imagine a plane full of smoke.

00:00:10.362 --> 00:00:13.390
Imagine an engine
going clack, clack, clack.

00:00:14.343 --> 00:00:15.723
It sounds scary.

00:00:16.222 --> 00:00:18.083
Well, I had a unique seat that day.

00:00:18.107 --> 00:00:19.826
I was sitting in 1D.

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:22.659
I was the only one who could talk
to the flight attendants.

00:00:23.036 --> 00:00:24.733
So I looked at them right away,

00:00:24.757 --> 00:00:27.735
and they said, "No problem.
We probably hit some birds."

00:00:27.759 --> 00:00:29.931
The pilot had already
turned the plane around,

00:00:29.955 --> 00:00:31.225
and we weren't that far.

00:00:31.249 --> 00:00:32.690
You could see Manhattan.

00:00:34.119 --> 00:00:35.326
Two minutes later,

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:37.218
three things happened at the same time.

00:00:38.896 --> 00:00:41.976
The pilot lines up the plane
with the Hudson River.

00:00:43.193 --> 00:00:44.588
That's usually not the route.

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:46.638
(Laughter)

00:00:46.662 --> 00:00:48.393
He turns off the engines.

00:00:49.402 --> 00:00:51.531
Now, imagine being
in a plane with no sound.

00:00:52.721 --> 00:00:54.874
And then he says three words.

00:00:54.898 --> 00:00:57.276
The most unemotional
three words I've ever heard.

00:00:57.755 --> 00:00:59.388
He says, "Brace for impact."

00:01:01.213 --> 00:01:03.830
I didn't have to talk
to the flight attendant anymore.

00:01:03.854 --> 00:01:05.976
(Laughter)

00:01:06.541 --> 00:01:09.128
I could see in her eyes, it was terror.

00:01:09.152 --> 00:01:10.396
Life was over.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.351
Now I want to share with you three things
I learned about myself that day.

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:18.299
I learned that it
all changes in an instant.

00:01:19.682 --> 00:01:21.404
We have this bucket list,

00:01:21.428 --> 00:01:23.771
we have these things
we want to do in life,

00:01:23.795 --> 00:01:27.312
and I thought about all the people
I wanted to reach out to that I didn't,

00:01:27.336 --> 00:01:29.468
all the fences I wanted to mend,

00:01:29.492 --> 00:01:32.107
all the experiences I wanted
to have and I never did.

00:01:33.263 --> 00:01:35.674
As I thought about that later on,

00:01:35.698 --> 00:01:36.976
I came up with a saying,

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.073
which is, "I collect bad wines."

00:01:40.097 --> 00:01:43.406
Because if the wine is ready
and the person is there, I'm opening it.

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:46.082
I no longer want to postpone
anything in life.

00:01:46.672 --> 00:01:49.889
And that urgency, that purpose,
has really changed my life.

00:01:51.238 --> 00:01:53.320
The second thing I learned that day --

00:01:53.344 --> 00:01:55.976
and this is as we clear
the George Washington Bridge,

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.184
which was by not a lot --

00:01:58.208 --> 00:01:59.783
(Laughter)

00:01:59.807 --> 00:02:03.488
I thought about, wow,
I really feel one real regret.

00:02:03.512 --> 00:02:04.976
I've lived a good life.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.976
In my own humanity and mistakes,

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.834
I've tried to get better
at everything I tried.

00:02:09.858 --> 00:02:12.976
But in my humanity,
I also allow my ego to get in.

00:02:14.042 --> 00:02:18.293
And I regretted the time I wasted
on things that did not matter

00:02:18.317 --> 00:02:19.890
with people that matter.

00:02:20.797 --> 00:02:23.176
And I thought about
my relationship with my wife,

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:24.811
with my friends, with people.

00:02:25.862 --> 00:02:27.803
And after, as I reflected on that,

00:02:27.827 --> 00:02:30.354
I decided to eliminate
negative energy from my life.

00:02:30.378 --> 00:02:32.758
It's not perfect, but it's a lot better.

00:02:32.782 --> 00:02:35.522
I've not had a fight
with my wife in two years.

00:02:35.546 --> 00:02:36.758
It feels great.

00:02:36.782 --> 00:02:39.082
I no longer try to be right;

00:02:39.106 --> 00:02:40.523
I choose to be happy.

00:02:42.054 --> 00:02:43.515
The third thing I learned --

00:02:43.539 --> 00:02:47.980
and this is as your mental clock
starts going, "15, 14, 13."

00:02:48.004 --> 00:02:49.440
You can see the water coming.

00:02:49.464 --> 00:02:50.976
I'm saying, "Please blow up."

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.143
I don't want this thing
to break in 20 pieces

00:02:53.167 --> 00:02:55.189
like you've seen in those documentaries.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.261
And as we're coming down,

00:02:58.285 --> 00:03:02.976
I had a sense of, wow, dying is not scary.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.976
It's almost like we've been preparing
for it our whole lives.

00:03:06.703 --> 00:03:07.931
But it was very sad.

00:03:08.362 --> 00:03:10.322
I didn't want to go; I love my life.

00:03:11.207 --> 00:03:15.432
And that sadness
really framed in one thought,

00:03:15.456 --> 00:03:17.976
which is, I only wish for one thing.

00:03:18.812 --> 00:03:20.853
I only wish I could see my kids grow up.

00:03:22.497 --> 00:03:25.974
About a month later,
I was at a performance by my daughter --

00:03:25.998 --> 00:03:28.705
first-grader, not much artistic talent --

00:03:28.729 --> 00:03:29.803
(Laughter)

00:03:29.827 --> 00:03:30.930
Yet!

00:03:30.954 --> 00:03:32.808
(Laughter)

00:03:32.832 --> 00:03:36.975
And I'm bawling,
I'm crying, like a little kid.

00:03:38.004 --> 00:03:40.176
And it made all the sense
in the world to me.

00:03:40.584 --> 00:03:44.325
I realized at that point,
by connecting those two dots,

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:46.691
that the only thing
that matters in my life

00:03:46.715 --> 00:03:47.976
is being a great dad.

00:03:48.892 --> 00:03:51.599
Above all, above all,

00:03:51.623 --> 00:03:53.991
the only goal I have in life
is to be a good dad.

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:57.845
I was given the gift of a miracle,

00:03:57.869 --> 00:03:59.373
of not dying that day.

00:03:59.397 --> 00:04:01.210
I was given another gift,

00:04:01.234 --> 00:04:03.761
which was to be able
to see into the future

00:04:03.785 --> 00:04:05.062
and come back

00:04:05.086 --> 00:04:07.138
and live differently.

00:04:07.898 --> 00:04:10.890
I challenge you guys
that are flying today,

00:04:10.914 --> 00:04:13.565
imagine the same thing
happens on your plane --

00:04:13.589 --> 00:04:14.976
and please don't --

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.593
but imagine, and how would you change?

00:04:17.617 --> 00:04:18.897
What would you get done

00:04:18.921 --> 00:04:22.597
that you're waiting to get done
because you think you'll be here forever?

00:04:22.621 --> 00:04:24.568
How would you change your relationships

00:04:24.592 --> 00:04:26.276
and the negative energy in them?

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:29.276
And more than anything,
are you being the best parent you can?

00:04:29.744 --> 00:04:30.777
Thank you.

00:04:30.801 --> 00:04:33.801
(Applause)
