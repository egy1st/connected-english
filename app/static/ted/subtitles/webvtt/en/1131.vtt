00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
How would you like to be better than you are?

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Suppose I said

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
that, with just a few changes in your genes,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
you could get a better memory --

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
more precise,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
more accurate and quicker.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Or maybe you'd like to be more fit, stronger,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
with more stamina.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Would you like to be more attractive and self-confident?

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
How about living longer with good health?

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Or perhaps you're one of those

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
who's always yearned for more creativity.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
Which one would you like the most?

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Which would you like, if you could have just one?

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
(Audience Member: Creativity.)

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Creativity.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
How many people would choose creativity?

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
Raise your hands. Let me see.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
A few. Probably about as many as there are creative people here.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
(Laughter) That's very good.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
How many would opt for memory?

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
Quite a few more.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
How about fitness?

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
A few less.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
What about longevity?

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
Ah, the majority. That makes me feel very good as a doctor.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
If you could have any one of these,

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
it would be a very different world.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
Is it just imaginary?

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
Or, is it, perhaps, possible?

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
Evolution has been a perennial topic

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
here at the TED Conference,

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
but I want to give you today

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
one doctor's take on the subject.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
The great 20th-century geneticist,

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
T.G. Dobzhansky,

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
who was also a communicant

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
in the Russian Orthodox Church,

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
once wrote an essay that he titled

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
"Nothing in Biology Makes Sense

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
Except in the Light of Evolution."

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
Now if you are one of those

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
who does not accept the evidence for biological evolution,

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
this would be a very good time to turn off your hearing aid,

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
take out your personal communications device --

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
I give you permission --

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
and perhaps take another look at Kathryn Schultz's book on being wrong,

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
because nothing in the rest of this talk

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
is going to make any sense whatsoever to you.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
(Laughter)

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
But if you do accept

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
biological evolution,

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
consider this:

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
is it just about the past,

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
or is it about the future?

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
Does it apply to others,

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
or does it apply to us?

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
This is another look at the tree of life.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
In this picture,

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
I've put a bush with a center branching out in all directions,

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
because if you look at the edges

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
of the tree of life,

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
every existing species

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
at the tips of those branches

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
has succeeded in evolutionary terms:

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
it has survived;

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
it has demonstrated a fitness

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
to its environment.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000
The human part of this branch,

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
way out on one end,

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.000
is, of course, the one that we are most interested in.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
We branch off of a common ancestor

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
to modern chimpanzees

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000
about six or eight million years ago.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
In the interval,

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
there have been perhaps 20 or 25

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
different species of hominids.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000
Some have come and gone.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.000
We have been here for about 130,000 years.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000
It may seem like we're quite remote

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000
from other parts of this tree of life,

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000
but actually, for the most part,

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000
the basic machinery of our cells

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000
is pretty much the same.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.000
Do you realize that we can take advantage

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000
and commandeer the machinery of a common bacterium

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000
to produce the protein of human insulin

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000
used to treat diabetics?

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000
This is not like human insulin;

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000
this is the same protein

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000
that is chemically indistinguishable

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.000
from what comes out of your pancreas.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000
And speaking of bacteria,

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.000
do you realize that each of us carries in our gut

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000
more bacteria

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000
than there are cells in the rest of our body?

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
Maybe 10 times more.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000
I mean think of it,

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.000
when Antonio Damasio asks about your self-image,

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.000
do you think about the bacteria?

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000
Our gut is a wonderfully hospitable environment

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000
for those bacteria.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000
It's warm, it's dark, it's moist,

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000
it's very cozy.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000
And you're going to provide all the nutrition that they could possibly want

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000
with no effort on their part.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.000
It's really like an Easy Street for bacteria,

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.000
with the occasional interruption

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000
of the unintended forced rush to the exit.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.000
But otherwise,

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.000
you are a wonderful environment for those bacteria,

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.000
just as they are essential to your life.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.000
They help in the digestion of essential nutrients,

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.000
and they protect you against certain diseases.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000
But what will come in the future?

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.000
Are we at some kind of evolutionary equipoise

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000
as a species?

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000
Or, are we destined

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000
to become something different --

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.000
something, perhaps, even better adapted

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000
to the environment?

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000
Now let's take a step back in time

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000
to the Big Bang, 14 billion years ago --

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000
the Earth, the solar system,

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.000
about four and a half billion years --

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000
the first signs of proto-life,

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000
maybe three to four billion years ago on Earth --

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.000
the first multi-celled organisms,

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000
perhaps as much

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.000
as 800 or a billion years ago --

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000
and then the human species,

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000
finally emerging

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000
in the last 130,000 years.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.000
In this vast unfinished symphony of the universe,

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.000
life on Earth is like a brief measure;

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000
the animal kingdom,

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.000
like a single measure;

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000
and human life,

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.000
a small grace note.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.000
That was us.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000
That also constitutes the entertainment portion of this talk,

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.000
so I hope you enjoyed it.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000
(Laughter)

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.000
Now when I was a freshman in college,

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000
I took my first biology class.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.000
I was fascinated

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.000
by the elegance and beauty of biology.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.000
I became enamored of the power of evolution,

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000
and I realized something very fundamental:

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000
in most of the existence of life

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.000
in single-celled organisms,

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.000
each cell simply divides,

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.000
and all of the genetic energy of that cell

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.000
is carried on in both daughter cells.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:28.000
But at the time multi-celled organisms come online,

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000
things start to change.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.000
Sexual reproduction enters the picture.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.000
And very importantly,

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.000
with the introduction of sexual reproduction

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.000
that passes on the genome,

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000
the rest of the body

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000
becomes expendable.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.000
In fact, you could say

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.000
that the inevitability of the death of our bodies

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.000
enters in evolutionary time

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000
at the same moment

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000
as sexual reproduction.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.000
Now I have to confess,

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000
when I was a college undergraduate,

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:04.000
I thought, okay, sex/death, sex/death, death for sex --

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:07.000
it seemed pretty reasonable at the time,

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000
but with each passing year,

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000
I've come to have increasing doubts.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.000
I've come to understand the sentiments of George Burns,

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.000
who was performing still in Las Vegas

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.000
well into his 90s.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.000
And one night, there's a knock at his hotel room door.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.000
He answers the door.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:25.000
Standing before him is a gorgeous, scantily clad showgirl.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.000
She looks at him and says,

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.000
"I'm here for super sex."

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.000
"That's fine," says George, "I'll take the soup."

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:37.000
(Laughter)

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.000
I came to realize,

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.000
as a physician,

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:44.000
that I was working toward a goal

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:47.000
which was different from the goal of evolution --

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:50.000
not necessarily contradictory, just different.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000
I was trying to preserve the body.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000
I wanted to keep us healthy.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.000
I wanted to restore health from disease.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:00.000
I wanted us to live long and healthy lives.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.000
Evolution is all about passing on the genome

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.000
to the next generation,

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:08.000
adapting and surviving

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.000
through generation after generation.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:13.000
From an evolutionary point of view,

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.000
you and I are like the booster rockets

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.000
designed to send the genetic payload

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.000
into the next level of orbit

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:22.000
and then drop off into the sea.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:25.000
I think we would all understand the sentiment that Woody Allen expressed

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:29.000
when he said, "I don't want to achieve immortality through my work.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000
I want to achieve it through not dying."

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:34.000
(Laughter)

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:37.000
Evolution does not necessarily

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.000
favor the longest-lived.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.000
It doesn't necessarily favor the biggest

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.000
or the strongest or the fastest,

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.000
and not even the smartest.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.000
Evolution favors

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:50.000
those creatures best adapted

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.000
to their environment.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.000
That is the sole test

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.000
of survival and success.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.000
At the bottom of the ocean,

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.000
bacteria that are thermophilic

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.000
and can survive at the steam vent heat

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:06.000
that would otherwise produce, if fish were there,

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.000
sous-vide cooked fish,

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.000
nevertheless, have managed

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:15.000
to make that a hospitable environment for them.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:18.000
So what does this mean,

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:21.000
as we look back at what has happened in evolution,

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:24.000
and as we think about the place again

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:27.000
of humans in evolution,

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:30.000
and particularly as we look ahead

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.000
to the next phase,

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.000
I would say

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:37.000
that there are a number of possibilities.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:42.000
The first is that we will not evolve.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:44.000
We have reached

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.000
a kind of equipoise.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.000
And the reasoning behind that would be,

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:51.000
first, we have, through medicine,

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.000
managed to preserve a lot of genes

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.000
that would otherwise be selected out

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.000
and be removed from the population.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.000
And secondly, we as a species

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:02.000
have so configured our environment

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:05.000
that we have managed to make it adapt to us

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:08.000
as well as we adapt to it.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.000
And by the way, we immigrate and circulate

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.000
and intermix so much

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.000
that you can't any longer

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.000
have the isolation that is necessary

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:19.000
for evolution to take place.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.000
A second possibility

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:24.000
is that there will be evolution of the traditional kind,

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:29.000
natural, imposed by the forces of nature.

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.000
And the argument here would be

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:34.000
that the wheels of evolution grind slowly,

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.000
but they are inexorable.

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.000
And as far as isolation goes,

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.000
when we as a species

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.000
do colonize distant planets,

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:45.000
there will be the isolation and the environmental changes

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:48.000
that could produce evolution

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.000
in the natural way.

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.000
But there's a third possibility,

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:55.000
an enticing, intriguing and frightening possibility.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.000
I call it neo-evolution --

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.000
the new evolution

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.000
that is not simply natural,

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:04.000
but guided and chosen

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:07.000
by us as individuals

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.000
in the choices that we will make.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:12.000
Now how could this come about?

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:15.000
How could it be possible that we would do this?

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:18.000
Consider, first, the reality

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:21.000
that people today, in some cultures,

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:24.000
are making choices about their offspring.

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.000
They're, in some cultures,

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:29.000
choosing to have more males than females.

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.000
It's not necessarily good for the society,

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:35.000
but it's what the individual and the family are choosing.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:37.000
Think also,

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:41.000
if it were possible ever

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:44.000
for you to choose, not simply to choose the sex of your child,

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:47.000
but for you in your body

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:50.000
to make the genetic adjustments

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.000
that would cure or prevent diseases.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:55.000
What if you could make the genetic changes

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:58.000
to eliminate diabetes or Alzheimer's

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.000
or reduce the risk of cancer

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.000
or eliminate stroke?

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.000
Wouldn't you want

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.000
to make those changes

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.000
in your genes?

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.000
If we look ahead,

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.000
these kind of changes

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:17.000
are going to be increasingly possible.

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:19.000
The Human Genome Project

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:21.000
started in 1990,

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:23.000
and it took 13 years.

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:28.000
It cost 2.7 billion dollars.

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:31.000
The year after it was finished in 2004,

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:33.000
you could do the same job

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:36.000
for 20 million dollars in three to four months.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:39.000
Today, you can have a complete sequence

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:41.000
of the three billion base pairs in the human genome

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:44.000
at a cost of about 20,000 dollars

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:46.000
and in the space of about a week.

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.000
It won't be very long

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.000
before the reality will be

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:52.000
the 1,000-dollar human genome,

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:55.000
and it will be increasingly available for everyone.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.000
Just a week ago,

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.000
the National Academy of Engineering

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.000
awarded its Draper Prize

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:04.000
to Francis Arnold and Willem Stemmer,

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:08.000
two scientists who independently developed techniques

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:12.000
to encourage the natural process of evolution to work faster

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.000
and to lead to desirable proteins

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.000
in a more efficient way --

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:20.000
what Frances Arnold calls "directed evolution."

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:23.000
A couple of years ago, the Lasker Prize

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:26.000
was awarded to the scientist Shinya Yamanaka

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:28.000
for his research

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.000
in which he took an adult skin cell,

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.000
a fibroblast,

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:35.000
and by manipulating just four genes,

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:37.000
he induced that cell

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:41.000
to revert to a pluripotential stem cell --

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:44.000
a cell potentially capable

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:47.000
of becoming any cell in your body.

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:49.000
These changes are coming.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:51.000
The same technology

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:53.000
that has produced the human insulin in bacteria

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.000
can make viruses

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:58.000
that will not only protect you against themselves,

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:00.000
but induce immunity against other viruses.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.000
Believe it or not,

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.000
there's an experimental trial going on

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:07.000
with vaccine against influenza

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:11.000
that has been grown in the cells of a tobacco plant.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:15.000
Can you imagine something good coming out of tobacco?

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:18.000
These are all reality today,

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:21.000
and [in] the future, will be evermore possible.

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:23.000
Imagine then

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:26.000
just two other little changes.

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.000
You can change the cells in your body,

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:32.000
but what if you could change the cells in your offspring?

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.000
What if you could change the sperm and the ova,

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:37.000
or change the newly fertilized egg,

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.000
and give your offspring a better chance

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:41.000
at a healthier life --

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:43.000
eliminate the diabetes, eliminate the hemophilia,

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:45.000
reduce the risk of cancer?

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:48.000
Who doesn't want healthier children?

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:51.000
And then, that same analytic technology,

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:53.000
that same engine of science

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:55.000
that can produce

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:57.000
the changes to prevent disease,

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:00.000
will also enable us

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.000
to adopt super-attributes,

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:04.000
hyper-capacities --

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:06.000
that better memory.

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:08.000
Why not have the quick wit

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:10.000
of a Ken Jennings,

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:12.000
especially if you can augment it

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:15.000
with the next generation of the Watson machine?

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:18.000
Why not have the quick twitch muscle

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:21.000
that will enable you to run faster and longer?

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:25.000
Why not live longer?

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:27.000
These will be irresistible.

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:30.000
And when we are at a position

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:32.000
where we can pass it on to the next generation,

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:35.000
and we can adopt the attributes we want,

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:38.000
we will have converted

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:40.000
old-style evolution

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:42.000
into neo-evolution.

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:44.000
We'll take a process

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:46.000
that normally might require 100,000 years,

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:49.000
and we can compress it down to a thousand years --

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:52.000
and maybe even in the next 100 years.

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:54.000
These are choices

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:56.000
that your grandchildren,

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:58.000
or their grandchildren,

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:01.000
are going to have before them.

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:04.000
Will we use these choices

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:07.000
to make a society that is better,

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:10.000
that is more successful, that is kinder?

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:13.000
Or, will we selectively choose different attributes

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:15.000
that we want for some of us

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:17.000
and not for others of us?

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:20.000
Will we make a society

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:23.000
that is more boring and more uniform,

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:26.000
or more robust and more versatile?

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:28.000
These are the kinds of questions

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:30.000
that we will have to face.

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:32.000
And most profoundly of all,

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:35.000
will we ever be able to develop the wisdom,

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:37.000
and to inherit the wisdom,

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:40.000
that we'll need to make these choices wisely?

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:42.000
For better or worse,

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:44.000
and sooner than you may think,

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:47.000
these choices will be up to us.

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:49.000
Thank you.

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:59.000
(Applause)
