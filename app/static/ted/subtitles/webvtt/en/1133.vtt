00:00:00.547 --> 00:00:03.714
I thought I'd talk a little bit
about how nature makes materials.

00:00:03.738 --> 00:00:05.928
I brought along with me an abalone shell.

00:00:05.952 --> 00:00:08.527
This abalone shell
is a biocomposite material

00:00:08.551 --> 00:00:11.400
that's 98 percent by mass
calcium carbonate

00:00:11.424 --> 00:00:13.955
and two percent by mass protein.

00:00:13.979 --> 00:00:17.675
Yet, it's 3,000 times tougher
than its geological counterpart.

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:21.138
And a lot of people might use
structures like abalone shells,

00:00:21.162 --> 00:00:22.314
like chalk.

00:00:22.338 --> 00:00:25.129
I've been fascinated
by how nature makes materials,

00:00:25.153 --> 00:00:28.508
and there's a lot of secrets
to how they do such an exquisite job.

00:00:28.532 --> 00:00:32.800
Part of it is that these materials
are macroscopic in structure,

00:00:32.824 --> 00:00:34.683
but they're formed at the nano scale.

00:00:34.707 --> 00:00:36.375
They're formed at the nano scale,

00:00:36.399 --> 00:00:40.032
and they use proteins
that are coded by the genetic level

00:00:40.056 --> 00:00:42.865
that allow them to build
these really exquisite structures.

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:45.121
So something I think
is very fascinating is:

00:00:45.145 --> 00:00:49.402
What if you could give life
to non-living structures,

00:00:49.426 --> 00:00:51.676
like batteries and like solar cells?

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:53.984
What if they had
some of the same capabilities

00:00:54.008 --> 00:00:55.676
that an abalone shell did,

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:59.382
in terms of being able
to build really exquisite structures

00:00:59.406 --> 00:01:01.239
at room temperature and room pressure,

00:01:01.263 --> 00:01:03.308
using nontoxic chemicals

00:01:03.332 --> 00:01:06.031
and adding no toxic materials
back into the environment?

00:01:06.055 --> 00:01:09.313
So that's kind of the vision
that I've been thinking about.

00:01:09.337 --> 00:01:12.003
And so what if you could grow
a battery in a Petri dish?

00:01:12.027 --> 00:01:14.917
Or what if you could give
genetic information to a battery

00:01:14.941 --> 00:01:18.743
so that it could actually become
better as a function of time, and do so

00:01:18.767 --> 00:01:20.544
in an environmentally friendly way?

00:01:20.935 --> 00:01:24.006
And so, going back to this abalone shell,

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:27.095
besides being nanostructured,
one thing that's fascinating is,

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:29.587
when a male and female
abalone get together,

00:01:29.611 --> 00:01:31.816
they pass on the genetic
information that says,

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:34.276
"This is how to build
an exquisite material.

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:36.800
Here's how to do it at room
temperature and pressure,

00:01:36.824 --> 00:01:38.130
using nontoxic materials."

00:01:38.154 --> 00:01:40.318
Same with diatoms,
which are shown right here,

00:01:40.342 --> 00:01:41.965
which are glasseous structures.

00:01:41.989 --> 00:01:43.676
Every time the diatoms replicate,

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:45.766
they give the genetic
information that says,

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:49.454
"Here's how to build glass in the ocean
that's perfectly nanostructured."

00:01:49.478 --> 00:01:51.771
And you can do it the same,
over and over again."

00:01:51.795 --> 00:01:55.115
So what if you could do the same thing
with a solar cell or a battery?

00:01:55.139 --> 00:01:58.676
I like to say my favorite
biomaterial is my four year old.

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:01.937
But anyone who's ever had
or knows small children knows,

00:02:01.961 --> 00:02:03.977
they're incredibly complex organisms.

00:02:04.001 --> 00:02:07.697
If you wanted to convince them to do
something they don't want to do,

00:02:07.721 --> 00:02:08.879
it's very difficult.

00:02:08.903 --> 00:02:10.919
So when we think
about future technologies,

00:02:10.943 --> 00:02:14.161
we actually think of using
bacteria and viruses --

00:02:14.185 --> 00:02:15.393
simple organisms.

00:02:15.417 --> 00:02:18.073
Can you convince them
to work with a new toolbox,

00:02:18.097 --> 00:02:21.347
so they can build a structure
that will be important to me?

00:02:21.371 --> 00:02:23.672
Also, when we think
about future technologies,

00:02:23.696 --> 00:02:25.909
we start with the beginning of Earth.

00:02:25.933 --> 00:02:29.676
Basically, it took a billion years
to have life on Earth.

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:31.811
And very rapidly,
they became multi-cellular,

00:02:31.835 --> 00:02:34.412
they could replicate,
they could use photosynthesis

00:02:34.436 --> 00:02:36.373
as a way of getting their energy source.

00:02:36.397 --> 00:02:38.739
But it wasn't until about 500
million years ago --

00:02:38.763 --> 00:02:40.795
during the Cambrian
geologic time period --

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:43.864
that organisms in the ocean
started making hard materials.

00:02:43.888 --> 00:02:47.452
Before that, they were all
soft, fluffy structures.

00:02:47.476 --> 00:02:50.164
It was during this time
that there was increased calcium,

00:02:50.188 --> 00:02:52.044
iron and silicon in the environment,

00:02:52.068 --> 00:02:55.310
and organisms learned
how to make hard materials.

00:02:55.334 --> 00:02:57.525
So that's what I would like
to be able to do,

00:02:57.549 --> 00:03:01.176
convince biology to work
with the rest of the periodic table.

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:03.388
Now, if you look at biology,

00:03:03.412 --> 00:03:07.230
there's many structures like DNA,
antibodies, proteins and ribosomes

00:03:07.254 --> 00:03:08.454
you've heard about,

00:03:08.478 --> 00:03:09.924
that are nanostructured --

00:03:09.948 --> 00:03:13.456
nature already gives us really exquisite
structures on the nano scale.

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:15.179
What if we could harness them

00:03:15.203 --> 00:03:19.901
and convince them to not be an antibody
that does something like HIV?

00:03:19.925 --> 00:03:23.301
What if we could convince them
to build a solar cell for us?

00:03:24.074 --> 00:03:25.424
Here are some examples.

00:03:25.448 --> 00:03:27.605
Natural shells,
natural biological materials.

00:03:27.629 --> 00:03:28.821
The abalone shell here.

00:03:28.845 --> 00:03:32.232
If you fracture it, you can look
at the fact that it's nanostructured.

00:03:32.256 --> 00:03:34.384
There's diatoms made out of SiO2,

00:03:34.408 --> 00:03:36.266
and there are magnetotactic bacteria

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:39.676
that make small, single-domain
magnets used for navigation.

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:41.368
What all these have in common

00:03:41.392 --> 00:03:43.949
is these materials
are structured at the nano scale,

00:03:43.973 --> 00:03:47.299
and they have a DNA sequence
that codes for a protein sequence

00:03:47.323 --> 00:03:48.829
that gives them the blueprint

00:03:48.853 --> 00:03:51.676
to be able to build
these really wonderful structures.

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:53.882
Now, going back to the abalone shell,

00:03:53.906 --> 00:03:56.486
the abalone makes this shell
by having these proteins.

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:58.534
These proteins
are very negatively charged.

00:03:58.558 --> 00:04:00.733
They can pull calcium
out of the environment,

00:04:00.757 --> 00:04:04.296
and put down a layer of calcium
and then carbonate, calcium and carbonate.

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:07.213
It has the chemical sequences
of amino acids which says,

00:04:07.237 --> 00:04:08.960
"This is how to build the structure.

00:04:08.984 --> 00:04:11.428
Here's the DNA sequence,
here's the protein sequence

00:04:11.452 --> 00:04:12.603
in order to do it."

00:04:12.627 --> 00:04:13.874
So an interesting idea is,

00:04:13.898 --> 00:04:16.151
what if you could take
any material you wanted,

00:04:16.175 --> 00:04:17.953
or any element on the periodic table,

00:04:17.977 --> 00:04:20.335
and find its corresponding DNA sequence,

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:24.046
then code it for a corresponding
protein sequence to build a structure,

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:25.706
but not build an abalone shell --

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:30.304
build something that nature has never had
the opportunity to work with yet.

00:04:30.954 --> 00:04:33.272
And so here's the periodic table.

00:04:33.296 --> 00:04:35.083
I absolutely love the periodic table.

00:04:35.107 --> 00:04:37.732
Every year for the incoming
freshman class at MIT,

00:04:37.756 --> 00:04:39.683
I have a periodic table made that says,

00:04:39.707 --> 00:04:41.844
"Welcome to MIT.
Now you're in your element."

00:04:41.868 --> 00:04:42.877
(Laughter)

00:04:42.901 --> 00:04:45.190
And you flip it over,
and it's the amino acids

00:04:45.214 --> 00:04:47.676
with the pH at which they have
different charges.

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:50.676
And so I give this out
to thousands of people.

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:52.796
And I know it says MIT
and this is Caltech,

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:54.884
but I have a couple extra
if people want it.

00:04:54.908 --> 00:04:59.227
I was really fortunate to have
President Obama visit my lab this year

00:04:59.251 --> 00:05:00.640
on his visit to MIT,

00:05:00.664 --> 00:05:02.962
and I really wanted to give
him a periodic table.

00:05:02.986 --> 00:05:05.328
So I stayed up at night
and talked to my husband,

00:05:05.352 --> 00:05:07.608
"How do I give President Obama
a periodic table?

00:05:07.632 --> 00:05:09.700
What if he says,
'Oh, I already have one,'

00:05:09.724 --> 00:05:11.364
or, 'I've already memorized it?'"

00:05:11.388 --> 00:05:12.396
(Laughter)

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:15.700
So he came to visit my lab and looked
around -- it was a great visit.

00:05:15.724 --> 00:05:17.058
And then afterward, I said,

00:05:17.082 --> 00:05:19.445
"Sir, I want to give you
the periodic table,

00:05:19.469 --> 00:05:22.832
in case you're ever in a bind
and need to calculate molecular weight."

00:05:22.856 --> 00:05:23.942
(Laughter)

00:05:23.966 --> 00:05:27.480
I thought "molecular weight" sounded
much less nerdy than "molar mass."

00:05:27.504 --> 00:05:28.575
(Laughter)

00:05:28.599 --> 00:05:31.498
And he looked at it and said,

00:05:31.522 --> 00:05:33.536
"Thank you. I'll look at it periodically."

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:35.676
(Laughter)

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:39.676
(Applause)

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:42.676
Later in a lecture
that he gave on clean energy,

00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:44.000
he pulled it out and said,

00:05:44.024 --> 00:05:46.762
"And people at MIT,
they give out periodic tables." So ...

00:05:46.786 --> 00:05:49.094
So basically what I didn't tell you

00:05:49.118 --> 00:05:52.719
is that about 500 million years ago,
the organisms started making materials,

00:05:52.743 --> 00:05:55.577
but it took them about 50 million years
to get good at it --

00:05:55.601 --> 00:05:59.048
50 million years to learn how to perfect
how to make that abalone shell.

00:05:59.072 --> 00:06:01.196
And that's a hard sell
to a graduate student:

00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:03.757
"I have this great project ...
50 million years ..."

00:06:03.781 --> 00:06:07.285
So we had to develop a way
of trying to do this more rapidly.

00:06:07.309 --> 00:06:12.062
And so we use a nontoxic virus
called M13 bacteriophage,

00:06:12.086 --> 00:06:14.043
whose job is to infect bacteria.

00:06:14.067 --> 00:06:15.773
Well, it has a simple DNA structure

00:06:15.797 --> 00:06:19.925
that you can go in and cut and paste
additional DNA sequences into it,

00:06:19.949 --> 00:06:24.442
and by doing that, it allows the virus
to express random protein sequences.

00:06:24.466 --> 00:06:26.379
This is pretty easy biotechnology,

00:06:26.403 --> 00:06:28.650
and you could basically
do this a billion times.

00:06:28.674 --> 00:06:30.984
So you can have
a billion different viruses

00:06:31.008 --> 00:06:32.715
that are all genetically identical,

00:06:32.739 --> 00:06:35.177
but they differ from each other
based on their tips,

00:06:35.201 --> 00:06:36.802
on one sequence,

00:06:36.826 --> 00:06:38.315
that codes for one protein.

00:06:38.339 --> 00:06:42.093
Now if you take all billion viruses,
and put them in one drop of liquid,

00:06:42.117 --> 00:06:44.626
you can force them to interact
with anything you want

00:06:44.650 --> 00:06:45.831
on the periodic table.

00:06:45.855 --> 00:06:47.972
And through a process
of selection evolution,

00:06:47.996 --> 00:06:51.300
you can pull one of a billion
that does something you'd like it to do,

00:06:51.324 --> 00:06:53.078
like grow a battery or a solar cell.

00:06:53.102 --> 00:06:56.138
Basically, viruses can't replicate
themselves; they need a host.

00:06:56.162 --> 00:06:58.126
Once you find that one out of a billion,

00:06:58.150 --> 00:07:01.587
you infect it into a bacteria,
and make millions and billions of copies

00:07:01.611 --> 00:07:02.999
of that particular sequence.

00:07:03.023 --> 00:07:05.201
The other thing
that's beautiful about biology

00:07:05.225 --> 00:07:08.367
is that biology gives you
really exquisite structures

00:07:08.391 --> 00:07:09.676
with nice link scales.

00:07:09.700 --> 00:07:11.511
These viruses are long and skinny,

00:07:11.535 --> 00:07:13.700
and we can get them to express the ability

00:07:13.724 --> 00:07:15.676
to grow something like semiconductors

00:07:15.700 --> 00:07:17.806
or materials for batteries.

00:07:17.830 --> 00:07:20.676
Now, this is a high-powered
battery that we grew in my lab.

00:07:20.700 --> 00:07:23.413
We engineered a virus
to pick up carbon nanotubes.

00:07:23.437 --> 00:07:25.676
One part of the virus
grabs a carbon nanotube,

00:07:25.700 --> 00:07:27.785
the other part of the virus has a sequence

00:07:27.809 --> 00:07:30.433
that can grow an electrode
material for a battery,

00:07:30.457 --> 00:07:33.156
and then it wires itself
to the current collector.

00:07:33.180 --> 00:07:35.676
And so through a process
of selection evolution,

00:07:35.700 --> 00:07:38.842
we went from being able to have
a virus that made a crummy battery

00:07:38.866 --> 00:07:40.547
to a virus that made a good battery

00:07:40.571 --> 00:07:43.443
to a virus that made a record-breaking,
high-powered battery

00:07:43.467 --> 00:07:46.634
that's all made at room temperature,
basically at the benchtop.

00:07:46.658 --> 00:07:50.128
That battery went to the White House
for a press conference,

00:07:50.152 --> 00:07:51.563
and I brought it here.

00:07:51.587 --> 00:07:54.366
You can see it in this case
that's lighting this LED.

00:07:54.390 --> 00:07:56.445
Now if we could scale this,

00:07:56.469 --> 00:08:00.429
you could actually use it
to run your Prius,

00:08:00.453 --> 00:08:03.797
which is kind of my dream --
to be able to drive a virus-powered car.

00:08:03.821 --> 00:08:04.938
(Laughter)

00:08:04.962 --> 00:08:09.676
But basically you can pull
one out of a billion,

00:08:09.700 --> 00:08:11.618
and make lots of amplifications to it.

00:08:11.642 --> 00:08:13.915
Basically, you make
an amplification in the lab,

00:08:13.939 --> 00:08:17.233
and then you get it to self-assemble
into a structure like a battery.

00:08:17.257 --> 00:08:19.523
We're able to do this also with catalysis.

00:08:19.547 --> 00:08:23.478
This is the example
of a photocatalytic splitting of water.

00:08:23.502 --> 00:08:26.490
And what we've been able to do
is engineer a virus

00:08:26.514 --> 00:08:28.800
to basically take dye-absorbing molecules

00:08:28.824 --> 00:08:30.879
and line them up
on the surface of the virus

00:08:30.903 --> 00:08:32.214
so it acts as an antenna,

00:08:32.238 --> 00:08:34.911
and you get an energy transfer
across the virus.

00:08:34.935 --> 00:08:38.198
And then we give it a second gene
to grow an inorganic material

00:08:38.222 --> 00:08:42.214
that can be used to split water
into oxygen and hydrogen,

00:08:42.238 --> 00:08:44.452
that can be used for clean fuels.

00:08:44.476 --> 00:08:46.552
I brought an example
of that with me today.

00:08:46.576 --> 00:08:48.394
My students promised me it would work.

00:08:48.418 --> 00:08:50.845
These are virus-assembled nanowires.

00:08:50.869 --> 00:08:53.676
When you shine light on them,
you can see them bubbling.

00:08:53.700 --> 00:08:56.635
In this case, you're seeing
oxygen bubbles come out.

00:08:56.659 --> 00:08:57.968
(Applause)

00:08:57.992 --> 00:09:00.676
Basically, by controlling the genes,

00:09:00.700 --> 00:09:04.034
you can control multiple materials
to improve your device performance.

00:09:04.058 --> 00:09:05.764
The last example are solar cells.

00:09:05.788 --> 00:09:07.603
You can also do this with solar cells.

00:09:07.627 --> 00:09:10.889
We've been able to engineer viruses
to pick up carbon nanotubes

00:09:10.913 --> 00:09:15.016
and then grow titanium
dioxide around them,

00:09:15.040 --> 00:09:19.059
and use it as a way of getting
electrons through the device.

00:09:19.083 --> 00:09:21.547
And what we've found
is through genetic engineering,

00:09:21.571 --> 00:09:26.374
we can actually increase
the efficiencies of these solar cells

00:09:26.398 --> 00:09:28.375
to record numbers

00:09:28.399 --> 00:09:31.676
for these types of dye-sensitized systems.

00:09:31.700 --> 00:09:33.676
And I brought one of those as well,

00:09:33.700 --> 00:09:36.878
that you can play around
with outside afterward.

00:09:36.902 --> 00:09:38.767
So this is a virus-based solar cell.

00:09:38.791 --> 00:09:40.676
Through evolution and selection,

00:09:40.700 --> 00:09:44.196
we took it from an eight percent
efficiency solar cell

00:09:44.220 --> 00:09:46.304
to an 11 percent efficiency solar cell.

00:09:46.328 --> 00:09:48.161
So I hope that I've convinced you

00:09:48.185 --> 00:09:52.052
that there's a lot of great,
interesting things to be learned

00:09:52.076 --> 00:09:53.676
about how nature makes materials,

00:09:53.700 --> 00:09:55.351
and about taking it the next step,

00:09:55.375 --> 00:09:59.872
to see if you can force or take advantage
of how nature makes materials,

00:09:59.896 --> 00:10:02.577
to make things that nature
hasn't yet dreamed of making.

00:10:02.601 --> 00:10:03.752
Thank you.

00:10:03.776 --> 00:10:04.926
(Applause)
