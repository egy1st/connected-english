00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
So for the past year and a half,

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
my team at Push Pop Press

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
and Charlie Melcher and Melcher Media

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
have been working on creating

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
the first feature-length interactive book.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
It's called "Our Choice"

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
and the author is Al Gore.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
It's the sequel to "An Inconvenient Truth,"

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
and it explores all the solutions

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
that will solve the climate crisis.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
The book starts like this. This is the cover.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
As the globe spins,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
we can see our location,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
and we can open the book

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
and swipe through the chapters

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
to browse the book.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Or, we can scroll through the pages at the bottom.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
And if we wanted to zoom into a page,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
we can just open it up.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
And anything you see in the book,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
you can pick up with two fingers

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
and lift off the page

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
and open up.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
And if you want to go back

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
and read the book again,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
you just fold it back up and put it back on the page.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
And so this works the same way; you pick it up and pop it open.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
(Audio) Al Gore: I consider myself

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
among the majority

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
who look at windmills and feel

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
they're a beautiful addition to the landscape.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
Mike Matas: And so throughout the whole book,

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
Al Gore will walk you through and explain the photos.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
This photo, you can you can even see on an interactive map.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
Zoom into it and see where it was taken.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
And throughout the book,

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
there's over an hour of documentary footage

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
and interactive animations.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
So you can open this one.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
(Audio) AG: Most modern wind turbines consist of a large ...

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
MM: It starts playing immediately.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
And while it's playing, we can pinch and peak back at the page,

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
and the movie keeps playing.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
Or we can zoom out to the table of contents,

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
and the video keeps playing.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
But one of the coolest things in this book

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
are the interactive infographics.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
This one shows the wind potential

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
all around the United States.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
But instead of just showing us the information,

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
we can take our finger and explore,

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
and see, state by state,

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
exactly how much wind potential there is.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
We can do the same for geothermal energy

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
and solar power.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
This is one of my favorites.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000
So this shows ...

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.000
(Laughter)

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
(Applause)

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
When the wind is blowing,

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000
any excess energy coming from the windmill

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
is diverted into the battery.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
And as the wind starts dying down,

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
any excess energy will be diverted back into the house --

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000
the lights never go out.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000
And this whole book, it doesn't just run on the iPad.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000
It also runs on the iPhone.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
And so you can start reading on your iPad in your living room

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000
and then pick up where you left off on the iPhone.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000
And it works the exact same way.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000
You can pinch into any page.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
Open it up.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000
So that's Push Pop Press' first title,

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
Al Gore's "Our Choice."

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000
Thank you.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:37.000
(Applause)

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.000
Chris Anderson: That's spectacular.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000
Do you want to be a publisher,

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000
a technology licenser?

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000
What is the business here?

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000
Is this something that other people can do?

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000
MM: Yeah, we're building a tool

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.000
that makes it really easy for publishers right now to build this content.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000
So Melcher Media's team, who's on the East coast --

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.000
and we're on the West coast, building the software --

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000
takes our tool

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000
and, every day, drags in images and text.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000
CA: So you want to license this software to publishers

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000
to make books as beautiful as that? (MM: Yes.)

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000
All right. Mike, thanks so much.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000
MM: Thank you. (CA: Good luck.)

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000
(Applause)
