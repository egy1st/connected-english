00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
My name is Arvind Gupta, and I'm a toymaker.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
I've been making toys for the last 30 years.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
The early '70s, I was in college.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
It was a very revolutionary time.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
It was a political ferment, so to say --

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
students out in the streets of Paris,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
revolting against authority.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
America was jolted

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
by the anti-Vietnam movement, the Civil Rights movement.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
In India, we had the Naxalite movement,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
the [unclear] movement.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
But you know, when there is a political churning of society,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
it unleashes a lot of energy.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
The National Movement of India

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
was testimony to that.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Lots of people resigned from well-paid jobs

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
and jumped into the National Movement.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
Now in the early '70s,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
one of the great programs in India

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
was to revitalize

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
primary science in village schools.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
There was a person, Anil Sadgopal, did a Ph.D. from Caltech

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
and returned back as a molecular biologist

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
in India's cutting-edge research institute, the TIFR.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
At 31, he was not able

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
to relate the kind of [unclear] research,

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
which he was doing with the lives of the ordinary people.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
So he designed and went and started a village science program.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
Many people were inspired by this.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
The slogan of the early '70s

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
was "Go to the people.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
Live with them; love them.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
Start from what they know. Build on what they have."

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
This was kind of the defining slogan.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
Well I took one year.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
I joined Telco, made TATA trucks, pretty close to Pune.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
I worked there for two years,

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
and I realized that I was not born to make trucks.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
Often one doesn't know what one wants to do,

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
but it's good enough to know what you don't want to do.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
So I took one year off, and I went to this village science program.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
And it was a turning point.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
It was a very small village --

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
a weekly bazaar

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
where people, just once in a week, they put in all the vats.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
So I said, "I'm going to spend a year over here."

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
So I just bought one specimen

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
of everything which was sold on the roadside.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
And one thing which I found

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
was this black rubber.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
This is called a cycle valve tube.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
When you pump in air in a bicycle, you use a bit of this.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
And some of these models --

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
so you take a bit of this cycle valve tube,

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
you can put two matchsticks inside this, and you make a flexible joint.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
It's a joint of tubes. You start by teaching angles --

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
an acute angle, a right angle, an obtuse angle, a straight angle.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
It's like its own little coupling.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
If you have three of them, and you loop them together,

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
well you make a triangle.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
With four, you make a square,

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
you make a pentagon, you make a hexagon,

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
you make all these kind of polygons.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
And they have some wonderful properties.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
If you look at the hexagon, for instance,

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
it's like an amoeba, which is constantly changing its own profile.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
You can just pull this out, this becomes a rectangle.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
You give it a push, this becomes a parallelogram.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
But this is very shaky.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
Look at the pentagon, for instance,

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
pull this out -- it becomes a boat shape trapezium.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
Push it and it becomes house shaped.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
This becomes an isosceles triangle --

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
again, very shaky.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
This square might look very square and prim.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
Give it a little push -- this becomes a rhombus.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
It becomes kite-shaped.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
But give a child a triangle,

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
he can't do a thing to it.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
Why use triangles?

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000
Because triangles are the only rigid structures.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000
We can't make a bridge with squares

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000
because the train would come, it would start doing a jig.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
Ordinary people know about this

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000
because if you go to a village in India,

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
they might not have gone to engineering college,

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
but no one makes a roof placed like this.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000
Because if they put tiles on top, it's just going to crash.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
They always make a triangular roof.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000
Now this is people science.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000
And if you were to just poke a hole over here

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
and put a third matchstick,

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000
you'll get a T joint.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
And if I were to poke all the three legs of this

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000
in the three vertices of this triangle,

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000
I would make a tetrahedron.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000
So you make all these 3D shapes.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.000
You make a tetrahedron like this.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.000
And once you make these,

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000
you make a little house.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000
Put this on top.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000
You can make a joint of four. You can make a joint of six.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.000
You just need a ton.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000
Now this was -- you make a joint of six,

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
you make an icosahedron.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
You can play around with it.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000
This makes an igloo.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000
Now this is in 1978.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.000
I was a 24-year-old young engineer.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.000
And I thought this was so much better than making trucks.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:17.000
(Applause)

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.000
If you, as a matter of fact, put four marbles inside,

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.000
you simulate the molecular structure of methane, CH4.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.000
Four atoms of hydrogen, the four points of the tetrahedron,

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000
which means the little carbon atom.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000
Well since then,

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.000
I just thought that I've been really privileged

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.000
to go to over 2,000 schools in my country --

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000
village schools, government schools,

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000
municipal schools, Ivy League schools --

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000
I've been invited by most of them.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000
And every time I go to a school,

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000
I see a gleam in the eyes of the children.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.000
I see hope. I see happiness in their faces.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.000
Children want to make things. Children want to do things.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.000
Now this, we make lots and lots of pumps.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000
Now this is a little pump

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000
with which you could inflate a balloon.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.000
It's a real pump. You could actually pop the balloon.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000
And we have a slogan

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.000
that the best thing a child can do with a toy is to break it.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000
So all you do is --

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000
it's a very kind of provocative statement --

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000
this old bicycle tube and this old plastic [unclear]

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.000
This filling cap will go very snugly into an old bicycle tube.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000
And this is how you make a valve.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000
You put a little sticky tape.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.000
This is one-way traffic.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000
Well we make lots and lots of pumps.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000
And this is the other one --

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000
that you just take a straw, and you just put a stick inside

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.000
and you make two half-cuts.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000
Now this is what you do,

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.000
is you bend both these legs into a triangle,

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000
and you just wrap some tape around.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000
And this is the pump.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.000
And now, if you have this pump,

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.000
it's like a great, great sprinkler.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000
It's like a centrifuge.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.000
If you spin something, it tends to fly out.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.000
(Applause)

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000
Well in terms of -- if you were in Andhra Pradesh,

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.000
you would make this with the palmyra leaf.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000
Many of our folk toys

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.000
have great science principles.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000
If you spin-top something, it tends to fly out.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.000
If I do it with both hands, you can see this fun Mr. Flying Man.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000
Right.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.000
This is a toy which is made from paper. It's amazing.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.000
There are four pictures.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.000
You see insects,

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.000
you see frogs, snakes, eagles, butterflies,

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.000
frogs, snakes, eagles.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000
Here's a paper which you could [unclear] --

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000
designed by a mathematician at Harvard in 1928,

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000
Arthur Stone,

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:34.000
documented by Martin Gardner in many of his many books.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000
But this is great fun for children.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.000
They all study about the food chain.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.000
The insects are eaten by the frogs; the frogs are eaten by the snakes;

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000
the snakes are eaten by the eagles.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000
And this can be, if you had a whole photocopy paper --

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.000
A4 size paper --

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:49.000
you could be in a municipal school, you could be in a government school --

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:52.000
a paper, a scale and a pencil -- no glue, no scissors.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:55.000
In three minutes, you just fold this up.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.000
And what you could use it for is just limited by your imagination.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:01.000
If you take a smaller paper, you make a smaller flexagon.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:04.000
With a bigger one, you make a bigger one.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.000
Now this is a pencil with a few slots over here.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.000
And you put a little fan here.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.000
And this is a hundred-year-old toy.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.000
There have been six major research papers on this.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.000
There's some grooves over here, you can see.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.000
And if I take a reed -- if I rub this,

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.000
something very amazing happens.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.000
Six major research papers on this.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.000
As a matter of fact, Feynman, as a child, was very fascinated by this.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.000
He wrote a paper on this.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000
And you don't need the three billion-dollar Hadron Collider

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000
for doing this. (Laughter) (Applause)

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.000
This is there for every child,

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.000
and every child can enjoy this.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.000
If you want to put a colored disk,

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.000
well all these seven colors coalesce.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.000
And this is what Newton talked about 400 years back,

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.000
that white light's made of seven colors,

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.000
just by spinning this around.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:50.000
This is a straw.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:53.000
What we've done, we've just sealed both the ends with tape,

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.000
nipped the right corner and the bottom left corner,

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:58.000
so there's holes in the opposite corners, there's a little hole over here.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000
This is a kind of a blowing straw.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000
I just put this inside this.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:05.000
There's a hole here, and I shut this.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000
And this costs very little money to make --

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.000
great fun for children to do.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.000
What we do

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.000
is make a very simple electric motor.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:21.000
Now this is the simplest motor on Earth.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:25.000
The most expensive thing is the battery inside this.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:28.000
If you have a battery, it costs five cents to make it.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.000
This is an old bicycle tube,

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000
which gives you a broad rubber band, two safety pins.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.000
This is a permanent magnet.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:37.000
Whenever current flows through the coil, this becomes an electromagnet.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.000
It's the interaction of both these magnets

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.000
which makes this motor spin.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.000
We made 30,000.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:46.000
Teachers who have been teaching science for donkey years,

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:49.000
they just muck up the definition and they spit it out.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000
When teachers make it, children make it.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.000
You can see a gleam in their eye.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:56.000
They get a thrill

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.000
of what science is all about.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.000
And this science is not a rich man's game.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000
In a democratic country,

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:05.000
science must reach to our most oppressed,

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.000
to the most marginalized children.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:10.000
This program started with 16 schools

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:13.000
and spread to 1,500 government schools.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:17.000
Over 100,000 children learn science this way.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.000
And we're just trying to see possibilities.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.000
Look, this is the tetrapak --

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:24.000
awful materials from the point of view of the environment.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:27.000
There are six layers -- three layers of plastic, aluminum --

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.000
which are are sealed together.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.000
They are fused together, so you can't separate them.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.000
Now you can just make a little network like this

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.000
and fold them and stick them together

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.000
and make an icosahedron.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.000
So something which is trash,

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:42.000
which is choking all the seabirds,

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.000
you could just recycle this into a very, very joyous --

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:48.000
all the platonic solids can be made with things like this.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:51.000
This is a little straw,

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:55.000
and what you do is you just nip two corners here,

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:59.000
and this becomes like a baby crocodile's mouth.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.000
You put this in your mouth, and you blow.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.000
(Honk)

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:07.000
It's children's delight, a teacher's envy, as they say.

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.000
You're not able to see how the sound is produced,

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:12.000
because the thing which is vibrating goes inside my mouth.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:15.000
I'm going to keep this outside, to blow out. I'm going to suck in air.

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:17.000
(Honk)

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:20.000
So no one actually needs to muck up the production of sound

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.000
with wire vibrations.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.000
The other is that you keep blowing at it,

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.000
keep making the sound,

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.000
and you keep cutting it.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.000
And something very, very nice happens.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:42.000
(Honk)

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:45.000
(Applause)

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.000
And when you get a very small one --

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:50.000
(Honk)

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:53.000
This is what the kids teach you. You can also do this.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.000
Well before I go any further,

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.000
this is something worth sharing.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.000
This is a touching slate meant for blind children.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:02.000
This is strips of Velcro, this is my drawing slate,

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:04.000
and this is my drawing pen,

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:06.000
which is basically a film box.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:10.000
It's basically like a fisherman's line,

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.000
a fishing line.

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.000
And this is wool over here.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:17.000
If I crank the handle, all the wool goes inside.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:20.000
And what a blind child can do is to just draw this.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.000
Wool sticks on Velcro.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:28.000
There are 12 million blind children in our country --

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.000
(Applause)

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.000
who live in a world of darkness.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:35.000
And this has come as a great boon to them.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:38.000
There's a factory out there making our children blind,

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.000
not able to provide them with food,

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:42.000
not able to provide them with vitamin A.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:44.000
But this has come as a great boon for them.

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:47.000
There are no patents. Anyone can make it.

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.000
This is very, very simple.

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:53.000
You can see, this is the generator. It's a crank generator.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.000
These are two magnets.

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:58.000
This is a large pulley made by sandwiching rubber between two old CDs.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.000
Small pulley and two strong magnets.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:03.000
And this fiber turns a wire attached to an LED.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:05.000
If I spin this pulley, the small one's going to spin much faster.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:07.000
There will be a spinning magnetic field.

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:10.000
Lines, of course, would be cut, the force will be generated.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.000
And you can see, this LED is going to glow.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:15.000
So this is a small crank generator.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:19.000
Well, this is, again,

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:22.000
it's just a ring, a steel ring with steel nuts.

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:24.000
And what you can do

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:27.000
is just, if you give it a twirl,

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:30.000
well they just keep going on.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:35.000
And imagine a bunch of kids

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:37.000
standing in a circle

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.000
and just waiting for the steel ring to be passed on.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:43.000
And they'd be absolutely joyous playing with this.

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:46.000
Well in the end, what we can also do:

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:49.000
we use a lot of old newspapers

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:51.000
to make caps.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.000
This is worthy of Sachin Tendulkar.

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:56.000
It's a great cricket cap. (Laughter) (Applause)

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.000
When first you see Nehru and Gandhi,

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:01.000
this is the Nehru cap -- just half a newspaper.

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:03.000
We make lots of toys with newspapers,

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:05.000
and this is one of them.

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:07.000
And this is -- you can see --

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:10.000
this is a flapping bird.

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:13.000
All of our old newspapers, we cut them into little squares.

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:15.000
And if you have one of these birds --

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:19.000
children in Japan have been making this bird for many, many years.

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.000
And you can see,

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:25.000
this is a little fantail bird.

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:29.000
Well in the end, I'll just end with a story.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:31.000
This is called "The Captain's Hat Story."

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.000
The captain was a captain of a sea-going ship.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:35.000
It goes very slowly.

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:37.000
And there were lots of passengers on the ship,

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:39.000
and they were getting bored, so the captain invited them on the deck.

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:41.000
"Wear all your colorful clothes and sing and dance,

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:43.000
and I'll provide you with good food and drinks."

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:45.000
And the captain would wear a cap everyday

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.000
and join in the regalia.

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:49.000
The first day, it was a huge umbrella cap,

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:51.000
like a captain's cap.

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:54.000
That night, when the passengers would be sleeping,

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.000
he would give it one more fold,

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:58.000
and the second day, he would be wearing a fireman's cap --

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:00.000
with a little shoot just like a designer cap,

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:03.000
because it protects the spinal cord.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:05.000
And the second night, he would take the same cap

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:07.000
and give it another fold.

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:09.000
And the third day, it would be a Shikari cap --

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:12.000
just like an adventurer's cap.

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:15.000
And the third night, he would give it two more folds --

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:17.000
and this is a very, very famous cap.

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:19.000
If you've seen any of our Bollywood films,

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:21.000
this is what the policeman wears,

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:23.000
it's called a zapalu cap.

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:26.000
It's been catapulted to international glory.

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:29.000
And we must not forget that he was the captain of the ship.

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:31.000
So that's a ship.

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:33.000
And now the end:

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:35.000
everyone was enjoying the journey very much.

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:37.000
They were singing and dancing.

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:40.000
Suddenly there was a storm and huge waves.

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:43.000
And all the ship can do is to dance and pitch along with the waves.

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:45.000
A huge wave comes and slaps the front

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:47.000
and knocks it down.

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:50.000
And another one comes and slaps the aft and knocks it down.

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:52.000
And there's a third one over here.

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:54.000
This swallows the bridge and knocks it down.

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:56.000
And the ship sinks,

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:58.000
and the captain has lost everything,

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:01.000
but for a life jacket.

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.000
Thank you so much.

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:09.000
(Applause)
