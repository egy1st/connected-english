00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Phyllis Rodriguez: We are here today

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
because of the fact

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
that we have what most people consider

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
an unusual friendship.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
And it is.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
And yet, it feels natural to us now.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
I first learned

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
that my son had been in the World Trade Center

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
on the morning of September 11th, 2001.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
We didn't know

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
if he had perished yet

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
until 36 hours later.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
At the time,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
we knew that it was political.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
We were afraid of what our country was going to do

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
in the name of our son --

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
my husband, Orlando, and I and our family.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
And when I saw it --

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
and yet, through the shock,

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
the terrible shock,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:58.000
and the terrible explosion in our lives, literally,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
we were not vengeful.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
And a couple of weeks later

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
when Zacarias Moussaoui was indicted

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.000
on six counts of conspiracy to commit terrorism,

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
and the U.S. government called for a death penalty

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
for him, if convicted,

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
my husband and I spoke out

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
in opposition to that, publicly.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
Through that

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
and through human rights groups,

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
we were brought together

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
with several other victims' families.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
When I saw Aicha in the media,

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
coming over when her son was indicted,

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
and I thought, "What a brave woman.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
Someday I want to meet that woman when I'm stronger."

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
I was still in deep grief;

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
I knew I didn't have the strength.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
I knew I would find her someday,

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
or we would find each other.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.000
Because, when people heard that my son was a victim,

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
I got immediate sympathy.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
But when people learned

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
what her son was accused of,

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
she didn't get that sympathy.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
But her suffering is equal to mine.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
So we met in November 2002,

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
and Aicha will now tell you

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000
how that came about.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.000
(Translator) Aicha el-Wafi: Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.000
I am the mother of Zacarias Moussaoui.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:38.000
And I asked

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000
the Organization of Human Rights

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:45.000
to put me in touch with the parents of the victims.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
So they introduced me

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
to five families.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.000
And I saw Phyllis, and I watched her.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000
She was the only mother in the group.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.000
The others were brothers, sisters.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
And I saw in her eyes

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000
that she was a mother, just like me.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000
I suffered a lot as a mother.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.000
I was married when I was 14.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.000
I lost a child when I was 15,

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000
a second child when I was 16.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.000
So the story with Zacarias was too much really.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.000
And I still suffer,

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000
because my son

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
is like he's buried alive.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:04.000
I know she really cried for her son.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.000
But she knows where he is.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000
My son, I don't know where he is.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000
I don't know if he's alive. I don't know if he's tortured.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000
I don't know what happened to him.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.000
So that's why I decided to tell my story,

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.000
so that my suffering is something positive for other women.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:37.000
For all the women, all the mothers that give life,

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000
you can give back,

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000
you can change.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.000
It's up to us women,

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.000
because we are women,

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
because we love our children.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000
We must be hand-in-hand

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000
and do something together.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000
It's not against women,

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000
it's for us, for us women,

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000
for our children.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.000
I talk against violence, against terrorism.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000
I go to schools

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.000
to talk to young, Muslim girls

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:31.000
so they don't accept to be married against their will very young.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:48.000
So if I can save one of the young girls,

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.000
and avoid that they get married and suffer as much as I did,

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000
well this is something good.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000
This is why I'm here in front of you.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.000
PR: I would like to say

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.000
that I have learned so much from Aicha,

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.000
starting with that day we had our very first meeting

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000
with other family members --

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.000
which was a very private meeting with security,

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.000
because it was November 2002,

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:19.000
and, frankly, we were afraid of the super-patriotism of that time in the country --

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:23.000
those of us family members.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.000
But we were all so nervous.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.000
"Why does she want to meet us?"

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000
And then she was nervous.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.000
"Why did we want to meet her?"

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.000
What did we want from each other?

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:40.000
Before we knew each others' names, or anything,

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000
we had embraced and wept.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.000
Then we sat in a circle

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000
with support, with help,

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:51.000
from people experienced in this kind of reconciliation.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000
And Aicha started,

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000
and she said,

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.000
"I don't know if my son

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000
is guilty or innocent,

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.000
but I want to tell you how sorry I am

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:08.000
for what happened to your families.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:11.000
I know what it is to suffer,

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:15.000
and I feel that if there is a crime,

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:19.000
a person should be tried fairly and punished."

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:24.000
But she reached out to us in that way,

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:28.000
and it was, I'd like to say, it was an ice-breaker.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:32.000
And what happened then is we all told our stories,

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.000
and we all connected as human beings.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000
By the end of the afternoon --

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:40.000
it was about three hours after lunch --

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.000
we'd felt as if we'd known each other forever.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.000
Now what I learned from her,

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:47.000
is a woman, not only who could be so generous

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.000
under these present circumstances

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.000
and what it was then,

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.000
and what was being done to her son,

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.000
but the life she's had.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.000
I never had met

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.000
someone with such a hard life,

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:04.000
from such a totally different culture and environment from my own.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.000
And I feel

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.000
that we have

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.000
a special connection,

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000
which I value very much.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.000
And I think it's all about

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.000
being afraid of the other,

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:20.000
but making that step

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:23.000
and then realizing, "Hey, this wasn't so hard.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.000
Who else can I meet that I don't know,

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:28.000
or that I'm so different from?"

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000
So, Aicha,

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.000
do you have a couple of words

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.000
for conclusion?

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.000
Because our time is up.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:40.000
(Laughter)

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.000
(Translator) AW: I wanted to say

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:50.000
that we have to try to know other people, the other.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.000
You have to be generous,

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.000
and your hearts must be generous,

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:00.000
your mind must be generous.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000
You must be tolerant.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.000
You have to fight against violence.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:14.000
And I hope that someday we'll all live together

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:17.000
in peace and respecting each other.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.000
This is what I wanted to say.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:32.000
(Applause)
