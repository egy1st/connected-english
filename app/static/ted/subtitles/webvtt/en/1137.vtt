WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Good afternoon, everybody.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
I've got something to show you.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
(Laughter)

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Think about this as a pixel, a flying pixel.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
This is what we call, in our lab, sensible design.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Let me tell you a bit about it.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
Now if you take this picture -- I'm Italian originally,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
and every boy in Italy grows up

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
with this picture on the wall of his bedroom --

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
but the reason I'm showing you this

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
is that something very interesting

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
happened in Formula 1 racing

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
over the past couple of decades.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Now some time ago,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
if you wanted to win a Formula 1 race,

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
you take a budget, and you bet your budget

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
on a good driver and a good car.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
And if the car and the driver were good enough, then you'd win the race.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
Now today, if you want to win the race,

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
actually you need also something like this --

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
something that monitors the car in real time,

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
has a few thousand sensors

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
collecting information from the car,

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
transmitting this information into the system,

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
and then processing it

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
and using it in order to go back to the car with decisions

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
and changing things in real time

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
as information is collected.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
This is what, in engineering terms,

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
you would call a real time control system.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
And basically, it's a system made of two components --

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
a sensing and an actuating component.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
What is interesting today

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
is that real time control systems

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
are starting to enter into our lives.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
Our cities, over the past few years,

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
just have been blanketed

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
with networks, electronics.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
They're becoming like computers in open air.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
And, as computers in open air,

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
they're starting to respond in a different way

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
to be able to be sensed and to be actuated.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
If we fix cities, actually it's a big deal.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
Just as an aside, I wanted to mention,

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000
cities are only two percent of the Earth's crust,

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
but they are 50 percent of the world's population.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
They are 75 percent of the energy consumption --

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
up to 80 percent of CO2 emissions.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000
So if we're able to do something with cities, that's a big deal.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
Beyond cities,

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
all of this sensing and actuating

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
is entering our everyday objects.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
That's from an exhibition that

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
Paola Antonelli is organizing

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
at MoMA later this year, during the summer.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
It's called "Talk to Me."

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
Well our objects, our environment

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
is starting to talk back to us.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000
In a certain sense, it's almost as if every atom out there

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000
were becoming both a sensor and an actuator.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000
And that is radically changing the interaction we have as humans

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
with the environment out there.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
In a certain sense,

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
it's almost as if the old dream of Michelangelo ...

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
you know, when Michelangelo sculpted the Moses,

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000
at the end it said that he took the hammer, threw it at the Moses --

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000
actually you can still see a small chip underneath --

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
and said, shouted,

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000
"PerchÃ© non parli? Why don't you talk?"

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000
Well today, for the first time,

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000
our environment is starting to talk back to us.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
And I'll show just a few examples --

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000
again, with this idea of sensing our environment and actuating it.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000
Let's starting with sensing.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000
Well, the first project I wanted to share with you

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000
is actually one of the first projects by our lab.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000
It was four and a half years ago in Italy.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
And what we did there

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
was actually use a new type of network at the time

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
that had been deployed all across the world --

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
that's a cellphone network --

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000
and use anonymous and aggregated information from that network,

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000
that's collected anyway by the operator,

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000
in order to understand

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000
how the city works.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.000
The summer was a lucky summer -- 2006.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.000
It's when Italy won the soccer World Cup.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.000
Some of you might remember, it was Italy and France playing,

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000
and then Zidane at the end, the headbutt.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000
And anyway, Italy won at the end.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000
(Laughter)

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000
Now look at what happened that day

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
just by monitoring activity

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
happening on the network.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000
Here you see the city.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000
You see the Colosseum in the middle,

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000
the river Tiber.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000
It's morning, before the match.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000
You see the timeline on the top.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000
Early afternoon,

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000
people here and there,

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000
making calls and moving.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.000
The match begins -- silence.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.000
France scores. Italy scores.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:29.000
Halftime, people make a quick call and go to the bathroom.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000
Second half. End of normal time.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000
First overtime, second.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000
Zidane, the headbutt in a moment.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000
Italy wins. Yeah.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000
(Laughter)

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.000
(Applause)

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000
Well, that night, everybody went to celebrate in the center.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000
You saw the big peak.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000
The following day, again everybody went to the center

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.000
to meet the winning team

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000
and the prime minister at the time.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000
And then everybody moved down.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000
You see the image of the place called Circo Massimo,

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.000
where, since Roman times, people go to celebrate,

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.000
to have a big party, and you see the peak at the end of the day.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000
Well, that's just one example of how we can sense the city today

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000
in a way that we couldn't have done

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000
just a few years ago.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000
Another quick example about sensing:

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000
it's not about people,

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000
but about things we use and consume.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000
Well today, we know everything

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.000
about where our objects come from.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000
This is a map that shows you

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.000
all the chips that form a Mac computer, how they came together.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.000
But we know very little about where things go.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000
So in this project,

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.000
we actually developed some small tags

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.000
to track trash as it moves through the system.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.000
So we actually started with a number of volunteers

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000
who helped us in Seattle,

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000
just over a year ago,

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.000
to tag what they were throwing away --

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.000
different types of things, as you can see here --

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000
things they would throw away anyway.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000
Then we put a little chip, little tag,

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.000
onto the trash

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000
and then started following it.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.000
Here are the results we just obtained.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000
(Music)

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.000
From Seattle ...

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.000
after one week.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.000
With this information we realized

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000
there's a lot of inefficiencies in the system.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.000
We can actually do the same thing with much less energy.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000
This data was not available before.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.000
But there's a lot of wasted transportation and convoluted things happening.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.000
But the other thing is that we believe

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000
that if we see every day

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000
that the cup we're throwing away, it doesn't disappear,

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.000
it's still somewhere on the planet.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:01.000
And the plastic bottle we're throwing away every day still stays there.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.000
And if we show that to people,

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.000
then we can also promote some behavioral change.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.000
So that was the reason for the project.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000
My colleague at MIT, Assaf Biderman,

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000
he could tell you much more about sensing

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.000
and many other wonderful things we can do with sensing,

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:16.000
but I wanted to go to the second part we discussed at the beginning,

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.000
and that's actuating our environment.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.000
And the first project

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:23.000
is something we did a couple of years ago in Zaragoza, Spain.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:26.000
It started with a question by the mayor of the city,

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.000
who came to us saying

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:31.000
that Spain and Southern Europe have a beautiful tradition

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:34.000
of using water in public space, in architecture.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000
And the question was: How could technology, new technology,

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.000
be added to that?

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:41.000
And one of the ideas that was developed at MIT in a workshop

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:44.000
was, imagine this pipe, and you've got valves,

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.000
solenoid valves, taps,

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.000
opening and closing.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:51.000
You create like a water curtain with pixels made of water.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.000
If those pixels fall,

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.000
you can write on it,

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.000
you can show patterns, images, text.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.000
And even you can approach it, and it will open up

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.000
to let you jump through,

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.000
as you see in this image.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.000
Well, we presented this to Mayor Belloch.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.000
He liked it very much.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.000
And we got a commission to design a building

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.000
at the entrance of the expo.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.000
We called it Digital Water Pavilion.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:16.000
The whole building is made of water.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.000
There's no doors or windows,

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.000
but when you approach it,

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.000
it will open up to let you in.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:30.000
(Music)

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:40.000
The roof also is covered with water.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.000
And if there's a bit of wind,

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:47.000
if you want to minimize splashing, you can actually lower the roof.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000
Or you could close the building,

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.000
and the whole architecture will disappear,

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.000
like in this case.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.000
You know, these days, you always get images during the winter,

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.000
when they take the roof down,

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:02.000
of people who have been there and said, "They demolished the building."

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000
No, they didn't demolish it, just when it goes down,

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.000
the architecture almost disappears.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:09.000
Here's the building working.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.000
You see the person puzzled about what was going on inside.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.000
And here was myself trying not to get wet,

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:17.000
testing the sensors that open the water.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.000
Well, I should tell you now what happened one night

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:22.000
when all of the sensors stopped working.

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:25.000
But actually that night, it was even more fun.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.000
All the kids from Zaragoza came to the building,

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:30.000
because the way of engaging with the building became something different.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:33.000
Not anymore a building that would open up to let you in,

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:36.000
but a building that would still make cuts and holes through the water,

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.000
and you had to jump without getting wet.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:51.000
(Video) (Crowd Noise)

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.000
And that was, for us, was very interesting,

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:56.000
because, as architects, as engineers, as designers,

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:59.000
we always think about how people will use the things we design.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:02.000
But then reality's always unpredictable.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.000
And that's the beauty of doing things

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.000
that are used and interact with people.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.000
Here is an image then of the building

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.000
with the physical pixels, the pixels made of water,

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:13.000
and then projections on them.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.000
And this is what led us to think about

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:17.000
the following project I'll show you now.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:20.000
That's, imagine those pixels could actually start flying.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.000
Imagine you could have small helicopters

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.000
that move in the air,

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:27.000
and then each of them with a small pixel in changing lights --

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:30.000
almost as a cloud that can move in space.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.000
Here is the video.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:38.000
(Music)

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:41.000
So imagine one helicopter,

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:44.000
like the one we saw before,

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:49.000
moving with others,

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.000
in synchrony.

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:54.000
So you can have this cloud.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:04.000
You can have a kind of flexible screen or display, like this --

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:07.000
a regular configuration in two dimensions.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:17.000
Or in regular, but in three dimensions,

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.000
where the thing that changes is the light,

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.000
not the pixels' position.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:33.000
You can play with a different type.

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.000
Imagine your screen could just appear

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:38.000
in different scales or sizes,

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:41.000
different types of resolution.

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.000
But then the whole thing can be

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.000
just a 3D cloud of pixels

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:57.000
that you can approach and move through it

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:00.000
and see from many, many directions.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.000
Here is the real Flyfire

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:06.000
control and going down to form the regular grid as before.

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:09.000
When you turn on the light, actually you see this. So the same as we saw before.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:11.000
And imagine each of them then controlled by people.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.000
You can have each pixel

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:15.000
having an input that comes from people,

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:17.000
from people's movement, or so and so.

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:20.000
I want to show you something here for the first time.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.000
We've been working with Roberto Bolle,

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:24.000
one of today's top ballet dancers --

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:26.000
the Ã©toile at Metropolitan in New York

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.000
and La Scala in Milan --

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.000
and actually captured his movement in 3D

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:33.000
in order to use it as an input for Flyfire.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:36.000
And here you can see Roberto dancing.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.000
You see on the left the pixels,

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:42.000
the different resolutions being captured.

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:44.000
It's both 3D scanning in real time

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:47.000
and motion capture.

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:51.000
So you can reconstruct a whole movement.

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:58.000
You can go all the way through.

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:03.000
But then, once we have the pixels, then you can play with them

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:06.000
and play with color and movement

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:09.000
and gravity and rotation.

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:11.000
So we want to use this as one of the possible inputs

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:13.000
for Flyfire.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.000
I wanted to show you the last project we are working on.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:36.000
It's something we're working on for the London Olympics.

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.000
It's called The Cloud.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.000
And the idea here is, imagine, again,

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:42.000
we can involve people

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:45.000
in doing something and changing our environment --

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.000
almost to impart what we call cloud raising --

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:49.000
like barn raising, but with a cloud.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:53.000
Imagine you can have everybody make a small donation for one pixel.

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.000
And I think what is remarkable

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.000
that has happened over the past couple of years

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:59.000
is that, over the past couple of decades,

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:02.000
we went from the physical world to the digital one.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.000
This has been digitizing everything, knowledge,

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:06.000
and making that accessible through the Internet.

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:08.000
Now today, for the first time --

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:10.000
and the Obama campaign showed us this --

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:12.000
we can go from the digital world,

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:14.000
from the self-organizing power of networks,

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.000
to the physical one.

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.000
This can be, in our case,

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:20.000
we want to use it for designing and doing a symbol.

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:22.000
That means something built in a city.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:24.000
But tomorrow it can be,

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:27.000
in order to tackle today's pressing challenges --

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:29.000
think about climate change or CO2 emissions --

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:32.000
how we can go from the digital world to the physical one.

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.000
So the idea that we can actually involve people

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:36.000
in doing this thing together, collectively.

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:39.000
The cloud is a cloud, again, made of pixels,

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:41.000
in the same way as the real cloud

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:43.000
is a cloud made of particles.

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:45.000
And those particles are water,

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:47.000
where our cloud is a cloud of pixels.

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:50.000
It's a physical structure in London, but covered with pixels.

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:52.000
You can move inside, have different types of experiences.

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:54.000
You can actually see from underneath,

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:56.000
sharing the main moments

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:59.000
for the Olympics in 2012 and beyond,

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:03.000
and really using it as a way to connect with the community.

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:07.000
So both the physical cloud in the sky

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:10.000
and something you can go to the top [of],

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:12.000
like London's new mountaintop.

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:14.000
You can enter inside it.

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:17.000
And a kind of new digital beacon for the night --

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:19.000
but most importantly,

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:22.000
a new type of experience for anybody who will go to the top.

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:24.000
Thank you.

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:26.000
(Applause)
