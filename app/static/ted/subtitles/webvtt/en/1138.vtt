00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
So as a fashion designer,

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
I've always tended to think of materials

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
something like this,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
or this,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
or maybe this.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
But then I met a biologist,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
and now I think of materials like this --

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
green tea, sugar,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
a few microbes and a little time.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
I'm essentially using a kombucha recipe,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
which is a symbiotic mix

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
of bacteria, yeasts and other micro-organisms,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
which spin cellulose

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
in a fermentation process.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
Over time, these tiny threads

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
form in the liquid into layers

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
and produce a mat on the surface.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
So we start by brewing the tea.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
I brew up to about 30 liters of tea at a time,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
and then while it's still hot, add a couple of kilos of sugar.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
We stir this in until it's completely dissolved

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
and then pour it into a growth bath.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
We need to check that the temperature

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
has cooled to below 30 degrees C.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
And then we're ready to add the living organism.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
And along with that, some acetic acid.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
And once you get this process going,

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
you can actually recycle

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
your previous fermented liquid.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
We need to maintain an optimum temperature for the growth.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
And I use a heat mat to sit the bath on

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
and a thermostat to regulate it.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
And actually, in hot weather, I can just grow it outside.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
So this is my mini fabric farm.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
After about three days,

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
the bubbles will appear on the surface of the liquid.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
So this is telling us that the fermentation is in full swing.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
And the bacteria are feeding

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
on the sugar nutrients in the liquid.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
So they're spinning these tiny nano fibers

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
of pure cellulose.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
And they're sticking together, forming layers

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
and giving us a sheet on the surface.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
After about two to three weeks,

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
we're looking at something which is about an inch in thickness.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
So the bath on the left is after five days,

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
and on the right, after 10.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
And this is a static culture.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
You don't have to do anything to it;

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
you just literally watch it grow.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
It doesn't need light.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
And when it's ready to harvest, you take it out of the bath

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
and you wash it in cold, soapy water.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
At this point, it's really heavy.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
It's over 90 percent water,

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
so we need to let that evaporate.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
So I spread it out onto a wooden sheet.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
Again, you can do that outside

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
and just let it dry in the air.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
And as it's drying, it's compressing,

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
so what you're left with, depending on the recipe,

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
is something that's either

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
like a really light-weight, transparent paper,

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.000
or something which is much more like a flexible vegetable leather.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
And then you can either cut that out

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
and sew it conventionally,

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
or you can use the wet material

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
to form it around a three-dimensional shape.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
And as it evaporates,

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
it will knit itself together, forming seams.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000
So the color in this jacket is coming purely from green tea.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
I guess it also looks a little bit like human skin,

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
which intrigues me.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
Since it's organic,

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000
I'm really keen to try and minimize the addition of any chemicals.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000
I can make it change color without using dye

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
by a process of iron oxidation.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
Using fruit and vegetable staining,

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
create organic patterning.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
And using indigo,

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000
make it anti-microbial.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
And in fact, cotton

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000
would take up to 18 dips in indigo

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
to achieve a color this dark.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000
And because of the super-absorbency of this kind of cellulose,

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.000
it just takes one, and a really short one at that.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.000
What I can't yet do is make it water-resistant.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.000
So if I was to walk outside in the rain

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000
wearing this dress today,

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000
I would immediately start to absorb

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000
huge amounts of water.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000
The dress would get really heavy,

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000
and eventually the seams would probably fall apart --

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000
leaving me feeling rather naked.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000
Possibly a good performance piece,

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.000
but definitely not ideal for everyday wear.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000
What I'm looking for

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000
is a way to give the material

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000
the qualities that I need.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.000
So what I want to do is say to a future bug,

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
"Spin me a thread.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000
Align it in this direction.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000
Make it hydrophobic.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000
And while you're at it,

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.000
just form it around this 3D shape."

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.000
Bacterial cellulose is actually already being used for wound healing,

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000
and possibly in the future

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.000
for biocompatible blood vessels,

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000
possibly even replacement bone tissue.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000
But with synthetic biology,

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:27.000
we can actually imagine engineering this bacterium

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000
to produce something

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000
that gives us the quality,

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000
quantity and shape

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000
of material that we desire.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.000
Obviously, as a designer, that's really exciting

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000
because then I start to think, wow,

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000
we could actually imagine

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.000
growing consumable products.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.000
What excites me about using microbes

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000
is their efficiency.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000
So we only grow what we need.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000
There's no waste.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.000
And in fact, we could make it from a waste stream --

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000
so for example,

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000
a waste sugar stream

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000
from a food processing plant.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.000
Finally, at the end of use, we could biodegrade it naturally

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.000
along with your vegetable peelings.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.000
What I'm not suggesting is that microbial cellulose

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000
is going to be a replacement

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000
for cotton, leather or other textile materials.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:22.000
But I do think it could be quite a smart and sustainable addition

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.000
to our increasingly precious natural resources.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000
Ultimately, maybe it won't even be fashion

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000
where we see these microbes have their impact.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000
We could, for example, imagine

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.000
growing a lamp, a chair,

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.000
a car or maybe even a house.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.000
So I guess what my question to you is:

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000
in the future, what would you choose to grow?

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.000
Thank you very much.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:53.000
(Applause)

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.000
Bruno Giussani: Suzanne, just a curiosity,

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.000
what you're wearing is not random. (Suzanne Lee: No.)

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000
This is one of the jackets you grew?

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000
SL: Yes, it is.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.000
It's probably -- part of the project's still in process

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.000
because this one

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000
is actually biodegrading in front of your eyes.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000
(Laughter)

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.000
It's absorbing my sweat, and it's feeding on it.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000
BG: Okay, so we'll let you go and save it, and rescue it.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.000
Suzanne Lee. (SL: Thank you.)

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000
(Applause)
