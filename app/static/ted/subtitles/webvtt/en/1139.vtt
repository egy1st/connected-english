00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
The universe

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
is really big.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
We live in a galaxy, the Milky Way Galaxy.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
There are about a hundred billion stars in the Milky Way Galaxy.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
And if you take a camera

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
and you point it at a random part of the sky,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
and you just keep the shutter open,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
as long as your camera is attached to the Hubble Space Telescope,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
it will see something like this.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Every one of these little blobs

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
is a galaxy roughly the size of our Milky Way --

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
a hundred billion stars in each of those blobs.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
There are approximately a hundred billion galaxies

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
in the observable universe.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
100 billion is the only number you need to know.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
The age of the universe, between now and the Big Bang,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
is a hundred billion in dog years.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
(Laughter)

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
Which tells you something about our place in the universe.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
One thing you can do with a picture like this is simply admire it.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
It's extremely beautiful.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
I've often wondered, what is the evolutionary pressure

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
that made our ancestors in the Veldt adapt and evolve

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
to really enjoy pictures of galaxies

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
when they didn't have any.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
But we would also like to understand it.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.000
As a cosmologist, I want to ask, why is the universe like this?

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
One big clue we have is that the universe is changing with time.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
If you looked at one of these galaxies and measured its velocity,

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
it would be moving away from you.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
And if you look at a galaxy even farther away,

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
it would be moving away faster.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
So we say the universe is expanding.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
What that means, of course, is that, in the past,

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
things were closer together.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
In the past, the universe was more dense,

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
and it was also hotter.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
If you squeeze things together, the temperature goes up.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
That kind of makes sense to us.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
The thing that doesn't make sense to us as much

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
is that the universe, at early times, near the Big Bang,

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
was also very, very smooth.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
You might think that that's not a surprise.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
The air in this room is very smooth.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
You might say, "Well, maybe things just smoothed themselves out."

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
But the conditions near the Big Bang are very, very different

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
than the conditions of the air in this room.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
In particular, things were a lot denser.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
The gravitational pull of things

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
was a lot stronger near the Big Bang.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
What you have to think about

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
is we have a universe with a hundred billion galaxies,

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
a hundred billion stars each.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
At early times, those hundred billion galaxies

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
were squeezed into a region about this big --

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
literally -- at early times.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
And you have to imagine doing that squeezing

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
without any imperfections,

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
without any little spots

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
where there were a few more atoms than somewhere else.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000
Because if there had been, they would have collapsed under the gravitational pull

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
into a huge black hole.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
Keeping the universe very, very smooth at early times

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
is not easy; it's a delicate arrangement.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
It's a clue

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
that the early universe is not chosen randomly.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
There is something that made it that way.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
We would like to know what.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000
So part of our understanding of this was given to us by Ludwig Boltzmann,

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000
an Austrian physicist in the 19th century.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000
And Boltzmann's contribution was that he helped us understand entropy.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
You've heard of entropy.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
It's the randomness, the disorder, the chaoticness of some systems.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
Boltzmann gave us a formula --

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
engraved on his tombstone now --

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
that really quantifies what entropy is.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
And it's basically just saying

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
that entropy is the number of ways

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000
we can rearrange the constituents of a system so that you don't notice,

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
so that macroscopically it looks the same.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
If you have the air in this room,

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000
you don't notice each individual atom.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000
A low entropy configuration

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
is one in which there's only a few arrangements that look that way.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
A high entropy arrangement

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
is one that there are many arrangements that look that way.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
This is a crucially important insight

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000
because it helps us explain

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000
the second law of thermodynamics --

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.000
the law that says that entropy increases in the universe,

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
or in some isolated bit of the universe.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
The reason why entropy increases

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000
is simply because there are many more ways

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000
to be high entropy than to be low entropy.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000
That's a wonderful insight,

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000
but it leaves something out.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000
This insight that entropy increases, by the way,

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.000
is what's behind what we call the arrow of time,

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000
the difference between the past and the future.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000
Every difference that there is

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000
between the past and the future

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000
is because entropy is increasing --

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
the fact that you can remember the past, but not the future.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
The fact that you are born, and then you live, and then you die,

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
always in that order,

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000
that's because entropy is increasing.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000
Boltzmann explained that if you start with low entropy,

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000
it's very natural for it to increase

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.000
because there's more ways to be high entropy.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000
What he didn't explain

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.000
was why the entropy was ever low in the first place.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000
The fact that the entropy of the universe was low

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000
was a reflection of the fact

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000
that the early universe was very, very smooth.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000
We'd like to understand that.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000
That's our job as cosmologists.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
Unfortunately, it's actually not a problem

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
that we've been giving enough attention to.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
It's not one of the first things people would say,

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000
if you asked a modern cosmologist,

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000
"What are the problems we're trying to address?"

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000
One of the people who did understand that this was a problem

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000
was Richard Feynman.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000
50 years ago, he gave a series of a bunch of different lectures.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000
He gave the popular lectures

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000
that became "The Character of Physical Law."

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000
He gave lectures to Caltech undergrads

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000
that became "The Feynman Lectures on Physics."

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
He gave lectures to Caltech graduate students

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000
that became "The Feynman Lectures on Gravitation."

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000
In every one of these books, every one of these sets of lectures,

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000
he emphasized this puzzle:

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.000
Why did the early universe have such a small entropy?

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000
So he says -- I'm not going to do the accent --

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.000
he says, "For some reason, the universe, at one time,

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.000
had a very low entropy for its energy content,

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000
and since then the entropy has increased.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.000
The arrow of time cannot be completely understood

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000
until the mystery of the beginnings of the history of the universe

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000
are reduced still further

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000
from speculation to understanding."

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000
So that's our job.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000
We want to know -- this is 50 years ago, "Surely," you're thinking,

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000
"we've figured it out by now."

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000
It's not true that we've figured it out by now.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000
The reason the problem has gotten worse,

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.000
rather than better,

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000
is because in 1998

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.000
we learned something crucial about the universe that we didn't know before.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000
We learned that it's accelerating.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000
The universe is not only expanding.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000
If you look at the galaxy, it's moving away.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000
If you come back a billion years later and look at it again,

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.000
it will be moving away faster.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.000
Individual galaxies are speeding away from us faster and faster

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.000
so we say the universe is accelerating.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000
Unlike the low entropy of the early universe,

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.000
even though we don't know the answer for this,

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000
we at least have a good theory that can explain it,

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.000
if that theory is right,

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000
and that's the theory of dark energy.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.000
It's just the idea that empty space itself has energy.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.000
In every little cubic centimeter of space,

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.000
whether or not there's stuff,

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000
whether or not there's particles, matter, radiation or whatever,

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.000
there's still energy, even in the space itself.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000
And this energy, according to Einstein,

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.000
exerts a push on the universe.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.000
It is a perpetual impulse

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000
that pushes galaxies apart from each other.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.000
Because dark energy, unlike matter or radiation,

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.000
does not dilute away as the universe expands.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.000
The amount of energy in each cubic centimeter

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.000
remains the same,

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000
even as the universe gets bigger and bigger.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.000
This has crucial implications

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.000
for what the universe is going to do in the future.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000
For one thing, the universe will expand forever.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000
Back when I was your age,

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000
we didn't know what the universe was going to do.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.000
Some people thought that the universe would recollapse in the future.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000
Einstein was fond of this idea.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.000
But if there's dark energy, and the dark energy does not go away,

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.000
the universe is just going to keep expanding forever and ever and ever.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000
14 billion years in the past,

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.000
100 billion dog years,

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.000
but an infinite number of years into the future.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.000
Meanwhile, for all intents and purposes,

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.000
space looks finite to us.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.000
Space may be finite or infinite,

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.000
but because the universe is accelerating,

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.000
there are parts of it we cannot see

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.000
and never will see.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.000
There's a finite region of space that we have access to,

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.000
surrounded by a horizon.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.000
So even though time goes on forever,

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000
space is limited to us.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.000
Finally, empty space has a temperature.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.000
In the 1970s, Stephen Hawking told us

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.000
that a black hole, even though you think it's black,

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.000
it actually emits radiation

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.000
when you take into account quantum mechanics.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:44.000
The curvature of space-time around the black hole

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:47.000
brings to life the quantum mechanical fluctuation,

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.000
and the black hole radiates.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:52.000
A precisely similar calculation by Hawking and Gary Gibbons

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:55.000
showed that if you have dark energy in empty space,

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:58.000
then the whole universe radiates.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000
The energy of empty space

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000
brings to life quantum fluctuations.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000
And so even though the universe will last forever,

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:07.000
and ordinary matter and radiation will dilute away,

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.000
there will always be some radiation,

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.000
some thermal fluctuations,

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.000
even in empty space.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.000
So what this means

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.000
is that the universe is like a box of gas

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.000
that lasts forever.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.000
Well what is the implication of that?

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:24.000
That implication was studied by Boltzmann back in the 19th century.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.000
He said, well, entropy increases

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.000
because there are many, many more ways

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:32.000
for the universe to be high entropy, rather than low entropy.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:35.000
But that's a probabilistic statement.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.000
It will probably increase,

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.000
and the probability is enormously huge.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.000
It's not something you have to worry about --

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:45.000
the air in this room all gathering over one part of the room and suffocating us.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.000
It's very, very unlikely.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.000
Except if they locked the doors

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000
and kept us here literally forever,

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.000
that would happen.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.000
Everything that is allowed,

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:58.000
every configuration that is allowed to be obtained by the molecules in this room,

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.000
would eventually be obtained.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.000
So Boltzmann says, look, you could start with a universe

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.000
that was in thermal equilibrium.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:08.000
He didn't know about the Big Bang. He didn't know about the expansion of the universe.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:11.000
He thought that space and time were explained by Isaac Newton --

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.000
they were absolute; they just stuck there forever.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.000
So his idea of a natural universe

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:18.000
was one in which the air molecules were just spread out evenly everywhere --

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.000
the everything molecules.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:23.000
But if you're Boltzmann, you know that if you wait long enough,

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:26.000
the random fluctuations of those molecules

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.000
will occasionally bring them

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.000
into lower entropy configurations.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.000
And then, of course, in the natural course of things,

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.000
they will expand back.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.000
So it's not that entropy must always increase --

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.000
you can get fluctuations into lower entropy,

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.000
more organized situations.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.000
Well if that's true,

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.000
Boltzmann then goes onto invent

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.000
two very modern-sounding ideas --

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:50.000
the multiverse and the anthropic principle.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.000
He says, the problem with thermal equilibrium

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.000
is that we can't live there.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:57.000
Remember, life itself depends on the arrow of time.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.000
We would not be able to process information,

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.000
metabolize, walk and talk,

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.000
if we lived in thermal equilibrium.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.000
So if you imagine a very, very big universe,

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.000
an infinitely big universe,

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.000
with randomly bumping into each other particles,

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:12.000
there will occasionally be small fluctuations in the lower entropy states,

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.000
and then they relax back.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.000
But there will also be large fluctuations.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.000
Occasionally, you will make a planet

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.000
or a star or a galaxy

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.000
or a hundred billion galaxies.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.000
So Boltzmann says,

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:27.000
we will only live in the part of the multiverse,

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:30.000
in the part of this infinitely big set of fluctuating particles,

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.000
where life is possible.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.000
That's the region where entropy is low.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:37.000
Maybe our universe is just one of those things

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.000
that happens from time to time.

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.000
Now your homework assignment

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.000
is to really think about this, to contemplate what it means.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.000
Carl Sagan once famously said

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.000
that "in order to make an apple pie,

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:50.000
you must first invent the universe."

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.000
But he was not right.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:55.000
In Boltzmann's scenario, if you want to make an apple pie,

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:58.000
you just wait for the random motion of atoms

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.000
to make you an apple pie.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.000
That will happen much more frequently

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:04.000
than the random motions of atoms

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:06.000
making you an apple orchard

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.000
and some sugar and an oven,

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.000
and then making you an apple pie.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:13.000
So this scenario makes predictions.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.000
And the predictions are

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:18.000
that the fluctuations that make us are minimal.

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:21.000
Even if you imagine that this room we are in now

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.000
exists and is real and here we are,

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.000
and we have, not only our memories,

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.000
but our impression that outside there's something

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:31.000
called Caltech and the United States and the Milky Way Galaxy,

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:34.000
it's much easier for all those impressions to randomly fluctuate into your brain

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.000
than for them actually to randomly fluctuate

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:39.000
into Caltech, the United States and the galaxy.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.000
The good news is that,

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:44.000
therefore, this scenario does not work; it is not right.

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:47.000
This scenario predicts that we should be a minimal fluctuation.

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.000
Even if you left our galaxy out,

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.000
you would not get a hundred billion other galaxies.

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.000
And Feynman also understood this.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:57.000
Feynman says, "From the hypothesis that the world is a fluctuation,

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.000
all the predictions are that

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.000
if we look at a part of the world we've never seen before,

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.000
we will find it mixed up, and not like the piece we've just looked at --

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:05.000
high entropy.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:07.000
If our order were due to a fluctuation,

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:09.000
we would not expect order anywhere but where we have just noticed it.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:13.000
We therefore conclude the universe is not a fluctuation."

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:16.000
So that's good. The question is then what is the right answer?

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.000
If the universe is not a fluctuation,

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:21.000
why did the early universe have a low entropy?

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:24.000
And I would love to tell you the answer, but I'm running out of time.

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:26.000
(Laughter)

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.000
Here is the universe that we tell you about,

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.000
versus the universe that really exists.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.000
I just showed you this picture.

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.000
The universe is expanding for the last 10 billion years or so.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.000
It's cooling off.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.000
But we now know enough about the future of the universe

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.000
to say a lot more.

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:42.000
If the dark energy remains around,

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:45.000
the stars around us will use up their nuclear fuel, they will stop burning.

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:47.000
They will fall into black holes.

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:49.000
We will live in a universe

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:51.000
with nothing in it but black holes.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:55.000
That universe will last 10 to the 100 years --

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.000
a lot longer than our little universe has lived.

00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:59.000
The future is much longer than the past.

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.000
But even black holes don't last forever.

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:03.000
They will evaporate,

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:05.000
and we will be left with nothing but empty space.

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:09.000
That empty space lasts essentially forever.

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:12.000
However, you notice, since empty space gives off radiation,

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.000
there's actually thermal fluctuations,

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.000
and it cycles around

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.000
all the different possible combinations

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:21.000
of the degrees of freedom that exist in empty space.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.000
So even though the universe lasts forever,

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:25.000
there's only a finite number of things

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:27.000
that can possibly happen in the universe.

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:29.000
They all happen over a period of time

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:32.000
equal to 10 to the 10 to the 120 years.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.000
So here's two questions for you.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:37.000
Number one: If the universe lasts for 10 to the 10 to the 120 years,

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:39.000
why are we born

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:42.000
in the first 14 billion years of it,

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:45.000
in the warm, comfortable afterglow of the Big Bang?

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.000
Why aren't we in empty space?

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:49.000
You might say, "Well there's nothing there to be living,"

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:51.000
but that's not right.

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:53.000
You could be a random fluctuation out of the nothingness.

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.000
Why aren't you?

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:58.000
More homework assignment for you.

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:00.000
So like I said, I don't actually know the answer.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.000
I'm going to give you my favorite scenario.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:05.000
Either it's just like that. There is no explanation.

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:07.000
This is a brute fact about the universe

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:10.000
that you should learn to accept and stop asking questions.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:13.000
Or maybe the Big Bang

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:15.000
is not the beginning of the universe.

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:18.000
An egg, an unbroken egg, is a low entropy configuration,

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:20.000
and yet, when we open our refrigerator,

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:22.000
we do not go, "Hah, how surprising to find

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:24.000
this low entropy configuration in our refrigerator."

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:27.000
That's because an egg is not a closed system;

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:29.000
it comes out of a chicken.

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:33.000
Maybe the universe comes out of a universal chicken.

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:35.000
Maybe there is something that naturally,

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:38.000
through the growth of the laws of physics,

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:40.000
gives rise to universe like ours

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.000
in low entropy configurations.

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:44.000
If that's true, it would happen more than once;

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:47.000
we would be part of a much bigger multiverse.

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:49.000
That's my favorite scenario.

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:52.000
So the organizers asked me to end with a bold speculation.

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:54.000
My bold speculation

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:57.000
is that I will be absolutely vindicated by history.

00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:59.000
And 50 years from now,

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:02.000
all of my current wild ideas will be accepted as truths

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:05.000
by the scientific and external communities.

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:07.000
We will all believe that our little universe

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:10.000
is just a small part of a much larger multiverse.

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:13.000
And even better, we will understand what happened at the Big Bang

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:15.000
in terms of a theory

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:17.000
that we will be able to compare to observations.

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:19.000
This is a prediction. I might be wrong.

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:21.000
But we've been thinking as a human race

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:23.000
about what the universe was like,

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:26.000
why it came to be in the way it did for many, many years.

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:29.000
It's exciting to think we may finally know the answer someday.

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:31.000
Thank you.

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:33.000
(Applause)
