00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
It's great being here at TED.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
You know, I think there might be some presentations

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
that will go over my head,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
but the most amazing concepts

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
are the ones that go right under my feet.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
The little things in life,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
sometimes that we forget about,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
like pollination, that we take for granted.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
And you can't tell the story about pollinators --

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
bees, bats, hummingbirds, butterflies --

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
without telling the story about the invention of flowers

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
and how they co-evolved

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
over 50 million years.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
I've been filming time-lapse flowers

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
24 hours a day, seven days a week,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
for over 35 years.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
To watch them move

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
is a dance I'm never going to get tired of.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
It fills me with wonder, and it opens my heart.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Beauty and seduction, I believe,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
is nature's tool for survival,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
because we will protect what we fall in love with.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
Their relationship

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
is a love story that feeds the Earth.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
It reminds us that we are a part of nature,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
and we're not separate from it.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000
When I heard about the vanishing bees, Colony Collapse Disorder,

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
it motivated me to take action.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
We depend on pollinators

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000
for over a third of the fruits and vegetables we eat.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
And many scientists believe

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
it's the most serious issue facing mankind.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
It's like the canary in the coalmine.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
If they disappear, so do we.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
It reminds us that we are a part of nature

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
and we need to take care of it.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
What motivated me to film their behavior

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
was something that I asked my scientific advisers:

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
"What motivates the pollinators?"

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
Well, their answer was,

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
"It's all about risk and reward."

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
Like a wide-eyed kid, I'd say, "Why is that?"

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
And they'd say, "Well, because they want to survive."

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
I go, "Why?"

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
"Well, in order to reproduce."

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
"Well, why?"

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
And I thought that they'd probably say, "Well, it's all about sex."

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
And Chip Taylor, our monarch butterfly expert,

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.000
he replied, "Nothing lasts forever.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
Everything in the universe wears out."

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
And that blew my mind.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
Because I realized

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
that nature had invented reproduction

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000
as a mechanism for life to move forward,

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000
as a life force that passes right through us

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.000
and makes us a link in the evolution of life.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
Rarely seen by the naked eye,

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
this intersection

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
between the animal world and the plant world

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
is truly a magic moment.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
It's the mystical moment

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000
where life regenerates itself,

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000
over and over again.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000
So here is some nectar from my film.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
I hope you'll drink, tweet

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
and plant some seeds

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000
to pollinate a friendly garden.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.000
And always take time to smell the flowers,

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
and let it fill you with beauty,

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
and rediscover that sense of wonder.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
Here are some images from the film.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:10.000
(Music)

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:15.000
(Applause)

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.000
Thank you.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.000
Thank you very much.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:23.000
(Applause)

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.000
Thank you.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.000
(Applause)
