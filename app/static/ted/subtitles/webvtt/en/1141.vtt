00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
My journey to become a polar specialist,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
photographing, specializing
in the polar regions,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
began when I was four years old,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
when my family moved from southern Canada

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
to Northern Baffin Island,
up by Greenland.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
There we lived with the Inuit

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
in the tiny Inuit community
of 200 Inuit people,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
where [we] were one
of three non-Inuit families.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
And in this community,
we didn't have a television;

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
we didn't have computers,
obviously, radio.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
We didn't even have a telephone.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
All of my time was spent outside

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
with the Inuit, playing.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
The snow and the ice were my sandbox,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
and the Inuit were my teachers.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
And that's where I became

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
truly obsessed with this polar realm.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
And I knew someday that
I was going to do something

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
that had to do with trying
to share news about it

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
and protect it.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
I'd like to share with you,
for just two minutes only,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
some images, a cross-section of my work,

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
to the beautiful music
by Brandi Carlile, "Have You Ever."

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
I don't know why National Geographic
has done this, they've never done this before,

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
but they're allowing me
to show you a few images

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
from a coverage that I've just completed
that is not published yet.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
National Geographic doesn't do this,

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
so I'm very excited to be able
to share this with you.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
And what these images are --

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
you'll see them at the start of the slide show --
there's only about four images --

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
but it's of a little bear
that lives in the Great Bear Rainforest.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
It's pure white,
but it's not a polar bear.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
It's a spirit bear,
or a Kermode bear.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
There are only 200 of these bears left.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
They're more rare than the panda bear.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
I sat there on the river
for two months without seeing one.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
I thought, my career's over.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
I proposed this stupid story
to National Geographic.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
What in the heck was I thinking?

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
So I had two months to sit there

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
and figure out different ways
of what I was going to do in my next life,

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
after I was a photographer,
because they were going to fire me.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
Because National Geographic is a magazine;
they remind us all the time:

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
they publish pictures, not excuses.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.000
(Laughter)

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
And after two months of sitting there --

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
one day, thinking that it was all over,

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
this incredible big white male came down,

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
right beside me, three feet away from me,

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
and he went down and grabbed a fish
and went off in the forest and ate it.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
And then I spent the entire day
living my childhood dream

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
of walking around with this bear
through the forest.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
He went through this old-growth forest

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000
and sat up beside this 400-year-old
culturally modified tree and went to sleep.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000
And I actually got to sleep
within three feet of him,

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000
just in the forest, and photograph him.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000
So I'm very excited to be able
to show you those images

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
and a cross-section of my work
that I've done on the polar regions.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
Please enjoy.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.000

(Applause)

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.000
Paul Nicklen: Thank you very much.
The show's not over.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000
My clock is ticking. OK, let's stop.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000
Thank you very much. I appreciate it.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000
We're inundated with news all the time

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000
that the sea ice is disappearing

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000
and it's at its lowest level.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000
And in fact, scientists
were originally saying

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.000
sea ice is going to disappear
in the next hundred years, then they said 50 years.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.000
Now they're saying
the sea ice in the Arctic,

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000
the summertime extent is going to be gone
in the next four to 10 years.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000
And what does that mean?

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.000
After a while of reading this in the news,
it just becomes news.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000
You glaze over with it.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000
And what I'm trying to do
with my work is put faces to this.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000
And I want people to understand
and get the concept

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000
that, if we lose ice,

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.000
we stand to lose an entire ecosystem.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.000
Projections are that we could
lose polar bears, they could become extinct

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000
in the next 50 to 100 years.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000
And there's no better, sexier,

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.000
more beautiful,
charismatic megafauna species

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.000
for me to hang my campaign on.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.000
Polar bears are amazing hunters.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000
This was a bear I sat with
for a while on the shores.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000
There was no ice around.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.000
But this glacier caved into the water
and a seal got on it.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000
And this bear swam out to that seal --

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.000
800 lb. bearded seal --

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.000
grabbed it, swam back and ate it.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.000
And he was so full,
he was so happy and so fat eating this seal,

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000
that, as I approached him --

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.000
about 20 feet away --
to get this picture,

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.000
his only defense was to keep eating more seal.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.000
And as he ate, he was so full --

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.000
he probably had about
200 lbs of meat in his belly --

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.000
and as he ate inside
one side of his mouth,

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.000
he was regurgitating
out the other side of his mouth.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.000
So as long as these bears
have any bit of ice they will survive,

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.000
but it's the ice that's disappearing.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.000
We're finding more and more
dead bears in the Arctic.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000
When I worked on polar bears
as a biologist 20 years ago,

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000
we never found dead bears.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000
And in the last four or five years,

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.000
we're finding dead bears
popping up all over the place.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.000
We're seeing them in the Beaufort Sea,

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000
floating in the open ocean
where the ice has melted out.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.000
I found a couple in Norway last year.
We're seeing them on the ice.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000
These bears are already showing signs

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000
of the stress of disappearing ice.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.000
Here's a mother and her two year-old cub

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.000
were traveling on a ship a hundred miles
offshore in the middle of nowhere,

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.000
and they're riding
on this big piece of glacier ice,

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000
which is great for them;
they're safe at this point.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000
They're not going to die of hypothermia.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000
They're going to get to land.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.000
But unfortunately,
95 percent of the glaciers in the Arctic

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.000
are also receding right now

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.000
to the point that the ice
is ending up on land

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.000
and not injecting any ice
back into the ecosystem.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.000
These ringed seals,
these are the "fatsicles" of the Arctic.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.000
These little, fat dumplings,

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.000
150-pound bundles of blubber

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.000
are the mainstay of the polar bear.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:26.000
And they're not like
the harbor seals that you have here.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.000
These ringed seals also
live out their entire life cycle

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:32.000
associated and connected to sea ice.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.000
They give birth inside the ice,

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:37.000
and they feed on the Arctic cod
that live under the ice.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.000
And here's a picture of sick ice.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.000
This is a piece of multi-year ice
that's 12 years old.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:45.000
And what scientists didn't predict
is that, as this ice melts,

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.000
these big pockets
of black water are forming

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.000
and they're grabbing the sun's energy

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000
and accelerating the melting process.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000
And here we are diving
in the Beaufort Sea.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.000
The visibility's 600 ft.;
we're on our safety lines;

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.000
the ice is moving all over the place.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.000
I wish I could spend half
an hour telling you

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.000
about how we almost died on this dive.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.000
But what's important in this picture
is that you have a piece of multi-year ice,

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.000
that big chunk of ice up in the corner.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.000
In that one single piece of ice,

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000
you have 300 species of microorganisms.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.000
And in the spring,
when the sun returns to the ice,

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.000
it forms the phytoplankton,
grows under that ice,

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:20.000
and then you get bigger sheets of seaweed,

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.000
and then you get the
zooplankton feeding on all that life.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.000
So really what the ice does

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000
is it acts like a garden.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:29.000
It acts like the soil in a garden.
It's an inverted garden.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000
Losing that ice is like
losing the soil in a garden.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.000
Here's me in my office.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.000
I hope you appreciate yours.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:38.000
This is after an hour under the ice.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.000
I can't feel my lips; my face is frozen;

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000
I can't feel my hands;
I can't feel my feet.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.000
And I've come up, and all I wanted
to do was get out of the water.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.000
After an hour in these conditions,

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.000
it's so extreme that, when I go down,

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000
almost every dive I vomit into my regulator

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:54.000
because my body can't deal
with the stress of the cold on my head.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.000
And so I'm just so happy
that the dive is over.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.000
I get to hand my camera to my assistant,

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:01.000
and I'm looking up at him,
and I'm going, "Woo. Woo. Woo."

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.000
Which means, "Take my camera."

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.000
And he thinks I'm saying,
"Take my picture."

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:08.000
So we had this little
communication breakdown.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:11.000
(Laughter)

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.000
But it's worth it.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.000
I'm going to show you pictures
of beluga whales, bowhead whales,

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:18.000
and narwhals, and polar bears,
and leopard seals today,

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:21.000
but this picture right here means more
to me than any other I've ever made.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:24.000
I dropped down in this ice hole,
just through that hole that you just saw,

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.000
and I looked up under
the underside of the ice,

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.000
and I was dizzy;
I thought I had vertigo.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.000
I got very nervous --
no rope, no safety line,

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.000
the whole world is moving around me --

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.000
and I thought, "I'm in trouble."

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.000
But what happened
is that the entire underside

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.000
was full of these billions
of amphipods and copepods

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:42.000
moving around and feeding
on the underside of the ice,

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:44.000
giving birth and living out
their entire life cycle.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:47.000
This is the foundation of the whole food chain
in the Arctic, right here.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:50.000
And when you have low 
productivity in this, in ice,

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:53.000
the productivity in copepods go down.

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.000
This is a bowhead whale.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.000
Supposedly, science is stating

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:00.000
that it could be the oldest living animal
on earth right now.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.000
This very whale right here
could be over 250 years old.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.000
This whale could have been born

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.000
around the start
of the Industrial Revolution.

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:10.000
It could have survived
150 years of whaling.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:13.000
And now its biggest threat
is the disappearance of ice in the North

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:16.000
because of the lives
that we're leading in the South.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.000
Narwhals, these majestic narwhals

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:21.000
with their eight-foot long ivory tusks,
don't have to be here;

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.000
they could be out on the open water.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:26.000
But they're forcing themselves
to come up in these tiny little ice holes

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.000
where they can breathe, catch a breath,

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:31.000
because right under that ice
are all the swarms of cod.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:33.000
And the cod are there

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:36.000
because they are feeding
on all the copepods and amphipods.

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:39.000
Alright, my favorite part.

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.000
When I'm on my deathbed,

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.000
I'm going to remember
one story more than any other.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:46.000
Even though that spirit bear
moment was powerful,

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.000
I don't think I'll ever have
another experience

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.000
like I did with these leopard seals.

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:53.000
Leopard seals, since the time of Shackleton,
have had a bad reputation.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.000
They've got that wryly smile
on their mouth.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.000
They've got those black sinister eyes

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.000
and those spots on their body.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:02.000
They look positively prehistoric
and a bit scary.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:04.000
And tragically in [2003],

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:07.000
a scientist was taken down
and drowned,

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.000
and she was being consumed
by a leopard seal.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:12.000
And people were like, "We knew
they were vicious. We knew they were."

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.000
And so people love to form their opinions.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.000
And that's when I got a story idea:

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.000
I want to go to Antarctica,

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.000
get in the water with as many
leopard seals as I possibly can

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.000
and give them a fair shake --

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:25.000
find out if they really are these vicious
animals, or if they're misunderstood.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.000
So this is that story.

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:30.000
Oh, and they also happen
to eat Happy Feet.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:33.000
(Laughter)

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:36.000
As a species, as humans,
we like to say penguins are really cute,

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:39.000
therefore, leopard seals eat them,
so leopard seals are ugly and bad.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.000
It doesn't work that way.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:43.000
The penguin doesn't know it's cute,

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.000
and the leopard seal doesn't
know it's kind of big and monstrous.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:48.000
This is just the food chain unfolding.

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.000
They're also big.

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.000
They're not these little harbor seals.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.000
They are 12 ft. long, a thousand pounds.

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:57.000
And they're also curiously aggressive.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:00.000
You get 12 tourists packed into a Zodiac,

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.000
floating in these icy waters,

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.000
and a leopard seal comes up
and bites the pontoon.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:07.000
The boat starts to sink, they race back to the ship

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:09.000
and get to go home and tell
the stories of how they got attacked.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:11.000
All the leopard seal was doing --

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.000
it's just biting a balloon.

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:15.000
It just sees this big balloon in the ocean --
it doesn't have hands --

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:18.000
it's going to take a little bite,
the boat pops, and off they go.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.000
(Laughter)

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:23.000
So after five days of crossing
the Drake Passage --

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:26.000
isn't that beautiful --

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:29.000
after five days of crossing
the Drake Passage,

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:31.000
we have finally arrived at Antarctica.

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:33.000
I'm with my Swedish assistant and guide.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:37.000
His name is Goran Ehlme
from Sweden -- Goran.

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:40.000
And he has a lot of experience
with leopard seals. I have never seen one.

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:43.000
So we come around the cove
in our little Zodiac boat,

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:45.000
and there's this monstrous leopard seal.

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:47.000
And even in his voice, he goes,
"That's a bloody big seal, ya."

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:49.000
(Laughter)

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:52.000
And this seal is taking
this penguin by the head,

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.000
and it's flipping it back and forth.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.000
And what it's trying to do
is turn that penguin inside-out,

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:59.000
so it can eat the meat off the bones,

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.000
and then it goes off and gets another one.

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:03.000
And so this leopard seal
grabbed another penguin,

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:05.000
came under the boat, the Zodiac,

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:07.000
starting hitting the hull of the boat.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:09.000
And we're trying to not fall in the water.

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:12.000
And we sit down,
and that's when Goran said to me,

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.000
"This is a good seal, ya.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.000
It's time for you to get in the water."

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:19.000
(Laughter)

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:22.000
And I looked at Goran,
and I said to him, "Forget that."

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:26.000
But I think I probably used a different word
starting with the letter "F."

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:28.000
But he was right.

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.000
He scolded me out,
and said, "This is why we're here.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.000
And you purposed this stupid story
to National Geographic.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.000
And now you've got to deliver.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:36.000
And you can't publish excuses."

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.000
So I had such dry mouth --

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.000
probably not as bad as now --

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:44.000
but I had such, such dry mouth.

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:47.000
And my legs were just trembling.
I couldn't feel my legs.

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:49.000
I put my flippers on.
I could barely part my lips.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:51.000
I put my snorkel in my mouth,

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:54.000
and I rolled over the side
of the Zodiac into the water.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.000
And this was the first thing she did.

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:59.000
She came racing up to me,
engulfed my whole camera --

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:02.000
and her teeth are up here
and down here --

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:05.000
but Goran, before I had gotten in the water,
had given me amazing advice.

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:09.000
He said, "If you get scared,
you close your eyes, ya, and she'll go away."

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:12.000
(Laughter)

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:14.000
So that's all I had to work
with at that point.

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.000
But I just started to shoot these pictures.

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.000
So she did this threat display
for a few minutes,

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:21.000
and then the most amazing thing happened --
she totally relaxed.

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:23.000
She went off, she got a penguin.

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:25.000
She stopped about 10 feet away from me,

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:28.000
and she sat there with this penguin,
the penguin's flapping, and she let's it go.

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:31.000
The penguin swims toward me, takes off.

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:33.000
She grabs another one.
She does this over and over.

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:35.000
And it dawned on me
that she's trying to feed me a penguin.

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:39.000
Why else would she release
these penguins at me?

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:42.000
And after she did this four or five times,

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:45.000
she swam by me
with this dejected look on her face.

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:48.000
You don't want to be too anthropomorphic,
but I swear that she looked at me

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:50.000
like, "This useless predator's
going to starve in my ocean."

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:55.000
(Laughter)

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:57.000
So realizing I couldn't catch
swimming penguins,

00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:59.000
she'd get these other penguins
and bring them slowly towards me,

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:01.000
bobbing like this,
and she'd let them go.

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.000
This didn't work.

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:05.000
I was laughing so hard and so emotional

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:07.000
that my mask was flooding,
because I was crying underwater,

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:09.000
just because it was so amazing.

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:11.000
And so that didn't work.

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:13.000
So then she'd get another penguin
and try this ballet-like sexy display

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:16.000
sliding down this iceberg like this. (Laughter)

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:18.000
And she would sort of bring them
over to me and offer it to me.

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.000
This went on for four days.

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:22.000
This just didn't happen a couple of times.

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:24.000
And then so she realized
I couldn't catch live ones,

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:26.000
so she brought me dead penguins.

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:29.000
(Laughter)

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:33.000
Now I've got four or five penguins
floating around my head,

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:36.000
and I'm just sitting there shooting away.

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:39.000
And she would often stop
and have this dejected look on her face

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:41.000
like, "Are you for real?"

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:43.000
Because she can't believe
I can't eat this penguin.

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:45.000
Because in her world,
you're either breeding or you're eating --

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:47.000
and I'm not breeding, so ...

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:49.000
(Laughter)

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:52.000
And then that wasn't enough;
she started to flip penguins onto my head.

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:54.000
She was trying to force-feed me.
She's pushing me around.

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:56.000
She's trying to force-feed my camera,

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:59.000
which is every photographer's dream.

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:02.000
And she would get frustrated;
she'd blow bubbles in my face.

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:04.000
She would, I think, let me know
that I was going to starve.

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:06.000
But yet she didn't stop.

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:08.000
She would not stop
trying to feed me penguins.

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:10.000
And on the last day with this female

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:12.000
where I thought I had pushed her too far,

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:15.000
I got nervous because she came up to me,

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:17.000
she rolled over on her back,

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:20.000
and she did this deep, guttural
jackhammer sound, this gok-gok-gok-gok.

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:22.000
And I thought, she's about to bite.

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:25.000
She's about to let me know
she's too frustrated with me.

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:28.000
What had happened
was another seal had snuck in behind me,

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:30.000
and she did that to threat display.

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:32.000
She chased that big seal away,
went and got its penguin

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:34.000
and brought it to me.

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:37.000
(Laughter)

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:39.000
That wasn't the only seal
I got in the water with.

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:42.000
I got in the water
with 30 other leopard seals,

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:45.000
and I never once had a scary encounter.

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:47.000
They are the most remarkable animals
I've ever worked with,

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:49.000
and the same with polar bears.

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:51.000
And just like the polar bears,

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:54.000
these animals depend
on an icy environment.

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:59.000
I get emotional. Sorry.

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:02.000
It's a story that lives deep in my heart,

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:04.000
and I'm proud to share this with you.

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:06.000
And I'm so passionate about it.

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:09.000
Anybody want to come with me
to Antarctica or the Arctic, I'll take you; let's go.

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:11.000
We've got to get the story out now.
Thank you very much.

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:13.000
(Applause)

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:15.000
Thank you.

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:19.000
(Applause)

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:21.000
Thank you.

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:27.000
(Applause)

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:29.000
Thank you. Thanks very much.

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:31.000
(Applause)

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:33.000
Thank you.

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:35.000
(Applause)
