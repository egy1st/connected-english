WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Thank you.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
I'm thrilled to be here.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
I'm going to talk about a new, old material

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
that still continues to amaze us,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
and that might impact the way we think

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
about material science, high technology --

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
and maybe, along the way,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
also do some stuff for medicine and for global health and help reforestation.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
So that's kind of a bold statement.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
I'll tell you a little bit more.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
This material actually has some traits that make it seem almost too good to be true.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
It's sustainable; it's a sustainable material

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
that is processed all in water and at room temperature --

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
and is biodegradable with a clock,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
so you can watch it dissolve instantaneously in a glass of water

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
or have it stable for years.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
It's edible; it's implantable in the human body

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
without causing any immune response.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
It actually gets reintegrated in the body.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
And it's technological,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
so it can do things like microelectronics,

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
and maybe photonics do.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
And the material

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
looks something like this.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
In fact, this material you see is clear and transparent.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
The components of this material are just water and protein.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
So this material is silk.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
So it's kind of different

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
from what we're used to thinking about silk.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
So the question is, how do you reinvent something

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
that has been around for five millennia?

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
The process of discovery, generally, is inspired by nature.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
And so we marvel at silk worms --

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
the silk worm you see here spinning its fiber.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
The silk worm does a remarkable thing:

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
it uses these two ingredients, protein and water,

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
that are in its gland,

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
to make a material that is exceptionally tough for protection --

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
so comparable to technical fibers

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
like Kevlar.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
And so in the reverse engineering process

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
that we know about,

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
and that we're familiar with,

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
for the textile industry,

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
the textile industry goes and unwinds the cocoon

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
and then weaves glamorous things.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
We want to know how you go from water and protein

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
to this liquid Kevlar, to this natural Kevlar.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
So the insight

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
is how do you actually reverse engineer this

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
and go from cocoon to gland

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
and get water and protein that is your starting material.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
And this is an insight

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
that came, about two decades ago,

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.000
from a person that I'm very fortunate to work with,

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
David Kaplan.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
And so we get this starting material.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000
And so this starting material is back to the basic building block.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
And then we use this to do a variety of things --

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
like, for example, this film.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
And we take advantage of something that is very simple.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
The recipe to make those films

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
is to take advantage of the fact

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
that proteins are extremely smart at what they do.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
They find their way to self-assemble.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000
So the recipe is simple: you take the silk solution, you pour it,

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
and you wait for the protein to self-assemble.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
And then you detach the protein and you get this film,

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
as the proteins find each other as the water evaporates.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
But I mentioned that the film is also technological.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
And so what does that mean?

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000
It means that you can interface it

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
with some of the things that are typical of technology,

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
like microelectronics and nanoscale technology.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
And the image of the DVD here

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
is just to illustrate a point

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.000
that silk follows very subtle topographies of the surface,

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000
which means that it can replicate features on the nanoscale.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000
So it would be able to replicate the information

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000
that is on the DVD.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000
And we can store information that's film with water and protein.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000
So we tried something out, and we wrote a message in a piece of silk,

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000
which is right here, and the message is over there.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000
And much like in the DVD, you can read it out optically.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000
And this requires a stable hand,

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.000
so this is why I decided to do it onstage in front of a thousand people.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000
So let me see.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
So as you see the film go in transparently through there,

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000
and then ...

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:45.000
(Applause)

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000
And the most remarkable feat

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.000
is that my hand actually stayed still long enough to do that.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.000
So once you have these attributes

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000
of this material,

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000
then you can do a lot of things.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
It's actually not limited to films.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.000
And so the material can assume a lot of formats.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.000
And then you go a little crazy, and so you do various optical components

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000
or you do microprism arrays,

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000
like the reflective tape that you have on your running shoes.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000
Or you can do beautiful things

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000
that, if the camera can capture, you can make.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.000
You can add a third dimensionality to the film.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000
And if the angle is right,

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.000
you can actually see a hologram appear in this film of silk.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.000
But you can do other things.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000
You can imagine that then maybe you can use a pure protein to guide light,

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000
and so we've made optical fibers.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.000
But silk is versatile and it goes beyond optics.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000
And you can think of different formats.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.000
So for instance, if you're afraid of going to the doctor and getting stuck with a needle,

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000
we do microneedle arrays.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000
What you see there on the screen is a human hair

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000
superimposed on the needle that's made of silk --

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000
just to give you a sense of size.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000
You can do bigger things.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000
You can do gears and nuts and bolts --

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.000
that you can buy at Whole Foods.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.000
And the gears work in water as well.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000
So you think of alternative mechanical parts.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000
And maybe you can use that liquid Kevlar if you need something strong

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000
to replace peripheral veins, for example,

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000
or maybe an entire bone.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000
And so you have here a little example

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000
of a small skull --

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000
what we call mini Yorick.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.000
(Laughter)

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.000
But you can do things like cups, for example,

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.000
and so, if you add a little bit of gold, if you add a little bit of semiconductors

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.000
you could do sensors that stick on the surfaces of foods.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000
You can do electronic pieces

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000
that fold and wrap.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000
Or if you're fashion forward, some silk LED tattoos.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000
So there's versatility, as you see,

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.000
in the material formats,

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.000
that you can do with silk.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000
But there are still some unique traits.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.000
I mean, why would you want to do all these things for real?

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000
I mentioned it briefly at the beginning;

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000
the protein is biodegradable and biocompatible.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.000
And you see here a picture of a tissue section.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.000
And so what does that mean, that it's biodegradable and biocompatible?

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.000
You can implant it in the body without needing to retrieve what is implanted.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:00.000
Which means that all the devices that you've seen before and all the formats,

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000
in principle, can be implanted and disappear.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000
And what you see there in that tissue section,

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.000
in fact, is you see that reflector tape.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.000
So, much like you're seen at night by a car,

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.000
then the idea is that you can see, if you illuminate tissue,

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.000
you can see deeper parts of tissue

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.000
because there is that reflective tape there that is made out of silk.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000
And you see there, it gets reintegrated in tissue.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000
And reintegration in the human body

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000
is not the only thing,

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.000
but reintegration in the environment is important.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000
So you have a clock, you have protein,

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000
and now a silk cup like this

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:34.000
can be thrown away without guilt --

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:41.000
(Applause)

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.000
unlike the polystyrene cups

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.000
that unfortunately fill our landfills everyday.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000
It's edible,

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000
so you can do smart packaging around food

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000
that you can cook with the food.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000
It doesn't taste good,

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.000
so I'm going to need some help with that.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.000
But probably the most remarkable thing is that it comes full circle.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000
Silk, during its self-assembly process,

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000
acts like a cocoon for biological matter.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.000
And so if you change the recipe,

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.000
and you add things when you pour --

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.000
so you add things to your liquid silk solution --

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.000
where these things are enzymes

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.000
or antibodies or vaccines,

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.000
the self-assembly process

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.000
preserves the biological function of these dopants.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:23.000
So it makes the materials environmentally active

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.000
and interactive.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.000
So that screw that you thought about beforehand

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000
can actually be used

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:32.000
to screw a bone together -- a fractured bone together --

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.000
and deliver drugs at the same,

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:37.000
while your bone is healing, for example.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:40.000
Or you could put drugs in your wallet and not in your fridge.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.000
So we've made a silk card

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.000
with penicillin in it.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.000
And we stored penicillin at 60 degrees C,

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.000
so 140 degrees Fahrenheit,

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:52.000
for two months without loss of efficacy of the penicillin.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000
And so that could be ---

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:58.000
(Applause)

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000
that could be potentially a good alternative

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.000
to solar powered refrigerated camels. (Laughter)

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.000
And of course, there's no use in storage if you can't use [it].

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:10.000
And so there is this other unique material trait

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:13.000
that these materials have, that they're programmably degradable.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.000
And so what you see there is the difference.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.000
In the top, you have a film that has been programmed not to degrade,

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:21.000
and in the bottom, a film that has been programmed to degrade in water.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.000
And what you see is that the film on the bottom

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.000
releases what is inside it.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:28.000
So it allows for the recovery of what we've stored before.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.000
And so this allows for a controlled delivery of drugs

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:34.000
and for reintegration in the environment

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.000
in all of these formats that you've seen.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.000
So the thread of discovery that we have really is a thread.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.000
We're impassioned with this idea that whatever you want to do,

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.000
whether you want to replace a vein or a bone,

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:47.000
or maybe be more sustainable in microelectronics,

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.000
perhaps drink a coffee in a cup

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000
and throw it away without guilt,

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.000
maybe carry your drugs in your pocket,

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.000
deliver them inside your body

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.000
or deliver them across the desert,

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.000
the answer may be in a thread of silk.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.000
Thank you.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:19.000
(Applause)
