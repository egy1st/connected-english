00:00:00.746 --> 00:00:03.452
When I was a child, I always
wanted to be a superhero.

00:00:03.476 --> 00:00:06.912
I wanted to save the world
and make everyone happy.

00:00:06.936 --> 00:00:10.729
But I knew that I'd need superpowers
to make my dreams come true.

00:00:10.753 --> 00:00:12.976
So I used to embark
on these imaginary journeys

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.489
to find intergalactic objects
from planet Krypton,

00:00:16.513 --> 00:00:19.227
which was a lot of fun,
but didn't yield much result.

00:00:20.061 --> 00:00:21.800
When I grew up and realized

00:00:21.824 --> 00:00:24.976
that science fiction was not
a good source for superpowers,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.322
I decided instead to embark
on a journey of real science,

00:00:28.346 --> 00:00:29.976
to find a more useful truth.

00:00:30.595 --> 00:00:32.976
I started my journey in California,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.245
with a UC Berkeley
30-year longitudinal study

00:00:36.269 --> 00:00:39.976
that examined the photos
of students in an old yearbook,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.542
and tried to measure their success
and well-being throughout their life.

00:00:44.566 --> 00:00:46.614
By measuring the students' smiles,

00:00:46.638 --> 00:00:48.423
researchers were able to predict

00:00:48.447 --> 00:00:52.664
how fulfilling and long-lasting
a subject's marriage would be,

00:00:52.688 --> 00:00:53.750
(Laughter)

00:00:53.774 --> 00:00:57.695
how well she would score
on standardized tests of well-being,

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:00.000
and how inspiring she would be to others.

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:04.152
In another yearbook, I stumbled
upon Barry Obama's picture.

00:01:04.928 --> 00:01:06.403
When I first saw his picture,

00:01:06.427 --> 00:01:09.586
I thought that his superpowers
came from his super collar.

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:10.690
(Laughter)

00:01:10.714 --> 00:01:12.681
But now I know it was all in his smile.

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:19.006
Another aha! moment came from a 2010
Wayne State University research project

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:23.269
that looked into pre-1950s
baseball cards of Major League players.

00:01:23.776 --> 00:01:27.283
The researchers found
that the span of a player's smile

00:01:27.307 --> 00:01:29.976
could actually predict
the span of his life.

00:01:30.688 --> 00:01:32.976
Players who didn't smile in their pictures

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.976
lived an average of only 72.9 years,

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.581
where players with beaming smiles

00:01:38.605 --> 00:01:40.976
lived an average of almost 80 years.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.391
(Laughter)

00:01:43.415 --> 00:01:46.240
The good news is that
we're actually born smiling.

00:01:46.558 --> 00:01:48.543
Using 3D ultrasound technology,

00:01:48.567 --> 00:01:52.145
we can now see that developing
babies appear to smile,

00:01:52.169 --> 00:01:53.319
even in the womb.

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:56.976
When they're born,
babies continue to smile --

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.976
initially, mostly in their sleep.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.976
And even blind babies smile

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.389
to the sound of the human voice.

00:02:04.381 --> 00:02:06.976
Smiling is one of the most basic,
biologically uniform

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.437
expressions of all humans.

00:02:09.461 --> 00:02:11.525
In studies conducted in Papua New Guinea,

00:02:11.549 --> 00:02:15.820
Paul Ekman, the world's most renowned
researcher on facial expressions,

00:02:15.844 --> 00:02:18.976
found that even members of the Fore tribe,

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.172
who were completely disconnected
from Western culture,

00:02:22.196 --> 00:02:25.459
and also known for their
unusual cannibalism rituals,

00:02:25.483 --> 00:02:26.767
(Laughter)

00:02:26.791 --> 00:02:29.434
attributed smiles
to descriptions of situations

00:02:29.458 --> 00:02:31.402
the same way you and I would.

00:02:31.941 --> 00:02:33.633
So from Papua New Guinea

00:02:33.657 --> 00:02:36.831
to Hollywood

00:02:36.855 --> 00:02:40.267
all the way to modern art in Beijing,

00:02:40.291 --> 00:02:41.696
we smile often,

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:45.172
and use smiles to express
joy and satisfaction.

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:48.976
How many people here in this room
smile more than 20 times per day?

00:02:49.283 --> 00:02:50.735
Raise your hand if you do.

00:02:51.361 --> 00:02:52.520
Oh, wow.

00:02:52.902 --> 00:02:54.401
Outside of this room,

00:02:54.425 --> 00:02:57.735
more than a third of us smile
more than 20 times per day,

00:02:57.759 --> 00:03:01.926
whereas less than 14 percent of us
smile less than five.

00:03:02.322 --> 00:03:07.945
In fact, those with the most amazing
superpowers are actually children,

00:03:07.969 --> 00:03:10.976
who smile as many as 400 times per day.

00:03:11.831 --> 00:03:14.191
Have you ever wondered
why being around children,

00:03:14.215 --> 00:03:18.000
who smile so frequently,
makes you smile very often?

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.887
A recent study
at Uppsala University in Sweden

00:03:21.911 --> 00:03:26.776
found that it's very difficult to frown
when looking at someone who smiles.

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:28.222
You ask why?

00:03:28.246 --> 00:03:30.706
Because smiling
is evolutionarily contagious,

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:35.150
and it suppresses the control
we usually have on our facial muscles.

00:03:35.888 --> 00:03:39.316
Mimicking a smile
and experiencing it physically

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:42.976
helps us understand whether
our smile is fake or real,

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.427
so we can understand
the emotional state of the smiler.

00:03:47.276 --> 00:03:48.976
In a recent mimicking study

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.976
at the University
of Clermont-Ferrand in France,

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.976
subjects were asked to determine
whether a smile was real or fake

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.349
while holding a pencil in their mouth
to repress smiling muscles.

00:04:00.809 --> 00:04:03.713
Without the pencil,
subjects were excellent judges,

00:04:03.737 --> 00:04:05.617
but with the pencil in their mouth --

00:04:05.641 --> 00:04:08.236
when they could not mimic
the smile they saw --

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:10.166
their judgment was impaired.

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:11.976
(Laughter)

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.325
In addition to theorizing on evolution
in "The Origin of Species,"

00:04:15.349 --> 00:04:19.556
Charles Darwin also wrote
the facial feedback response theory.

00:04:19.889 --> 00:04:25.394
His theory states that the act of smiling
itself actually makes us feel better,

00:04:25.418 --> 00:04:29.410
rather than smiling being
merely a result of feeling good.

00:04:29.434 --> 00:04:34.000
In his study, Darwin actually cited
a French neurologist, Guillaume Duchenne,

00:04:34.024 --> 00:04:39.380
who sent electric jolts to facial muscles
to induce and stimulate smiles.

00:04:39.404 --> 00:04:41.308
Please, don't try this at home.

00:04:41.332 --> 00:04:42.976
(Laughter)

00:04:43.586 --> 00:04:45.285
In a related German study,

00:04:45.309 --> 00:04:48.976
researchers used fMRI imaging
to measure brain activity

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:54.436
before and after injecting Botox
to suppress smiling muscles.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.286
The finding supported Darwin's theory,

00:04:57.310 --> 00:04:59.183
by showing that facial feedback

00:04:59.207 --> 00:05:02.976
modifies the neural processing
of emotional content in the brain,

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000
in a way that helps us
feel better when we smile.

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:09.942
Smiling stimulates
our brain reward mechanism

00:05:09.966 --> 00:05:11.490
in a way that even chocolate --

00:05:11.514 --> 00:05:14.323
a well-regarded pleasure inducer --

00:05:14.347 --> 00:05:15.506
cannot match.

00:05:16.077 --> 00:05:19.243
British researchers found that one smile

00:05:19.267 --> 00:05:21.976
can generate the same level
of brain stimulation

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.976
as up to 2,000 bars of chocolate.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.648
(Laughter)

00:05:27.672 --> 00:05:28.831
Wait --

00:05:28.855 --> 00:05:32.662
The same study found
that smiling is as stimulating

00:05:32.686 --> 00:05:36.792
as receiving up to 16,000
pounds sterling in cash.

00:05:36.816 --> 00:05:37.817
(Laughter)

00:05:37.841 --> 00:05:39.686
That's like 25 grand a smile.

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:40.861
It's not bad.

00:05:41.443 --> 00:05:42.888
And think about it this way:

00:05:42.912 --> 00:05:45.601
25,000 times 400 --

00:05:45.625 --> 00:05:49.046
quite a few kids out there feel
like Mark Zuckerberg every day.

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:50.815
(Laughter)

00:05:50.839 --> 00:05:52.428
And unlike lots of chocolate,

00:05:52.452 --> 00:05:54.737
lots of smiling can actually
make you healthier.

00:05:55.198 --> 00:05:59.045
Smiling can help reduce the level
of stress-enhancing hormones

00:05:59.069 --> 00:06:02.250
like cortisol, adrenaline and dopamine,

00:06:02.274 --> 00:06:05.968
increase the level of mood-enhancing
hormones like endorphins,

00:06:05.992 --> 00:06:08.535
and reduce overall blood pressure.

00:06:08.853 --> 00:06:10.503
And if that's not enough,

00:06:10.527 --> 00:06:13.780
smiling can actually make you
look good in the eyes of others.

00:06:14.209 --> 00:06:17.976
A recent study at Penn State University
found that when you smile,

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.855
you don't only appear to be
more likable and courteous,

00:06:21.879 --> 00:06:24.976
but you actually appear
to be more competent.

00:06:25.801 --> 00:06:28.175
So whenever you want
to look great and competent,

00:06:28.199 --> 00:06:30.976
reduce your stress
or improve your marriage,

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:34.888
or feel as if you just had a whole stack
of high-quality chocolate

00:06:34.912 --> 00:06:36.976
without incurring the caloric cost,

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:42.833
or as if you found 25 grand in a pocket
of an old jacket you hadn't worn for ages,

00:06:42.857 --> 00:06:46.371
or whenever you want
to tap into a superpower

00:06:46.395 --> 00:06:49.357
that will help you and everyone around you

00:06:49.381 --> 00:06:53.184
live a longer, healthier, happier life,

00:06:53.208 --> 00:06:54.507
smile.

00:06:54.531 --> 00:06:59.238
(Applause)
