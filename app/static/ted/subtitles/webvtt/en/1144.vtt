00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
My name is Amit.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
And 18 months ago, I had another job at Google,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
and I pitched this idea

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
of doing something with museums and art

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
to my boss who's actually here,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
and she allowed me to do it.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
And it took 18 months.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
A lot of fun, negotiations and stories, I can tell you,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
with 17 very interesting museums from nine countries.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
But I'm going to focus on the demo.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
There are a lot of stories about why we did this.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
I think my personal story is explained very simply on the slide,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
and it's access.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
And I grew up in India.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
I had a great education -- I'm not complaining --

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
but I didn't have access to a lot of these museums and these artworks.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
And so when I started traveling and going to these museums,

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
I started learning a lot.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
And while working at Google,

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
I tried to put this desire

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
to make it more accessible with technology together.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
So we formed a team, a great team of people,

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
and we started doing this.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
I'm going to probably get into the demo

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
and then tell you a couple of the interesting things

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
we've had since launch.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000
So, simple: you come to GoogleArtProject.com.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
You look around at all these museums here.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
You've got the Uffizi, you've got the MoMA,

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
the Hermitage, the Rijks, the Van Gogh.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
I'm going to actually get to one of my favorites,

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
Two ways of going in -- very simple.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
Click and, bang, you're in this museum.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
It doesn't matter where you are --

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
Bombay, Mexico, it doesn't really matter.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
You move around, you have fun.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
You want to navigate around the museum?

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
Open the plan up,

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
and, in one click, jump.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
You're in there, you want to go to the end of the corridor.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
Keep going. Have fun.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
Explore.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:48.000
(Applause)

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
Thanks. I haven't come to the best part.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
(Laughter)

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
So now I'm in front of one of my favorite paintings,

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
"The Harvesters" by Pieter Bruegel at the Met.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
I see this plus sign.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
If the museum has given us the image, you click on it.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
Now this is one of the images.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
So this is all of the meta-data information.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
For those of you who are truly interested in art,

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
you can click this -- but I'm going to click this off right now.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
And this is one of these images that we captured

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
in what we call gigapixel technology.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
So this image, for example,

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
has close to, I think, around 10 billion pixels.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
And I get a lot of people asking me:

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
"What do you get for 10 billion pixels?"

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000
So I'm going to try and show you what you really get for 10 billion pixels.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
You can zoom around very simply.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
You see some fun stuff happening here.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
I love this guy; his expression is priceless.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
But then you really want to go deep.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
And so I started playing around,

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
and I found something going on over here.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
And I was like, "Hold on. That sounds interesting."

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
Went in, and I started noticing

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000
that these kids were actually beating something.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000
I did a little research, spoke to a couple of my contacts at the Met,

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000
and actually found out that this is a game

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
called squall,

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
which involves beating a goose with a stick

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
on Shrove Tuesday.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
And apparently it was quite popular.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
I don't know why they did it,

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
but I learned something about it.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000
Now just to get really deep in, you can really get to the cracks.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
Now just to give you some perspective,

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000
I'm going to zoom out so you really see what you get.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
Here is where we were,

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000
and this is the painting.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:25.000
(Applause)

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.000
The best is yet to come -- so in a second.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
So now let's just quickly

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000
jump into the MoMA, again in New York.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000
So another one of my favorites, "The Starry Night."

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000
Now the example I showed you was all about finding details.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000
But what if you want to see brush strokes?

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000
And what if you want to see

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000
how Van Gogh actually created this masterpiece?

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000
You zoom in. You really go in.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.000
I'm going to go to one of my favorite parts in this painting,

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.000
and I'm really going to get to the cracks.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000
This is "The Starry Night,"

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
I think, never seen like this before.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
I'm going to show you my other favorite feature.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
There's a lot of other stuff here, but I don't have time.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.000
This is the real cool part. It's called Collections.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000
Any one of you, anybody --

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000
doesn't matter if you're rich, if you're poor,

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.000
if you have a fancy house -- doesn't matter.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000
You can go and create your own museum online --

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.000
create your own collection across all these images.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000
Very simply, you go in --

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000
and I've created this, called The Power of Zoom --

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000
you can just zoom around.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000
This is "The Ambassadors," based in the National Gallery.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000
You can annotate the stuff, send it to your friends

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000
and really get a conversation going

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000
about what you're feeling

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000
when you go through these masterpieces.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000
So I think, in conclusion,

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000
for me, the main thing

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.000
is that all the amazing stuff here does not really come from Google.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000
It doesn't, in my opinion, even come from the museums.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000
I probably shouldn't say that.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000
It really comes from these artists.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.000
And that's been my humbling experience in this.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000
I mean, I hope in this digital medium

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000
that we do justice to their artwork

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.000
and represent it properly online.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000
And the biggest question I get asked nowadays

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000
is, "Did you do this

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000
to replicate the experience of going to a museum?"

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000
And the answer is no.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000
It's to supplement the experience.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000
And that's it. Thank you.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000
(Applause)

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000
Thank you.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000
(Applause)
