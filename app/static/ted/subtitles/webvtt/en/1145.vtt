WEBVTT

00:00:00.928 --> 00:00:02.785
I decided when I was asked to do this

00:00:02.809 --> 00:00:06.507
that what I really wanted to talk about
was my friend, Richard Feynman.

00:00:06.531 --> 00:00:09.976
I was one of the fortunate few
that really did get to know him

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:11.410
and enjoyed his presence.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.503
And I'm going to tell you
about the Richard Feynman that I knew.

00:00:15.527 --> 00:00:17.826
I'm sure there are people here
who could tell you

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:19.567
about the Richard Feynman they knew,

00:00:19.591 --> 00:00:22.116
and it would probably be
a different Richard Feynman.

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.123
Richard Feynman was a very complex man.

00:00:24.147 --> 00:00:26.123
He was a man of many, many parts.

00:00:26.464 --> 00:00:31.210
He was, of course, foremost,
a very, very, very great scientist.

00:00:31.798 --> 00:00:33.976
He was an actor. You saw him act.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.658
I also had the good fortune
to be in those lectures,

00:00:37.682 --> 00:00:38.976
up in the balcony.

00:00:39.536 --> 00:00:40.742
They were fantastic.

00:00:41.885 --> 00:00:43.060
He was a philosopher.

00:00:43.631 --> 00:00:44.801
He was a drum player.

00:00:44.825 --> 00:00:46.784
He was a teacher par excellence.

00:00:48.483 --> 00:00:51.140
Richard Feynman was also a showman,

00:00:51.164 --> 00:00:52.727
an enormous showman.

00:00:52.751 --> 00:00:55.186
He was brash, irreverent.

00:00:56.186 --> 00:01:00.976
He was full of macho,
a kind of macho one-upmanship.

00:01:01.455 --> 00:01:05.058
He loved intellectual battle.

00:01:05.405 --> 00:01:08.054
He had a gargantuan ego.

00:01:09.157 --> 00:01:12.633
But the man had, somehow,

00:01:12.657 --> 00:01:15.109
a lot of room at the bottom.

00:01:15.133 --> 00:01:19.863
And what I mean by that
is a lot of room, in my case --

00:01:19.887 --> 00:01:22.976
I can't speak for anybody else,
but in my case --

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.279
a lot of room for another big ego.

00:01:26.303 --> 00:01:27.693
Well, not as big as his,

00:01:27.717 --> 00:01:29.597
but fairly big.

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:32.779
I always felt good with Dick Feynman.

00:01:33.136 --> 00:01:35.110
It was always fun to be with him.

00:01:35.586 --> 00:01:37.348
He always made me feel smart.

00:01:37.753 --> 00:01:39.960
How can somebody like that
make you feel smart?

00:01:39.984 --> 00:01:41.150
Somehow he did.

00:01:41.174 --> 00:01:43.634
He made me feel smart.
He made me feel he was smart.

00:01:43.658 --> 00:01:45.609
He made me feel we were both smart,

00:01:45.633 --> 00:01:48.975
and the two of us could solve
any problem whatever.

00:01:50.083 --> 00:01:53.091
And in fact, we did sometimes
do physics together.

00:01:53.115 --> 00:01:55.160
We never published a paper together,

00:01:55.184 --> 00:01:56.644
but we did have a lot of fun.

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:59.976
He loved to win,

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:03.379
win these little macho games
we would sometimes play.

00:02:03.403 --> 00:02:06.667
And he didn't only play them with me,
but with all sorts of people.

00:02:06.691 --> 00:02:08.528
He would almost always win.

00:02:08.552 --> 00:02:11.615
But when he didn't win, when he lost,

00:02:11.639 --> 00:02:14.276
he would laugh and seem
to have just as much fun

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:15.498
as if he had won.

00:02:16.331 --> 00:02:18.479
I remember once he told me a story

00:02:18.503 --> 00:02:20.424
about a joke the students played on him.

00:02:20.892 --> 00:02:23.429
I think it was for his birthday --

00:02:23.453 --> 00:02:24.870
they took him for lunch

00:02:24.894 --> 00:02:29.512
to a sandwich place in Pasadena.

00:02:29.536 --> 00:02:31.171
It may still exist; I don't know.

00:02:31.584 --> 00:02:34.166
Celebrity sandwiches was their thing.

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:36.530
You could get a Marilyn Monroe sandwich.

00:02:36.554 --> 00:02:38.855
You could get a Humphrey Bogart sandwich.

00:02:39.373 --> 00:02:41.555
The students went there in advance,

00:02:41.579 --> 00:02:44.977
and arranged that they'd all order
Feynman sandwiches.

00:02:45.001 --> 00:02:47.988
One after another, they came in
and ordered Feynman sandwiches.

00:02:48.012 --> 00:02:49.240
Feynman loved this story.

00:02:49.264 --> 00:02:53.298
He told me this story,
and he was really happy and laughing.

00:02:53.322 --> 00:02:56.072
When he finished the story, I said to him,

00:02:56.096 --> 00:02:58.959
"Dick, I wonder what
would be the difference

00:02:58.983 --> 00:03:01.976
between a Feynman sandwich
and a Susskind sandwich."

00:03:02.491 --> 00:03:04.506
And without skipping a beat at all,

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:07.772
he said, "Well, they'd be about the same.

00:03:07.796 --> 00:03:11.118
The only difference is a Susskind
sandwich would have a lot more ham."

00:03:11.142 --> 00:03:12.827
"Ham" as in bad actor.

00:03:12.851 --> 00:03:14.375
(Laughter)

00:03:14.399 --> 00:03:17.809
Well, I happened to have been
very quick that day,

00:03:17.833 --> 00:03:19.976
and I said, "Yeah,
but a lot less baloney."

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.954
(Laughter)

00:03:22.978 --> 00:03:24.115
(Applause)

00:03:24.139 --> 00:03:27.321
The truth of the matter

00:03:27.345 --> 00:03:31.327
is that a Feynman sandwich
had a load of ham,

00:03:31.351 --> 00:03:34.130
but absolutely no baloney.

00:03:35.645 --> 00:03:37.918
What Feynman hated worse
than anything else

00:03:37.942 --> 00:03:39.944
was intellectual pretense --

00:03:39.968 --> 00:03:41.197
phoniness,

00:03:41.221 --> 00:03:43.648
false sophistication, jargon.

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:49.218
I remember sometime during the mid-'80s,

00:03:49.242 --> 00:03:53.376
Dick and I and Sidney Coleman
would meet a couple of times

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:56.565
up in San Francisco --
at some very rich guy's house --

00:03:56.589 --> 00:03:58.716
up in San Francisco for dinner.

00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:00.976
And the last time the rich guy invited us,

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.136
he also invited a couple of philosophers.

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:05.688
These guys were philosophers of mind.

00:04:05.712 --> 00:04:09.076
Their specialty was the philosophy
of consciousness.

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:11.790
And they were full of all kinds of jargon.

00:04:11.814 --> 00:04:14.210
I'm trying to remember the words --

00:04:14.234 --> 00:04:18.124
"monism," "dualism,"
categories all over the place.

00:04:18.148 --> 00:04:21.722
I didn't know what those meant, neither
did Dick or Sydney, for that matter.

00:04:21.746 --> 00:04:23.516
And what did we talk about?

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:26.115
Well, what do you talk about
when you talk about minds?

00:04:26.139 --> 00:04:28.303
There's one obvious thing to talk about:

00:04:28.327 --> 00:04:29.976
Can a machine become a mind?

00:04:30.578 --> 00:04:32.307
Can you build a machine

00:04:32.331 --> 00:04:35.413
that thinks like a human being
that is conscious?

00:04:35.841 --> 00:04:39.171
We sat around and talked about this --
we of course never resolved it.

00:04:39.195 --> 00:04:40.976
But the trouble with the philosophers

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:42.976
is that they were philosophizing

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.344
when they should have been
science-ophizing.

00:04:45.788 --> 00:04:48.128
It's a scientific question, after all.

00:04:48.152 --> 00:04:51.059
And this was a very, very
dangerous thing to do

00:04:51.083 --> 00:04:52.512
around Dick Feynman.

00:04:52.536 --> 00:04:54.020
(Laughter)

00:04:55.278 --> 00:04:58.473
Feynman let them have it --
both barrels, right between the eyes.

00:04:58.497 --> 00:05:01.568
It was brutal; it was funny --
ooh, it was funny.

00:05:01.592 --> 00:05:03.305
But it was really brutal.

00:05:03.329 --> 00:05:05.279
He really popped their balloon.

00:05:06.065 --> 00:05:09.565
But the amazing thing was --
Feynman had to leave a little early;

00:05:09.589 --> 00:05:12.691
he wasn't feeling too well,
so he left a little bit early.

00:05:12.715 --> 00:05:15.609
And Sidney and I were left there
with the two philosophers.

00:05:15.633 --> 00:05:18.623
And the amazing thing
is these guys were flying.

00:05:18.647 --> 00:05:20.463
They were so happy.

00:05:20.828 --> 00:05:23.082
They had met the great man;

00:05:23.106 --> 00:05:25.534
they had been instructed by the great man;

00:05:25.558 --> 00:05:27.499
they had an enormous amount of fun

00:05:27.523 --> 00:05:29.708
having their faces shoved in the mud ...

00:05:30.875 --> 00:05:33.334
And it was something special.

00:05:33.358 --> 00:05:36.747
I realized there was something
just extraordinary about Feynman,

00:05:36.771 --> 00:05:40.585
even when he did what he did.

00:05:43.414 --> 00:05:46.088
Dick -- he was my friend;
I did call him Dick --

00:05:46.112 --> 00:05:48.798
Dick and I had a little bit of a rapport.

00:05:48.822 --> 00:05:51.696
I think it may have been a special
rapport that he and I had.

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:54.343
We liked each other;
we liked the same kind of things.

00:05:54.367 --> 00:05:57.850
I also like the intellectual macho games.

00:05:58.278 --> 00:06:00.358
Sometimes I would win,
mostly he would win,

00:06:00.382 --> 00:06:01.976
but we both enjoyed them.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.390
And Dick became convinced at some point

00:06:04.414 --> 00:06:08.622
that he and I had
some kind of similarity of personality.

00:06:09.226 --> 00:06:10.680
I don't think he was right.

00:06:10.704 --> 00:06:12.923
I think the only point
of similarity between us

00:06:12.947 --> 00:06:15.145
is we both like to talk about ourselves.

00:06:15.169 --> 00:06:18.010
But he was convinced of this.

00:06:18.034 --> 00:06:21.088
And the man was incredibly curious.

00:06:21.112 --> 00:06:24.786
And he wanted to understand
what it was and why it was

00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:27.637
that there was this funny connection.

00:06:28.374 --> 00:06:30.058
And one day, we were walking.

00:06:30.082 --> 00:06:31.908
We were in France, in Les Houches.

00:06:31.932 --> 00:06:35.556
We were up in the mountains, 1976.

00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:39.838
And Feynman said to me, "Leonardo ..."

00:06:39.862 --> 00:06:42.897
The reason he called me "Leonardo"
is because we were in Europe,

00:06:42.921 --> 00:06:44.572
and he was practicing his French.

00:06:44.596 --> 00:06:46.716
(Laughter)

00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:49.963
And he said, "Leonardo,

00:06:49.987 --> 00:06:53.976
were you closer to your mother
or your father when you were a kid?"

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.976
I said, "Well, my real hero was my father.

00:06:58.057 --> 00:07:00.208
He was a working man,

00:07:00.232 --> 00:07:01.885
had a fifth-grade education.

00:07:02.375 --> 00:07:05.199
He was a master mechanic,
and he taught me how to use tools.

00:07:05.223 --> 00:07:09.191
He taught me all sorts of things
about mechanical things.

00:07:09.215 --> 00:07:11.246
He even taught me the Pythagorean theorem.

00:07:11.270 --> 00:07:13.223
He didn't call it the hypotenuse,

00:07:13.247 --> 00:07:15.315
he called it the shortcut distance."

00:07:15.855 --> 00:07:18.632
And Feynman's eyes just opened up.

00:07:18.656 --> 00:07:20.249
He went off like a lightbulb.

00:07:21.011 --> 00:07:23.092
And he said that he had had

00:07:23.116 --> 00:07:26.275
basically exactly the same
relationship with his father.

00:07:26.870 --> 00:07:30.290
In fact, he had been convinced at one time

00:07:30.314 --> 00:07:34.125
that to be a good physicist,

00:07:34.149 --> 00:07:37.482
it was very important to have had
that kind of relationship

00:07:37.506 --> 00:07:38.662
with your father.

00:07:38.686 --> 00:07:41.692
I apologize for the sexist
conversation here,

00:07:41.716 --> 00:07:43.576
but this is the way it really happened.

00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:47.397
He said he had been absolutely
convinced that this was necessary,

00:07:47.421 --> 00:07:51.060
a necessary part of the growing up
of a young physicist.

00:07:51.655 --> 00:07:54.788
Being Dick, he, of course,
wanted to check this.

00:07:54.812 --> 00:07:57.088
He wanted to go out and do an experiment.

00:07:57.112 --> 00:07:58.128
(Laughter)

00:07:58.152 --> 00:07:59.304
Well, he did.

00:07:59.328 --> 00:08:00.986
He went out and did an experiment.

00:08:01.010 --> 00:08:03.925
He asked all his friends
that he thought were good physicists,

00:08:03.949 --> 00:08:06.294
"Was it your mom or your pop
that influenced you?"

00:08:06.318 --> 00:08:08.281
They were all men,

00:08:08.305 --> 00:08:10.935
and to a man, every single
one of them said,

00:08:10.959 --> 00:08:12.183
"My mother."

00:08:12.207 --> 00:08:15.274
(Laughter)

00:08:15.298 --> 00:08:19.298
There went that theory,
down the trash can of history.

00:08:19.322 --> 00:08:20.426
(Laughter)

00:08:20.450 --> 00:08:23.252
But he was very excited
that he had finally met somebody

00:08:23.276 --> 00:08:26.872
who had the same experience
with his father

00:08:26.896 --> 00:08:28.331
as he had with his father.

00:08:28.355 --> 00:08:32.480
And for some time, he was convinced
this was the reason we got along so well.

00:08:32.504 --> 00:08:34.141
I don't know. Maybe. Who knows?

00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:38.392
But let me tell you a little bit
about Feynman the physicist.

00:08:40.622 --> 00:08:44.576
Feynman's style --
no, "style" is not the right word.

00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:47.445
"Style" makes you think
of the bow tie he might have worn,

00:08:47.469 --> 00:08:48.770
or the suit he was wearing.

00:08:48.794 --> 00:08:50.713
It's something much deeper than that,

00:08:50.737 --> 00:08:52.808
but I can't think of another word for it.

00:08:52.832 --> 00:08:58.274
Feynman's scientific style
was always to look for the simplest,

00:08:58.298 --> 00:09:02.213
most elementary solution
to a problem that was possible.

00:09:02.237 --> 00:09:05.762
If it wasn't possible,
you had to use something fancier.

00:09:06.469 --> 00:09:11.041
No doubt, part of this
was his great joy and pleasure

00:09:11.065 --> 00:09:14.497
in showing people that he could
think more simply than they could.

00:09:14.837 --> 00:09:17.996
But he also deeply believed,
he truly believed,

00:09:18.020 --> 00:09:20.260
that if you couldn't explain
something simply,

00:09:20.284 --> 00:09:21.815
you didn't understand it.

00:09:23.140 --> 00:09:26.393
In the 1950s, people
were trying to figure out

00:09:26.417 --> 00:09:28.393
how superfluid helium worked.

00:09:29.313 --> 00:09:30.489
There was a theory.

00:09:30.513 --> 00:09:32.924
It was due to a Russian
mathematical physicist.

00:09:32.948 --> 00:09:34.358
It was a complicated theory;

00:09:34.382 --> 00:09:36.493
I'll tell you what it was soon enough.

00:09:36.517 --> 00:09:38.365
It was a terribly complicated theory,

00:09:38.389 --> 00:09:41.226
full of very difficult
integrals and formulas

00:09:41.250 --> 00:09:43.075
and mathematics and so forth.

00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:46.837
And it sort of worked,
but it didn't work very well.

00:09:46.861 --> 00:09:48.203
The only way it worked

00:09:48.227 --> 00:09:51.446
is when the helium atoms
were very, very far apart.

00:09:51.470 --> 00:09:54.183
And unfortunately,

00:09:54.207 --> 00:09:57.365
the helium atoms in liquid helium
are right on top of each other.

00:09:57.389 --> 00:10:00.730
Feynman decided, as a sort
of amateur helium physicist,

00:10:00.754 --> 00:10:03.004
that he would try to figure it out.

00:10:03.028 --> 00:10:05.432
He had an idea, a very clear idea.

00:10:05.456 --> 00:10:06.850
He would try to figure out

00:10:06.874 --> 00:10:11.950
what the quantum wave function
of this huge number of atoms looked like.

00:10:11.974 --> 00:10:13.621
He would try to visualize it,

00:10:13.645 --> 00:10:16.576
guided by a small number
of simple principles.

00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:19.576
The small number of simple principles
were very, very simple.

00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:22.977
The first one was that when
helium atoms touch each other,

00:10:23.001 --> 00:10:24.309
they repel.

00:10:24.333 --> 00:10:27.731
The implication of that is that
the wave function has to go to zero,

00:10:27.755 --> 00:10:30.840
it has to vanish when the helium
atoms touch each other.

00:10:30.864 --> 00:10:33.173
The other fact
is that in the ground state --

00:10:33.197 --> 00:10:35.934
the lowest energy state
of a quantum system --

00:10:35.958 --> 00:10:39.229
the wave function is always very smooth;

00:10:39.253 --> 00:10:41.348
it has the minimum number of wiggles.

00:10:41.372 --> 00:10:42.900
So he sat down --

00:10:42.924 --> 00:10:45.195
and I imagine he had nothing more

00:10:45.219 --> 00:10:47.632
than a simple piece
of paper and a pencil --

00:10:47.656 --> 00:10:49.896
and he tried to write down,
and did write down,

00:10:49.920 --> 00:10:52.215
the simplest function
that he could think of,

00:10:52.239 --> 00:10:54.216
which had the boundary conditions

00:10:54.240 --> 00:10:56.704
that the wave function
vanish when things touch

00:10:56.728 --> 00:10:58.441
and is smooth in between.

00:10:59.233 --> 00:11:01.972
He wrote down a simple thing --
so simple, in fact,

00:11:01.996 --> 00:11:05.123
that I suspect a really smart
high-school student

00:11:05.147 --> 00:11:06.576
who didn't even have calculus

00:11:06.600 --> 00:11:08.533
could understand what he wrote down.

00:11:09.077 --> 00:11:12.226
The thing was, that simple thing
that he wrote down

00:11:12.250 --> 00:11:15.791
explained everything that was known
at the time about liquid helium,

00:11:15.815 --> 00:11:17.088
and then some.

00:11:17.504 --> 00:11:20.481
I've always wondered
whether the professionals --

00:11:20.505 --> 00:11:22.566
the real professional helium physicists --

00:11:22.590 --> 00:11:24.757
were just a little bit
embarrassed by this.

00:11:25.162 --> 00:11:27.831
They had their super-powerful technique,

00:11:27.855 --> 00:11:29.631
and they couldn't do as well.

00:11:29.655 --> 00:11:33.782
Incidentally, I'll tell you
what that super-powerful technique was.

00:11:33.806 --> 00:11:36.355
It was the technique of Feynman diagrams.

00:11:36.379 --> 00:11:38.236
(Laughter)

00:11:38.260 --> 00:11:41.014
He did it again in 1968.

00:11:41.521 --> 00:11:46.507
In 1968, in my own university --
I wasn't there at the time --

00:11:46.531 --> 00:11:49.103
they were exploring
the structure of the proton.

00:11:49.497 --> 00:11:53.113
The proton is obviously made
of a whole bunch of little particles;

00:11:53.137 --> 00:11:55.077
this was more or less known.

00:11:55.522 --> 00:11:58.858
And the way to analyze it was,
of course, Feynman diagrams.

00:11:58.882 --> 00:12:01.423
That's what Feynman diagrams
were constructed for --

00:12:01.447 --> 00:12:02.716
to understand particles.

00:12:03.234 --> 00:12:05.846
The experiments that were going on
were very simple:

00:12:05.870 --> 00:12:07.205
you simply take the proton,

00:12:07.229 --> 00:12:09.839
and you hit it really sharply
with an electron.

00:12:09.863 --> 00:12:12.554
This was the thing
the Feynman diagrams were for.

00:12:12.991 --> 00:12:17.054
The only problem was that
Feynman diagrams are complicated.

00:12:17.078 --> 00:12:18.618
They're difficult integrals.

00:12:18.642 --> 00:12:21.813
If you could do all of them,
you would have a very precise theory,

00:12:21.837 --> 00:12:24.414
but you couldn't --
they were just too complicated.

00:12:25.313 --> 00:12:26.774
People were trying to do them.

00:12:26.798 --> 00:12:29.718
You could do a one-loop diagram.
Don't worry about one loop.

00:12:29.742 --> 00:12:32.747
One loop, two loops --
maybe you could do a three-loop diagram,

00:12:32.771 --> 00:12:34.825
but beyond that, you couldn't do anything.

00:12:34.849 --> 00:12:36.493
Feynman said, "Forget all of that.

00:12:36.517 --> 00:12:37.988
Just think of the proton

00:12:38.012 --> 00:12:42.345
as an assemblage, a swarm,
of little particles."

00:12:42.369 --> 00:12:44.020
He called them "partons."

00:12:44.044 --> 00:12:49.747
He said, "Just think of it as a swarm
of partons moving real fast."

00:12:49.771 --> 00:12:51.858
Because they're moving real fast,

00:12:52.996 --> 00:12:57.098
relativity says the internal
motions go very slow.

00:12:57.821 --> 00:12:59.433
The electron hits it suddenly --

00:12:59.457 --> 00:13:03.514
it's like taking a very sudden
snapshot of the proton.

00:13:04.153 --> 00:13:05.308
What do you see?

00:13:05.332 --> 00:13:09.366
You see a frozen bunch of partons.

00:13:09.390 --> 00:13:10.572
They don't move,

00:13:10.596 --> 00:13:13.652
and because they don't move
during the course of the experiment,

00:13:13.676 --> 00:13:15.985
you don't have to worry
about how they're moving.

00:13:16.009 --> 00:13:18.615
You don't have to worry
about the forces between them.

00:13:18.639 --> 00:13:23.828
You just get to think of it
as a population of frozen partons."

00:13:24.314 --> 00:13:27.778
This was the key to analyzing
these experiments.

00:13:27.802 --> 00:13:30.576
Extremely effective.

00:13:30.987 --> 00:13:33.489
Somebody said the word
"revolution" is a bad word.

00:13:33.513 --> 00:13:35.654
I suppose it is,
so I won't say "revolution,"

00:13:35.678 --> 00:13:41.180
but it certainly evolved very, very deeply
our understanding of the proton,

00:13:41.204 --> 00:13:43.000
and of particles beyond that.

00:13:43.370 --> 00:13:45.988
Well, I had some more
that I was going to tell you

00:13:46.012 --> 00:13:47.669
about my connection with Feynman,

00:13:47.693 --> 00:13:48.867
what he was like,

00:13:48.891 --> 00:13:51.195
but I see I have exactly half a minute.

00:13:51.219 --> 00:13:55.146
So I think I'll just finish up by saying:

00:13:55.170 --> 00:13:57.966
I actually don't think
Feynman would have liked this event.

00:13:57.990 --> 00:14:02.279
I think he would have said,
"I don't need this."

00:14:02.882 --> 00:14:04.032
But ...

00:14:04.056 --> 00:14:05.064
(Laughter)

00:14:05.088 --> 00:14:06.446
How should we honor Feynman?

00:14:06.470 --> 00:14:08.152
How should we really honor Feynman?

00:14:08.176 --> 00:14:11.320
I think the answer
is we should honor Feynman

00:14:11.344 --> 00:14:15.306
by getting as much baloney
out of our own sandwiches

00:14:15.330 --> 00:14:16.576
as we can.

00:14:16.941 --> 00:14:18.092
Thank you.

00:14:18.116 --> 00:14:21.317
(Applause)
