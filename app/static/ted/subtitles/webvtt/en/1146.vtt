00:00:00.768 --> 00:00:02.397
Think about your day for a second.

00:00:02.421 --> 00:00:05.668
You woke up, felt fresh air on your face
as you walked out the door,

00:00:05.692 --> 00:00:08.143
encountered new colleagues
and had great discussions

00:00:08.167 --> 00:00:10.269
and felt in awe
when you found something new.

00:00:10.293 --> 00:00:12.971
But I bet there's something
you didn't think about today,

00:00:12.995 --> 00:00:14.291
something so close to home,

00:00:14.315 --> 00:00:16.754
you probably don't think
about it very often at all.

00:00:16.778 --> 00:00:20.041
And that's that all those sensations,
feelings, decisions and actions

00:00:20.065 --> 00:00:22.023
are mediated by the computer in your head

00:00:22.047 --> 00:00:23.237
called your brain.

00:00:23.261 --> 00:00:25.946
Now, the brain may not look
like much from the outside --

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:28.337
a couple pounds of pinkish-gray flesh,

00:00:28.361 --> 00:00:29.575
amorphous.

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:33.294
But the last 100 years of neuroscience
have allowed us to zoom in on the brain

00:00:33.318 --> 00:00:35.430
and to see the intricacy
of what lies within.

00:00:35.454 --> 00:00:39.218
And they've told us that this brain
is an incredibly complicated circuit

00:00:39.242 --> 00:00:42.877
made out of hundreds of billions
of cells called neurons.

00:00:42.901 --> 00:00:46.157
Now, unlike a human-designed computer,

00:00:46.181 --> 00:00:48.818
where there's a fairly small number
of different parts,

00:00:48.842 --> 00:00:51.695
and we know how they work
because we humans designed them,

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:54.790
the brain is made out of thousands
of different kinds of cells,

00:00:54.814 --> 00:00:55.976
maybe tens of thousands.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.345
They come in different shapes;
they're made out of different molecules;

00:00:59.369 --> 00:01:01.831
they project and connect
to different brain regions.

00:01:01.855 --> 00:01:04.853
They also change in different ways
in different disease states.

00:01:04.877 --> 00:01:06.253
Let's make it concrete.

00:01:06.277 --> 00:01:07.762
There's a class of cells,

00:01:07.786 --> 00:01:11.842
a fairly small cell, an inhibitory cell,
that quiets its neighbors.

00:01:11.866 --> 00:01:14.126
It's one of the cells
that seems to be atrophied

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:15.685
in disorders like schizophrenia.

00:01:15.709 --> 00:01:17.410
It's called the basket cell.

00:01:17.434 --> 00:01:19.968
And this cell is one
of the thousands of kinds of cell

00:01:19.992 --> 00:01:21.271
that we're learning about.

00:01:21.295 --> 00:01:23.271
New ones are being discovered every day.

00:01:24.222 --> 00:01:25.616
As just a second example:

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:29.622
these pyramidal cells, large cells,
can span a significant fraction

00:01:29.646 --> 00:01:30.797
of the brain.

00:01:30.821 --> 00:01:32.003
They're excitatory.

00:01:32.027 --> 00:01:34.740
And these are some of the cells
that might be overactive

00:01:34.764 --> 00:01:36.329
in disorders such as epilepsy.

00:01:37.055 --> 00:01:40.976
Every one of these cells
is an incredible electrical device.

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:44.137
They receive inputs
from thousands of upstream partners

00:01:44.161 --> 00:01:46.513
and compute their own electrical outputs,

00:01:46.537 --> 00:01:48.748
which then, if they pass
a certain threshold,

00:01:48.772 --> 00:01:50.857
will go to thousands
of downstream partners.

00:01:50.881 --> 00:01:53.621
And this process, which takes
just a millisecond or so,

00:01:53.645 --> 00:01:57.638
happens thousands of times a minute
in every one of your 100 billion cells,

00:01:57.662 --> 00:02:00.461
as long as you live and think and feel.

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:05.818
So how are we going to figure out
what this circuit does?

00:02:05.842 --> 00:02:07.833
Ideally, we could go through this circuit

00:02:07.857 --> 00:02:10.399
and turn these different
kinds of cell on and off

00:02:10.423 --> 00:02:12.117
and see whether we could figure out

00:02:12.141 --> 00:02:14.394
which ones contribute to certain functions

00:02:14.418 --> 00:02:16.923
and which ones go wrong
in certain pathologies.

00:02:16.947 --> 00:02:20.255
If we could activate cells, we could see
what powers they can unleash,

00:02:20.279 --> 00:02:21.969
what they can initiate and sustain.

00:02:21.993 --> 00:02:23.246
If we could turn them off,

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:26.112
then we could try and figure out
what they're necessary for.

00:02:26.136 --> 00:02:29.125
And that's the story
I'm going to tell you about today.

00:02:29.149 --> 00:02:32.058
And honestly, where we've gone
through over the last 11 years,

00:02:32.082 --> 00:02:33.568
through an attempt to find ways

00:02:33.592 --> 00:02:36.654
of turning circuits and cells
and parts and pathways of the brain

00:02:36.678 --> 00:02:37.829
on and off,

00:02:37.853 --> 00:02:39.436
both to understand the science

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:44.627
and also to confront some of the issues
that face us all as humans.

00:02:45.415 --> 00:02:47.799
Now, before I tell you
about the technology,

00:02:47.823 --> 00:02:51.948
the bad news is that a significant
fraction of us in this room,

00:02:51.972 --> 00:02:53.128
if we live long enough,

00:02:53.152 --> 00:02:55.220
will encounter, perhaps, a brain disorder.

00:02:55.898 --> 00:02:59.716
Already, a billion people
have had some kind of brain disorder

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:01.162
that incapacitates them.

00:03:01.186 --> 00:03:03.581
The numbers don't do it justice, though.

00:03:03.605 --> 00:03:05.929
These disorders --
schizophrenia, Alzheimer's,

00:03:05.953 --> 00:03:07.104
depression, addiction --

00:03:07.128 --> 00:03:09.299
they not only steal away our time to live,

00:03:09.323 --> 00:03:10.474
they change who we are.

00:03:10.498 --> 00:03:12.644
They take our identity
and change our emotions

00:03:12.668 --> 00:03:14.688
and change who we are as people.

00:03:15.454 --> 00:03:17.821
Now, in the 20th century,

00:03:19.116 --> 00:03:21.374
there was some hope that was generated

00:03:21.398 --> 00:03:25.011
through the development of pharmaceuticals
for treating brain disorders.

00:03:25.035 --> 00:03:27.272
And while many drugs have been developed

00:03:27.296 --> 00:03:29.885
that can alleviate symptoms
of brain disorders,

00:03:29.909 --> 00:03:32.499
practically none of them
can be considered to be cured.

00:03:32.523 --> 00:03:34.715
In part, that's because,
if you think about it,

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:36.662
we're bathing the brain in a chemical --

00:03:36.686 --> 00:03:40.046
this elaborate circuit, made of thousands
of different kinds of cell --

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:41.561
is being bathed in a substance.

00:03:41.585 --> 00:03:44.299
That's also why most of the drugs,
not all, on the market

00:03:44.323 --> 00:03:46.807
can present some kind
of serious side effect too.

00:03:46.831 --> 00:03:50.663
Now some people have gotten some solace
from electrical stimulators

00:03:50.687 --> 00:03:52.224
that are implanted in the brain,

00:03:52.248 --> 00:03:55.751
for Parkinson's disease
or cochlear implants.

00:03:55.775 --> 00:03:59.545
These have indeed been able
to bring some kind of remedy

00:03:59.569 --> 00:04:01.631
to people with certain kinds of disorders.

00:04:01.655 --> 00:04:04.682
But electricity also will go
in all directions --

00:04:04.706 --> 00:04:06.190
the path of least resistance --

00:04:06.214 --> 00:04:08.462
which is where that phrase,
in part, comes from,

00:04:08.486 --> 00:04:10.251
and will also affect normal circuits,

00:04:10.275 --> 00:04:12.403
as well as the abnormal ones
you want to fix.

00:04:12.427 --> 00:04:15.390
So again, we're sent back to the idea
of ultraprecise control:

00:04:15.414 --> 00:04:18.414
Could we dial in information
precisely where we want it to go?

00:04:20.069 --> 00:04:23.170
So, when I started
in neuroscience 11 years ago --

00:04:23.194 --> 00:04:26.430
I had trained as an electrical
engineer and a physicist --

00:04:26.454 --> 00:04:28.184
the first thing I thought about was,

00:04:28.208 --> 00:04:30.297
if these neurons are electrical devices,

00:04:30.321 --> 00:04:34.120
all we need to do is to find some way
of driving those electrical changes

00:04:34.144 --> 00:04:35.304
at a distance.

00:04:35.328 --> 00:04:38.643
If we could turn on the electricity
in one cell but not its neighbors,

00:04:38.667 --> 00:04:42.013
that'd give us the tool to activate
and shut down these different cells

00:04:42.037 --> 00:04:43.278
to figure out what they do

00:04:43.302 --> 00:04:46.404
and how they contribute
to the networks in which they're embedded.

00:04:46.428 --> 00:04:49.393
It would also allow us to have
the ultraprecise control we need

00:04:49.417 --> 00:04:51.878
to fix the circuit computations
that have gone awry.

00:04:52.577 --> 00:04:54.198
Now, how are we going to do that?

00:04:54.222 --> 00:04:56.782
Well, there are many molecules
that exist in nature

00:04:56.806 --> 00:04:59.999
which are able to convert
light into electricity.

00:05:00.023 --> 00:05:03.234
You can think of them as little proteins
that are like solar cells.

00:05:03.258 --> 00:05:06.055
If we install these molecules
in neurons somehow,

00:05:06.079 --> 00:05:09.415
then these neurons would become
electrically drivable with light,

00:05:09.439 --> 00:05:12.587
and their neighbors, which don't have
this molecule, would not.

00:05:12.611 --> 00:05:15.381
There's one other magic trick you need
to make this happen:

00:05:15.405 --> 00:05:17.313
the ability to get light into the brain.

00:05:17.337 --> 00:05:19.837
The brain doesn't feel pain.

00:05:19.861 --> 00:05:21.496
Taking advantage of all the effort

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:24.217
that's gone into the internet,
telecommunications, etc.,

00:05:24.241 --> 00:05:26.400
you can put optical fibers
connected to lasers

00:05:26.424 --> 00:05:30.445
to activate -- in animal models,
for example, in preclinical studies --

00:05:30.469 --> 00:05:32.296
these neurons and see what they do.

00:05:32.875 --> 00:05:34.152
So how do we do this?

00:05:34.708 --> 00:05:38.342
Around 2004, in collaboration
with Georg Nagel and Karl Deisseroth,

00:05:38.366 --> 00:05:40.307
this vision came to fruition.

00:05:40.683 --> 00:05:43.713
There's a certain alga
that swims in the wild,

00:05:43.737 --> 00:05:47.609
and it needs to navigate towards light
in order to photosynthesize optimally.

00:05:47.633 --> 00:05:49.685
And it senses light with a little eyespot,

00:05:49.709 --> 00:05:51.929
which works not unlike how our eye works.

00:05:52.421 --> 00:05:54.708
In its membrane, or its boundary,

00:05:54.732 --> 00:05:57.072
it contains little proteins

00:05:57.934 --> 00:06:00.416
that indeed can convert
light into electricity.

00:06:00.858 --> 00:06:03.408
These molecules are called
channelrhodopsins.

00:06:03.432 --> 00:06:06.210
And each of these proteins
acts just like that solar cell

00:06:06.234 --> 00:06:07.399
that I told you about.

00:06:07.423 --> 00:06:08.574
When blue light hits it,

00:06:08.598 --> 00:06:12.048
it opens a little hole and allows
charged particles to enter the eyespot;

00:06:12.072 --> 00:06:14.613
that allows this eyespot
to have an electrical signal,

00:06:14.637 --> 00:06:16.643
just like a solar cell charging a battery.

00:06:16.667 --> 00:06:18.798
So what we need to do
is take these molecules

00:06:18.822 --> 00:06:20.549
and somehow install them in neurons.

00:06:20.573 --> 00:06:21.917
And because it's a protein,

00:06:21.941 --> 00:06:24.993
it's encoded for
in the DNA of this organism.

00:06:25.017 --> 00:06:27.162
So all we've got to do is take that DNA,

00:06:27.186 --> 00:06:30.060
put it into a gene therapy
vector, like a virus,

00:06:30.084 --> 00:06:31.417
and put it into neurons.

00:06:33.016 --> 00:06:36.691
And this was a very productive time
in gene therapy,

00:06:36.715 --> 00:06:38.707
and lots of viruses were coming along,

00:06:38.731 --> 00:06:40.614
so this turned out to be fairly simple.

00:06:40.638 --> 00:06:43.097
Early in the morning
one day in the summer of 2004,

00:06:43.121 --> 00:06:45.420
we gave it a try,
and it worked on the first try.

00:06:45.797 --> 00:06:47.921
You take this DNA
and put it into the neuron.

00:06:47.945 --> 00:06:51.330
The neuron uses its natural
protein-making machinery

00:06:51.354 --> 00:06:53.810
to fabricate these little
light-sensitive proteins

00:06:53.834 --> 00:06:57.583
and install them all over the cell,
like putting solar panels on a roof.

00:06:57.607 --> 00:06:58.952
And the next thing you know,

00:06:58.976 --> 00:07:01.448
you have a neuron
which can be activated with light.

00:07:02.043 --> 00:07:03.481
So this is very powerful.

00:07:03.505 --> 00:07:07.216
One of the tricks you have to do
is figure out how to deliver these genes

00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:09.771
to the cells you want
and not all the other neighbors.

00:07:09.795 --> 00:07:10.946
And you can do that;

00:07:10.970 --> 00:07:13.974
you can tweak the viruses
so they hit some cells and not others.

00:07:13.998 --> 00:07:16.128
And there's other genetic
tricks you can play

00:07:16.152 --> 00:07:18.479
in order to get light-activated cells.

00:07:18.946 --> 00:07:21.926
This field has now come to be known
as "optogenetics."

00:07:21.950 --> 00:07:24.851
And just as one example
of the kind of thing you can do,

00:07:24.875 --> 00:07:26.648
you can take a complex network,

00:07:26.672 --> 00:07:28.741
use one of these viruses
to deliver the gene

00:07:28.765 --> 00:07:31.007
just to one kind of cell
in this dense network.

00:07:31.031 --> 00:07:33.579
And then when you shine light
on the entire network,

00:07:33.603 --> 00:07:35.443
just that cell type will be activated.

00:07:35.467 --> 00:07:38.774
For example, let's consider
that basket cell I told you about earlier,

00:07:38.798 --> 00:07:40.773
the one that's atrophied in schizophrenia

00:07:40.797 --> 00:07:42.333
and the one that is inhibitory.

00:07:43.031 --> 00:07:45.139
If we can deliver that gene
to these cells --

00:07:45.163 --> 00:07:48.221
they won't be altered by the expression
of the gene, of course --

00:07:48.245 --> 00:07:50.688
then flash blue light
over the entire brain network,

00:07:50.712 --> 00:07:52.851
just these cells are going to be driven.

00:07:52.875 --> 00:07:55.708
And when the light turns off,
these cells go back to normal;

00:07:55.732 --> 00:07:57.558
there don't seem to be adverse events.

00:07:57.582 --> 00:07:59.588
Not only can you study
what these cells do,

00:07:59.612 --> 00:08:01.759
what their power
is in computing in the brain,

00:08:01.783 --> 00:08:03.844
you can also use this to try to figure out

00:08:03.868 --> 00:08:06.078
if we could jazz up
the activity of these cells

00:08:06.102 --> 00:08:07.555
if indeed, they're atrophied.

00:08:07.579 --> 00:08:10.647
I want to tell you some short stories
about how we're using this

00:08:10.671 --> 00:08:14.057
both at the scientific clinical
and preclinical levels.

00:08:14.081 --> 00:08:16.511
One of the questions
that we've confronted is:

00:08:16.535 --> 00:08:19.277
What signals in the brain
mediate the sensation of reward?

00:08:19.301 --> 00:08:20.837
Because if you could find those,

00:08:20.861 --> 00:08:23.747
those would be some of the signals
that could drive learning;

00:08:23.771 --> 00:08:25.967
the brain will do more
of what got that reward.

00:08:25.991 --> 00:08:29.142
These are also signals that go awry
in disorders such as addiction.

00:08:29.166 --> 00:08:32.852
So if we could figure out what cells
they are, we could maybe find new targets

00:08:32.876 --> 00:08:35.366
for which drugs can be
designed or screened against

00:08:35.390 --> 00:08:37.641
or maybe places
where electrodes could be put in

00:08:37.665 --> 00:08:39.490
for people who have severe disability.

00:08:39.514 --> 00:08:41.902
To do that, we came up with
a very simple paradigm

00:08:41.926 --> 00:08:43.887
in collaboration with the Fiorillo group,

00:08:43.911 --> 00:08:46.600
where, if the animal goes
to one side of this little box,

00:08:46.624 --> 00:08:47.820
it gets a pulse of light.

00:08:47.844 --> 00:08:50.824
And we'll make different cells
in the brain sensitive to light.

00:08:50.848 --> 00:08:54.435
If these cells can mediate reward,
the animal should go there more and more.

00:08:54.459 --> 00:08:55.624
And that's what happens.

00:08:55.648 --> 00:08:58.606
The animal goes to the right-hand side
and pokes his nose there

00:08:58.630 --> 00:09:01.119
and gets a flash of blue light
every time he does it.

00:09:01.143 --> 00:09:02.676
He'll do that hundreds of times.

00:09:02.700 --> 00:09:04.177
These are the dopamine neurons,

00:09:04.201 --> 00:09:06.302
in some of the pleasure
centers in the brain.

00:09:06.326 --> 00:09:10.119
We've shown that a brief activation
of these is enough to drive learning.

00:09:10.143 --> 00:09:12.188
Now we can generalize the idea.

00:09:12.212 --> 00:09:15.845
Instead of one point in the brain,
we can devise devices that span the brain,

00:09:15.869 --> 00:09:18.545
that can deliver light
into three-dimensional patterns --

00:09:18.569 --> 00:09:19.762
arrays of optical fibers,

00:09:19.786 --> 00:09:22.561
each coupled to its own independent
miniature light source.

00:09:22.585 --> 00:09:24.302
Then we can try to do things in vivo

00:09:24.326 --> 00:09:26.340
that have only been done
to date in a dish,

00:09:26.364 --> 00:09:29.096
like high-throughput screening
throughout the entire brain

00:09:29.120 --> 00:09:31.741
for the signals that can cause
certain things to happen

00:09:31.765 --> 00:09:34.986
or that could be good clinical targets
for treating brain disorders.

00:09:35.010 --> 00:09:36.831
One story I want to tell you about is:

00:09:36.855 --> 00:09:40.069
How can we find targets for treating
post-traumatic stress disorder,

00:09:40.093 --> 00:09:42.760
a form of uncontrolled anxiety and fear?

00:09:42.784 --> 00:09:47.676
One of the things that we did was to adopt
a very classical model of fear.

00:09:47.700 --> 00:09:50.677
This goes back to the Pavlovian days.

00:09:50.701 --> 00:09:54.379
It's called Pavlovian fear conditioning,
where a tone ends with a brief shock.

00:09:54.403 --> 00:09:56.847
The shock isn't painful,
but it's a little annoying.

00:09:56.871 --> 00:09:58.749
And over time -- in this case, a mouse,

00:09:58.773 --> 00:10:01.883
which is a good animal model,
commonly used in such experiments --

00:10:01.907 --> 00:10:03.587
the animal learns to fear the tone.

00:10:03.611 --> 00:10:06.678
It will react by freezing,
sort of like a deer in the headlights.

00:10:06.702 --> 00:10:09.432
Now the question is: What targets
in the brain can we find

00:10:09.456 --> 00:10:12.082
that allow us to overcome this fear?

00:10:12.106 --> 00:10:15.851
So we play that tone again,
after it's been associated with fear.

00:10:15.875 --> 00:10:18.071
But we activate
different targets in the brain,

00:10:18.095 --> 00:10:21.077
using that optical fiber array
I showed on the previous slide,

00:10:21.101 --> 00:10:22.534
in order to try and figure out

00:10:22.558 --> 00:10:25.828
which targets can cause the brain
to overcome that memory of fear.

00:10:25.852 --> 00:10:28.142
This brief video shows you
one of these targets

00:10:28.166 --> 00:10:29.420
that we're working on now.

00:10:29.444 --> 00:10:33.081
This is an area in the prefrontal cortex,
a region where we can use cognition

00:10:33.105 --> 00:10:35.209
to try to overcome
aversive emotional states.

00:10:35.233 --> 00:10:37.526
The animal hears a tone.
A flash of light occurs.

00:10:37.550 --> 00:10:40.178
There's no audio, but you see
that the animal freezes --

00:10:40.202 --> 00:10:41.681
the tone used to mean bad news.

00:10:41.705 --> 00:10:44.188
There's a little clock
in the lower left-hand corner.

00:10:44.212 --> 00:10:46.742
You can see the animal
is about two minutes into this.

00:10:46.766 --> 00:10:48.980
This next clip
is just eight minutes later.

00:10:49.004 --> 00:10:52.528
And the same tone is going to play,
and the light is going to flash again.

00:10:53.034 --> 00:10:56.210
OK, there it goes. Right ... now.

00:10:56.234 --> 00:10:58.924
And now you can see,
just 10 minutes into the experiment,

00:10:58.948 --> 00:11:01.768
that we've equipped the brain,
by photoactivating this area,

00:11:01.792 --> 00:11:04.897
to overcome the expression
of this fear memory.

00:11:06.002 --> 00:11:09.030
Over the last couple years,
we've gone back to the tree of life,

00:11:09.054 --> 00:11:12.151
because we wanted to find ways
to turn circuits in the brain off.

00:11:12.175 --> 00:11:14.715
If we could do that,
this could be extremely powerful.

00:11:14.739 --> 00:11:17.464
If you can delete cells
for a few milliseconds or seconds,

00:11:17.488 --> 00:11:21.298
you can figure out what role they play
in the circuits in which they're embedded.

00:11:21.322 --> 00:11:23.898
We surveyed organisms
from all over the tree of life --

00:11:23.922 --> 00:11:26.883
every kingdom of life but animals;
we see slightly differently.

00:11:26.907 --> 00:11:29.776
We found molecules called
halorhodopsins or archaerhodopsins,

00:11:29.800 --> 00:11:31.666
that respond to green and yellow light.

00:11:31.690 --> 00:11:34.793
And they do the opposite
of the molecule I told you about before,

00:11:34.817 --> 00:11:37.302
with the blue light activator,
channelrhodopsin.

00:11:37.326 --> 00:11:40.153
Let's give an example
of where we think this is going to go.

00:11:40.177 --> 00:11:42.975
Consider, for example,
a condition like epilepsy,

00:11:42.999 --> 00:11:45.089
where the brain is overactive.

00:11:45.113 --> 00:11:47.228
Now, if drugs fail in epileptic treatment,

00:11:47.252 --> 00:11:49.737
one of the strategies
is to remove part of the brain,

00:11:49.761 --> 00:11:52.444
but that's irreversible,
and there could be side effects.

00:11:52.468 --> 00:11:55.754
What if we could just turn off that brain
for the brief amount of time

00:11:55.778 --> 00:11:57.158
until the seizure dies away,

00:11:57.182 --> 00:12:00.596
and cause the brain to be restored
to its initial state,

00:12:00.620 --> 00:12:03.926
like a dynamical system that's being
coaxed down into a stable state?

00:12:03.950 --> 00:12:06.012
This animation tries
to explain this concept

00:12:06.036 --> 00:12:09.223
where we made these cells sensitive
to being turned off with light,

00:12:09.247 --> 00:12:10.399
and we beam light in,

00:12:10.423 --> 00:12:12.951
and just for the time it takes
to shut down a seizure,

00:12:12.975 --> 00:12:14.846
we're hoping to be able to turn it off.

00:12:14.870 --> 00:12:16.982
We don't have data
to show you on this front,

00:12:17.006 --> 00:12:18.642
but we're very excited about this.

00:12:18.666 --> 00:12:22.088
I want to close on one story,
which we think is another possibility,

00:12:22.112 --> 00:12:25.505
which is that maybe these molecules,
if you can do ultraprecise control,

00:12:25.529 --> 00:12:28.582
can be used in the brain itself
to make a new kind of prosthetic,

00:12:28.606 --> 00:12:29.758
an optical prosthetic.

00:12:29.782 --> 00:12:32.911
I already told you that electrical
stimulators are not uncommon.

00:12:32.935 --> 00:12:34.279
Seventy-five thousand people

00:12:34.303 --> 00:12:36.651
have Parkinson's deep-brain
stimulators implanted,

00:12:36.675 --> 00:12:40.268
maybe 100,000 people have cochlear
implants, which allow them to hear.

00:12:40.292 --> 00:12:43.076
Another thing -- you've got
to get these genes into cells.

00:12:43.100 --> 00:12:45.344
A new hope in gene therapy
has been developed,

00:12:45.368 --> 00:12:47.977
because viruses like
the adeno-associated virus --

00:12:48.001 --> 00:12:50.248
which probably most of us
around this room have;

00:12:50.272 --> 00:12:51.764
it doesn't have any symptoms --

00:12:51.788 --> 00:12:53.602
have been used in hundreds of patients

00:12:53.626 --> 00:12:55.685
to deliver genes
into the brain or the body.

00:12:55.709 --> 00:12:58.242
And so far, there have not been
serious adverse events

00:12:58.266 --> 00:12:59.509
associated with the virus.

00:12:59.533 --> 00:13:02.505
There's one last elephant
in the room: the proteins themselves,

00:13:02.529 --> 00:13:04.632
which come from algae,
bacteria and funguses

00:13:04.656 --> 00:13:06.332
and all over the tree of life.

00:13:06.356 --> 00:13:08.888
Most of us don't have funguses
or algae in our brains,

00:13:08.912 --> 00:13:10.965
so what will our brain do
if we put that in?

00:13:10.989 --> 00:13:13.659
Will the cells tolerate it?
Will the immune system react?

00:13:13.683 --> 00:13:16.208
It's early -- these haven't
been done in humans yet --

00:13:16.232 --> 00:13:18.962
but we're working on a variety
of studies to examine this.

00:13:18.986 --> 00:13:21.834
So far, we haven't seen
overt reactions of any severity

00:13:21.858 --> 00:13:23.128
to these molecules

00:13:23.152 --> 00:13:26.716
or to the illumination
of the brain with light.

00:13:26.740 --> 00:13:29.851
So it's early days, to be upfront,
but we're excited about it.

00:13:29.875 --> 00:13:31.492
I wanted to close with one story,

00:13:31.516 --> 00:13:34.745
which we think could potentially
be a clinical application.

00:13:35.653 --> 00:13:38.128
Now, there are many forms of blindness

00:13:38.152 --> 00:13:41.388
where the photoreceptors --
light sensors in the back of our eye --

00:13:41.412 --> 00:13:42.571
are gone.

00:13:42.595 --> 00:13:44.437
And the retina is a complex structure.

00:13:44.461 --> 00:13:47.123
Let's zoom in on it
so we can see it in more detail.

00:13:47.147 --> 00:13:49.545
The photoreceptor cells
are shown here at the top.

00:13:49.569 --> 00:13:52.731
The signals that are detected
by the photoreceptors are transformed

00:13:52.755 --> 00:13:53.910
via various computations

00:13:53.934 --> 00:13:57.178
until finally, the layer of cells
at the bottom, the ganglion cells,

00:13:57.202 --> 00:13:58.891
relay the information to the brain,

00:13:58.915 --> 00:14:00.479
where we see that as perception.

00:14:01.058 --> 00:14:03.545
In many forms of blindness,
like retinitis pigmentosa

00:14:03.569 --> 00:14:05.275
or macular degeneration,

00:14:05.299 --> 00:14:08.074
the photoreceptor cells
have atrophied or been destroyed.

00:14:08.644 --> 00:14:10.503
Now, how could you repair this?

00:14:10.527 --> 00:14:13.541
It's not even clear that a drug
could cause this to be restored,

00:14:13.565 --> 00:14:15.710
since there's nothing
for the drug to bind to.

00:14:15.734 --> 00:14:18.168
On the other hand,
light can still get into the eye.

00:14:18.192 --> 00:14:20.731
The eye is still transparent
and you can get light in.

00:14:20.755 --> 00:14:23.949
So what if we could take these
channelrhodopsins and other molecules

00:14:23.973 --> 00:14:26.406
and install them
on some of these other spared cells

00:14:26.430 --> 00:14:28.201
and convert them into little cameras?

00:14:28.225 --> 00:14:30.899
And because there are so many
of these cells in the eye,

00:14:30.923 --> 00:14:33.559
potentially, they could be
very high-resolution cameras.

00:14:33.583 --> 00:14:35.257
This is some work that we're doing,

00:14:35.281 --> 00:14:38.295
led by one of our collaborators,
Alan Horsager at USC,

00:14:38.319 --> 00:14:41.994
and being sought to be commercialized
by a start-up company, Eos Neuroscience,

00:14:42.018 --> 00:14:43.310
which is funded by the NIH.

00:14:43.334 --> 00:14:46.378
What you see here is a mouse
trying to solve a six-arm maze.

00:14:46.402 --> 00:14:50.038
There's a bit of water to motivate
the mouse to move or he'll just sit there.

00:14:50.062 --> 00:14:52.321
The goal of this maze
is to get out of the water

00:14:52.345 --> 00:14:55.380
and go to a little platform
that's under the lit top port.

00:14:56.078 --> 00:14:58.654
Mice are smart, so this one
solves the maze eventually,

00:14:58.678 --> 00:15:00.254
but he does a brute-force search.

00:15:00.278 --> 00:15:03.576
He's swimming down every avenue
until he finally gets to the platform.

00:15:03.600 --> 00:15:05.684
He's not using vision to do it.

00:15:05.708 --> 00:15:07.767
These different mice
are different mutations

00:15:07.791 --> 00:15:10.894
that recapitulate different kinds
of blindness that affect humans.

00:15:10.918 --> 00:15:14.025
So we're being careful in trying
to look at these different models

00:15:14.049 --> 00:15:16.150
so we come up with a generalized approach.

00:15:16.590 --> 00:15:17.851
So how can we solve this?

00:15:17.875 --> 00:15:20.504
We'll do exactly what we outlined
in the previous slide.

00:15:20.528 --> 00:15:22.488
We'll take these blue light photo sensors

00:15:22.512 --> 00:15:24.330
and install them onto a layer of cells

00:15:24.354 --> 00:15:26.697
in the middle of the retina
in the back of the eye

00:15:26.721 --> 00:15:28.345
and convert them into a camera --

00:15:28.369 --> 00:15:30.955
just like installing solar cells
all over those neurons

00:15:30.979 --> 00:15:32.375
to make them light-sensitive.

00:15:32.399 --> 00:15:34.693
Light is converted to electricity on them.

00:15:34.717 --> 00:15:37.611
So this mouse was blind
a couple weeks before this experiment

00:15:37.635 --> 00:15:40.843
and received one dose of this
photosensitive molecule on a virus.

00:15:40.867 --> 00:15:43.409
And now you can see,
the animal can indeed avoid walls

00:15:43.433 --> 00:15:44.874
and go to this little platform

00:15:44.898 --> 00:15:48.095
and make cognitive use of its eyes again.

00:15:48.119 --> 00:15:49.852
And to point out the power of this:

00:15:49.876 --> 00:15:51.700
these animals can get to that platform

00:15:51.724 --> 00:15:54.449
just as fast as animals
that have seen their entire lives.

00:15:54.473 --> 00:15:56.623
So this preclinical study,
I think, bodes hope

00:15:56.647 --> 00:15:59.417
for the kinds of things
we're hoping to do in the future.

00:16:00.295 --> 00:16:04.788
We're also exploring new business models
for this new field of neurotechnology.

00:16:04.812 --> 00:16:06.963
We're developing tools
and sharing them freely

00:16:06.987 --> 00:16:09.040
with hundreds of groups all over the world

00:16:09.064 --> 00:16:11.644
for them to study and try
to treat different disorders.

00:16:11.668 --> 00:16:13.921
Our hope is that
by figuring out brain circuits

00:16:13.945 --> 00:16:17.192
at a level of abstraction that lets us
repair them and engineer them,

00:16:17.216 --> 00:16:20.413
we can take some of these intractable
disorders I mentioned earlier,

00:16:20.437 --> 00:16:22.156
practically none of which are cured,

00:16:22.180 --> 00:16:24.202
and in the 21st century,
make them history.

00:16:24.226 --> 00:16:25.387
Thank you.

00:16:25.411 --> 00:16:31.581
(Applause)

00:16:38.707 --> 00:16:41.367
Juan Enriquez: So some of this stuff
is a little dense.

00:16:41.391 --> 00:16:43.367
(Laughter)

00:16:43.823 --> 00:16:48.431
But the implications of being able
to control seizures or epilepsy

00:16:48.455 --> 00:16:50.432
with light instead of drugs

00:16:50.456 --> 00:16:53.110
and being able to target
those specifically

00:16:53.134 --> 00:16:54.650
is a first step.

00:16:55.382 --> 00:16:57.526
The second thing
that I think I heard you say

00:16:57.550 --> 00:17:02.378
is you can now control
the brain in two colors,

00:17:02.402 --> 00:17:03.663
like an on-off switch.

00:17:03.687 --> 00:17:04.851
Ed Boyden: That's right.

00:17:04.875 --> 00:17:08.088
JE: Which makes every impulse going
through the brain a binary code.

00:17:08.112 --> 00:17:09.263
EB: Right.

00:17:09.287 --> 00:17:12.739
With blue light, we can drive information,
and it's in the form of a one.

00:17:12.763 --> 00:17:15.207
And by turning things off,
it's more or less a zero.

00:17:15.231 --> 00:17:18.780
Our hope is to eventually build brain
coprocessors that work with the brain

00:17:18.804 --> 00:17:21.450
so we can augment functions
in people with disabilities.

00:17:21.474 --> 00:17:27.029
JE: And in theory, that means that,
as a mouse feels, smells, hears, touches,

00:17:27.053 --> 00:17:30.374
you can model it out
as a string of ones and zeros.

00:17:30.398 --> 00:17:32.938
EB: Yeah. We're hoping
to use this as a way of testing

00:17:32.962 --> 00:17:35.084
what neural codes
can drive certain behaviors

00:17:35.108 --> 00:17:37.091
and certain thoughts and certain feelings

00:17:37.115 --> 00:17:39.629
and use that to understand
more about the brain.

00:17:39.653 --> 00:17:42.485
JE: Does that mean that someday
you could download memories

00:17:42.509 --> 00:17:44.164
and maybe upload them?

00:17:44.188 --> 00:17:46.871
EB: That's something we're starting
to work on very hard.

00:17:46.895 --> 00:17:50.449
We're now working on trying to tile
the brain with recording elements, too,

00:17:50.473 --> 00:17:53.579
so we can record information
and then drive information back in --

00:17:53.603 --> 00:17:55.416
sort of computing what the brain needs

00:17:55.440 --> 00:17:57.646
in order to augment
its information processing.

00:17:57.670 --> 00:18:00.247
JE: Well, that might change
a couple things. Thank you.

00:18:00.271 --> 00:18:01.422
EB: Thank you.

00:18:01.446 --> 00:18:03.984
(Applause)
