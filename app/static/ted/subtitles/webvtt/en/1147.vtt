00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Hello, my name is Thomas Heatherwick.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
I have a studio in London

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
that has a particular approach

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
to designing buildings.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
When I was growing up,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
I was exposed to making

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
and crafts and materials

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
and invention on a small scale.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
And I was there looking

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
at the larger scale of buildings

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
and finding

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
that the buildings that were around me

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
and that were being designed

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
and that were there in the publications I was seeing

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
felt soulless and cold.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
And there on the smaller scale,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
the scale of an earring

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
or a ceramic pot

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
or a musical instrument,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
was a materiality and a soulfulness.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
And this influenced me.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
The first building I built was 20 years ago.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
And since, in the last 20 years,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
I've developed a studio in London.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
Sorry, this was my mother, by the way,

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
in her bead shop in London.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
I spent a lot of time counting beads and things like that.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
I'm just going to show, for people who don't know my studio's work,

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
a few projects that we've worked on.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
This is a hospital building.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
This is a shop for a bag company.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
This is studios for artists.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
This is a sculpture

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
made from a million yards of wire

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
and 150,000 glass beads

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
the size of a golf ball.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
And this is a window display.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
And this is pair of cooling towers

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
for an electricity substation

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
next to St. Paul's Cathedral in London.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
And this is a temple in Japan

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
for a Buddhist monk.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
And this is a cafe by the sea

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
in Britain.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
And just very quickly,

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
something we've been working on very recently

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
is we were commissioned by the mayor of London

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
to design a new bus

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
that gave the passenger

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
their freedom again.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
Because the original Routemaster bus

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
that some of you may be familiar with,

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
which had this open platform at the back --

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
in fact, I think all our Routemasters

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
are here in California now actually.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
But they aren't in London.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
And so you're stuck on a bus.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
And if the bus is going to stop

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
and it's three yards away from the bus stop,

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
you're just a prisoner.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
But the mayor of London wanted to reintroduce

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
buses with this open platform.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.000
So we've been working with Transport for London,

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
and that organization

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
hasn't actually been responsible

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
as a client for a new bus

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
for 50 years.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
And so we've been very lucky to have a chance to work.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
The brief is that the bus should use 40 percent less energy.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
So it's got hybrid drive.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
And we've been working

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000
to try to improve

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000
everything from the fabric

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000
to the format

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
and structure

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
and aesthetics.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000
I was going to show four main projects.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000
And this is a project for a bridge.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000
And so we were commissioned to design a bridge that would open.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000
And openings seemed --

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
everyone loves opening bridges,

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000
but it's quite a basic thing.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000
I think we all kind of stand and watch.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
But the bridges that we saw

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.000
that opened and closed --

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.000
I'm slightly squeamish --

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.000
but I once saw a photograph of a footballer

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000
who was diving for a ball.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.000
And as he was diving, someone had stamped on his knee,

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.000
and it had broken like this.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.000
And then we looked at these kinds of bridges

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000
and just couldn't help feeling

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.000
that it was a beautiful thing that had broken.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000
And so this is in Paddington in London.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000
And it's a very boring bridge, as you can see.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000
It's just steel and timber.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000
But instead of what it is,

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.000
our focus was on the way it worked.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:27.000
(Applause)

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000
So we liked the idea that the two farthest bits of it

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000
would end up kissing each other.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:43.000
(Applause)

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000
We actually had to halve its speed,

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000
because everyone was too scared when we first did it.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000
So that's it speeded up.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.000
A project that we've been working on very recently

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.000
is to design a new biomass power station --

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:59.000
so a power station that uses organic waste material.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000
In the news,

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000
the subject of where our future water is going to come from

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000
and where our power is going to come from

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.000
is in all the papers all the time.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.000
And we used to be quite proud of the way we generated power.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000
But recently,

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.000
any annual report of a power company

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000
doesn't have a power station on it.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000
It has a child running through a field, or something like that.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000
(Laughter)

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:27.000
And so when a consortium of engineers approached us

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000
and asked us to work with them on this power station,

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000
our condition was that we would work with them

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.000
and that, whatever we did,

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:39.000
we were not just going to decorate a normal power station.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.000
And instead, we had to learn -- we kind of forced them to teach us.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.000
And so we spent time traveling with them

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000
and learning about all the different elements,

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.000
and finding that there were plenty of inefficiencies

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000
that weren't being capitalized on.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.000
That just taking a field and banging all these things out

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.000
isn't necessarily the most efficient way that they could work.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:02.000
So we looked at how we could compose all those elements --

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.000
instead of just litter, create one composition.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000
And what we found --

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.000
this area is one of the poorest parts of Britain.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.000
It was voted the worst place in Britain to live.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000
And there are 2,000 new homes being built

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.000
next to this power station.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.000
So it felt this has a social dimension.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.000
It has a symbolic importance.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.000
And we should be proud of where our power is coming from,

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.000
rather than something we are necessarily ashamed of.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000
So we were looking at how we could make a power station,

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000
that, instead of keeping people out

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.000
and having a big fence around the outside,

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.000
could be a place that pulls you in.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.000
And it has to be --

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.000
I'm trying to get my --

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:43.000
250 feet high.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:46.000
So it felt that what we could try to do

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.000
is make a power park

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.000
and actually bring the whole area in,

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.000
and using the spare soil that's there on the site,

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000
we could make a power station that was silent as well.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.000
Because just that soil

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.000
could make the acoustic difference.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.000
And we also found that we could make a more efficient structure

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000
and have a cost-effective way

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.000
of making a structure to do this.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.000
The finished project

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.000
is meant to be more than just a power station.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.000
It has a space where you could have a bar mitzvah at the top.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000
(Laughter)

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:19.000
And it's a power park.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.000
So people can come and really experience this

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.000
and also look out all around the area,

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.000
and use that height that we have to have for its function.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000
In Shanghai,

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000
we were invited to build --

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.000
well we weren't invited; what am I talking about.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:36.000
We won the competition, and it was painful to get there.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:40.000
(Laughter)

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.000
So we won the competition to build the U.K. pavilion.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.000
And an expo

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.000
is a totally bonkers thing.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:50.000
There's 250 pavilions.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:54.000
It's the world's biggest ever expo that had ever happened.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.000
So there are up to a million people there everyday.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.000
And 250 countries all competing.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.000
And the British government saying,

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.000
"You need to be in the top five."

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.000
And so that became

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:08.000
the governmental goal --

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:11.000
is, how do you stand out in this chaos,

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:15.000
which is an expo of stimulus?

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:19.000
So our sense was we had to do one thing,

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:22.000
and only one thing,

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.000
instead of trying to have everything.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000
And so what we also felt

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:29.000
was that whatever we did we couldn't do a cheesy advert for Britain.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000
(Laughter)

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.000
But the thing that was true,

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.000
the expo was about the future of cities,

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.000
and particularly the Victorians

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:40.000
pioneered integrating nature into the cities.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000
And the world's first public park of modern times

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.000
was in Britain.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:47.000
And the world's first major botanical institution

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.000
is in London,

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000
and they have this extraordinary project

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.000
where they've been collecting 25 percent

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.000
of all the world's plant species.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:58.000
So we suddenly realized that there was this thing.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:01.000
And everyone agrees that trees are beautiful,

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.000
and I've never met anyone who says, "I don't like trees."

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.000
And the same with flowers.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:08.000
I've never met anyone who says, "I don't like flowers."

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.000
But we realized that seeds --

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.000
there's been this very serious project happening --

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.000
but that seeds --

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.000
at these major botanical gardens,

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.000
seeds aren't on show.

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.000
But you just have to go to a garden center,

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.000
and they're in little paper packets.

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:25.000
But this phenomenal project's been happening.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.000
So we realized we had to make a project

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:30.000
that would be seeds, some kind of seed cathedral.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:33.000
But how could we show these teeny-weeny things?

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:36.000
And the film "Jurassic Park" actually really helped us.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.000
Because the DNA of the dinosaur that was trapped in the amber

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:42.000
gave us some kind of clue

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:44.000
that these tiny things

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.000
could be trapped and be made to seem precious,

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:49.000
rather than looking like nuts.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.000
So the challenge was,

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:54.000
how are we going to bring light and expose these things?

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:57.000
We didn't want to make a separate building and have separate content.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.000
So we were trying to think,

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:02.000
how could we make a whole thing emanate.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.000
By the way, we had half the budget of the other Western nations.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:07.000
So that was also in the mix

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.000
with the site the size of a football pitch.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:12.000
And so there was one particular toy that gave us a clue.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:15.000
(Video) Voice Over: The new Play-Doh Mop Top Hair Shop.

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:18.000
Song: ♫ We've got the Mop Tops, the Play-Doh Mop Tops ♫

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.000
♫ Just turn the chair and grow Play-Doh hair ♫

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.000
♫ They're the Mop Tops ♫

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.000
Thomas Heatherwick: Okay, you get the idea.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.000
So the idea

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.000
was to take these 66,000 seeds

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.000
that they agreed to give us,

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.000
and to take each seed and trap it

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:35.000
in this precious optical hair

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:38.000
and grow that through this box,

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.000
very simple box element,

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:43.000
and make it a building

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.000
that could move in the wind.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:48.000
So the whole thing can gently move when the wind blows.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.000
And inside, the daylight --

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.000
each one is an optic

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:54.000
and it brings light into the center.

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.000
And by night,

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.000
artificial light in each one

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.000
emanates and comes out to the outside.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:03.000
And to make the project affordable,

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:05.000
we focused our energy.

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:07.000
Instead of building a building as big as the football pitch,

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:10.000
we focused it on this one element.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:13.000
And the government agreed to do that

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.000
and not do anything else,

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.000
and focus our energy on that.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:20.000
And so the rest of the site was a public space.

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.000
And with a million people there a day,

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:25.000
it just felt like offering some public space.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:28.000
We worked with an AstroTurf manufacturer

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.000
to develop a mini-me version

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.000
of the seed cathedral,

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.000
so that, even if you're partially-sighted,

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:37.000
that it was kind of crunchy and soft,

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:40.000
that piece of landscape that you see there.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:44.000
And then, you know when a pet has an operation

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:46.000
and they shave a bit of the skin

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.000
and get rid of the fur --

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:51.000
in order to get you to go into the seed cathedral,

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.000
in effect, we've shaved it.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.000
And inside there's nothing;

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:57.000
there's no famous actor's voice;

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.000
there's no projections;

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.000
there's no televisions; there's no color changing.

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.000
There's just silence

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:06.000
and a cool temperature.

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.000
And if a cloud goes past,

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.000
you can see a cloud on the tips

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:13.000
where it's letting the light through.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.000
This is the only project that we've done

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.000
where the finished thing

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:23.000
looked more like a rendering than our renderings.

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:27.000
(Laughter)

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:32.000
A key thing was how people would interact.

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.000
I mean, in a way it was the most serious thing

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.000
you could possible do at the expo.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.000
And I just wanted to show you.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.000
The British government --

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:43.000
any government is potentially the worst client in the world

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:46.000
you could ever possibly want to have.

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:49.000
And there was a lot of terror.

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:52.000
But there was an underlying support.

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:55.000
And so there was a moment

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.000
when suddenly -- actually, the next thing.

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:00.000
This is the head of U.K. Trade and Investment,

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:03.000
who was our client,

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:07.000
with the Chinese children, using the landscape.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:10.000
(Video) Children: One, two, three, go.

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:19.000
(Laughter)

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:21.000
TH: I'm sorry about my stupid voice there.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.000
(Laughter)

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:26.000
So finally, texture is something.

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:29.000
In the projects we've been working on,

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:31.000
these slick buildings,

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:34.000
where they might be a fancy shape,

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:36.000
but the materiality feels the same,

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:40.000
is something that we've been trying to research really,

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:43.000
and explore alternatives.

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:46.000
And the project that we're building in Malaysia

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.000
is apartment buildings

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.000
for a property developer.

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.000
And it's in a piece of land

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:54.000
that's this site.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.000
And the mayor of Kuala Lumpur

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:58.000
said that, if this developer

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:01.000
would give something that gave something back to the city,

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:04.000
they would give them more gross floor area, buildable.

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:06.000
So there was an incentive for the developer

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:08.000
to really try to think about

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:10.000
what would be better for the city.

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:12.000
And the conventional thing with apartment buildings

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:14.000
in this part of the world

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.000
is you have your tower,

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:19.000
and you squeeze a few trees around the edge,

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:21.000
and you see cars parked.

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:24.000
It's actually only the first couple of floors that you really experience,

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:27.000
and the rest of it is just for postcards.

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:30.000
The lowest value is actually the bottom part of a tower like this.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.000
So if we could chop that away

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.000
and give the building a small bottom,

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:37.000
we could take that bit and put it at the top

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:40.000
where the greater commercial value is for a property developer.

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.000
And by linking these together,

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:45.000
we could have 90 percent of the site

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:47.000
as a rainforest,

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:49.000
instead of only 10 percent of scrubby trees

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:51.000
and bits of road around buildings.

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:55.000
(Applause)

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:58.000
So we're building these buildings.

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:01.000
They're actually identical, so it's quite cost-effective.

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.000
They're just chopped at different heights.

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:05.000
But the key part

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:08.000
is trying to give back an extraordinary piece of landscape,

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:12.000
rather than engulf it.

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:16.000
And that's my final slide.

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:18.000
Thank you.

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.000
(Applause)

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:22.000
Thank you.

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:32.000
(Applause)

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:34.000
June Cohen: So thank you. Thank you, Thomas. You're a delight.

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:37.000
Since we have an extra minute here,

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:40.000
I thought perhaps you could tell us a little bit about these seeds,

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:44.000
which maybe came from the shaved bit of the building.

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:46.000
TH: These are a few of the tests we did

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:48.000
when we were building the structure.

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:51.000
So there were 66,000 of these.

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:53.000
This optic

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:55.000
was 22 feet long.

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:58.000
And so the daylight was just coming --

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:01.000
it was caught on the outside of the box

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:04.000
and was coming down to illuminate each seed.

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:07.000
Waterproofing the building was a bit crazy.

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:10.000
Because it's quite hard to waterproof buildings anyway,

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:14.000
but if you say you're going to drill 66,000 holes in it --

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:19.000
we had quite a time.

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:21.000
There was one person in the contractors who was the right size --

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:23.000
and it wasn't a child --

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:25.000
who could fit between them

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:27.000
for the final waterproofing of the building.

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:29.000
JC: Thank you, Thomas.

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:31.000
(Applause)
