WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
I'm a pediatrician and an anesthesiologist,

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
so I put children to sleep for a living.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
(Laughter)

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
And I'm an academic, so I put audiences to sleep for free.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
(Laughter)

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
But what I actually mostly do

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
is I manage the pain management service

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
at the Packard Children's Hospital up at Stanford in Palo Alto.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
And it's from the experience

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
from about 20 or 25 years of doing that

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
that I want to bring to you the message this morning,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
that pain is a disease.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Now most of the time,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
you think of pain as a symptom of a disease,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
and that's true most of the time.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
It's the symptom of a tumor or an infection

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
or an inflammation or an operation.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
But about 10 percent of the time,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
after the patient has recovered from one of those events,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
pain persists.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
It persists for months

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
and oftentimes for years,

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
and when that happens,

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
it is its own disease.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
And before I tell you about how it is that we think that happens

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
and what we can do about it,

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
I want to show you how it feels for my patients.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
So imagine, if you will,

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
that I'm stroking your arm with this feather,

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
as I'm stroking my arm right now.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
Now, I want you to imagine

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
that I'm stroking it with this.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
Please keep your seat.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
(Laughter)

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
A very different feeling.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
Now what does it have to do with chronic pain?

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
Imagine, if you will, these two ideas together.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
Imagine what your life would be like

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
if I were to stroke it with this feather,

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
but your brain was telling you

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
that this is what you are feeling --

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
and that is the experience of my patients with chronic pain.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
In fact, imagine something even worse.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
Imagine I were to stroke your child's arm with this feather,

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
and their brain [was] telling them

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
that they were feeling this hot torch.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
That was the experience of my patient, Chandler,

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
whom you see in the photograph.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
As you can see, she's a beautiful, young woman.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
She was 16 years old last year when I met her,

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
and she aspired to be a professional dancer.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
And during the course of one of her dance rehearsals,

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
she fell on her outstretched arm and sprained her wrist.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
Now you would probably imagine, as she did,

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
that a wrist sprain is a trivial event

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
in a person's life.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
Wrap it in an ACE bandage,

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
take some ibuprofen for a week or two,

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
and that's the end of the story.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
But in Chandler's case, that was the beginning of the story.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
This is what her arm looked like

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
when she came to my clinic about three months after her sprain.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
You can see that the arm is discolored,

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
purplish in color.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
It was cadaverically cold to the touch.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
The muscles were frozen, paralyzed --

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000
dystonic is how we refer to that.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000
The pain had spread from her wrist to her hands,

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000
to her fingertips, from her wrist up to her elbow,

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
almost all the way to her shoulder.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
But the worst part was,

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000
not the spontaneous pain that was there 24 hours a day.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
The worst part was that she had allodynia,

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
the medical term for the phenomenon that I just illustrated

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
with the feather and with the torch.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
The lightest touch of her arm --

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
the touch of a hand,

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
the touch even of a sleeve, of a garment, as she put it on --

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.000
caused excruciating, burning pain.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000
How can the nervous system get this so wrong?

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000
How can the nervous system

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
misinterpret an innocent sensation

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
like the touch of a hand

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000
and turn it into the malevolent sensation

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
of the touch of the flame?

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000
Well you probably imagine that the nervous system in the body

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
is hardwired like your house.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
In your house, wires run in the wall,

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.000
from the light switch to a junction box in the ceiling

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.000
and from the junction box to the light bulb.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000
And when you turn the switch on, the light goes on.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000
And when you turn the switch off, the light goes off.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.000
So people imagine the nervous system is just like that.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000
If you hit your thumb with a hammer,

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000
these wires in your arm -- that, of course, we call nerves --

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.000
transmit the information into the junction box in the spinal cord

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000
where new wires, new nerves,

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000
take the information up to the brain

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.000
where you become consciously aware that your thumb is now hurt.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
But the situation, of course, in the human body

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.000
is far more complicated than that.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000
Instead of it being the case

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000
that that junction box in the spinal cord

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.000
is just simple where one nerve connects with the next nerve

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000
by releasing these little brown packets

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.000
of chemical information called neurotransmitters

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.000
in a linear one-on-one fashion,

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000
in fact, what happens

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000
is the neurotransmitters spill out in three dimensions --

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.000
laterally, vertically, up and down in the spinal cord --

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
and they start interacting

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000
with other adjacent cells.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000
These cells, called glial cells,

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000
were once thought to be

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000
unimportant structural elements of the spinal cord

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000
that did nothing more than hold all the important things together,

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000
like the nerves.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000
But it turns out

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000
the glial cells have a vital role

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000
in the modulation, amplification

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.000
and, in the case of pain, the distortion

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.000
of sensory experiences.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000
These glial cells become activated.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000
Their DNA starts to synthesize new proteins,

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000
which spill out

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000
and interact with adjacent nerves,

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.000
and they start releasing their neurotransmitters,

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000
and those neurotransmitters spill out

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000
and activate adjacent glial cells, and so on and so forth,

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000
until what we have

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000
is a positive feedback loop.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000
It's almost as if somebody came into your home

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000
and rewired your walls

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000
so that the next time you turned on the light switch,

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000
the toilet flushed three doors down,

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000
or your dishwasher went on,

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000
or your computer monitor turned off.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000
That's crazy,

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000
but that's, in fact, what happens

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000
with chronic pain.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.000
And that's why pain becomes its own disease.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000
The nervous system has plasticity.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.000
It changes, and it morphs

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000
in response to stimuli.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000
Well, what do we do about that?

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.000
What can we do in a case like Chandler's?

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000
We treat these patients in a rather crude fashion

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.000
at this point in time.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.000
We treat them with symptom-modifying drugs --

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.000
painkillers --

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000
which are, frankly, not very effective

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000
for this kind of pain.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000
We take nerves that are noisy and active

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000
that should be quiet,

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.000
and we put them to sleep with local anesthetics.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.000
And most importantly, what we do

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:11.000
is we use a rigorous, and often uncomfortable, process

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.000
of physical therapy and occupational therapy

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.000
to retrain the nerves in the nervous system

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.000
to respond normally

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.000
to the activities and sensory experiences

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.000
that are part of everyday life.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000
And we support all of that

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.000
with an intensive psychotherapy program

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.000
to address the despondency, despair and depression

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.000
that always accompanies

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.000
severe, chronic pain.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000
It's successful,

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.000
as you can see from this video of Chandler,

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.000
who, two months after we first met her,

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.000
is now doings a back flip.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000
And I had lunch with her yesterday

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.000
because she's a college student studying dance at Long Beach here,

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.000
and she's doing absolutely fantastic.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:56.000
But the future is actually even brighter.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.000
The future holds the promise

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000
that new drugs will be developed

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:04.000
that are not symptom-modifying drugs

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.000
that simply mask the problem,

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.000
as we have now,

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:11.000
but that will be disease-modifying drugs

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.000
that will actually go right to the root of the problem

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000
and attack those glial cells,

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.000
or those pernicious proteins

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.000
that the glial cells elaborate,

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:23.000
that spill over and cause this central nervous system wind-up,

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.000
or plasticity,

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.000
that so is capable

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000
of distorting and amplifying

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000
the sensory experience that we call pain.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.000
So I have hope

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.000
that in the future,

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.000
the prophetic words of George Carlin will be realized,

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.000
who said, "My philosophy:

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.000
No pain, no pain."

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.000
Thank you very much.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:52.000
(Applause)
