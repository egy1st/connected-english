00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
So I want to take you on a trip

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
to an alien world.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
And it's not a trip

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
that requires light-years of travel,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
but it's to a place

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
where it's defined by light.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
So it's a little-appreciated fact

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.000
that most of the animals in our ocean

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
make light.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
I've spent most of my career

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
studying this phenomenon called bioluminescence.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
I study it because I think understanding it

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
is critical to understanding life in the ocean

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
where most bioluminescence occurs.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
I also use it as a tool

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
for visualizing and tracking pollution.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
But mostly I'm entranced by it.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
Since my my first dive in a deep-diving submersible,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
when I went down and turned out the lights

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
and saw the fireworks displays,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
I've been a bioluminescence junky.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
But I would come back from those dives

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
and try to share the experience with words,

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000
and they were totally inadequate to the task.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
I needed some way to share the experience directly.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
And the first time I figured out that way

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
was in this little single-person submersible

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
called Deep Rover.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
This next video clip,

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
you're going to see how we stimulated the bioluminescence.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
And the first thing you're going to see

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
is a transect screen

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
that is about a meter across.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
(Video) Narrator: In front of the sub,

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
a mess screen will come into contact

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
with the soft-bodied creatures of the deep sea.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
With the sub's lights switched off,

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
it is possible to see their bioluminescence --

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
the light produced when they collide with the mesh.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
This is the first time

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
it has ever been recorded.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
Edith Widder: So I recorded that with an intensified video camera

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
that has about the sensitivity

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
of the fully dark-adapted human eye.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
Which means that really is what you would see

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
if you took a dive in a submersible.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
But just to try to prove that fact to you,

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
I've brought along some bioluminescent plankton

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
in what is undoubtedly a foolhardy attempt

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
at a live demonstration.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
(Laughter)

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
So, if we could have the lights down

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
and have it as dark in here as possible,

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
I have a flask

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
that has bioluminescent plankton in it.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000
And you'll note there's no light coming from them right now,

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
either because they're dead --

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
(Laughter)

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
or because I need to stir them up in some way

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.000
for you to see what bioluminescence really looks like.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000
(Gasps)

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000
Oops. Sorry.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:03:01.000
(Laughter)

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000
I spend most of my time working in the dark; I'm used to that.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
Okay.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
So that light

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000
was made by a bioluminescent dinoflagellate,

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000
a single-celled alga.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
So why would a single-celled alga

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
need to be able to produce light?

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000
Well, it uses it to defend itself from its predators.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000
The flash is like a scream for help.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.000
It's what's known as a bioluminescent burglar alarm,

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.000
and just like the alarm on your car or your house,

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.000
it's meant to cast unwanted attention onto the intruder,

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.000
thereby either leading to his capture

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000
or scaring him away.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000
There's a lot of animals that use this trick,

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000
for example this black dragonfish.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000
It's got a light organ under its eye.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000
It's got a chin barbel.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000
It's got a lot of other light organs you can't see, but you'll see in here in a minute.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:51.000
So we had to chase this in the submersible for quite sometime,

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000
because the top speed of this fish is one knot,

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000
which was the top speed of the submersible.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000
But it was worth it,

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000
because we caught it in a special capture device,

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
brought it up into the lab on the ship,

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.000
and then everything on this fish lights up.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000
It's unbelievable.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000
The light organs under the eyes are flashing.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000
That chin barbel is flashing.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000
It's got light organs on its belly that are flashing,

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000
fin lights.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000
It's a scream for help; it's meant to attract attention.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000
It's phenomenal.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000
And you normally don't get to see this

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.000
because we've exhausted the luminescence when we bring them up in nets.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.000
There's other ways you can defend yourself with light.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000
For example, this shrimp

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.000
releases its bioluminescent chemicals into the water

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.000
just the way a squid or an octopus would release an ink cloud.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.000
This blinds or distracts the predator.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.000
This little squid is called the fire shooter

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000
because of its ability to do this.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000
Now it may look like a tasty morsel,

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000
or a pig's head with wings --

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.000
(Laughter)

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.000
but if it's attacked,

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.000
it puts out a barrage of light --

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.000
in fact, a barrage of photon torpedoes.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000
I just barely got the lights out in time

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000
for you to be able to see those gobs of light

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000
hitting the transect screen

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000
and then just glowing.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000
It's phenomenal.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000
So there's a lot of animals in the open ocean --

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000
most of them that make light.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000
And we have a pretty good idea, for most of them, why.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.000
They use it for finding food, for attracting mates,

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000
for defending against predators.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000
But when you get down to the bottom of the ocean,

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.000
that's where things get really strange.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.000
And some of these animals

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.000
are probably inspiration for the things you saw in "Avatar,"

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.000
but you don't have to travel to Pandora to see them.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000
They're things like this.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000
This is a golden coral, a bush.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000
It grows very slowly.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000
In fact, it's thought that some of these

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.000
are as much as 3,000 years old,

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:53.000
which is one reason that bottom trawling should not be allowed.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:57.000
The other reason is this amazing bush glows.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.000
So if you brush up against it,

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000
any place you brushed against it,

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.000
you get this twinkling blue-green light

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.000
that's just breathtaking.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.000
And you see things like this.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.000
This looks like something out of a Dr. Seuss book --

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:15.000
just all manner of creatures all over this thing.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.000
And these are flytrap anemones.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.000
Now if you poke it, it pulls in its tentacles.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.000
But if you keep poking it,

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.000
it starts to produce light.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:30.000
And it actually ends up looking like a galaxy.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000
It produces these strings of light,

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.000
presumably as some form of defense.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.000
There are starfish that can make light.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.000
And there are brittle stars that produce bands of light

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.000
that dance along their arms.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.000
This looks like a plant,

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.000
but it's actually an animal.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.000
And it anchors itself in the sand

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.000
by blowing up a balloon on the end of its stock.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000
So it can actually hold itself in very strong currents,

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.000
as you see here.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.000
But if we collect it very gently, and we bring it up into the lab

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.000
and just squeeze it at the base of the stock,

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.000
it produces this light

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.000
that propagates from stem to the plume,

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:10.000
changing color as it goes,

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.000
from green to blue.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000
Colorization and sound effects

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.000
added for you viewing pleasure.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.000
(Laughter)

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.000
But we have no idea why it does that.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.000
Here's another one. This is also a sea pen.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.000
It's got a brittle star hitching a ride.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000
It's a green saber of light.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000
And like the one you just saw,

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.000
it can produce these as bands of light.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.000
So if I squeeze the base,

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.000
the bands go from base to tip.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.000
If I squeeze the tip, they go from tip to base.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.000
So what do you think happens if you squeeze it in the middle?

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:52.000
(Gasps)

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:55.000
I'd be very interested in your theories about what that's about.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.000
(Laughter)

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.000
So there's a language of light in the deep ocean,

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:02.000
and we're just beginning to understand it,

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000
and one way we're going about that

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.000
is we're imitating a lot of these displays.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.000
This is an optical lure that I've used.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.000
We call it the electronic jellyfish.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000
It's just 16 blue LEDs

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.000
that we can program to do different types of displays.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:17.000
And we view it with a camera system I developed called Eye-in-the-Sea

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.000
that uses far red light that's invisible to most animals,

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.000
so it's unobtrusive.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.000
So I just want to show you

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.000
some of the responses we've elicited

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.000
from animals in the deep sea.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.000
So the camera's black and white.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000
It's not high-resolution.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.000
And what you're seeing here is a bait box

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.000
with a bunch of -- like the cockroaches of the ocean --

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.000
there are isopods all over it.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.000
And right in the front

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000
is the electronic jellyfish.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.000
And when it starts flashing,

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:47.000
it's just going to be one of the LEDs that's flashing very fast.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.000
But as soon as it starts to flash --

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000
and it's going to look big, because it blooms on the camera --

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.000
I want you to look right here.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:56.000
There's something small there that responds.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.000
We're talking to something.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:02.000
It looks like a little of string pearls basically --

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:05.000
in fact, three strings of pearls.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.000
And this was very consistent.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.000
This was in the Bahamas at about 2,000 feet.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.000
We basically have a chat room going on here,

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.000
because once it gets started, everybody's talking.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.000
And I think this is actually a shrimp

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:20.000
that's releasing its bioluminescent chemicals into the water.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.000
But the cool thing is, we're talking to it.

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:25.000
We don't know what we're saying.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.000
Personally, I think it's something sexy.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.000
(Laughter)

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.000
And then finally,

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.000
I want to show you some responses that we recorded

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:36.000
with the world's first deep-sea webcam,

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.000
which we had installed in Monterey Canyon last year.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:41.000
We've only just begun to analyze all of this data.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:44.000
This is going to be a glowing source first,

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.000
which is like bioluminescent bacteria.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.000
And it is an optical cue

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:51.000
that there's carrion on the bottom of the ocean.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:54.000
So this scavenger comes in,

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.000
which is a giant sixgill shark.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.000
And I can't claim for sure

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:01.000
that the optical source brought it in, because there's bait right there.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.000
But if it had been following the odor plume,

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.000
it would have come in from the other direction.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.000
And it does actually seem to be trying

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:10.000
to eat the electronic jellyfish.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:14.000
That's a 12-foot-long giant sixgill shark.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:17.000
Okay, so this next one is from the webcam,

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:20.000
and it's going to be this pinwheel display.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:23.000
And this is a burglar alarm.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.000
And that was a Humboldt squid,

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:28.000
a juvenile Humboldt squid, about three feet long.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:31.000
This is at 3,000 feet in Monterey Canyon.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:34.000
But if it's a burglar alarm, you wouldn't expect it to attack the jellyfish directly.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:37.000
It's supposed to be attacking what's attacking the jellyfish.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:40.000
But we did see a bunch of responses like this.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:43.000
This guy is a little more contemplative.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.000
"Hey, wait a minute.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.000
There's supposed to be something else there."

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:50.000
He's thinking about it.

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.000
But he's persistent.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:54.000
He keeps coming back.

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.000
And then he goes away for a few seconds

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.000
to think about it some more,

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.000
and thinks,

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:03.000
"Maybe if I come in from a different angle."

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:07.000
(Laughter)

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.000
Nope.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:12.000
So we are starting to get a handle on this,

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.000
but only just the beginnings.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.000
We need more eyes on the process.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:19.000
So if any of you ever get a chance to take a dive in a submersible,

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:22.000
by all means, climb in and take the plunge.

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:25.000
This is something that should be on everybody's bucket list,

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:29.000
because we live on an ocean planet.

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.000
More than 90 percent, 99 percent,

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:34.000
of the living space on our planet

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.000
is ocean.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:40.000
It's a magical place

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:43.000
filled with breathtaking light shows

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:52.000
and bizarre and wondrous creatures,

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.000
alien life forms

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:57.000
that you don't have to travel to another planet to see.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:00.000
But if you do take the plunge,

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:03.000
please remember to turn out the lights.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:06.000
But I warn you,

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:09.000
it's addictive.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:17.000
Thank you.

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:24.000
(Applause)
