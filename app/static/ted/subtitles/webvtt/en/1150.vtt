00:00:00.516 --> 00:00:02.483
I'm used to thinking of the TED audience

00:00:02.507 --> 00:00:05.191
as a wonderful collection
of some of the most effective,

00:00:05.215 --> 00:00:07.976
intelligent, intellectual, savvy,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.094
worldly and innovative
people in the world.

00:00:10.118 --> 00:00:11.635
And I think that's true.

00:00:11.659 --> 00:00:16.419
However, I also have reason to believe
that many, if not most, of you

00:00:16.443 --> 00:00:18.872
are actually tying your shoes incorrectly.

00:00:18.896 --> 00:00:19.976
(Laughter)

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.932
Now I know that seems ludicrous.

00:00:22.956 --> 00:00:24.419
I know that seems ludicrous.

00:00:24.443 --> 00:00:28.139
And believe me, I lived the same sad life
until about three years ago.

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.147
And what happened to me

00:00:30.171 --> 00:00:33.575
was I bought, what was for me,
a very expensive pair of shoes.

00:00:33.599 --> 00:00:36.515
But those shoes came
with round nylon laces,

00:00:36.539 --> 00:00:37.976
and I couldn't keep them tied.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.356
So I went back to the store
and said to the owner,

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:42.594
"I love the shoes, but I hate the laces."

00:00:42.618 --> 00:00:45.342
He took a look and said,
"Oh, you're tying them wrong."

00:00:45.969 --> 00:00:47.557
Now up until that moment,

00:00:47.581 --> 00:00:50.239
I would have thought that, by age 50,

00:00:50.263 --> 00:00:53.370
one of the life skills
that I had really nailed

00:00:53.394 --> 00:00:54.609
was tying my shoes.

00:00:54.633 --> 00:00:55.634
(Laughter)

00:00:55.658 --> 00:00:57.856
But not so -- let me demonstrate.

00:00:59.872 --> 00:01:01.865
This is the way

00:01:01.889 --> 00:01:04.889
that most of us
were taught to tie our shoes.

00:01:07.657 --> 00:01:09.516
Now as it turns out -- thank you.

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:10.665
(Applause)

00:01:10.689 --> 00:01:12.449
Wait, there's more.

00:01:12.473 --> 00:01:13.951
As it turns out --

00:01:13.975 --> 00:01:14.976
(Laughter)

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.088
there's a strong form
and a weak form of this knot,

00:01:18.112 --> 00:01:19.697
and we were taught the weak form.

00:01:19.721 --> 00:01:20.976
And here's how to tell.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.691
If you pull the strands
at the base of the knot,

00:01:23.715 --> 00:01:25.976
you will see that the bow
will orient itself

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.976
down the long axis of the shoe.

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:30.258
That's the weak form of the knot.

00:01:30.282 --> 00:01:31.425
But not to worry.

00:01:32.472 --> 00:01:34.464
If we start over

00:01:34.488 --> 00:01:38.922
and simply go the other direction
around the bow,

00:01:38.946 --> 00:01:41.930
we get this, the strong form of the knot.

00:01:41.954 --> 00:01:44.095
And if you pull the cords under the knot,

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:46.841
you will see that the bow orients itself

00:01:46.865 --> 00:01:48.896
along the transverse axis of the shoe.

00:01:49.373 --> 00:01:50.944
This is a stronger knot.

00:01:50.968 --> 00:01:52.960
It will come untied less often.

00:01:52.984 --> 00:01:56.818
It will let you down less,
and not only that, it looks better.

00:01:57.588 --> 00:01:59.413
We're going to do this one more time.

00:01:59.437 --> 00:02:02.835
(Applause)

00:02:02.859 --> 00:02:04.152
Start as usual --

00:02:04.176 --> 00:02:06.446
(Applause)

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:08.367
go the other way around the loop.

00:02:08.391 --> 00:02:10.118
This is a little hard for children,

00:02:10.142 --> 00:02:11.636
but I think you can handle it.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.080
Pull the knot.

00:02:16.144 --> 00:02:18.976
There it is: the strong form
of the shoe knot.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.976
Now, in keeping with today's theme,

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.531
I'd like to point out --
something you already know --

00:02:25.555 --> 00:02:29.387
that sometimes a small advantage
someplace in life

00:02:29.411 --> 00:02:32.204
can yield tremendous results
someplace else.

00:02:32.228 --> 00:02:33.303
(Laughter)

00:02:33.327 --> 00:02:34.733
Live long and prosper.

00:02:34.757 --> 00:02:37.674
(Applause)
