00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
I want to share with you

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
over the next 18 minutes

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
a pretty incredible idea.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Actually, it's a really big idea.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
But to get us started,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
I want to ask if everyone

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
could just close your eyes for two seconds

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
and try and think of a technology or a bit of science

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
that you think has changed the world.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Now I bet, in this audience,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
you're thinking of some really incredible technology,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
some stuff that I haven't even heard of,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
I'm absolutely sure.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
But I'm also sure, pretty sure,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
that absolutely nobody is thinking of this.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
This is a polio vaccine.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
And it's a great thing actually

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
that nobody's had to think about it here today

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
because it means that we can take this for granted.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
This is a great technology.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
We can take it completely for granted.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
But it wasn't always that way.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
Even here in California,

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
if we were to go back just a few years,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
it was a very different story.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
People were terrified of this disease.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
They were terrified of polio, and it would cause public panic.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
And it was because of scenes like this.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
In this scene,

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
people are living in an iron lung.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
These are people who were perfectly healthy two or three days before,

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
and then two days later,

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
they can no longer breathe,

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
and this polio virus has paralyzed

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
not only their arms and their legs,

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
but also their breathing muscles.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
And they were going to spend the rest of their lives, usually,

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
in this iron lung to breathe for them.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
This disease was terrifying.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
There was no cure,

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
and there was no vaccine.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
The disease was so terrifying

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
that the president of the United States

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
launched an extraordinary national effort

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
to find a way to stop it.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
Twenty years later, they succeeded

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
and developed the polio vaccine.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
It was hailed as a scientific miracle

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
in the late 1950s.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000
Finally, a vaccine that could stop this awful disease,

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
and here in the United States

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
it had an incredible impact.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
As you can see, the virus stopped,

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000
and it stopped very, very fast.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000
But this wasn't the case

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
everywhere in the world.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000
And it happened so fast in the United States, however,

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000
that even just last month Jon Stewart said this:

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
(Video) Jon Stewart: Where is polio still active?

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
Because I thought that had been eradicated

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
in the way that smallpox had been eradicated.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.000
Bruce Aylward: Oops. Jon, polio's almost been eradicated.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
But the reality is

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
that polio still exists today.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000
We made this map for Jon to try to show him exactly where polio still exists.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
This is the picture.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
There's not very much left in the world.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
But the reason there's not very much left

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000
is because there's been an extraordinary public/private partnership

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000
working behind the scenes, almost unknown,

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000
I'm sure to most of you here today.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
It's been working for 20 years

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
to try and eradicate this disease,

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
and it's got it down to these few cases

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000
that you can see here on this graphic.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000
But just last year,

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000
we had an incredible shock

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000
and realized that almost just isn't good enough

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000
with a virus like polio.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000
And this is the reason:

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
in two countries

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000
that hadn't had this disease for more than probably a decade,

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000
on opposite sides of the globe,

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.000
there was suddenly terrible polio outbreaks.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000
Hundreds of people were paralyzed.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.000
Hundreds of people died --

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
children as well as adults.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
And in both cases,

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000
we were able to use genetic sequencing to look at the polio viruses,

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000
and we could tell these viruses were not from these countries.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.000
They had come from thousands of miles away.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.000
And in one case, it originated on another continent.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000
And not only that, but when they came into these countries,

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.000
then they got on commercial jetliners probably

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000
and they traveled even farther

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000
to other places like Russia,

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
where, for the first time in over a decade last year,

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
children were crippled and paralyzed

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.000
by a disease that they had not seen for years.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.000
Now all of these outbreaks that I just showed you,

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000
these are under control now,

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000
and it looks like they'll probably stop very, very quickly.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000
But the message was very clear.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000
Polio is still

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.000
a devastating, explosive disease.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.000
It's just happening in another part of the world.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000
And our big idea

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:31.000
is that the scientific miracle of this decade

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000
should be the complete eradication

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000
of poliomyelitis.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000
So I want to tell you a little bit

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000
about what this partnership, the Polio Partnership,

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000
is trying to do.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000
We're not trying to control polio.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.000
We're not trying to get it down to just a few cases,

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000
because this disease is like a root fire;

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.000
it can explode again if you don't snuff it out completely.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000
So what we're looking for

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000
is a permanent solution.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.000
We want a world in which every child, just like you guys,

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000
can take for granted

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000
a polio-free world.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000
So we're looking for a permanent solution,

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000
and this is where we get lucky.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000
This is one of the very few viruses in the world

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000
where there are big enough cracks in its armor

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.000
that we can try to do something truly extraordinary.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.000
This virus can only survive in people.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000
It can't live for a very long time in people.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.000
It doesn't survive in the environment hardly at all.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.000
And we've got pretty good vaccines, as I've just showed you.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000
So we are trying

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000
to wipe out this virus completely.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000
What the polio eradication program is trying to do

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.000
is to kill the virus itself

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000
that causes polio

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000
everywhere on Earth.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000
Now we don't have a great track record

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000
when it comes to doing something like this,

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000
to eradicating diseases.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.000
It's been tried six times in the last century,

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:52.000
and it's been successful exactly once.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.000
And this is because disease eradication,

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.000
it's still the venture capital of public health.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000
The risks are massive,

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000
but the pay-off --

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000
economic, humanitarian, motivational --

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000
it's absolutely huge.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.000
One congressman here in the United States

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.000
thinks that the entire investment

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000
that the U.S. put into smallpox eradication

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.000
pays itself off every 26 days --

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000
in foregone treatment costs

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000
and vaccination costs.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.000
And if we can finish polio eradication,

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000
the poorest countries in the world

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:31.000
are going to save over 50 billion dollars

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:34.000
in the next 25 years alone.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.000
So those are the kind of stakes that we're after.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000
But smallpox eradication was hard;

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.000
it was very, very hard.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.000
And polio eradication, in many ways, is even tougher,

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.000
and there's a few reasons for that.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000
The first is that,

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000
when we started trying to eradicate polio

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000
about 20 years ago,

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000
more than twice as many countries were infected

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.000
than had been when we started off with smallpox.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000
And there were more than 10 times as many people

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000
living in these countries.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000
So it was a massive effort.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.000
The second challenge we had was --

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.000
in contrast to the smallpox vaccine,

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:11.000
which was very stable, and a single dose protected you for life --

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.000
the polio vaccine is incredibly fragile.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.000
It deteriorates so quickly in the tropics

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.000
that we've had to put this special vaccine monitor

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.000
on every single vial

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.000
so that it will change very quickly

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.000
when it's exposed to too much heat,

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:28.000
and we can tell that it's not a good vaccine to use on a child --

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000
it's not potent; it's not going to protect them.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.000
Even then, kids need many doses of the vaccine.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.000
But the third challenge we have --

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.000
and probably even bigger one, the biggest challenge --

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:41.000
is that, in contrast to smallpox where you could always see your enemy --

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:44.000
every single person almost who was infected with smallpox

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.000
had this telltale rash.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.000
So you could get around the disease;

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:51.000
you could vaccinate around the disease and cut it off.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:54.000
With polio it's almost completely different.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.000
The vast majority of people who are infected with the polio virus

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:00.000
show absolutely no sign of the disease.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.000
So you can't see the enemy most of the time,

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.000
and as a result,

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:08.000
we've needed a very different approach to eradicate polio

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.000
than what was done with smallpox.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000
We've had to create

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.000
one of the largest social movements in history.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.000
There's over 10 million people,

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.000
probably 20 million people,

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.000
largely volunteers,

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.000
who have been working over the last 20 years

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.000
in what has now been called

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:29.000
the largest internationally-coordinated operation in peacetime.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:32.000
These people, these 20 million people,

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:35.000
vaccinate over 500 million children

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.000
every single year,

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.000
multiple times

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.000
at the peak of our operation.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.000
Now giving the polio vaccine is simple.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000
It's just two drops, like that.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.000
But reaching 500 million people

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000
is much, much tougher.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:53.000
And these vaccinators, these volunteers,

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.000
they have got to dive headlong

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.000
into some of the toughest, densest

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.000
urban slums in the world.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:02.000
They've got to trek under sweltering suns

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:06.000
to some of the most remote, difficult to reach places in the world.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.000
And they also have to dodge bullets,

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.000
because we have got to operate

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.000
during shaky cease-fires and truces

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.000
to try and vaccinate children,

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:17.000
even in areas affected by conflict.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.000
One reporter

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:22.000
who was watching our program in Somalia about five years ago --

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.000
a place which has eradicated polio,

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.000
not once, but twice, because they got reinfected.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.000
He was sitting outside of the road,

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.000
watching one of these polio campaigns unfold,

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.000
and a few months later he wrote:

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:36.000
"This is foreign aid at its most heroic."

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.000
And these heroes, they come from every walk of life,

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.000
all sorts of backgrounds.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:43.000
But one of the most extraordinary is Rotary International.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.000
This is a group

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.000
whose million-strong army of volunteers

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.000
have been working to eradicate polio

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.000
for over 20 years.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:54.000
They're right at the center of the whole thing.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.000
Now it took years to build up the infrastructure

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.000
for polio eradication --

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:01.000
more than 15 years, much longer than it should have --

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:04.000
but once it was built, the results were striking.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.000
Within a couple of years,

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.000
every country that started polio eradication

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:12.000
rapidly eradicated all three of their polio viruses,

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:15.000
with the exception of four countries that you see here.

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:18.000
And in each of those, it was only part of the country.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.000
And then, by 1999,

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.000
one of the three polio viruses

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.000
that we were trying to eradicate

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:28.000
had been completely eradicated worldwide --

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.000
proof of concept.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:33.000
And then today,

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.000
there's been a 99 percent reduction --

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.000
greater than 99 percent reduction --

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.000
in the number of children

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:42.000
who are being paralyzed by this awful disease.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.000
When we started, over 20 years ago,

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.000
1,000 children were being paralyzed

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:49.000
every single day by this virus.

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:52.000
Last year, it was 1,000.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:54.000
And at the same time,

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.000
the polio eradication program

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.000
has been working to help with a lot of other areas.

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:01.000
It's been working to help control pandemic flu,

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:03.000
SARS for example.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:06.000
It's also tried to save children by doing other things --

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:09.000
giving vitamin A drops, giving measles shots,

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.000
giving bed nets against malaria even

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.000
during some of these campaigns.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.000
But the most exciting thing

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.000
that the polio eradication program has been doing

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.000
has been to force us,

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.000
the international community,

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:24.000
to reach every single child, every single community,

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:27.000
the most vulnerable people in the world,

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.000
with the most basic of health services,

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:33.000
irrespective of geography, poverty,

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.000
culture and even conflict.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:37.000
So things were looking very exciting,

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.000
and then about five years ago,

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:42.000
this virus, this ancient virus, started to fight back.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:45.000
The first problem we ran into

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:48.000
was that, in these last four countries, the strongholds of this virus,

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:52.000
we just couldn't seem to get the virus rooted out.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.000
And then to make the matters even worse,

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:57.000
the virus started to spread out of these four places,

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:00.000
especially northern India and northern Nigeria,

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:03.000
into much of Africa, Asia, and even into Europe,

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:05.000
causing horrific outbreaks

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:09.000
in places that had not seen this disease for decades.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:11.000
And then,

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:14.000
in one of the most important, tenacious

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:17.000
and toughest reservoirs of the polio virus in the world,

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:20.000
we found that our vaccine was working

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.000
half as well as it should have.

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:24.000
In conditions like this,

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:26.000
the vaccine just couldn't get the grip it needed to

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.000
in the guts of these children

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.000
and protect them the way that it needed to.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.000
Now at that time,

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.000
there was a great, as you can imagine,

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.000
frustration -- let's call it frustration --

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.000
it started to grow very, very quickly.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.000
And all of a sudden, some very important voices

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:42.000
in the world of public health

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:44.000
started to say, "Hang on.

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:47.000
We should abandon this idea of eradication.

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:50.000
Let's settle for control -- that's good enough."

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:54.000
Now as seductive as the idea of control sounds,

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.000
it's a false premise.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.000
The brutal truth is,

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.000
if we don't have the will or the skill,

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:03.000
or even the money that we need

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:06.000
to reach children, the most vulnerable children in the world,

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.000
with something as simple

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:11.000
as an oral polio vaccine,

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:13.000
then pretty soon,

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:15.000
more than 200,000 children

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:17.000
are again going to be paralyzed by this disease

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:19.000
every single year.

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:21.000
There's absolutely no question.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:24.000
These are children like Umar.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:27.000
Umar is seven years old,

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:29.000
and he's from northern Nigeria.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:31.000
He lives in a family home there

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.000
with his eight brothers and sisters.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:36.000
Umar also has polio.

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.000
Umar was paralyzed for life.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.000
His right leg was paralyzed

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:42.000
in 2004.

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:45.000
This leg, his right leg,

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.000
now takes an awful beating

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:49.000
because he has to half-crawl,

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:51.000
because it's faster to move that way

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:53.000
to keep up with his friends, keep up with his brothers and sisters,

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:56.000
than to get up on his crutches and walk.

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:59.000
But Umar is a fantastic student. He's an incredible kid.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:01.000
As you probably can't see the detail here,

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:03.000
but this is his report card,

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:05.000
and you'll see, he's got perfect scores.

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:07.000
He got 100 percent in all the important things,

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:10.000
like nursery rhymes, for example there.

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:13.000
But you know I'd love to be able to tell you

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:15.000
that Umar is a typical kid with polio these days,

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:17.000
but it's not true.

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:19.000
Umar is an exceptional kid

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:21.000
in exceptional circumstances.

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:23.000
The reality of polio today

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:26.000
is something very different.

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:30.000
Polio strikes the poorest communities in the world.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.000
It leaves their children paralyzed,

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.000
and it drags their families

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:36.000
deeper into poverty,

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:38.000
because they're desperately searching

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:40.000
and they're desperately spending the little bit of savings that they have,

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.000
trying in vain

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:45.000
to find a cure for their children.

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:49.000
We think children deserve better.

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:52.000
And so when the going got really tough

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:54.000
in the polio eradication program

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:56.000
about two years ago,

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:58.000
when people were saying, "We should call it off,"

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:00.000
the Polio Partnership

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.000
decided to buckle down once again

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:05.000
and try and find innovative new solutions,

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:07.000
new ways to get to the children

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:09.000
that we were missing again and again.

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:11.000
In northern India, we started mapping the cases

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:13.000
using satellite imaging like this,

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:16.000
so that we could guide our investments and vaccinator shelters,

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:18.000
so we could get to the millions of children

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.000
on the Koshi River basin

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:22.000
where there are no other health services.

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:24.000
In northern Nigeria,

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:26.000
the political leaders and the traditional Muslim leaders,

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:28.000
they got directly involved in the program

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:30.000
to help solve the problems of logistics

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:32.000
and community confidence.

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:35.000
And now they've even started using these devices --

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:37.000
speaking of cool technology --

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:40.000
these little devices, little GIS trackers like this,

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:43.000
which they put into the vaccine carriers of their vaccinators.

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:45.000
And then they can track them,

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:47.000
and at the end of the day, they look and see,

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:49.000
did these guys get every single street, every single house.

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:52.000
This is the kind of commitment now we're seeing

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:55.000
to try and reach all of the children we've been missing.

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:58.000
And in Afghanistan, we're trying new approaches --

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:00.000
access negotiators.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:03.000
We're working closely with the International Committee of the Red Cross

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:06.000
to ensure that we can reach every child.

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:09.000
But as we tried these extraordinary things,

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:11.000
as people went to this trouble

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:13.000
to try and rework their tactics,

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:16.000
we went back to the vaccine -- it's a 50-year-old vaccine --

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:19.000
and we thought, surely we can make a better vaccine,

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:21.000
so that when they finally get to these kids,

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:23.000
we can have a better bang for our buck.

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:26.000
And this started an incredible collaboration with industry,

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:28.000
and within six months,

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:30.000
we were testing a new polio vaccine

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:32.000
that targeted, just two years ago,

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:35.000
the last two types of polio in the world.

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:38.000
Now June the ninth, 2009,

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:41.000
we got the first results from the first trial with this vaccine,

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:43.000
and it turned out to be a game-changer.

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:45.000
The new vaccine

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:48.000
had twice the impact on these last couple of viruses

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:50.000
as the old vaccine had,

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:52.000
and we immediately started using this.

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:55.000
Well, in a couple of months we had to get it out of production.

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:57.000
And it started rolling off the production lines

00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:59.000
and into the mouths of children around the world.

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:01.000
And we didn't start with the easy places.

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:03.000
The first place this vaccine was used

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:05.000
was in southern Afghanistan,

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:07.000
because it's in places like that

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:09.000
where kids are going to benefit the most

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:11.000
from technologies like this.

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:14.000
Now here at TED, over the last couple of days,

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:18.000
I've seen people challenging the audience again and again

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:21.000
to believe in the impossible.

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:24.000
So this morning at about seven o'clock,

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:26.000
I decided that we'd try to drive Chris

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:28.000
and the production crew here berserk

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:32.000
by downloading all of our data from India again,

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:34.000
so that you could see something

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:36.000
that's just unfolding today,

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:40.000
which proves that the impossible is possible.

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:43.000
And only two years ago, people were saying that this is impossible.

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:46.000
Now remember, northern India is the perfect storm

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:48.000
when it comes to polio.

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:50.000
Over 500,000 children

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:53.000
are born in the two states that have never stopped polio --

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:56.000
Uttar Pradesh and Bihar --

00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:58.000
500,000 children every single month.

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:00.000
Sanitation is terrible,

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:02.000
and our old vaccine, you remember,

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:05.000
worked half as well as it should have.

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:08.000
And yet, the impossible is happening.

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:12.000
Today marks exactly six months --

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:14.000
and for the first time in history,

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:16.000
not a single child has been paralyzed

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:18.000
in Uttar Pradesh or Bihar.

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:29.000
(Applause)

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:32.000
India's not unique.

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:34.000
In Umar's home country of Nigeria,

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:36.000
a 95 percent reduction

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:39.000
in the number of children paralyzed by polio last year.

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:41.000
And in the last six months,

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:43.000
we've had less places reinfected by polio

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:46.000
than at any other time in history.

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:49.000
Ladies and gentlemen, with a combination

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:51.000
of smart people, smart technology

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:53.000
and smart investments,

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:57.000
polio can now be eradicated anywhere.

00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:59.000
We have major challenges, you can imagine,

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:01.000
to finish this job,

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:03.000
but as you've also seen,

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:05.000
it's doable,

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:07.000
it has great secondary benefits,

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:10.000
and polio eradication is a great buy.

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:13.000
And as long as any child anywhere

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:15.000
is paralyzed by this virus,

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:17.000
it's a stark reminder

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:20.000
that we are failing, as a society, to reach children

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:22.000
with the most basic of services.

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:24.000
And for that reason, polio eradication:

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:27.000
it's the ultimate in equity

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:30.000
and it's the ultimate in social justice.

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:32.000
The huge social movement

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:34.000
that's been involved in polio eradication

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:36.000
is ready to do way more for these children.

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:39.000
It's ready to reach them with bed nets, with other things.

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:42.000
But capitalizing on their enthusiasm,

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:44.000
capitalizing on their energy

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:46.000
means finishing the job

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:49.000
that they started 20 years ago.

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:52.000
Finishing polio is a smart thing to do,

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:54.000
and it's the right thing to do.

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:57.000
Now we're in tough times economically.

00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:00.000
But as David Cameron of the United Kingdom

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:03.000
said about a month ago when he was talking about polio,

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:05.000
"There's never a wrong time

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:07.000
to do the right thing."

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:09.000
Finishing polio eradication

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:11.000
is the right thing to do.

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:13.000
And we are at a crossroads right now

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:15.000
in this great effort over the last 20 years.

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:17.000
We have a new vaccine,

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:19.000
we have new resolve,

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:21.000
and we have new tactics.

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:23.000
We have the chance

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:26.000
to write an entirely new polio-free chapter

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:29.000
in human history.

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:32.000
But if we blink now,

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:34.000
we will lose forever

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:38.000
the chance to eradicate an ancient disease.

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:42.000
Here's a great idea to spread:

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:44.000
End polio now.

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:46.000
Help us tell the story.

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:48.000
Help us build the momentum

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:50.000
so that very soon

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:52.000
every child, every parent

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:54.000
everywhere

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:56.000
can also take for granted

00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:59.000
a polio-free life forever.

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:01.000
Thank you.

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:23.000
(Applause)

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:26.000
Bill Gates: Well Bruce, where do you think the toughest places are going to be?

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:29.000
Where would you say we need to be the smartest?

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:32.000
BA: The four places where you saw, that we've never stopped --

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:34.000
northern Nigeria, northern India,

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:36.000
the southern corner of Afghanistan

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:38.000
and bordering areas of Pakistan --

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:40.000
they're going to be the toughest.

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:42.000
But the interesting thing is, of those three,

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:44.000
India's looking real good, as you just saw in the data.

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:46.000
And Afghanistan, Afghanistan, we think

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:48.000
has probably stopped polio repeatedly.

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:50.000
It keeps getting reinfected.

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:52.000
So the tough ones: going to get the top of Nigeria finished

00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:54.000
and getting Pakistan finished.

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:56.000
They're going to be the tough ones.

00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:58.000
BG: Now what about the money?

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:01.000
Give us a sense of how much the campaign costs a year.

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:04.000
And is it easy to raise that money?

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:06.000
And what's it going to be like the next couple of years?

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:08.000
BA: It's interesting.

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:10.000
We spend right now about 750 million

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:13.000
to 800 million dollars a year.

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:15.000
That's what it costs to reach 500 million children.

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:18.000
It sounds like a lot of money; it is a lot of money.

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:21.000
But when you're reaching 500 million children multiple times --

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:23.000
20, 30 cents to reach a child --

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:25.000
that's not very much money.

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:27.000
But right now we don't have enough of that.

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:29.000
We have a big gap in that money. We're cutting corners,

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:31.000
and every time we cut corners,

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:34.000
more places get infected that shouldn't have, and it just slows us down.

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:37.000
And that great buy costs us a little bit more.

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:40.000
BG: Well, hopefully we'll get the word out,

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:43.000
and the governments will keep their generosity up.

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:45.000
So good luck. We're all in this with you.

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:47.000
Thank you. (BA: Thank you.)

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:49.000
(Applause)
