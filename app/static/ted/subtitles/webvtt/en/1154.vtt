00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
The story I wanted to share with you today

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.000
is my challenge as an Iranian artist,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
as an Iranian woman artist,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
as an Iranian woman artist

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
living in exile.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Well, it has its pluses and minuses.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
On the dark side,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
politics doesn't seem to escape people like me.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Every Iranian artist, in one form or another,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
is political.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Politics have defined our lives.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
If you're living in Iran,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
you're facing censorship, harassment,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
arrest, torture --

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
at times, execution.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
If you're living outside like me,

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
you're faced with life in exile --

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
the pain of the longing

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
and the separation from your loved ones

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
and your family.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
Therefore, we don't find

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
the moral, emotional,

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
psychological and political space

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
to distance ourselves from the reality

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
of social responsibility.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
Oddly enough,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
an artist such as myself

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000
finds herself also in the position of being the voice,

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
the speaker of my people,

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
even if I have, indeed,

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
no access to my own country.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
Also, people like myself,

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
we're fighting two battles on different grounds.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
We're being critical of the West,

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
the perception of the West

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
about our identity --

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
about the image that is constructed about us,

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000
about our women, about our politics,

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
about our religion.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
We are there to take pride

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
and insist on respect.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
And at the same time,

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
we're fighting another battle.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
That is our regime,

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
our government --

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
our atrocious government,

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
[that] has done every crime

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
in order to stay in power.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000
Our artists are at risk.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
We are in a position of danger.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
We pose a threat

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
to the order of the government.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
But ironically,

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
this situation

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
has empowered all of us,

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
because we are considered, as artists,

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000
central to the cultural, political,

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
social discourse in Iran.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000
We are there to inspire, to provoke,

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
to mobilize,

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
to bring hope to our people.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
We are the reporters of our people,

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
and are communicators

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
to the outside world.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
Art is our weapon.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
Culture is a form of resistance.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
I envy sometimes the artists of the West

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
for their freedom of expression.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000
For the fact that they can distance themselves

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
from the question of politics.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
From the fact that they are only serving one audience,

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
mainly the Western culture.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.000
But also, I worry about the West,

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
because often in this country,

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
in this Western world that we have,

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.000
culture risks being a form of entertainment.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000
Our people depend on our artists,

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000
and culture is beyond communication.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
My journey as an artist

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000
started from a very, very personal place.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000
I did not start

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
to make social commentary

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
about my country.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.000
The first one that you see in front of you

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
is actually when I first returned to Iran

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.000
after being separated for a good 12 years.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000
It was after the Islamic Revolution

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000
of 1979.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000
While I was absent from Iran,

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000
the Islamic Revolution had descended on Iran

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000
and had entirely transformed the country

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.000
from Persian to the Islamic culture.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.000
I came mainly to be reunited with my family

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000
and to reconnect in a way

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000
that I found my place in the society.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
But instead, I found a country

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
that was totally ideological

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.000
and that I didn't recognize anymore.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000
More so, I became very interested,

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000
as I was facing

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000
my own personal dilemmas and questions,

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000
I became immersed in the study

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000
of the Islamic Revolution --

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000
how, indeed,

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000
it had incredibly transformed

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000
the lives of Iranian women.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000
I found the subject of Iranian women

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000
immensely interesting,

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000
in the way the women of Iran, historically,

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000
seemed to embody the political transformation.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000
So in a way, by studying a woman,

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:37.000
you can read the structure and the ideology of the country.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000
So I made a group of work

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:43.000
that at once faced my own personal questions in life,

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.000
and yet it brought my work into a larger discourse --

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000
the subject of martyrdom,

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.000
the question of those who willingly stand in that intersection

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.000
of love of God, faith,

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.000
but violence and crime and cruelty.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.000
For me, this became incredibly important.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.000
And yet, I had an unusual position toward this.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000
I was an outsider

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.000
who had come back to Iran to find my place,

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000
but I was not in a position

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.000
to be critical of the government

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000
or the ideology of the Islamic Revolution.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000
This changed slowly

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000
as I found my voice

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000
and I discovered things

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000
that I didn't know I would discover.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.000
So my art became slightly more critical.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000
My knife became a little sharper.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:35.000
And I fell into a life in exile.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000
I am a nomadic artist.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.000
I work in Morocco, in Turkey, in Mexico.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.000
I go everywhere to make believe it's Iran.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000
Now I am making films.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000
Last year, I finished a film

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.000
called "Women Without Men."

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000
"Women Without Men" returns to history,

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.000
but another part of our Iranian history.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000
It goes to 1953

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.000
when American CIA exercised a coup

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000
and removed a democratically elected leader,

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.000
Dr. Mossadegh.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000
The book is written by an Iranian woman,

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000
Shahrnush Parsipur.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.000
It's a magical realist novel.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.000
This book is banned,

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.000
and she spent five years in prison.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000
My obsession with this book,

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000
and the reason I made this into a film,

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.000
is because it at once was addressing

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.000
the question of being a female --

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.000
traditionally, historically in Iran --

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000
and the question of four women

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000
who are all looking for an idea

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.000
of change, freedom and democracy --

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:34.000
while the country of Iran, equally, as if another character,

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000
also struggled for an idea

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.000
of freedom and democracy

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.000
and independence from the foreign interventions.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.000
I made this film

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.000
because I felt it's important

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000
for it to speak to the Westerners

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.000
about our history as a country.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.000
That all of you seem to remember Iran

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000
after the Islamic Revolution.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.000
That Iran was once a secular society,

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.000
and we had democracy,

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000
and this democracy was stolen from us

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.000
by the American government,

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.000
by the British government.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:08.000
This film also speaks to the Iranian people

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.000
in asking them to return to their history

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:14.000
and look at themselves before they were so Islamicized --

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.000
in the way we looked, in the way we played music,

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.000
in the way we had intellectual life.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.000
And most of all,

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:26.000
in the way that we fought for democracy.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.000
These are some of the shots actually from my film.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000
These are some of the images of the coup.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:34.000
And we made this film in Casablanca,

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000
recreating all the shots.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.000
This film tried to find a balance

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.000
between telling a political story,

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.000
but also a feminine story.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.000
Being a visual artist, indeed,

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.000
I am foremost interested to make art --

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.000
to make art that transcends

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000
politics, religion,

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:55.000
the question of feminism,

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.000
and become an important, timeless,

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.000
universal work of art.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.000
The challenge I have

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.000
is how to do that.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.000
How to tell a political story but an allegorical story.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.000
How to move you with your emotions,

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.000
but also make your mind work.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000
These are some of the images

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.000
and the characters of the film.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.000
Now comes the green movement --

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.000
the summer of 2009,

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000
as my film is released --

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:34.000
the uprising begins in the streets of Tehran.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:37.000
What is unbelievably ironic

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:40.000
is the period that we tried to depict in the film,

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000
the cry for democracy

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.000
and social justice,

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000
repeats itself now

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.000
again in Tehran.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000
The green movement

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.000
significantly inspired the world.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:55.000
It brought a lot of attention to all those Iranians

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.000
who stand for basic human rights

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.000
and struggle for democracy.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.000
What was most significant for me

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.000
was, once again,

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.000
the presence of the women.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.000
They're absolutely inspirational for me.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.000
If in the Islamic Revolution,

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.000
the images of the woman portrayed

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.000
were submissive

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.000
and didn't have a voice,

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.000
now we saw a new idea of feminism

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:20.000
in the streets of Tehran --

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.000
women who were educated,

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.000
forward thinking, non-traditional,

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:27.000
sexually open, fearless

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:30.000
and seriously feminist.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:33.000
These women and those young men

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.000
united Iranians

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:38.000
across the world, inside and outside.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.000
I then discovered

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.000
why I take so much inspiration

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:44.000
from Iranian women.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.000
That, under all circumstances,

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.000
they have pushed the boundary.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.000
They have confronted the authority.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.000
They have broken every rule

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.000
in the smallest and the biggest way.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.000
And once again, they proved themselves.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.000
I stand here to say

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:01.000
that Iranian women have found a new voice,

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:04.000
and their voice is giving me my voice.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.000
And it's a great honor

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:09.000
to be an Iranian woman and an Iranian artist,

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:13.000
even if I have to operate in the West only for now.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.000
Thank you so much.

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:23.000
(Applause)
