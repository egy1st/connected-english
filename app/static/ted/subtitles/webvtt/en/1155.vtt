00:00:01.396 --> 00:00:05.047
A few weeks ago, I had a chance
to go to Saudi Arabia.

00:00:05.484 --> 00:00:08.093
And the first thing
I wanted to do as a Muslim

00:00:08.117 --> 00:00:10.518
was to go to Mecca and visit the Kaaba,

00:00:10.542 --> 00:00:11.976
the holiest shrine of Islam.

00:00:12.335 --> 00:00:15.015
And I did that;
I put on my ritualistic dress,

00:00:15.039 --> 00:00:16.547
I went to the holy mosque,

00:00:16.571 --> 00:00:18.250
I did my prayers,

00:00:18.274 --> 00:00:19.976
I observed all the rituals.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.377
And meanwhile,
besides all the spirituality,

00:00:24.401 --> 00:00:26.698
there was one mundane detail in the Kaaba

00:00:26.722 --> 00:00:28.420
that was pretty interesting for me:

00:00:28.444 --> 00:00:30.203
there was no separation of sexes.

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:33.976
In other words, men and women
were worshiping all together.

00:00:34.825 --> 00:00:39.603
They were together while doing tawāf,
the circular walk around the Kaaba.

00:00:39.627 --> 00:00:41.220
They were together while praying.

00:00:41.244 --> 00:00:44.802
And if you wonder
why this is interesting at all,

00:00:44.826 --> 00:00:47.407
you have to see the rest of Saudi Arabia,

00:00:47.431 --> 00:00:51.976
because this a country which is strictly
divided between the sexes.

00:00:52.588 --> 00:00:53.754
In other words:

00:00:53.778 --> 00:00:57.521
as men, you are simply not supposed to be
in the same physical space

00:00:57.545 --> 00:00:58.709
with women.

00:00:58.733 --> 00:01:00.619
And I noticed this in a very funny way.

00:01:00.643 --> 00:01:03.860
I left the Kaaba to eat something
in downtown Mecca.

00:01:04.408 --> 00:01:06.846
I headed to the nearest
Burger King restaurant.

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:10.626
And I went there -- I noticed
that there was a male section,

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.448
which is carefully separated
from the female section.

00:01:13.472 --> 00:01:16.083
I had to pay, order and eat
in the male section.

00:01:16.686 --> 00:01:18.480
"It's funny," I said to myself,

00:01:18.504 --> 00:01:21.308
"You can mingle with the opposite sex
at the holy Kaaba,

00:01:21.332 --> 00:01:22.976
but not at the Burger King?"

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.030
(Laughter)

00:01:24.054 --> 00:01:25.756
Quite, quite ironic.

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:28.047
Ironic, and it's also,
I think, quite telling,

00:01:28.071 --> 00:01:31.651
because the Kaaba
and the rituals around it

00:01:31.675 --> 00:01:34.564
are relics from the earliest
phase of Islam,

00:01:34.588 --> 00:01:35.976
that of prophet Muhammad.

00:01:36.418 --> 00:01:40.269
And if there was a big emphasis
at the time to separate men from women,

00:01:40.293 --> 00:01:43.411
the rituals around the Kaaba
could have been designed accordingly.

00:01:43.435 --> 00:01:45.803
But apparently, that was not
an issue at the time.

00:01:45.827 --> 00:01:47.228
So the rituals came that way.

00:01:47.252 --> 00:01:49.780
This is also, I think,
confirmed by the fact

00:01:49.804 --> 00:01:53.457
that the seclusion of women
in creating a divided society

00:01:53.481 --> 00:01:56.977
is something that you also
do not find in the Koran --

00:01:57.001 --> 00:02:00.063
the very core of Islam,
the divine core of Islam --

00:02:00.087 --> 00:02:02.500
that all Muslims, equally myself, believe.

00:02:03.794 --> 00:02:05.465
And I think it's not an accident

00:02:05.489 --> 00:02:08.976
that you don't find this idea
in the very origin of Islam,

00:02:09.379 --> 00:02:13.048
because many scholars who study
the history of Islamic thought --

00:02:13.072 --> 00:02:14.992
Muslim scholars or Westerners --

00:02:15.016 --> 00:02:19.390
think that, actually, the practice
of dividing men and women physically

00:02:19.414 --> 00:02:22.549
came as a later development in Islam,

00:02:22.573 --> 00:02:25.604
as Muslims adopted
some preexisting cultures

00:02:25.628 --> 00:02:27.314
and traditions of the Middle East.

00:02:27.338 --> 00:02:32.054
Seclusion of women was actually
a Byzantine and Persian practice,

00:02:32.078 --> 00:02:35.817
and Muslims adopted it
and made it a part of their religion.

00:02:35.841 --> 00:02:40.041
Actually, this is just one example
of a much larger phenomenon.

00:02:40.435 --> 00:02:44.060
What we call today Islamic law,
and especially Islamic culture --

00:02:44.084 --> 00:02:46.271
and there are many Islamic
cultures, actually;

00:02:46.295 --> 00:02:48.282
the one in Saudi Arabia is much different

00:02:48.306 --> 00:02:50.551
from where I come
from in Istanbul or Turkey.

00:02:50.575 --> 00:02:53.848
But still, if you're going to speak
about a Muslim culture,

00:02:53.872 --> 00:02:58.215
this has a core: the divine message
which began the religion.

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:03.278
But then many traditions, perceptions,
practices were added on top of it.

00:03:03.302 --> 00:03:06.770
And these were traditions
of the Middle East medieval traditions.

00:03:07.349 --> 00:03:10.942
There are two important
messages, or two lessons,

00:03:10.966 --> 00:03:13.112
to take from that reality.

00:03:13.632 --> 00:03:15.154
First of all, Muslims --

00:03:15.178 --> 00:03:19.060
pious, conservative, believing Muslims
who want to be loyal to their religion --

00:03:19.084 --> 00:03:21.514
should not cling onto everything
in their culture,

00:03:21.538 --> 00:03:23.746
thinking that that's divinely mandated.

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:26.976
Maybe some things are bad traditions
and they need to be changed.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.051
On the other hand, the Westerners
who look at Islamic culture

00:03:31.075 --> 00:03:33.241
and see some troubling aspects

00:03:33.265 --> 00:03:36.455
should not readily conclude
that this is what Islam ordains.

00:03:36.479 --> 00:03:40.267
Maybe it's a Middle Eastern culture
that became confused with Islam.

00:03:40.945 --> 00:03:43.583
There is a practice
called female circumcision.

00:03:44.055 --> 00:03:46.097
It's something terrible, horrible.

00:03:46.121 --> 00:03:49.970
It is basically an operation
to deprive women of sexual pleasure.

00:03:50.812 --> 00:03:52.632
And Westerners --

00:03:52.656 --> 00:03:55.976
Europeans or Americans --
who didn't know about this before,

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:57.976
[saw] this practice

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.292
within some of the Muslim communities
who migrated from North Africa.

00:04:02.316 --> 00:04:03.491
And they've thought,

00:04:03.515 --> 00:04:07.625
"Oh, what a horrible religion that is,
which ordains something like that."

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:10.370
But when you look at female circumcision,

00:04:10.394 --> 00:04:12.561
you see that it has
nothing to do with Islam;

00:04:12.585 --> 00:04:15.267
it's just a North African practice
which predates Islam.

00:04:15.291 --> 00:04:17.104
It was there for thousands of years.

00:04:17.128 --> 00:04:20.742
And, quite tellingly,
some Muslims do practice it --

00:04:20.766 --> 00:04:23.211
the Muslims in North Africa,
not in other places.

00:04:23.235 --> 00:04:26.881
But also the non-Muslim
communities of North Africa --

00:04:26.905 --> 00:04:30.906
the animists, some Christians
and even a Jewish tribe in North Africa --

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:33.198
are known to practice female circumcision.

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:38.346
So what might look like a problem
within Islamic faith

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:41.976
might turn out to be a tradition
that Muslims have subscribed to.

00:04:42.475 --> 00:04:44.697
The same thing can be said
for honor killings,

00:04:44.721 --> 00:04:47.269
which is a recurrent theme
in the Western media --

00:04:47.293 --> 00:04:49.976
and which is, of course,
a horrible tradition.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.419
And we see, truly, in some Muslim
communities, that tradition.

00:04:53.814 --> 00:04:56.724
But in the non-Muslim communities
of the Middle East,

00:04:56.748 --> 00:04:59.398
such as some Christian communities,
Eastern communities,

00:04:59.422 --> 00:05:00.707
you see the same practice.

00:05:00.731 --> 00:05:03.366
We had a tragic case of an honor killing

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:06.537
within Turkey's Armenian community
just a few months ago.

00:05:06.561 --> 00:05:08.684
Now, these are things
about general culture,

00:05:08.708 --> 00:05:11.558
but I'm also very much
interested in political culture

00:05:11.582 --> 00:05:14.399
and whether liberty
and democracy is appreciated,

00:05:14.423 --> 00:05:17.195
or whether there's an authoritarian
political culture

00:05:17.219 --> 00:05:20.440
in which the state is supposed
to impose things on the citizens.

00:05:20.923 --> 00:05:22.631
And it is no secret

00:05:22.655 --> 00:05:25.182
that many Islamic movements
in the Middle East

00:05:25.206 --> 00:05:26.483
tend to be authoritarian,

00:05:26.507 --> 00:05:29.438
and some of the so-called
"Islamic regimes,"

00:05:29.462 --> 00:05:34.359
such as Saudi Arabia, Iran and the worst
case, the Taliban in Afghanistan,

00:05:34.383 --> 00:05:36.983
they are pretty authoritarian --
no doubt about that.

00:05:37.007 --> 00:05:38.433
For example, in Saudi Arabia,

00:05:38.457 --> 00:05:40.976
there is a phenomenon
called the religious police.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.976
And the religious police imposes
the supposed Islamic way of life

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.109
on every citizen, by force --

00:05:47.133 --> 00:05:50.117
like, women are forced
to cover their heads --

00:05:50.141 --> 00:05:52.929
wear the hijab, the Islamic head cover.

00:05:53.859 --> 00:05:55.463
Now that is pretty authoritarian,

00:05:55.487 --> 00:05:57.769
and that's something
I'm very much critical of.

00:05:58.619 --> 00:06:02.205
But when I realized that the non-Muslim,

00:06:02.229 --> 00:06:05.848
or the non-Islamic-minded
actors in the same geography

00:06:05.872 --> 00:06:07.573
sometimes behaved similarly,

00:06:07.597 --> 00:06:09.599
I realized that the problem maybe lies

00:06:09.623 --> 00:06:12.505
in the political culture
of the whole region, not just Islam.

00:06:12.529 --> 00:06:15.246
Let me give you an example:
in Turkey, where I come from,

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:17.246
which is a very hyper-secular republic,

00:06:17.677 --> 00:06:22.913
until very recently, we used to have
what I call "secularism police,"

00:06:22.937 --> 00:06:26.976
which would guard the universities
against veiled students.

00:06:27.719 --> 00:06:32.228
In other words, they would force students
to uncover their heads.

00:06:32.252 --> 00:06:34.580
And I think forcing people
to uncover their head

00:06:34.604 --> 00:06:37.719
is as tyrannical as forcing
them to cover it.

00:06:37.743 --> 00:06:39.463
It should be the citizen's decision.

00:06:39.487 --> 00:06:41.146
But when I saw that, I said,

00:06:41.170 --> 00:06:44.976
"Maybe the problem is just
an authoritarian culture in the region,

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.852
and some Muslims
have been influenced by that.

00:06:47.876 --> 00:06:50.531
But the secular-minded people
can be influenced by that.

00:06:50.555 --> 00:06:52.739
Maybe it's a problem
of the political culture,

00:06:52.763 --> 00:06:56.223
and we have to think about
how to change that political culture."

00:06:56.656 --> 00:07:00.479
Now, these are some of the questions
I had in mind a few years ago

00:07:00.503 --> 00:07:02.207
when I sat down to write a book.

00:07:02.707 --> 00:07:04.860
I said, "Well, I will do research

00:07:04.884 --> 00:07:09.869
about how Islam actually
came to be what it is today,

00:07:09.893 --> 00:07:13.188
and what roads were taken
and what roads could have been taken."

00:07:13.867 --> 00:07:17.976
The name of the book is "Islam Without
Extremes: A Muslim Case for Liberty."

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.459
And as the subtitle suggests,

00:07:20.483 --> 00:07:23.508
I looked at Islamic tradition
and the history of Islamic thought

00:07:23.532 --> 00:07:25.610
from the perspective
of individual liberty,

00:07:25.634 --> 00:07:29.600
and I tried to find what are the strengths
with regard to individual liberty.

00:07:29.624 --> 00:07:31.726
And there are strengths
in Islamic tradition.

00:07:31.750 --> 00:07:34.063
Islam, actually,
as a monotheistic religion,

00:07:34.087 --> 00:07:38.179
which defined man
as a responsible agent by itself,

00:07:38.203 --> 00:07:40.816
created the idea of the individual
in the Middle East,

00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:45.195
and saved it from the communitarianism,
the collectivism of the tribe.

00:07:45.219 --> 00:07:47.055
You can derive many ideas from that.

00:07:47.079 --> 00:07:50.224
But besides that, I also saw
problems within Islamic tradition.

00:07:50.605 --> 00:07:52.112
But one thing was curious:

00:07:52.136 --> 00:07:55.543
most of those problems turn out to be
problems that emerged later,

00:07:55.567 --> 00:07:58.636
not from the very divine core
of Islam, the Koran,

00:07:58.660 --> 00:08:01.825
but from, again,
traditions and mentalities,

00:08:01.849 --> 00:08:05.796
or the interpretations of the Koran
that Muslims made in the Middle Ages.

00:08:06.224 --> 00:08:08.750
The Koran, for example,
doesn't condone stoning.

00:08:08.774 --> 00:08:10.750
There is no punishment for apostasy.

00:08:11.138 --> 00:08:14.196
There is no punishment
for personal sins like drinking.

00:08:14.767 --> 00:08:18.126
These things which make Islamic law,

00:08:18.150 --> 00:08:20.954
the troubling aspects of Islamic law,

00:08:20.978 --> 00:08:24.074
were developed into later
interpretations of Islam.

00:08:24.098 --> 00:08:26.185
Which means that Muslims can, today,

00:08:26.209 --> 00:08:27.955
look at those things and say,

00:08:27.979 --> 00:08:32.282
"Well, the core of our religion
is here to stay with us.

00:08:32.306 --> 00:08:34.376
It's our faith,
and we will be loyal to it.

00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:36.376
But we can change how it was interpreted,

00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:38.664
because it was interpreted
according to the time

00:08:38.688 --> 00:08:40.122
and milieu in the Middle Ages.

00:08:40.146 --> 00:08:42.003
Now we're living in a different world,

00:08:42.027 --> 00:08:44.227
with different values
and political systems."

00:08:44.251 --> 00:08:46.679
That interpretation
is quite possible and feasible.

00:08:47.198 --> 00:08:50.705
Now, if I were the only person
thinking that way,

00:08:50.729 --> 00:08:51.997
we would be in trouble.

00:08:53.066 --> 00:08:54.944
But that's not the case at all.

00:08:55.627 --> 00:08:58.534
Actually, from the 19th century on,

00:08:58.558 --> 00:09:04.516
there's a whole revisionist, reformist --
whatever you call it -- tradition,

00:09:04.540 --> 00:09:06.969
a trend in Islamic thinking.

00:09:06.993 --> 00:09:09.332
These were intellectuals or statesmen

00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:12.376
of the 19th century,
and later, 20th century,

00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:14.174
which looked at Europe, basically,

00:09:14.198 --> 00:09:16.591
and saw that Europe
has many things to admire,

00:09:16.615 --> 00:09:18.104
like science and technology.

00:09:18.128 --> 00:09:20.944
But not just that;
also democracy, parliament,

00:09:20.968 --> 00:09:22.572
the idea of representation,

00:09:22.596 --> 00:09:24.376
the idea of equal citizenship.

00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:29.257
These Muslim thinkers, intellectuals
and statesmen of the 19th century,

00:09:29.281 --> 00:09:31.427
looked at Europe,
saw these things, and said,

00:09:31.451 --> 00:09:33.040
"Why don't we have these things?"

00:09:33.064 --> 00:09:35.081
And they looked back at Islamic tradition,

00:09:35.105 --> 00:09:37.517
and saw that there are
problematic aspects,

00:09:37.541 --> 00:09:41.290
but they're not the core of the religion,
so maybe they can be re-understood,

00:09:41.314 --> 00:09:43.895
and the Koran can be reread
in the modern world.

00:09:44.392 --> 00:09:49.158
That trend is generally called
Islamic modernism,

00:09:49.281 --> 00:09:52.258
and it was advanced
by intellectuals and statesmen,

00:09:52.282 --> 00:09:54.376
not just as an intellectual idea, though,

00:09:54.400 --> 00:09:56.113
but also as a political program.

00:09:56.137 --> 00:09:58.324
And that's why, actually,
in the 19th century,

00:09:58.348 --> 00:10:01.940
the Ottoman Empire, which then
covered the whole Middle East,

00:10:01.964 --> 00:10:04.180
made very important reforms --

00:10:04.204 --> 00:10:08.790
reforms like giving Christians and Jews
an equal citizenship status,

00:10:08.814 --> 00:10:10.376
accepting a constitution,

00:10:10.400 --> 00:10:12.252
accepting a representative parliament,

00:10:12.276 --> 00:10:14.926
advancing the idea of freedom of religion.

00:10:15.400 --> 00:10:18.376
That's why the Ottoman Empire,
in its last decades,

00:10:18.400 --> 00:10:22.301
turned into a proto-democracy,
a constitutional monarchy,

00:10:22.325 --> 00:10:25.577
and freedom was a very important
political value at the time.

00:10:25.601 --> 00:10:27.377
Similarly, in the Arab world,

00:10:27.401 --> 00:10:31.010
there was what the great Arab
historian Albert Hourani defines

00:10:31.034 --> 00:10:32.185
as the Liberal Age.

00:10:32.209 --> 00:10:34.752
He has a book, "Arabic Thought
in the Liberal Age,"

00:10:34.776 --> 00:10:38.917
and the Liberal Age, he defines
as 19th century and early 20th century.

00:10:39.750 --> 00:10:44.376
Quite notably, this was the dominant trend
in the early 20th century

00:10:44.400 --> 00:10:47.252
among Islamic thinkers
and statesmen and theologians.

00:10:48.233 --> 00:10:52.081
But there is a very curious pattern
in the rest of the 20th century,

00:10:52.105 --> 00:10:56.376
because we see a sharp decline
in this Islamic modernist line.

00:10:56.400 --> 00:10:58.047
And in place of that,

00:10:58.071 --> 00:11:04.490
what happens is that Islamism grows
as an ideology which is authoritarian,

00:11:04.514 --> 00:11:06.376
which is quite strident,

00:11:06.400 --> 00:11:08.847
which is quite anti-Western,

00:11:08.871 --> 00:11:12.503
and which wants to shape society
based on a utopian vision.

00:11:12.527 --> 00:11:15.558
So Islamism is the problematic idea

00:11:15.582 --> 00:11:19.700
that really created a lot of problems
in the 20th-century Islamic world.

00:11:20.312 --> 00:11:23.681
And even the very extreme
forms of Islamism

00:11:23.705 --> 00:11:25.861
led to terrorism in the name of Islam --

00:11:26.853 --> 00:11:29.693
which is actually a practice
that I think is against Islam,

00:11:29.717 --> 00:11:32.703
but some, obviously, extremists,
did not think that way.

00:11:32.727 --> 00:11:34.376
But there is a curious question:

00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:39.376
If Islamic modernism was so popular
in the 19th and early 20th centuries,

00:11:39.400 --> 00:11:43.514
why did Islamism become so popular
in the rest of the 20th century?

00:11:43.981 --> 00:11:47.376
And this is a question, I think,
which needs to be discussed carefully.

00:11:47.400 --> 00:11:49.611
In my book, I went
into that question as well.

00:11:49.635 --> 00:11:53.206
And actually, you don't need to be
a rocket scientist to understand that.

00:11:53.230 --> 00:11:55.884
Just look at the political
history of the 20th century,

00:11:55.908 --> 00:11:57.829
and you see things have changed a lot.

00:11:57.853 --> 00:11:59.204
The contexts have changed.

00:11:59.228 --> 00:12:00.585
In the 19th century,

00:12:00.609 --> 00:12:03.423
when Muslims were looking
at Europe as an example,

00:12:03.447 --> 00:12:06.153
they were independent;
they were more self-confident.

00:12:06.177 --> 00:12:09.178
In the early 20th century,
with the fall of the Ottoman Empire,

00:12:09.202 --> 00:12:11.587
the whole Middle East was colonized.

00:12:12.018 --> 00:12:14.503
And when you have colonialization,
what do you have?

00:12:14.527 --> 00:12:16.376
You have anti-colonialization.

00:12:16.400 --> 00:12:19.376
So Europe is not just
an example now to emulate;

00:12:19.400 --> 00:12:22.137
it's an enemy to fight and to resist.

00:12:22.558 --> 00:12:26.885
So there's a very sharp decline
in liberal ideas in the Muslim world,

00:12:26.909 --> 00:12:32.180
and what you see is more of a defensive,
rigid, reactionary strain,

00:12:32.204 --> 00:12:34.401
which led to Arab socialism,
Arab nationalism

00:12:34.425 --> 00:12:36.647
and ultimately to the Islamist ideology.

00:12:37.400 --> 00:12:40.168
And when the colonial period ended,

00:12:40.192 --> 00:12:44.845
what you had in place of that
was generally secular dictators,

00:12:44.869 --> 00:12:46.490
which say they're a country,

00:12:46.514 --> 00:12:48.567
but did not bring
democracy to the country,

00:12:48.591 --> 00:12:50.469
and established their own dictatorship.

00:12:50.493 --> 00:12:53.956
And I think the West,
at least some powers in the West,

00:12:53.980 --> 00:12:55.508
particularly the United States,

00:12:55.532 --> 00:12:58.195
made the mistake of supporting
those secular dictators,

00:12:58.219 --> 00:13:01.479
thinking that they were more
helpful for their interests.

00:13:01.503 --> 00:13:05.287
But the fact that those dictators
suppressed democracy in their country

00:13:05.311 --> 00:13:07.503
and suppressed Islamic
groups in their country

00:13:07.527 --> 00:13:10.000
actually made the Islamists
much more strident.

00:13:10.024 --> 00:13:11.376
So in the 20th century,

00:13:11.400 --> 00:13:13.555
you had this vicious cycle
in the Arab world,

00:13:13.579 --> 00:13:16.582
where you have a dictatorship
suppressing its own people,

00:13:16.606 --> 00:13:18.376
including the Islamic pious,

00:13:18.400 --> 00:13:20.622
and they're reacting in reactionary ways.

00:13:21.678 --> 00:13:23.376
There was one country, though,

00:13:23.400 --> 00:13:28.497
which was able to escape or stay away
from that vicious cycle.

00:13:28.521 --> 00:13:31.201
And that's the country
where I come from, Turkey.

00:13:31.653 --> 00:13:33.891
Turkey has never been colonized,

00:13:33.915 --> 00:13:37.599
so it remained as an independent nation
after the fall of the Ottoman Empire.

00:13:37.623 --> 00:13:39.039
That's one thing to remember;

00:13:39.063 --> 00:13:41.925
it did not share
the same anti-colonial hype

00:13:41.949 --> 00:13:44.619
that you can find in some other
countries in the region.

00:13:44.643 --> 00:13:46.180
Secondly, and most importantly,

00:13:46.204 --> 00:13:47.763
Turkey became a democracy

00:13:47.787 --> 00:13:50.376
earlier than any of the countries
we are talking about.

00:13:50.400 --> 00:13:52.972
In 1950, Turkey had the first
free and fair elections,

00:13:52.996 --> 00:13:55.610
which ended the more
autocratic secular regime,

00:13:55.634 --> 00:13:57.460
which was in the beginning of Turkey.

00:13:57.484 --> 00:13:59.446
And the pious Muslims in Turkey

00:13:59.470 --> 00:14:03.539
saw that they could change
the political system by voting.

00:14:03.563 --> 00:14:07.073
And they realized that democracy
is something compatible with Islam,

00:14:07.097 --> 00:14:08.526
compatible with their values,

00:14:08.550 --> 00:14:10.527
and they've been supportive of democracy.

00:14:10.551 --> 00:14:12.376
That's an experience

00:14:12.400 --> 00:14:15.184
that not every other Muslim nation
in the Middle East had,

00:14:15.208 --> 00:14:16.376
until very recently.

00:14:16.400 --> 00:14:18.643
Secondly, in the past two decades,

00:14:18.667 --> 00:14:21.376
thanks to globalization,
thanks to the market economy,

00:14:21.400 --> 00:14:23.698
thanks to the rise of a middle class,

00:14:23.722 --> 00:14:28.701
we in Turkey see what I define
as a rebirth of Islamic modernism.

00:14:29.066 --> 00:14:32.914
Now, there's the more urban
middle-class pious Muslims

00:14:32.938 --> 00:14:35.070
who, again, look at their tradition

00:14:35.094 --> 00:14:37.980
and see that there are
some problems in the tradition,

00:14:38.004 --> 00:14:41.438
and understand that they need to be
changed and questioned and reformed.

00:14:41.462 --> 00:14:44.939
And they look at Europe,
and see an example, again, to follow.

00:14:44.963 --> 00:14:47.876
They see an example, at least,
to take some inspiration from.

00:14:47.900 --> 00:14:51.809
That's why the EU process,
Turkey's effort to join the EU,

00:14:51.833 --> 00:14:55.491
has been supported inside Turkey
by the Islamic pious,

00:14:55.515 --> 00:14:57.978
while some secular nationalists
were against it.

00:14:58.533 --> 00:15:00.839
Well, that process
has been a little bit blurred

00:15:00.863 --> 00:15:03.447
by the fact that not all
Europeans are that welcoming,

00:15:03.471 --> 00:15:05.045
but that's another discussion.

00:15:05.069 --> 00:15:08.532
But the pro-EU sentiment
in Turkey in the past decade

00:15:08.556 --> 00:15:12.552
has become almost an Islamic cause
and supported by the Islamic liberals

00:15:12.576 --> 00:15:14.706
and the secular liberals
as well, of course.

00:15:15.154 --> 00:15:16.426
And thanks to that,

00:15:16.450 --> 00:15:19.693
Turkey has been able
to reasonably create a success story

00:15:19.717 --> 00:15:24.542
in which Islam and the most pious
understandings of Islam

00:15:24.566 --> 00:15:26.553
have become part of the democratic game,

00:15:26.577 --> 00:15:30.732
and even contributes to the democratic
and economic advance of the country.

00:15:31.305 --> 00:15:34.973
And this has been
an inspiring example right now

00:15:34.997 --> 00:15:37.035
for some of the Islamic movements

00:15:37.059 --> 00:15:39.209
or some of the countries
in the Arab world.

00:15:39.233 --> 00:15:41.376
You must have all seen the Arab Spring,

00:15:41.400 --> 00:15:44.142
which began in Tunis and in Egypt.

00:15:44.166 --> 00:15:47.986
Arab masses just revolted
against their dictators.

00:15:48.603 --> 00:15:51.998
They were asking for democracy;
they were asking for freedom.

00:15:52.022 --> 00:15:54.638
And they did not turn out to be
the Islamist boogeyman

00:15:54.662 --> 00:15:59.448
that the dictators were always using
to justify their regime.

00:15:59.829 --> 00:16:02.251
They said, "We want freedom;
we want democracy.

00:16:02.275 --> 00:16:03.942
We are Muslim believers,

00:16:03.966 --> 00:16:07.864
but we want to be living
as free people in free societies."

00:16:08.253 --> 00:16:10.612
Of course, this is a long road.

00:16:10.636 --> 00:16:13.915
Democracy is not an overnight
achievement; it's a process.

00:16:13.939 --> 00:16:17.905
But this is a promising era
in the Muslim world.

00:16:17.929 --> 00:16:21.546
And I believe that the Islamic modernism
which began in the 19th century,

00:16:21.570 --> 00:16:23.780
but which had a setback
in the 20th century

00:16:23.804 --> 00:16:26.363
because of the political
troubles of the Muslim world,

00:16:26.387 --> 00:16:27.567
is having a rebirth.

00:16:27.965 --> 00:16:32.627
And I think the takeaway message
from that would be that Islam,

00:16:32.651 --> 00:16:35.183
despite some of the skeptics in the West,

00:16:35.207 --> 00:16:37.083
has the potential in itself

00:16:37.107 --> 00:16:40.686
to create its own way to democracy,
create its own way to liberalism,

00:16:40.710 --> 00:16:42.246
create its own way to freedom.

00:16:42.270 --> 00:16:44.519
They just should be allowed
to work for that.

00:16:44.832 --> 00:16:45.996
Thanks so much.

00:16:46.020 --> 00:16:51.388
(Applause)
