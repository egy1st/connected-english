00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
I spent the best part of last year

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
working on a documentary

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
about my own happiness --

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
trying to see

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
if I can actually train my mind

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
in a particular way,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
like I can train my body,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
so I can end up with an improved feeling

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
of overall well-being.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Then this January,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
my mother died,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
and pursuing a film like that

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
just seemed the last thing that was interesting to me.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
So in a very typical, silly designer fashion,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
after years worth of work,

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
pretty much all I have to show for it are the titles for the film.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:53.000
(Music)

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
They were still done

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
when I was on sabbatical with my company in Indonesia.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
We can see the first part here was designed here by pigs.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
It was a little bit too funky,

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
and we wanted a more feminine point of view

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
and employed a duck

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
who did it in a much more fitting way --

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
fashion.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
My studio in Bali

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
was only 10 minutes away from a monkey forest,

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
and monkeys, of course,

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
are supposed to be the happiest of all animals.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
So we trained them to be able to do three separate words,

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
to lay out them properly.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
You can see,

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
there still is a little bit of a legibility problem there.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
The serif is not really in place.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
So of course, what you don't do properly yourself

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
is never deemed done really.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
So this is us climbing onto the trees

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
and putting it up over the Sayan Valley

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
in Indonesia.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
In that year, what I did do a lot

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
was look at all sorts of surveys,

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
looking at a lot of data on this subject.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
And it turns out

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
that men and women

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
report very, very similar levels of happiness.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
This is a very quick overview

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
of all the studies that I looked at.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
That climate plays no role.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
That if you live in the best climate,

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
in San Diego in the United States,

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000
or in the shittiest climate, in Buffalo, New York,

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
you are going to be just as happy

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
in either place.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000
If you make more than 50,000 bucks a year in the U.S.,

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
any salary increase you're going to experience

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
will have only a tiny, tiny influence

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
on your overall well-being.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000
Black people are just as happy as white people are.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
If you're old or young

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
it doesn't really make a difference.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
If you're ugly or if you're really, really good-looking

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
it makes no difference whatsoever.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
You will adapt to it and get used to it.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000
If you have manageable health problems

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
it doesn't really matter.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
Now this does matter.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
So now the woman on the right

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000
is actually much happier than the guy on the left --

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000
meaning that, if you have a lot of friends,

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000
and you have meaningful friendships,

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
that does make a lot of difference.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
As well as being married -- you are likely to be much happier

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
than if you are single.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000
A fellow TED speaker, Jonathan Haidt,

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000
came up with this beautiful little analogy

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.000
between the conscious and the unconscious mind.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.000
He says that the conscious mind is this tiny rider

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.000
on this giant elephant, the unconscious.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
And the rider thinks

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.000
that he can tell the elephant what to do,

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.000
but the elephant really has his own ideas.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000
If I look at my own life,

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000
I'm born in 1962 in Austria.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000
If I would have been born a hundred years earlier,

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000
the big decisions in my life would have been made for me --

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:49.000
meaning I would have stayed in the town that I was born in;

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000
I would have very much likely

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000
entered the same profession that my dad did;

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.000
and I would have very much likely married a woman

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.000
that my mom had selected.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000
I, of course, and all of us,

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000
are very much in charge

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.000
of these big decisions in our lives.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000
We live where we want to be --

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000
at least in the West.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000
We become what we really are interested in.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000
We choose our own profession,

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000
and we choose our own partners.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.000
And so it's quite surprising

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000
that many of us

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.000
let our unconscious influence those decisions

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:30.000
in ways that we are not quite aware of.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
If you look at the statistics

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.000
and you see that the guy called George,

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.000
when he decides on where he wants to live --

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.000
is it Florida or North Dakota? --

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000
he goes and lives in Georgia.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000
And if you look at a guy called Dennis,

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000
when he decides what to become --

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.000
is it a lawyer, or does he want to become a doctor

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
or a teacher? --

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.000
best chance is that he wants to become a dentist.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000
And if Paula decides

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000
should she marry Joe or Jack,

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:03.000
somehow Paul sounds the most interesting.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000
And so even if we make

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000
those very important decisions

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000
for very silly reasons,

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000
it remains statistically true

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000
that there are more Georges living in Georgia

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.000
and there are more Dennises becoming dentists

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.000
and there are more Paulas who are married to Paul

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000
than statistically viable.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000
(Laughter)

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.000
Now I, of course, thought,

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000
"Well this is American data,"

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:32.000
and I thought, "Well, those silly Americans.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.000
They get influenced by things

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.000
that they're not aware of.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.000
This is just completely ridiculous."

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.000
Then, of course, I looked at my mom and my dad --

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000
(Laughter)

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.000
Karolina and Karl,

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.000
and grandmom and granddad,

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000
Josefine and Josef.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.000
So I am looking still for a Stephanie.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.000
I'll figure something out.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000
If I make this whole thing a little bit more personal

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.000
and see what makes me happy as a designer,

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.000
the easiest answer, of course,

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.000
is do more of the stuff that I like to do

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.000
and much less of the stuff that I don't like to do --

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.000
for which it would be helpful

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.000
to know what it is that I actually do like to do.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.000
I'm a big list maker,

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.000
so I came up with a list.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.000
One of them is to think without pressure.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000
This is a project we're working on right now

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000
with a very healthy deadline.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000
It's a book on culture,

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000
and, as you can see,

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.000
culture is rapidly drifting around.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.000
Doing things like I'm doing right now --

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000
traveling to Cannes.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.000
The example I have here

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.000
is a chair that came out of the year in Bali --

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:48.000
clearly influenced by local manufacturing and culture,

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.000
not being stuck behind

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.000
a single computer screen all day long

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000
and be here and there.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.000
Quite consciously, design projects

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.000
that need an incredible amount of various techniques,

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000
just basically to fight

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.000
straightforward adaptation.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.000
Being close to the content --

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:10.000
that's the content really is close to my heart.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.000
This is a bus, or vehicle,

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.000
for a charity, for an NGO

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:18.000
that wants to double the education budget in the United States --

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.000
carefully designed,

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:24.000
so, by two inches, it still clears highway overpasses.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:31.000
Having end results -- things that come back from the printer well,

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.000
like this little business card for an animation company

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.000
called Sideshow

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.000
on lenticular foils.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.000
Working on projects

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.000
that actually have visible impacts,

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:47.000
like a book for a deceased German artist

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:50.000
whose widow came to us

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:54.000
with the requirement to make her late husband famous.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.000
It just came out six months ago,

00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:00.000
and it's getting unbelievable traction right now in Germany.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000
And I think that his widow

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:05.000
is going to be very successful on her quest.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:09.000
And lately, to be involved in projects

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.000
where I know about 50 percent of the project

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.000
technique-wise

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.000
and the other 50 percent would be new.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.000
So in this case,

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.000
it's an outside projection for Singapore

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:22.000
on these giant Times Square-like screens.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:25.000
And I of course knew stuff, as a designer,

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.000
about typography,

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:30.000
even though we worked with those animals not so successfully.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000
But I didn't quite know

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:35.000
all that much about movement or film.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:38.000
And from that point of view we turned it into a lovely project.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:41.000
But also because the content was very close.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.000
In this case, "Keeping a Diary

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.000
Supports Personal Development" --

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:48.000
I've been keeping a diary since I was 12.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:52.000
And I've found that it influenced my life and work

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:55.000
in a very intriguing way.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.000
In this case also because

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:00.000
it's part of one of the many sentiments

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:04.000
that we build the whole series on --

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:07.000
that all the sentiments originally had come out of the diary.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.000
Thank you so much.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.000
(Applause)
