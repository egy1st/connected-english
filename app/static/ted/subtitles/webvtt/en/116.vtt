00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
How many Creationists do we have in the room?

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Probably none. I think we're all Darwinians.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:13.000
And yet many Darwinians are anxious, a little uneasy --

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000
would like to see some limits on just how far the Darwinism goes.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
It's all right.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
You know spiderwebs? Sure, they are products of evolution.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
The World Wide Web? Not so sure.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Beaver dams, yes. Hoover Dam, no.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:36.000
What do they think it is that prevents the products of human ingenuity

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
from being themselves, fruits of the tree of life,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.000
and hence, in some sense, obeying evolutionary rules?

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
And yet people are interestingly resistant

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:56.000
to the idea of applying evolutionary thinking to thinking -- to our thinking.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
And so I'm going to talk a little bit about that,

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
keeping in mind that we have a lot on the program here.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
So you're out in the woods, or you're out in the pasture,

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
and you see this ant crawling up this blade of grass.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
It climbs up to the top, and it falls,

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
and it climbs, and it falls, and it climbs --

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.000
trying to stay at the very top of the blade of grass.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.000
What is this ant doing? What is this in aid of?

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:33.000
What goals is this ant trying to achieve by climbing this blade of grass?

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
What's in it for the ant?

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:41.000
And the answer is: nothing. There's nothing in it for the ant.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
Well then, why is it doing this?

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
Is it just a fluke?

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:53.000
Yeah, it's just a fluke. It's a lancet fluke.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
It's a little brain worm.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.000
It's a parasitic brain worm that has to get into the stomach of a sheep or a cow

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
in order to continue its life cycle.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.000
Salmon swim upstream to get to their spawning grounds,

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000
and lancet flukes commandeer a passing ant,

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.000
crawl into its brain, and drive it up a blade of grass like an all-terrain vehicle.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.000
So there's nothing in it for the ant.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:29.000
The ant's brain has been hijacked by a parasite that infects the brain,

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
inducing suicidal behavior.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
Pretty scary.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.000
Well, does anything like that happen with human beings?

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:45.000
This is all on behalf of a cause other than one's own genetic fitness, of course.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:50.000
Well, it may already have occurred to you

00:02:50.000 --> 00:03:00.000
that Islam means "surrender," or "submission of self-interest to the will of Allah."

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:06.000
Well, it's ideas -- not worms -- that hijack our brains.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:11.000
Now, am I saying that a sizable minority of the world's population

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:17.000
has had their brain hijacked by parasitic ideas?

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000
No, it's worse than that.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.000
Most people have.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
(Laughter)

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
There are a lot of ideas to die for.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000
Freedom, if you're from New Hampshire.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000
(Laughter)

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.000
Justice. Truth. Communism.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.000
Many people have laid down their lives for communism,

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000
and many have laid down their lives for capitalism.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:51.000
And many for Catholicism. And many for Islam.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:56.000
These are just a few of the ideas that are to die for.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000
They're infectious.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:03.000
Yesterday, Amory Lovins spoke about "infectious repititis."

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000
It was a term of abuse, in effect.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000
This is unthinking engineering.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.000
Well, most of the cultural spread that goes on

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.000
is not brilliant, new, out-of-the-box thinking.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000
It's "infectious repetitis,"

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:23.000
and we might as well try to have a theory of what's going on when that happens

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:27.000
so that we can understand the conditions of infection.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:36.000
Hosts work hard to spread these ideas to others.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:42.000
I myself am a philosopher, and one of our occupational hazards

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:46.000
is that people ask us what the meaning of life is.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.000
And you have to have a bumper sticker,

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.000
you know. You have to have a statement.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000
So, this is mine.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:58.000
The secret of happiness is: Find something more important than you are

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000
and dedicate your life to it.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.000
Most of us -- now that the "Me Decade" is well in the past --

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000
now we actually do this.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000
One set of ideas or another

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:13.000
have simply replaced our biological imperatives in our own lives.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.000
This is what our summum bonum is.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.000
It's not maximizing the number of grandchildren we have.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:23.000
Now, this is a profound biological effect.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.000
It's the subordination of genetic interest to other interests.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:30.000
And no other species does anything at all like it.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000
Well, how are we going to think about this?

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:36.000
It is, on the one hand, a biological effect, and a very large one.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.000
Unmistakable.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.000
Now, what theories do we want to use to look at this?

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.000
Well, many theories. But how could something tie them together?

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.000
The idea of replicating ideas;

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:52.000
ideas that replicate by passing from brain to brain.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:57.000
Richard Dawkins, whom you'll be hearing later in the day, invented the term "memes,"

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:02.000
and put forward the first really clear and vivid version of this idea

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.000
in his book "The Selfish Gene."

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.000
Now here am I talking about his idea.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:13.000
Well, you see, it's not his. Yes -- he started it.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.000
But it's everybody's idea now.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:20.000
And he's not responsible for what I say about memes.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:24.000
I'm responsible for what I say about memes.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:28.000
Actually, I think we're all responsible

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:34.000
for not just the intended effects of our ideas,

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.000
but for their likely misuses.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:42.000
So it is important, I think, to Richard, and to me,

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:46.000
that these ideas not be abused and misused.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:49.000
They're very easy to misuse. That's why they're dangerous.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:52.000
And it's just about a full-time job

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:55.000
trying to prevent people who are scared of these ideas

00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:03.000
from caricaturing them and then running off to one dire purpose or another.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.000
So we have to keep plugging away,

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.000
trying to correct the misapprehensions

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:16.000
so that only the benign and useful variants of our ideas continue to spread.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.000
But it is a problem.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:25.000
We don't have much time, and I'm going to go over just a little bit of this and cut out,

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:28.000
because there's a lot of other things that are going to be said.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:33.000
So let me just point out: memes are like viruses.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.000
That's what Richard said, back in '93.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.000
And you might think, "Well, how can that be?

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:44.000
I mean, a virus is -- you know, it's stuff! What's a meme made of?"

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:49.000
Yesterday, Negroponte was talking about viral telecommunications

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:50.000
but -- what's a virus?

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:54.000
A virus is a string of nucleic acid with attitude.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:55.000
(Laughter)

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.000
That is, there is something about it

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:01.000
that tends to make it replicate better than the competition does.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:05.000
And that's what a meme is. It's an information packet with attitude.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:11.000
What's a meme made of? What are bits made of, Mom?

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.000
Not silicon.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:17.000
They're made of information, and can be carried in any physical medium.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.000
What's a word made of?

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:24.000
Sometimes when people say, "Do memes exist?"

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:28.000
I say, "Well, do words exist? Are they in your ontology?"

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:33.000
If they are, words are memes that can be pronounced.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.000
Then there's all the other memes that can't be pronounced.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.000
There are different species of memes.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:48.000
Remember the Shakers? Gift to be simple?

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.000
Simple, beautiful furniture?

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:54.000
And, of course, they're basically extinct now.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:09:00.000
And one of the reasons is that among the creed of Shaker-dom

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000
is that one should be celibate.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000
Not just the priests. Everybody.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:12.000
Well, it's not so surprising that they've gone extinct. (Laughter)

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.000
But in fact that's not why they went extinct.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:20.000
They survived as long as they did

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.000
at a time when the social safety nets weren't there.

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:25.000
And there were lots of widows and orphans,

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:28.000
people like that, who needed a foster home.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:31.000
And so they had a ready supply of converts.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.000
And they could keep it going.

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.000
And, in principle, it could've gone on forever,

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:38.000
with perfect celibacy on the part of the hosts.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:43.000
The idea being passed on through proselytizing,

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:46.000
instead of through the gene line.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:52.000
So the ideas can live on in spite of the fact

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:55.000
that they're not being passed on genetically.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:59.000
A meme can flourish in spite of having a negative impact on genetic fitness.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:07.000
After all, the meme for Shaker-dom was essentially a sterilizing parasite.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:14.000
There are other parasites that do this -- which render the host sterile.

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:17.000
It's part of their plan.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:21.000
They don't have to have minds to have a plan.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:27.000
I'm just going to draw your attention to just one

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:35.000
of the many implications of the memetic perspective, which I recommend.

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.000
I've not time to go into more of it.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:42.000
In Jared Diamond's wonderful book, "Guns, Germs and Steel,"

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:48.000
he talks about how it was germs, more than guns and steel,

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:53.000
that conquered the new hemisphere -- the Western hemisphere --

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.000
that conquered the rest of the world.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:11:02.000
When European explorers and travelers spread out,

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:04.000
they brought with them the germs

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:07.000
that they had become essentially immune to,

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:10.000
that they had learned how to tolerate over

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:13.000
hundreds and hundreds of years, thousands of years,

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:17.000
of living with domesticated animals who were the sources of those pathogens.

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:23.000
And they just wiped out -- these pathogens just wiped out the native people,

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:26.000
who had no immunity to them at all.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:29.000
And we're doing it again.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:34.000
We're doing it this time with toxic ideas.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:39.000
Yesterday, a number of people -- Nicholas Negroponte and others --

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.000
spoke about all the wonderful things

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:44.000
that are happening when our ideas get spread out,

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:46.000
thanks to all the new technology all over the world.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:52.000
And I agree. It is largely wonderful. Largely wonderful.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:12:00.000
But among all those ideas that inevitably flow out into the whole world

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:05.000
thanks to our technology, are a lot of toxic ideas.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:08.000
Now, this has been realized for some time.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:14.000
Sayyid Qutb is one of the founding fathers of fanatical Islam,

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:19.000
one of the ideologues that inspired Osama bin Laden.

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:24.000
"One has only to glance at its press films, fashion shows, beauty contests,

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:30.000
ballrooms, wine bars and broadcasting stations." Memes.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:34.000
These memes are spreading around the world

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:39.000
and they are wiping out whole cultures.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:41.000
They are wiping out languages.

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:46.000
They are wiping out traditions and practices.

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:54.000
And it's not our fault, anymore than it's our fault when our germs lay waste

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:57.000
to people that haven't developed the immunity.

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:03.000
We have an immunity to all of the junk that lies around the edges of our culture.

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:09.000
We're a free society, so we let pornography and all these things -- we shrug them off.

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:11.000
They're like a mild cold.

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:13.000
They're not a big deal for us.

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:17.000
But we should recognize that for many people in the world,

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:21.000
they are a big deal.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:24.000
And we should be very alert to this.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:27.000
As we spread our education and our technology,

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:35.000
one of the things that we are doing is we're the vectors of memes

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:41.000
that are correctly viewed by the hosts of many other memes

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:44.000
as a dire threat to their favorite memes --

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:47.000
the memes that they are prepared to die for.

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:51.000
Well now, how are we going to tell the good memes from the bad memes?

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:56.000
That is not the job of the science of memetics.

00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:02.000
Memetics is morally neutral. And so it should be.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:06.000
This is not the place for hate and anger.

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:11.000
If you've had a friend who's died of AIDS, then you hate HIV.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:15.000
But the way to deal with that is to do science,

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:22.000
and understand how it spreads and why in a morally neutral perspective.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:24.000
Get the facts.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:28.000
Work out the implications.

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:32.000
There's plenty of room for moral passion once we've got the facts

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.000
and can figure out the best thing to do.

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:39.000
And, as with germs, the trick is not to try to annihilate them.

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:42.000
You will never annihilate the germs.

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:48.000
What you can do, however, is foster public health measures and the like

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:53.000
that will encourage the evolution of avirulence.

00:14:54.000 --> 00:15:01.000
That will encourage the spread of relatively benign mutations

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:04.000
of the most toxic varieties.

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:07.000
That's all the time I have,

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:10.000
so thank you very much for your attention.
