00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
This is a representation of your brain,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
and your brain can be broken into two parts.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
There's the left half, which is the logical side,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
and then the right half,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
which is the intuitive.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
And so if we had a scale to measure the aptitude of each hemisphere,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
then we can plot our brain.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
And for example, this would be somebody who's completely logical.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
This would be someone who's entirely intuitive.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
So where would you put your brain on this scale?

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Some of us may have opted for one of these extremes,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
but I think for most people in the audience,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
your brain is something like this --

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
with a high aptitude in both hemispheres at the same time.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
It's not like they're mutually exclusive or anything.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
You can be logical and intuitive.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
And so I consider myself one of these people,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
along with most of the other experimental quantum physicists,

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
who need a good deal of logic

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
to string together these complex ideas.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
But at the same time, we need a good deal of intuition

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
to actually make the experiments work.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
How do we develop this intuition? Well we like to play with stuff.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
So we go out and play with it, and then we see how it acts,

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
and then we develop our intuition from there.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
And really you do the same thing.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
So some intuition

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
that you may have developed over the years

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.000
is that one thing is only in one place at a time.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
I mean, it can sound weird to think about

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.000
one thing being in two different places at the same time,

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
but you weren't born with this notion, you developed it.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
And I remember watching a kid playing on a car stop.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
He was just a toddler and he wasn't very good at it, and he kept falling over.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
But I bet playing with this car stop taught him a really valuable lesson,

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.000
and that's that large things don't let you get right past them,

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
and that they stay in one place.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
And so this is a great conceptual model to have of the world,

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
unless you're a particle physicist.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
It'd be a terrible model for a particle physicist,

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
because they don't play with car stops,

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
they play with these little weird particles.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
And when they play with their particles,

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
they find they do all sorts of really weird things --

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
like they can fly right through walls,

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000
or they can be in two different places at the same time.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
And so they wrote down all these observations,

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.000
and they called it the theory of quantum mechanics.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000
And so that's where physics was at a few years ago;

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
you needed quantum mechanics

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
to describe little, tiny particles.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
But you didn't need it

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000
to describe the large, everyday objects around us.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
This didn't really sit well with my intuition,

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
and maybe it's just because I don't play with particles very often.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
Well, I play with them sometimes,

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
but not very often.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
And I've never seen them.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
I mean, nobody's ever seen a particle.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
But it didn't sit well with my logical side either.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
Because if everything is made up of little particles

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
and all the little particles

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
follow quantum mechanics,

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000
then shouldn't everything just follow quantum mechanics?

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
I don't see any reason why it shouldn't.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
And so I'd feel a lot better about the whole thing

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
if we could somehow show

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000
that an everyday object

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000
also follows quantum mechanics.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000
So a few years ago, I set off to do just that.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000
So I made one.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000
This is the first object

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
that you can see

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000
that has been in a mechanical quantum superposition.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000
So what we're looking at here

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000
is a tiny computer chip.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.000
And you can sort of see this green dot right in the middle.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.000
And that's this piece of metal I'm going to be talking about in a minute.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
This is a photograph of the object.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000
And here I'll zoom in a little bit. We're looking right there in the center.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000
And then here's a really, really big close-up of the little piece of metal.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000
So what we're looking at is a little chunk of metal,

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.000
and it's shaped like a diving board, and it's sticking out over a ledge.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000
And so I made this thing

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000
in nearly the same way as you make a computer chip.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000
I went into a clean room with a fresh silicon wafer,

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.000
and then I just cranked away at all the big machines for about 100 hours.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000
For the last stuff, I had to build my own machine --

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.000
to make this swimming pool-shaped hole

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000
underneath the device.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000
This device has the ability

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
to be in a quantum superposition,

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000
but it needs a little help to do it.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000
Here, let me give you an analogy.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000
You know how uncomfortable it is to be in a crowded elevator?

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000
I mean, when I'm in an elevator all alone, I do all sorts of weird things,

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000
but then other people get on board

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000
and I stop doing those things

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000
because I don't want to bother them,

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.000
or, frankly, scare them.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000
So quantum mechanics says

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.000
that inanimate objects feel the same way.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
The fellow passengers for inanimate objects

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
are not just people,

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
but it's also the light shining on it

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.000
and the wind blowing past it and the heat of the room.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000
And so we knew, if we wanted to see

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.000
this piece of metal behave quantum mechanically,

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000
we're going to have to kick out all the other passengers.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000
And so that's what we did.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000
We turned off the lights,

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000
and then we put it in a vacuum and sucked out all the air,

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000
and then we cooled it down

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
to just a fraction of a degree above absolute zero.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000
Now, all alone in the elevator,

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000
the little chunk of metal is free to act however it wanted.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000
And so we measured its motion.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000
We found it was moving in really weird ways.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000
Instead of just sitting perfectly still, it was vibrating,

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000
and the way it was vibrating was breathing something like this --

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000
like expanding and contracting bellows.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000
And by giving it a gentle nudge,

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000
we were able to make it both vibrate

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000
and not vibrate

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000
at the same time --

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.000
something that's only allowed with quantum mechanics.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.000
So what I'm telling you here is something truly fantastic.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000
What does it mean for one thing

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000
to be both vibrating and not vibrating

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000
at the same time?

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000
So let's think about the atoms.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000
So in one case:

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.000
all the trillions of atoms that make up that chunk of metal

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000
are sitting still

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000
and at the same time those same atoms

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000
are moving up and down.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.000
Now it's only at precise times when they align.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000
The rest of the time they're delocalized.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.000
That means that every atom

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000
is in two different places at the same time,

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.000
which in turn means the entire chunk of metal

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.000
is in two different places.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000
I think this is really cool.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.000
(Laughter)

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000
Really.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.000
(Applause)

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:09.000
It was worth locking myself in a clean room to do this for all those years

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.000
because, check this out,

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.000
the difference in scale

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000
between a single atom and that chunk of metal

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000
is about the same as the difference

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.000
between that chunk of metal and you.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.000
So if a single atom can be in two different places at the same time,

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.000
that chunk of metal can be in two different places,

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000
then why not you?

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.000
I mean, this is just my logical side talking.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:35.000
So imagine if you're in multiple places at the same time,

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.000
what would that be like?

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.000
How would your consciousness

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:44.000
handle your body being delocalized in space?

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.000
There's one more part to the story.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.000
It's when we warmed it up,

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.000
and we turned on the lights and looked inside the box,

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:55.000
we saw that the piece metal was still there in one piece.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.000
And so I had to develop this new intuition,

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:01.000
that it seems like all the objects in the elevator

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.000
are really just quantum objects

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.000
just crammed into a tiny space.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.000
You hear a lot of talk

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:10.000
about how quantum mechanics says that everything is all interconnected.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.000
Well, that's not quite right.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.000
It's more than that; it's deeper.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.000
It's that those connections,

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.000
your connections to all the things around you,

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:23.000
literally define who you are,

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:26.000
and that's the profound weirdness of quantum mechanics.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.000
Thank you.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000
(Applause)
