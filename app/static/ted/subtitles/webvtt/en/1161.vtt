00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
I'm Jessi, and this is my suitcase.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
But before I show you what I've got inside,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
I'm going to make a very public confession,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
and that is,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
I'm outfit-obsessed.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
I love finding, wearing,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
and more recently,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
photographing and blogging

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
a different, colorful, crazy outfit

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
for every single occasion.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
But I don't buy anything new.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
I get all my clothes secondhand

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
from flea markets and thrift stores.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Aww, thank you.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Secondhand shopping

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
allows me to reduce the impact

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
my wardrobe has on the environment

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
and on my wallet.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
I get to meet all kinds of great people;

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
my dollars usually go to a good cause;

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
I look pretty unique;

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
and it makes shopping like my own personal treasure hunt.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
I mean, what am I going to find today?

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
Is it going to be my size?

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
Will I like the color?

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
Will it be under $20?

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
If all the answers are yes,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
I feel as though I've won.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
I want to get back to my suitcase

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
and tell you what I packed

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
for this exciting week here at TED.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
I mean, what does somebody with all these outfits bring with her?

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
So I'm going to show you exactly what I brought.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
I brought seven pairs of underpants

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
and that's it.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
Exactly one week's worth of undies

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
is all I put in my suitcase.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
I was betting that I'd be able to find

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
everything else I could possible want to wear

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
once I got here to Palm Springs.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
And since you don't know me

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
as the woman walking around TED in her underwear --

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
(Laughter)

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
that means I found a few things.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
And I'd really love to show you my week's worth of outfits right now.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
Does that sound good?

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
(Applause)

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
So as I do this,

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
I'm also going to tell you a few of the life lessons

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
that, believe it or not, I have picked up

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
in these adventures wearing nothing new.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
So let's start with Sunday.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
I call this "Shiny Tiger."

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.000
You do not have to spend a lot of money to look great.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000
You can almost always look phenomenal for under $50.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
This whole outfit, including the jacket,

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
cost me $55,

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
and it was the most expensive thing

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
that I wore the entire week.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000
Monday: Color is powerful.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000
It is almost physiologically impossible

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000
to be in a bad mood when you're wearing bright red pants.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
(Laughter)

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
If you are happy,

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
you are going to attract other happy people to you.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
Tuesday:

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000
Fitting in is way overrated.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
I've spent a whole lot of my life

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
trying to be myself

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
and at the same time fit in.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000
Just be who you are.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.000
If you are surrounding yourself with the right people,

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
they will not only get it,

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
they will appreciate it.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
Wednesday:

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000
Embrace your inner child.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000
Sometimes people tell me

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000
that I look like I'm playing dress-up,

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.000
or that I remind them of their seven-year-old.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000
I like to smile

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
and say, "Thank you."

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
Thursday:

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
Confidence is key.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
If you think you look good in something,

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000
you almost certainly do.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000
And if you don't think you look good in something,

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
you're also probably right.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.000
I grew up with a mom who taught me this day-in and day-out.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000
But it wasn't until I turned 30

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000
that I really got what this meant.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000
And I'm going to break it down for you for just a second.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.000
If you believe you're a beautiful person

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.000
inside and out,

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000
there is no look that you can't pull off.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000
So there is no excuse for any of us here in this audience.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.000
We should be able to rock anything we want to rock.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000
Thank you.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
(Applause)

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
Friday: A universal truth -- five words for you:

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:05.000
Gold sequins go with everything.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.000
And finally, Saturday:

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000
Developing your own unique personal style

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.000
is a really great way to tell the world something about you

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000
without having to say a word.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000
It's been proven to me time and time again

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000
as people have walked up to me this week

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000
simply because of what I'm wearing,

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000
and we've had great conversations.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.000
So obviously this is not all going to fit

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000
back in my tiny suitcase.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000
So before I go home to Brooklyn,

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000
I'm going to donate everything back.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.000
Because the lesson I'm trying to learn myself this week

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.000
is that it's okay to let go.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000
I don't need to get emotionally attached to these things

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000
because around the corner,

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000
there is always going to be

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000
another crazy, colorful,

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000
shiny outfit

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000
just waiting for me,

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000
if I put a little love in my heart and look.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000
Thank you very much.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.000
(Applause)

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000
Thank you.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:03.000
(Applause)
