00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
When I was growing up in Montana,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
I had two dreams.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
I wanted to be a paleontologist,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
a dinosaur paleontologist,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
and I wanted to have a pet dinosaur.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
And so that's what I've been striving for

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
all of my life.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
I was very fortunate

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
early in my career.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
I was fortunate

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
in finding things.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
I wasn't very good at reading things.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
In fact, I don't read much of anything.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
I am extremely dyslexic,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
and so reading is the hardest thing I do.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
But instead, I go out and I find things.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
Then I just pick things up.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
I basically practice for finding money on the street.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
(Laughter)

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
And I wander about the hills,

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
and I have found a few things.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
And I have been fortunate enough

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.000
to find things like the first eggs in the Western hemisphere

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000
and the first baby dinosaurs in nests,

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
the first dinosaur embryos

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000
and massive accumulations of bones.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
And it happened to be at a time

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000
when people were just starting to begin to realize

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.000
that dinosaurs weren't the big, stupid, green reptiles

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
that people had thought for so many years.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
People were starting to get an idea

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
that dinosaurs were special.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
And so, at that time,

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
I was able to make some interesting hypotheses

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
along with my colleagues.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
We were able to actually say

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
that dinosaurs -- based on the evidence we had --

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
that dinosaurs built nests

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
and lived in colonies

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
and cared for their young,

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
brought food to their babies

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
and traveled in gigantic herds.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
So it was pretty interesting stuff.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
I have gone on to find more things

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000
and discover that dinosaurs really were very social.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
We have found a lot of evidence

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
that dinosaurs changed

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
from when they were juveniles to when they were adults.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000
The appearance of them would have been different --

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
which it is in all social animals.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
In social groups of animals,

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
the juveniles always look different than the adults.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
The adults can recognize the juveniles;

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
the juveniles can recognize the adults.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000
And so we're making a better picture

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
of what a dinosaur looks like.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
And they didn't just all chase Jeeps around.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
(Laughter)

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000
But it is that social thing

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.000
that I guess attracted Michael Crichton.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.000
And in his book, he talked about the social animals.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
And then Steven Spielberg, of course,

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
depicts these dinosaurs

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000
as being very social creatures.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
The theme of this story is building a dinosaur,

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.000
and so we come to that part of "Jurassic Park."

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000
Michael Crichton really was one of the first people

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.000
to talk about bringing dinosaurs back to life.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
You all know the story, right.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000
I mean, I assume everyone here has seen "Jurassic Park."

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000
If you want to make a dinosaur,

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.000
you go out, you find yourself a piece of petrified tree sap --

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
otherwise known as amber --

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000
that has some blood-sucking insects in it,

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
good ones,

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000
and you get your insect and you drill into it

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000
and you suck out some DNA,

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.000
because obviously all insects that sucked blood in those days

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000
sucked dinosaur DNA out.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000
And you take your DNA back to the laboratory

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.000
and you clone it.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.000
And I guess you inject it into maybe an ostrich egg,

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000
or something like that,

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000
and then you wait,

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.000
and, lo and behold, out pops a little baby dinosaur.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000
And everybody's happy about that.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
(Laughter)

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
And they're happy over and over again.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.000
They keep doing it; they just keep making these things.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.000
And then, then, then, and then ...

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000
Then the dinosaurs, being social,

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000
act out their socialness,

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000
and they get together,

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.000
and they conspire.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:21.000
And, of course, that's what makes Steven Spielberg's movie --

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000
conspiring dinosaurs chasing people around.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000
So I assume everybody knows

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.000
that if you actually had a piece of amber and it had an insect in it,

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.000
and you drilled into it,

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000
and you got something out of that insect,

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.000
and you cloned it, and you did it over and over and over again,

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000
you'd have a room full of mosquitos.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000
(Laughter)

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:46.000
(Applause)

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.000
And probably a whole bunch of trees as well.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000
Now if you want dinosaur DNA,

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000
I say go to the dinosaur.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000
So that's what we've done.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000
Back in 1993 when the movie came out,

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.000
we actually had a grant from the National Science Foundation

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.000
to attempt to extract DNA from a dinosaur,

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.000
and we chose the dinosaur on the left,

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.000
a Tyrannosaurus rex, which was a very nice specimen.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000
And one of my former doctoral students,

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000
Dr. Mary Schweitzer,

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000
actually had the background

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000
to do this sort of thing.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.000
And so she looked into the bone of this T. rex,

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000
one of the thigh bones,

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000
and she actually found

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.000
some very interesting structures in there.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:32.000
They found these red circular-looking objects,

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.000
and they looked, for all the world,

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000
like red blood cells.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.000
And they're in

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000
what appear to be the blood channels

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000
that go through the bone.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.000
And so she thought, well, what the heck.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.000
So she sampled some material out of it.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.000
Now it wasn't DNA; she didn't find DNA.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.000
But she did find heme,

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000
which is the biological foundation

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000
of hemoglobin.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000
And that was really cool.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000
That was interesting.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:07.000
That was -- here we have 65-million-year-old heme.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.000
Well we tried and tried

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.000
and we couldn't really get anything else out of it.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.000
So a few years went by,

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000
and then we started the Hell Creek Project.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.000
And the Hell Creek Project was this massive undertaking

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.000
to get as many dinosaurs as we could possibly find,

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.000
and hopefully find some dinosaurs

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.000
that had more material in them.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.000
And out in eastern Montana

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000
there's a lot of space, a lot of badlands,

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.000
and not very many people,

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.000
and so you can go out there and find a lot of stuff.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.000
And we did find a lot of stuff.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000
We found a lot of Tyrannosaurs,

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.000
but we found one special Tyrannosaur,

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.000
and we called it B-rex.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.000
And B-rex was found

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000
under a thousand cubic yards of rock.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.000
It wasn't a very complete T. rex,

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.000
and it wasn't a very big T. rex,

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.000
but it was a very special B-rex.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.000
And I and my colleagues cut into it,

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000
and we were able to determine,

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.000
by looking at lines of arrested growth, some lines in it,

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.000
that B-rex had died at the age of 16.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.000
We don't really know how long dinosaurs lived,

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000
because we haven't found the oldest one yet.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.000
But this one died at the age of 16.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.000
We gave samples to Mary Schweitzer,

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.000
and she was actually able to determine

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.000
that B-rex was a female

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.000
based on medullary tissue

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.000
found on the inside of the bone.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.000
Medullary tissue is the calcium build-up,

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000
the calcium storage basically,

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000
when an animal is pregnant,

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.000
when a bird is pregnant.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.000
So here was the character

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.000
that linked birds and dinosaurs.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.000
But Mary went further.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.000
She took the bone, and she dumped it into acid.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:45.000
Now we all know that bones are fossilized,

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.000
and so if you dump it into acid,

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.000
there shouldn't be anything left.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.000
But there was something left.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:54.000
There were blood vessels left.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:58.000
There were flexible, clear blood vessels.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:01.000
And so here was the first soft tissue from a dinosaur.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.000
It was extraordinary.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.000
But she also found osteocytes,

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:09.000
which are the cells that laid down the bones.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:13.000
And try and try, we could not find DNA,

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:16.000
but she did find evidence of proteins.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:19.000
But we thought maybe --

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.000
well, we thought maybe

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:24.000
that the material was breaking down after it was coming out of the ground.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000
We thought maybe it was deteriorating very fast.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000
And so we built a laboratory

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.000
in the back of an 18-wheeler trailer,

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:34.000
and actually took the laboratory to the field

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.000
where we could get better samples.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.000
And we did. We got better material.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.000
The cells looked better.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.000
The vessels looked better.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.000
Found the protein collagen.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:48.000
I mean, it was wonderful stuff.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:52.000
But it's not dinosaur DNA.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.000
So we have discovered

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.000
that dinosaur DNA, and all DNA,

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.000
just breaks down too fast.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.000
We're just not going to be able

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.000
to do what they did in "Jurassic Park."

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:06.000
We're not going to be able to make a dinosaur

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:09.000
based on a dinosaur.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:13.000
But birds are dinosaurs.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:17.000
Birds are living dinosaurs.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.000
We actually classify them

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.000
as dinosaurs.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.000
We now call them non-avian dinosaurs

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.000
and avian dinosaurs.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.000
So the non-avian dinosaurs

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.000
are the big clunky ones that went extinct.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:32.000
Avian dinosaurs are our modern birds.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.000
So we don't have to make a dinosaur

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:37.000
because we already have them.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:43.000
(Laughter)

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:47.000
I know, you're as bad as the sixth-graders.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.000
(Laughter)

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:52.000
The sixth-graders look at it and they say, "No."

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.000
(Laughter)

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.000
"You can call it a dinosaur,

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:59.000
but look at the velociraptor: the velociraptor is cool."

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.000
(Laughter)

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.000
"The chicken is not."

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.000
(Laughter)

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.000
So this is our problem,

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:10.000
as you can imagine.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.000
The chicken is a dinosaur.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.000
I mean it really is.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.000
You can't argue with it

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:19.000
because we're the classifiers and we've classified it that way.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.000
(Laughter)

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:25.000
(Applause)

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.000
But the sixth-graders demand it.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.000
"Fix the chicken."

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.000
(Laughter)

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.000
So that's what I'm here to tell you about:

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:37.000
how we are going to fix a chicken.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:40.000
So we have a number of ways

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:45.000
that we actually can fix the chicken.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.000
Because evolution works,

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:50.000
we actually have some evolutionary tools.

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:53.000
We'll call them biological modification tools.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.000
We have selection.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.000
And we know selection works.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:00.000
We started out with a wolf-like creature

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:03.000
and we ended up with a Maltese.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:06.000
I mean, that's --

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:10.000
that's definitely genetic modification.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:14.000
Or any of the other funny-looking little dogs.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.000
We also have transgenesis.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.000
Transgenesis is really cool too.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:22.000
That's where you take a gene out of one animal and stick it in another one.

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:25.000
That's how people make GloFish.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:28.000
You take a glow gene

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:32.000
out of a coral or a jellyfish

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.000
and you stick it in a zebrafish,

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.000
and, puff, they glow.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.000
And that's pretty cool.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:41.000
And they obviously make a lot of money off of them.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:43.000
And now they're making Glow-rabbits

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.000
and Glow-all-sorts-of-things.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:48.000
I guess we could make a glow chicken.

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.000
(Laughter)

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:53.000
But I don't think that'll satisfy the sixth-graders either.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.000
But there's another thing.

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:58.000
There's what we call atavism activation.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.000
And atavism activation

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.000
is basically --

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:06.000
an atavism is an ancestral characteristic.

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.000
You heard

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:11.000
that occasionally children are born with tails,

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:15.000
and it's because it's an ancestral characteristic.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:18.000
And so there are a number of atavisms

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.000
that can happen.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:23.000
Snakes are occasionally born with legs.

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:25.000
And here's an example.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:28.000
This is a chicken with teeth.

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.000
A fellow by the name of Matthew Harris

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:33.000
at the University of Wisconsin in Madison

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:36.000
actually figured out a way to stimulate

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:39.000
the gene for teeth,

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:42.000
and so was able to actually turn the tooth gene on

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:45.000
and produce teeth in chickens.

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:48.000
Now that's a good characteristic.

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:51.000
We can save that one.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.000
We know we can use that.

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:56.000
We can make a chicken with teeth.

00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:59.000
That's getting closer.

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.000
That's better than a glowing chicken.

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:03.000
(Laughter)

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:05.000
A friend of mine, a colleague of mine,

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:07.000
Dr. Hans Larsson at McGill University,

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:09.000
is actually looking at atavisms.

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:11.000
And he's looking at them

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:14.000
by looking at the embryo genesis of birds

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:17.000
and actually looking at how they develop,

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:21.000
and he's interested in how birds actually lost their tail.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.000
He's also interested in the transformation

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:26.000
of the arm, the hand, to the wing.

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:28.000
He's looking for those genes as well.

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:31.000
And I said, "Well, if you can find those,

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.000
I can just reverse them

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:36.000
and make what I need to make for the sixth-graders."

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.000
And so he agreed.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.000
And so that's what we're looking into.

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:42.000
If you look at dinosaur hands,

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.000
a velociraptor

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:46.000
has that cool-looking hand with the claws on it.

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:49.000
Archaeopteryx, which is a bird, a primitive bird,

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:52.000
still has that very primitive hand.

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:54.000
But as you can see, the pigeon,

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.000
or a chicken or anything else, another bird,

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:59.000
has kind of a weird-looking hand,

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:01.000
because the hand is a wing.

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:03.000
But the cool thing is

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:06.000
that, if you look in the embryo,

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:08.000
as the embryo is developing

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:11.000
the hand actually looks

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:13.000
pretty much like the archaeopteryx hand.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:16.000
It has the three fingers, the three digits.

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:19.000
But a gene turns on that actually fuses those together.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:22.000
And so what we're looking for is that gene.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:24.000
We want to stop that gene from turning on,

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.000
fusing those hands together,

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:29.000
so we can get a chicken that hatches out with a three-fingered hand,

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:31.000
like the archaeopteryx.

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:34.000
And the same goes for the tails.

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:37.000
Birds have basically

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.000
rudimentary tails.

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:42.000
And so we know

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:44.000
that in embryo,

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.000
as the animal is developing,

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:49.000
it actually has a relatively long tail.

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:51.000
But a gene turns on

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:54.000
and resorbs the tail, gets rid of it.

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:57.000
So that's the other gene we're looking for.

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:01.000
We want to stop that tail from resorbing.

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:04.000
So what we're trying to do really

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:07.000
is take our chicken,

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:09.000
modify it

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:11.000
and make the chickenosaurus.

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:14.000
(Laughter)

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:17.000
It's a cooler-looking chicken.

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:20.000
But it's just the very basics.

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:22.000
So that really is what we're doing.

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:24.000
And people always say, "Why do that?

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:26.000
Why make this thing?

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:28.000
What good is it?"

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:30.000
Well, that's a good question.

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:32.000
Actually, I think it's a great way to teach kids

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:34.000
about evolutionary biology

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:36.000
and developmental biology

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:38.000
and all sorts of things.

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:41.000
And quite frankly, I think

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:43.000
if Colonel Sanders

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:46.000
was to be careful how he worded it,

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:49.000
he could actually advertise an extra piece.

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:53.000
(Laughter)

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:55.000
Anyway --

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:01.000
When our dino-chicken hatches,

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:04.000
it will be, obviously, the poster child,

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:07.000
or what you might call a poster chick,

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:10.000
for technology, entertainment and design.

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:12.000
Thank you.

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:15.000
(Applause)
