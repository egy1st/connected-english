00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
This story

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
is about taking imagination seriously.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Fourteen years ago,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
I first encountered this ordinary material, fishnet,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
used the same way for centuries.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Today, I'm using it to create

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
permanent, billowing, voluptuous forms

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
the scale of hard-edged buildings

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
in cities around the world.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
I was an unlikely person to be doing this.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
I never studied sculpture,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
engineering or architecture.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
In fact, after college

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
I applied to seven art schools

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
and was rejected by all seven.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
I went off on my own to become an artist,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
and I painted for 10 years,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
when I was offered a Fulbright to India.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
Promising to give exhibitions of paintings,

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
I shipped my paints and arrived in Mahabalipuram.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
The deadline for the show arrived --

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
my paints didn't.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
I had to do something.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
This fishing village was famous for sculpture.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
So I tried bronze casting.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
But to make large forms was too heavy and expensive.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
I went for a walk on the beach,

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
watching the fishermen

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
bundle their nets into mounds on the sand.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
I'd seen it every day,

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
but this time I saw it differently --

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
a new approach to sculpture,

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
a way to make volumetric form

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
without heavy solid materials.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
My first satisfying sculpture

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
was made in collaboration with these fishermen.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
It's a self-portrait

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
titled "Wide Hips."

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
(Laughter)

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
We hoisted them on poles to photograph.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
I discovered

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
their soft surfaces

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
revealed every ripple of wind

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
in constantly changing patterns.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000
I was mesmerized.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
I continued studying craft traditions

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
and collaborating with artisans,

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
next in Lithuania with lace makers.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
I liked the fine detail

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
it gave my work,

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
but I wanted to make them larger --

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
to shift from being an object you look at

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
to something you could get lost in.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
Returning to India to work with those fishermen,

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
we made a net

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
of a million and a half hand-tied knots --

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000
installed briefly in Madrid.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
Thousands of people saw it,

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
and one of them was the urbanist

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
Manual Sola-Morales

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
who was redesigning the waterfront

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000
in Porto, Portugal.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
He asked if I could build this

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
as a permanent piece for the city.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000
I didn't know if I could do that

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
and preserve my art.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
Durable, engineered, permanent --

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
those are in opposition

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000
to idiosyncratic, delicate and ephemeral.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
For two years, I searched for a fiber

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
that could survive ultraviolet rays,

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000
salt, air, pollution,

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
and at the same time remain soft enough

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000
to move fluidly in the wind.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
We needed something to hold the net up

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
out there in the middle of the traffic circle.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:13.000
So we raised this 45,000-pound steel ring.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
We had to engineer it

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
to move gracefully in an average breeze

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000
and survive in hurricane winds.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.000
But there was no engineering software

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.000
to model something porous and moving.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
I found a brilliant aeronautical engineer

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000
who designs sails for America's Cup racing yachts

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000
named Peter Heppel.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000
He helped me tackle the twin challenges

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000
of precise shape

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.000
and gentle movement.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000
I couldn't build this the way I knew

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000
because hand-tied knots

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000
weren't going to withstand a hurricane.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000
So I developed a relationship

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000
with an industrial fishnet factory,

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000
learned the variables of their machines,

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000
and figured out a way

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
to make lace with them.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
There was no language

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.000
to translate this ancient, idiosyncratic handcraft

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000
into something machine operators could produce.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000
So we had to create one.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.000
Three years and two children later,

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.000
we raised this 50,000-square-foot lace net.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000
It was hard to believe

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000
that what I had imagined

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.000
was now built, permanent

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.000
and had lost nothing in translation.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:34.000
(Applause)

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.000
This intersection had been bland and anonymous.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.000
Now it had a sense of place.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000
I walked underneath it

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000
for the first time.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.000
As I watched the wind's choreography unfold,

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000
I felt sheltered

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000
and, at the same time,

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000
connected to limitless sky.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.000
My life was not going to be the same.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.000
I want to create these oases of sculpture

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.000
in spaces of cities around the world.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000
I'm going to share two directions

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.000
that are new in my work.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000
Historic Philadelphia City Hall:

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:21.000
its plaza, I felt, needed a material for sculpture

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000
that was lighter than netting.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000
So we experimented

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000
with tiny atomized water particles

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000
to create a dry mist

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000
that is shaped by the wind

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.000
and in testing, discovered

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.000
that it can be shaped by people

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.000
who can interact and move through it without getting wet.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.000
I'm using this sculpture material

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:45.000
to trace the paths of subway trains above ground

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.000
in real time --

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:52.000
like an X-ray of the city's circulatory system unfolding.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000
Next challenge,

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000
the Biennial of the Americas in Denver

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000
asked, could I represent

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.000
the 35 nations of the Western hemisphere and their interconnectedness

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000
in a sculpture?

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.000
(Laughter)

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000
I didn't know where to begin,

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000
but I said yes.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.000
I read about the recent earthquake in Chile

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.000
and the tsunami that rippled across

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.000
the entire Pacific Ocean.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.000
It shifted the Earth's tectonic plates,

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000
sped up the planet's rotation

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.000
and literally shortened the length of the day.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.000
So I contacted NOAA,

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.000
and I asked if they'd share their data on the tsunami,

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.000
and translated it into this.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:43.000
Its title: "1.26"

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.000
refers to the number of microseconds

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.000
that the Earth's day was shortened.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.000
I couldn't build this with a steel ring, the way I knew.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.000
Its shape was too complex now.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000
So I replaced the metal armature

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.000
with a soft, fine mesh

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:02.000
of a fiber 15 times stronger than steel.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:06.000
The sculpture could now be entirely soft,

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.000
which made it so light

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:11.000
it could tie in to existing buildings --

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.000
literally becoming part of the fabric of the city.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.000
There was no software

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:19.000
that could extrude these complex net forms

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.000
and model them with gravity.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.000
So we had to create it.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.000
Then I got a call from New York City

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.000
asking if I could adapt these concepts

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000
to Times Square

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.000
or the High Line.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:37.000
This new soft structural method

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.000
enables me to model these

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.000
and build these sculptures

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:44.000
at the scale of skyscrapers.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.000
They don't have funding yet,

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.000
but I dream now

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:51.000
of bringing these to cities around the world

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:54.000
where they're most needed.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.000
Fourteen years ago,

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:00.000
I searched for beauty

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000
in the traditional things,

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:05.000
in craft forms.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:11.000
Now I combine them with hi-tech materials and engineering

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:14.000
to create voluptuous, billowing forms

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:17.000
the scale of buildings.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:20.000
My artistic horizons continue to grow.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:23.000
I'll leave you with this story.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:26.000
I got a call from a friend in Phoenix.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000
An attorney in the office

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.000
who'd never been interested in art,

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.000
never visited the local art museum,

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.000
dragged everyone she could from the building

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.000
and got them outside to lie down underneath the sculpture.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.000
There they were in their business suits,

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.000
laying in the grass,

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.000
noticing the changing patterns of wind

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.000
beside people they didn't know,

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:50.000
sharing the rediscovery of wonder.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.000
Thank you.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:56.000
(Applause)

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.000
Thank you. Thank you.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.000
Thank you.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.000
Thank you. Thank you.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.000
(Applause)
