00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
In 2007,

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
I decided that we needed to reconceptualize

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
how we thought about economic development.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Our new goal should be

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
that when every family thinks about where they want to live and work,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
they should be able to choose between

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
at least a handful

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
of different cities

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
that were all competing to attract new residents.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Now we're a long way away from that goal right now.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
There are billions of people in developing countries

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
who don't have even a single city that would be willing to welcome them.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
But the amazing thing about cities

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
is they're worth so much more

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
than it costs to build them.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
So we could easily supply the world

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
with dozens, maybe hundreds,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
of new cities.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
Now this might sound preposterous to you

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
if you've never thought about new cities.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
But just substitute apartment building for cities.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
Imagine half the people who wanted to be in apartments already had them;

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
the other half aren't there yet.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
You could try and expand the capacity

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
by doing additions on all the existing apartments.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
But you know what you'd run into

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
is those apartments and the surrounding areas

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
have rules to avoid discomfort

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
and the distractions of construction.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
So it's extremely hard to do all of those additions.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
But you could go out someplace brand new,

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
build a brand new apartment building,

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
as long as the rules there

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
were ones that facilitated construction

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
rather than getting in the way.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
So I proposed

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
that governments create new reform zones

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
big enough to hold cities

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
and gave them a name: charter cities.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
Later I learned that at about this same time,

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
Javier and Octavio

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
were thinking about the challenge of reform

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
in Honduras.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.000
They knew that about 75,000 Hondurans every year

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
would leave to go to the United States,

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
and they wanted to ask, what could they do

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
to make sure that those people could stay

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000
and do the same things in Honduras.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
At one point, Javier said to Octavio,

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
"What if we took some of our empty land --

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
what if we just gave it to an embassy --

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
give some to the U.S. embassy; give some to the Canadian embassy --

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
and then if people want to go work

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
under the rules of Canada or under the rules of the United States,

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
they can go get jobs,

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
do everything they do on those embassy grounds

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.000
that they would otherwise have to go to Canada or the U.S. to do?"

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
In the summer of 2009,

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000
Honduras went through a wrenching constitutional crisis.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000
At the next regularly scheduled election,

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
Pepe Lobo won in a landslide

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
on a platform that promised reform,

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
but reconciliation as well.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
He asked Octavio to be his chief of staff.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
Meanwhile, I was getting ready

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
to give a talk at TEDGlobal.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000
Through a process of refinement,

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000
trial and error, a lot of user testing,

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000
I tried to boil this complicated concept of charter city

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000
down to the bare essentials.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000
The first point was the importance of rules,

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
like those rules that say

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
you can't come in and disturb all the existing apartment holders.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
We pay a lot of attention to new technologies,

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000
but it takes technologies and rules to get progress,

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000
and it's usually the rules that hold us back.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
In the fall of 2010, a friend from Guatemala

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000
sent Octavio a link to the TEDTalk.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
He showed it to Javier.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
They called me.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000
They said, "Let's present this to the leaders of our country."

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000
So in December we met in Miami,

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
in a hotel conference room.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
I tried to explain this point

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
about how valuable cities are,

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
how much more valuable they are than they cost.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
And I used this slide

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000
showing how valuable the raw land is

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000
in a place like New York City:

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000
notice, land that's worth thousands of dollars, in some cases,

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000
per square meter.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.000
But it was a fairly abstract discussion,

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000
and at some point when there was a pause,

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000
Octavio said,

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.000
"Paul, maybe we could watch the TEDTalk."

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000
(Laughing)

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
So the TEDTalk laid out in very simple terms,

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
a charter city is a place

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.000
where you start with uninhabited land,

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.000
a charter that specifies the rules that will apply there

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000
and then a chance for people to opt in,

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.000
to go live under those rules or not.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.000
So I was asked by the president of Honduras

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000
who said that we need to do this project,

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000
this is important,

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.000
this could be the way forward for our country.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000
I was asked to come to Tegucigalpa

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.000
and talk again on January fourth and fifth.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
So I presented

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
another fact-filled lecture

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
that included a slide like this,

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.000
which tried to make the point that, if you want to create a lot of value in a city,

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000
it has to be very big.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000
This is a picture of Denver,

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000
and the outline is the new airport that was built in Denver.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000
This airport alone

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000
covers more than 100 square kilometers.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000
So I was trying to persuade the Hondurans,

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000
if you build a new city,

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.000
you've got to start with a site that's at least 1,000 square kilometers.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.000
That's more than 250 hundred-thousand acres.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000
Everybody applauded politely.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000
The faces in the audience

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.000
were very serious and attentive.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.000
The leader of the congress came up on stage and said,

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.000
"Professor Romer, thank you very much for your lecture,

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.000
but maybe we could watch the TEDTalk.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.000
I've got it here on my laptop."

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.000
So I sat down, and they played the TEDTalk.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000
And it got to the essence,

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.000
which is that a new city could offer new choices for people.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000
There would be a choice of a city which you could go to

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000
which could be in Honduras,

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000
instead of hundreds of miles away in the North.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.000
And it also involved new choices for leaders.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.000
Because the leaders in the government there in Honduras

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000
would need help from partner countries,

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000
who could benefit from partner countries

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.000
who help them set up the rules in this charter and the enforcement,

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000
so everybody can trust

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.000
that the charter really will be enforced.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000
And the insight of President Lobo

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.000
was that that assurance of enforcement

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000
that I was thinking about

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.000
as a way to get the foreign investors to come in and build the city

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.000
could be equally important for all the different parties in Honduras

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.000
who had suffered for so many years

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.000
from fear and distrust.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000
We went and looked at a site.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000
This picture's from there.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.000
It easily could hold a thousand square kilometers.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.000
And shortly thereafter, on January 19th,

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.000
they voted in the congress to amend their constitution

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.000
to have a constitutional provision

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.000
that allows for special development regions.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.000
In a country which had just gone through this wrenching crisis,

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.000
the vote in the congress in favor of this constitutional amendment

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.000
was 124 to one.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.000
All parties, all factions in society, backed this.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.000
To be part of the constitution, you actually have to pass it twice in the congress.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.000
On February 17th they passed it again

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.000
with another vote of 114 to one.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.000
Immediately after that vote,

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:49.000
on February 21st to the 24th,

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000
a delegation of about 30 Hondurans

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000
went to the two places in the world

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000
that are most interested in getting into the city building business.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.000
One is South Korea.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.000
This is a picture of a big, new city center

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000
that's being built in South Korea --

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.000
bigger than downtown Boston.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.000
Everything you see there was built in four years,

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:08.000
after they spent four years getting the permits.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000
The other place that's very interested in city building is Singapore.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.000
They've actually built two cities already in China

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000
and are preparing the third.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.000
So if you think about this practically,

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.000
here's where we are.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:22.000
They've got a site; they're already thinking about this site for the second city.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.000
They're putting in place a legal system

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.000
that could allow for managers to come in,

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.000
and also an external legal system.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:31.000
One country has already volunteered to let its supreme court

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:34.000
be the court of final appeal for the new judicial system there.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000
There's designers and builders of cities

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.000
who are very interested.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.000
They even can bring with them some financing.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.000
But the one thing you know they've already solved

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.000
is that there's lots of tenants.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:47.000
There's lots of businesses that would like to locate in the Americas,

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.000
especially in a place with a free trade zone,

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:52.000
and there's lots of people who'd like to go there.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000
Around the world, there's 700 million people

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.000
who say they'd like to move permanently someplace else right now.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.000
There's a million a year

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.000
who leave Latin America to go to the United States.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.000
Many of these are a father

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.000
who has to leave his family behind to go get a job --

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.000
sometimes a single mother

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:10.000
who has to get enough money to even pay for food or clothing.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000
Sadly, sometimes there are even children

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.000
who are trying to get reunited with their parents

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:18.000
that they haven't seen, in some cases, for a decade.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.000
So what kind of an idea is it

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.000
to think about building a brand new city in Honduras?

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.000
Or to build a dozen of these,

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.000
or a hundred of these, around the world?

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.000
What kind of an idea is it

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000
to think about insisting

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:34.000
that every family have a choice of several cities

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:37.000
that are competing to attract new residents?

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:40.000
This is an idea worth spreading.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000
And my friends from Honduras

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.000
asked me to say thank you, TED.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:52.000
(Applause)
