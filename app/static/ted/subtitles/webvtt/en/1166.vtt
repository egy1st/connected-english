00:00:00.658 --> 00:00:05.320
I want you to imagine two couples
in the middle of 1979

00:00:05.344 --> 00:00:08.613
on the exact same day,
at the exact same moment,

00:00:08.637 --> 00:00:10.919
each conceiving a baby, OK?

00:00:10.943 --> 00:00:13.197
So two couples each conceiving one baby.

00:00:13.221 --> 00:00:16.487
Now I don't want you to spend too
much time imagining the conception,

00:00:16.511 --> 00:00:19.367
because if you do,
you're not going to listen to me,

00:00:19.391 --> 00:00:21.202
so just imagine that for a moment.

00:00:21.226 --> 00:00:25.400
And in this scenario,
I want to imagine that, in one case,

00:00:25.424 --> 00:00:27.592
the sperm is carrying a Y chromosome,

00:00:27.616 --> 00:00:29.647
meeting that X chromosome of the egg.

00:00:29.671 --> 00:00:32.843
And in the other case,
the sperm is carrying an X chromosome,

00:00:32.867 --> 00:00:35.134
meeting the X chromosome of the egg.

00:00:35.158 --> 00:00:37.209
Both are viable; both take off.

00:00:37.747 --> 00:00:39.795
We'll come back to these people later.

00:00:39.819 --> 00:00:43.222
So I wear two hats in most of what I do.

00:00:43.874 --> 00:00:47.073
As the one hat, I do history of anatomy.

00:00:47.097 --> 00:00:50.976
I'm a historian by training,
and what I study in that case

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.586
is the way that people
have dealt with anatomy --

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.240
meaning human bodies, animal bodies --

00:00:56.264 --> 00:00:58.976
how they dealt with bodily fluids,
concepts of bodies;

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:00.976
how have they thought about bodies.

00:01:01.733 --> 00:01:05.689
The other hat that I've worn
in my work is as an activist,

00:01:05.713 --> 00:01:07.569
as a patient advocate --

00:01:07.593 --> 00:01:09.976
or, as I sometimes say,
as an impatient advocate --

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.237
for people who are patients of doctors.

00:01:12.261 --> 00:01:15.976
In that case, what I've worked with
is people who have body types

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:17.915
that challenge social norms.

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:20.096
So some of what
I've worked on, for example,

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:22.167
is people who are conjoined twins --

00:01:22.191 --> 00:01:23.694
two people within one body.

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.960
Some of what I've worked on
is people who have dwarfism --

00:01:26.984 --> 00:01:29.268
so people who are much
shorter than typical.

00:01:29.292 --> 00:01:33.314
And a lot of what I've worked on
is people who have atypical sex --

00:01:33.338 --> 00:01:37.366
so people who don't have the standard male
or the standard female body types.

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:40.976
And as a general term,
we can use the term "intersex" for this.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.538
Intersex comes
in a lot of different forms.

00:01:43.562 --> 00:01:46.976
I'll just give you a few examples
of the types of ways you can have sex

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.333
that isn't standard for male or female.

00:01:49.357 --> 00:01:50.976
So in one instance,

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.436
you can have somebody
who has an XY chromosomal basis,

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:56.976
and that SRY gene on the Y chromosome

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.404
tells the proto-gonads,
which we all have in the fetal life,

00:02:00.428 --> 00:02:01.612
to become testes.

00:02:01.636 --> 00:02:04.758
So in the fetal life,
those testes are pumping out testosterone.

00:02:04.782 --> 00:02:09.965
But because this individual
lacks receptors to hear that testosterone,

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:12.069
the body doesn't react
to the testosterone.

00:02:12.093 --> 00:02:15.153
And this is a syndrome called
androgen insensitivity syndrome.

00:02:15.692 --> 00:02:18.554
So lots of levels of testosterone,
but no reaction to it.

00:02:18.578 --> 00:02:22.480
As a consequence, the body develops
more along the female typical path.

00:02:22.504 --> 00:02:24.782
When the child is born,
she looks like a girl.

00:02:24.806 --> 00:02:27.904
She is a girl, she is raised as a girl.

00:02:27.928 --> 00:02:32.474
And it's often not until she hits puberty
and she's growing and developing breasts,

00:02:32.498 --> 00:02:34.077
but she's not getting her period,

00:02:34.101 --> 00:02:36.265
that somebody figures
out something's up here.

00:02:36.289 --> 00:02:38.058
And they do some tests and figure out

00:02:38.082 --> 00:02:40.559
that, instead of having
ovaries inside and a uterus,

00:02:40.583 --> 00:02:43.029
she has testes inside,
and she has a Y chromosome.

00:02:43.053 --> 00:02:44.744
Now what's important to understand

00:02:44.768 --> 00:02:47.256
is you may think of this
person as really being male,

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:48.508
but they're really not.

00:02:48.532 --> 00:02:50.596
Females, like males,

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:53.275
have in our bodies something
called the adrenal glands.

00:02:53.299 --> 00:02:54.856
They're in the back of our body.

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:58.310
And the adrenal glands make androgens,
which are a masculinizing hormone.

00:02:58.334 --> 00:03:01.435
Most females like me --
I believe myself to be a typical female --

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:03.618
I don't actually know
my chromosomal make-up,

00:03:03.642 --> 00:03:05.327
but I think I'm probably typical --

00:03:05.351 --> 00:03:07.833
most females like me
are actually androgen-sensitive.

00:03:07.857 --> 00:03:10.578
We're making androgen,
and we're responding to androgens.

00:03:10.602 --> 00:03:12.691
The consequence is that somebody like me

00:03:12.715 --> 00:03:15.734
has actually had a brain
exposed to more androgens

00:03:15.758 --> 00:03:19.140
than the woman born with testes
who has androgen insensitivity syndrome.

00:03:19.164 --> 00:03:20.686
So sex is really complicated --

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:22.354
it's not just that intersex people

00:03:22.378 --> 00:03:24.455
are in the middle
of all the sex spectrum --

00:03:24.479 --> 00:03:26.576
in some ways,
they can be all over the place.

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:27.758
Another example:

00:03:27.782 --> 00:03:30.687
a few years ago I got a call
from a man who was 19 years old,

00:03:30.711 --> 00:03:32.574
who was born a boy, raised a boy,

00:03:32.598 --> 00:03:35.183
had a girlfriend,
had sex with his girlfriend,

00:03:35.207 --> 00:03:36.879
had a life as a guy,

00:03:36.903 --> 00:03:40.000
and had just found out
that he had ovaries and a uterus inside.

00:03:40.529 --> 00:03:42.281
What he had was an extreme form

00:03:42.305 --> 00:03:44.986
of a condition called
congenital adrenal hyperplasia.

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:46.936
He had XX chromosomes,

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:50.699
and in the womb, his adrenal glands
were in such high gear

00:03:50.723 --> 00:03:54.341
that it created, essentially,
a masculine hormonal environment.

00:03:54.365 --> 00:03:56.903
And as a consequence,
his genitals were masculinized,

00:03:56.927 --> 00:04:00.439
his brain was subject to the more typical
masculine component of hormones.

00:04:00.463 --> 00:04:03.700
And he was born looking like a boy --
nobody suspected anything.

00:04:03.724 --> 00:04:06.435
And it was only when he had
reached the age of 19

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:10.050
that he began to have enough medical
problems from menstruating internally,

00:04:10.074 --> 00:04:13.446
that doctors figured out that, in fact,
he was female, internally.

00:04:13.934 --> 00:04:17.468
OK, so just one more quick example
of a way you can have intersex.

00:04:17.492 --> 00:04:21.371
Some people who have XX chromosomes
develop what are called ovotestis,

00:04:21.395 --> 00:04:25.134
which is when you have ovarian tissue
with testicular tissue wrapped around it.

00:04:25.158 --> 00:04:27.284
And we're not exactly sure
why that happens.

00:04:27.308 --> 00:04:30.131
So sex can come
in lots of different varieties.

00:04:30.155 --> 00:04:35.002
The reason that children
with these kinds of bodies --

00:04:35.026 --> 00:04:37.793
whether it's dwarfism,
or it's conjoined twinning,

00:04:37.817 --> 00:04:39.143
or it's an intersex type --

00:04:39.167 --> 00:04:41.548
are often "normalized" by surgeons

00:04:41.572 --> 00:04:45.612
is not because it actually leaves them
better off in terms of physical health.

00:04:45.636 --> 00:04:48.618
In many cases, people are actually
perfectly healthy.

00:04:48.642 --> 00:04:51.684
The reason they're often subject
to various kinds of surgeries

00:04:51.708 --> 00:04:54.529
is because they threaten
our social categories.

00:04:54.553 --> 00:04:57.322
Our system has been based
typically on the idea

00:04:57.346 --> 00:05:00.676
that a particular kind of anatomy
comes with a particular identity.

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:03.303
So we have the concept
that what it means to be a woman

00:05:03.327 --> 00:05:04.719
is to have a female identity;

00:05:04.743 --> 00:05:08.976
what it means to be a black person
is, allegedly, to have an African anatomy

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:10.559
in terms of your history.

00:05:11.117 --> 00:05:14.896
And so we have
this terribly simplistic idea.

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:16.553
And when we're faced with a body

00:05:16.577 --> 00:05:19.511
that actually presents us
something quite different,

00:05:19.535 --> 00:05:22.329
it startles us in terms
of those categorizations.

00:05:22.353 --> 00:05:26.294
So we have a lot of very romantic ideas
in our culture about individualism.

00:05:26.318 --> 00:05:29.959
And our nation's really founded on
a very romantic concept of individualism.

00:05:29.983 --> 00:05:31.888
You can imagine how startling then it is

00:05:31.912 --> 00:05:35.742
when you have children who are born
who are two people inside of one body.

00:05:36.271 --> 00:05:40.274
Where I ran into the most heat
from this most recently

00:05:40.298 --> 00:05:43.169
was last year when South African runner,
Caster Semenya,

00:05:43.193 --> 00:05:46.748
had her sex called into question
at the International Games in Berlin.

00:05:46.772 --> 00:05:49.596
I had a lot of journalists
calling me, asking me,

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:51.494
"Which is the test they're going to run

00:05:51.518 --> 00:05:54.976
that will tell us whether or not
Caster Semenya is male or female?"

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.293
And I had to explain to the journalists
there isn't such a test.

00:05:58.317 --> 00:06:02.168
In fact, we now know
that sex is complicated enough

00:06:02.192 --> 00:06:03.926
that we have to admit:

00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:07.639
Nature doesn't draw the line
for us between male and female,

00:06:07.663 --> 00:06:10.572
or between male and intersex
and female and intersex;

00:06:10.596 --> 00:06:12.671
we actually draw that line on nature.

00:06:13.192 --> 00:06:17.859
So what we have is a sort of situation
where the farther our science goes,

00:06:17.883 --> 00:06:20.819
the more we have to admit to ourselves
that these categories

00:06:20.843 --> 00:06:23.530
that we thought of as stable
anatomical categories,

00:06:23.554 --> 00:06:27.221
that mapped very simply
to stable identity categories

00:06:27.245 --> 00:06:29.380
are a lot more fuzzy than we thought.

00:06:29.404 --> 00:06:31.357
And it's not just in terms of sex.

00:06:31.381 --> 00:06:32.976
It's also in terms of race,

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.416
which turns out to be
vastly more complicated

00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:37.532
than our terminology has allowed.

00:06:37.556 --> 00:06:40.648
As we look, we get into all sorts
of uncomfortable areas.

00:06:40.672 --> 00:06:42.501
We look, for example, about the fact

00:06:42.525 --> 00:06:46.837
that we share at least 95 percent
of our DNA with chimpanzees.

00:06:46.861 --> 00:06:48.561
What are we to make of the fact

00:06:48.585 --> 00:06:52.052
that we differ from them
only, really, by a few nucleotides?

00:06:52.076 --> 00:06:54.519
And as we get farther
and farther with our science,

00:06:54.543 --> 00:06:56.732
we get more and more
into a discomforted zone,

00:06:56.756 --> 00:07:00.041
where we have to acknowledge
that the simplistic categories we've had

00:07:00.065 --> 00:07:02.163
are probably overly simplistic.

00:07:02.663 --> 00:07:06.274
So we're seeing this
in all sorts of places in human life.

00:07:06.298 --> 00:07:08.503
One of the places
we're seeing it, for example,

00:07:08.527 --> 00:07:10.541
in our culture,
in the United States today,

00:07:10.565 --> 00:07:13.344
is battles over the beginning
of life and the end of life.

00:07:13.368 --> 00:07:14.976
We have difficult conversations

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.139
about at what point we decide
a body becomes a human,

00:07:18.163 --> 00:07:21.128
such that it has a different
right than a fetal life.

00:07:21.152 --> 00:07:23.676
We have very difficult
conversations nowadays --

00:07:23.700 --> 00:07:26.449
probably not out in the open
as much as within medicine --

00:07:26.473 --> 00:07:28.722
about the question
of when somebody's dead.

00:07:28.746 --> 00:07:31.373
In the past, our ancestors
never had to struggle so much

00:07:31.397 --> 00:07:33.499
with this question
of when somebody was dead.

00:07:33.523 --> 00:07:35.915
At most, they'd stick
a feather on somebody's nose,

00:07:35.939 --> 00:07:38.083
and if it twitched,
they didn't bury them yet.

00:07:38.107 --> 00:07:39.966
If it stopped twitching, you bury them.

00:07:39.990 --> 00:07:41.426
But today, we have a situation

00:07:41.450 --> 00:07:43.761
where we want to take
vital organs out of beings

00:07:43.785 --> 00:07:45.369
and give them to other beings.

00:07:45.393 --> 00:07:46.852
And as a consequence,

00:07:46.876 --> 00:07:49.480
we have to struggle
with this really difficult question

00:07:49.504 --> 00:07:51.139
about who's dead,

00:07:51.163 --> 00:07:53.508
and this leads us
to a really difficult situation

00:07:53.532 --> 00:07:56.508
where we don't have such simple
categories as we've had before.

00:07:56.532 --> 00:07:59.643
Now you might think that all this
breaking-down of categories

00:07:59.667 --> 00:08:01.653
would make somebody like me really happy.

00:08:01.677 --> 00:08:04.729
I'm a political progressive,
I defend people with unusual bodies,

00:08:04.753 --> 00:08:07.188
but I have to admit to you
that it makes me nervous.

00:08:07.212 --> 00:08:08.902
Understanding that these categories

00:08:08.926 --> 00:08:12.019
are really much more unstable
than we thought makes me tense.

00:08:12.043 --> 00:08:15.296
It makes me tense from the point of view
of thinking about democracy.

00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:17.476
So in order to tell you
about that tension,

00:08:17.500 --> 00:08:20.617
I have to first admit to you
a huge fan of the Founding Fathers.

00:08:20.641 --> 00:08:23.250
I know they were racists,
I know they were sexist,

00:08:23.274 --> 00:08:24.447
but they were great.

00:08:24.471 --> 00:08:29.585
I mean, they were so brave and so bold
and so radical in what they did,

00:08:29.609 --> 00:08:34.079
that I find myself watching that cheesy
musical "1776" every few years,

00:08:34.103 --> 00:08:37.107
and it's not because of the music,
which is totally forgettable.

00:08:37.131 --> 00:08:40.469
It's because of what happened in 1776
with the Founding Fathers.

00:08:40.493 --> 00:08:42.767
The Founding Fathers were,
for my point of view,

00:08:42.791 --> 00:08:44.843
the original anatomical activists,

00:08:44.867 --> 00:08:46.472
and this is why.

00:08:46.496 --> 00:08:49.771
What they rejected
was an anatomical concept

00:08:49.795 --> 00:08:51.331
and replaced it with another one

00:08:51.355 --> 00:08:54.684
that was radical and beautiful
and held us for 200 years.

00:08:54.708 --> 00:08:56.430
So as you all recall,

00:08:56.454 --> 00:08:59.858
what our Founding Fathers were
rejecting was a concept of monarchy,

00:08:59.882 --> 00:09:03.520
and the monarchy was basically based
on a very simplistic concept of anatomy.

00:09:03.544 --> 00:09:07.183
The monarchs of the old world
didn't have a concept of DNA,

00:09:07.207 --> 00:09:09.340
but they did have a concept of birthright.

00:09:09.364 --> 00:09:11.036
They had a concept of blue blood.

00:09:11.060 --> 00:09:14.243
They had the idea that the people
who would be in political power

00:09:14.267 --> 00:09:17.444
should be in political power
because of the blood being passed down

00:09:17.468 --> 00:09:21.142
from grandfather to father
to son and so forth.

00:09:21.794 --> 00:09:24.162
The Founding Fathers rejected that idea,

00:09:24.186 --> 00:09:26.837
and they replaced it
with a new anatomical concept,

00:09:26.861 --> 00:09:30.694
and that concept
was "all men are created equal."

00:09:30.718 --> 00:09:34.081
They leveled that playing field
and decided the anatomy that mattered

00:09:34.105 --> 00:09:38.519
was the commonality of anatomy,
not the difference in anatomy,

00:09:38.543 --> 00:09:41.087
and that was a really radical thing to do.

00:09:41.560 --> 00:09:43.012
Now they were doing it in part

00:09:43.036 --> 00:09:45.328
because they were part
of an Enlightenment system

00:09:45.352 --> 00:09:47.361
where two things were growing up together.

00:09:47.385 --> 00:09:49.653
And that was democracy growing up,

00:09:49.677 --> 00:09:52.742
but it was also science
growing up at the same time.

00:09:52.766 --> 00:09:56.245
And it's really clear, if you look
at the history of the Founding Fathers,

00:09:56.269 --> 00:09:58.555
a lot of them were very
interested in science,

00:09:58.579 --> 00:10:01.607
and they were interested
in the concept of a naturalistic world.

00:10:01.631 --> 00:10:04.117
They were moving away
from supernatural explanations,

00:10:04.141 --> 00:10:07.378
and they were rejecting things
like a supernatural concept of power,

00:10:07.402 --> 00:10:11.457
where it transmitted because
of a very vague concept of birthright.

00:10:11.481 --> 00:10:13.763
They were moving
towards a naturalistic concept.

00:10:13.787 --> 00:10:16.842
And if you look, for example,
in the Declaration of Independence,

00:10:16.866 --> 00:10:19.572
they talk about nature and nature's God.

00:10:19.596 --> 00:10:21.785
They don't talk about God
and God's nature.

00:10:21.809 --> 00:10:25.712
They're talking about the power of nature
to tell us who we are.

00:10:25.736 --> 00:10:28.976
So as part of that,
they were coming to us with a concept

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.710
that was about anatomical commonality.

00:10:31.734 --> 00:10:34.863
And in doing so, they were really
setting up in a beautiful way

00:10:34.887 --> 00:10:36.800
the Civil Rights Movement of the future.

00:10:36.824 --> 00:10:40.365
They didn't think of it that way,
but they did it for us, and it was great.

00:10:40.389 --> 00:10:42.032
So what happened years afterwards?

00:10:42.056 --> 00:10:45.498
What happened was women, for example,
who wanted the right to vote,

00:10:45.522 --> 00:10:48.884
took the Founding Fathers' concept
of anatomical commonality

00:10:48.908 --> 00:10:51.115
being more important
than anatomical difference

00:10:51.139 --> 00:10:53.673
and said, "The fact that we have
a uterus and ovaries

00:10:53.697 --> 00:10:56.460
is not significant enough
in terms of a difference

00:10:56.484 --> 00:10:58.773
to mean that we shouldn't
have the right to vote,

00:10:58.797 --> 00:11:02.479
the right to full citizenship,
the right to own property, etc."

00:11:02.503 --> 00:11:04.555
And women successfully argued that.

00:11:04.579 --> 00:11:06.976
Next came the successful
Civil Rights Movement,

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.119
where we found people like Sojourner Truth

00:11:09.143 --> 00:11:11.412
talking about, "Ain't I a woman?"

00:11:11.436 --> 00:11:15.381
We find men on the marching lines
of the Civil Rights Movement

00:11:15.405 --> 00:11:16.755
saying, "I am a man."

00:11:16.779 --> 00:11:21.176
Again, people of color
appealing to a commonality of anatomy

00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:23.890
over a difference of anatomy,
again, successfully.

00:11:23.914 --> 00:11:26.951
We see the same thing
with the disability rights movement.

00:11:27.292 --> 00:11:29.450
The problem is, of course,

00:11:29.474 --> 00:11:31.852
that, as we begin to look
at all that commonality,

00:11:31.876 --> 00:11:35.301
we have to begin to question
why we maintain certain divisions.

00:11:35.325 --> 00:11:38.054
Mind you, I want to maintain
some divisions,

00:11:38.078 --> 00:11:39.745
anatomically, in our culture.

00:11:39.769 --> 00:11:43.449
For example, I don't want to give a fish
the same rights as a human.

00:11:43.473 --> 00:11:46.058
I don't want to say
we give up entirely on anatomy.

00:11:46.082 --> 00:11:47.749
I don't want to say a five-year-old

00:11:47.773 --> 00:11:50.404
should be allowed to consent
to sex or consent to marry.

00:11:50.428 --> 00:11:52.395
So there are some anatomical divisions

00:11:52.419 --> 00:11:55.728
that make sense to me
and that I think we should retain.

00:11:55.752 --> 00:11:58.645
But the challenge is trying
to figure out which ones they are

00:11:58.669 --> 00:12:01.280
and why do we retain them,
and do they have meaning.

00:12:01.304 --> 00:12:05.094
So let's go back to those two beings
conceived at the beginning of this talk.

00:12:05.118 --> 00:12:06.976
We have two beings, both conceived

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:10.491
in the middle of 1979
on the exact same day.

00:12:10.515 --> 00:12:14.265
Let's imagine one of them, Mary,
is born three months prematurely,

00:12:14.289 --> 00:12:16.791
so she's born on June 1, 1980.

00:12:16.815 --> 00:12:20.988
Henry, by contrast, is born at term,
so he's born on March 1, 1980.

00:12:21.586 --> 00:12:23.378
Simply by virtue of the fact

00:12:23.402 --> 00:12:25.860
that Mary was born
prematurely three months,

00:12:25.884 --> 00:12:30.126
she comes into all sorts of rights
three months earlier than Henry does --

00:12:30.150 --> 00:12:34.365
the right to consent to sex,
the right to vote, the right to drink.

00:12:34.389 --> 00:12:36.022
Henry has to wait for all of that,

00:12:36.046 --> 00:12:39.060
not because he's actually
any different in age, biologically,

00:12:39.084 --> 00:12:41.349
except in terms of when he was born.

00:12:41.989 --> 00:12:45.149
We find other kinds of weirdness
in terms of what their rights are.

00:12:45.173 --> 00:12:47.366
Henry, by virtue of being
assumed to be male --

00:12:47.390 --> 00:12:49.781
although I haven't told you
that he's the XY one --

00:12:49.805 --> 00:12:53.976
by virtue of being assumed to be male
is now liable to be drafted,

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:55.940
which Mary does not need to worry about.

00:12:55.964 --> 00:12:59.737
Mary, meanwhile, cannot in all the states
have the same right

00:12:59.761 --> 00:13:01.361
that Henry has in all the states,

00:13:01.385 --> 00:13:02.867
namely, the right to marry.

00:13:02.891 --> 00:13:05.655
Henry can marry, in every state, a woman,

00:13:05.679 --> 00:13:08.687
but Mary can only marry today
in a few states, a woman.

00:13:09.219 --> 00:13:12.112
So we have these anatomical
categories that persist,

00:13:12.136 --> 00:13:15.885
that are in many ways
problematic and questionable.

00:13:15.909 --> 00:13:17.630
And the question to me becomes:

00:13:17.654 --> 00:13:23.642
What do we do, as our science
gets to be so good in looking at anatomy,

00:13:23.666 --> 00:13:26.236
that we reach the point
where we have to admit

00:13:26.260 --> 00:13:29.137
that a democracy
that's been based on anatomy

00:13:29.161 --> 00:13:30.593
might start falling apart?

00:13:31.880 --> 00:13:34.604
I don't want to give up the science,
but at the same time,

00:13:34.628 --> 00:13:37.776
it feels sometimes like the science
is coming out from under us.

00:13:37.800 --> 00:13:38.976
So where do we go?

00:13:39.829 --> 00:13:43.910
It seems like what happens in our culture
is a sort of pragmatic attitude:

00:13:43.934 --> 00:13:47.372
"We have to draw the line somewhere,
so we will draw the line somewhere."

00:13:47.396 --> 00:13:50.082
But a lot of people get stuck
in a very strange position.

00:13:50.106 --> 00:13:54.976
So for example, Texas has at one point
decided that what it means to marry a man

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.395
is to mean that you don't have
a Y chromosome,

00:13:57.419 --> 00:14:00.489
and what it means to marry a woman
means you have a Y chromosome.

00:14:00.513 --> 00:14:03.235
In practice they don't test people
for their chromosomes.

00:14:03.259 --> 00:14:04.742
But this is also very bizarre,

00:14:04.766 --> 00:14:07.086
because of the story I told you
at the beginning

00:14:07.110 --> 00:14:08.920
about androgen insensitivity syndrome.

00:14:08.944 --> 00:14:12.476
If we look at one of the Founding Fathers
of modern democracy,

00:14:12.500 --> 00:14:13.680
Dr. Martin Luther King,

00:14:13.704 --> 00:14:16.907
he offers us something of a solution
in his "I have a dream" speech.

00:14:16.931 --> 00:14:20.198
He says we should judge people
"based not on the color of their skin,

00:14:20.222 --> 00:14:22.093
but on the content of their character,"

00:14:22.117 --> 00:14:23.639
moving beyond anatomy.

00:14:23.663 --> 00:14:26.642
And I want to say, "Yeah, that sounds
like a really good idea."

00:14:26.666 --> 00:14:28.322
But in practice, how do you do it?

00:14:28.346 --> 00:14:31.296
How do you judge people based
on the content of character?

00:14:31.833 --> 00:14:32.985
I also want to point out

00:14:33.009 --> 00:14:36.820
that I'm not sure that is how we should
distribute rights in terms of humans,

00:14:36.844 --> 00:14:40.147
because, I have to admit, that there
are some golden retrievers I know

00:14:40.171 --> 00:14:43.748
that are probably more deserving of social
services than some humans I know.

00:14:43.772 --> 00:14:47.367
I also want to say there are probably
also some yellow Labradors that I know

00:14:47.391 --> 00:14:50.414
that are more capable of informed,
intelligent, mature decisions

00:14:50.438 --> 00:14:53.160
about sexual relations
than some 40-year-olds that I know.

00:14:53.184 --> 00:14:57.362
So how do we operationalize
the question of content of character?

00:14:57.386 --> 00:14:59.311
It turns out to be really difficult.

00:14:59.335 --> 00:15:00.816
And part of me also wonders,

00:15:00.840 --> 00:15:02.712
what if content of character

00:15:02.736 --> 00:15:05.976
turns out to be something
that's scannable in the future --

00:15:06.721 --> 00:15:09.030
able to be seen with an fMRI?

00:15:09.054 --> 00:15:10.665
Do we really want to go there?

00:15:11.100 --> 00:15:12.436
I'm not sure where we go.

00:15:12.460 --> 00:15:15.011
What I do know is that it seems
to be really important

00:15:15.035 --> 00:15:17.978
to think about the idea
of the United States being in the lead

00:15:18.002 --> 00:15:20.006
of thinking about this issue of democracy.

00:15:20.030 --> 00:15:22.741
We've done a really good job
struggling with democracy,

00:15:22.765 --> 00:15:25.099
and I think we would do
a good job in the future.

00:15:25.123 --> 00:15:27.726
We don't have a situation
that Iran has, for example,

00:15:27.750 --> 00:15:30.043
where a man who's sexually
attracted to other men

00:15:30.067 --> 00:15:31.264
is liable to be murdered,

00:15:31.288 --> 00:15:33.459
unless he's willing
to submit to a sex change,

00:15:33.483 --> 00:15:35.370
in which case he's allowed to live.

00:15:35.908 --> 00:15:37.699
We don't have that kind of situation.

00:15:37.723 --> 00:15:41.022
I'm glad to say we don't have
the kind of situation with --

00:15:41.046 --> 00:15:43.029
a surgeon I talked to a few years ago

00:15:43.053 --> 00:15:45.489
who had brought over a set
of conjoined twins

00:15:45.513 --> 00:15:48.424
in order to separate them,
partly to make a name for himself.

00:15:48.448 --> 00:15:51.898
But when I was on the phone with him,
asking why he'll do this surgery --

00:15:51.922 --> 00:15:55.648
this was a very high-risk surgery --
his answer was that, in this other nation,

00:15:55.672 --> 00:15:59.305
these children were going to be treated
very badly, and so he had to do this.

00:15:59.329 --> 00:16:02.481
My response to him was, "Well,
have you considered political asylum

00:16:02.505 --> 00:16:04.112
instead of a separation surgery?"

00:16:04.136 --> 00:16:06.585
The United States has offered
tremendous possibility

00:16:06.609 --> 00:16:08.976
for allowing people
to be the way they are,

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:12.698
without having them have
to be changed for the sake of the state.

00:16:12.722 --> 00:16:14.900
So I think we have to be in the lead.

00:16:14.924 --> 00:16:17.381
Well, just to close,
I want to suggest to you

00:16:17.405 --> 00:16:19.936
that I've been talking
a lot about the Fathers.

00:16:19.960 --> 00:16:21.976
And I want to think
about the possibilities

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:24.905
of what democracy might look like,
or might have looked like,

00:16:24.929 --> 00:16:26.802
if we had more involved the mothers.

00:16:27.385 --> 00:16:30.423
And I want to say something
a little bit radical for a feminist,

00:16:30.447 --> 00:16:34.292
and that is that I think that there may be
different kinds of insights

00:16:34.316 --> 00:16:36.565
that can come from different
kinds of anatomies,

00:16:36.589 --> 00:16:39.211
particularly when we have
people thinking in groups.

00:16:39.235 --> 00:16:41.742
For years, because
I've been interested in intersex,

00:16:41.766 --> 00:16:44.243
I've also been interested
in sex-difference research.

00:16:44.267 --> 00:16:46.620
And one of the things
that I've been interested in

00:16:46.644 --> 00:16:49.246
is looking at the differences
between males and females

00:16:49.270 --> 00:16:51.909
in terms of the way they think
and operate in the world.

00:16:51.933 --> 00:16:54.006
And what we know
from cross-cultural studies

00:16:54.030 --> 00:16:55.870
is that females, on average --

00:16:55.894 --> 00:16:57.976
not everyone, but on average --

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:02.891
are more inclined to be very attentive
to complex social relations

00:17:02.915 --> 00:17:04.493
and to taking care of people

00:17:04.517 --> 00:17:06.793
who are, basically,
vulnerable within the group.

00:17:07.519 --> 00:17:09.726
And so if we think about that,

00:17:09.750 --> 00:17:11.751
we have an interesting situation in hands.

00:17:11.775 --> 00:17:13.741
Years ago, when I was in graduate school,

00:17:13.765 --> 00:17:16.962
one of my graduate advisors
who knew I was interested in feminism --

00:17:16.986 --> 00:17:19.222
I considered myself
a feminist, as I still do,

00:17:19.246 --> 00:17:20.795
asked a really strange question.

00:17:20.819 --> 00:17:23.728
He said, "Tell me what's feminine
about feminism."

00:17:23.752 --> 00:17:26.923
And I thought, "Well, that's the dumbest
question I've ever heard.

00:17:26.947 --> 00:17:29.521
Feminism is all about undoing
stereotypes about gender,

00:17:29.545 --> 00:17:31.607
so there's nothing
feminine about feminism."

00:17:31.631 --> 00:17:33.656
But the more I thought about his question,

00:17:33.680 --> 00:17:36.898
the more I thought there might be
something feminine about feminism.

00:17:36.922 --> 00:17:39.631
That is to say, there might be
something, on average,

00:17:39.655 --> 00:17:42.527
different about female
brains from male brains

00:17:42.551 --> 00:17:47.615
that makes us more attentive
to deeply complex social relationships,

00:17:47.639 --> 00:17:50.472
and more attentive
to taking care of the vulnerable.

00:17:50.496 --> 00:17:52.999
So whereas the Fathers
were extremely attentive

00:17:53.023 --> 00:17:56.834
to figuring out how to protect
individuals from the state,

00:17:56.858 --> 00:18:00.703
it's possible that if we injected
more mothers into this concept,

00:18:00.727 --> 00:18:04.333
what we would have is more of a concept
of not just how to protect,

00:18:04.357 --> 00:18:06.677
but how to care for each other.

00:18:06.701 --> 00:18:09.274
And maybe that's where
we need to go in the future,

00:18:09.298 --> 00:18:11.505
when we take democracy beyond anatomy,

00:18:11.529 --> 00:18:15.064
is to think less about the individual body
in terms of the identity,

00:18:15.088 --> 00:18:17.438
and think more about those relationships.

00:18:17.462 --> 00:18:20.927
So that as we the people
try to create a more perfect union,

00:18:20.951 --> 00:18:23.844
we're thinking about what we do
for each other.

00:18:23.868 --> 00:18:25.019
Thank you.

00:18:25.043 --> 00:18:27.817
