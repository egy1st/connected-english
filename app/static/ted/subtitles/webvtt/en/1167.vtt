00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
From all outward appearances,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
John had everything going for him.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
He had just signed the contract

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
to sell his New York apartment

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
at a six-figure profit,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
and he'd only owned it for five years.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
The school where he graduated from with his master's

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
had just offered him a teaching appointment,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
which meant not only a salary,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
but benefits for the first time in ages.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
And yet, despite everything going really well for John,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
he was struggling,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
fighting addiction and a gripping depression.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
On the night of June 11th, 2003,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
he climbed up to the edge

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
of the fence on the Manhattan Bridge

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
and he leaped to the treacherous waters below.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Remarkably --

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
no, miraculously --

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
he lived.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
The fall shattered his right arm,

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
broke every rib that he had,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
punctured his lung,

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
and he drifted in and out of consciousness

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
as he drifted down the East River,

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
under the Brooklyn Bridge

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
and out into the pathway of the Staten Island Ferry,

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
where passengers on the ferry

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
heard his cries of pain,

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
contacted the boat's captain

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
who contacted the Coast Guard

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
who fished him out of the East River

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
and took him to Bellevue Hospital.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
And that's actually where our story begins.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
Because once John committed himself

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
to putting his life back together --

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000
first physically, then emotionally,

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
and then spiritually --

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
he found that there were very few resources available

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
to someone who has attempted to end their life

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
in the way that he did.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
Research shows

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
that 19 out of 20 people

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
who attempt suicide

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
will fail.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
But the people who fail

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000
are 37 times more likely to succeed

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
the second time.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
This truly is

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
an at-risk population

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
with very few resources to support them.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
And what happens

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000
when people try to assemble themselves back into life,

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
because of our taboos around suicide,

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
we're not sure what to say,

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
and so quite often we say nothing.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
And that furthers the isolation

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
that people like John found themselves in.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
I know John's story very well

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
because I'm John.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000
And this is, today,

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000
the first time in any sort of public setting

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
I've ever acknowledged

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
the journey that I have been on.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000
But after having lost a beloved teacher in 2006

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.000
and a good friend last year to suicide,

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000
and sitting last year at TEDActive,

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000
I knew that I needed to step out of my silence

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
and past my taboos

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000
to talk about an idea worth spreading --

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
and that is that people

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
who have made the difficult choice

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
to come back to life

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000
need more resources and need our help.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000
As the Trevor Project says, it gets better.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000
It gets way better.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000
And I'm choosing to come out

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000
of a totally different kind of closet today

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.000
to encourage you, to urge you,

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
that if you are someone

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.000
who has contemplated or attempted suicide,

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.000
or you know somebody who has,

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.000
talk about it; get help.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.000
It's a conversation worth having

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.000
and an idea worth spreading.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000
Thank you.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:53.000
(Applause)
