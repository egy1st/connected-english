WEBVTT

00:00:00.873 --> 00:00:02.031
A couple of years ago,

00:00:02.055 --> 00:00:05.164
when I was attending
the TED conference in Long Beach,

00:00:05.188 --> 00:00:06.553
I met Harriet.

00:00:06.577 --> 00:00:09.976
We'd actually met online before --
not the way you're thinking.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.435
We were introduced
because we both knew Linda Avey,

00:00:12.459 --> 00:00:15.763
one of the founders of the first
online personal genomic companies.

00:00:15.787 --> 00:00:18.484
And because we shared
our genetic information with Linda,

00:00:18.508 --> 00:00:20.415
she could see that Harriet and I shared

00:00:20.439 --> 00:00:24.329
a very rare type of mitochondrial DNA,
haplotype K1a1b1a,

00:00:24.353 --> 00:00:26.348
which meant we were distantly related.

00:00:26.372 --> 00:00:29.205
We actually share the same
genealogy with Ötzi the Iceman.

00:00:29.229 --> 00:00:30.740
So -- Ötzi, Harriet and me.

00:00:30.764 --> 00:00:34.165
And being the current day, of course,
we started our own Facebook group.

00:00:34.189 --> 00:00:35.488
You're all welcome to join.

00:00:35.512 --> 00:00:38.592
When I met Harriet in person
the next year at the TED conference,

00:00:38.616 --> 00:00:41.604
she'd gone online and ordered
our own happy haplotype T-shirts.

00:00:41.628 --> 00:00:42.639
(Laughter)

00:00:42.663 --> 00:00:44.206
Why am I telling you this story?

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:46.572
What does it have to do
with the future of health?

00:00:46.596 --> 00:00:48.572
Well, the way I met Harriet is an example

00:00:48.596 --> 00:00:52.347
of how leveraging cross-disciplinary,
exponentially growing technologies

00:00:52.371 --> 00:00:54.682
is affecting our future
of health and wellness --

00:00:54.706 --> 00:00:56.056
from low-cost gene analysis

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:58.198
to the ability to do
powerful bioinformatics

00:00:58.222 --> 00:01:01.031
to the connection of the Internet
and social networking.

00:01:01.589 --> 00:01:03.189
What I'd like to talk about today

00:01:03.213 --> 00:01:05.473
is understanding
these exponential technologies.

00:01:05.497 --> 00:01:07.054
We often think linearly.

00:01:07.078 --> 00:01:09.666
But if you think about it,
if you have a lily pad

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:11.653
and it just divided every single day --

00:01:11.677 --> 00:01:15.333
two, four, eight, sixteen --
in 15 days, you'd have 32,000.

00:01:15.357 --> 00:01:17.292
What do you think you'd have in a month?

00:01:17.316 --> 00:01:18.467
We're at a billion.

00:01:18.491 --> 00:01:20.163
If we start to think exponentially,

00:01:20.187 --> 00:01:23.639
we can see how this is starting to affect
all the technologies around us.

00:01:23.663 --> 00:01:26.766
Many of these technologies,
speaking as a physician and innovator,

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.882
we can start to leverage,
to impact the future of our own health

00:01:29.906 --> 00:01:31.057
and of health care,

00:01:31.081 --> 00:01:34.166
and to address many of the major
challenges in health care today,

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:37.355
ranging from the exponential costs
to the aging population,

00:01:37.379 --> 00:01:40.079
the way we really don't use
information very well today,

00:01:40.103 --> 00:01:41.593
the fragmentation of care

00:01:41.617 --> 00:01:45.347
and the often very difficult course
of adoption of innovation.

00:01:45.371 --> 00:01:49.166
And one of the major things we can do
is move the curve to the left.

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:51.907
We spend most of our money
on the last 20 percent of life.

00:01:51.931 --> 00:01:54.991
What if we could incentivize physicians
in the health care system

00:01:55.015 --> 00:01:56.171
and our own selves

00:01:56.195 --> 00:01:58.710
to move the curve to the left
and improve our health,

00:01:58.734 --> 00:02:00.178
leveraging technology as well?

00:02:00.202 --> 00:02:02.626
Now my favorite example
of exponential technology,

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:03.950
we all have in our pocket.

00:02:03.974 --> 00:02:07.245
If you think about it,
these are really dramatically improving.

00:02:07.269 --> 00:02:09.175
I mean, this is the iPhone 4.

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:12.387
Imagine what the iPhone 8
will be able to do.

00:02:12.411 --> 00:02:14.329
Now, I've gained some insight into this.

00:02:14.353 --> 00:02:16.928
I've been the track share
for the medicine portion

00:02:16.952 --> 00:02:19.459
of a new institution
called Singularity University,

00:02:19.483 --> 00:02:20.872
based in Silicon Valley.

00:02:20.896 --> 00:02:23.856
We bring together each summer
about 100 very talented students

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:25.046
from around the world.

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:27.936
And we look at these exponential
technologies from medicine,

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:31.106
biotech, artificial intelligence,
robotics, nanotechnology, space,

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:33.609
and address how we can cross-train
and leverage these

00:02:33.633 --> 00:02:34.973
to impact major unmet goals.

00:02:34.997 --> 00:02:37.004
We also have seven-day executive programs.

00:02:37.028 --> 00:02:39.411
And coming up next month is FutureMed,

00:02:39.435 --> 00:02:42.809
a program to help cross-train
and leverage technologies into medicine.

00:02:42.833 --> 00:02:44.354
Now, I mentioned the phone.

00:02:44.378 --> 00:02:47.689
These mobile phones have over 20,000
different mobile apps available.

00:02:47.713 --> 00:02:50.955
There's one out of the UK
where you can pee on a little chip,

00:02:50.979 --> 00:02:52.260
connect it to your iPhone,

00:02:52.284 --> 00:02:53.439
and check for an STD.

00:02:53.463 --> 00:02:55.766
I don't know if I'd try that,
but it's available.

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:57.615
There are other sorts of applications.

00:02:57.639 --> 00:02:59.915
Merging your phone
and diagnostics, for example,

00:02:59.939 --> 00:03:01.980
measuring your blood glucose
on your iPhone

00:03:02.004 --> 00:03:03.711
and sending that to your physician,

00:03:03.735 --> 00:03:06.502
so they can better understand
and you can better understand

00:03:06.526 --> 00:03:08.106
your blood sugars as a diabetic.

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:11.251
So let's see how exponential
technologies are taking health care.

00:03:11.275 --> 00:03:12.441
Let's start with faster.

00:03:12.465 --> 00:03:14.874
It's no secret that computers,
through Moore's law,

00:03:14.898 --> 00:03:16.541
are speeding up faster and faster.

00:03:16.565 --> 00:03:18.626
We can do more powerful things with them.

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:21.451
They're really approaching --
in many cases, surpassing --

00:03:21.475 --> 00:03:22.921
the ability of the human mind.

00:03:22.945 --> 00:03:26.779
But where I think computational speed
is most applicable is in imaging.

00:03:26.803 --> 00:03:29.435
The ability now to look
inside the body in real time

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:30.917
with very high resolution

00:03:30.941 --> 00:03:32.401
is really becoming incredible.

00:03:32.425 --> 00:03:35.461
And we're layering multiple
technologies -- PET scans, CT scans

00:03:35.485 --> 00:03:37.507
and molecular diagnostics --

00:03:37.531 --> 00:03:39.796
to find and seek things
at different levels.

00:03:40.356 --> 00:03:43.807
Here you're going to see the very highest
resolution MRI scan done today,

00:03:43.831 --> 00:03:46.650
of Marc Hodosh, the curator of TEDMED.

00:03:46.674 --> 00:03:48.817
And now we can see inside of the brain

00:03:48.841 --> 00:03:51.433
at a resolution and ability
never before available,

00:03:51.457 --> 00:03:55.523
and essentially learn how to reconstruct
and maybe even reengineer

00:03:55.547 --> 00:03:57.231
or backwards engineer the brain,

00:03:57.255 --> 00:04:00.232
so we can better understand
pathology, disease and therapy.

00:04:00.256 --> 00:04:03.548
We can look inside with real-time
fMRI in the brain at real time.

00:04:03.572 --> 00:04:06.861
And by understanding these sorts
of processes and these connections,

00:04:06.885 --> 00:04:09.948
we're going to understand the effects
of medication or meditation

00:04:09.972 --> 00:04:12.579
and better personalize
and make effective, for example,

00:04:12.603 --> 00:04:14.206
psychoactive drugs.

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:16.998
The scanners for these are getting
smaller, less expensive

00:04:17.022 --> 00:04:18.173
and more portable.

00:04:18.197 --> 00:04:20.668
And this sort of data explosion
available from these

00:04:20.692 --> 00:04:22.626
is really almost becoming a challenge.

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:25.627
The scan of today takes up
about 800 books, or 20 gigabytes.

00:04:25.651 --> 00:04:28.922
The scan in a couple of years
will be one terabyte, or 800,000 books.

00:04:28.946 --> 00:04:30.715
How do you leverage that information?

00:04:30.739 --> 00:04:31.890
Let's get personal.

00:04:31.914 --> 00:04:35.121
I won't ask who here's had a colonoscopy,
but if you're over age 50,

00:04:35.145 --> 00:04:37.138
it's time for your screening colonoscopy.

00:04:37.162 --> 00:04:39.593
How'd you like to avoid
the pointy end of the stick?

00:04:39.617 --> 00:04:41.668
Now there's essentially
virtual colonoscopy.

00:04:41.692 --> 00:04:42.983
Compare those two pictures.

00:04:43.007 --> 00:04:46.274
As a radiologist, you can basically
fly through your patient's colon,

00:04:46.298 --> 00:04:48.593
and augmenting that
with artificial intelligence,

00:04:48.617 --> 00:04:51.246
potentially identify a lesion
that we might have missed,

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:52.846
but using AI on top of radiology,

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:54.921
we can find lesions
that were missed before.

00:04:54.945 --> 00:04:57.472
Maybe this will encourage
people to get colonoscopies

00:04:57.496 --> 00:04:58.879
that wouldn't have otherwise.

00:04:58.903 --> 00:05:00.915
This is an example of this paradigm shift.

00:05:00.939 --> 00:05:04.340
We're moving to this integration
of biomedicine, information technology,

00:05:04.364 --> 00:05:07.670
wireless and, I would say, mobile now --
this era of digital medicine.

00:05:07.694 --> 00:05:11.238
Even my stethoscope is now digital,
and of course, there's an app for that.

00:05:11.262 --> 00:05:13.797
We're moving, obviously,
to the era of the tricorder.

00:05:13.821 --> 00:05:16.270
So the handheld ultrasound
is basically surpassing

00:05:16.294 --> 00:05:18.292
and supplanting the stethoscope.

00:05:18.316 --> 00:05:21.278
These are now at a price point
of what used to be 100,000 euros

00:05:21.302 --> 00:05:23.141
or a couple hundred-thousand dollars.

00:05:23.165 --> 00:05:24.318
For about 5,000 dollars,

00:05:24.342 --> 00:05:27.668
I can have the power of a very powerful
diagnostic device in my hand.

00:05:27.692 --> 00:05:30.784
Merging this now with the advent
of electronic medical records --

00:05:30.808 --> 00:05:33.389
in the US, we're still
less than 20 percent electronic;

00:05:33.413 --> 00:05:36.209
here in the Netherlands,
I think it's more than 80 percent.

00:05:36.233 --> 00:05:38.521
Now that we're switching
to merging medical data,

00:05:38.545 --> 00:05:40.220
making it available electronically,

00:05:40.244 --> 00:05:42.892
we can crowd-source the information,
and as a physician,

00:05:42.916 --> 00:05:45.252
I can access my patients' data
from wherever I am,

00:05:45.276 --> 00:05:46.706
just through my mobile device.

00:05:46.730 --> 00:05:49.843
And now, of course, we're in the era
of the iPad, even the iPad 2.

00:05:49.867 --> 00:05:51.018
Just last month,

00:05:51.042 --> 00:05:53.257
the first FDA-approved
application was approved

00:05:53.281 --> 00:05:56.774
to allow radiologists to do actual
reading on these sorts of devices.

00:05:56.798 --> 00:05:59.419
So certainly, the physicians
of today, including myself,

00:05:59.443 --> 00:06:01.420
are completely reliable on these devices.

00:06:01.444 --> 00:06:03.263
And as you saw just about a month ago,

00:06:03.287 --> 00:06:05.780
Watson from IBM beat
the two champions in "Jeopardy."

00:06:05.804 --> 00:06:08.242
So I want you to imagine
when, in a couple of years,

00:06:08.266 --> 00:06:10.726
we've started to apply
this cloud-based information,

00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:14.350
when we really have the AI physician
and leverage our brains to connectivity

00:06:14.374 --> 00:06:17.324
to make decisions and diagnostics
at a level never done.

00:06:17.348 --> 00:06:20.547
Already today, you don't need to go
to your physician in many cases.

00:06:20.571 --> 00:06:24.113
Only in about 20 percent of visits
do you need to lay hands on the patient.

00:06:24.137 --> 00:06:25.998
We're now in the era of virtual visits.

00:06:26.022 --> 00:06:28.515
From Skype-type visits
you can do with American Well,

00:06:28.539 --> 00:06:31.596
to Cisco, that's developed a very complex
health presence system,

00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:34.827
the ability to interact with
your health care provider is different.

00:06:34.851 --> 00:06:37.876
And these are being augmented
even by our devices, again, today.

00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:40.669
My friend Jessica sent me
a picture of her head laceration,

00:06:40.693 --> 00:06:42.901
so I can save her a trip
to the emergency room,

00:06:42.925 --> 00:06:44.354
and do diagnostics that way.

00:06:44.378 --> 00:06:46.772
Or maybe we can leverage
today's gaming technology,

00:06:46.796 --> 00:06:48.042
like the Microsoft Kinect,

00:06:48.066 --> 00:06:51.243
hack that to enable diagnostics,
for example, in diagnosing stroke,

00:06:51.267 --> 00:06:53.856
using simple motion detection,
using $100 devices.

00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:57.065
We can actually now visit
our patients robotically.

00:06:57.089 --> 00:06:58.240
This is the RP7;

00:06:58.264 --> 00:07:01.222
if I'm a hematologist,
I can visit another clinic or hospital.

00:07:01.246 --> 00:07:03.641
These are being augmented
by a whole suite of tools

00:07:03.665 --> 00:07:04.861
actually in the home now.

00:07:04.885 --> 00:07:06.739
We already have wireless scales.

00:07:06.763 --> 00:07:09.468
You step on the scale,
tweet your weight to your friends,

00:07:09.492 --> 00:07:10.734
they can keep you in line.

00:07:10.758 --> 00:07:12.576
We have wireless blood pressure cuffs.

00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:15.107
A whole gamut of technologies
are being put together.

00:07:15.131 --> 00:07:17.945
Instead of wearing kludgy devices,
we put on a simple patch.

00:07:17.969 --> 00:07:19.462
This was developed at Stanford.

00:07:19.486 --> 00:07:22.565
It's called iRhythm; it completely
supplants the prior technology

00:07:22.589 --> 00:07:25.241
at a much lower price point,
with much more effectivity.

00:07:25.265 --> 00:07:27.740
We're also in the era today
of quantified self.

00:07:27.764 --> 00:07:31.369
Consumers now can basically buy
$100 devices, like this little Fitbit.

00:07:31.393 --> 00:07:33.414
I can measure my steps,
my caloric outtake.

00:07:33.438 --> 00:07:35.491
I can get insight into that
on a daily basis

00:07:35.515 --> 00:07:37.523
and share it with my friends or physician.

00:07:37.547 --> 00:07:40.626
There's watches that measure
your heart rate, Zeo sleep monitors,

00:07:40.650 --> 00:07:42.733
a suite of tools
that enable you to leverage

00:07:42.757 --> 00:07:44.571
and have insight into your own health.

00:07:44.595 --> 00:07:46.603
As we start to integrate this information,

00:07:46.627 --> 00:07:49.508
we'll know better what to do with it,
and have better insight

00:07:49.532 --> 00:07:51.959
into our own pathologies,
health and wellness.

00:07:51.983 --> 00:07:54.626
There's even mirrors
that can pick up your pulse rate.

00:07:54.650 --> 00:07:56.409
And I would argue, in the future,

00:07:56.433 --> 00:07:59.595
we'll have wearable devices
in our clothes, monitoring us 24/7.

00:07:59.619 --> 00:08:03.036
And just like the OnStar system
in cars, your red light might go on.

00:08:03.060 --> 00:08:06.105
It won't say "check engine";
it'll be a "check your body" light,

00:08:06.129 --> 00:08:07.813
and you'll go get it taken care of.

00:08:07.837 --> 00:08:09.010
Probably in a few years,

00:08:09.034 --> 00:08:11.840
you'll look in your mirror
and it'll be diagnosing you.

00:08:11.864 --> 00:08:13.086
(Laughter)

00:08:13.110 --> 00:08:15.189
For those of you with kiddos at home,

00:08:15.213 --> 00:08:18.158
how would you like a wireless
diaper that supports your --

00:08:18.182 --> 00:08:19.242
(Laughter)

00:08:19.266 --> 00:08:21.463
More information, I think,
than you might need,

00:08:21.487 --> 00:08:22.924
but it's going to be here.

00:08:22.948 --> 00:08:26.048
Now, we've heard a lot today
about technology and connection.

00:08:26.072 --> 00:08:27.884
And I think some of these technologies

00:08:27.908 --> 00:08:31.326
will enable us to be more connected
with our patients, to take more time

00:08:31.350 --> 00:08:33.931
and do the important
human-touch elements of medicine,

00:08:33.955 --> 00:08:35.633
as augmented by these technologies.

00:08:35.657 --> 00:08:38.026
Now, we've talked about
augmenting the patient.

00:08:38.050 --> 00:08:39.726
How about augmenting the physician?

00:08:39.750 --> 00:08:42.140
We're now in the era
of super-enabling the surgeon,

00:08:42.164 --> 00:08:45.626
who can now go into the body and do
robotic surgery, which is here today,

00:08:45.650 --> 00:08:49.113
at a level that was not really possible
even five years ago.

00:08:49.137 --> 00:08:52.257
And now this is being augmented
with further layers of technology,

00:08:52.281 --> 00:08:53.436
like augmented reality.

00:08:53.460 --> 00:08:56.391
So the surgeon can see
inside the patient, through their lens,

00:08:56.415 --> 00:08:58.726
where the tumor is,
where the blood vessels are.

00:08:58.750 --> 00:09:00.855
This can be integrated
with decision support.

00:09:00.879 --> 00:09:04.040
A surgeon in New York can help
a surgeon in Amsterdam, for example.

00:09:04.064 --> 00:09:07.440
And we're entering an era
of truly scarless surgery called NOTES,

00:09:07.464 --> 00:09:10.055
where the robotic endoscope
can come out the stomach

00:09:10.079 --> 00:09:11.527
and pull out that gallbladder,

00:09:11.551 --> 00:09:13.902
all in a scarless way and robotically.

00:09:13.926 --> 00:09:17.242
This is called NOTES, and it's coming --
basically scarless surgery,

00:09:17.266 --> 00:09:19.324
as mediated by robotic surgery.

00:09:19.348 --> 00:09:21.444
Now, how about controlling other elements?

00:09:21.468 --> 00:09:23.898
For those who have
disabilities -- the paraplegic,

00:09:23.922 --> 00:09:26.709
there's the brain-computer
interface, or BCI,

00:09:26.733 --> 00:09:28.922
where chips have been put
on the motor cortex

00:09:28.946 --> 00:09:30.766
of completely quadriplegic patients,

00:09:30.790 --> 00:09:33.450
and they can control
a cursor or a wheelchair

00:09:33.474 --> 00:09:35.007
or, potentially, a robotic arm.

00:09:35.031 --> 00:09:36.627
These devices are getting smaller

00:09:36.651 --> 00:09:38.878
and going into more and more
of these patients.

00:09:38.902 --> 00:09:40.114
Still in clinical trials,

00:09:40.138 --> 00:09:42.539
but imagine when we can connect
these, for example,

00:09:42.563 --> 00:09:44.179
to the amazing bionic limb,

00:09:44.203 --> 00:09:47.025
such as the DEKA Arm,
built by Dean Kamen and colleagues,

00:09:47.049 --> 00:09:49.069
which has 17 degrees
of motion and freedom,

00:09:49.093 --> 00:09:51.121
and can allow the person who's lost a limb

00:09:51.145 --> 00:09:54.480
to have much higher dexterity or control
than they've had in the past.

00:09:54.504 --> 00:09:57.548
So we're really entering the era
of wearable robotics, actually.

00:09:57.572 --> 00:09:59.786
If you haven't lost a limb
but had a stroke,

00:09:59.810 --> 00:10:01.497
you can wear these augmented limbs.

00:10:01.521 --> 00:10:05.017
Or if you're a paraplegic -- I've visited
the folks at Berkeley Bionics --

00:10:05.041 --> 00:10:06.210
they've developed eLEGS.

00:10:06.234 --> 00:10:07.600
I took this video last week.

00:10:07.624 --> 00:10:11.409
Here's a paraplegic patient, walking
by strapping on these exoskeletons.

00:10:11.433 --> 00:10:13.444
He's otherwise completely
wheelchair-bound.

00:10:13.468 --> 00:10:15.484
This is the early era
of wearable robotics.

00:10:15.508 --> 00:10:17.787
And by leveraging
these sorts of technologies,

00:10:17.811 --> 00:10:20.148
we're going to change
the definition of disability

00:10:20.172 --> 00:10:22.702
to, in some cases, be superability,
or super-enabling.

00:10:22.726 --> 00:10:25.916
This is Aimee Mullins, who lost
her lower limbs as a young child,

00:10:25.940 --> 00:10:28.253
and Hugh Herr, who's a professor at MIT,

00:10:28.277 --> 00:10:30.278
who lost his limbs in a climbing accident.

00:10:30.302 --> 00:10:33.697
And now both of them can climb better,
move faster, swim differently

00:10:33.721 --> 00:10:37.208
with their prosthetics
than us normal-abled persons.

00:10:37.232 --> 00:10:38.672
How about other exponentials?

00:10:38.696 --> 00:10:42.106
Clearly the obesity trend is exponentially
going in the wrong direction,

00:10:42.130 --> 00:10:43.565
including with huge costs.

00:10:43.589 --> 00:10:46.712
But the trend in medicine
is to get exponentially smaller.

00:10:46.736 --> 00:10:50.311
A few examples: we're now in the era
of "Fantastic Voyage," the iPill.

00:10:50.335 --> 00:10:52.736
You can swallow this
completely integrated device.

00:10:52.760 --> 00:10:54.626
It can take pictures of your GI system,

00:10:54.650 --> 00:10:57.406
help diagnose and treat
as it moves through your GI tract.

00:10:57.430 --> 00:10:59.249
We get into even smaller micro-robots

00:10:59.273 --> 00:11:02.170
that will eventually, autonomously,
move through your system,

00:11:02.194 --> 00:11:04.251
and be able to do things surgeons can't do

00:11:04.275 --> 00:11:05.811
in a much less invasive manner.

00:11:05.835 --> 00:11:08.424
Sometimes these might
self-assemble in your GI system,

00:11:08.448 --> 00:11:10.172
and be augmented in that reality.

00:11:10.196 --> 00:11:12.688
On the cardiac side,
pacemakers are getting smaller

00:11:12.712 --> 00:11:14.049
and much easier to place,

00:11:14.073 --> 00:11:17.156
so no need to train an interventional
cardiologist to place them.

00:11:17.180 --> 00:11:20.116
And they'll be wirelessly telemetered
to your mobile devices,

00:11:20.140 --> 00:11:22.626
so you can go places
and be monitored remotely.

00:11:22.650 --> 00:11:24.248
These are shrinking even further.

00:11:24.272 --> 00:11:27.528
This one is in prototyping
by Medtronic; it's smaller than a penny.

00:11:27.552 --> 00:11:30.977
Artificial retinas, the ability to put
arrays on the back of the eyeball

00:11:31.001 --> 00:11:32.425
and allow the blind to see --

00:11:32.449 --> 00:11:34.760
also in early trials,
but moving into the future.

00:11:34.784 --> 00:11:36.515
These are going to be game-changing.

00:11:36.539 --> 00:11:38.227
Or for those of us who are sighted,

00:11:38.251 --> 00:11:40.613
how about having
the assisted-living contact lens?

00:11:40.637 --> 00:11:43.459
Bluetooth, Wi-Fi available --
beams back images to your eye.

00:11:43.483 --> 00:11:44.506
(Laughter)

00:11:44.530 --> 00:11:46.733
Now, if you have trouble
maintaining your diet,

00:11:46.757 --> 00:11:48.713
it might help to have some extra imagery

00:11:48.737 --> 00:11:52.371
to remind you how many calories
are going to be coming at you.

00:11:52.395 --> 00:11:55.146
How about enabling the pathologist
to use their cell phone

00:11:55.170 --> 00:11:56.716
to see at a microscopic level

00:11:56.740 --> 00:12:00.054
and to lumber that data back to the cloud
and make better diagnostics?

00:12:00.078 --> 00:12:02.364
In fact, the whole era
of laboratory medicine

00:12:02.388 --> 00:12:03.540
is completely changing.

00:12:03.564 --> 00:12:05.517
We can now leverage microfluidics,

00:12:05.541 --> 00:12:07.758
like this chip made
by Steve Quake at Stanford.

00:12:07.782 --> 00:12:10.418
Microfluidics can replace
an entire lab of technicians;

00:12:10.442 --> 00:12:13.581
put it on a chip, enable thousands
of tests at the point of care,

00:12:13.605 --> 00:12:14.757
anywhere in the world.

00:12:14.781 --> 00:12:18.185
This will really leverage technology
to the rural and the underserved

00:12:18.209 --> 00:12:21.724
and enable what used to be thousand-dollar
tests to be done for pennies,

00:12:21.748 --> 00:12:23.100
and at the point of care.

00:12:23.124 --> 00:12:25.625
If we go down the small
pathway a little bit further,

00:12:25.649 --> 00:12:27.548
we're entering the era of nanomedicine,

00:12:27.572 --> 00:12:29.494
the ability to make devices super-small,

00:12:29.518 --> 00:12:31.838
to the point where we can
design red blood cells

00:12:31.862 --> 00:12:34.937
or microrobots that monitor
our blood system or immune system,

00:12:34.961 --> 00:12:38.049
or even those that might clear out
the clots from our arteries.

00:12:38.073 --> 00:12:39.813
Now how about exponentially cheaper?

00:12:39.837 --> 00:12:42.670
Not something we usually think
about in the era of medicine,

00:12:42.694 --> 00:12:46.598
but hard disks used to be 3,400 dollars
for 10 megabytes -- exponentially cheaper.

00:12:46.622 --> 00:12:49.284
In genomics now, the genome
cost about a billion dollars

00:12:49.308 --> 00:12:51.567
about 10 years ago,
when the first one came out.

00:12:51.591 --> 00:12:54.955
We're now approaching essentially
a $1,000 genome, probably next year.

00:12:54.979 --> 00:12:56.512
And in two years, a $100 genome.

00:12:56.536 --> 00:12:58.260
What will we do with $100 genomes?

00:12:58.284 --> 00:13:00.638
Soon we'll have millions
of these tests available.

00:13:00.662 --> 00:13:04.153
Then it gets interesting, when we start
to crowd-source that information,

00:13:04.177 --> 00:13:06.423
and enter the era
of true personalized medicine:

00:13:06.447 --> 00:13:08.979
the right drug for the right person
at the right time,

00:13:09.003 --> 00:13:12.296
instead of what we're doing now,
which is the same drug for everybody,

00:13:12.320 --> 00:13:15.426
blockbuster drug medications,
which don't work for the individual.

00:13:15.450 --> 00:13:18.669
Many different companies are working
on leveraging these approaches.

00:13:18.693 --> 00:13:21.098
I'll show you a simple example,
from 23andMe again.

00:13:21.122 --> 00:13:23.232
My data indicates
I've got about average risk

00:13:23.256 --> 00:13:25.947
for developing macular degeneration,
a kind of blindness.

00:13:25.971 --> 00:13:28.597
But if I take that same data,
upload it to deCODEme,

00:13:28.621 --> 00:13:32.876
I can look at my risk for type 2 diabetes;
I'm at almost twice the risk.

00:13:32.900 --> 00:13:36.117
I might want to watch how much dessert
I have at lunch, for example.

00:13:36.141 --> 00:13:37.492
It might change my behavior.

00:13:37.516 --> 00:13:39.758
Leveraging my knowledge
of my pharmacogenomics:

00:13:39.782 --> 00:13:43.117
how my genes modulate,
what my drugs do and what doses I need

00:13:43.141 --> 00:13:44.832
will become increasingly important,

00:13:44.856 --> 00:13:47.207
and once in the hands
of individuals and patients,

00:13:47.231 --> 00:13:49.753
will make better drug dosing
and selection available.

00:13:49.777 --> 00:13:52.619
So again, it's not just genes,
it's multiple details --

00:13:52.643 --> 00:13:54.762
our habits, our environmental exposures.

00:13:54.786 --> 00:13:57.597
When was the last time your doctor
asked where you've lived?

00:13:57.621 --> 00:14:00.332
Geomedicine: where you live,
what you've been exposed to,

00:14:00.356 --> 00:14:02.073
can dramatically affect your health.

00:14:02.097 --> 00:14:03.628
We can capture that information.

00:14:03.652 --> 00:14:05.561
Genomics, proteomics, the environment --

00:14:05.585 --> 00:14:08.450
all this data streaming at us
individually and as physicians:

00:14:08.474 --> 00:14:09.626
How do we manage it?

00:14:09.650 --> 00:14:12.712
We're now entering the era
of systems medicine, systems biology,

00:14:12.736 --> 00:14:15.237
where we can start to integrate
all this information.

00:14:15.261 --> 00:14:18.069
And by looking at the patterns,
for example, in our blood,

00:14:18.093 --> 00:14:19.906
of 10,000 biomarkers in a single test,

00:14:19.930 --> 00:14:23.465
we can look at patterns and detect disease
at a much earlier stage.

00:14:23.489 --> 00:14:26.923
This is called by Lee Hood,
the father of the field, P4 Medicine.

00:14:26.947 --> 00:14:29.573
We'll be predictive and know
what you're likely to have.

00:14:29.597 --> 00:14:32.420
We can be preventative;
that prevention can be personalized.

00:14:32.444 --> 00:14:34.973
More importantly,
it'll be increasingly participatory.

00:14:34.997 --> 00:14:36.836
Through websites like PatientsLikeMe

00:14:36.860 --> 00:14:39.971
or managing your data on Microsoft
HealthVault or Google Health,

00:14:39.995 --> 00:14:42.142
leveraging this together
in participatory ways

00:14:42.166 --> 00:14:43.650
will be increasingly important.

00:14:43.674 --> 00:14:45.630
I'll finish up with exponentially better.

00:14:45.654 --> 00:14:48.171
We'd like to get therapies
better and more effective.

00:14:48.195 --> 00:14:50.676
Today we treat high blood pressure
mostly with pills.

00:14:50.700 --> 00:14:52.087
What if we take a new device,

00:14:52.111 --> 00:14:54.997
knock out the nerve vessels
that help mediate blood pressure,

00:14:55.021 --> 00:14:57.626
and in a single therapy,
basically cure hypertension?

00:14:57.650 --> 00:14:59.711
This is a new device
doing essentially that.

00:14:59.735 --> 00:15:01.797
It should be on the market
in a year or two.

00:15:01.821 --> 00:15:03.925
How about more targeted
therapies for cancer?

00:15:03.949 --> 00:15:07.498
I'm an oncologist and know that most
of what we give is essentially poison.

00:15:07.522 --> 00:15:11.311
We learned at Stanford and other places
that we can discover cancer stem cells,

00:15:11.335 --> 00:15:14.563
the ones that seem to be really
responsible for disease relapse.

00:15:14.587 --> 00:15:16.506
So if you think of cancer as a weed,

00:15:16.530 --> 00:15:19.423
we often can whack the weed away
and it seems to shrink,

00:15:19.447 --> 00:15:20.615
but it often comes back.

00:15:20.639 --> 00:15:22.376
So we're attacking the wrong target.

00:15:22.400 --> 00:15:23.862
The cancer stem cells remain,

00:15:23.886 --> 00:15:26.142
and the tumor can return
months or years later.

00:15:26.166 --> 00:15:28.647
We're now learning to identify
the cancer stem cells

00:15:28.671 --> 00:15:31.787
and identify those as targets
and go for the long-term cure.

00:15:31.811 --> 00:15:34.104
We're entering the era
of personalized oncology,

00:15:34.128 --> 00:15:36.491
the ability to leverage
all of this data together,

00:15:36.515 --> 00:15:37.666
analyze the tumor

00:15:37.690 --> 00:15:41.004
and come up with a real, specific cocktail
for the individual patient.

00:15:41.028 --> 00:15:42.861
I'll close with regenerative medicine.

00:15:42.885 --> 00:15:44.627
I've studied a lot about stem cells.

00:15:44.651 --> 00:15:46.853
Embryonic stem cells
are particularly powerful.

00:15:46.877 --> 00:15:48.988
We have adult stem cells
throughout our body;

00:15:49.012 --> 00:15:51.137
we use those in bone marrow
transplantation.

00:15:51.161 --> 00:15:54.963
Geron, last year, started the first trial
using human embryonic stem cells

00:15:54.987 --> 00:15:56.552
to treat spinal cord injuries.

00:15:56.576 --> 00:15:58.626
Still a phase I trial, but evolving.

00:15:58.650 --> 00:16:02.423
We've been using adult stem cells
in clinical trials for about 15 years

00:16:02.447 --> 00:16:06.026
to approach a whole range of topics,
particularly cardiovascular disease.

00:16:06.050 --> 00:16:09.766
If we take our own bone marrow cells
and treat a patient with a heart attack,

00:16:09.790 --> 00:16:12.702
we can see much improved
heart function and better survival

00:16:12.726 --> 00:16:15.679
using our own bone marrow derived cells
after a heart attack.

00:16:15.703 --> 00:16:17.739
I invented a device
called the MarrowMiner,

00:16:17.763 --> 00:16:20.200
a much less invasive way
for harvesting bone marrow.

00:16:20.224 --> 00:16:23.483
It's now been FDA approved;
hopefully on the market in the next year.

00:16:23.507 --> 00:16:25.384
Hopefully you can appreciate the device

00:16:25.408 --> 00:16:29.178
going through the patient's body removing
bone marrow, not with 200 punctures,

00:16:29.202 --> 00:16:31.595
but with a single puncture,
under local anesthesia.

00:16:31.619 --> 00:16:33.203
Where is stem-cell therapy going?

00:16:33.227 --> 00:16:34.378
If you think about it,

00:16:34.402 --> 00:16:37.877
every cell in your body has the same DNA
you had when you were an embryo.

00:16:37.901 --> 00:16:39.845
We can now reprogram your skin cells

00:16:39.869 --> 00:16:42.782
to actually act like a pluripotent
embryonic stem cell

00:16:42.806 --> 00:16:46.454
and utilize those, potentially, to treat
multiple organs in the same patient,

00:16:46.478 --> 00:16:48.201
making personalized stem cell lines.

00:16:48.225 --> 00:16:51.010
I think there'll be a new era
of your own stem cell banking

00:16:51.034 --> 00:16:54.502
to have in the freezer your own cardiac
cells, myocytes and neural cells

00:16:54.526 --> 00:16:56.879
to use them in the future,
should you need them.

00:16:56.903 --> 00:17:00.125
We're integrating this now
with a whole era of cellular engineering,

00:17:00.149 --> 00:17:03.717
and integrating exponential technologies
for essentially 3D organ printing,

00:17:03.741 --> 00:17:05.425
replacing the ink with cells,

00:17:05.449 --> 00:17:08.246
and essentially building
and reconstructing a 3D organ.

00:17:08.270 --> 00:17:09.796
That's where things are heading.

00:17:09.820 --> 00:17:10.981
Still very early days,

00:17:11.005 --> 00:17:13.752
but I think, as integration
of exponential technologies,

00:17:13.776 --> 00:17:14.940
this is the example.

00:17:14.964 --> 00:17:17.451
So in closing, as you think
about technology trends

00:17:17.475 --> 00:17:19.315
and how to impact health and medicine,

00:17:19.339 --> 00:17:21.316
we're entering an era of miniaturization,

00:17:21.340 --> 00:17:23.562
decentralization and personalization.

00:17:23.586 --> 00:17:25.394
And by pulling these things together,

00:17:25.418 --> 00:17:28.403
if we start to think about
how to understand and leverage them,

00:17:28.427 --> 00:17:31.778
we're going to empower the patient,
enable the doctor, enhance wellness

00:17:31.802 --> 00:17:34.249
and begin to cure the well
before they get sick.

00:17:34.273 --> 00:17:37.811
Because I know as a doctor, if someone
comes to me with stage I disease,

00:17:37.835 --> 00:17:39.626
I'm thrilled; we can often cure them.

00:17:39.650 --> 00:17:40.820
But often it's too late,

00:17:40.844 --> 00:17:42.973
and it's stage III or IV
cancer, for example.

00:17:42.997 --> 00:17:45.112
So by leveraging
these technologies together,

00:17:45.136 --> 00:17:48.373
I think we'll enter a new era
that I like to call stage 0 medicine.

00:17:48.397 --> 00:17:51.666
And as a cancer doctor,
I'm looking forward to being out of a job.

00:17:51.690 --> 00:17:52.912
Thanks very much.

00:17:52.936 --> 00:17:54.914
(Applause)

00:17:54.938 --> 00:17:56.635
Host: Thank you. Thank you.

00:17:56.659 --> 00:17:58.459
(Applause)

00:17:58.483 --> 00:18:00.483
Take a bow, take a bow.
