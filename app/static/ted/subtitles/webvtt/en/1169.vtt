00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
I'm a contemporary artist

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
with a bit of an unexpected background.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
I was in my 20s before I ever went to an art museum.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
I grew up in the middle of nowhere

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
on a dirt road in rural Arkansas,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
an hour from the nearest movie theater.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
And I think it was a great place to grow up as an artist

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
because I grew up around quirky, colorful characters

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
who were great at making with their hands.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
And my childhood is more hick

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
than I could ever possibly relate to you,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
and also more intellectual than you would ever expect.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
For instance, me and my sister, when we were little,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
we would compete to see who could eat the most squirrel brains.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
(Laughter)

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
But on the other side of that, though,

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
we were big readers in our house.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
And if the TV was on, we were watching a documentary.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
And my dad is the most voracious reader I know.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
He can read a novel or two a day.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
But when I was little, I remember,

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
he would kill flies in our house with my BB gun.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
And what was so amazing to me about that --

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
well he would be in his recliner, would holler for me to fetch the BB gun,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
and I'd go get it.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
And what was amazing to me --

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
well it was pretty kickass; he was killing a fly in the house with a gun --

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
but what was so amazing to me

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
was that he knew just enough how to pump it.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
And he could shoot it from two rooms away

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
and not damage what it was on

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
because he knew how to pump it just enough to kill the fly

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
and not damage what it landed on.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
So I should talk about art.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
(Laughter)

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
Or we'll be here all day with my childhood stories.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
I love contemporary art,

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
but I'm often really frustrated with the contemporary art world

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
and the contemporary art scene.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
A few years ago,

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
I spent months in Europe

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
to see the major international art exhibitions

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
that have the pulse

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
of what is supposed to be going on in the art world.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
And I was struck

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
by going to so many, one after the other,

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
with some clarity of what it was

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
that I was longing for.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
And I was longing for several things that I wasn't getting,

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
or not getting enough of.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
But two of the main things:

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
one of it, I was longing for more work

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
that was appealing to a broad public,

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
that was accessible.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
And the second thing that I was longing for

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
was some more exquisite craftsmanship

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000
and technique.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000
So I started thinking and listing

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000
what all it was that I thought would make a perfect biennial.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
So I decided,

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
I'm going to start my own biennial.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
I'm going to organize it and direct it

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000
and get it going in the world.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
So I thought, okay,

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
I have to have some criteria of how to choose work.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
So amongst all the criteria I have,

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000
there's two main things.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
One of them, I call my Mimaw's Test.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
And what that is

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
is I imagine explaining a work of art

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
to my grandmother in five minutes,

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
and if I can't explain it in five minutes,

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000
then it's too obtuse

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
or esoteric

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
and it hasn't been refined enough yet.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
It needs to worked on

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000
until it can speak fluently.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000
And then my other second set of rules --

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000
I hate to say "rules" because it's art --

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000
my criteria would be

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
the three H's,

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
which is head, heart and hands.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000
And great art would have "head":

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
it would have interesting intellectual ideas

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000
and concepts.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000
It would have "heart" in that it would have passion

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000
and heart and soul.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.000
And it would have "hand" in that it would be greatly crafted.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
So I started thinking about

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
how am I going to do this biennial,

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
how am I going to travel the world

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000
and find these artists?

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.000
And then I realized one day, there's an easier solution to this.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000
I'm just going to make the whole thing myself.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000
(Laughter)

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.000
And so this is what I did.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000
So I thought, a biennial needs artists.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.000
I'm going to do an international biennial; I need artists from all around the world.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000
So what I did was

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000
I invented a hundred artists from around the world.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
I figured out their bios, their passions in life

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
and their art styles,

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.000
and I started making their work.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000
(Laughter)

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.000
(Applause)

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.000
I felt, oh this is the kind of project that I could spend my whole life doing.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000
So I decided, I'm going to make this a real biennial.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000
It's going to be two years of studio work.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000
And I'm going to create this in two years,

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000
and I have.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.000
So I should start to talk about these guys.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.000
Well the range is quite a bit.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000
And I'm such a technician, so I loved this project,

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000
getting to play with all the techniques.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
So for example, in realist paintings,

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000
it ranges from this,

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000
which is kind of old masters style,

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.000
to really realistic still-life,

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.000
to this type of painting where I'm painting with a single hair.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.000
And then at the other end, there's performance and short films

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000
and indoor installations

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000
like this indoor installation

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.000
and this one,

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.000
and outdoor installations like this one

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000
and this one.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000
I know I should mention: I'm making all these things.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000
This isn't Photoshopped.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000
I'm under the river with those fish.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.000
So now let me introduce some of my fictional artists to you.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000
This is Nell Remmel.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000
Nell is interested in agricultural processes,

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.000
and her work is based in these practices.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000
This piece, which is called "Flipped Earth" --

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.000
she was interested in taking the sky

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.000
and using it to cleanse barren ground.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.000
And by taking giant mirrors --

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000
(Applause)

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000
and here she's taking giant mirrors

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.000
and pulling them into the dirt.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.000
And this is 22 feet long.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000
And what I loved about her work

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.000
is, when I would walk around it

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000
and look down into the sky,

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000
looking down to watch the sky,

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.000
and it unfolded in a new way.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000
And probably the best part of this piece

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.000
is at dusk and dawn

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.000
when the twilight wedge has fallen and the ground's dark,

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000
but there's still the light above, bright above.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.000
And so you're standing there and everything else is dark,

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000
but there's this portal that you want to jump in.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.000
This piece was great. This is in my parents' backyard in Arkansas.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000
And I love to dig a hole.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.000
So this piece was great fun

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.000
because it was two days of digging in soft dirt.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000
The next artist is Kay Overstry,

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.000
and she's interested in ephemerality and transience.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000
And in her most recent project,

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000
it's called "Weather I Made."

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.000
And she's making weather

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.000
on her body's scale.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.000
And this piece is "Frost."

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.000
And what she did was she went out on a cold, dry night

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.000
and breathed back and forth on the lawn

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000
to leave --

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.000
to leave her life's mark,

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.000
the mark of her life.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:40.000
(Applause)

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000
And so this is five-foot, five-inches of frost

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000
that she left behind.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.000
The sun rises, and it melts away.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.000
And that was played by my mom.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.000
So the next artist, this is a group of Japanese artists,

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000
a collective of Japanese artists --

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000
(Laughter)

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.000
in Tokyo.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:01.000
And they were interested in developing a new, alternative art space,

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.000
and they needed funding for it,

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.000
so they decided to come up with some interesting fundraising projects.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.000
One of these is scratch-off masterpieces.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000
(Laughter)

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.000
And so what they're doing --

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000
each of these artists on a nine-by-seven-inch card,

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.000
which they sell for 10 bucks,

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.000
they drew original works of art.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:22.000
And you buy one, and maybe you get a real piece, and maybe not.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:25.000
Well this has sparked a craze in Japan,

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.000
because everyone's wanting a masterpiece.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000
And the ones that are the most sought after

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000
are the ones that are only barely scratched off.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:34.000
And all these works, in some way,

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:37.000
talk about luck or fate or chance.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.000
Those first two

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.000
are portraits of mega-jackpot winners years before and after their win.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:44.000
And in this one it's called "Drawing the Short Stick."

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.000
(Laughter)

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.000
I love this piece because I have a little cousin at home

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:51.000
who introduced me -- which I think is such a great introduction --

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:54.000
to a friend one day as, "This is my cousin Shea.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.000
He draws sticks real good."

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.000
(Laughter)

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:01.000
Which is one of the best compliments ever.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.000
This artist is Gus Weinmueller,

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.000
and he's doing a project, a large project, called "Art for the Peoples."

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:09.000
And within this project, he's doing a smaller project

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.000
called "Artists in Residence."

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.000
And what he does is --

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.000
(Laughter)

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.000
he spends a week at a time with a family.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:21.000
And he shows up on their porch, their doorstep,

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.000
with a toothbrush and pajamas,

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:26.000
and he's ready to spend the week with them.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000
And using only what's present,

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.000
he goes in and makes a little abode studio to work out of.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.000
And he spends that week talking to the family

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.000
about what do they think great art is.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.000
He has all these discussions with their family,

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.000
and he digs through everything they have,

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.000
and he finds materials to make work.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.000
And he makes a work

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.000
that answers what they think great art is.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.000
For this family, he made this still-life painting.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.000
And whatever he makes

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000
somehow references nesting and space

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:54.000
and personal property.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.000
This next project,

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.000
this is by Jaochim Parisvega,

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.000
and he's interested in --

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000
he believes art is everywhere waiting --

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:05.000
that it just needs a little bit of a push to happen.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:08.000
And he provides this push by harnessing natural forces,

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:12.000
like in his series where he used rain to make paintings.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.000
This project is called "Love Nests."

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:17.000
What he did was to get wild birds to make his art for him.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.000
So he put the material in places where the birds were going to collect them,

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.000
and they crafted his nests for him.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.000
And this one's called "Lovelock's Nest."

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:26.000
This one's called "Mixtape Love Song's Nest."

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:29.000
(Laughter)

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.000
And this one's called "Lovemaking Nest."

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:35.000
(Laughted)

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.000
Next is Sylvia Slater.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.000
Sylvia's interested in art training.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.000
She's a very serious Swiss artist.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.000
(Laughter)

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.000
And she was thinking about her friends and family

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:48.000
who work in chaos-ridden places and developing countries,

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.000
and she was thinking,

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.000
what can I make that would be of value to them,

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.000
in case something bad happens

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.000
and they have to buy their way across the border

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.000
or pay off a gunman?

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.000
And so she came up with creating

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.000
these pocket-sized artworks

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:05.000
that are portraits of the person that would carry them.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.000
And you would carry this around with you,

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.000
and if everything went to hell, you could make payments

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.000
and buy your life.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.000
So this life price

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:16.000
is for an irrigation non-profit director.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.000
So hopefully what happens is you never use it,

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:21.000
and it's an heirloom that you pass down.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:24.000
And she makes them so they could either be broken up into payments,

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:27.000
or they could be like these, which are leaves that can be payments.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:30.000
And so they're valuable. This is precious metals and gemstones.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.000
And this one had to get broken up.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:36.000
He had to break off a piece to get out of Egypt recently.

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:39.000
This is by a duo, Michael Abernathy and Bud Holland.

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.000
And they're interested in creating culture,

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.000
just tradition.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.000
So what they do is they move into an area

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:48.000
and try to establish a new tradition in a small geographic area.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.000
So this is in Eastern Tennessee,

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.000
and what they decided was

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:54.000
that we need a positive tradition

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.000
that goes with death.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.000
So they came up with "dig jigs."

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:01.000
And a dig jig --

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:03.000
a dig jig is where,

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:05.000
for a milestone anniversary or a birthday,

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:08.000
you gather all your friends and family together

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.000
and you dance on where you're going to be buried.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.000
(Laughter)

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:15.000
And we got a lot of attention when we did it.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.000
I talked my family into doing this, and they didn't know what I was doing.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:20.000
And I was like, "Get dressed for a funeral. We're going to go do some work."

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:23.000
And so we got to the grave and made this, which was hilarious --

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.000
the attention that we got.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.000
So what happens is you dance on the grave,

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.000
and after you've done your dance,

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.000
everyone toasts you and tells you how great you are.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:33.000
And you in essence have a funeral

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.000
that you get to be present for.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:37.000
That's my mom and dad.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.000
This is by Jason Birdsong.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:42.000
He is interested in how we see as an animal,

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:45.000
how we are interested in mimicry and camouflage.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:47.000
You know, we look down a dark alley

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.000
or a jungle path,

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.000
trying to make out a face or a creature.

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.000
We just have that natural way of seeing.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.000
And he plays with this idea.

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:57.000
And this piece: those aren't actually leaves.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.000
They're butterfly specimens who have a natural camouflage.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.000
So he pairs these up.

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.000
There's another pile of leaves.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:05.000
Those are actually all real butterfly specimens.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:08.000
And he pairs these up with paintings.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:11.000
Like this is a painting of a snake in a box.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:14.000
So you open the box and you think, "Whoa, there's a snake in there."

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.000
But it's actually a painting.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.000
So he makes these interesting conversations

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.000
about realism and mimicry

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:23.000
and our drive to be fooled by great camouflage.

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:25.000
(Laughter)

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:28.000
The next artist is Hazel Clausen.

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:31.000
Hazel Clausen is an anthropologist who took a sabbatical

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:33.000
and decided, "You know, I would learn a lot about culture

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:36.000
if I created a culture that doesn't exist from scratch."

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.000
So that's what she did.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.000
She created the Swiss people named the Uvulites,

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:43.000
and they have this distinctive yodeling song

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:45.000
that they use the uvula for.

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:47.000
And also they reference how the uvula --

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:49.000
everything they say is fallen

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:51.000
because of the forbidden fruit.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:54.000
And that's the symbol of their culture.

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.000
And this is from a documentary

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:00.000
called "Sexual Practices and Populations Control

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.000
Among the Uvulites."

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:06.000
This is a typical angora embroidery for them.

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:09.000
This is one of their founders, Gert Schaeffer.

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:11.000
(Laughter)

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:13.000
And actually this is my Aunt Irene.

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:15.000
It was so funny having a fake person

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:17.000
who was making fake things.

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:20.000
And I crack up at this piece,

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:23.000
because when I see it I know that's French angora

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:25.000
and all antique German ribbons

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:27.000
and wool that I got in a Nebraska mill

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:29.000
and carried around for 10 years

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:32.000
and then antique Chinese skirts.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.000
The next is a collective of artists

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:36.000
called the Silver Dobermans,

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.000
and their motto is to spread pragmatism

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.000
one person at a time.

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:42.000
(Laughter)

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.000
And they're really interested

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:47.000
in how over-coddled we've become.

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:51.000
So this is one of their comments on how over-coddled we've become.

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:53.000
And what they've done

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.000
is they put a warning sign on every single barb on this fence.

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:58.000
(Laughter)

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:04.000
(Applause)

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:07.000
And this is called "Horse Sense Fence."

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:09.000
The next artist is K. M. Yoon,

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:11.000
a really interesting South Korean artist.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:13.000
And he's reworking a Confucian art tradition

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:15.000
of scholar stones.

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:17.000
Next is Maynard Sipes.

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:19.000
And I love Maynard Sipes,

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:22.000
but he's off in his own world,

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:25.000
and, bless his heart, he's so paranoid.

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:29.000
Next is Roy Penig,

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:31.000
a really interesting Kentucky artist,

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:34.000
and he's the nicest guy.

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:37.000
He even once traded a work of art for a block of government cheese

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:40.000
because the person wanted it so badly.

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:44.000
Next is an Australian artist, Janeen Jackson,

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.000
and this is from a project of hers

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:49.000
called "What an Artwork Does When We're Not Watching."

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:51.000
(Laughter)

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:54.000
Next is by a Lithuanian fortune teller, Jurgi Petrauskas.

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:56.000
Next is Ginger Cheshire.

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:59.000
This is from a short film of hers called "The Last Person."

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:02.000
And that's my cousin and my sister's dog, Gabby.

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:04.000
The next, this is by Sam Sandy.

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:06.000
He's an Australian Aboriginal elder,

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:08.000
and he's also an artist.

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:10.000
And this is from a large traveling sculpture project

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:12.000
that he's doing.

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:15.000
This is from Estelle Willoughsby.

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:17.000
She heals with color.

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:20.000
And she's one of the most prolific of all these hundred artists,

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:22.000
even though she's going to be 90 next year.

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:24.000
(Laughter)

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:26.000
This is by Z. Zhou,

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:29.000
and he's interested in stasis.

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:31.000
Next is by Hilda Singh,

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:34.000
and she's doing a whole project called "Social Outfits."

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:36.000
Next is by Vera Sokolova.

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:38.000
And I have to say, Vera kind of scares me.

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:40.000
You can't look her directly in the eyes

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:42.000
because she's kind of scary.

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:44.000
And it's good that she's not real;

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:46.000
she'd be mad that I said that.

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:48.000
(Laughter)

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:51.000
And she's an optometrist in St. Petersburg,

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:53.000
and she plays with optics.

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:55.000
Next, this is by Thomas Swifton.

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:57.000
This is from a short film, "Adventures with Skinny."

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:00.000
(Laughter)

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:02.000
And this is by Cicily Bennett,

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:04.000
and it's from a series of short films.

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:07.000
And after this one, there's 77 other artists.

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:10.000
And all together with those other 77 you're not seeing,

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:12.000
that's my biennial.

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:15.000
Thank you. Thank you.

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:17.000
Thanks.

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:22.000
(Applause)
