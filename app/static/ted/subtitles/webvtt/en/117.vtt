00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
♫ Like the heather ♫

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
♫ on the hillside ♫

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
♫ as they drove us ♫

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
♫ from the Highlands ♫

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
♫ Like the ice flow ♫

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
♫ from the Arctic ♫

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
♫ where we landed ♫

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000
♫ in Newfoundland ♫

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.000
♫ There's a color ♫

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
♫ to my sorrow ♫

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
♫ There's a name for ♫

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
♫ all this sadness ♫

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
♫ Like the ocean ♫

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
♫ in between us ♫

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
♫ I am blue ♫

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
♫ Blue is a river ♫

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
♫ Blue remembered ♫

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.000
♫ Blue water ♫

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
♫ running clear ♫

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
♫ Blue like a planet ♫

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
♫ to a spaceman ♫

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.000
♫ Blue river ♫

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.000
♫ of my tears ♫

00:01:31.000 --> 00:02:04.000
(Fiddle and synthesizer)

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
♫ So I came here ♫

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.000
♫ to the city ♫

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.000
♫ where the dream burns ♫

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.000
♫ like a furnace ♫

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.000
♫ And I dazzled ♫

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
♫ in these dark streets ♫

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:31.000
♫ like a diamond ♫

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.000
♫ in a coalface ♫

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.000
♫ Then the cold wind ♫

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
♫ from the islands ♫

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.000
♫ blew a storm cloud ♫

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:51.000
♫ across the new moon ♫

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.000
♫ Like the gun smoke ♫

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000
♫ above the houses ♫

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.000
♫ in my home ♫

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.000
♫ Blue is a river ♫

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:14.000
♫ Blue remembered ♫

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.000
♫ Blue water ♫

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000
♫ running clear ♫

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.000
♫ Blue like a planet ♫

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.000
♫ to a spaceman ♫

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:34.000
♫ Blue river ♫

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.000
♫ of my tears ♫

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:42.000
♫ Blue river ♫

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000
♫ of my tears ♫

00:03:45.000 --> 00:04:46.000
(Fiddle and synthesizer)

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:53.000
(Applause)
