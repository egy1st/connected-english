00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
I'm here today

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
to start a revolution.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Now before you get up in arms,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
or you break into song,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
or you pick a favorite color,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
I want to define what I mean by revolution.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
By revolution,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
I mean a drastic and far-reaching change

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
in the way we think and behave --

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
the way we think and the way we behave.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Now why, Steve, why do we need a revolution?

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
We need a revolution

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
because things aren't working; they're just not working.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
And that makes me really sad

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
because I'm sick and tired of things not working.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
You know, I'm sick and tired of us not living up to our potential.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
I'm sick and tired of us being last.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
And we are last place in so many things --

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
for example, social factors.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
We're last place in Europe in innovation.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
There we are right at the end, right at the bottom,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
last place as a culture that doesn't value innovation.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
We're last place in health care,

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
and that's important for a sense of well-being.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
And there we are, not just last in the E.U.,

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
we're last in Europe, at the very bottom.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
And worst of all,

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
it just came out three weeks ago, many of you have seen it, The Economist.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
We're the saddest place on Earth,

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
relative to GDP per capita --

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
the saddest place on Earth.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
That's social. Let's look at education.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
Where do we rank three weeks ago

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
in another report by the OECD?

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
Last in reading, math and science. Last.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
Business:

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
The lowest perception in the E.U.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
that entrepreneurs provide benefits to society.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
Why as a result, what happens?

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
The lowest percentage of entrepreneurs starting businesses.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
And this is despite the fact

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
that everybody knows that small business

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
is the engine of economies.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
We hire the most people; we create the most taxes.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
So if our engine's broken, guess what?

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
Last in Europe GDP per capita.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
Last.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
So it's no surprise, guys, that 62 percent of Bulgarians

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
are not optimistic about the future.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
We're unhappy, we have bad education,

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000
and we have the worst businesses.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
And these are facts, guys.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
This isn't story tale; it's not make-believe.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
It's not.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
It's not a conspiracy I have got against Bulgaria. These are facts.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
So I think it should be really, really clear

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
that our system is broken.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
The way we think, the way we behave,

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
our operating system of behaving is broken.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
We need a drastic change in the way we think and behave

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
to transform Bulgaria for the better,

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
for ourselves, for our friends,

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
for our family and for our future.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
How did this happen?

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000
Let's be positive now. We're going to get positive. How did this happen?

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
I think we're last because --

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
and this is going to be drastic to some of you --

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
because we are handicapping ourselves.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
We're holding ourselves back

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
because we don't value play.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000
I said "play," all right.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.000
In case some of you forgot what play is, this is what play looks like.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
Babies play, kids play,

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
adults play.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
We don't value play.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000
In fact, we devalue play.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000
And we devalue it in three areas.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000
Let's go back to the same three areas.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
Social: 45 years of what?

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
Of communism --

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000
of valuing the society and the state over the individual

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
and squashing, inadvertently,

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.000
creativity, individual self-expression and innovation.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000
And instead, what do we value?

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
Because it's shown

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.000
the way we apply, generate and use knowledge

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
is affected by our social and institutional context,

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
which told us what in communism?

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000
To be serious.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000
To be really, really serious.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000
It did.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.000
(Applause)

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000
Be serious.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000
I can't tell you how many times I've been scolded in the park

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:51.000
for letting my kids play on the ground.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000
Heaven forbid they play in the dirt, the kal,

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
or even worse, lokvi, water -- that will kill them.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
I have been told by babas and dyados

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.000
that we shouldn't let our kids play so much

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000
because life is serious

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000
and we need to train them for the seriousness of life.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000
We have a serious meme running through.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000
It's a social gene running through us.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000
It's a serious gene.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000
It's 45 years of it

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000
that's created what I call the "baba factor."

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000
(Laughter)

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000
(Applause)

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000
And here's how it works.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.000
Step one: woman says, "I want to have a baby. Iskam baby."

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
Step two: we get the baby. Woohoo!

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
But then what happens in step three?

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
I want to go back to work

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.000
because I need to further my career or I just want to go have coffees.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.000
I'm going to give bebko to baba.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000
But we need to remember

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.000
that baba's been infected by the serious meme for 45 years.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000
So what happens?

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000
She passes that virus on to baby,

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.000
and it takes a really, really, really long time -- as the redwood trees --

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000
for that serious meme

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000
to get out of our operating system.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000
What happens then?

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.000
It goes into education where we have an antiquated education system

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000
that has little changed for 100 years,

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000
that values rote learning,

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000
memorization and standardization,

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.000
and devalues self-expression, self-exploration,

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000
questioning, creativity and play.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000
It's a crap system.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:19.000
True story: I went looking for a school for my kid.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000
We went to this prestigious little school

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000
and they say they're going to study math 10 times a week

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000
and science eight times a week

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000
and reading five times a day and all this stuff.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000
And we said, "Well what about play and recess?"

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000
And they said, "Ha. There won't be a single moment in the schedule."

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.000
(Laughter)

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000
And we said, "He's five."

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000
What a crime. What a crime.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000
And it's a crime

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.000
that our education system is so serious because education is serious

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000
that we're creating mindless, robotic workers

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.000
to put bolts in pre-drilled holes.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000
But I'm sorry, the problems of today

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000
are not the problems of the Industrial Revolution.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.000
We need adaptability,

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.000
the ability to learn how to be creative and innovative.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.000
We don't need mechanized workers.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.000
But no, now our meme goes into work where we don't value play.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.000
We create robotic workers that we treat like assets,

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000
to lever and just throw away.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.000
What are qualities of a Bulgarian work?

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000
Autocratic --

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000
do what I say because I'm the chef.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.000
I'm the boss and I know better than you.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.000
Untrusting -- you're obviously a criminal, so I'm going to install cameras.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.000
(Laughter)

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.000
Controlling --

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.000
you're obviously an idiot, so I'm going to make

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:28.000
a zillion little processes for you to follow so you don't step out of the box.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000
So they're restrictive -- don't use your mobile phone,

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000
don't use your laptop, don't search the Internet,

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000
don't be on I.M.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000
That's somehow unprofessional and bad.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.000
And at the end of the day, it's unfulfilling

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.000
because you're controlled, you're restricted, you're not valued

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.000
and you're not having any fun.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.000
In social, in education and in our business,

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000
don't value play.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000
And that's why we're last,

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000
because we don't value play.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.000
And you can say, "That's ridiculous, Steve. What a dumb idea.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000
It can't be because of play.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.000
Just play, that's a stupid thing."

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000
We have the serious meme in us.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000
Well I'm going to say no.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.000
And I will prove it to you in the next part of the speech --

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:08.000
that play is the catalyst, it is the revolution,

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:11.000
that we can use to transform Bulgaria for the better.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.000
Play:

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000
our brains

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.000
are hardwired for play.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.000
Evolution has selected,

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:22.000
over millions and billions of years,

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:25.000
for play in animals and in humans.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.000
And you know what?

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000
Evolution does a really, really good job

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:32.000
of deselecting traits that aren't advantageous to us

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.000
and selecting traits for competitive advantage.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.000
Nature isn't stupid, and it selected for play.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.000
Throughout the animal kingdom, for example:

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.000
ants. Ants play.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.000
Maybe you didn't know that.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.000
But when they're playing,

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.000
they're learning the social order and dynamics of things.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.000
Rats play, but what you might not have known

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000
is that rats that play more

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000
have bigger brains

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.000
and they learn tasks better,

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.000
skills.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000
Kittens play. We all know kittens play.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000
But what you may not know

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:05.000
is that kittens deprived of play

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.000
are unable to interact socially.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:10.000
They can still hunt, but they can't be social.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000
Bears play.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.000
But what you may not know

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:17.000
is that bears that play more survive longer.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.000
It's not the bears that learn how to fish better.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:22.000
It's the ones that play more.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.000
And a final really interesting study --

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000
it's been shown, a correlation

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000
between play and brain size.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.000
The more you play, the bigger the brains there are.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:34.000
Dolphins, pretty big brains, play a lot.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.000
But who do you think

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.000
with the biggest brains are the biggest players?

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.000
Yours truly: humans.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.000
Kids play, we play --

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.000
of every nationality, of every race,

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.000
of every color, of every religion.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.000
It's a universal thing -- we play.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:52.000
And it's not just kids, it's adults too.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.000
Really cool term: neoteny --

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:57.000
the retention of play and juvenile traits in adults.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.000
And who are the biggest neotenists?

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.000
Humans. We play sports.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.000
We do it for fun, or as Olympians, or as professionals.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.000
We play musical instruments.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.000
We dance, we kiss, we sing,

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.000
we just goof around.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.000
We're designed by nature to play

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.000
from birth to old age.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:18.000
We're designed to do that continuously --

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.000
to play and play a lot

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.000
and not stop playing.

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:25.000
It is a huge benefit.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.000
Just like there's benefits to animals,

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.000
there's benefits to humans.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.000
For example, it's been shown

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.000
to stimulate neural growth in the amygdala,

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.000
in the area where it controls emotions.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:38.000
It's been shown to promote pre-frontal cortex development

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.000
where a lot of cognition is happening.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.000
As a result, what happens?

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.000
We develop more emotional maturity if we play more.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.000
We develop better decision-making ability

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.000
if we play more.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.000
These guys are facts.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.000
It's not fiction, it's not story tales, it's not make-believe;

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.000
it's cold, hard science.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:58.000
These are the benefits to play.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:01.000
It is a genetic birthright that we have,

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:04.000
like walking or speaking or seeing.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.000
And if we handicap ourselves with play,

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.000
we handicap ourselves

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.000
as if we would with any other birthright that we have.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:13.000
We hold ourselves back.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.000
Little exercise just for a second:

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.000
close your eyes

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:21.000
and try to imagine a world without play.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:24.000
Imagine a world without theater, without the arts,

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:27.000
without song, without dancing,

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.000
without soccer, without football,

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.000
without laughter.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:33.000
What does this world look like?

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.000
It's pretty bleak.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.000
It's pretty glum.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.000
Now imagine your workplace.

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.000
Is it fun? Is it playful?

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:44.000
Or maybe the workplace of your friends -- here we're forward thinking.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.000
Is it fun? Is it playful?

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:49.000
Or is it crap? Is it autocratic, controlling,

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:52.000
restrictive and untrusting and unfulfilling?

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.000
We have this concept

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:59.000
that the opposite of play is work.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:02.000
We even feel guilty if we're seen playing at work.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:05.000
"Oh, my colleagues see me laughing. I must not have enough work,"

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:08.000
or, "Oh, I've got to hide because my boss might see me.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:11.000
He's going to think I'm not working hard."

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.000
But I have news for you: our thinking is backwards.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.000
The opposite of play

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.000
is not work.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.000
The opposite of play

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:22.000
is depression. It's depression.

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.000
In fact,

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.000
play improves our work.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.000
Just like there's benefits for humans and animals,

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.000
there's benefits for play at work.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:34.000
For example, it stimulates creativity.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:37.000
It increases our openness to change.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.000
It improves our ability to learn.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.000
It provides a sense of purpose and mastery --

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:43.000
two key motivational things

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.000
that increase productivity,

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:47.000
through play.

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:50.000
So before you start thinking of play as just not serious,

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.000
play doesn't mean frivolous.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.000
You know, the professional athlete that loves skiing,

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:57.000
he's serious about it, but he loves it.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:00.000
He's having fun, he's in the groove, he's in the flow.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.000
A doctor might be serious,

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:05.000
but laughter's still a great medicine.

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.000
Our thinking is backwards.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.000
We shouldn't be feeling guilty.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.000
We should be celebrating play.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.000
Quick example from the corporate world.

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:17.000
FedEx, easy motto: people, service, profit.

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:20.000
If you treat your people like people, if you treat them great,

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:23.000
they're happier, they're fulfilled, they have a sense of mastery and purpose.

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:25.000
What happens? They give better service --

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.000
not worse, but better.

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:29.000
And when customers call for service

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:32.000
and they're dealing with happy people that can make decisions and are fulfilled,

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.000
how do the customers feel? They feel great.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:37.000
And what do great customers do, great-feeling customers?

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.000
They buy more of your service and they tell more of their friends,

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:41.000
which leads to more profit.

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.000
People, service, profit.

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:46.000
Play increases productivity, not decreases.

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.000
And you're going to say,

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.000
"Gee, that can work for FedEx out there in the United States,

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:52.000
but it can't work in Bulgaria.

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.000
No way. We're different."

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.000
It does work in Bulgaria, you guys. Two reasons.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.000
One, play is universal.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:01.000
There's nothing weird about Bulgarians that we can't play,

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:03.000
besides the serious meme that we have to kick out.

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:06.000
Two, I've tried it. I've tried at Sciant.

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.000
When I got there, we had zero happy customers.

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:10.000
Not one customer would refer us.

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.000
I asked them all.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.000
We had marginal profit -- I did.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.000
We had marginal profits,

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.000
and we had unhappy stakeholders.

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:20.000
Through some basic change,

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:23.000
change like improving transparency,

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:25.000
change like promoting self-direction

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:28.000
and collaboration, encouraging collaboration,

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.000
not autocracy,

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.000
the things like having a results-focus.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:35.000
I don't care when you get in in the morning. I don't care when you leave.

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:37.000
I care that your customer and your team is happy

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:39.000
and you're organized with that.

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:41.000
Why do I care if you get in at nine o'clock?

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:43.000
Basically promoting fun.

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:46.000
Through promoting fun and a great environment,

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.000
we were able to transform Sciant

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.000
and, in just three short years --

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.000
sounds like a long time, but change is slow --

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:55.000
every customer, from zero to every customer referring us,

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.000
above average profits for the industry

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:59.000
and happy stakeholders.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:01.000
And you can say, "Well how do you know they're happy?"

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:03.000
Well we did win, every year that we entered,

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:06.000
one of the rankings for best employer for small business.

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:08.000
Independent analysis from anonymous employees

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:10.000
on their surveys.

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:12.000
It does, and it can, work in Bulgaria.

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:14.000
There's nothing holding us back,

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:17.000
except our own mentality about play.

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:20.000
So some steps that we can take -- to finish up --

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:22.000
how to make this revolution through play.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:24.000
First of all, you have to believe me.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.000
If you don't believe me,

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.000
well just go home and think about it some more or something.

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:31.000
Second of all, if you don't have the feeling of play in you,

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:33.000
you need to rediscover play.

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:35.000
Whatever it was that as a kid you used to enjoy,

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:37.000
that you enjoyed only six months ago,

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.000
but now that you've got that promotion you can't enjoy,

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:41.000
because you feel like you have to be serious,

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:43.000
rediscover it.

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:45.000
I don't care if it's mountain biking or reading a book or playing a game.

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:47.000
Rediscover that

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:49.000
because you're the leaders,

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:51.000
the innovation leaders, the thought leaders.

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:53.000
You're the ones that have to go back to the office

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:55.000
or talk to your friends

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:58.000
and ignite the fire of change in the play revolution.

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:00.000
You guys have to, and if you're not feeling it,

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:03.000
your colleagues, your employees, aren't going to feel it.

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:06.000
You've got to go back and say, "Hey, I'm going to trust you."

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:09.000
Weird concept: I hired you; I should trust you.

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:12.000
I'm going to let you make decisions. I'm going to empower you,

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:15.000
and I'm going to delegate to the lowest level, rather than the top.

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:18.000
I'm going to encourage constructive criticism.

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.000
I'm going to let you challenge authority.

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:23.000
Because it's by challenging the way things are always done

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:25.000
is that we are able to break out of the rut that we're in

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:27.000
and create innovative solutions

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:29.000
to problems of today.

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:31.000
We're not always right as leaders.

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:33.000
We're going to eradicate fear.

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:36.000
Fear is the enemy of play.

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:38.000
And we're going to do things

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:40.000
like eliminate restrictions.

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:42.000
You know what, let them use their mobile phone

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:45.000
for personal calls -- heaven forbid.

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:47.000
Let them be on the Internet.

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:50.000
Let them be on instant messengers.

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:54.000
Let them take long lunches.

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:56.000
Lunch is like the recess for work.

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:58.000
It's when you go out in the world

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:00.000
and you recharge your brain, you meet your friends,

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:03.000
you have a beer, you have some food, you talk,

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:05.000
you get some synergy of ideas

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:07.000
that maybe you wouldn't have had before.

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:10.000
Let them do it. Give them some freedom,

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:13.000
and in general, let them play. Let them have fun at the workplace.

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:16.000
We spend so much of our lives at the workplace,

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:18.000
and it's supposed to be, what, a miserable grind,

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:21.000
so that 20 years from now, we wake up and say, "Is this it?

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:23.000
Is that all there was?"

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:25.000
Unacceptable. Nepriemliv.

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:27.000
(Laughter)

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:30.000
So in summary,

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:32.000
we need a drastic change

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:34.000
in the way we think and behave,

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:36.000
but we don't need

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:39.000
a workers' revolution.

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:41.000
We don't need a workers' revolution.

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:43.000
What we need

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:45.000
is a players' uprising.

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:48.000
What we need is a players' uprising.

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:50.000
What we need is a players' uprising.

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:52.000
Seriously, we need to band together.

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:54.000
Today is the start of the uprising.

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:56.000
But what you need to do

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:58.000
is fan the flames of the revolution.

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:01.000
You need to go and share your ideas and your success stories

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:03.000
of what worked

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:06.000
about reinvigorating our lives, our schools,

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:08.000
and our work with play;

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:10.000
about how play promotes

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:13.000
a sense of promise and self-fulfillment;

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:17.000
of how play promotes innovation and productivity,

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:20.000
and, ultimately, how play creates meaning.

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:24.000
Because we can't do it alone. We have to do it together,

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:27.000
and together, if we do this and share these ideas on play,

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:31.000
we can transform Bulgaria for the better.

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:33.000
Thank you.

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:36.000
(Applause)
