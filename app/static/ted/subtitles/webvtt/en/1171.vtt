00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
As an artist,

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
connection is very important to me.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Through my work I'm trying to articulate

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
that humans are not separate from nature

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
and that everything is interconnected.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
I first went to Antarctica almost 10 years ago,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
where I saw my first icebergs.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
I was in awe.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
My heart beat fast, my head was dizzy,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
trying to comprehend what it was that stood in front of me.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
The icebergs around me

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
were almost 200 feet out of the water,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
and I could only help but wonder

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
that this was one snowflake

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
on top of another snowflake,

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
year after year.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Icebergs are born

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
when they calve off of glaciers

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
or break off of ice shelves.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Each iceberg has its own individual personality.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
They have a distinct way

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
of interacting with their environment

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
and their experiences.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
Some refuse to give up

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
and hold on to the bitter end,

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
while others can't take it anymore

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000
and crumble in a fit of dramatic passion.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
It's easy to think, when you look at an iceberg,

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
that they're isolated,

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
that they're separate and alone,

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
much like we as humans sometimes view ourselves.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
But the reality is far from it.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
As an iceberg melts,

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
I am breathing in

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
its ancient atmosphere.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
As the iceberg melts,

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.000
it is releasing mineral-rich fresh water

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
that nourishes many forms of life.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
I approach photographing these icebergs

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
as if I'm making portraits of my ancestors,

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
knowing that in these individual moments

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
they exist in that way

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
and will never exist that way again.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
It is not a death when they melt;

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
it is not an end,

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
but a continuation

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
of their path through the cycle of life.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.000
Some of the ice in the icebergs that I photograph is very young --

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
a couple thousand years old.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
And some of the ice

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000
is over 100,000 years old.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
The last pictures I'd like to show you

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
are of an iceberg that I photographed

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
in Qeqetarsuaq, Greenland.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
It's a very rare occasion

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
that you get to actually witness

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
an iceberg rolling.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
So here it is.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000
You can see on the left side a small boat.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000
That's about a 15-foot boat.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
And I'd like you to pay attention

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
to the shape of the iceberg

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
and where it is at the waterline.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
You can see here, it begins to roll,

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
and the boat has moved to the other side, and the man is standing there.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000
This is an average-size Greenlandic iceberg.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000
It's about 120 feet above the water,

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
or 40 meters.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
And this video is real time.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:16.000
(Music)

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000
And just like that,

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000
the iceberg shows you a different side of its personality.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000
Thank you.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:49.000
(Applause)
