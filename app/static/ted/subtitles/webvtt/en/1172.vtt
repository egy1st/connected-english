00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:13.000
(Music)

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Text: BeatJazz.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
BeatJazz is:

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
1. Live looping,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
2. Jazz improvisation

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
And

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
3. "Gestural" sound design.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
Accelerometers

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
on each hand

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
read hand position.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.000
The color of the lights

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000
indicates which sound I am playing.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.000
Red = Drums,

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.000
Blue = Bass,

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:07.000
Green = Chords,

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
Orange = Leads,

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.000
Purple = Pads

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.000
The mouthpiece

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
consists of ...

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
a button,

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.000
two guitar picks

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.000
and lots of hot glue.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.000
The heads-up display

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.000
is a smartphone that displays system parameters.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.000
Why?

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000
To atomize music culture

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000
so that ALL past, present and future genres

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.000
can be studied and abstracted, live.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000
And

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.000
"BeatJazzers"

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:02.000
become as common as D.J.'s.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:11.000
But mostly ...

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:16.000
to MAKE the future

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.000
rather than wait for it.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:08.000
(Applause)
