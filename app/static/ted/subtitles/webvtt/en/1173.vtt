00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:27.000
(Music)

00:06:49.000 --> 00:07:11.000
(Applause)

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.000
Thank you.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.000
Imagining a solo cello concert,

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.000
one would most likely think of Johann Sebastian Bach

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:23.000
unaccompanied cello suites.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.000
As a child

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:28.000
studying these eternal masterpieces,

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000
Bach's music would intermingle

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.000
with the singing voices of Muslim prayers

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.000
from the neighboring Arab village

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.000
of the northern Kibbutz in Israel

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.000
where I grew up.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.000
Late at night, after hours of practicing,

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:44.000
I would listen to Janis Joplin and Billie Holiday

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.000
as the sounds of tango music

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:49.000
would be creeping from my parents' stereo.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:52.000
It all became music to me.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:55.000
I didn't hear the boundaries.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.000
I still start every day

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.000
practicing playing Bach.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.000
His music never ceases

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.000
to sound fresh and surprising to me.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.000
But as I was moving away

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.000
from the traditional classical repertoire

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.000
and trying to find new ways

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.000
of musical expression,

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:14.000
I realized that with today's technological resources,

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.000
there's no reason to limit

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:19.000
what can be produced at one time

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.000
from a single string instrument.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.000
The power and coherency

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:27.000
that comes from one person hearing, perceiving and playing all the voices

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:30.000
makes a very different experience.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.000
The excitement of a great orchestra performance

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.000
comes from the attempt to have a collective of musicians

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.000
producing one unified whole concept.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.000
The excitement from using multi-tracking,

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:46.000
the way I did in the piece you will hear next,

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.000
comes from the attempt

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.000
to build and create a whole universe

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:54.000
with many diverse layers,

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:57.000
all generated from a single source.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.000
My cello and my voice are layered

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:02.000
to create this large sonic canvas.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:05.000
When composers write music for me,

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.000
I ask them to forget what they know about the cello.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:10.000
I hope to arrive at new territories

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:13.000
to discover sounds I have never heard before.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.000
I want to create endless possibilities

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.000
with this cello.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:20.000
I become the medium through which the music is being channeled,

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:23.000
and in the process, when all is right,

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.000
the music is transformed

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.000
and so am I.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:44.000
(Music)

00:19:44.000 --> 00:20:08.000
(Applause)
