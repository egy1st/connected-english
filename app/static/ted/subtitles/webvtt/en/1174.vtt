00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
By birth and by choice,

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
I've been involved with the auto industry my entire life,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
and for the past 30 years,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
I've worked at Ford Motor Company.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
And for most of those years,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
I worried about,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
how am I going to sell more cars and trucks?

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
But today I worry about,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
what if all we do is sell more cars and trucks?

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
What happens

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
when the number of vehicles on the road doubles, triples,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
or even quadruples?

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
My life is guided by two great passions,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
and the first is automobiles.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
I literally grew up with the Ford Motor Company.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
I thought it was so cool as a little boy

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
when my dad would bring home the latest Ford or Lincoln

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
and leave it in the driveway.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
And I decided about that time, about age 10,

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
that it would be really cool if I was a test driver.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
So my parents would go to dinner.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
They'd sit down; I'd sneak out of the house.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
I'd jump behind the wheel and take the new model around the driveway,

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
and it was a blast.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
And that went on for about two years,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
until -- I think I was about 12 --

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
my dad brought home

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
a Lincoln Mark III.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
And it was snowing that day.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
So he and mom went to dinner,

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
and I snuck out

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
and thought it'd be really cool to do donuts

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
or even some figure-eights in the snow.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
My dad finished dinner early that evening.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
And he was walking to the front hall

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
and out the front door

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
just about the same time I hit some ice

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
and met him at the front door with the car --

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
and almost ended up in the front hall.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
So it kind of cooled my test-driving for a little while.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
But I really began to love cars then.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.000
And my first car was a 1975 electric-green Mustang.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
And even though the color was pretty hideous,

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
I did love the car,

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
and it really cemented my love affair with cars

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
that's continued on to this day.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
But cars are really more than a passion of mine;

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
they're quite literally in my blood.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
My great grandfather was Henry Ford,

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
and on my mother's side,

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
my great grandfather was Harvey Firestone.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
So when I was born,

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.000
I guess you could say expectations were kind of high for me.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
But my great grandfather, Henry Ford,

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
really believed that the mission of the Ford Motor Company

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
was to make people's lives better

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000
and make cars affordable so that everyone could have them.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000
Because he believed that with mobility

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
comes freedom and progress.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
And that's a belief that I share.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
My other great passion is the environment.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
And as a young boy, I used to go up to Northern Michigan

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
and fish in the rivers that Hemingway fished in

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
and then later wrote about.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
And it really struck me

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000
as the years went by,

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
in a very negative way,

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
when I would go to some stream that I'd loved,

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
and was used to walking through this field

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
that was once filled with fireflies,

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
and now had a strip mall or a bunch of condos on it.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
And so even at a young age,

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
that really resonated with me,

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000
and the whole notion of environmental preservation,

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000
at a very basic level, sunk in with me.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000
As a high-schooler, I started to read

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000
authors like Thoreau and Aldo Leopold

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
and Edward Abbey,

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
and I really began to develop

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000
a deeper appreciation of the natural world.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
But it never really occurred to me

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.000
that my love of cars and trucks

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000
would ever be in conflict with nature.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
And that was true

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
until I got to college.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.000
And when I got to college, you can imagine my surprise

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
when I would go to class

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.000
and a number of my professors would say

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000
that Ford Motor Company and my family

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.000
was everything that was wrong with our country.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.000
They thought that we were more interested, as an industry,

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000
in profits, rather than progress,

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:49.000
and that we filled the skies with smog --

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000
and frankly, we were the enemy.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000
I joined Ford after college,

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000
after some soul searching

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.000
whether or not this is really the right thing to do.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000
But I decided that I wanted to go

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
and see if I could affect change there.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.000
And as I look back over 30 years ago,

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000
it was a little naive to think at that age

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000
that I could. But I wanted to.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000
And I really discovered

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000
that my professors weren't completely wrong.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000
In fact, when I got back to Detroit,

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000
my environmental leanings weren't exactly embraced

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000
by those in my own company,

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000
and certainly by those in the industry.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000
I had some very interesting conversations,

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000
as you can imagine.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
There were some within Ford

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000
who believed that all this ecological nonsense

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000
should just disappear

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000
and that I needed to stop hanging out

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.000
with "environmental wackos."

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000
I was considered a radical.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.000
And I'll never forget the day I was called in by a member of top management

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000
and told to stop associating

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000
with any known or suspected environmentalists.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.000
(Laughter)

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.000
Of course, I had no intention of doing that,

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000
and I kept speaking out about the environment,

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000
and it really was the topic

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000
that we now today call sustainability.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.000
And in time, my views went from controversial

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000
to more or less consensus today.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000
I mean, I think most people in the industry

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000
understand that we've got to get on with it.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.000
And the good news is today we are tackling the big issues,

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000
of cars and the environment --

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000
not only at Ford, but really as an industry.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.000
We're pushing fuel efficiency to new heights.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000
And with new technology,

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.000
we're reducing -- and I believe, someday we'll eliminate --

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000
CO2 emissions.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.000
We're starting to sell electric cars, which is great.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.000
We're developing alternative powertrains

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.000
that are going to make cars affordable

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.000
in every sense of the word --

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000
economically, socially

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000
and environmentally.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.000
And actually, although we've got a long way to go

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000
and a lot of work to do,

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.000
I can see the day where my two great passions --

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000
cars and the environment --

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000
actually come into harmony.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.000
But unfortunately,

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000
as we're on our way to solving one monstrous problem --

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.000
and as I said, we're not there yet; we've got a lot of work to do,

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000
but I can see where we will --

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.000
but even as we're in the process of doing that,

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000
another huge problem is looming,

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.000
and people aren't noticing.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000
And that is the freedom of mobility

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000
that my great grandfather brought to people

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.000
is now being threatened, just as the environment is.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.000
The problem, put in its simplest terms,

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000
is one of mathematics.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:26.000
Today there are approximately 6.8 billion people in the world,

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000
and within our lifetime, that number's going to grow

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000
to about nine billion.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000
And at that population level,

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.000
our planet will be dealing with the limits of growth.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.000
And with that growth

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:40.000
comes some severe practical problems,

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:43.000
one of which is our transportation system

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:46.000
simply won't be able to deal with it.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.000
When we look at the population growth in terms of cars,

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.000
it becomes even clearer.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.000
Today there are about 800 million cars on the road worldwide.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000
But with more people

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.000
and greater prosperity around the world,

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.000
that number's going to grow

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.000
to between two and four billion cars by mid century.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.000
And this is going to create the kind of global gridlock

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:08.000
that the world has never seen before.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.000
Now think about the impact

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.000
that this is going to have on our daily lives.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.000
Today the average American

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.000
spends about a week a year

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.000
stuck in traffic jams,

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.000
and that's a huge waste of time and resources.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.000
But that's nothing compared

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.000
to what's going on

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.000
in the nations that are growing the fastest.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000
Today the average driver in Beijing

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:32.000
has a five-hour commute.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.000
And last summer -- many of you probably saw this --

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.000
there was a hundred-mile traffic jam

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:41.000
that took 11 days to clear in China.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.000
In the decades to come,

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.000
75 percent of the world's population

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.000
will live in cities,

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.000
and 50 of those cities

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:52.000
will be of 10 million people or more.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:55.000
So you can see the size of the issue that we're facing.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:58.000
When you factor in population growth,

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:01.000
it's clear that the mobility model that we have today

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.000
simply will not work tomorrow.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.000
Frankly, four billion clean cars on the road

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.000
are still four billion cars,

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:11.000
and a traffic jam with no emissions

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:14.000
is still a traffic jam.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:17.000
So, if we make no changes today,

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.000
what does tomorrow look like?

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:22.000
Well I think you probably already have the picture.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.000
Traffic jams are just a symptom of this challenge,

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000
and they're really very, very inconvenient,

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000
but that's all they are.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.000
But the bigger issue

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000
is that global gridlock

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.000
is going to stifle economic growth

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.000
and our ability to deliver

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.000
food and health care,

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:41.000
particularly to people that live in city centers.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:45.000
And our quality of life is going to be severely compromised.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.000
So what's going to solve this?

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:50.000
Well the answer isn't going to be more of the same.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:53.000
My great grandfather once said

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.000
before he invented the Model T,

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.000
"If I had asked people then what they wanted,

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.000
they would have answered,

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.000
'We want faster horses.'"

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.000
So the answer to more cars

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:06.000
is simply not to have more roads.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.000
When America began moving west,

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.000
we didn't add more wagon trains,

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.000
we built railroads.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.000
And to connect our country after World War II,

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:17.000
we didn't build more two-lane highways,

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.000
we built the interstate highway system.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:22.000
Today we need that same leap in thinking

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:25.000
for us to create a viable future.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.000
We are going to build smart cars,

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.000
but we also need to build

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.000
smart roads, smart parking,

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:34.000
smart public transportation systems and more.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.000
We don't want to waste our time

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.000
sitting in traffic, sitting at tollbooths

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:41.000
or looking for parking spots.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.000
We need an integrated system

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.000
that uses real time data

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:48.000
to optimize personal mobility on a massive scale

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:51.000
without hassle or compromises for travelers.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.000
And frankly, that's the kind of system

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:57.000
that's going to make the future of personal mobility sustainable.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:00.000
Now the good news is some of this work has already begun

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.000
in different parts of the world.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:05.000
The city of Masdar in Abu Dhabi

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.000
uses driverless electric vehicles

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.000
that can communicate with one another,

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:12.000
and they go underneath the city streets.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:15.000
And up above, you've got a series of pedestrian walkways.

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:17.000
On New York City's 34th Street,

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.000
gridlock will soon be replaced

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.000
with a connected system

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:24.000
of vehicle-specific corridors.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:27.000
Pedestrian zones and dedicated traffic lanes are going to be created,

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:30.000
and all of this will cut down the average rush hour commute

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.000
to get across town in New York

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.000
from about an hour today at rush hour

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.000
to about 20 minutes.

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.000
Now if you look at Hong Kong,

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:41.000
they have a very interesting system called Octopus there.

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.000
It's a system that really ties together

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.000
all the transportation assets

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.000
into a single payment system.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:50.000
So parking garages, buses, trains,

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:53.000
they all operate within the same system.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.000
Now shared car services

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.000
are also springing up around the world,

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.000
and these efforts, I think, are great.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.000
They're relieving congestion,

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:03.000
and they're frankly starting to save some fuel.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:05.000
These are all really good ideas

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:07.000
that will move us forward.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.000
But what really inspires me

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.000
is what's going to be possible

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.000
when our cars can begin talking to each other.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:16.000
Very soon, the same systems that we use today

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.000
to bring music and entertainment

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:21.000
and GPS information into our vehicles

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.000
are going to be used to create

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.000
a smart vehicle network.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.000
Every morning I drive about 30 miles

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:30.000
from my home in Ann Arbor to my office in Dearborn, Michigan.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.000
And every night I go home,

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.000
my commute is a total crapshoot.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.000
And I often have to leave the freeway

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.000
and look for different ways

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.000
for me to try and make it home.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:42.000
But very soon we're going to see the days

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:45.000
when cars are essentially talking to each other.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:48.000
So if the car ahead of me on I-94 hits traffic,

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:51.000
it will immediately alert my car

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.000
and tell my car to reroute itself

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:56.000
to get me home in the best possible way.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.000
And these systems are being tested right now,

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:02.000
and frankly they're going to be ready for prime time pretty soon.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:05.000
But the potential of a connected car network

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:07.000
is almost limitless.

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:09.000
So just imagine:

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:11.000
one day very soon,

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.000
you're going to be able to plan a trip downtown

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:16.000
and your car will be connected to a smart parking system.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.000
So you get in your car,

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.000
and as you get in your car,

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:23.000
your car will reserve you a parking spot before you arrive --

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:25.000
no more driving around looking for one,

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:28.000
which frankly is one of the biggest users of fuel

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.000
in today's cars in urban areas --

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.000
is looking for parking spots.

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.000
Or think about being in New York City

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:37.000
and tracking down an intelligent cab on your smart phone

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:41.000
so you don't have to wait in the cold to hail one.

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.000
Or being at a future TED Conference

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:45.000
and having your car

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:47.000
talk to the calendars of everybody here

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:49.000
and telling you all the best route to take home

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:51.000
and when you should leave

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:54.000
so that you can all arrive at your next destination on time.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.000
This is the kind of technology

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:59.000
that will merge millions of individual vehicles

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.000
into a single system.

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:04.000
So I think it's clear we have the beginnings of a solution

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:07.000
to this enormous problem.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:10.000
But as we found out with addressing CO2 issues,

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.000
and also fossil fuels,

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.000
there is no one silver bullet.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.000
The solution is not going to be

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:19.000
more cars, more roads or a new rail system;

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:21.000
it can only be found, I believe,

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.000
in a global network

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:25.000
of interconnected solutions.

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:27.000
Now I know we can develop the technology

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:29.000
that's going to make this work,

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:31.000
but we've got to be willing to get out there

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.000
and seek out the solutions --

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:36.000
whether that means vehicle sharing or public transportation

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:39.000
or some other way we haven't even thought of yet;

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:42.000
our overall transportation-mix and infrastructure

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:45.000
must support all the future options.

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.000
We need our best and our brightest

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:49.000
to start entertaining this issue.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:52.000
Companies, entrepreneurs, venture capitalists,

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:54.000
they all need to understand

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.000
this is a huge business opportunity,

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:58.000
as well as an enormous social problem.

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:00.000
And just as these groups

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:03.000
embrace the green energy challenge --

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:05.000
and it's really been amazing to me to watch

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:08.000
how much brain power, how much money

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:10.000
and how much serious thought

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:12.000
has, really over the last three years,

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:14.000
just poured into the green energy field.

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:17.000
We need that same kind of passion and energy

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:19.000
to attack global gridlock.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:21.000
But we need people like all of you in this room,

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:23.000
leading thinkers.

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:25.000
I mean, frankly, I need all of you

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:27.000
to think about how

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:29.000
you can help solve this huge issue.

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:31.000
And we need people from all walks of life;

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:33.000
not just inventors, we need policymakers

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:35.000
and government officials

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:38.000
to also think about how they're going to respond to this challenge.

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:40.000
This isn't going to be solved

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.000
by any one person or one group.

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:45.000
It's going to really require a national energy policy,

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:47.000
frankly for each country,

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:50.000
because the solutions in each country are going to be different

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:53.000
based upon income levels, traffic jams

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:55.000
and also how integrated

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:57.000
the systems already are.

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:00.000
But we need to get going, and we need to get going today.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.000
And we must have an infrastructure

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:04.000
that's designed to support

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:06.000
this flexible future.

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:08.000
You know, we've come a long way.

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:10.000
Since the Model T,

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:12.000
most people never traveled

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:15.000
more than 25 miles from home in their entire lifetime.

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:17.000
And since then,

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:19.000
the automobile has allowed us the freedom

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:21.000
to choose where we live, where we work,

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:23.000
where we play

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:26.000
and frankly when we just go out and want to move around.

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:29.000
We don't want to regress and lose that freedom.

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:31.000
We're on our way to solving --

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:33.000
and as I said earlier, I know we've got a long way to go --

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:36.000
the one big issue that we're all focused on that threatens it,

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:38.000
and that's the environmental issue,

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:40.000
but I believe we all must turn

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:44.000
all of our effort and all of our ingenuity and determination

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:47.000
to help now solve this notion of global gridlock.

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:49.000
Because in doing so,

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:52.000
we're going to preserve what we've really come to take for granted,

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:54.000
which is the freedom to move

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:57.000
and move very effortlessly around the world.

00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:59.000
And it frankly will enhance our quality of life

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:01.000
if we fix this.

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:04.000
Because, if you can envision, as I do,

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:06.000
a future of zero emissions

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:09.000
and freedom to move around the country and around the world

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:11.000
like we take for granted today,

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:13.000
that's worth the hard work today

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:15.000
to preserve that for tomorrow.

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:17.000
I believe we're at our best

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:19.000
when we're confronted with big issues.

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:21.000
This is a big one, and it won't wait.

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:23.000
So let's get started now.

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:25.000
Thank you.

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:28.000
(Applause)
