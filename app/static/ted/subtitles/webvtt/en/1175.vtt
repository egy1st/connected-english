WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
I'm a savant,

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
or more precisely,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
a high-functioning

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
autistic savant.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
It's a rare condition.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
And rarer still when accompanied,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
as in my case,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
by self-awareness

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
and a mastery of language.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Very often when I meet someone

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
and they learn this about me,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
there's a certain kind of awkwardness.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
I can see it in their eyes.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
They want to ask me something.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
And in the end, quite often,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
the urge is stronger than they are

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
and they blurt it out:

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
"If I give you my date of birth,

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
can you tell me what day of the week I was born on?"

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
(Laughter)

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
Or they mention cube roots

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000
or ask me to recite a long number or long text.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
I hope you'll forgive me

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
if I don't perform

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
a kind of one-man savant show for you today.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
I'm going to talk instead

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
about something

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
far more interesting

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
than dates of birth or cube roots --

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
a little deeper

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
and a lot closer, to my mind, than work.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
I want to talk to you briefly

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
about perception.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
When he was writing the plays and the short stories

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
that would make his name,

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
Anton Chekhov kept a notebook

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
in which he noted down

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
his observations

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
of the world around him --

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
little details

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
that other people seem to miss.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
Every time I read Chekhov

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.000
and his unique vision of human life,

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
I'm reminded of why I too

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
became a writer.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
In my books,

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
I explore the nature of perception

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
and how different kinds of perceiving

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
create different kinds of knowing

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
and understanding.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
Here are three questions

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
drawn from my work.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
Rather than try to figure them out,

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000
I'm going to ask you to consider for a moment

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
the intuitions

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
and the gut instincts

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
that are going through your head and your heart

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
as you look at them.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
For example, the calculation:

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
can you feel where on the number line

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000
the solution is likely to fall?

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000
Or look at the foreign word and the sounds:

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
can you get a sense of the range of meanings

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
that it's pointing you towards?

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
And in terms of the line of poetry,

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
why does the poet use the word hare

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000
rather than rabbit?

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
I'm asking you to do this

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.000
because I believe our personal perceptions, you see,

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
are at the heart

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
of how we acquire knowledge.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000
Aesthetic judgments,

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000
rather than abstract reasoning,

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
guide and shape the process

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000
by which we all come to know

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000
what we know.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000
I'm an extreme example of this.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000
My worlds of words and numbers

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
blur with color, emotion

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000
and personality.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000
As Juan said,

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.000
it's the condition that scientists call synesthesia,

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
an unusual cross-talk

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000
between the senses.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000
Here are the numbers one to 12

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000
as I see them --

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.000
every number with its own shape and character.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000
One is a flash of white light.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:51.000
Six is a tiny and very sad black hole.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000
The sketches are in black and white here,

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000
but in my mind they have colors.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000
Three is green.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000
Four is blue.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000
Five is yellow.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000
I paint as well.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.000
And here is one of my paintings.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.000
It's a multiplication of two prime numbers.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000
Three-dimensional shapes

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.000
and the space they create in the middle

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000
creates a new shape,

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000
the answer to the sum.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000
What about bigger numbers?

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:30.000
Well you can't get much bigger than Pi,

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
the mathematical constant.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000
It's an infinite number --

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000
literally goes on forever.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000
In this painting that I made

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:42.000
of the first 20 decimals of Pi,

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000
I take the colors

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.000
and the emotions and the textures

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000
and I pull them all together

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:54.000
into a kind of rolling numerical landscape.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000
But it's not only numbers that I see in colors.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000
Words too, for me,

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000
have colors and emotions

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000
and textures.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000
And this is an opening phrase

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000
from the novel "Lolita."

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:11.000
And Nabokov was himself synesthetic.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000
And you can see here

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.000
how my perception of the sound L

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000
helps the alliteration

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.000
to jump right out.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000
Another example:

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000
a little bit more mathematical.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000
And I wonder if some of you will notice

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000
the construction of the sentence

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.000
from "The Great Gatsby."

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.000
There is a procession of syllables --

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.000
wheat, one;

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000
prairies, two;

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.000
lost Swede towns, three --

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000
one, two, three.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:49.000
And this effect is very pleasant on the mind,

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000
and it helps the sentence

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.000
to feel right.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000
Let's go back to the questions

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.000
I posed you a moment ago.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.000
64 multiplied by 75.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.000
If some of you play chess,

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000
you'll know that 64

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.000
is a square number,

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000
and that's why chessboards,

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000
eight by eight,

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.000
have 64 squares.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.000
So that gives us a form

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.000
that we can picture, that we can perceive.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.000
What about 75?

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000
Well if 100,

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.000
if we think of 100 as being like a square,

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.000
75 would look like this.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.000
So what we need to do now

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.000
is put those two pictures

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000
together in our mind --

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.000
something like this.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:46.000
64 becomes 6,400.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:50.000
And in the right-hand corner,

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.000
you don't have to calculate anything.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000
Four across, four up and down --

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.000
it's 16.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.000
So what the sum is actually asking you to do

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000
is 16,

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:04.000
16, 16.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.000
That's a lot easier

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.000
than the way that the school taught you to do math, I'm sure.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000
It's 16, 16, 16, 48,

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.000
4,800 --

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000
4,800,

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.000
the answer to the sum.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.000
Easy when you know how.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:23.000
(Laughter)

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:26.000
The second question was an Icelandic word.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.000
I'm assuming there are not many people here

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000
who speak Icelandic.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:34.000
So let me narrow the choices down to two.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.000
Hnugginn:

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.000
is it a happy word,

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.000
or a sad word?

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.000
What do you say?

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.000
Okay.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.000
Some people say it's happy.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.000
Most people, a majority of people,

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.000
say sad.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:57.000
And it actually means sad.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:00.000
(Laughter)

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.000
Why do, statistically,

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.000
a majority of people

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.000
say that a word is sad, in this case,

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:10.000
heavy in other cases?

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:13.000
In my theory, language evolves in such a way

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.000
that sounds match,

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.000
correspond with, the subjective,

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.000
with the personal,

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.000
intuitive experience

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.000
of the listener.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:28.000
Let's have a look at the third question.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:32.000
It's a line from a poem by John Keats.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:35.000
Words, like numbers,

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:38.000
express fundamental relationships

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.000
between objects

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000
and events and forces

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.000
that constitute our world.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:47.000
It stands to reason that we, existing in this world,

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.000
should in the course of our lives

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:52.000
absorb intuitively those relationships.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:55.000
And poets, like other artists,

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:58.000
play with those intuitive understandings.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:01.000
In the case of hare,

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.000
it's an ambiguous sound in English.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:06.000
It can also mean the fibers that grow from a head.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.000
And if we think of that --

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.000
let me put the picture up --

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:13.000
the fibers represent vulnerability.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:17.000
They yield to the slightest movement

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:20.000
or motion or emotion.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:24.000
So what you have is an atmosphere

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.000
of vulnerability and tension.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.000
The hare itself, the animal --

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:31.000
not a cat, not a dog, a hare --

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.000
why a hare?

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.000
Because think of the picture --

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.000
not the word, the picture.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.000
The overlong ears,

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.000
the overlarge feet,

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:44.000
helps us to picture, to feel intuitively,

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:47.000
what it means to limp

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:50.000
and to tremble.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.000
So in these few minutes,

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.000
I hope I've been able to share

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:57.000
a little bit of my vision of things

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:00.000
and to show you

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.000
that words can have colors and emotions,

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:06.000
numbers, shapes and personalities.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.000
The world is richer,

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.000
vaster

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:13.000
than it too often seems to be.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:16.000
I hope that I've given you the desire

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:19.000
to learn to see the world with new eyes.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.000
Thank you.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:32.000
(Applause)
