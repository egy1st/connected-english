00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
You know, what I do is write for children,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
and I'm probably America's

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
most widely read children's author, in fact.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
And I always tell people

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
that I don't want to show up looking like a scientist.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
You can have me as a farmer, or in leathers,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
and no one has ever chose farmer.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
I'm here today to talk to you

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
about circles and epiphanies.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
And you know, an epiphany

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
is usually something you find that you dropped someplace.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
You've just got to go around the block

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
to see it as an epiphany.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
That's a painting of a circle.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
A friend of mine did that -- Richard Bollingbroke.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
It's the kind of complicated circle

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
that I'm going to tell you about.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
My circle began back in the '60s

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
in high school in Stow, Ohio

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
where I was the class queer.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
I was the guy beaten up bloody

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
every week in the boys' room,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
until one teacher saved my life.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
She saved my life by letting me go to the bathroom

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
in the teachers' lounge.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
She did it in secret.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
She did it for three years.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
And I had to get out of town.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
I had a thumb, I had 85 dollars,

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.000
and I ended up in San Francisco, California --

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
met a lover --

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
and back in the '80s, found it necessary

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.000
to begin work on AIDS organizations.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
About three or four years ago,

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
I got a phone call in the middle of the night

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
from that teacher, Mrs. Posten,

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
who said, "I need to see you.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
I'm disappointed

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
that we never got to know each other as adults.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
Could you please come to Ohio,

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
and please bring that man

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
that I know you have found by now.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
And I should mention

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
that I have pancreatic cancer,

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
and I'd like you to please

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
be quick about this."

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
Well, the next day we were in Cleveland.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
We took a look at her, we laughed, we cried,

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000
and we knew that she needed to be in a hospice.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
We found her one, we got her there,

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
and we took care of her

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
and watched over her family,

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
because it was necessary.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
It's something we knew how to do.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.000
And just as the woman who wanted to know me as an adult

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
got to know me,

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
she turned into a box of ashes

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000
and was placed in my hands.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
And what had happened

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
was the circle had closed,

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
it had become a circle --

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
and that epiphany I talked about

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
presented itself.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
The epiphany is

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000
that death is a part of life.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000
She saved my life;

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.000
I and my partner saved hers.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
And you know, that part of life needs everything

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
that the rest of life does.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
It needs truth and beauty,

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000
and I'm so happy it's been mentioned so much here today.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000
It also needs --

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
it needs dignity,

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000
love and pleasure,

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000
and it's our job to hand those things out.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
Thank you.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.000
(Applause)
