00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Space,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
we all know what it looks like.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
We've been surrounded by images of space

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
our whole lives,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
from the speculative images

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
of science fiction

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
to the inspirational visions of artists

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
to the increasingly beautiful pictures

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
made possible by complex technologies.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
But whilst we have

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
an overwhelmingly vivid

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
visual understanding of space,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
we have no sense of what space sounds like.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
And indeed, most people associate space with silence.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
But the story of how

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
we came to understand the universe

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
is just as much a story of listening

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
as it is by looking.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
And yet despite this,

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
hardly any of us have ever heard space.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
How many of you here

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
could describe the sound

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
of a single planet or star?

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
Well in case you've ever wondered,

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
this is what the Sun sounds like.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:18.000
(Static)

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.000
(Crackling)

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:28.000
(Static)

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000
(Crackling)

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000
This is the planet Jupiter.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:55.000
(Soft crackling)

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
And this is the space probe Cassini

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.000
pirouetting through the ice rings of Saturn.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:22.000
(Crackling)

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000
This is a a highly condensed clump

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
of neutral matter,

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.000
spinning in the distant universe.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:49.000
(Tapping)

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
So my artistic practice

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
is all about listening

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000
to the weird and wonderful noises

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000
emitted by the magnificent celestial objects

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000
that make up our universe.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
And you may wonder,

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
how do we know what these sounds are?

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
How can we tell the difference

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
between the sound of the Sun

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000
and the sound of a pulsar?

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
Well the answer

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
is the science of radio astronomy.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000
Radio astronomers

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000
study radio waves from space

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.000
using sensitive antennas and receivers,

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000
which give them precise information

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.000
about what an astronomical object is

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
and where it is in our night sky.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
And just like the signals

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000
that we send and receive here on Earth,

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000
we can convert these transmissions into sound

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.000
using simple analog techniques.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.000
And therefore, it's through listening

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000
that we've come to uncover

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.000
some of the universe's most important secrets --

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.000
its scale, what it's made of

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000
and even how old it is.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
So today, I'm going to tell you a short story

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
of the history of the universe through listening.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
It's punctuated

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000
by three quick anecdotes,

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000
which show how accidental encounters

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000
with strange noises

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.000
gave us some of the most important information

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000
we have about space.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000
Now this story doesn't start

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000
with vast telescopes

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.000
or futuristic spacecraft,

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.000
but a rather more humble technology --

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.000
and in fact, the very medium

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.000
which gave us the telecommunications revolution

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
that we're all part of today:

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
the telephone.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.000
It's 1876, it's in Boston,

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000
and this is Alexander Graham Bell

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000
who was working with Thomas Watson

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.000
on the invention of the telephone.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.000
A key part of their technical set up

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000
was a half-mile long length of wire,

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000
which was thrown across the rooftops

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.000
of several houses in Boston.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.000
The line carried the telephone signals

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.000
that would later make Bell a household name.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.000
But like any long length of charged wire,

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000
it also inadvertently became

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000
an antenna.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000
Thomas Watson

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000
spent hours listening

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000
to the strange crackles and hisses

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.000
and chirps and whistles

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.000
that his accidental antenna detected.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000
Now you have to remember,

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000
this is 10 years before

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:25.000
Heinrich Hertz proved the existence of radio waves --

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.000
15 years before Nikola Tesla's four-tuned circuit --

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:32.000
nearly 20 years before Marconi's first broadcast.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.000
So Thomas Watson wasn't listening to us.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000
We didn't have the technology

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000
to transmit.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.000
So what were these strange noises?

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000
Watson was in fact listening

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000
to very low-frequency radio emissions

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.000
caused by nature.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.000
Some of the crackles and pops were lightning,

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.000
but the eerie whistles

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.000
and curiously melodious chirps

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.000
had a rather more exotic origin.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.000
Using the very first telephone,

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000
Watson was in fact

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000
dialed into the heavens.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.000
As he correctly guessed,

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.000
some of these sounds were caused

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.000
by activity on the surface of the Sun.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.000
It was a solar wind

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.000
interacting with our ionosphere

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000
that he was listening to --

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000
a phenomena which we can see

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.000
at the extreme northern and southern latitudes of our planet

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000
as the aurora.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.000
So whilst inventing the technology

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:34.000
that would usher in the telecommunications revolution,

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000
Watson had discovered

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.000
that the star at the center of our solar system

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.000
emitted powerful radio waves.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.000
He had accidentally been the first person

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000
to tune in to them.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000
Fast-forward 50 years,

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:52.000
and Bell and Watson's technology

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000
has completely transformed

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000
global communications.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.000
But going from slinging some wire

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000
across rooftops in Boston

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.000
to laying thousands and thousands of miles of cable

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.000
on the Atlantic Ocean seabed

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.000
is no easy matter.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000
And so before long,

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000
Bell were looking to new technologies

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.000
to optimize their revolution.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.000
Radio could carry sound without wires.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.000
But the medium is lossy --

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:23.000
it's subject to a lot of noise and interference.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.000
So Bell employed an engineer

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.000
to study those noises,

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000
to try and find out where they came from,

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000
with a view towards building

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:34.000
the perfect hardware codec, which would get rid of them

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000
so they could think about using radio

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.000
for the purposes of telephony.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.000
Most of the noises

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:44.000
that the engineer, Karl Jansky, investigated

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.000
were fairly prosaic in origin.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.000
They turned out to be lightning

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:51.000
or sources of electrical power.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:54.000
But there was one persistent noise

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.000
that Jansky couldn't identify,

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.000
and it seemed to appear

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000
in his radio headset

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.000
four minutes earlier each day.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.000
Now any astronomer will tell you,

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.000
this is the telltale sign

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:10.000
of something that doesn't originate from Earth.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:14.000
Jansky had made a historic discovery,

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:17.000
that celestial objects could emit radio waves

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.000
as well as light waves.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.000
Fifty years on

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:24.000
from Watson's accidental encounter with the Sun,

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000
Jansky's careful listening

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:29.000
ushered in a new age of space exploration:

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000
the radio astronomy age.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.000
Over the next few years,

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:37.000
astronomers connected up their antennas to loudspeakers

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.000
and learned about our radio sky,

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.000
about Jupiter and the Sun,

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.000
by listening.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.000
Let's jump ahead again.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.000
It's 1964,

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.000
and we're back at Bell Labs.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000
And once again,

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:54.000
two scientists have got a problem with noise.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:57.000
Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.000
were using the horn antenna

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.000
at Bell's Holmdel laboratory

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.000
to study the Milky Way

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.000
with extraordinary precision.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.000
They were really listening

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.000
to the galaxy in high fidelity.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.000
There was a glitch in their soundtrack.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.000
A mysterious persistent noise

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.000
was disrupting their research.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.000
It was in the microwave range,

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.000
and it appeared to be coming

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.000
from all directions simultaneously.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.000
Now this didn't make any sense,

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:28.000
and like any reasonable engineer or scientist,

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:31.000
they assumed that the problem must be the technology itself,

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.000
it must be the dish.

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:36.000
There were pigeons roosting in the dish.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.000
And so perhaps once they cleaned up the pigeon droppings,

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.000
get the disk kind of operational again,

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:44.000
normal operations would resume.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:47.000
But the noise didn't disappear.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.000
The mysterious noise

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:52.000
that Penzias and Wilson were listening to

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:55.000
turned out to be the oldest and most significant sound

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.000
that anyone had ever heard.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.000
It was cosmic radiation

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:03.000
left over from the very birth of the universe.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:06.000
This was the first experimental evidence

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.000
that the Big Bang existed

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:11.000
and the universe was born at a precise moment

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:15.000
some 14.7 billion years ago.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.000
So our story ends

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.000
at the beginning --

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:23.000
the beginning of all things, the Big Bang.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:26.000
This is the noise that Penzias and Wilson heard --

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:29.000
the oldest sound that you're ever going to hear,

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:32.000
the cosmic microwave background radiation

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.000
left over from the Big Bang.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:49.000
(Fuzz)

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.000
Thanks.

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:55.000
(Applause)
