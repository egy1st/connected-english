00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
My name is Joshua Walters.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
I'm a performer.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:15.000
(Beatboxing)

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
(Laughter)

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
(Applause)

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
But as far as being a performer,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
I'm also diagnosed

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
bipolar.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
I reframe that as a positive

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
because the crazier I get onstage,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
the more entertaining I become.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
When I was 16 in San Francisco,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
I had my breakthrough manic episode

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
in which I thought I was Jesus Christ.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Maybe you thought that was scary,

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
but actually there's no amount of drugs you can take

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
that can get you as high

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
as if you think you're Jesus Christ.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
(Laughter)

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
I was sent to a place,

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
a psych ward,

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
and in the psych ward,

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
everyone is doing their own one-man show.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.000
(Laughter)

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
There's no audience like this

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
to justify their rehearsal time.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
They're just practicing.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
One day they'll get here.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
Now when I got out,

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
I was diagnosed

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
and I was given medications

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
by a psychiatrist.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
"Okay, Josh, why don't we give you some --

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
why don't we give you some Zyprexa.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
Okay? Mmhmm?

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
At least that's what it says on my pen."

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.000
(Laughter)

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
Some of you are in the field, I can see.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
I can feel your noise.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
The first half of high school

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
was the struggle of the manic episode,

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
and the second half

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
was the overmedications of these drugs,

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
where I was sleeping through high school.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.000
The second half was just one big nap, pretty much, in class.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
When I got out

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
I had a choice.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
I could either deny

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
my mental illness

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.000
or embrace

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
my mental skillness.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
(Bugle sound)

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
There's a movement going on right now

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000
to reframe mental illness as a positive --

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000
at least the hypomanic edge part of it.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000
Now if you don't know what hypomania is,

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
it's like an engine that's out of control,

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
maybe a Ferrari engine, with no breaks.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
Many of the speakers here, many of you in the audience,

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
have that creative edge,

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
if you know what I'm talking about.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
You're driven to do something

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
that everyone has told you is impossible.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
And there's a book -- John Gartner.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000
John Gartner wrote this book called "The Hypomanic Edge"

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000
in which Christopher Columbus and Ted Turner and Steve Jobs

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000
and all these business minds

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000
have this edge to compete.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000
A different book was written not too long ago

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
in the mid-90s

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000
called "Touched With Fire" by Kay Redfield Jamison

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
in which it was looked at in a creative sense

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000
in which Mozart and Beethoven and Van Gogh

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000
all have this manic depression that they were suffering with.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000
Some of them committed suicide.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000
So it wasn't all

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.000
the good side of the illness.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.000
Now recently,

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.000
there's been development in this field.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.000
And there was an article written in the New York Times,

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000
September 2010,

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
that stated:

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
"Just Manic Enough."

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
Just be manic enough

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.000
in which investors who are looking for entrepreneurs

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.000
that have this kind of spectrum --

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000
you know what I'm talking about --

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000
not maybe full bipolar,

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.000
but they're in the bipolar spectrum --

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000
where on one side,

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.000
maybe you think you're Jesus,

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.000
and on the other side

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000
maybe they just make you a lot of money.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000
(Laughter)

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000
Your call. Your call.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000
And everyone's somewhere in the middle.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.000
Everyone's somewhere in the middle.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.000
So maybe, you know,

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000
there's no such thing

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000
as crazy,

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000
and being diagnosed with a mental illness

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000
doesn't mean you're crazy.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
But maybe it just means

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000
you're more sensitive

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000
to what most people can't see

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000
or feel.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:02.000
Maybe no one's really crazy.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:07.000
Everyone is just a little bit mad.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.000
How much

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.000
depends on where you fall in the spectrum.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000
How much

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:24.000
depends on how lucky you are.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000
Thank you.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:30.000
(Applause)
