WEBVTT

00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:02.200
My name is Emiliano Salinas

00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:06.400
and I'm going to talk about the role

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:08.500
we members of society play

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:09.800
in the violent atmosphere

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:13.130
this country is living in right now.

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:16.200
I was born in 1976.

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:19.600
I grew up in a traditional Mexican family.

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:21.600
As a child, I had a pretty normal life:

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:25.700
I would go to school, play with my friends and cousins.

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:28.000
But then my father became President of Mexico

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.500
and my life changed.

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.800
What I'm about to say,

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:35.300
at least some of what I'm about to say,

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:37.100
will cause controversy.

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:40.200
Firstly, because I'm the one who's going to say it.

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.200
And secondly, because what I'm going to say is true,

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.200
and it will make a lot of people nervous

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:47.850
because it's something we don't want to hear.

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.900
But it's imperative that we listen

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:52.258
because it's undeniable and definitive.

00:00:52.258 --> 00:00:54.000
It will also make members of

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.935
criminal organizations nervous

00:00:55.935 --> 00:00:57.700
for the same reasons.

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:00.900
I'm going to talk about the role

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:02.738
we members of society play

00:01:02.738 --> 00:01:04.300
in this phenomenon,

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:06.000
and about four different response levels

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.300
we citizens have against violence.

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:12.500
I know many will find it difficult to separate the fact

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:14.400
that I'm Carlos Salinas de Gortari's son

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.200
from the fact that I'm a citizen

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.000
concerned about the country's current situation.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.200
Don't worry.

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.200
It's not necessary for understanding

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:24.700
the importance of what I'm going to say.

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:26.400
I think we have a problem in Mexico.

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:27.700
We have a big problem.

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:29.700
I think there's consensus on this.

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:30.700
No one argues --

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:32.000
we all agree there's a problem.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.500
What we don't agree on

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:36.800
is what the problem actually is.

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:41.500
Is it the Zetas? The drug traffickers? The government?

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:45.700
Corruption? Poverty? Or is it something else?

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:47.900
I think none of these is the problem.

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:50.200
I don't mean they don't deserve attention.

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:52.670
But we won't be able to take care of any of those things

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:54.800
if we don't solve the real problem

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:56.300
we have in Mexico first.

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:57.690
The real problem we have is

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:00.900
most of us Mexicans, we believe we are victims

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:02.646
of our circumstances.

00:02:02.646 --> 00:02:05.000
We are a country of victims.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.750
Historically, we've always acted as victims

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:09.520
of something or somebody.

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:11.800
We were victims of the Spaniards.

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:13.820
Then we were victims of the French.

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:16.264
Then we were victims of Don Porfirio.

00:02:16.264 --> 00:02:18.416
Then we were victims of the PRI.

00:02:18.416 --> 00:02:20.100
Even of Salinas.

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:22.221
And of El Peje.

00:02:22.221 --> 00:02:25.207
And now of the Zetas and the traffickers and the criminals and the kidnappers ...

00:02:25.207 --> 00:02:27.687
Hold on! Wait a minute!

00:02:27.687 --> 00:02:31.222
What if none of these things is the problem?

00:02:31.222 --> 00:02:34.525
The problem is not the things we feel victims of.

00:02:34.525 --> 00:02:38.725
The problem is that we play the role of victims.

00:02:38.725 --> 00:02:42.500
We need to open our eyes and see that we are not victims.

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:44.700
If only we stopped feeling like victims,

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:46.000
if we stopped acting as victims,

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.222
our country would change so much!

00:02:49.235 --> 00:02:52.700
I'm going to talk about how to go from a society

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:54.399
that acts as a victim of circumstances

00:02:54.399 --> 00:02:57.300
to a responsible, involved society

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:00.836
that takes the future of its country in its own hands.

00:03:00.836 --> 00:03:03.300
I'm going to talk about four different levels

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:05.400
of civil response against violence,

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:07.700
from weakest

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:10.000
to strongest.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.500
The first level, the weakest level of civil response against violence,

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:15.400
is denial and apathy.

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:18.000
Today, much of Mexican society is in denial

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000
of the situation we're going through.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.258
We want to go on with our daily life

00:03:23.258 --> 00:03:25.800
even though we are not living under normal circumstances.

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:28.500
Daily life in our country is,

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:31.729
to say the least,

00:03:31.729 --> 00:03:33.693
under extraordinary, exceptional circumstances.

00:03:33.693 --> 00:03:37.500
It's like someone who has a serious illness

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:39.500
and pretends it's the flu

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:41.470
and it will just go away.

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:44.711
We want to pretend that Mexico has the flu.

00:03:44.711 --> 00:03:46.813
But it doesn't.

00:03:46.813 --> 00:03:49.030
Mexico has cancer.

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:51.200
And if we don't do something about it,

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:54.354
the cancer will end up killing it.

00:03:54.354 --> 00:03:56.800
We need to move Mexican society

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:58.800
from denial and apathy

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:01.200
to the next level of citizen response,

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:04.332
which is, effectively, recognition.

00:04:04.332 --> 00:04:08.166
And that recognition will sow fear --

00:04:08.166 --> 00:04:11.325
recognizing the seriousness of the situation.

00:04:11.325 --> 00:04:14.972
But, fear is better than apathy

00:04:14.972 --> 00:04:18.286
because fear makes us do something.

00:04:18.286 --> 00:04:21.529
Many people in Mexico

00:04:21.529 --> 00:04:23.486
are afraid today.

00:04:23.486 --> 00:04:24.962
We're very afraid.

00:04:24.962 --> 00:04:27.100
And we're acting out of that fear.

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:28.800
And let me tell you what the problem is

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:30.500
with acting out of fear --

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:33.000
and this is the second level of civil response:

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:34.600
fear.

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:37.000
Let's think about Mexican streets:

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.500
they're unsafe because of violence,

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:43.000
so people stay at home.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:47.200
Does that make streets more or less safe?

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:48.200
Less safe!

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:50.000
So streets become more desolate and unsafe,

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:51.400
so we stay home more --

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:53.800
which makes streets even more desolate and unsafe,

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:55.300
and we stay home even more.

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:58.000
This vicious circle ends up with the whole population

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000
stuck inside their houses, scared to death --

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.500
even more afraid than when we were out on the streets.

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:05.000
We need to confront this fear.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.400
We need to move Mexican society,

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:10.000
the members of society who are at this level,

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.200
to the next level, which is action.

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:16.200
We need to face our fears and take back our streets,

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:19.000
our cities, our neighborhoods.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:25.200
For many people, acting involves courage.

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:27.200
We go from fear to courage.

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:30.000
They say, "I can't take it anymore.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000
Let's do something about it."

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.000
Recently --

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.000
this is a sensitive figure --

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.200
35 public lynchings have been recorded

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:42.800
so far in 2010

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:47.000
in Mexico.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.400
Usually it's one or two a year.

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:53.000
Now we're experiencing one every week.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.000
This shows that society is desperate

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.500
and it's taking the law into its own hands.

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:02.000
Unfortunately, violent action --

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.000
though action is better than no action --

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.000
but taking part in it

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.500
only disguises violence.

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:13.000
If I'm violent with you

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000
and you respond with violence,

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000
you become part of the violence

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:21.000
and you just disguise my violence.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.200
So civil action

00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:25.000
is vital,

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000
but it's also vital to take people

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.200
who are at the level of courage

00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:31.000
and violent action

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.000
to the next level,

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:34.600
which is non-violent action.

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:37.500
It's pacific, coordinated civil action,

00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:39.500
which doesn't mean passive action.

00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:42.300
It means it's determined and effective,

00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:44.800
but not violent.

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:47.500
There are examples of this kind of action in Mexico.

00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:52.200
Two years ago, in Galena City, Chihuahua,

00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:54.000
a member of the community was kidnapped,

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:55.700
Eric Le Barón.

00:06:55.700 --> 00:06:57.300
His brothers, Benjamín and Julián,

00:06:57.300 --> 00:06:59.300
got together with the rest of the community

00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:01.700
to think of the best course of action:

00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:03.800
to pay the ransom,

00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:08.300
to take up arms and go after the kidnappers

00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:10.600
or to ask the government for help.

00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:13.000
In the end, Benjamín and Julián decided

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000
the best thing they could do

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.800
was to organize the community and act together.

00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:19.500
So what did they do?

00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:21.800
They mobilized the whole community of Le Barón

00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:24.600
to go to Chihuahua,

00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:27.000
where they organized a sit-in

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.300
in the central park of the city.

00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:31.200
They sent a message to the kidnappers:

00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:34.200
"If you want your ransom come and get it.

00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:36.600
We'll be waiting for you right here."

00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:38.600
They stayed there.

00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:41.100
Seven days later, Eric was set free

00:07:41.100 --> 00:07:43.100
and was able to return home.

00:07:43.100 --> 00:07:46.900
This is an example of what an organized society can do,

00:07:46.900 --> 00:07:49.500
a society that acts.

00:07:49.500 --> 00:07:51.700
Of course, criminals can respond.

00:07:51.700 --> 00:07:53.700
And in this case, they did.

00:07:53.700 --> 00:07:57.000
On July 7th, 2009,

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.500
Benjamín Le Barón was murdered.

00:07:59.500 --> 00:08:02.200
But Julián Le Barón keeps working

00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:04.400
and he has been mobilizing communities in Chihuahua

00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:07.000
for over a year.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.700
And for over a year he has known that a price has been put on his head.

00:08:09.700 --> 00:08:11.500
But he keeps fighting.

00:08:11.500 --> 00:08:13.000
He keeps organizing.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.000
He keeps mobilizing.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.600
These heroic acts are present all over the country.

00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:20.000
With a thousand Juliáns working together,

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.000
Mexico would be a very different country.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:23.500
And they're out there!

00:08:23.500 --> 00:08:28.000
They just have to raise their hands.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:34.000
I was born in Mexico, I grew up in Mexico

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:39.000
and along the way, I learned to love Mexico.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.200
I think anyone who has stepped foot on this land --

00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:44.200
not to mention all Mexican people --

00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:47.000
will agree that it's not difficult

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:50.000
to love Mexico.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.500
I've traveled a lot

00:08:52.500 --> 00:08:58.000
and nowhere else have I found the passion Mexicans have.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.000
That devotion we feel

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000
for the national football team.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000
That devotion we show

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.000
in helping victims of disasters,

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.000
such as the earthquake in 1985

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.500
or this year's floods.

00:09:10.500 --> 00:09:16.000
The passion with which we've been singing the national anthem

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:17.500
since we were kids.

00:09:17.500 --> 00:09:19.000
When we thought Masiosare

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:22.000
was the strange enemy,

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.500
and we sang, with a childlike heart,

00:09:24.500 --> 00:09:29.700
"a soldier in each son."

00:09:29.700 --> 00:09:32.000
I think the biggest insult,

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.000
the worst way you can offend a Mexican

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:35.800
is to insult their mother.

00:09:35.800 --> 00:09:40.000
A mother is the most sacred thing in life.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:43.000
Mexico is our mother and today she cries out for her children.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:46.000
We are going through the darkest moment

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.000
in our recent history.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:51.700
Our mother, Mexico, is being violated before our very eyes.

00:09:51.700 --> 00:09:54.700
What are we going to do?

00:09:54.700 --> 00:09:57.200
Masiosare, the strange enemy, is here.

00:09:57.200 --> 00:10:02.000
Where is the soldier in each son?

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.000
Mahatma Gandhi,

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:07.800
one of the greatest civil fighters of all time, said,

00:10:07.800 --> 00:10:11.800
"Be the change you wish to see in the world."

00:10:11.800 --> 00:10:15.000
Today in Mexico we're asking for Gandhis.

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:17.500
We need Gandhis.

00:10:17.500 --> 00:10:20.500
We need men and women who love Mexico

00:10:20.500 --> 00:10:23.500
and who are willing to take action.

00:10:23.500 --> 00:10:28.500
This is a call for every true Mexican

00:10:28.500 --> 00:10:30.500
to join this initiative.

00:10:30.500 --> 00:10:32.000
This is a call

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:35.000
so that every single thing we love about Mexico --

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.000
the festivals, the markets,

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.000
the restaurants, the cantinas,

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:42.000
the tequila, the mariachis, the serenades,

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:45.800
the posadas, El Grito, the Day of the Dead,

00:10:45.800 --> 00:10:49.200
San Miguel, the joy, the passion for life,

00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:53.400
the fight and everything it means to be Mexican --

00:10:53.400 --> 00:10:57.800
doesn't disappear from this world.

00:10:57.800 --> 00:11:01.000
We're facing a very powerful opponent.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:03.500
But we are many more.

00:11:03.500 --> 00:11:06.000
They can take a man's life.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.000
Anyone can kill me,

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:09.500
or you, or you.

00:11:09.500 --> 00:11:12.000
But no one can kill

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.500
the spirit of true Mexicans.

00:11:14.500 --> 00:11:16.500
The battle is won,

00:11:16.500 --> 00:11:19.400
but we still have to fight it.

00:11:19.400 --> 00:11:25.000
2000 years ago, the Roman poet Juvenal

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:28.000
said something that today echoes

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:31.000
in the heart of every true Mexican.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:35.300
He said, "Count it the greatest sin

00:11:35.300 --> 00:11:41.000
to prefer life to honor,

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:45.000
and for the sake of living

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:48.600
to lose what makes life worth living."

00:11:48.600 --> 00:11:50.000
Thank you.

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:53.000
(Applause)
