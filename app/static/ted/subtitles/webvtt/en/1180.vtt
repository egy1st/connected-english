00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
I'd like to begin with a thought experiment.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Imagine that it's 4,000 years into the future.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Civilization as we know it

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
has ceased to exist --

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
no books,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
no electronic devices,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
no Facebook or Twitter.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
All knowledge of the English language and the English alphabet

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
has been lost.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Now imagine archeologists

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
digging through the rubble of one of our cities.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
What might they find?

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Well perhaps some rectangular pieces of plastic

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
with strange symbols on them.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Perhaps some circular pieces of metal.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
Maybe some cylindrical containers

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
with some symbols on them.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
And perhaps one archeologist becomes an instant celebrity

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
when she discovers --

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
buried in the hills somewhere in North America --

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
massive versions of these same symbols.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
Now let's ask ourselves,

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
what could such artifacts say about us

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
to people 4,000 years into the future?

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
This is no hypothetical question.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
In fact, this is exactly the kind of question we're faced with

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
when we try to understand the Indus Valley civilization,

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
which existed 4,000 years ago.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
The Indus civilization was roughly contemporaneous

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
with the much better known Egyptian and the Mesopotamian civilizations,

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
but it was actually much larger than either of these two civilizations.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
It occupied the area

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
of approximately one million square kilometers,

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
covering what is now Pakistan,

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
Northwestern India

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
and parts of Afghanistan and Iran.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
Given that it was such a vast civilization,

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.000
you might expect to find really powerful rulers, kings,

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
and huge monuments glorifying these powerful kings.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
In fact,

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
what archeologists have found is none of that.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
They've found small objects such as these.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
Here's an example of one of these objects.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
Well obviously this is a replica.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
But who is this person?

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
A king? A god?

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
A priest?

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
Or perhaps an ordinary person

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
like you or me?

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
We don't know.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
But the Indus people also left behind artifacts with writing on them.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
Well no, not pieces of plastic,

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000
but stone seals, copper tablets,

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
pottery and, surprisingly,

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
one large sign board,

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
which was found buried near the gate of a city.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
Now we don't know if it says Hollywood,

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
or even Bollywood for that matter.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
In fact, we don't even know

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
what any of these objects say,

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000
and that's because the Indus script is undeciphered.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
We don't know what any of these symbols mean.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
The symbols are most commonly found on seals.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
So you see up there one such object.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000
It's the square object with the unicorn-like animal on it.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
Now that's a magnificent piece of art.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
So how big do you think that is?

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
Perhaps that big?

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
Or maybe that big?

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
Well let me show you.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.000
Here's a replica of one such seal.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
It's only about one inch by one inch in size --

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
pretty tiny.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
So what were these used for?

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000
We know that these were used for stamping clay tags

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000
that were attached to bundles of goods that were sent from one place to the other.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000
So you know those packing slips you get on your FedEx boxes?

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000
These were used to make those kinds of packing slips.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000
You might wonder what these objects contain

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000
in terms of their text.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000
Perhaps they're the name of the sender

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000
or some information about the goods

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.000
that are being sent from one place to the other -- we don't know.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
We need to decipher the script to answer that question.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000
Deciphering the script

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
is not just an intellectual puzzle;

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000
it's actually become a question

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000
that's become deeply intertwined

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000
with the politics and the cultural history of South Asia.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.000
In fact, the script has become a battleground of sorts

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000
between three different groups of people.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000
First, there's a group of people

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000
who are very passionate in their belief

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000
that the Indus script

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000
does not represent a language at all.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000
These people believe that the symbols

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.000
are very similar to the kind of symbols you find on traffic signs

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.000
or the emblems you find on shields.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
There's a second group of people

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.000
who believe that the Indus script represents an Indo-European language.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000
If you look at a map of India today,

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000
you'll see that most of the languages spoken in North India

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000
belong to the Indo-European language family.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000
So some people believe that the Indus script

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.000
represents an ancient Indo-European language such as Sanskrit.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000
There's a last group of people

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.000
who believe that the Indus people

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.000
were the ancestors of people living in South India today.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000
These people believe that the Indus script

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000
represents an ancient form

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000
of the Dravidian language family,

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.000
which is the language family spoken in much of South India today.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000
And the proponents of this theory

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.000
point to that small pocket of Dravidian-speaking people in the North,

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000
actually near Afghanistan,

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.000
and they say that perhaps, sometime in the past,

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.000
Dravidian languages were spoken all over India

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000
and that this suggests

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.000
that the Indus civilization is perhaps also Dravidian.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.000
Which of these hypotheses can be true?

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000
We don't know, but perhaps if you deciphered the script,

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000
you would be able to answer this question.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000
But deciphering the script is a very challenging task.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000
First, there's no Rosetta Stone.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000
I don't mean the software;

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000
I mean an ancient artifact

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000
that contains in the same text

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.000
both a known text and an unknown text.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.000
We don't have such an artifact for the Indus script.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000
And furthermore, we don't even know what language they spoke.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000
And to make matters even worse,

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000
most of the text that we have are extremely short.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000
So as I showed you, they're usually found on these seals

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000
that are very, very tiny.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000
And so given these formidable obstacles,

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000
one might wonder and worry

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000
whether one will ever be able to decipher the Indus script.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.000
In the rest of my talk,

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000
I'd like to tell you about how I learned to stop worrying

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000
and love the challenge posed by the Indus script.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.000
I've always been fascinated by the Indus script

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.000
ever since I read about it in a middle school textbook.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000
And why was I fascinated?

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:50.000
Well it's the last major undeciphered script in the ancient world.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.000
My career path led me to become a computational neuroscientist,

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.000
so in my day job,

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000
I create computer models of the brain

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.000
to try to understand how the brain makes predictions,

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000
how the brain makes decisions,

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.000
how the brain learns and so on.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.000
But in 2007, my path crossed again with the Indus script.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.000
That's when I was in India,

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.000
and I had the wonderful opportunity

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.000
to meet with some Indian scientists

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.000
who were using computer models to try to analyze the script.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.000
And so it was then that I realized

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.000
there was an opportunity for me to collaborate with these scientists,

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.000
and so I jumped at that opportunity.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.000
And I'd like to describe some of the results that we have found.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:28.000
Or better yet, let's all collectively decipher.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000
Are you ready?

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.000
The first thing that you need to do when you have an undeciphered script

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.000
is try to figure out the direction of writing.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.000
Here are two texts that contain some symbols on them.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.000
Can you tell me

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:43.000
if the direction of writing is right to left or left to right?

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:46.000
I'll give you a couple of seconds.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:49.000
Okay. Right to left, how many? Okay.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000
Okay. Left to right?

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000
Oh, it's almost 50/50. Okay.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000
The answer is:

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.000
if you look at the left-hand side of the two texts,

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.000
you'll notice that there's a cramping of signs,

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000
and it seems like 4,000 years ago,

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000
when the scribe was writing from right to left,

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.000
they ran out of space.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.000
And so they had to cram the sign.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.000
One of the signs is also below the text on the top.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.000
This suggests the direction of writing

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.000
was probably from right to left,

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.000
and so that's one of the first things we know,

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:19.000
that directionality is a very key aspect of linguistic scripts.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.000
And the Indus script now has

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.000
this particular property.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.000
What other properties of language does the script show?

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.000
Languages contain patterns.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000
If I give you the letter Q

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:32.000
and ask you to predict the next letter, what do you think that would be?

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.000
Most of you said U, which is right.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000
Now if I asked you to predict one more letter,

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.000
what do you think that would be?

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:41.000
Now there's several thoughts. There's E. It could be I. It could be A,

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:44.000
but certainly not B, C or D, right?

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:47.000
The Indus script also exhibits similar kinds of patterns.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:50.000
There's a lot of text that start with this diamond-shaped symbol.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000
And this in turn tends to be followed

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000
by this quotation marks-like symbol.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.000
And this is very similar to a Q and U example.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.000
This symbol can in turn be followed

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:01.000
by these fish-like symbols and some other signs,

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.000
but never by these other signs at the bottom.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.000
And furthermore, there's some signs

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.000
that really prefer the end of texts,

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.000
such as this jar-shaped sign,

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.000
and this sign, in fact, happens to be

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.000
the most frequently occurring sign in the script.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:16.000
Given such patterns, here was our idea.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.000
The idea was to use a computer

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.000
to learn these patterns,

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:23.000
and so we gave the computer the existing texts.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.000
And the computer learned a statistical model

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.000
of which symbols tend to occur together

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.000
and which symbols tend to follow each other.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000
Given the computer model,

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:34.000
we can test the model by essentially quizzing it.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.000
So we could deliberately erase some symbols,

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.000
and we can ask it to predict the missing symbols.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.000
Here are some examples.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.000
You may regard this

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.000
as perhaps the most ancient game

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:52.000
of Wheel of Fortune.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.000
What we found

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.000
was that the computer was successful in 75 percent of the cases

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.000
in predicting the correct symbol.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.000
In the rest of the cases,

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:04.000
typically the second best guess or third best guess was the right answer.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.000
There's also practical use

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.000
for this particular procedure.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.000
There's a lot of these texts that are damaged.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.000
Here's an example of one such text.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.000
And we can use the computer model now to try to complete this text

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.000
and make a best guess prediction.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:20.000
Here's an example of a symbol that was predicted.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.000
And this could be really useful as we try to decipher the script

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:25.000
by generating more data that we can analyze.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:28.000
Now here's one other thing you can do with the computer model.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.000
So imagine a monkey

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.000
sitting at a keyboard.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:35.000
I think you might get a random jumble of letters that looks like this.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.000
Such a random jumble of letters

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.000
is said to have a very high entropy.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.000
This is a physics and information theory term.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:44.000
But just imagine it's a really random jumble of letters.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:48.000
How many of you have ever spilled coffee on a keyboard?

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.000
You might have encountered the stuck-key problem --

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:53.000
so basically the same symbol being repeated over and over again.

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:56.000
This kind of a sequence is said to have a very low entropy

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.000
because there's no variation at all.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:01.000
Language, on the other hand, has an intermediate level of entropy;

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.000
it's neither too rigid,

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.000
nor is it too random.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.000
What about the Indus script?

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:11.000
Here's a graph that plots the entropies of a whole bunch of sequences.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.000
At the very top you find the uniformly random sequence,

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.000
which is a random jumble of letters --

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:17.000
and interestingly, we also find

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:20.000
the DNA sequence from the human genome and instrumental music.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.000
And both of these are very, very flexible,

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.000
which is why you find them in the very high range.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.000
At the lower end of the scale,

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.000
you find a rigid sequence, a sequence of all A's,

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.000
and you also find a computer program,

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.000
in this case in the language Fortran,

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.000
which obeys really strict rules.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.000
Linguistic scripts

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.000
occupy the middle range.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.000
Now what about the Indus script?

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.000
We found that the Indus script

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.000
actually falls within the range of the linguistic scripts.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.000
When this result was first published,

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:49.000
it was highly controversial.

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:52.000
There were people who raised a hue and cry,

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:54.000
and these people were the ones who believed

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:57.000
that the Indus script does not represent language.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.000
I even started to get some hate mail.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.000
My students said

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:04.000
that I should really seriously consider getting some protection.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:06.000
Who'd have thought

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.000
that deciphering could be a dangerous profession?

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.000
What does this result really show?

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.000
It shows that the Indus script

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.000
shares an important property of language.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.000
So, as the old saying goes,

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.000
if it looks like a linguistic script

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.000
and it acts like a linguistic script,

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:23.000
then perhaps we may have a linguistic script on our hands.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.000
What other evidence is there

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.000
that the script could actually encode language?

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:30.000
Well linguistic scripts can actually encode multiple languages.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:33.000
So for example, here's the same sentence written in English

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.000
and the same sentence written in Dutch

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:37.000
using the same letters of the alphabet.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:40.000
If you don't know Dutch and you only know English

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:42.000
and I give you some words in Dutch,

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:44.000
you'll tell me that these words contain

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:46.000
some very unusual patterns.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.000
Some things are not right,

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:51.000
and you'll say these words are probably not English words.

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.000
The same thing happens in the case of the Indus script.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.000
The computer found several texts --

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:57.000
two of them are shown here --

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.000
that have very unusual patterns.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.000
So for example the first text:

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:04.000
there's a doubling of this jar-shaped sign.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.000
This sign is the most frequently-occurring sign

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.000
in the Indus script,

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.000
and it's only in this text

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.000
that it occurs as a doubling pair.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.000
Why is that the case?

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:17.000
We went back and looked at where these particular texts were found,

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:19.000
and it turns out that they were found

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:21.000
very, very far away from the Indus Valley.

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:24.000
They were found in present day Iraq and Iran.

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:26.000
And why were they found there?

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.000
What I haven't told you is that

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.000
the Indus people were very, very enterprising.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:33.000
They used to trade with people pretty far away from where they lived,

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:36.000
and so in this case, they were traveling by sea

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:39.000
all the way to Mesopotamia, present-day Iraq.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:41.000
And what seems to have happened here

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:44.000
is that the Indus traders, the merchants,

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:47.000
were using this script to write a foreign language.

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:49.000
It's just like our English and Dutch example.

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:51.000
And that would explain why we have these strange patterns

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:54.000
that are very different from the kinds of patterns you see in the text

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:57.000
that are found within the Indus Valley.

00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:59.000
This suggests that the same script, the Indus script,

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:02.000
could be used to write different languages.

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:05.000
The results we have so far seem to point to the conclusion

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:08.000
that the Indus script probably does represent language.

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:10.000
If it does represent language,

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.000
then how do we read the symbols?

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.000
That's our next big challenge.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.000
So you'll notice that many of the symbols

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.000
look like pictures of humans, of insects,

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:21.000
of fishes, of birds.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.000
Most ancient scripts

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:25.000
use the rebus principle,

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:28.000
which is, using pictures to represent words.

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:31.000
So as an example, here's a word.

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.000
Can you write it using pictures?

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:35.000
I'll give you a couple seconds.

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:37.000
Got it?

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:39.000
Okay. Great.

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:41.000
Here's my solution.

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:43.000
You could use the picture of a bee followed by a picture of a leaf --

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:45.000
and that's "belief," right.

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.000
There could be other solutions.

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:49.000
In the case of the Indus script,

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:51.000
the problem is the reverse.

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:54.000
You have to figure out the sounds of each of these pictures

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.000
such that the entire sequence makes sense.

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:59.000
So this is just like a crossword puzzle,

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:02.000
except that this is the mother of all crossword puzzles

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:06.000
because the stakes are so high if you solve it.

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:09.000
My colleagues, Iravatham Mahadevan and Asko Parpola,

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:11.000
have been making some headway on this particular problem.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:13.000
And I'd like to give you a quick example of Parpola's work.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:15.000
Here's a really short text.

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:18.000
It contains seven vertical strokes followed by this fish-like sign.

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:20.000
And I want to mention that these seals were used

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:22.000
for stamping clay tags

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:24.000
that were attached to bundles of goods,

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:27.000
so it's quite likely that these tags, at least some of them,

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:29.000
contain names of merchants.

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:31.000
And it turns out that in India

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:33.000
there's a long tradition

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:35.000
of names being based on horoscopes

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:38.000
and star constellations present at the time of birth.

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:40.000
In Dravidian languages,

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.000
the word for fish is "meen"

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:45.000
which happens to sound just like the word for star.

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:47.000
And so seven stars

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:49.000
would stand for "elu meen,"

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:51.000
which is the Dravidian word

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:53.000
for the Big Dipper star constellation.

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:56.000
Similarly, there's another sequence of six stars,

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:58.000
and that translates to "aru meen,"

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:00.000
which is the old Dravidian name

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.000
for the star constellation Pleiades.

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:05.000
And finally, there's other combinations,

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:08.000
such as this fish sign with something that looks like a roof on top of it.

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:11.000
And that could be translated into "mey meen,"

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:14.000
which is the old Dravidian name for the planet Saturn.

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:16.000
So that was pretty exciting.

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:18.000
It looks like we're getting somewhere.

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.000
But does this prove

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:22.000
that these seals contain Dravidian names

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:24.000
based on planets and star constellations?

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:26.000
Well not yet.

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:28.000
So we have no way of validating

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:30.000
these particular readings,

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:33.000
but if more and more of these readings start making sense,

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:35.000
and if longer and longer sequences

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:37.000
appear to be correct,

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:39.000
then we know that we are on the right track.

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:41.000
Today,

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:44.000
we can write a word such as TED

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:47.000
in Egyptian hieroglyphics and in cuneiform script,

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:49.000
because both of these were deciphered

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:51.000
in the 19th century.

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:53.000
The decipherment of these two scripts

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:56.000
enabled these civilizations to speak to us again directly.

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:58.000
The Mayans

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:00.000
started speaking to us in the 20th century,

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:03.000
but the Indus civilization remains silent.

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:05.000
Why should we care?

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:07.000
The Indus civilization does not belong

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:09.000
to just the South Indians or the North Indians

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:11.000
or the Pakistanis;

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:13.000
it belongs to all of us.

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:15.000
These are our ancestors --

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:17.000
yours and mine.

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:19.000
They were silenced

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:21.000
by an unfortunate accident of history.

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:23.000
If we decipher the script,

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:25.000
we would enable them to speak to us again.

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:28.000
What would they tell us?

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:31.000
What would we find out about them? About us?

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:34.000
I can't wait to find out.

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:36.000
Thank you.

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:40.000
(Applause)
