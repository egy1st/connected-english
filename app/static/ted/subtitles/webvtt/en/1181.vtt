WEBVTT

00:00:01.055 --> 00:00:02.206
It's an amazing thing

00:00:02.230 --> 00:00:06.212
that we're here to talk
about the year of patients rising.

00:00:07.006 --> 00:00:08.726
You heard stories earlier today

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:11.778
about patients who are taking
control of their cases,

00:00:11.802 --> 00:00:12.957
patients who are saying,

00:00:12.981 --> 00:00:14.955
"You know what, I know what the odds are,

00:00:14.979 --> 00:00:17.129
but I'm going to look
for more information.

00:00:17.153 --> 00:00:20.913
I'm going to define
what the terms of my success are."

00:00:20.937 --> 00:00:24.726
I'm going to be sharing with you
how, four years ago, I almost died --

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:27.633
found out I was, in fact,
already almost dead --

00:00:27.657 --> 00:00:29.895
and what I then found out

00:00:29.919 --> 00:00:32.121
about what's called
the e-Patient movement.

00:00:32.145 --> 00:00:33.794
I'll explain what that term means.

00:00:33.818 --> 00:00:36.586
I had been blogging
under the name "Patient Dave,"

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:37.984
and when I discovered this,

00:00:38.008 --> 00:00:40.306
I just renamed myself e-Patient Dave.

00:00:40.679 --> 00:00:42.382
Regarding the word "patient":

00:00:42.406 --> 00:00:46.342
When I first started a few years ago
getting involved in health care

00:00:46.366 --> 00:00:48.726
and attending meetings
as just a casual observer,

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.989
I noticed that people
would talk about patients

00:00:51.013 --> 00:00:53.588
as if it was somebody
who's not in the room here --

00:00:53.612 --> 00:00:55.006
somebody out there.

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:57.543
Some of our talks today,
we still act like that.

00:00:57.567 --> 00:00:59.479
But I'm here to tell you:

00:00:59.503 --> 00:01:02.225
"patient" is not a third-person word.

00:01:02.885 --> 00:01:04.048
All right?

00:01:04.072 --> 00:01:07.292
You yourself will find
yourself in a hospital bed --

00:01:07.316 --> 00:01:08.971
or your mother, your child --

00:01:08.995 --> 00:01:10.913
there are heads nodding, people who say,

00:01:10.937 --> 00:01:12.678
"Yes, I know exactly what you mean."

00:01:12.702 --> 00:01:15.726
So when you hear what I'm going
to talk about here today,

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.780
first of all, I want to say that I am here

00:01:18.804 --> 00:01:21.384
on behalf of all the patients
that I have ever met,

00:01:21.408 --> 00:01:23.111
all the ones I haven't met.

00:01:23.135 --> 00:01:26.908
This is about letting patients
play a more active role

00:01:26.932 --> 00:01:29.909
in helping health care,
in fixing health care.

00:01:29.933 --> 00:01:31.932
One of the senior doctors at my hospital,

00:01:31.956 --> 00:01:34.530
Charlie Safran,
and his colleague, Warner Slack,

00:01:34.554 --> 00:01:36.072
have been saying for decades

00:01:36.096 --> 00:01:39.856
that the most underutilized
resource in all of health care

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:41.055
is the patient.

00:01:41.599 --> 00:01:44.265
They have been saying that
since the 1970s.

00:01:44.289 --> 00:01:46.245
Now, I'm going to step back in history.

00:01:46.269 --> 00:01:48.155
This is from July, 1969.

00:01:48.179 --> 00:01:49.841
I was a freshman in college,

00:01:49.865 --> 00:01:52.468
and this was when we first
landed on the Moon.

00:01:52.853 --> 00:01:54.284
And it was the first time

00:01:54.308 --> 00:01:57.071
we had ever seen from another surface --

00:01:57.095 --> 00:01:59.339
that's the place
where you and I are right now,

00:01:59.363 --> 00:02:00.521
where we live.

00:02:00.545 --> 00:02:02.092
The world was changing.

00:02:02.116 --> 00:02:05.093
It was about to change
in ways that nobody could foresee.

00:02:05.117 --> 00:02:08.775
A few weeks later, Woodstock happened.

00:02:09.385 --> 00:02:11.465
Three days of fun and music.

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:13.589
Here, just for historical authenticity,

00:02:13.613 --> 00:02:15.412
is a picture of me in that year.

00:02:15.436 --> 00:02:18.662
(Laughter)

00:02:18.686 --> 00:02:20.663
Yeah, the wavy hair, the blue eyes --

00:02:20.687 --> 00:02:21.900
it was really something.

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:24.327
That fall of 1969,

00:02:24.351 --> 00:02:26.238
the Whole Earth Catalog came out.

00:02:26.262 --> 00:02:29.726
It was a hippie journal
of self-sufficiency.

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:32.781
We think of hippies
of being just hedonists,

00:02:32.805 --> 00:02:36.006
but there's a very strong component --
I was in that movement --

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:39.374
a very strong component
of being responsible for yourself.

00:02:39.398 --> 00:02:43.295
This book's title's subtitle
is "Access to Tools."

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:45.615
It talked about how to build
your own house,

00:02:45.639 --> 00:02:48.044
how to grow your own food,
all kinds of things.

00:02:48.068 --> 00:02:49.472
In the 1980s,

00:02:49.496 --> 00:02:51.630
this young doctor, Tom Ferguson,

00:02:51.654 --> 00:02:54.281
was the medical editor
of the Whole Earth Catalog.

00:02:54.305 --> 00:02:59.076
He saw that the great majority
of what we do in medicine and health care

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:00.575
is taking care of ourselves.

00:03:01.011 --> 00:03:03.362
In fact, he said it was 70 to 80 percent

00:03:03.386 --> 00:03:05.655
of how we actually
take care of our bodies.

00:03:05.679 --> 00:03:10.357
Well, he also saw that when health care
turns to medical care

00:03:10.381 --> 00:03:12.291
because of a more serious disease,

00:03:12.315 --> 00:03:15.639
the key thing that holds us back
is access to information.

00:03:15.663 --> 00:03:18.929
And when the Web came along,
that changed everything,

00:03:18.953 --> 00:03:21.546
because not only
could we find information,

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:24.286
we could find other people like ourselves

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:26.901
who could gather,
who could bring us information.

00:03:26.925 --> 00:03:29.440
And he coined this term "e-Patients" --

00:03:29.464 --> 00:03:31.795
equipped, engaged, empowered, enabled.

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:33.520
Obviously, at this stage of life

00:03:33.544 --> 00:03:37.511
he was in a somewhat more dignified
form than he was back then.

00:03:37.535 --> 00:03:41.489
Now, I was an engaged patient
long before I ever heard of the term.

00:03:41.513 --> 00:03:44.489
In 2006, I went to my doctor
for a regular physical,

00:03:44.513 --> 00:03:46.812
and I had said, "I have a sore shoulder."

00:03:46.836 --> 00:03:48.409
Well, I got an X-ray,

00:03:48.433 --> 00:03:50.081
and the next morning --

00:03:50.105 --> 00:03:53.630
you may have noticed, those of you
who have been through a medical crisis

00:03:53.654 --> 00:03:54.854
will understand this.

00:03:54.878 --> 00:03:59.340
This morning, some of the speakers
named the date when they found out

00:03:59.364 --> 00:04:00.635
about their condition.

00:04:00.659 --> 00:04:03.072
For me, it was 9am

00:04:03.096 --> 00:04:05.800
on January 3, 2007.

00:04:05.824 --> 00:04:08.319
I was at the office; my desk was clean.

00:04:08.343 --> 00:04:11.650
I had the blue partition
carpet on the walls.

00:04:12.087 --> 00:04:14.137
The phone rang and it was my doctor.

00:04:14.907 --> 00:04:17.726
He said, "Dave, I pulled
up the X-ray image

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:19.840
on the screen on the computer at home."

00:04:19.864 --> 00:04:21.931
He said, "Your shoulder
is going to be fine,

00:04:21.955 --> 00:04:24.040
but Dave, there's something in your lung."

00:04:24.064 --> 00:04:25.972
And if you look in that red oval,

00:04:25.996 --> 00:04:28.799
that shadow was not supposed to be there.

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:31.726
To make a long story short,

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:33.905
I said, "So you need me
to get back in there?"

00:04:33.929 --> 00:04:37.180
He said, "Yeah, we're going to need
to do a CT scan of your chest."

00:04:37.204 --> 00:04:39.845
In parting, I said,
"Is there anything I should do?"

00:04:39.869 --> 00:04:41.726
He said -- think about this one,

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:43.726
this is the advice your doctor gives you:

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:46.750
"Just go home and have a glass
of wine with your wife."

00:04:49.023 --> 00:04:50.849
I went in for the CAT scan.

00:04:52.218 --> 00:04:55.445
It turns out there were
five of these things in both my lungs.

00:04:55.469 --> 00:04:57.631
So at that point we knew
that it was cancer.

00:04:57.655 --> 00:04:59.259
We knew it wasn't lung cancer.

00:04:59.718 --> 00:05:02.235
That meant it was metastasized
from somewhere.

00:05:03.128 --> 00:05:04.791
The question was, where from?

00:05:05.234 --> 00:05:07.860
So I went in for an ultrasound.

00:05:07.884 --> 00:05:10.377
I got to do what many women have --

00:05:10.401 --> 00:05:13.256
the jelly on the belly and the, "Bzzzz!"

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:15.388
My wife came with me.

00:05:15.935 --> 00:05:17.540
She's a veterinarian,

00:05:17.564 --> 00:05:19.361
so she's seen lots of ultrasounds.

00:05:19.385 --> 00:05:20.969
I mean, she knows I'm not a dog.

00:05:20.993 --> 00:05:22.637
(Laughter)

00:05:22.661 --> 00:05:25.638
This is an MRI image.

00:05:25.662 --> 00:05:28.084
This is much sharper
than an ultrasound would be.

00:05:28.108 --> 00:05:30.009
What we saw in that kidney

00:05:30.882 --> 00:05:32.393
was that big blob there.

00:05:32.417 --> 00:05:35.457
There were actually two of these:
one was growing out the front

00:05:35.481 --> 00:05:37.904
and had already erupted
and latched onto the bowel.

00:05:37.928 --> 00:05:41.147
One was growing out the back
and it attached to the psoas muscle,

00:05:41.171 --> 00:05:43.956
which is a big muscle in the back
that I'd never heard of,

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:45.813
but all of a sudden I cared about it.

00:05:45.837 --> 00:05:46.836
(Laughter)

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:48.023
I went home.

00:05:48.047 --> 00:05:49.321
Now, I've been Googling --

00:05:49.345 --> 00:05:51.735
I've been online since 1989,
on CompuServe.

00:05:51.759 --> 00:05:54.389
I went home, and I know
you can't read the details here;

00:05:54.413 --> 00:05:55.579
that's not important.

00:05:55.603 --> 00:05:59.807
My point is, I went to a respected
medical website, WebMD,

00:05:59.831 --> 00:06:02.089
because I know how to filter out junk.

00:06:02.113 --> 00:06:04.089
I also found my wife online.

00:06:04.638 --> 00:06:06.320
Before I met her,

00:06:06.344 --> 00:06:08.820
I went through some suboptimal
search results.

00:06:08.844 --> 00:06:10.392
(Laughter)

00:06:10.416 --> 00:06:13.570
So I looked for quality information.

00:06:13.594 --> 00:06:15.326
There's so much about trust --

00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:17.853
what sources of information can we trust?

00:06:17.877 --> 00:06:22.641
Where does my body end
and an invader start?

00:06:22.665 --> 00:06:25.803
A cancer, a tumor, is something
you grow out of your own tissue.

00:06:25.827 --> 00:06:27.392
How does that happen?

00:06:27.416 --> 00:06:31.435
Where does medical ability end and start?

00:06:31.459 --> 00:06:33.344
Well, so what I read on WebMD:

00:06:33.915 --> 00:06:38.901
"The prognosis is poor
for progressing renal cell cancer.

00:06:38.925 --> 00:06:41.139
Almost all patients are incurable."

00:06:42.307 --> 00:06:46.022
I've been online long enough to know
if I don't like the first results I get,

00:06:46.046 --> 00:06:47.199
I go look for more.

00:06:47.223 --> 00:06:49.885
And what I found on other websites was,

00:06:49.909 --> 00:06:52.273
even by the third page of Google results:

00:06:52.297 --> 00:06:53.731
"Outlook is bleak."

00:06:54.352 --> 00:06:56.328
"Prognosis is grim."

00:06:56.939 --> 00:06:59.035
And I'm thinking, "What the heck?"

00:06:59.059 --> 00:07:00.791
I didn't feel sick at all.

00:07:00.815 --> 00:07:03.005
I mean, I'd been getting
tired in the evening,

00:07:03.029 --> 00:07:05.045
but I was 56 years old, you know?

00:07:05.069 --> 00:07:06.726
I was slowly losing weight,

00:07:06.750 --> 00:07:10.640
but for me, that was what
the doctor told me to do.

00:07:10.998 --> 00:07:12.670
It was really something.

00:07:12.694 --> 00:07:15.874
And this is the diagram
of stage 4 kidney cancer

00:07:15.898 --> 00:07:17.655
from the drug I eventually got.

00:07:17.679 --> 00:07:20.245
Totally by coincidence,
there's that thing in my lung.

00:07:20.749 --> 00:07:23.726
In the left femur, the left thigh bone,
there's another one.

00:07:23.750 --> 00:07:26.115
I had one. My leg eventually snapped.

00:07:26.139 --> 00:07:29.061
I fainted and landed on it, and it broke.

00:07:29.085 --> 00:07:30.333
There's one in the skull,

00:07:30.357 --> 00:07:32.820
and then for good measure,
I had these other tumors,

00:07:32.844 --> 00:07:34.915
including, by the time
my treatment started,

00:07:34.939 --> 00:07:36.528
one was growing out of my tongue.

00:07:36.552 --> 00:07:38.696
I had kidney cancer
growing out of my tongue.

00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:39.879
And what I read

00:07:39.903 --> 00:07:42.291
was that my median survival was 24 weeks.

00:07:43.164 --> 00:07:44.619
This was bad.

00:07:44.643 --> 00:07:46.439
I was facing the grave.

00:07:47.043 --> 00:07:49.617
I thought, "What's my mother's face
going to look like

00:07:49.641 --> 00:07:50.951
on the day of my funeral?"

00:07:51.345 --> 00:07:56.830
I had to sit down with my daughter
and say, "Here's the situation."

00:07:56.854 --> 00:07:58.268
Her boyfriend was with her.

00:07:58.292 --> 00:08:01.093
I said, "I don't want you guys
to get married prematurely,

00:08:01.117 --> 00:08:03.899
just so you can do it
while Dad's still alive."

00:08:05.079 --> 00:08:06.648
It's really serious.

00:08:06.672 --> 00:08:10.252
If you wonder why patients
are motivated and want to help,

00:08:10.276 --> 00:08:11.434
think about this.

00:08:11.458 --> 00:08:15.488
Well, my doctor prescribed
a patient community, ACOR.org,

00:08:15.512 --> 00:08:18.726
a network of cancer patients,
of all amazing things.

00:08:18.750 --> 00:08:20.726
Very quickly they told me,

00:08:20.750 --> 00:08:22.726
"Kidney cancer is an uncommon disease.

00:08:22.750 --> 00:08:24.727
Get yourself to a specialist center.

00:08:24.751 --> 00:08:27.750
There is no cure, but there's something
that sometimes works --

00:08:27.774 --> 00:08:29.330
it usually doesn't --

00:08:29.354 --> 00:08:31.168
called high-dosage interleukin.

00:08:31.192 --> 00:08:33.200
Most hospitals don't offer it,

00:08:33.224 --> 00:08:35.399
so they won't even tell you it exists.

00:08:35.423 --> 00:08:37.542
Don't let them give you
anything else first.

00:08:37.566 --> 00:08:40.939
And by the way, here are four doctors
in your part of the United States

00:08:40.963 --> 00:08:42.914
who offer it, and their phone numbers."

00:08:42.938 --> 00:08:45.376
How amazing is that?

00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:48.214
(Applause)

00:08:48.238 --> 00:08:49.434
Here's the thing:

00:08:49.458 --> 00:08:51.046
Here we are, four years later --

00:08:51.070 --> 00:08:54.646
you can't find a website
that gives patients that information.

00:08:54.670 --> 00:08:57.203
Government-approved,
American Cancer Society,

00:08:57.227 --> 00:09:00.203
but patients know
what patients want to know.

00:09:00.834 --> 00:09:03.605
It's the power of patient networks.

00:09:03.629 --> 00:09:06.858
This amazing substance --
again, I mentioned:

00:09:06.882 --> 00:09:08.236
Where does my body end?

00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:10.654
My oncologist and I talk a lot these days

00:09:10.678 --> 00:09:13.179
because I try to keep my talks
technically accurate.

00:09:13.203 --> 00:09:17.531
And he said, "You know, the immune
system is good at detecting invaders,

00:09:18.277 --> 00:09:20.594
bacteria coming from outside,

00:09:20.618 --> 00:09:23.092
but when it's your own tissue
that you've grown,

00:09:23.116 --> 00:09:24.635
it's a whole different thing."

00:09:24.659 --> 00:09:27.615
And I went through
a mental exercise, actually,

00:09:27.639 --> 00:09:32.457
because I started a patient support
community of my own on a website,

00:09:32.481 --> 00:09:35.515
and one of my friends --
one of my relatives, actually -- said,

00:09:35.539 --> 00:09:37.289
"Look, Dave, who grew this thing?

00:09:38.894 --> 00:09:42.917
Are you going to set yourself up
as mentally attacking yourself?"

00:09:42.941 --> 00:09:44.545
So we went into it.

00:09:44.569 --> 00:09:47.286
The story of how all that
happened is in the book.

00:09:47.310 --> 00:09:49.734
Anyway, this is the way
the numbers unfolded.

00:09:49.758 --> 00:09:52.889
Me being me, I put the numbers
from my hospital's website,

00:09:52.913 --> 00:09:54.072
for my tumor sizes,

00:09:54.096 --> 00:09:55.247
into a spreadsheet.

00:09:55.271 --> 00:09:56.726
Don't worry about the numbers.

00:09:56.750 --> 00:09:58.502
You see, that's the immune system.

00:09:58.526 --> 00:10:00.503
Amazing thing, those two yellow lines

00:10:00.527 --> 00:10:04.726
are where I got the two doses
of interleukin two months apart.

00:10:04.750 --> 00:10:07.880
And look at how the tumor sizes
plummeted in between.

00:10:07.904 --> 00:10:09.363
Just incredible.

00:10:09.387 --> 00:10:12.817
Who knows what we'll be able to do
when we learn to make more use of it?

00:10:12.841 --> 00:10:15.157
The punch line is that a year
and a half later,

00:10:15.181 --> 00:10:19.481
I was there when this magnificent
young woman, my daughter,

00:10:19.505 --> 00:10:20.668
got married.

00:10:20.692 --> 00:10:22.503
And when she came down those steps,

00:10:23.091 --> 00:10:25.321
and it was just her and me
for that moment,

00:10:25.345 --> 00:10:28.567
I was so glad that she didn't have
to say to her mother,

00:10:28.591 --> 00:10:30.647
"I wish Dad could have been here."

00:10:30.671 --> 00:10:34.551
And this is what we're doing
when we make health care better.

00:10:34.575 --> 00:10:37.478
Now, I want to talk briefly
about a couple of other patients

00:10:37.502 --> 00:10:40.511
who are doing everything
in their power to improve health care.

00:10:40.535 --> 00:10:42.174
This is Regina Holliday,

00:10:42.198 --> 00:10:46.397
a painter in Washington DC,
whose husband died of kidney cancer

00:10:46.421 --> 00:10:47.921
a year after my disease.

00:10:47.945 --> 00:10:49.726
She's painting, here, a mural

00:10:49.750 --> 00:10:52.726
of his horrible
final weeks in the hospital.

00:10:52.750 --> 00:10:55.197
One of the things that she discovered

00:10:55.221 --> 00:10:59.505
was that her husband's medical record
in this paper folder

00:10:59.529 --> 00:11:01.055
was just disorganized.

00:11:01.079 --> 00:11:04.344
And she thought, "You know,
if I have a nutrition facts label

00:11:04.368 --> 00:11:06.091
on the side of a cereal box,

00:11:06.115 --> 00:11:08.070
why can't there be something that simple

00:11:08.094 --> 00:11:10.638
telling every new nurse who comes on duty,

00:11:10.662 --> 00:11:11.887
every new doctor,

00:11:11.911 --> 00:11:14.021
the basics about my husband's condition?"

00:11:14.045 --> 00:11:19.321
So she painted this medical facts mural
with a nutrition label,

00:11:19.345 --> 00:11:20.502
something like that,

00:11:20.526 --> 00:11:21.726
in a diagram of him.

00:11:21.750 --> 00:11:24.726
She then, last year, painted this diagram.

00:11:24.750 --> 00:11:26.634
She studied health care like me.

00:11:26.658 --> 00:11:29.094
She came to realize
there were a lot of people

00:11:29.118 --> 00:11:31.128
who'd written patient-advocate books

00:11:31.152 --> 00:11:33.995
that you just don't hear
about at medical conferences.

00:11:34.019 --> 00:11:36.774
Patients are such
an underutilized resource.

00:11:37.679 --> 00:11:39.404
Well, as it said in my introduction,

00:11:39.428 --> 00:11:41.210
I've gotten somewhat known for saying

00:11:41.234 --> 00:11:43.441
that patients should have
access to their data.

00:11:43.465 --> 00:11:46.141
I actually said at one conference
a couple of years ago,

00:11:46.165 --> 00:11:47.328
"Give me my damn data,

00:11:47.352 --> 00:11:49.955
because you people
can't be trusted to keep it clean."

00:11:49.979 --> 00:11:52.726
And here, she has our "damned" data --

00:11:52.750 --> 00:11:54.044
it's a pun --

00:11:54.068 --> 00:11:56.996
which is starting to break out,
starting to break through --

00:11:57.020 --> 00:11:59.116
the water symbolizes our data.

00:11:59.140 --> 00:12:00.291
And in fact,

00:12:00.315 --> 00:12:03.019
I want to do a little something
improvisational for you.

00:12:03.043 --> 00:12:06.912
There's a guy on Twitter that I know,
a health IT guy outside Boston,

00:12:06.936 --> 00:12:09.468
and he wrote the e-Patient rap.

00:12:09.492 --> 00:12:11.190
And it goes like this.

00:12:11.214 --> 00:12:12.832
(Laughter)

00:12:12.856 --> 00:12:16.916
(Beatboxing)

00:12:16.940 --> 00:12:18.965
(Rapping) Gimme my damn data

00:12:18.989 --> 00:12:21.457
I wanna be an e-Patient just like Dave

00:12:21.481 --> 00:12:24.017
Gimme my damn data,
'cause it's my life to save

00:12:24.041 --> 00:12:26.619
(Normal voice) Now, I'm not going
to go any further --

00:12:26.643 --> 00:12:33.174
(Applause) (Cheering)

00:12:41.005 --> 00:12:43.410
Well, thank you. That shot the timing.

00:12:43.434 --> 00:12:45.075
(Laughter)

00:12:45.099 --> 00:12:46.570
Think about the possibility.

00:12:46.594 --> 00:12:50.980
Why is it that iPhones and iPads
advance far faster

00:12:51.004 --> 00:12:53.244
than the health tools
that are available to you

00:12:53.268 --> 00:12:55.496
to help take care of your family?

00:12:55.520 --> 00:12:59.640
Here's a website, VisibleBody.com,
that I stumbled across.

00:12:59.664 --> 00:13:02.598
And I thought, "You know,
I wonder what my psoas muscle is?"

00:13:02.622 --> 00:13:04.599
So you can click on things and remove it.

00:13:04.623 --> 00:13:07.600
And I saw, "Aha! That's the kidney
and the psoas muscle."

00:13:07.624 --> 00:13:11.585
I was rotating it in 3D
and saying, "I understand now."

00:13:11.609 --> 00:13:14.544
And then I realized
it reminded me of Google Earth,

00:13:14.568 --> 00:13:16.881
where you can fly to any address.

00:13:17.345 --> 00:13:22.673
And I thought, "Why not take this
and connect it to my digital scan data

00:13:22.697 --> 00:13:24.981
and have Google Earth for my body?"

00:13:25.606 --> 00:13:27.726
What did Google come out with this year?

00:13:27.750 --> 00:13:29.754
Now there's Google Body browser.

00:13:30.358 --> 00:13:32.335
But you see, it's still generic.

00:13:32.359 --> 00:13:34.239
It's not my data.

00:13:34.263 --> 00:13:37.337
But if we can get that data
out from behind the dam

00:13:37.361 --> 00:13:40.338
so software innovators can pounce on it

00:13:40.362 --> 00:13:42.638
the way software innovators like to do,

00:13:42.662 --> 00:13:44.848
who knows what we'll be able
to come up with.

00:13:44.872 --> 00:13:46.023
One final story.

00:13:46.047 --> 00:13:50.622
This is Kelly Young, a rheumatoid
arthritis patient from Florida.

00:13:50.998 --> 00:13:54.517
This is a live story,
unfolding just in the last few weeks.

00:13:54.541 --> 00:14:00.085
RA patients, as they call themselves --
her blog is "RA Warrior" --

00:14:00.109 --> 00:14:01.466
have a big problem,

00:14:01.490 --> 00:14:04.268
because 40 percent of them
have no visible symptoms.

00:14:04.750 --> 00:14:07.808
And that makes it really hard
to tell how the disease is going,

00:14:07.832 --> 00:14:10.989
and some doctors think,
"Yeah right, you're really in pain."

00:14:11.013 --> 00:14:13.726
Well, she found,
through her online research,

00:14:13.750 --> 00:14:17.138
a nuclear bone scan
that's usually used for cancer,

00:14:17.162 --> 00:14:19.951
but it can also reveal inflammation.

00:14:19.975 --> 00:14:23.885
And she saw that
if there is no inflammation,

00:14:23.909 --> 00:14:26.369
then the scan is a uniform gray.

00:14:26.393 --> 00:14:27.588
So she took it.

00:14:27.612 --> 00:14:31.893
And the radiologist's report
said, "No cancer found."

00:14:31.917 --> 00:14:34.396
Well, that's not what
he was supposed to do with it.

00:14:34.420 --> 00:14:36.841
So she wanted to have it read again,

00:14:36.865 --> 00:14:38.726
and her doctor fired her.

00:14:38.750 --> 00:14:40.633
She pulled up the CD.

00:14:40.657 --> 00:14:44.364
He said, "If you don't want to follow
my instructions, go away."

00:14:44.959 --> 00:14:47.726
So she pulled up the CD
of the scan images,

00:14:47.750 --> 00:14:49.726
and look at all those hot spots.

00:14:49.750 --> 00:14:52.726
And she's now actively engaged on her blog

00:14:52.750 --> 00:14:55.545
in looking for assistance
in getting better care.

00:14:56.060 --> 00:14:58.852
See, that is an empowered
patient -- no medical training.

00:14:58.876 --> 00:15:00.847
We are, you are,

00:15:00.871 --> 00:15:03.566
the most underused
resource in health care.

00:15:03.590 --> 00:15:05.106
What she was able to do

00:15:05.130 --> 00:15:07.872
was because she had access
to the raw data.

00:15:07.896 --> 00:15:09.268
How big a deal was this?

00:15:09.292 --> 00:15:11.038
Well at TED2009,

00:15:11.062 --> 00:15:14.336
Tim Berners-Lee himself,
inventor of the Web,

00:15:14.360 --> 00:15:17.337
gave a talk where he said
the next big thing

00:15:17.361 --> 00:15:22.036
is not to have your browser find
other people's articles about the data,

00:15:22.060 --> 00:15:23.242
but the raw data.

00:15:23.266 --> 00:15:26.036
And he got them chanting
by the end of the talk,

00:15:26.060 --> 00:15:29.727
"Raw data now! Raw data now!"

00:15:29.751 --> 00:15:31.265
And I ask you,

00:15:31.289 --> 00:15:34.005
three words, please,
to improve health care:

00:15:34.567 --> 00:15:36.544
Let patients help!

00:15:36.568 --> 00:15:38.282
Let patients help!

00:15:38.306 --> 00:15:40.161
Let patients help!

00:15:40.185 --> 00:15:42.103
Let patients help!

00:15:42.127 --> 00:15:43.391
Thank you.

00:15:43.415 --> 00:15:50.183
(Applause)

00:16:00.162 --> 00:16:05.548
For all the patients around the world
watching this on the Webcast,

00:16:05.572 --> 00:16:07.893
God bless you, everyone.
Let patients help.

00:16:07.917 --> 00:16:10.555
Host: And bless yourself.
Thank you very much.
