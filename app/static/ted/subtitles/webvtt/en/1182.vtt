00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
The Highline

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
is an old, elevated rail line

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
that runs for a mile and a half right through Manhattan.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
And it was originally a freight line

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
that ran down 10th Ave.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
And it became known as "Death Avenue"

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
because so many people were run over by the trains

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
that the railroad hired a guy on horseback to run in front,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
and he became known as the "West Side Cowboy."

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
But even with a cowboy,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
about one person a month

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
was killed and run over.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
So they elevated it.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
They built it 30 ft. in the air, right through the middle of the city.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
But with the rise of interstate trucking,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
it was used less and less.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
And by 1980, the last train rode.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
It was a train loaded with frozen turkeys -- they say, at Thanksgiving --

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
from the meatpacking district.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
And then it was abandoned.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
And I live in the neighborhood,

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
and I first read about it in the New York Times,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
in an article that said it was going to be demolished.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
And I assumed someone was working

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
to preserve it or save it

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
and I could volunteer,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
but I realized no one was doing anything.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
I went to my first community board meeting --

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
which I'd never been to one before --

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
and sat next to another guy named Joshua David,

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
who's a travel writer.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
And at the end of the meeting, we realized

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
we were the only two people that were sort of interested in the project;

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
most people wanted to tear it down.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
So we exchanged business cards,

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
and we kept calling each other

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
and decided to start this organization,

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
Friends of the High Line.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
And the goal at first

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
was just saving it from demolition,

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
but then we also wanted to figure out what we could do with it.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
And what first attracted me, or interested me,

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
was this view from the street --

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
which is this steel structure,

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
sort of rusty,

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
this industrial relic.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
But when I went up on top,

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
it was a mile and a half of wildflowers

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
running right through the middle of Manhattan

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
with views of the Empire State Building

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
and the Statue of Liberty and the Hudson River.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
And that's really where we started,

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
the idea coalesced around, let's make this a park,

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
and let's have it be sort of inspired

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
by this wildscape.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
At the time, there was a lot of opposition.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
Mayor Giuliani wanted to tear it down.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
I'm going to fast-forward through a lot of lawsuits

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
and a lot of community engagement.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
Mayor Bloomberg came in office, he was very supportive,

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
but we still had to make the economic case.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
This was after 9/11;

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
the city was in tough times.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
So we commissioned an economic feasibility study

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
to try to make the case.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
And it turns out, we got those numbers wrong.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000
We thought it would cost 100 million dollars to build.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000
So far it's cost about 150 million.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
And the main case was,

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
this is going to make good economic sense for the city.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000
So we said over a 20-year time period,

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000
the value to the city in increased property values

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
and increased taxes

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
would be about 250 million.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
That was enough. It really got the city behind it.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
It turns out we were wrong on that.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000
Now people estimate it's created about a half a billion dollars,

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
or will create about a half a billion dollars,

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
in tax revenues for the city.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
We did a design competition,

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
selected a design team.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
We worked with them to really create a design

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000
that was inspired by that wildscape.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000
There's three sections.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
We opened the fist section in 2009.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000
It's been successful beyond our dreams.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
Last year we had about two million people,

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000
which is about 10 times what we ever estimated.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000
This is one of my favorite features in section one.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.000
It's this amphitheater right over 10th Ave.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.000
And the first section ends at 20th St. right now.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.000
The other thing, it's generated, obviously, a lot of economic value;

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.000
it's also inspired, I think, a lot of great architecture.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000
There's a point, you can stand here

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000
and see buildings by Frank Gehry,

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000
Jean Nouvel, Shigeru Ban,

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000
Neil Denari.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.000
And the Whitney is moving downtown

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.000
and is building their new museum right at the base of the High Line.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000
And this has been designed by Renzo Piano.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.000
And they're going to break ground in May.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000
And we've already started construction on section two.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000
This is one of my favorite features,

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000
this flyover where you're eight feet

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
off the surface of the High Line,

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
running through a canopy of trees.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.000
The High Line used to be covered in billboards,

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000
and so we've taken a playful take

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000
where, instead of framing advertisements,

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.000
it's going to frame people in views of the city.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.000
This was just installed last month.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.000
And then the last section was going to go around the rail yards,

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000
which is the largest undeveloped site

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000
in Manhattan.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000
And the city has planned -- for better or for worse --

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000
12 million square-feet of development

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
that the High Line is going to ring around.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
But what really, I think, makes the High Line special

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
is the people.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.000
And honestly, even though I love the designs that we were building,

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.000
I was always frightened that I wouldn't really love it,

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000
because I fell in love with that wildscape --

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000
and how could you recreate that magic?

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000
But what I found

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000
is it's in the people and how they use it

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000
that, to me, makes it so special.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000
Just one quick example

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
is I realized right after we opened

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.000
that there were all these people holding hands on the High Line.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.000
And I realized New Yorkers don't hold hands;

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.000
we just don't do that outside.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000
But you see that happening on the High Line,

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000
and I think that's the power

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000
that public space can have

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000
to transform how people experience their city

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000
and interact with each other.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000
Thanks.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:20.000
(Applause)
