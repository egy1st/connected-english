00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.976
A few years ago,
I felt like I was stuck in a rut,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:06.976
so I decided to follow in the footsteps

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.536
of the great American
philosopher, Morgan Spurlock,

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:12.976
and try something new for 30 days.

00:00:13.523 --> 00:00:15.276
The idea is actually pretty simple.

00:00:15.675 --> 00:00:18.676
Think about something you've always
wanted to add to your life

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:20.976
and try it for the next 30 days.

00:00:21.897 --> 00:00:25.291
It turns out 30 days is just
about the right amount of time

00:00:25.315 --> 00:00:28.007
to add a new habit or subtract a habit --

00:00:28.031 --> 00:00:29.276
like watching the news --

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:30.976
from your life.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.191
There's a few things I learned
while doing these 30-day challenges.

00:00:34.622 --> 00:00:35.976
The first was,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.976
instead of the months
flying by, forgotten,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.976
the time was much more memorable.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.572
This was part of a challenge I did
to take a picture every day for a month.

00:00:45.596 --> 00:00:50.021
And I remember exactly where I was
and what I was doing that day.

00:00:51.132 --> 00:00:52.409
I also noticed

00:00:52.433 --> 00:00:55.762
that as I started to do more
and harder 30-day challenges,

00:00:55.786 --> 00:00:56.976
my self-confidence grew.

00:00:57.579 --> 00:00:59.476
I went from desk-dwelling computer nerd

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:01.976
to the kind of guy who bikes to work.

00:01:02.597 --> 00:01:03.845
For fun!

00:01:03.869 --> 00:01:05.219
(Laughter)

00:01:05.243 --> 00:01:08.266
Even last year, I ended up hiking
up Mt. Kilimanjaro,

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:09.976
the highest mountain in Africa.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.023
I would never have been that adventurous
before I started my 30-day challenges.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.597
I also figured out that if you
really want something badly enough,

00:01:20.621 --> 00:01:22.976
you can do anything for 30 days.

00:01:24.105 --> 00:01:25.970
Have you ever wanted to write a novel?

00:01:26.959 --> 00:01:28.250
Every November,

00:01:28.274 --> 00:01:29.576
tens of thousands of people

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:33.681
try to write their own
50,000-word novel, from scratch,

00:01:33.705 --> 00:01:34.976
in 30 days.

00:01:35.663 --> 00:01:40.512
It turns out, all you have to do
is write 1,667 words a day

00:01:40.536 --> 00:01:41.739
for a month.

00:01:42.573 --> 00:01:43.976
So I did.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.861
By the way, the secret
is not to go to sleep

00:01:46.885 --> 00:01:48.982
until you've written
your words for the day.

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:50.976
You might be sleep-deprived,

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.698
but you'll finish your novel.

00:01:53.769 --> 00:01:56.976
Now is my book the next great
American novel?

00:01:57.447 --> 00:01:58.976
No. I wrote it in a month.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.836
It's awful.

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:02.502
(Laughter)

00:02:02.526 --> 00:02:04.711
But for the rest of my life,

00:02:04.735 --> 00:02:06.976
if I meet John Hodgman at a TED party,

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.976
I don't have to say,

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.976
"I'm a computer scientist."

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.339
No, no, if I want to,
I can say, "I'm a novelist."

00:02:14.363 --> 00:02:17.725
(Laughter)

00:02:17.749 --> 00:02:19.976
So here's one last thing
I'd like to mention.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.479
I learned that when I made
small, sustainable changes,

00:02:23.503 --> 00:02:24.976
things I could keep doing,

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.223
they were more likely to stick.

00:02:27.247 --> 00:02:29.976
There's nothing wrong
with big, crazy challenges.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.366
In fact, they're a ton of fun.

00:02:32.828 --> 00:02:34.430
But they're less likely to stick.

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:37.818
When I gave up sugar for 30 days,

00:02:37.842 --> 00:02:39.657
day 31 looked like this.

00:02:39.681 --> 00:02:41.985
(Laughter)

00:02:42.009 --> 00:02:44.450
So here's my question to you:

00:02:44.474 --> 00:02:46.209
What are you waiting for?

00:02:46.233 --> 00:02:48.511
I guarantee you the next 30 days

00:02:48.535 --> 00:02:52.135
are going to pass
whether you like it or not,

00:02:52.159 --> 00:02:56.858
so why not think about something
you have always wanted to try

00:02:56.882 --> 00:02:58.129
and give it a shot!

00:02:58.711 --> 00:03:00.060
For the next 30 days.

00:03:00.656 --> 00:03:01.976
Thanks.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.880
(Applause)
