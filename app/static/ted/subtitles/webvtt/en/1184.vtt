00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
So I'm going to tell you a little bit

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
about reimagining food.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
I've been interested in food for a long time.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
I taught myself to cook

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
with a bunch of big books like this.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
I went to chef school in France.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
And there is a way

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
the world both envisions food,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
the way the world writes about food and learns about food.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
And it's largely what you would find in these books.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
And it's a wonderful thing.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
But there's some things that have been going on

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
since this idea of food was established.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
In the last 20 years,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
people have realized that science

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
has a tremendous amount to do with food.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
In fact, understanding why cooking works

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
requires knowing the science of cooking --

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
some of the chemistry, some of the physics and so forth.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
But that's not in any of those books.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
There's also a tremendous number of techniques

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
that chefs have developed,

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
some about new aesthetics, new approaches to food.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
There's a chef in Spain named Ferran Adria.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
He's developed a very avant-garde cuisine.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
A guy in England called Heston Blumenthal,

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
he's developed his avant-garde cuisine.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
None of the techniques that these people have developed

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
over the course of the last 20 years

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
is in any of those books.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
None of them are taught in cooking schools.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
In order to learn them, you have to go work in those restaurants.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
And finally,

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
there's the old way of viewing food

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
is the old way.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
And so a few years ago -- fours years ago, actually --

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
I set out to say, is there a way

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.000
we can communicate science and technique and wonder?

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
Is there a way we can show people food

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
in a way they have not seen it before?

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
So we tried, and I'll show you what we came up with.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
This is a picture called a cutaway.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
This is actually the first picture I took in the book.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
The idea here is to explain what happens

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
when you steam broccoli.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
And this magic view allows you to see

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
all of what's happening

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
while the broccoli steams.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
Then each of the different little pieces around it

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
explain some fact.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
And the hope was two-fold.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
One is you can actually explain what happens when you steam broccoli.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
But the other thing is that maybe we could seduce people

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
into stuff that was a little more technical,

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
maybe a little bit more scientific, maybe a little bit more chef-y

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
than they otherwise would have.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
Because with that beautiful photo,

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
maybe I can also package this little box here

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
that talks about how steaming and boiling

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
actually take different amounts of time.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
Steaming ought to be faster.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000
It turns out it isn't because of something called film condensation,

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
and this explains that.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
Well, that first cutaway picture worked,

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
so we said, "Okay, let's do some more."

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
So here's another one.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000
We discovered why woks are the shape they are.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
This shaped wok doesn't work very well;

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
this caught fire three times.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
But we had a philosophy,

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000
which is it only has to look good for a thousandth of a second.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
(Laughter)

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
And one of our canning cutaways.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
Once you start cutting things in half, you kind of get carried away,

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
so you see we cut the jars in half as well as the pan.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
And each of these text blocks

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
explains a key thing that's going on.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000
In this case, boiling water canning

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000
is for canning things that are already pretty acidic.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000
You don't have to heat them up as hot

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000
as you would something you do pressure canning

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000
because bacterial spores can't grow in the acid.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
So this is great for pickled vegetables,

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
which is what we're canning here.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000
Here's our hamburger cutaway.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000
One of our philosophies in the book

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000
is that no dish

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
is really intrinsically any better than any other dish.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
So you can lavish

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.000
all the same care, all the same technique,

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
on a hamburger

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000
as you would on some much more fancy dish.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000
And if you do lavish as much technique as possible,

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000
and you try to make the highest quality hamburger,

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000
it gets to be a little bit involved.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000
The New York Times ran a piece

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000
after my book was delayed

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000
and it was called "The Wait for the 30-Hour Hamburger

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000
Just Got Longer."

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.000
Because our hamburger recipe, our ultimate hamburger recipe,

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.000
if you make the buns and you marinate the meat and you do all this stuff,

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000
it does take about 30 hours.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
Of course, you're not actually working the whole time.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
Most of the time is kind of sitting there.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000
The point of this cutaway

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000
is to show people a view of hamburgers they haven't seen before

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000
and to explain the physics of hamburgers

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000
and the chemistry of hamburgers,

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000
because, believe it or not, there is something to the physics and chemistry --

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000
in particular, those flames underneath the burger.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000
Most of the characteristic char-grilled taste

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.000
doesn't come from the wood or the charcoal.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000
Buying mesquite charcoal will not actually make that much difference.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000
Mostly it comes from fat pyrolyzing, or burning.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000
So it's the fat that drips down and flares up

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
that causes the characteristic taste.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000
Now you might wonder, how do we make these cutaways?

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000
Most people assume we use Photoshop.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000
And the answer is: no, not really;

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.000
we use a machine shop.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.000
And it turns out, the best way to cut things in half

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.000
is to actually cut them in half.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000
So we have two halves of one of the best kitchens in the world.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000
(Laughter)

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:55.000
We cut a $5,000 restaurant oven in half.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000
The manufacturer said,

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000
"What would it take for you to cut one in half?"

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000
I said, "It would have to show up free."

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000
And so it showed up, we used it a little while,

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000
we cut it in half.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.000
Now you can also see a little bit how we did some of these shots.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000
We would glue a piece of Pyrex

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.000
or heat-resistant glass in front.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.000
We used a red, very high-temperature silicon to do that.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000
The great thing is, when you cut something in half,

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000
you have another half.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000
So you photograph that in exactly the same position,

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000
and then you can substitute in --

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.000
and that part does use Photoshop -- just the edges.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000
So it's very much like in a Hollywood movie

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000
where a guy flies through the air, supported by wires,

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.000
and then they take the wires away digitally

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.000
so you're flying through the air.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000
In most cases, though, there was no glass.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.000
Like for the hamburger, we just cut the damn barbecue.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.000
And so those coals that kept falling off the edge,

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000
we kept having to put them back up.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000
But again, it only has to work for a thousandth of a second.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.000
The wok shot caught fire three times.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000
What happens when you have your wok cut in half

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.000
is the oil goes down into the fire

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000
and whoosh!

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000
One of our cooks lost his eyebrows that way.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000
But hey, they grow back.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000
In addition to cutaways,

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.000
we also explain physics.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.000
This is Fourier's law of heat conduction.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000
It's a partial differential equation.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000
We have the only cookbook in the world

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000
that has partial differential equations in it.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000
But to make them palatable,

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.000
we cut it out of a steel plate and put it in front of a fire

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.000
and photographed it like this.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.000
We've got lots of little tidbits in the book.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000
Everybody knows that your various appliances

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.000
have wattage, right?

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000
But you probably don't know that much about James Watt.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.000
But now you will; we put a biography of James Watt in.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000
It's a little couple paragraphs

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.000
to explain why we call that unit of heat the watt,

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000
and where he got his inspiration.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.000
It turned out he was hired by a Scottish distillery

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000
to understand why they were burning so damn much peat

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.000
to distill the whiskey.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.000
We also did a lot of calculation.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.000
I personally wrote thousands of lines of code

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.000
to write this cookbook.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000
Here's a calculation

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000
that shows how the intensity of a barbecue,

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.000
or other radiant heat source, goes

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000
as you move away from it.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000
So as you move vertically away from this surface,

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000
the heat falls off.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.000
As you move side to side, it moves off.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.000
That horn-shaped region

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.000
is what we call the sweet spot.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.000
That's the place where the heat is even to within 10 percent.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000
So that's the place where you really want to cook.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.000
And it's got this funny horn-shaped thing,

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.000
which as far as I know, again,

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.000
the first cookbook to ever do this.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.000
Now it may also be the last cookbook that ever does it.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.000
You know, there's two ways

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.000
you can make a product.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000
You can do lots of market research

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000
and do focus groups

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.000
and figure out what people really want,

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000
or you can just kind of go for it

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.000
and make the book you want and hope other people like it.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.000
Here's a step-by-step that shows grinding hamburger.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.000
If you really want great hamburger,

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:47.000
it turns out it makes a difference if you align the grain.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.000
And it's really simple, as you can see here.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.000
As it comes out of the grinder, you just have a little tray,

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.000
and you just take it off in little passes,

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.000
build it up, slice it vertically.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.000
Here's the final hamburger.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.000
This is the 30-hour hamburger.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.000
We make every aspect of this burger.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:04.000
The lettuce has got liquid smoke infused into it.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:07.000
We also have things about how to make the bun.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:10.000
There's a mushroom, ketchup -- it goes on and on.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:13.000
Now watch closely. This is popcorn. I'll explain it here.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.000
The popcorn is illustrating

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.000
a key thing in physics.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.000
Isn't that beautiful?

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:22.000
We have a very high-speed camera,

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.000
which we had lots of fun with on the book.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000
The key physics principle here

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000
is when water boils to steam

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.000
it expands by a factor of 1,600.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000
That's what's happening to the water inside that popcorn.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.000
So it's a great illustration of that.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:37.000
Now I'm going to close with a video that is kind of unusual.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.000
We have a chapter on gels.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.000
And because people watch Mythbusters and CSI,

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.000
I thought, well, let's put in a recipe

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:47.000
for a ballistics gelatin.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.000
Well, if you have a high-speed camera,

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:52.000
and you have a block of ballistics gelatin lying around,

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.000
pretty soon somebody does this.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.000
(Gasps)

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.000
Now the amazing thing here

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000
is that a ballistics gelatin is supposed to mimic

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:05.000
what happens to human flesh when you get shot -- that's why you shouldn't get shot.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:08.000
The other amazing thing is, when this ballistics gelatin comes down,

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.000
it falls back down as a nice block.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:13.000
Anyway, here's the book.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.000
Here it is.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:20.000
2,438 pages.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:24.000
And they're nice big pages too.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:32.000
(Applause)

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.000
A friend of mine complained

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.000
that this was too big and too pretty to go in the kitchen,

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.000
so there's a sixth volume

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.000
that has washable, waterproof paper.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:44.000
(Applause)
