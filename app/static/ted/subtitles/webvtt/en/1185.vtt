00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Do you know

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
how many species of flowering plants there are?

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
There are a quarter of a million -- at least those are the ones we know about --

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
a quarter of a million species of flowering plants.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
And flowers are a real bugger.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
They're really difficult for plants to produce.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
They take an enormous amount of energy and a lot of resources.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Why would they go to that bother?

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
And the answer of course, like so many things in the world,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
is sex.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
I know what's on your mind when you're looking at these pictures.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
And the reason that sexual reproduction is so important --

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
there are lots of other things that plants can do to reproduce.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
You can take cuttings;

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
they can sort of have sex with themselves;

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
they can pollinate themselves.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
But they really need to spread their genes

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
to mix with other genes

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
so that they can adapt to environmental niches.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
Evolution works that way.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
Now the way that plants transmit that information

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
is through pollen.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
Some of you may have seen some of these pictures before.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
As I say, every home should have a scanning electron microscope

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
to be able to see these.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
And there is as many different kinds of pollen

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
as there are flowering plants.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
And that's actually rather useful for forensics and so on.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
Most pollen that causes hay fever for us

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
is from plants that use the wind

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
to disseminate the pollen,

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
and that's a very inefficient process,

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
which is why it gets up our noses so much.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
Because you have to chuck out masses and masses of it,

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
hoping that your sex cells, your male sex cells,

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
which are held within the pollen,

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
will somehow reach another flower just by chance.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
So all the grasses, which means all of the cereal crops,

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
and most of the trees

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
have wind-borne pollen.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
But most species

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
actually use insects to do their bidding,

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
and that's more intelligent in a way,

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
because the pollen, they don't need so much of it.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
The insects

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
and other species

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
can take the pollen,

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
transfer it directly to where it's required.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
So we're aware, obviously, of the relationship

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
between insects and plants.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
There's a symbiotic relationship there,

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
whether it's flies or birds or bees,

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
they're getting something in return,

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
and that something in return is generally nectar.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
Sometimes that symbiosis

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
has led to wonderful adaptations --

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
the hummingbird hawk-moth

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
is beautiful in its adaptation.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
The plant gets something,

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000
and the hawk-moth spreads the pollen somewhere else.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
Plants have evolved

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
to create little landing strips here and there

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
for bees that might have lost their way.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
There are markings on many plants

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000
that look like other insects.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
These are the anthers of a lily,

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
cleverly done

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000
so that when the unsuspecting insect

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
lands on it,

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
the anther flips up and whops it on the back

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000
with a great load of pollen that it then goes to another plant with.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000
And there's an orchid

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000
that might look to you as if it's got jaws,

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.000
and in a way, it has; it forces the insect to crawl out,

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000
getting covered in pollen that it takes somewhere else.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
Orchids: there are 20,000, at least,

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000
species of orchids --

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000
amazingly, amazingly diverse.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000
And they get up to all sorts of tricks.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000
They have to try and attract pollinators

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000
to do their bidding.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000
This orchid, known as Darwin's orchid,

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
because it's one that he studied

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
and made a wonderful prediction when he saw it --

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000
you can see that there's a very long nectar tube

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
that descends down

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
from the orchid.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
And basically what the insect has to do --

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
we're in the middle of the flower --

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
it has to stick its little proboscis

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000
right into the middle of that

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000
and all the way down that nectar tube

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000
to get to the nectar.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.000
And Darwin said, looking at this flower,

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000
"I guess something has coevolved with this."

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000
And sure enough,

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000
there's the insect.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000
And I mean, normally it kind of rolls it away,

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000
but in its erect form,

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000
that's what it looks like.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000
Now you can imagine

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000
that if nectar

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000
is such a valuable thing

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000
and expensive for the plant to produce

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000
and it attracts lots of pollinators,

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000
then, just as in human sex,

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000
people might start to deceive.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.000
They might say, "I've got a bit of nectar. Do you want to come and get it?"

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.000
Now this is a plant.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000
This is a plant here

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.000
that insects in South Africa just love,

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.000
and they've evolved with a long proboscis

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000
to get the nectar at the bottom.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000
And this is the mimic.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.000
So this is a plant that is mimicking the first plant.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.000
And here is the long-probosced fly

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.000
that has not gotten any nectar from the mimic,

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.000
because the mimic doesn't give it any nectar. It thought it would get some.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000
So not only has the fly

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000
not got the nectar from the mimic plant,

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000
it's also -- if you look very closely

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.000
just at the head end, you can see that it's got a bit of pollen

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
that it would be transmitting to another plant,

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000
if only some botanist hadn't come along

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000
and stuck it to a blue piece of card.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:01.000
(Laughter)

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.000
Now deceit carries on through the plant kingdom.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000
This flower with its black dots:

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000
they might look like black dots to us,

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.000
but if I tell you, to a male insect of the right species,

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000
that looks like two females

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000
who are really, really hot to trot.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000
(Laughter)

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.000
And when the insect gets there and lands on it,

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.000
dousing itself in pollen, of course, that it's going to take to another plant,

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:27.000
if you look at the every-home-should-have-one scanning electron microscope picture,

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000
you can see that there are actually some patterning there,

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000
which is three-dimensional.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.000
So it probably even feels good for the insect,

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.000
as well as looking good.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000
And these electron microscope pictures --

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.000
here's one of an orchid mimicking an insect --

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.000
you can see that different parts of the structure

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.000
have different colors and different textures to our eye,

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000
have very, very different textures

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.000
to what an insect might perceive.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.000
And this one is evolved to mimic

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.000
a glossy metallic surface

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000
you see on some beetles.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000
And under the scanning electron microscope,

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.000
you can see the surface there --

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:10.000
really quite different from the other surfaces we looked at.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000
Sometimes the whole plant

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.000
mimics an insect, even to us.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.000
I mean, I think that looks like some sort of flying animal or beast.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.000
It's a wonderful, amazing thing.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.000
This one's clever. It's called obsidian.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000
I think of it as insidium sometimes.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.000
To the right species of bee,

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000
this looks like another very aggressive bee,

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:34.000
and it goes and bonks it on the head lots and lots of times to try and drive it away,

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000
and, of course, covers itself with pollen.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.000
The other thing it does

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.000
is that this plant mimics another orchid

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.000
that has a wonderful store

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.000
of food for insects.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.000
And this one doesn't have anything for them.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.000
So it's deceiving on two levels --

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.000
fabulous.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000
(Laughter)

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000
Here we see ylang ylang,

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.000
the component of many perfumes.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:01.000
I actually smelt someone with some on earlier.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.000
And the flowers don't really have to be that gaudy.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.000
They're sending out a fantastic array of scent

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.000
to any insect that'll have it.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000
This one doesn't smell so good.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.000
This is a flower

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:16.000
that really, really smells pretty nasty

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:19.000
and is designed, again, evolved,

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:22.000
to look like carrion.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.000
So flies love this.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.000
They fly in and they pollinate.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:31.000
This, which is helicodiceros,

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:34.000
is also known as dead horse arum.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000
I don't know what a dead horse actually smells like,

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.000
but this one probably smells pretty much like it.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.000
It's really horrible.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.000
And blowflies just can't help themselves.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.000
They fly into this thing,

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.000
and they fly all the way down it.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.000
They lay their eggs in it,

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.000
thinking it's a nice bit of carrion,

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:53.000
and not realizing that there's no food for the eggs, that the eggs are going to die,

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:56.000
but the plant, meanwhile, has benefited,

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.000
because the bristles release

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000
and the flies disappear

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.000
to pollinate the next flower -- fantastic.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.000
Here's arum, arum maculatum,

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:08.000
"lords and ladies," or "cuckoo-pint" in this country.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.000
I photographed this thing last week in Dorset.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000
This thing heats up

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.000
by about 15 degrees above ambient temperature --

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.000
amazing.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.000
And if you look down into it,

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:21.000
there's this sort of dam past the spadix,

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.000
flies get attracted by the heat --

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.000
which is boiling off volatile chemicals, little midges --

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:28.000
and they get trapped underneath in this container.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.000
They drink this fabulous nectar

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.000
and then they're all a bit sticky.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.000
At night they get covered in pollen,

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.000
which showers down over them,

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.000
and then the bristles that we saw above,

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:43.000
they sort of wilt and allow all these midges out, covered in pollen --

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.000
fabulous thing.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:48.000
Now if you think that's fabulous, this is one of my great favorites.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.000
This is the philodendron selloum.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:54.000
For anyone here from Brazil, you'll know about this plant.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.000
This is the most amazing thing.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.000
That sort of phallic bit there

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.000
is about a foot long.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000
And it does something

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:05.000
that no other plant that I know of does,

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.000
and that is that when it flowers --

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.000
that's the spadix in the middle there --

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.000
for a period of about two days,

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.000
it metabolizes in a way

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.000
which is rather similar to mammals.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.000
So instead of having starch,

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.000
which is the food of plants,

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.000
it takes something rather similar to brown fat

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.000
and burns it at such a rate

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:27.000
that it's burning fat, metabolizing,

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:30.000
about the rate of a small cat.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:33.000
And that's twice the energy output, weight for weight,

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.000
than a hummingbird --

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.000
absolutely astonishing.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.000
This thing does something else which is unusual.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:42.000
Not only will it raise itself to 115 Fahrenheit,

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.000
43 or 44 degrees Centigrade, for two days,

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:48.000
but it keeps constant temperature.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.000
There's a thermoregulation mechanism in there

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.000
that keeps constant temperature.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.000
"Now why does it do this," I hear you ask.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.000
Now wouldn't you know it,

00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:00.000
there's some beetles that just love to make love at that temperature.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.000
And they get inside, and they get it all on.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.000
(Laughter)

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.000
And the plant showers them with pollen,

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:10.000
and off they go and pollinate.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:13.000
And what a wonderful thing it is.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:16.000
Now most pollinators

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.000
that we think about are insects,

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.000
but actually in the tropics,

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:23.000
many birds and butterflies pollinate.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.000
And many of the tropical flowers are red,

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.000
and that's because butterflies and birds

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.000
see similarly to us, we think,

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:32.000
and can see the color red very well.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:35.000
But if you look at the spectrum,

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:38.000
birds and us, we see red, green and blue

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.000
and see that spectrum.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.000
Insects see green, blue and ultraviolet,

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.000
and they see various shades of ultraviolet.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:47.000
So there's something that goes on off the end there.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:50.000
"And wouldn't it be great if we could somehow see what that is," I hear you ask.

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.000
Well yes we can.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:55.000
So what is an insect seeing?

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.000
Last week I took these pictures of rock rose,

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.000
helianthemum, in Dorset.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:02.000
These are little yellow flowers like we all see,

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:04.000
little yellow flowers all over the place.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:07.000
And this is what it looks like with visible light.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:10.000
This is what it looks like if you take out the red.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:13.000
Most bees don't perceive red.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:17.000
And then I put some ultraviolet filters on my camera

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:20.000
and took a very, very long exposure

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:23.000
with the particular frequencies of ultraviolet light

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.000
and this is what I got.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:28.000
And that's a real fantastic bull's eye.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.000
Now we don't know

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.000
exactly what a bee sees,

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.000
any more than you know what I'm seeing

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:37.000
when I call this red.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:40.000
We can't know what's going on in -- let alone an insect's --

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:43.000
another human being's mind.

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:46.000
But the contrast will look something like that,

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.000
so standing out a lot from the background.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.000
Here's another little flower --

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:54.000
different range of ultraviolet frequencies,

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.000
different filters

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.000
to match the pollinators.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:01.000
And that's the sort of thing that it would be seeing.

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.000
Just in case you think

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:06.000
that all yellow flowers have this property --

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:09.000
no flower was damaged in the process of this shot;

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:12.000
it was just attached to the tripod,

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.000
not killed --

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.000
then under ultraviolet light,

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.000
look at that.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.000
And that could be the basis of a sunscreen

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.000
because sunscreens work by absorbing ultraviolet light.

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:25.000
So maybe the chemical in that would be useful.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:29.000
Finally, there's one of evening primrose

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:31.000
that Bjorn Rorslett from Norway sent me --

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:33.000
fantastic hidden pattern.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:35.000
And I love the idea of something hidden.

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:37.000
I think there's something poetic here,

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:40.000
that these pictures taken with ultraviolet filter,

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:42.000
the main use of that filter

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:45.000
is for astronomers to take pictures of Venus --

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:48.000
actually the clouds of Venus.

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.000
That's the main use of that filter.

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:53.000
Venus, of course, is the god of love and fertility,

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.000
which is the flower story.

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.000
And just as flowers spend a lot of effort

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:00.000
trying to get pollinators to do their bidding,

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:03.000
they've also somehow managed to persuade us to plant great fields full of them

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:05.000
and give them to each other

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:09.000
at times of birth and death,

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:11.000
and particularly at marriage,

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:13.000
which, when you think of it,

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:15.000
is the moment that encapsulates

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:18.000
the transfer of genetic material

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:20.000
from one organism to another.

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.000
Thank you very much.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:27.000
(Applause)
