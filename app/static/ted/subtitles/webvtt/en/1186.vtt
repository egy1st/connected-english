00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
There was a time in my life

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
when everything seemed perfect.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Everywhere I went, I felt at home.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Everyone I met,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
I felt I knew them for as long as I could remember.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
And I want to share with you how I came to that place

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
and what I've learned since I left it.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
This is where it began.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
And it raises an existential question,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
which is, if I'm having this experience of complete connection and full consciousness,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
why am I not visible in the photograph,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
and where is this time and place?

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
This is Los Angeles, California, where I live.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
This is a police photo. That's actually my car.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
We're less than a mile from one of the largest hospitals in Los Angeles,

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
called Cedars-Sinai.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
And the situation is that a car full of paramedics

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
on their way home from the hospital after work

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
have run across the wreckage,

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
and they've advised the police

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
that there were no survivors inside the car,

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
that the driver's dead, that I'm dead.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
And the police are waiting for the fire department to arrive

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
to cut apart the vehicle

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
to extract the body of the driver.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
And when they do, they find that behind the glass,

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
they find me.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
And my skull's crushed and my collar bone is crushed;

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
all but two of my ribs,

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
my pelvis and both arms --

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
they're all crushed, but there is still a pulse.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
And they get me to that nearby hospital,

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
Cedars-Sinai,

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
where that night I receive, because of my internal bleeding,

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
45 units of blood --

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
which means full replacements of all the blood in me --

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
before they're able to staunch the flow.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
I'm put on full life support,

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
and I have a massive stroke,

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
and my brain drops into a coma.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
Now comas are measured

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
on a scale from 15 down to three.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
Fifteen is a mild coma. Three is the deepest.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
And if you look, you'll see that there's only one way you can score three.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
It's essentially there's no sign of life

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
from outside at all.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
I spent more than a month in a Glasgow Coma Scale three,

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
and it is inside that deepest level of coma,

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
on the rim between my life and my death,

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
that I'm experiencing the full connection and full consciousness

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
of inner space.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000
From my family looking in from outside,

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
what they're trying to figure out

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
is a different kind of existential question,

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000
which is, how far is it going to be possible to bridge

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000
from the comatose potential mind that they're looking at

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
to an actual mind,

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
which I define simply

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
as the functioning of the brain

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
that is remaining inside my head.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
Now to put this into a broader context,

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
I want you to imagine that you are an eternal alien

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
watching the Earth from outer space,

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000
and your favorite show on intergalactic satellite television

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
is the Earth channel,

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
and your favorite show is the Human Show.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
And the reason I think it would be so interesting to you

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
is because consciousness is so interesting.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
It's so unpredictable

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
and so fragile.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000
And this is how we began.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.000
We all began in the Awash Valley in Ethiopia.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
The show began with tremendous special effects,

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
because there were catastrophic climate shifts --

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
which sort of sounds interesting as a parallel to today.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000
Because of the Earth tilting on its axis

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000
and those catastrophic climate shifts,

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
we had to figure out how to find better food,

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000
and we had to learn -- there's Lucy; that's how we all began --

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000
we had to learn how to crack open animal bones,

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000
use tools to do that, to feed on the marrow,

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000
to grow our brains more.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000
So we actually grew our consciousness

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
in response to this global threat.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
Now you also continue to watch

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
as consciousness evolved to the point

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.000
that here in India, in Madhya Pradesh,

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.000
there's one of the two oldest known pieces of rock art found.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:39.000
It's a cupule that took 40 to 50,000 blows with a stone tool to create,

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000
and it's the first known expression of art

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000
on the planet.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000
And the reason it connects us with consciousness today

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000
is that all of us still today,

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.000
the very first shape we draw as a child

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000
is a circle.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.000
And then the next thing we do is we put a dot in the center of the circle.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000
We create an eye --

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
and the eye that evolves through all of our history.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
There's the Egyptian god Horus,

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.000
which symbolizes prosperity, wisdom and health.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.000
And that comes down right way to the present

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000
with the dollar bill in the United States,

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000
which has on it an eye of providence.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000
So watching all of this show from outer space,

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000
you think we get it, we understand

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000
that the most precious resource on the blue planet

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000
is our consciousness.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000
Because it's the first thing we draw;

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000
we surround ourselves with images of it;

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000
it's probably the most common image on the planet.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.000
But we don't. We take our consciousness for granted.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.000
While I was producing in Los Angeles, I never thought about it for a second.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000
Until it was stripped from me, I never thought about it.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000
And what I've learned since that event

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000
and during my recovery

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.000
is that consciousness is under threat on this planet

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000
in ways it's never been under threat before.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000
These are just some examples.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000
And the reason I'm so honored to be here

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000
to talk today in India

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000
is because India has the sad distinction

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000
of being the head injury capital of the world.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000
That statistic is so sad.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.000
There is no more drastic and sudden gap created

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000
between potential and actual mind

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000
than a severe head injury.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000
Each one can entail up to a decade of rehabilitation,

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000
which means that India, unless something changes,

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000
is accumulating a need

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.000
for millennia of rehabilitation.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000
What you find in the United States

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.000
is an injury every 20 seconds -- that's one and a half million every year --

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000
stroke every 40 seconds,

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.000
Alzheimer's disease, every 70 seconds somebody succumbs to that.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000
All of these represent gaps

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.000
between potential mind and actual mind.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000
And here are some of the other categories, if you look at the whole planet.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.000
The World Health Organization tells us

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.000
that depression is the number one disease on Earth

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.000
in terms of years lived with disability.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.000
We find that the number two source of disability

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000
is depression in the age group

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.000
of 15 to 44.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000
Our children are becoming depressed

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000
at an alarming rate.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.000
I discovered during my recovery

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000
the third leading cause of death amongst teenagers

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000
is suicide.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000
If you look at some of these other items -- concussions.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000
Half of E.R. admissions from adolescents

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.000
are for concussions.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.000
If I talk about migraine,

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000
40 percent of the population

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000
suffer episodic headaches.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000
Fifteen percent suffer migraines

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000
that wipe them out for days on end.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.000
All of this is leading -- computer addiction,

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.000
just to cover that: the most frequent thing we do

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000
is use digital devices.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000
The average teenager

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.000
sends 3,300 texts every [month].

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000
We're talking about a society that is retreating

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.000
into depression and disassociation

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000
when we are potentially confronting

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.000
the next great catastrophic climate shift.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.000
So what you'd be wondering, watching the Human Show,

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000
is are we going to confront and address

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.000
the catastrophic climate shift that may be heading our way

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.000
by growing our consciousness,

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.000
or are we going to continue to retreat?

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000
And that then might lead you

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000
to watch an episode one day

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:52.000
of Cedars-Sinai medical center

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:55.000
and a consideration of the difference between potential mind and actual mind.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.000
This is a dense array EEG MRI

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000
tracking 156 channels of information.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.000
It's not my EEG at Cedars;

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.000
it's your EEG tonight and last night.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.000
It's the what our minds do every night

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.000
to digest the day

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.000
and to prepare to bridge from the potential mind when we're asleep

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.000
to the actual mind when we awaken the following morning.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.000
This is how I was when I returned from the hospital

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.000
after nearly four months.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.000
The horseshoe shape you can see on my skull

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.000
is where they operated and went inside my brain

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.000
to do the surgeries they needed to do to rescue my life.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.000
But if you look into the eye of consciousness, that single eye you can see,

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000
I'm looking down,

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.000
but let me tell you how I felt at that point.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.000
I didn't feel empty; I felt everything simultaneously.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:40.000
I felt empty and full, hot and cold,

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.000
euphoric and depressed

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.000
because the brain is the world's first

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.000
fully functional quantum computer;

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:49.000
it can occupy multiple states at the same time.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:52.000
And with all the internal regulators of my brain damaged,

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:55.000
I felt everything simultaneously.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:58.000
But let's swivel around and look at me frontally.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000
This is now flash-forward to the point in time

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.000
where I've been discharged by the health system.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.000
Look into those eyes. I'm not able to focus those eyes.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:08.000
I'm not able to follow a line of text in a book.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.000
But the system has moved me on

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:13.000
because, as my family started to discover,

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.000
there is no long-term concept

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.000
in the health care system.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:20.000
Neurological damage, 10 years of rehab,

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.000
requires a long-term perspective.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.000
But let's take a look behind my eyes.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000
This is a gamma radiation spec scan

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000
that uses gamma radiation

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.000
to map three-dimensional function within the brain.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.000
It requires a laboratory to see it in three dimension,

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.000
but in two dimensions I think you can see

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.000
the beautiful symmetry and illumination

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.000
of a normal mind at work.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.000
Here's my brain.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:44.000
That is the consequence of more than a third of the right side of my brain

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000
being destroyed by the stroke.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.000
So my family, as we moved forward

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.000
and discovered that the health care system had moved us by,

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.000
had to try to find solutions and answers.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:56.000
And during that process -- it took many years --

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:59.000
one of the doctors said that my recovery, my degree of advance,

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.000
since the amount of head injury I'd suffered,

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.000
was miraculous.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.000
And that was when I started to write a book,

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.000
because I didn't think it was miraculous.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.000
I thought there were miraculous elements,

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.000
but I also didn't think it was right

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.000
that one should have to struggle and search for answers

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:16.000
when this is a pandemic within our society.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:19.000
So from this experience of my recovery,

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:22.000
I want to share four particular aspects --

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.000
I call them the four C's of consciousness --

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:27.000
that helped me grow my potential mind

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:30.000
back towards the actual mind that I work with every day.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.000
The first C is cognitive training.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:35.000
Unlike the smashed glass of my car,

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.000
plasticity of the brain

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:40.000
means that there was always a possibility, with treatment,

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.000
to train the brain

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.000
so that you can regain and raise your level of awareness and consciousness.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.000
Plasticity means that there was always

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.000
hope for our reason --

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:52.000
hope for our ability to rebuild that function.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.000
Indeed, the mind can redefine itself,

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:57.000
and this is demonstrated by two specialists called Hagen and Silva

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.000
back in the 1970's.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.000
The global perspective

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.000
is that up to 30 percent of children in school

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.000
have learning weaknesses

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.000
that are not self-correcting,

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.000
but with appropriate treatment,

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:12.000
they can be screened for and detected and corrected

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.000
and avoid their academic failure.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:17.000
But what I discovered is it's almost impossible to find anyone

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.000
who provides that treatment or care.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.000
Here's what my neuropsychologist provided for me

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:24.000
when I actually found somebody who could apply it.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:27.000
I'm not a doctor, so I'm not going to talk about the various subtests.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.000
Let's just talk about full-scale I.Q.

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.000
Full-scale I.Q. is the mental processing --

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:33.000
how fast you can acquire information,

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.000
retain it and retrieve it --

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:38.000
that is essential for success in life today.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.000
And you can see here there are three columns.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:43.000
Untestable -- that's when I'm in my coma.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:46.000
And then I creep up to the point that I get a score of 79,

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:49.000
which is just below average.

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:52.000
In the health care system, if you touch average, you're done.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:54.000
That's when I was discharged from the system.

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:57.000
What does average I.Q. really mean?

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:00.000
It meant that when I was given two and a half hours

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.000
to take a test that anyone here

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:04.000
would take in 50 minutes,

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:07.000
I might score an F.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.000
This is a very, very low level

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.000
in order to be kicked out of the health care system.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.000
Then I underwent cognitive training.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.000
And let me show you what happened to the right-hand column

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:18.000
when I did my cognitive training over a period of time.

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:21.000
This is not supposed to occur.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:24.000
I.Q. is supposed to stabilize and solidify

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.000
at the age of eight.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.000
Now the Journal of the National Medical Association

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.000
gave my memoir a full clinical review,

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.000
which is very unusual.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:35.000
I'm not a doctor. I have no medical background whatsoever.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:37.000
But they felt the evidences

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:40.000
that there was important, valuable information in the book,

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:43.000
and they commented about it when they gave the full peer review to it.

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:46.000
But they asked one question. They said, "Is this repeatable?"

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.000
That was a fair question

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:51.000
because my memoir was simply how I found solutions that worked for me.

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.000
The answer is yes, and for the first time,

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.000
it's my pleasure to be able to share two examples.

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:57.000
Here's somebody, what they did as they went through cognitive training

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.000
at ages seven and 11.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:02.000
And here's another person in, call it, high school and college.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.000
And this person is particularly interesting.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.000
I won't go into the intrascatter that's in the subtests,

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.000
but they still had a neurologic issue.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.000
But that person could be identified

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.000
as having a learning disability.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.000
And with accommodation, they went on to college

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:17.000
and had a full life in terms of their opportunities.

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:19.000
Second aspect:

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:21.000
I still had crushing migraine headaches.

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:23.000
Two elements that worked for me here

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:27.000
are -- the first is 90 percent, I learned, of head and neck pain

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:29.000
is through muscular-skeletal imbalance.

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:33.000
The craniomandibular system is critical to that.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:36.000
And when I underwent it and found solutions,

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:39.000
this is the interrelationship between the TMJ and the teeth.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:41.000
Up to 30 percent of the population

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:44.000
have a disorder, disease or dysfunction in the jaw

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:46.000
that affects the entire body.

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.000
I was fortunate to find a dentist

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.000
who applied this entire universe

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:52.000
of technology you're about to see

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.000
to establish that if he repositioned my jaw,

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.000
the headaches pretty much resolved,

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.000
but that then my teeth weren't in the right place.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.000
He then held my jaw in the right position

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:04.000
while orthodontically he put my teeth into correct alignment.

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:07.000
So my teeth actually hold my jaw in the correct position.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:10.000
This affected my entire body.

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.000
If that sounds like a very, very strange thing to say

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.000
and rather a bold statement --

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.000
How can the jaw affect the entire body? --

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.000
let me simply point out to you,

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:20.000
if I ask you tomorrow

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.000
to put one grain of sand between your teeth

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.000
and go for a nice long walk,

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.000
how far would you last

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:28.000
before you had to remove that grain of sand?

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.000
That tiny misalignment.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.000
Bear in mind, there are no nerves in the teeth.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:35.000
That's why the same between the before and after that this shows,

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:37.000
it's hard to see the difference.

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:39.000
Now just trying putting a few grains of sand between your teeth

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:41.000
and see the difference it makes.

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:43.000
I still had migraine headaches.

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:45.000
The next issue that resolved

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.000
was that, if 90 percent of head and neck pain

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:49.000
is caused by imbalance,

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:51.000
the other 10 percent, largely --

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:53.000
if you set aside aneurysms, brain cancer

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.000
and hormonal issues --

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.000
is the circulation.

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:59.000
Imagine the blood flowing through your body --

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:01.000
I was told at UCLA Medical Center --

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:03.000
as one sealed system.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:05.000
There's a big pipe with the blood flowing through it,

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:07.000
and around that pipe are the nerves

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:09.000
drawing their nutrient supply from the blood.

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:11.000
That's basically it.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:13.000
If you press on a hose pipe in a sealed system,

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:15.000
it bulges someplace else.

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:17.000
If that some place else where it bulges

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:20.000
is inside the biggest nerve in your body, your brain,

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:22.000
you get a vascular migraine.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:24.000
This is a level of pain that's only known

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:27.000
to other people who suffer vascular migraines.

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:29.000
Using this technology,

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:31.000
this is mapping in three dimensions.

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:33.000
This is an MRI MRA MRV,

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:35.000
a volumetric MRI.

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:38.000
Using this technology, the specialists at UCLA Medical Center

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:40.000
were able to identify

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.000
where that compression in the hose pipe was occurring.

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:46.000
A vascular surgeon removed most of the first rib on both sides of my body.

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.000
And in the following months and years,

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:51.000
I felt the neurological flow of life itself returning.

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:54.000
Communication, the next C. This is critical.

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:57.000
All consciousness is about communication.

00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:59.000
And here, by great fortune,

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:01.000
one of my father's clients

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.000
had a husband who worked

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:06.000
at the Alfred Mann Foundation for Scientific Research.

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:08.000
Alfred Mann is a brilliant physicist and innovator

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:11.000
who's fascinated with bridging gaps in consciousness,

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:14.000
whether to restore hearing to the deaf, vision to the blind

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:16.000
or movement to the paralyzed.

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:18.000
And I'm just going to give you an example today

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.000
of movement to the paralyzed.

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:23.000
I've brought with me, from Southern California,

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:25.000
the FM device.

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:27.000
This is it being held in the hand.

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:29.000
It weighs less than a gram.

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:32.000
So two of them implanted in the body would weigh less than a dime.

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:34.000
Five of them would still weigh less

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:36.000
than a rupee coin.

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:38.000
Where does it go inside the body?

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:40.000
It has been simulated and tested to endure in the body corrosion-free

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:42.000
for over 80 years.

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:44.000
So it goes in and it stays there.

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:46.000
Here are the implantation sites.

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:49.000
The concept that they're working towards -- and they have working prototypes --

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:51.000
is that we placed it throughout the motor points of the body

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:53.000
where they're needed.

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:55.000
The main unit will then go inside the brain.

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:58.000
An FM device in the cortex of the brain, the motor cortex,

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:00.000
will send signals in real time

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:02.000
to the motor points in the relevant muscles

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:05.000
so that the person will be able to move their arm, let's say, in real time,

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:07.000
if they've lost control of their arm.

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:10.000
And other FM devices implanted in fingertips,

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:12.000
on contacting a surface,

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:15.000
will send a message back to the sensory cortex of the brain,

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:18.000
so that the person feels a sense of touch.

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:20.000
Is this science fiction? No,

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:23.000
because I'm wearing the first application of this technology.

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:25.000
I don't have the ability to control my left foot.

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:28.000
A radio device is controlling every step I take,

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:30.000
and a sensor picks up my foot for me

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:32.000
every time I walk.

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:34.000
And in closing, I want to share

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:36.000
the personal reason why this meant so much to me

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:38.000
and changed the direction of my life.

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:40.000
In my coma, one of the presences I sensed

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:42.000
was someone I felt was a protector.

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:45.000
And when I came out of my coma, I recognized my family,

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:48.000
but I didn't remember my own past.

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:51.000
Gradually, I remembered the protector was my wife.

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:53.000
And I whispered the good news

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:55.000
through my broken jaw, which was wired shut,

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:57.000
to my night nurse.

00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:59.000
And the following morning, my mother came to explain

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:01.000
that I'd not always been in this bed, in this room,

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:03.000
that I'd been working in film and television

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:05.000
and that I had been in a crash

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:08.000
and that, yes, I was married,

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:11.000
but Marcy had been killed instantly in the crash.

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:13.000
And during my time in coma,

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:17.000
she had been laid to rest in her hometown of Phoenix.

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:20.000
Now in the dark years that followed, I had to work out what remained for me

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:23.000
if everything that made today special was gone.

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:26.000
And as I discovered these threats to consciousness

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:28.000
and how they are surrounding the world

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:31.000
and enveloping the lives of more and more people every day,

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:33.000
I discovered what truly remained.

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:36.000
I believe that we can overcome the threats to our consciousness,

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:38.000
that the Human Show can stay on the air

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:40.000
for millennia to come.

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:43.000
I believe that we can all rise and shine.

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:45.000
Thank you very much.

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:51.000
(Applause)

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:54.000
Lakshmi Pratury: Just stay for a second. Just stay here for a second.

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:58.000
(Applause)

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:01.000
You know,

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:05.000
when I heard Simon's --

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:08.000
please sit down; I just want to talk to him for a second --

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:11.000
when I read his book, I went to LA to meet him.

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:14.000
And so I was sitting in this restaurant,

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:17.000
waiting for a man to come by

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:19.000
who obviously would have some difficulty ...

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:21.000
I don't know what I had in my mind.

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:23.000
And he was walking around.

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:25.000
I didn't expect that person that I was going to meet

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:27.000
to be him.

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:29.000
And then we met and we talked,

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:31.000
and I'm like, he doesn't look

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:35.000
like somebody who was built out of nothing.

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:37.000
And then I was amazed

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:39.000
at what role technology played

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:41.000
in your recovery.

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:43.000
And we have his book outside

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:45.000
in the bookshop.

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:47.000
The thing that amazed me

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:50.000
is the painstaking detail

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:52.000
with which he has written

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:54.000
every hospital he has been to,

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:56.000
every treatment he got,

00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:59.000
every near-miss he had,

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:03.000
and how accidentally he stumbled upon innovations.

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:08.000
So I think this one detail

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:10.000
went past people really quick.

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:13.000
Tell a little bit about what you're wearing on your leg.

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:15.000
Simon Lewis: I knew when I was timing this

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:17.000
that there wouldn't be time for me to do anything about --

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:20.000
Well this is it. This is the control unit.

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:22.000
And this records every single step I've taken

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:24.000
for, ooh, five or six years now.

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:27.000
And if I do this, probably the mic won't hear it.

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:32.000
That little chirp followed by two chirps is now switched on.

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:35.000
When I press it again, it'll chirp three times,

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:38.000
and that'll mean that it's armed and ready to go.

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:42.000
And that's my friend. I mean, I charge it every night.

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:44.000
And it works. It works.

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:47.000
And what I would love to add because I didn't have time ...

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:50.000
What does it do? Well actually, I'll show you down here.

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:53.000
This down here, if the camera can see that,

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:56.000
that is a small antenna.

00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:59.000
Underneath my heel, there is a sensor

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:01.000
that detects when my foot leaves the ground --

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:03.000
what's called the heel lift.

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:06.000
This thing blinks all the time; I'll leave it out, so you might be able to see it.

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:09.000
But this is blinking all the time. It's sending signals in real time.

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:12.000
And if you walk faster, if I walk faster,

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:14.000
it detects what's called the time interval,

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:16.000
which is the interval between each heel lift.

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:20.000
And it accelerates the amount and level of the stimulation.

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:23.000
The other things they've worked on -- I didn't have time to say this in my talk --

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:25.000
is they've restored functional hearing

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:27.000
to thousands of deaf people.

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:30.000
I could tell you the story: this was going to be an abandoned technology,

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:32.000
but Alfred Mann met the doctor who was going to retire,

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:34.000
[Dr. Schindler.]

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:37.000
And he was going to retire -- all the technology was going to be lost,

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:40.000
because not a single medical manufacturer would take it on

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:42.000
because it was a small issue.

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:45.000
But there's millions of deaf people in the world,

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:48.000
and the Cochlear implant has given hearing to thousands of deaf people now.

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:50.000
It works.

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:53.000
And the other thing is they're working on artificial retinas for the blind.

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:56.000
And this, this is the implantable generation.

00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:58.000
Because what I didn't say in my talk

00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:00.000
is this is actually exoskeletal.

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:02.000
I should clarify that.

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:04.000
Because the first generation is exoskeletal,

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:06.000
it's wrapped around the leg,

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:08.000
around the affected limb.

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:10.000
I must tell you, they're an amazing --

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:12.000
there's a hundred people who work in that building --

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:14.000
engineers, scientists,

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:16.000
and other team members -- all the time.

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:19.000
Alfred Mann has set up this foundation

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:21.000
to advance this research

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:23.000
because he saw

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:26.000
there's no way venture capital would come in for something like this.

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:28.000
The audience is too small.

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:30.000
You'd think, there's plenty of paralyzed people in the world,

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:32.000
but the audience is too small,

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:35.000
and the amount of research, the time it takes,

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:37.000
the FDA clearances,

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:39.000
the payback time is too long

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:41.000
for V.C. to be interested.

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:43.000
So he saw a need and he stepped in.

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:46.000
He's a very, very remarkable man.

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:49.000
He's done a lot of very cutting-edge science.

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:51.000
LP: So when you get a chance, spend some time with Simon.

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:53.000
Thank you. Thank you.

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:55.000
(Applause)
