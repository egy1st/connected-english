00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Good morning everybody.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
I work with really amazing,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
little, itty-bitty creatures called cells.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
And let me tell you what it's like

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
to grow these cells in the lab.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
I work in a lab where we take cells out of their native environment.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
We plate them into dishes

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
that we sometimes call petri dishes.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
And we feed them -- sterilely of course --

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
with what we call cell culture media -- which is like their food --

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
and we grow them in incubators.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Why do I do this?

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
We observe the cells in a plate,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
and they're just on the surface.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
But what we're really trying to do in my lab

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
is to engineer tissues out of them.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
What does that even mean?

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
Well it means growing an actual heart,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
let's say,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
or grow a piece of bone

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
that can be put into the body.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
Not only that, but they can also be used for disease models.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
And for this purpose, traditional cell culture techniques

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
just really aren't enough.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
The cells are kind of homesick;

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
the dish doesn't feel like their home.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
And so we need to do better at copying their natural environment

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
to get them to thrive.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
We call this the biomimetic paradigm --

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
copying nature in the lab.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
Let's take the example of the heart,

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
the topic of a lot of my research.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
What makes the heart unique?

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
Well, the heart beats,

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
rhythmically, tirelessly, faithfully.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
We copy this in the lab

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
by outfitting cell culture systems with electrodes.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
These electrodes act like mini pacemakers

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
to get the cells to contract in the lab.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
What else do we know about the heart?

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
Well, heart cells are pretty greedy.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
Nature feeds the heart cells in your body

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
with a very, very dense blood supply.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
In the lab, we micro-pattern channels

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
in the biomaterials

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
on which we grow the cells,

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
and this allows us to flow the cell culture media, the cells' food,

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
through the scaffolds where we're growing the cells --

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
a lot like what you might expect

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
from a capillary bed in the heart.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
So this brings me to lesson number one:

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
life can do a lot with very little.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
Let's take the example of electrical stimulation.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
Let's see how powerful just one of these essentials can be.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
On the left, we see a tiny piece of beating heart tissue

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
that I engineered from rat cells in the lab.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
It's about the size of a mini marshmallow.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
And after one week, it's beating.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
You can see it in the upper left-hand corner.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
But don't worry if you can't see it so well.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000
It's amazing that these cells beat at all.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
But what's really amazing

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
is that the cells, when we electrically stimulate them,

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
like with a pacemaker,

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
that they beat so much more.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
But that brings me to lesson number two:

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
cells do all the work.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000
In a sense, tissue engineers have a bit of an identity crisis here,

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000
because structural engineers

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000
build bridges and big things,

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
computer engineers, computers,

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
but what we are doing

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000
is actually building enabling technologies for the cells themselves.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000
What does this mean for us?

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
Let's do something really simple.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
Let's remind ourselves

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000
that cells are not an abstract concept.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000
Let's remember that our cells sustain our lives

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
in a very real way.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000
"We are what we eat," could easily be described

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
as, "We are what our cells eat."

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
And in the case of the flora in our gut,

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000
these cells may not even be human.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
But it's also worth noting

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000
that cells also mediate our experience of life.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.000
Behind every sound, sight, touch, taste and smell

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000
is a corresponding set of cells

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
that receive this information

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000
and interpret it for us.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
It begs the question:

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.000
shall we expand our sense of environmental stewardship

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.000
to include the ecosystem of our own bodies?

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000
I invite you to talk about this with me further,

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000
and in the meantime, I wish you luck.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000
May none of your non-cancer cells

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000
become endangered species.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000
Thank you.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.000
(Applause)
