WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
So I begin with an advertisement

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
inspired by George Orwell

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
that Apple ran in 1984.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
(Video) Big Brother: We are one people

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
with one will, one resolve,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
one cause.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Our enemies shall talk themselves to death,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
and we will fight them with their own confusion.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
We shall prevail.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Narrator: On January 24th,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Apple Computer will introduce Macintosh.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
And you'll see why 1984

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
won't be like "1984."

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
Rebecca MacKinnon: So the underlying message of this video

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
remains very powerful even today.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
Technology created by innovative companies

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
will set us all free.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
Fast-forward more than two decades:

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
Apple launches the iPhone in China

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
and censors the Dalai Lama out

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
along with several other politically sensitive applications

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
at the request of the Chinese government

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
for its Chinese app store.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
The American political cartoonist

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
Mark Fiore

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
also had his satire application

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
censored in the United States

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
because some of Apple's staff

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
were concerned it would be offensive to some groups.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
His app wasn't reinstated

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
until he won the Pulitzer Prize.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000
The German magazine Stern, a news magazine,

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
had its app censored

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
because the Apple nannies deemed it

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
to be a little bit too racy for their users,

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
and despite the fact that this magazine

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
is perfectly legal for sale

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
on newsstands throughout Germany.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
And more controversially, recently,

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
Apple censored a Palestinian protest app

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
after the Israeli government voiced concerns

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
that it might be used to organize violent attacks.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
So here's the thing.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
We have a situation where private companies

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
are applying censorship standards

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
that are often quite arbitrary

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
and generally more narrow

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
than the free speech constitutional standards

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
that we have in democracies.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000
Or they're responding to censorship requests

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
by authoritarian regimes

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
that do not reflect consent of the governed.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
Or they're responding to requests and concerns

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.000
by governments that have no jurisdiction

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
over many, or most, of the users and viewers

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
who are interacting with the content in question.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
So here's the situation.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000
In a pre-Internet world,

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000
sovereignty over our physical freedoms,

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
or lack thereof,

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
was controlled almost entirely

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
by nation-states.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
But now we have this new layer

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
of private sovereignty

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
in cyberspace.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
And their decisions about software coding,

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
engineering, design, terms of service

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
all act as a kind of law

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.000
that shapes what we can and cannot do with our digital lives.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
And their sovereignties,

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
cross-cutting, globally interlinked,

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000
can in some ways

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
challenge the sovereignties of nation-states

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
in very exciting ways,

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000
but sometimes also act

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000
to project and extend it

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000
at a time when control

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
over what people can and cannot do

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
with information

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
has more effect than ever

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
on the exercise of power

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000
in our physical world.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000
After all, even the leader of the free world

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000
needs a little help from the sultan of Facebookistan

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.000
if he wants to get reelected next year.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000
And these platforms

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000
were certainly very helpful

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000
to activists in Tunisia and Egypt

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000
this past spring and beyond.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.000
As Wael Ghonim,

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.000
the Google-Egyptian-executive by day,

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000
secret-Facebook-activist by night,

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000
famously said to CNN

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
after Mubarak stepped down,

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000
"If you want to liberate a society,

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000
just give them the Internet."

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000
But overthrowing a government is one thing

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000
and building a stable democracy

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000
is a bit more complicated.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000
On the left there's a photo taken by an Egyptian activist

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000
who was part of the storming

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.000
of the Egyptian state security offices in March.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000
And many of the agents

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000
shredded as many of the documents as they could

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000
and left them behind in piles.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.000
But some of the files were left behind intact,

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000
and activists, some of them,

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.000
found their own surveillance dossiers

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.000
full of transcripts of their email exchanges,

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000
their cellphone text message exchanges,

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000
even Skype conversations.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000
And one activist actually found

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.000
a contract from a Western company

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000
for the sale of surveillance technology

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000
to the Egyptian security forces.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
And Egyptian activists are assuming

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000
that these technologies for surveillance

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000
are still being used

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.000
by the transitional authorities running the networks there.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000
And in Tunisia, censorship actually began to return in May --

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000
not nearly as extensively

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.000
as under President Ben Ali.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000
But you'll see here a blocked page

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000
of what happens when you try to reach

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000
certain Facebook pages and some other websites

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000
that the transitional authorities

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.000
have determined might incite violence.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000
In protest over this,

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000
blogger Slim Amamou,

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000
who had been jailed under Ben Ali

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000
and then became part of the transitional government

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000
after the revolution,

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.000
he resigned in protest from the cabinet.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.000
But there's been a lot of debate in Tunisia

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000
about how to handle this kind of problem.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.000
In fact, on Twitter,

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000
there were a number of people who were supportive of the revolution

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000
who said, "Well actually,

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.000
we do want democracy and free expression,

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.000
but there is some kinds of speech that need to be off-bounds

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.000
because it's too violent and it might be destabilizing for our democracy.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000
But the problem is,

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.000
how do you decide who is in power to make these decisions

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000
and how do you make sure

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.000
that they do not abuse their power?

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000
As Riadh Guerfali,

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.000
the veteran digital activist from Tunisia,

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000
remarked over this incident,

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000
"Before, things were simple:

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.000
you had the good guys on one side and the bad guys on the other.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.000
Today, things are a lot more subtle."

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.000
Welcome to democracy, our Tunisian and Egyptian friends.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.000
The reality is

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.000
that even in democratic societies today,

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.000
we do not have good answers

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.000
for how you balance the need

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:28.000
for security and law enforcement on one hand

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000
and protection of civil liberties

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000
and free speech on the other

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000
in our digital networks.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000
In fact, in the United States,

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.000
whatever you may think of Julian Assange,

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.000
even people who are not necessarily big fans of his

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000
are very concerned about the way

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.000
in which the United States government and some companies have handled Wikileaks.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.000
Amazon webhosting dropped Wikileaks as a customer

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:54.000
after receiving a complaint from U.S. Senator Joe Lieberman,

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000
despite the fact

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.000
that Wikileaks had not been charged,

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000
let alone convicted,

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.000
of any crime.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.000
So we assume

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:08.000
that the Internet is a border-busting technology.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:11.000
This is a map of social networks worldwide,

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.000
and certainly Facebook has conquered much of the world --

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.000
which is either a good or a bad thing,

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.000
depending on how you like

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.000
the way Facebook manages its service.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.000
But borders do persist

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.000
in some parts of cyberspace.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.000
In Brazil and Japan,

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.000
it's for unique cultural and linguistic reasons.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000
But if you look at China, Vietnam

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:34.000
and a number of the former Soviet states,

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000
what's happening there is more troubling.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.000
You have a situation

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.000
where the relationship between government

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.000
and local social networking companies

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.000
is creating a situation

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.000
where, effectively,

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:50.000
the empowering potential of these platforms

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000
is being constrained

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000
because of these relationships

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.000
between companies and government.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.000
Now in China,

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000
you have the "great firewall," as it's well-known,

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000
that blocks Facebook

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:05.000
and Twitter and now Google+

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:08.000
and many of the other overseas websites.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:11.000
And that's done in part with the help from Western technology.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:14.000
But that's only half of the story.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.000
The other part of the story

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:19.000
are requirements that the Chinese government places

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:22.000
on all companies operating on the Chinese Internet,

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.000
known as a system of self-discipline.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.000
In plain English, that means censorship and surveillance

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.000
of their users.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:32.000
And this is a ceremony I actually attended in 2009

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:35.000
where the Internet Society of China presented awards

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:38.000
to the top 20 Chinese companies

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:41.000
that are best at exercising self-discipline --

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.000
i.e. policing their content.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:46.000
And Robin Li, CEO of Baidu,

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.000
China's dominant search engine,

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.000
was one of the recipients.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:55.000
In Russia, they do not generally block the Internet

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.000
and directly censor websites.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.000
But this is a website called Rospil

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.000
that's an anti-corruption site.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.000
And earlier this year,

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.000
there was a troubling incident

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:08.000
where people who had made donations to Rospil

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.000
through a payments processing system

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.000
called Yandex Money

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.000
suddenly received threatening phone calls

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:17.000
from members of a nationalist party

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.000
who had obtained details

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:22.000
about donors to Rospil

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.000
through members of the security services

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:27.000
who had somehow obtained this information

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:30.000
from people at Yandex Money.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.000
This has a chilling effect

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.000
on people's ability to use the Internet

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:37.000
to hold government accountable.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.000
So we have a situation in the world today

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.000
where in more and more countries

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:44.000
the relationship between citizens and governments

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:47.000
is mediated through the Internet,

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.000
which is comprised primarily

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:53.000
of privately owned and operated services.

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.000
So the important question, I think,

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.000
is not this debate over whether the Internet

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:00.000
is going to help the good guys more than the bad guys.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.000
Of course, it's going to empower

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:05.000
whoever is most skilled at using the technology

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.000
and best understands the Internet

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:10.000
in comparison with whoever their adversary is.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:13.000
The most urgent question we need to be asking today

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.000
is how do we make sure

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:17.000
that the Internet evolves

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:20.000
in a citizen-centric manner.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.000
Because I think all of you will agree

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:25.000
that the only legitimate purpose of government

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.000
is to serve citizens,

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.000
and I would argue

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.000
that the only legitimate purpose of technology

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:33.000
is to improve our lives,

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:37.000
not to manipulate or enslave us.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.000
So the question is,

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.000
we know how to hold government accountable.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.000
We don't necessarily always do it very well,

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:47.000
but we have a sense of what the models are,

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.000
politically and institutionally, to do that.

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.000
How do you hold the sovereigns of cyberspace

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:53.000
accountable to the public interest

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.000
when most CEO's argue

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.000
that their main obligation

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.000
is to maximize shareholder profit?

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.000
And government regulation

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:03.000
often isn't helping all that much.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:05.000
You have situations, for instance, in France

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:07.000
where president Sarkozy

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.000
tells the CEO's of Internet companies,

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.000
"We're the only legitimate representatives

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.000
of the public interest."

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.000
But then he goes and champions laws

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.000
like the infamous "three-strikes" law

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.000
that would disconnect citizens from the Internet

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.000
for file sharing,

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:24.000
which has been condemned by the U.N. Special Rapporteur

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.000
on Freedom of Expression

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:29.000
as being a disproportionate violation

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.000
of citizens' right to communications,

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:34.000
and has raised questions amongst civil society groups

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.000
about whether

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.000
some political representatives

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.000
are more interested in preserving

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:43.000
the interests of the entertainment industry

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.000
than they are in defending the rights of their citizens.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:47.000
And here in the United Kingdom

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.000
there's also concern over

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.000
a law called the Digital Economy Act

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.000
that's placing more onus

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.000
on private intermediaries

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:59.000
to police citizen behavior.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.000
So what we need to recognize

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.000
is that if we want to have

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:06.000
a citizen-centric Internet in the future,

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.000
we need a broader and more sustained

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.000
Internet freedom movement.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:13.000
After all, companies didn't stop polluting groundwater

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:16.000
as a matter of course,

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.000
or employing 10-year-olds as a matter of course,

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.000
just because executives woke up one day

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:23.000
and decided it was the right thing to do.

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:25.000
It was the result of decades of sustained activism,

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.000
shareholder advocacy

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:29.000
and consumer advocacy.

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:33.000
Similarly, governments don't enact

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:36.000
intelligent environmental and labor laws

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:39.000
just because politicians wake up one day.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:41.000
It's the result of very sustained and prolonged

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.000
political activism

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:45.000
that you get the right regulations,

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:47.000
and that you get the right corporate behavior.

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:49.000
We need to make the same approach

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:51.000
with the Internet.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.000
We also are going to need

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.000
political innovation.

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:58.000
Eight hundred years ago, approximately,

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.000
the barons of England decided

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.000
that the Divine Right of Kings

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:05.000
was no longer working for them so well,

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:07.000
and they forced King John

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:10.000
to sign the Magna Carta,

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.000
which recognized

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.000
that even the king

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:17.000
who claimed to have divine rule

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:20.000
still had to abide by a basic set of rules.

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:23.000
This set off a cycle

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:25.000
of what we can call political innovation,

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:28.000
which led eventually to the idea of consent of the governed --

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:31.000
which was implemented for the first time

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:34.000
by that radical revolutionary government

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:37.000
in America across the pond.

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:40.000
So now we need to figure out

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:42.000
how to build consent of the networked.

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.000
And what does that look like?

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:47.000
At the moment, we still don't know.

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:51.000
But it's going to require innovation

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:54.000
that's not only going to need

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.000
to focus on politics,

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:58.000
on geopolitics,

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:00.000
but it's also going to need

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:03.000
to deal with questions

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:06.000
of business management, investor behavior,

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:08.000
consumer choice

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:12.000
and even software design and engineering.

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:15.000
Each and every one of us has a vital part to play

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:18.000
in building the kind of world

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:21.000
in which government and technology

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:24.000
serve the world's people and not the other way around.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.000
Thank you very much.

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:31.000
(Applause)
