00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Have you ever wondered

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
why extremism seems to have been on the rise in Muslim-majority countries

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
over the course of the last decade?

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Have you ever wondered

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
how such a situation can be turned around?

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Have you ever looked at the Arab uprisings

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
and thought, "How could we have predicted that?"

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
or "How could we have better prepared for that?"

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Well my personal story, my personal journey,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
what brings me to the TED stage here today,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
is a demonstration of exactly what's been happening

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
in Muslim-majority countries

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
over the course of the last decades, at least, and beyond.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
I want to share some of that story with you,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
but also some of my ideas around change

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
and the role of social movements in creating change

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
in Muslim-majority societies.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
So let me begin

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
by first of all giving a very, very brief history of time,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
if I may indulge.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
In medieval societies there were defined allegiances.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
An identity was defined

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
primarily by religion.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
And then we moved on into an era in the 19th century

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
with the rise of a European nation-state

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
where identities and allegiances were defined

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
by ethnicity.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
So identity was primarily defined by ethnicity,

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
and the nation-state reflected that.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
In the age of globalization, we moved on.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
I call it the era of citizenship --

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
where people could be from multi-racial, multi-ethnic backgrounds,

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
but all be equal as citizens

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
in a state.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
You could be American-Italian; you could be American-Irish;

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
you could be British-Pakistani.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
But I believe now

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
that we're moving into a new age,

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
and that age The New York Times dubbed recently

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
as "the age of behavior."

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
How I define the age of behavior

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
is a period of transnational allegiances,

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
where identity is defined more so

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
by ideas and narratives.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
And these ideas and narratives that bump people across borders

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
are increasingly beginning to affect

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
the way in which people behave.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
Now this is not all necessarily good news,

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
because it's also my belief

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
that hatred has gone global

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000
just as much as love.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
But actually it's my belief

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
that the people who've been truly capitalizing on this age of behavior,

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
up until now, up until recent times,

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
up until the last six months,

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
the people who have been capitalizing most

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
on the age of behavior

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
and the transnational allegiances,

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
using digital activism

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
and other sorts of borderless technologies,

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
those who've been benefiting from this

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000
have been extremists.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
And that's something which I'd like to elaborate on.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
If we look at Islamists,

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
if we look at the phenomenon

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
of far-right fascists,

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
one thing they've been very good at,

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
one thing that they've actually been exceeding in,

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
is communicating across borders,

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
using technologies to organize themselves,

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000
to propagate their message

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000
and to create truly global phenomena.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
Now I should know,

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
because for 13 years of my life,

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.000
I was involved in an extreme Islamist organization.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000
And I was actually a potent force

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000
in spreading ideas across borders,

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000
and I witnessed the rise of Islamist extremism

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000
as distinct from Islam the faith,

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000
and the way in which it influenced my co-religionists

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
across the world.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
And my story, my personal story,

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
is truly evidence for the age of behavior

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000
that I'm attempting to elaborate upon here.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
I was, by the way -- I'm an Essex lad,

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
born and raised in Essex in the U.K.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
Anyone who's from England

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
knows the reputation we have from Essex.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
But having been born in Essex,

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000
at the age of 16,

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000
I joined an organization.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000
At the age of 17, I was recruiting people from Cambridge University

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000
to this organization.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000
At the age of 19,

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.000
I was on the national leadership of this organization in the U.K.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.000
At the age of 21, I was co-founding this organization in Pakistan.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000
At the age of 22,

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000
I was co-founding this organization in Denmark.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000
By the age of 24,

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.000
I found myself convicted in prison in Egypt,

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000
being blacklisted from three countries in the world

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.000
for attempting to overthrow their governments,

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000
being subjected to torture

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000
in Egyptian jails

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.000
and sentenced to five years as a prisoner of conscience.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000
Now that journey,

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.000
and what took me from Essex all the way across the world --

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.000
by the way, we were laughing at democratic activists.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000
We felt they were from the age of yesteryear.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000
We felt that they were out of date.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.000
I learned how to use email

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.000
from the extremist organization that I used.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000
I learned how to effectively communicate across borders

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000
without being detected.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000
Eventually I was detected, of course, in Egypt.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000
But the way in which I learned

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000
to use technology to my advantage

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.000
was because I was within an extremist organization

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000
that was forced to think beyond

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000
the confines of the nation-state.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000
The age of behavior: where ideas and narratives

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.000
were increasingly defining behavior

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000
and identity and allegiances.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000
So as I said, we looked to the status quo

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000
and ridiculed it.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000
And it's not just Islamist extremists that did this.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000
But even if you look across

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000
the mood music in Europe of late,

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000
far-right fascism is also on the rise.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000
A form of anti-Islam rhetoric

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000
is also on the rise

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000
and it's transnational.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.000
And the consequences that this is having

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.000
is that it's affecting the political climate

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000
across Europe.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000
What's actually happening

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.000
is that what were previously localized parochialisms,

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.000
individual or groupings of extremists

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000
who were isolated from one another,

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.000
have become interconnected in a globalized way

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.000
and have thus become, or are becoming, mainstream.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.000
Because the Internet and connection technologies

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.000
are connecting them across the world.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.000
If you look at the rise of far-right fascism across Europe of late,

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.000
you will see some things that are happening

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000
that are influencing domestic politics,

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.000
yet the phenomenon is transnational.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.000
In certain countries, mosque minarets are being banned.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000
In others, headscarves are being banned.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.000
In others, kosher and halal meat are being banned,

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000
as we speak.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.000
And on the flip side,

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.000
we have transnational Islamist extremists

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.000
doing the same thing across their own societies.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.000
And so they are pockets of parochialism that are being connected

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.000
in a way that makes them feel like they are mainstream.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000
Now that never would have been possible before.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.000
They would have felt isolated,

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.000
until these sorts of technologies came around

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.000
and connected them in a way

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.000
that made them feel part of a larger phenomenon.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:28.000
Where does that leave democracy aspirants?

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.000
Well I believe they're getting left far behind.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:34.000
And I'll give you an example here at this stage.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.000
If any of you remembers the Christmas Day bomb plot:

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:40.000
there's a man called Anwar al-Awlaki.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000
As an American citizen, ethnically a Yemeni,

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000
in hiding currently in Yemen,

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.000
who inspired a Nigerian,

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.000
son of the head of Nigeria's national bank.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.000
This Nigerian student studied in London, trained in Yemen,

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.000
boarded a flight in Amsterdam to attack America.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000
In the meanwhile,

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.000
the Old mentality with a capital O,

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:01.000
was represented by his father, the head of the Nigerian bank,

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:04.000
warning the CIA that his own son was about to attack,

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.000
and this warning fell on deaf ears.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.000
The Old mentality with a capital O,

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000
as represented by the nation-state,

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.000
not yet fully into the age of behavior,

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:16.000
not recognizing the power of transnational social movements,

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.000
got left behind.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.000
And the Christmas Day bomber almost succeeded

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:23.000
in attacking the United States of America.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.000
Again with the example of the far right:

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000
that we find, ironically,

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:34.000
xenophobic nationalists

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:37.000
are utilizing the benefits of globalization.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.000
So why are they succeeding?

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.000
And why are democracy aspirants falling behind?

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:45.000
Well we need to understand the power of the social movements who understand this.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.000
And a social movement is comprised, in my view,

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.000
it's comprised of four main characteristics.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000
It's comprised of ideas and narratives

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000
and symbols and leaders.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.000
I'll talk you through one example,

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:59.000
and that's the example that everyone here will be aware of,

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:02.000
and that's the example of Al-Qaeda.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000
If I asked you to think of the ideas of Al-Qaeda,

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.000
that's something that comes to your mind immediately.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.000
If I ask you to think of their narratives --

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:11.000
the West being at war with Islam, the need to defend Islam against the West --

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:14.000
these narratives, they come to your mind immediately.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:17.000
Incidentally, the difference between ideas and narratives:

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:20.000
the idea is the cause that one believes in;

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:23.000
and the narrative is the way to sell that cause --

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:26.000
the propaganda, if you like, of the cause.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:29.000
So the ideas and the narratives of Al-Qaeda come to your mind immediately.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000
If I ask you to think of their symbols and their leaders,

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.000
they come to your mind immediately.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.000
One of their leaders was killed in Pakistan recently.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.000
So these symbols and these leaders

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.000
come to your mind immediately.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.000
And that's the power of social movements.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:44.000
They're transnational, and they bond around these ideas and narratives

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:47.000
and these symbols and these leaders.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.000
However,

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:52.000
if I ask your minds to focus currently on Pakistan,

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:55.000
and I ask you to think

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.000
of the symbols and the leaders for democracy

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.000
in Pakistan today,

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.000
you'll be hard pressed

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.000
to think beyond perhaps

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.000
the assassination of Benazir Bhutto.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.000
Which means, by definition,

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:10.000
that particular leader no longer exists.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:13.000
One of the problems we're facing is, in my view,

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.000
that there are no globalized,

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:18.000
youth-led, grassroots social movements

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.000
advocating for democratic culture

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.000
across Muslim-majority societies.

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:25.000
There is no equivalent of the Al-Qaeda, without the terrorism,

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:28.000
for democracy across Muslim-majority societies.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:31.000
There are no ideas and narratives and leaders and symbols

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:34.000
advocating the democratic culture on the ground.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:38.000
So that begs the next question.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:41.000
Why is it that extremist organizations,

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:44.000
whether of the far-right or of the Islamist extremism --

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.000
Islamism meaning those who wish to impose

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.000
one version of Islam over the rest of society --

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.000
why is it that they are succeeding

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.000
in organizing in a globalized way,

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.000
whereas those who aspire to democratic culture

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.000
are falling behind?

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:59.000
And I believe that's for four reasons.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:02.000
I believe, number one, it's complacency.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.000
Because those who aspire to democratic culture

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.000
are in power,

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.000
or have societies

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.000
that are leading globalized, powerful societies,

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.000
powerful countries.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.000
And that level of complacency means

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:17.000
they don't feel the need to advocate for that culture.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.000
The second, I believe,

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:22.000
is political correctness.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:26.000
That we have a hesitation

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:29.000
in espousing the universality of democratic culture

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.000
because we are associating that --

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:34.000
we associate believing in the universality of our values --

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.000
with extremists.

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.000
Yet actually, whenever we talk about human rights,

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:41.000
we do say that human rights are universal.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.000
But actually going out to propagate that view

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:47.000
is associated with either neoconservativism

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.000
or with Islamist extremism.

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.000
To go around saying that I believe

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:54.000
democratic culture is the best that we've arrived at

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:57.000
as a form of political organizing

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.000
is associated with extremism.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.000
And the third,

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:03.000
democratic choice in Muslim-majority societies

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:06.000
has been relegated to a political choice,

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:09.000
meaning political parties

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:13.000
in many of these societies

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.000
ask people to vote for them

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.000
as the democratic party,

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.000
but then the other parties ask them to vote for them

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.000
as the military party --

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.000
wanting to rule by military dictatorship.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.000
And then you have a third party saying,

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.000
"Vote for us; we'll establish a theocracy."

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:30.000
So democracy has become merely one political choice

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.000
among many other forms

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:35.000
of political choices available in those societies.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:37.000
And what happens as a result of this

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.000
is, when those parties are elected,

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.000
and inevitably they fail,

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:43.000
or inevitably they make political mistakes,

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.000
democracy takes the blame

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:47.000
for their political mistakes.

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:50.000
And then people say, "We've tried democracy. It doesn't really work.

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.000
Let's bring the military back again."

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.000
And the fourth reason, I believe,

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:57.000
is what I've labeled here on the slide as the ideology of resistance.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.000
What I mean by that is,

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.000
if the world superpower today was a communist,

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.000
it would be much easier for democracy activists

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:05.000
to use democracy activism

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:07.000
as a form of resistance against colonialism,

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:10.000
than it is today with the world superpower being America,

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.000
occupying certain lands

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.000
and also espousing democratic ideals.

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.000
So roughly these four reasons

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:19.000
make it a lot more difficult for democratic culture to spread

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:21.000
as a civilizational choice,

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:24.000
not merely as a political choice.

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:26.000
When talking about those reasons,

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.000
let's break down certain preconceptions.

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.000
Is it just about grievances?

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:33.000
Is it just about a lack of education?

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:35.000
Well statistically,

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:38.000
the majority of those who join extremist organizations are highly educated.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.000
Statistically, they are educated, on average,

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:42.000
above the education levels

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:44.000
of Western society.

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:46.000
Anecdotally, we can demonstrate

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.000
that if poverty was the only factor,

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:51.000
well Bin Laden is from one of the richest families in Saudi Arabia.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:54.000
His deputy, Ayman al-Zawahiri, was a pediatrician --

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.000
not an ill-educated man.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:59.000
International aid and development has been going on for years,

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.000
but extremism in those societies, in many of those societies,

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:03.000
has been on the rise.

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:05.000
And what I believe is missing

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:07.000
is genuine grassroots activism

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:09.000
on the ground,

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:11.000
in addition to international aid,

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:14.000
in addition to education, in addition to health.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:17.000
Not exclusive to these things, but in addition to them,

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:20.000
is propagating a genuine demand for democracy on the ground.

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.000
And this is where I believe

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.000
neoconservatism had it upside-down.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.000
Neoconservatism had the philosophy

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:29.000
that you go in with a supply-led approach

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:32.000
to impose democratic values from the top down.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:35.000
Whereas Islamists and far-right organizations, for decades,

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:38.000
have been building demand for their ideology on the grassroots.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.000
They've been building civilizational demand for their values

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:42.000
on the grassroots,

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:45.000
and we've been seeing those societies slowly transition

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:48.000
to societies that are increasingly asking for

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.000
a form of Islamism.

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.000
Mass movements in Pakistan

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:54.000
have been represented after the Arab uprisings

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.000
mainly by organizations

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:58.000
claiming for some form of theocracy,

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:00.000
rather than for a democratic uprising.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.000
Because since pre-partition,

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:05.000
they've been building demand for their ideology on the ground.

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:07.000
And what's needed is a genuine transnational

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:09.000
youth-led movement

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:11.000
that works to actively advocate

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:13.000
for the democratic culture --

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:15.000
which is necessarily more

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:17.000
than just elections.

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:20.000
But without freedom of speech, you can't have free and fair elections.

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:23.000
Without human rights, you don't have the protection granted to you to campaign.

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:25.000
Without freedom of belief,

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:27.000
you don't have the right to join organizations.

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:29.000
So what's needed is those organizations on the ground

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:34.000
advocating for the democratic culture itself

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:37.000
to create the demand on the ground for this culture.

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:40.000
What that will do

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:43.000
is avoid the problem I was talking about earlier,

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:46.000
where currently we have political parties presenting democracy

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:49.000
as merely a political choice in those societies

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:51.000
alongside other choices

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:53.000
such as military rule and theocracy.

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:56.000
Whereas if we start building this demand on the ground on a civilizational level,

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:58.000
rather than merely on a political level,

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:01.000
a level above politics --

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.000
movements that are not political parties,

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:05.000
but are rather creating this civilizational demand

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:07.000
for this democratic culture.

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:09.000
What we'll have in the end

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:11.000
is this ideal that you see on the slide here --

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:15.000
the ideal that people should vote in an existing democracy,

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:17.000
not for a democracy.

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:19.000
But to get to that stage,

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:22.000
where democracy builds the fabric of society

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:24.000
and the political choices within that fabric,

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:29.000
but are certainly not theocratic and military dictatorship --

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:31.000
i.e. you're voting in a democracy,

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:33.000
in an existing democracy,

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:36.000
and that democracy is not merely one of the choices at the ballot box.

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:38.000
To get to that stage,

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:41.000
we genuinely need to start building demand

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:44.000
in those societies on the ground.

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:49.000
Now to conclude, how does that happen?

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:51.000
Well, Egypt is a good starting point.

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:54.000
The Arab uprisings have demonstrated that this is already beginning.

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:57.000
But what happened in the Arab uprisings and what happened in Egypt

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:00.000
was particularly cathartic for me.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:03.000
What happened there was a political coalition

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:05.000
gathered together for a political goal,

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:07.000
and that was to remove the leader.

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:09.000
We need to move one step beyond that now.

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:11.000
We need to see how we can help those societies

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:13.000
move from political coalitions,

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:15.000
loosely based political coalitions,

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:17.000
to civilizational coalitions

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:19.000
that are working for the ideals and narratives

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:21.000
of the democratic culture on the ground.

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:23.000
Because it's not enough to remove a leader

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:25.000
or ruler or dictator.

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:27.000
That doesn't guarantee that what comes next

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:31.000
will be a society built on democratic values.

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:33.000
But generally, the trends that start in Egypt

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:35.000
have historically spread across the MENA region,

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:37.000
the Middle East and North Africa region.

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:40.000
So when Arab socialism started in Egypt, it spread across the region.

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:43.000
In the '80s and '90s when Islamism started in the region,

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:46.000
it spread across the MENA region as a whole.

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:48.000
And the aspiration that we have at the moment --

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:50.000
as young Arabs are proving today

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:52.000
and instantly rebranding themselves

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:55.000
as being prepared to die for more than just terrorism --

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:58.000
is that there is a chance

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:00.000
that democratic culture can start in the region

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:02.000
and spread across to the rest of the countries that are surrounding that.

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:04.000
But that will require

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:06.000
helping these societies transition

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:08.000
from having merely political coalitions

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:11.000
to building genuinely grassroots-based social movements

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:13.000
that advocate for the democratic culture.

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:16.000
And we've made a start for that in Pakistan

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:18.000
with a movement called Khudi,

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:21.000
where we are working on the ground to encourage the youth

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:24.000
to create genuine buy-in for the democratic culture.

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:26.000
And it's with that thought that I'll end.

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:28.000
And my time is up, and thank you for your time.

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:31.000
(Applause)
