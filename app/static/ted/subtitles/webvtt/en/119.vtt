00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Has anyone ever been to Aspen, Colorado?

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:08.000
It's not a joke yet;

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
those aren't the jokes.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Is this thing off?

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
I went to Aspen recently

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
and stumbled into this song.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
♫ Black men go to Aspen ♫

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
♫ and rent colorful chalets. ♫

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
♫ Giggle at the questions ♫

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.000
♫ their mere presence seems to raise. ♫

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
♫ Get taken for men ♫

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.000
♫ we don't resemble in the least. ♫

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
"Are you ... ?"

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
"No."

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
♫ It's a winter wonderland ♫

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
♫ in the belly of the beast. ♫

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.000
♫ And black men ski. ♫

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.000
♫ Black men ski. ♫

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
♫ Black men send back sushi ♫

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.000
♫ with a scorned Yakuza's flair. ♫

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
♫ We make postmodern art ♫

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
♫ with bacon grease ♫

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
♫ and hot combed hair. ♫

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
♫ We secretly play Beethoven ♫

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
♫ inside our bassmobiles. ♫

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000
♫ We can tell you how cool looks ♫

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
♫ but cannot show you how it feels ♫

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.000
♫ when black men ski. ♫

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:14.000
♫ When black men ski. ♫

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
♫ Black men now are students ♫

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000
♫ of gay sensibility. ♫

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000
♫ We wear ironic T-shirts ♫

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000
♫ drenched in code unknown to thee. ♫

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000
♫ We get baptized in Walden Pond ♫

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
♫ amongst a searing mob ♫

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
♫ because the cleansing blood of Jesus ♫

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
♫ could not do a thorough job. ♫

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.000
♫ Black men ski. ♫

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
♫ Black men ski. ♫

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000
♫ Chinese guys can jump real high ♫

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000
♫ and Germans cook soul food. ♫

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000
♫ White boys rap and hippies nap ♫

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
♫ their dreads up to look rude. ♫

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000
♫ Jazz is now suburban ♫

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000
♫ it's Marsalisly clean. ♫

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000
♫ And now we've got Viagra ♫

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
♫ everyone's a sex machine. ♫

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:14.000
♫ So black men ski. ♫

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.000
What else can we do?

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.000
♫ Black men ski. ♫

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.000
♫ Black men ski. ♫

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:31.000
♫ Black men ski. ♫

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000
♫ Some kids I'll describe as friends ♫

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000
♫ say I am race-obsessed. ♫

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000
♫ The luxury of your opinion ♫

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.000
♫ shows that you are blessed. ♫

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.000
♫ See, I have poems about sunsets ♫

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.000
♫ flowers and the rain. ♫

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.000
♫ I've read them to policemen ♫

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000
♫ but it was all in vain. ♫

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.000
♫ So black men ski. ♫

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.000
♫ Black men ski ... ♫

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:05.000
elegantly.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:10.000
♫ Black men ski. ♫

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:19.000
♫ Black men ski. ♫
