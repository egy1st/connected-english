00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
It's the Second World War.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
A German prison camp.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
And this man,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Archie Cochrane,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
is a prisoner of war and a doctor,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
and he has a problem.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
The problem is that the men under his care

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
are suffering

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
from an excruciating and debilitating condition

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
that Archie doesn't really understand.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
The symptoms

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
are this horrible swelling up of fluids under the skin.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
But he doesn't know whether it's an infection, whether it's to do with malnutrition.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
He doesn't know how to cure it.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
And he's operating in a hostile environment.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
And people do terrible things in wars.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
The German camp guards, they've got bored.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
They've taken to just firing into the prison camp at random

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
for fun.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
On one particular occasion,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
one of the guards threw a grenade into the prisoners' lavatory

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
while it was full of prisoners.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
He said he heard suspicious laughter.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
And Archie Cochrane, as the camp doctor,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
was one of the first men in

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
to clear up the mess.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
And one more thing:

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
Archie was suffering from this illness himself.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
So the situation seemed pretty desperate.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
But Archie Cochrane

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
was a resourceful person.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
He'd already smuggled vitamin C into the camp,

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
and now he managed

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
to get hold of supplies of marmite

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
on the black market.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
Now some of you will be wondering what marmite is.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000
Marmite is a breakfast spread beloved of the British.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
It looks like crude oil.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
It tastes ...

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
zesty.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
And importantly,

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
it's a rich source

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
of vitamin B12.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
So Archie splits the men under his care as best he can

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
into two equal groups.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
He gives half of them vitamin C.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
He gives half of them vitamin B12.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
He very carefully and meticulously notes his results

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
in an exercise book.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
And after just a few days,

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
it becomes clear

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
that whatever is causing this illness,

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
marmite is the cure.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
So Cochrane then goes to the Germans who are running the prison camp.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
Now you've got to imagine at the moment --

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
forget this photo, imagine this guy

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000
with this long ginger beard and this shock of red hair.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000
He hasn't been able to shave -- a sort of Billy Connolly figure.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
Cochrane, he starts ranting at these Germans

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
in this Scottish accent --

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
in fluent German, by the way, but in a Scottish accent --

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000
and explains to them how German culture was the culture

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
that gave Schiller and Goethe to the world.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
And he can't understand

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
how this barbarism can be tolerated,

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000
and he vents his frustrations.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000
And then he goes back to his quarters,

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000
breaks down and weeps

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000
because he's convinced that the situation is hopeless.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000
But a young German doctor

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000
picks up Archie Cochrane's exercise book

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.000
and says to his colleagues,

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:10.000
"This evidence is incontrovertible.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000
If we don't supply vitamins to the prisoners,

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
it's a war crime."

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
And the next morning,

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000
supplies of vitamin B12 are delivered to the camp,

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.000
and the prisoners begin to recover.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
Now I'm not telling you this story

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
because I think Archie Cochrane is a dude,

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.000
although Archie Cochrane is a dude.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000
I'm not even telling you the story

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000
because I think we should be running

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000
more carefully controlled randomized trials

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000
in all aspects of public policy,

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.000
although I think that would also be completely awesome.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000
I'm telling you this story

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.000
because Archie Cochrane, all his life,

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.000
fought against a terrible affliction,

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:57.000
and he realized it was debilitating to individuals

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
and it was corrosive to societies.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
And he had a name for it.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.000
He called it the God complex.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.000
Now I can describe the symptoms of the God complex very, very easily.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.000
So the symptoms of the complex

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.000
are, no matter how complicated the problem,

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.000
you have an absolutely overwhelming belief

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:21.000
that you are infallibly right in your solution.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000
Now Archie was a doctor,

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.000
so he hung around with doctors a lot.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.000
And doctors suffer from the God complex a lot.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
Now I'm an economist, I'm not a doctor,

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
but I see the God complex around me all the time

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000
in my fellow economists.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000
I see it in our business leaders.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000
I see it in the politicians we vote for --

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:42.000
people who, in the face of an incredibly complicated world,

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.000
are nevertheless absolutely convinced

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000
that they understand the way that the world works.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.000
And you know, with the future billions that we've been hearing about,

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000
the world is simply far too complex

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000
to understand in that way.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000
Well let me give you an example.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000
Imagine for a moment

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000
that, instead of Tim Harford in front of you,

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.000
there was Hans Rosling presenting his graphs.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000
You know Hans:

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000
the Mick Jagger of TED.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000
(Laughter)

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000
And he'd be showing you these amazing statistics,

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000
these amazing animations.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000
And they are brilliant; it's wonderful work.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000
But a typical Hans Rosling graph:

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.000
think for a moment, not what it shows,

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.000
but think instead about what it leaves out.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.000
So it'll show you GDP per capita,

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000
population, longevity,

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000
that's about it.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.000
So three pieces of data for each country --

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.000
three pieces of data.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000
Three pieces of data is nothing.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000
I mean, have a look at this graph.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000
This is produced by the physicist Cesar Hidalgo.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000
He's at MIT.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000
Now you won't be able to understand a word of it,

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000
but this is what it looks like.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.000
Cesar has trolled the database

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.000
of over 5,000 different products,

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:57.000
and he's used techniques of network analysis

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.000
to interrogate this database

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000
and to graph relationships between the different products.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.000
And it's wonderful, wonderful work.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.000
You show all these interconnections, all these interrelations.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000
And I think it'll be profoundly useful

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.000
in understanding how it is that economies grow.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.000
Brilliant work.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000
Cesar and I tried to write a piece for The New York Times Magazine

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000
explaining how this works.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.000
And what we learned

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.000
is Cesar's work is far too good to explain

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.000
in The New York Times Magazine.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:28.000
Five thousand products --

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000
that's still nothing.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000
Five thousand products --

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000
imagine counting every product category

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000
in Cesar Hidalgo's data.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.000
Imagine you had one second

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.000
per product category.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:43.000
In about the length of this session,

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.000
you would have counted all 5,000.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000
Now imagine doing the same thing

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.000
for every different type of product on sale in Walmart.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.000
There are 100,000 there. It would take you all day.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000
Now imagine trying to count

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.000
every different specific product and service

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000
on sale in a major economy

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000
such as Tokyo, London or New York.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000
It's even more difficult in Edinburgh

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:07.000
because you have to count all the whisky and the tartan.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000
If you wanted to count every product and service

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000
on offer in New York --

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.000
there are 10 billion of them --

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:16.000
it would take you 317 years.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:19.000
This is how complex the economy we've created is.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.000
And I'm just counting toasters here.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.000
I'm not trying to solve the Middle East problem.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.000
The complexity here is unbelievable.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000
And just a piece of context --

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000
the societies in which our brains evolved

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.000
had about 300 products and services.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:36.000
You could count them in five minutes.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.000
So this is the complexity of the world that surrounds us.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.000
This perhaps is why

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:44.000
we find the God complex so tempting.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:47.000
We tend to retreat and say, "We can draw a picture,

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.000
we can post some graphs,

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:52.000
we get it, we understand how this works."

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000
And we don't.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.000
We never do.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.000
Now I'm not trying to deliver a nihilistic message here.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000
I'm not trying to say we can't solve

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000
complicated problems in a complicated world.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000
We clearly can.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.000
But the way we solve them

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.000
is with humility --

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.000
to abandon the God complex

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:13.000
and to actually use a problem-solving technique that works.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:16.000
And we have a problem-solving technique that works.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.000
Now you show me

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.000
a successful complex system,

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:23.000
and I will show you a system

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.000
that has evolved through trial and error.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.000
Here's an example.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:30.000
This baby was produced through trial and error.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:34.000
I realize that's an ambiguous statement.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.000
Maybe I should clarify it.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.000
This baby is a human body: it evolved.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.000
What is evolution?

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:44.000
Over millions of years, variation and selection,

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:47.000
variation and selection --

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.000
trial and error,

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:52.000
trial and error.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.000
And it's not just biological systems

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.000
that produce miracles through trial and error.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.000
You could use it in an industrial context.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.000
So let's say you wanted to make detergent.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000
Let's say you're Unilever

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:05.000
and you want to make detergent in a factory near Liverpool.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.000
How do you do it?

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:10.000
Well you have this great big tank full of liquid detergent.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.000
You pump it at a high pressure through a nozzle.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.000
You create a spray of detergent.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.000
Then the spray dries. It turns into powder.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.000
It falls to the floor.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.000
You scoop it up. You put it in cardboard boxes.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.000
You sell it at a supermarket.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.000
You make lots of money.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:28.000
How do you design that nozzle?

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:31.000
It turns out to be very important.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.000
Now if you ascribe to the God complex,

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:36.000
what you do is you find yourself a little God.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.000
You find yourself a mathematician; you find yourself a physicist --

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:42.000
somebody who understands the dynamics of this fluid.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.000
And he will, or she will,

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:48.000
calculate the optimal design of the nozzle.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.000
Now Unilever did this and it didn't work --

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.000
too complicated.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:55.000
Even this problem, too complicated.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:58.000
But the geneticist Professor Steve Jones

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:01.000
describes how Unilever actually did solve this problem --

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.000
trial and error,

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.000
variation and selection.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.000
You take a nozzle

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:11.000
and you create 10 random variations on the nozzle.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:14.000
You try out all 10; you keep the one that works best.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.000
You create 10 variations on that one.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:19.000
You try out all 10. You keep the one that works best.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.000
You try out 10 variations on that one.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.000
You see how this works, right?

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.000
And after 45 generations,

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.000
you have this incredible nozzle.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.000
It looks a bit like a chess piece --

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:32.000
functions absolutely brilliantly.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.000
We have no idea

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.000
why it works,

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.000
no idea at all.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.000
And the moment you step back from the God complex --

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.000
let's just try to have a bunch of stuff;

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:45.000
let's have a systematic way of determining what's working and what's not --

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.000
you can solve your problem.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.000
Now this process of trial and error

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:52.000
is actually far more common in successful institutions

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:54.000
than we care to recognize.

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:57.000
And we've heard a lot about how economies function.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:01.000
The U.S. economy is still the world's greatest economy.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:04.000
How did it become the world's greatest economy?

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:06.000
I could give you all kinds of facts and figures

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.000
about the U.S. economy,

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:11.000
but I think the most salient one is this:

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:14.000
ten percent of American businesses

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:17.000
disappear every year.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:20.000
That is a huge failure rate.

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.000
It's far higher than the failure rate of, say, Americans.

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:25.000
Ten percent of Americans don't disappear every year.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.000
Which leads us to conclude

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:30.000
American businesses fail faster than Americans,

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:33.000
and therefore American businesses are evolving faster than Americans.

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:36.000
And eventually, they'll have evolved to such a high peak of perfection

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:39.000
that they will make us all their pets --

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.000
(Laughter)

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:44.000
if, of course, they haven't already done so.

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:47.000
I sometimes wonder.

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.000
But it's this process of trial and error

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:53.000
that explains this great divergence,

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:56.000
this incredible performance of Western economies.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:59.000
It didn't come because you put some incredibly smart person in charge.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.000
It's come through trial and error.

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.000
Now I've been sort of banging on about this

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:05.000
for the last couple of months,

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:07.000
and people sometimes say to me,

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:09.000
"Well Tim, it's kind of obvious.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:11.000
Obviously trial and error is very important.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.000
Obviously experimentation is very important.

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:16.000
Now why are you just wandering around saying this obvious thing?"

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.000
So I say, okay, fine.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.000
You think it's obvious?

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.000
I will admit it's obvious

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:24.000
when schools

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:27.000
start teaching children

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:30.000
that there are some problems that don't have a correct answer.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:33.000
Stop giving them lists of questions

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:35.000
every single one of which has an answer.

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:37.000
And there's an authority figure in the corner

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.000
behind the teacher's desk who knows all the answers.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:41.000
And if you can't find the answers,

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.000
you must be lazy or stupid.

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:45.000
When schools stop doing that all the time,

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:47.000
I will admit that, yes,

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:49.000
it's obvious that trial and error is a good thing.

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:52.000
When a politician stands up

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.000
campaigning for elected office

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.000
and says, "I want to fix our health system.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.000
I want to fix our education system.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:01.000
I have no idea how to do it.

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:03.000
I have half a dozen ideas.

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:06.000
We're going to test them out. They'll probably all fail.

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.000
Then we'll test some other ideas out.

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:10.000
We'll find some that work. We'll build on those.

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.000
We'll get rid of the ones that don't." --

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:15.000
when a politician campaigns on that platform,

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:18.000
and more importantly, when voters like you and me

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:20.000
are willing to vote for that kind of politician,

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.000
then I will admit

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:25.000
that it is obvious that trial and error works, and that -- thank you.

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:29.000
(Applause)

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:32.000
Until then, until then

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.000
I'm going to keep banging on about trial and error

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:37.000
and why we should abandon the God complex.

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:40.000
Because it's so hard

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:42.000
to admit our own fallibility.

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.000
It's so uncomfortable.

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:47.000
And Archie Cochrane understood this as well as anybody.

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:49.000
There's this one trial he ran

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:51.000
many years after World War II.

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:54.000
He wanted to test out

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.000
the question of, where is it

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:58.000
that patients should recover

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:00.000
from heart attacks?

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:03.000
Should they recover in a specialized cardiac unit in hospital,

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:06.000
or should they recover at home?

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:09.000
All the cardiac doctors tried to shut him down.

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:12.000
They had the God complex in spades.

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:15.000
They knew that their hospitals were the right place for patients,

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:17.000
and they knew it was very unethical

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:20.000
to run any kind of trial or experiment.

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:22.000
Nevertheless, Archie managed to get permission to do this.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:24.000
He ran his trial.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.000
And after the trial had been running for a little while,

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.000
he gathered together all his colleagues

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.000
around his table,

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.000
and he said, "Well, gentlemen,

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.000
we have some preliminary results.

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:36.000
They're not statistically significant.

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:39.000
But we have something.

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:42.000
And it turns out that you're right and I'm wrong.

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:44.000
It is dangerous for patients

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.000
to recover from heart attacks at home.

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:49.000
They should be in hospital."

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:51.000
And there's this uproar, and all the doctors start pounding the table

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:54.000
and saying, "We always said you were unethical, Archie.

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:57.000
You're killing people with your clinical trials. You need to shut it down now.

00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:59.000
Shut it down at once."

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:01.000
And there's this huge hubbub.

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.000
Archie lets it die down.

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:05.000
And then he says, "Well that's very interesting, gentlemen,

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:08.000
because when I gave you the table of results,

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:12.000
I swapped the two columns around.

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:14.000
It turns out your hospitals are killing people,

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:16.000
and they should be at home.

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:19.000
Would you like to close down the trial now,

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:22.000
or should we wait until we have robust results?"

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:25.000
Tumbleweed

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:28.000
rolls through the meeting room.

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:31.000
But Cochrane would do that kind of thing.

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:33.000
And the reason he would do that kind of thing

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:35.000
is because he understood

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:37.000
it feels so much better

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:39.000
to stand there and say,

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:41.000
"Here in my own little world,

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:43.000
I am a god, I understand everything.

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:45.000
I do not want to have my opinions challenged.

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:48.000
I do not want to have my conclusions tested."

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:50.000
It feels so much more comfortable

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:53.000
simply to lay down the law.

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:55.000
Cochrane understood

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:57.000
that uncertainty, that fallibility,

00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:59.000
that being challenged, they hurt.

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:03.000
And you sometimes need to be shocked out of that.

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:06.000
Now I'm not going to pretend that this is easy.

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:08.000
It isn't easy.

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:10.000
It's incredibly painful.

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:12.000
And since I started talking about this subject

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:14.000
and researching this subject,

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:16.000
I've been really haunted by something

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:18.000
a Japanese mathematician said on the subject.

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:20.000
So shortly after the war,

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:23.000
this young man, Yutaka Taniyama,

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:25.000
developed this amazing conjecture

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:27.000
called the Taniyama-Shimura Conjecture.

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:30.000
It turned out to be absolutely instrumental

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:32.000
many decades later

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:34.000
in proving Fermat's Last Theorem.

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:36.000
In fact, it turns out it's equivalent

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:38.000
to proving Fermat's Last Theorem.

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:42.000
You prove one, you prove the other.

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:45.000
But it was always a conjecture.

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:48.000
Taniyama tried and tried and tried

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:51.000
and he could never prove that it was true.

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:54.000
And shortly before his 30th birthday in 1958,

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:58.000
Yutaka Taniyama killed himself.

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:00.000
His friend, Goro Shimura --

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:02.000
who worked on the mathematics with him --

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:05.000
many decades later, reflected on Taniyama's life.

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:10.000
He said,

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:12.000
"He was not a very careful person

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:14.000
as a mathematician.

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:17.000
He made a lot of mistakes.

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:21.000
But he made mistakes in a good direction.

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:24.000
I tried to emulate him,

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:26.000
but I realized

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:28.000
it is very difficult

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:31.000
to make good mistakes."

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:33.000
Thank you.

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:45.000
(Applause)
