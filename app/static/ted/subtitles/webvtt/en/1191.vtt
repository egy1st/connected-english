00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Pat Mitchell: You have brought us images from the Yemen Times.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
And take us through those,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
and introduce us to another Yemen.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Nadia Al-Sakkaf: Well, I'm glad to be here.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
And I would like to share with you all

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
some of the pictures that are happening today in Yemen.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
This picture shows a revolution

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
started by women,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
and it shows women and men

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
leading a mixed protest.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
The other picture

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
is the popularity of the real need for change.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
So many people are there.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
The intensity of the upspring.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
This picture shows that the revolution

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
has allowed opportunities for training,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
for education.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
These women are learning about first aid

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
and their rights according to the constitution.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
I love this picture.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
I just wanted to show

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
that over 60 percent of the Yemeni population

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
are 15 years and below.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
And they were excluded from decision-making,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
and now they are in the forefront of the news,

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
raising the flag.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
English --

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
you will see, this is jeans

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
and tights,

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
and an English expression --

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
the ability to share with the world

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
what is going on in our own country.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
And expression also,

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
it has brought talents.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
Yemenis are using cartoons

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
and art,

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
paintings, comics,

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
to tell the world and each other

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
about what's going on.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
Obviously, there's always the dark side of it.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
And this is just one of the less-gruesome pictures

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
of the revolution

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
and the cost that we have to pay.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
The solidarity

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
of millions of Yemenis across the country

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
just demanding the one thing.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
And finally, lots of people are saying

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
that Yemen's revolution

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
is going to break the country.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
Is it going to be so many different countries?

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
Is it going to be another Somalia?

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
But we want to tell the world that, no,

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
under the one flag, we'll still remain as Yemeni people.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
PM: Thank you for those images, Nadia.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
And they do, in many ways,

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
tell a different story

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
than the story of Yemen,

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
the one that is often in the news.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
And yet, you yourself

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
defy all those characterizations.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.000
So let's talk about the personal story for a moment.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
Your father is murdered.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
The Yemen Times already has

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000
a strong reputation in Yemen

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.000
as an independent English language newspaper.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000
How did you then

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
make the decision and assume the responsibilities

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
of running a newspaper,

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000
especially in such times of conflict?

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
NA: Well, let me first warn you

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000
that I'm not the traditional Yemeni girl.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
I've guessed you've already noticed this by now.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
(Laughter)

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
In Yemen, most women are veiled

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000
and they are sitting behind doors

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000
and not very much part of the public life.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000
But there's so much potential.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000
I wish I could show you my Yemen.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
I wish you could see

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000
Yemen through my eyes.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
Then you would know

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
that there's so much to it.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000
And I was privileged because I was born into a family,

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.000
my father would always encourage the boys and the girls.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.000
He would say we are equal.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.000
And he was such an extraordinary man.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.000
And even my mother -- I owe it to my family.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000
A story:

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000
I studied in India.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000
And in my third year, I started becoming confused

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000
because I was Yemeni,

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000
but I was also mixing up

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000
with a lot of my friends in college.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000
And I went back home and I said,

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000
"Daddy, I don't know who I am.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000
I'm not a Yemeni; I'm not an Indian."

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000
And he said, "You are the bridge."

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.000
And that is something I will keep in my heart forever.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000
So since then I've been the bridge,

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000
and a lot of people have walked over me.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000
PM: I don't think so. (Laughter)

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000
NA: But it just helps tell

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000
that some people are change agents

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000
in the society.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000
And when I became editor-in-chief

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000
after my brother actually --

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000
my father passed away in 1999,

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000
and then my brother until 2005 --

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000
and everybody was betting that I will not be able to do it.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000
"What's this young girl coming in and showing off

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000
because it's her family business," or something.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
It was very hard at first.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000
I didn't want to clash with people.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000
But with all due respect

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.000
to all the men, and the older men especially,

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.000
they did not want me around.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000
It was very hard, you know,

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.000
to impose my authority.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.000
But a woman's got to do what a woman's got to do.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:57.000
(Applause)

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000
And in the first year,

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000
I had to fire half of the men.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000
(Laughter)

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:07.000
(Applause)

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.000
Brought in more women.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000
Brought in younger men.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.000
And we have a more gender-balanced newsroom today.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.000
The other thing is that it's about professionalism.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.000
It's about proving who you are and what you can do.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.000
And I don't know if I'm going to be boasting now,

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.000
but in 2006 alone,

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000
we won three international awards.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000
One of them is the IPI

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.000
Free Media Pioneer Award.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000
So that was the answer

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.000
to all the Yemeni people.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000
And I want to score a point here,

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000
because my husband is in the room over there.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:46.000
If you could please stand up, [unclear].

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.000
He has been very supportive of me.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:53.000
(Applause)

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.000
PM: And we should point out

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.000
that he works with you as well at the paper.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000
But in assuming this responsibility

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000
and going about it as you have,

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.000
you have become a bridge

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.000
between an older and traditional society

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.000
and the one that you are now creating at the paper.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.000
And so along with changing who worked there,

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.000
you must have come up against another positioning

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.000
that we always run into, in particular with women,

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.000
and it has to do with outside image,

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.000
dress, the veiled woman.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000
So how have you dealt with this

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000
on a personal level

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000
as well as the women who worked for you?

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.000
NA: As you know,

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.000
the image of a lot of Yemeni women is a lot of black

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.000
and covered, veiled women.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000
And this is true.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.000
And a lot of it is

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.000
because women are not able, are not free,

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.000
to show their face to their self.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000
It's a lot of traditional imposing

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000
coming by authority figures

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:52.000
such as the men, the grandparents and so on.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000
And it's economic empowerment

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000
and the ability for a woman to say,

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.000
"I am as much contributing to this family, or more,

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000
than you are."

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:05.000
And the more empowered the women become,

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:08.000
the more they are able to remove the veil, for example,

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.000
or to drive their own car

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.000
or to have a job or to be able to travel.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.000
So the other face of Yemen

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.000
is actually one

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.000
that lies behind the veil,

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:22.000
and it's economic empowerment mostly

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.000
that allows the woman to just uncover it.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.000
And I have done this throughout my work.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000
I've tried to encourage young girls.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:33.000
We started with, you can take it off in the office.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:36.000
And then after that, you can take it off on assignments.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.000
Because I didn't believe a journalist can be a journalist with --

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.000
how can you talk to people if you have your face covered? --

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.000
and so on; it's just a movement.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.000
And I am a role model in Yemen.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.000
A lot of people look up to me.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.000
A lot of young girls look up to me.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000
And I need to prove to them that, yes, you can still be married,

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000
you can still be a mother,

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.000
and you can still be respected within the society,

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.000
but at the same time,

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:01.000
that doesn't mean you [should] just be one of the crowd.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:04.000
You can be yourself and have your face.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:08.000
PM: But by putting yourself personally out there --

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.000
both projecting a different image

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000
of Yemeni women,

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.000
but also what you have made possible

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:17.000
for the women who work at the paper --

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:21.000
has this put you in personal danger?

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:24.000
NA: Well the Yemen Times, across 20 years,

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000
has been through so much.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000
We've suffered prosecution;

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.000
the paper was closed down more than three times.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.000
It's an independent newspaper,

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.000
but tell that to the people in charge.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:38.000
They think that if there's anything against them,

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:42.000
then we are being an opposition newspaper.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.000
And very, very difficult times.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.000
Some of my reporters were arrested.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.000
We had some court cases.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000
My father was assassinated.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:54.000
Today, we are in a much better situation.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.000
We've created the credibility.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:59.000
And in times of revolution or change like today,

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:03.000
it is very important for independent media to have a voice.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.000
It's very important

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.000
for you to go to YemenTimes.com,

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.000
and it's very important

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.000
to listen to our voice.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.000
And this is probably something

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.000
I'm going to share with you

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.000
in Western media probably --

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:22.000
and how there's a lot of stereotypes --

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:25.000
thinking of Yemen in one single frame:

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:28.000
this is what Yemen is all about.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.000
And that's not fair.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.000
It's not fair for me; it's not fair for my country.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.000
A lot of reporters come to Yemen

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:37.000
and they want to write a story on Al-Qaeda or terrorism.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:41.000
And I just wanted to share with you:

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.000
there's one reporter that came.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.000
He wanted to do a documentary

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:49.000
on what his editors wanted.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:52.000
And he ended up writing about a story that even surprised me --

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.000
hip hop --

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:57.000
that there are young Yemeni men

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.000
who express themselves

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:02.000
through dancing and puchu puchu.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.000
(Laughter)

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:07.000
That thing. (PM: Rap. Break dancing.)

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.000
Yeah, break dancing.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:12.000
I'm not so old.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.000
I'm just not in touch.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.000
(Laughter)

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:19.000
(Applause)

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.000
PM: Yes, you are.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.000
Actually, that's a documentary

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:26.000
that's available online; the video's online.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.000
NA: ShaketheDust.org.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:31.000
PM: "Shake the Dust." (NA: "Shake the Dust.")

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:33.000
PM: ShaketheDust.org.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:36.000
And it definitely does give a different image of Yemen.

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:39.000
You spoke about the responsibility of the press.

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:42.000
And certainly, when we look

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:45.000
at the ways in which we have separated ourselves from others

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.000
and we've created fear

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.000
and danger,

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.000
often from lack of knowledge,

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:53.000
lack of real understanding,

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.000
how do you see

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:58.000
the way that the Western press in particular

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:01.000
is covering this and all other stories out of the region,

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:03.000
but in particular, in your country?

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:06.000
NA: Well there is a saying that says,

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.000
"You fear what you don't know,

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:11.000
and you hate what you fear."

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:14.000
So it's about the lack of research, basically.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:17.000
It's almost, "Do your homework," --

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.000
some involvement.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:22.000
And you cannot do parachute reporting --

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:25.000
just jump into a country for two days

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:28.000
and think that you've done your homework and a story.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.000
So I wish

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.000
that the world would know my Yemen,

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:35.000
my country, my people.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:38.000
I am an example, and there are others like me.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.000
We may not be that many,

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:42.000
but if we are promoted

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:45.000
as a good, positive example,

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:48.000
there will be others -- men and women --

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:51.000
who can eventually bridge the gap --

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.000
again, coming to the bridge --

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.000
between Yemen and the world

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:57.000
and telling first

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.000
about recognition

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.000
and then about communication

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:04.000
and compassion.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.000
I think Yemen is going to be

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:09.000
in a very bad situation

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:11.000
in the next two or three years.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.000
It's natural.

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:16.000
But after the two years, which is a price we are willing to pay,

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:19.000
we are going to stand up again on our feet,

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:21.000
but in the new Yemen

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:24.000
with a younger and more empowered people --

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:26.000
democratic.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:34.000
(Applause)

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.000
PM: Nadia, I think you've just given us

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:39.000
a very different view of Yemen.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:42.000
And certainly you yourself and what you do

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:45.000
have given us a view of the future

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:48.000
that we will embrace

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.000
and be grateful for.

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:52.000
And the very best of luck to you.

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:55.000
YemenTimes.com.

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:58.000
NA: On Twitter also.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.000
PM: So you are plugged in.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:17.000
(Applause)
