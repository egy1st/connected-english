00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
I love the Internet.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
It's true.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Think about everything it has brought us.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Think about all the services we use,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
all the connectivity,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
all the entertainment,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
all the business, all the commerce.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
And it's happening during our lifetimes.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
I'm pretty sure that one day

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
we'll be writing history books

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
hundreds of years from now. This time

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
our generation will be remembered

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
as the generation that got online,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
the generation

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
that built something really and truly global.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
But yes, it's also true

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
that the Internet has problems, very serious problems,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
problems with security

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
and problems with privacy.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
I've spent my career

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
fighting these problems.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
So let me show you something.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
This here

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
is Brain.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
This is a floppy disk

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
-- five and a quarter-inch floppy disk

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
infected by Brain.A.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
It's the first virus we ever found

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
for PC computers.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
And we actually know

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
where Brain came from.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
We know because it says so

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
inside the code.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
Let's take a look.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
All right.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
That's the boot sector of an infected floppy,

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
and if we take a closer look inside,

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
we'll see that right there,

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.000
it says, "Welcome to the dungeon."

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
And then it continues,

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
saying, 1986, Basit and Amjad.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
And Basit and Amjad are first names,

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
Pakistani first names.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
In fact, there's a phone number and an address in Pakistan.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:03.000
(Laughter)

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
Now, 1986.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
Now it's 2011.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
That's 25 years ago.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.000
The PC virus problem is 25 years old now.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
So half a year ago,

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000
I decided to go to Pakistan myself.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000
So let's see, here's a couple of photos I took while I was in Pakistan.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
This is from the city of Lahore,

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
which is around 300 kilometers south

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
from Abbottabad, where Bin Laden was caught.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
Here's a typical street view.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000
And here's the street or road leading to this building,

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.000
which is 730 Nizam block at Allama Iqbal Town.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
And I knocked on the door.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
(Laughter)

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
You want to guess who opened the door?

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
Basit and Amjad; they are still there.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
(Laughter)

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.000
(Applause)

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000
So here standing up is Basit.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000
Sitting down is his brother Amjad.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000
These are the guys who wrote the first PC virus.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000
Now of course, we had a very interesting discussion.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000
I asked them why.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000
I asked them how they feel about what they started.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000
And I got some sort of satisfaction

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000
from learning that both Basit and Amjad

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000
had had their computers infected dozens of times

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
by completely unrelated other viruses

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000
over these years.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000
So there is some sort of justice

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.000
in the world after all.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
Now, the viruses that we used to see

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000
in the 1980s and 1990s

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000
obviously are not a problem any more.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000
So let me just show you a couple of examples

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000
of what they used to look like.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000
What I'm running here

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000
is a system that enables me

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000
to run age-old programs on a modern computer.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.000
So let me just mount some drives. Go over there.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.000
What we have here is a list of old viruses.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.000
So let me just run some viruses on my computer.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000
For example,

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000
let's go with the Centipede virus first.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
And you can see at the top of the screen,

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000
there's a centipede scrolling across your computer

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000
when you get infected by this one.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000
You know that you're infected

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000
because it actually shows up.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.000
Here's another one. This is the virus called Crash,

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000
invented in Russia in 1992.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000
Let me show you one which actually makes some sound.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:25.000
(Siren noise)

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000
And the last example,

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000
guess what the Walker virus does?

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000
Yes, there's a guy walking across your screen

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000
once you get infected.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000
So it used to be fairly easy to know

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.000
that you're infected by a virus,

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000
when the viruses were written by hobbyists

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000
and teenagers.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000
Today, they are no longer being written

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000
by hobbyists and teenagers.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.000
Today, viruses are a global problem.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
What we have here in the background

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.000
is an example of our systems that we run in our labs,

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000
where we track virus infections worldwide.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000
So we can actually see in real time

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.000
that we've just blocked viruses in Sweden and Taiwan

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000
and Russia and elsewhere.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.000
In fact, if I just connect back to our lab systems

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000
through the Web,

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000
we can see in real time

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.000
just some kind of idea of how many viruses,

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.000
how many new examples of malware we find every single day.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000
Here's the latest virus we've found,

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000
in a file called Server.exe.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.000
And we found it right over here three seconds ago --

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000
the previous one, six seconds ago.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.000
And if we just scroll around,

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000
it's just massive.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.000
We find tens of thousands, even hundreds of thousands.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.000
And that's the last 20 minutes of malware

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000
every single day.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.000
So where are all these coming from then?

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:46.000
Well today, it's the organized criminal gangs

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.000
writing these viruses

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000
because they make money with their viruses.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000
It's gangs like --

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.000
let's go to GangstaBucks.com.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.000
This is a website operating in Moscow

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:02.000
where these guys are buying infected computers.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.000
So if you are a virus writer

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.000
and you're capable of infecting Windows computers,

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000
but you don't know what to do with them,

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000
you can sell those infected computers --

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000
somebody else's computers -- to these guys.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:16.000
And they'll actually pay you money for those computers.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.000
So how do these guys then monetize

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.000
those infected computers?

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.000
Well there's multiple different ways,

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.000
such as banking trojans, which will steal money from your online banking accounts

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.000
when you do online banking,

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.000
or keyloggers.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:36.000
Keyloggers silently sit on your computer, hidden from view,

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.000
and they record everything you type.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.000
So you're sitting on your computer and you're doing Google searches.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000
Every single Google search you type

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.000
is saved and sent to the criminals.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.000
Every single email you write is saved and sent to the criminals.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:54.000
Same thing with every single password and so on.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000
But the thing that they're actually looking for most

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.000
are sessions where you go online

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:01.000
and do online purchases in any online store.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.000
Because when you do purchases in online stores,

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.000
you will be typing in your name, the delivery address,

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.000
your credit card number and the credit card security codes.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000
And here's an example of a file

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.000
we found from a server a couple of weeks ago.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000
That's the credit card number,

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.000
that's the expiration date, that's the security code,

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.000
and that's the name of the owner of the card.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:22.000
Once you gain access to other people's credit card information,

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.000
you can just go online and buy whatever you want

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.000
with this information.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000
And that, obviously, is a problem.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:33.000
We now have a whole underground marketplace

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:36.000
and business ecosystem

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.000
built around online crime.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.000
One example of how these guys

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:44.000
actually are capable of monetizing their operations:

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:47.000
we go and have a look at the pages of INTERPOL

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.000
and search for wanted persons.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:52.000
We find guys like Bjorn Sundin, originally from Sweden,

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000
and his partner in crime,

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.000
also listed on the INTERPOL wanted pages,

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.000
Mr. Shaileshkumar Jain,

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000
a U.S. citizen.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.000
These guys were running an operation called I.M.U.,

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.000
a cybercrime operation through which they netted millions.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:09.000
They are both right now on the run.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.000
Nobody knows where they are.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.000
U.S. officials, just a couple of weeks ago,

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.000
froze a Swiss bank account

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.000
belonging to Mr. Jain,

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:21.000
and that bank account had 14.9 million U.S. dollars on it.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:24.000
So the amount of money online crime generates

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000
is significant.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000
And that means that the online criminals

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.000
can actually afford to invest into their attacks.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.000
We know that online criminals

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.000
are hiring programmers, hiring testing people,

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.000
testing their code,

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:41.000
having back-end systems with SQL databases.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:44.000
And they can afford to watch how we work --

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000
like how security people work --

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.000
and try to work their way around

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000
any security precautions we can build.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:53.000
They also use the global nature of Internet

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.000
to their advantage.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.000
I mean, the Internet is international.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.000
That's why we call it the Internet.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.000
And if you just go and take a look

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:04.000
at what's happening in the online world,

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.000
here's a video built by Clarified Networks,

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:10.000
which illustrates how one single malware family is able to move around the world.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:13.000
This operation, believed to be originally from Estonia,

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.000
moves around from one country to another

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.000
as soon as the website is tried to shut down.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:20.000
So you just can't shut these guys down.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.000
They will switch from one country to another,

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.000
from one jurisdiction to another --

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.000
moving around the world,

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.000
using the fact that we don't have the capability

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:31.000
to globally police operations like this.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.000
So the Internet is as if

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.000
someone would have given free plane tickets

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:38.000
to all the online criminals of the world.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:41.000
Now, criminals who weren't capable of reaching us before

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.000
can reach us.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:46.000
So how do you actually go around finding online criminals?

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.000
How do you actually track them down?

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.000
Let me give you an example.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:53.000
What we have here is one exploit file.

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:57.000
Here, I'm looking at the Hex dump of an image file,

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.000
which contains an exploit.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:02.000
And that basically means, if you're trying to view this image file on your Windows computer,

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:05.000
it actually takes over your computer and runs code.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:08.000
Now, if you'll take a look at this image file --

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.000
well there's the image header,

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:13.000
and there the actual code of the attack starts.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.000
And that code has been encrypted,

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:17.000
so let's decrypt it.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.000
It has been encrypted with XOR function 97.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.000
You just have to believe me,

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.000
it is, it is.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.000
And we can go here

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.000
and actually start decrypting it.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.000
Well the yellow part of the code is now decrypted.

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:32.000
And I know, it doesn't really look much different from the original.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.000
But just keep staring at it.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.000
You'll actually see that down here

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.000
you can see a Web address:

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:44.000
unionseek.com/d/ioo.exe

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.000
And when you view this image on your computer

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.000
it actually is going to download and run that program.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:51.000
And that's a backdoor which will take over your computer.

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:53.000
But even more interestingly,

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.000
if we continue decrypting,

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.000
we'll find this mysterious string,

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:02.000
which says O600KO78RUS.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:04.000
That code is there underneath the encryption

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:06.000
as some sort of a signature.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.000
It's not used for anything.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:11.000
And I was looking at that, trying to figure out what it means.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.000
So obviously I Googled for it.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.000
I got zero hits; wasn't there.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.000
So I spoke with the guys at the lab.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.000
And we have a couple of Russian guys in our labs,

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.000
and one of them mentioned,

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.000
well, it ends in RUS like Russia.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.000
And 78 is the city code

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.000
for the city of St. Petersburg.

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.000
For example, you can find it from some phone numbers

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:32.000
and car license plates and stuff like that.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:35.000
So I went looking for contacts in St. Petersburg,

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:37.000
and through a long road,

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:41.000
we eventually found this one particular website.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:44.000
Here's this Russian guy who's been operating online for a number of years

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:46.000
who runs his own website,

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:49.000
and he runs a blog under the popular Live Journal.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.000
And on this blog, he blogs about his life,

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.000
about his life in St. Petersburg --

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.000
he's in his early 20s --

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:57.000
about his cat,

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.000
about his girlfriend.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.000
And he drives a very nice car.

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:04.000
In fact, this guy drives

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.000
a Mercedes-Benz S600

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.000
V12

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.000
with a six-liter engine

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.000
with more than 400 horsepower.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:16.000
Now that's a nice car for a 20-something year-old kid in St. Petersburg.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.000
How do I know about this car?

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.000
Because he blogged about the car.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.000
He actually had a car accident.

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:24.000
In downtown St. Petersburg,

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:26.000
he actually crashed his car into another car.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.000
And he put blogged images about the car accident --

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.000
that's his Mercedes --

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:34.000
right here is the Lada Samara he crashed into.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:37.000
And you can actually see that the license plate of the Samara

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.000
ends in 78RUS.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:42.000
And if you actually take a look at the scene picture,

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:44.000
you can see that the plate of the Mercedes

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:50.000
is O600KO78RUS.

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:52.000
Now I'm not a lawyer,

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.000
but if I would be,

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:57.000
this is where I would say, "I rest my case."

00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:59.000
(Laughter)

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:02.000
So what happens when online criminals are caught?

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:05.000
Well in most cases it never gets this far.

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:07.000
The vast majority of the online crime cases,

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:10.000
we don't even know which continent the attacks are coming from.

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:13.000
And even if we are able to find online criminals,

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:15.000
quite often there is no outcome.

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:18.000
The local police don't act, or if they do, there's not enough evidence,

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:20.000
or for some reason we can't take them down.

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.000
I wish it would be easier;

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.000
unfortunately it isn't.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:27.000
But things are also changing

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:30.000
at a very rapid pace.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:33.000
You've all heard about things like Stuxnet.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:36.000
So if you look at what Stuxnet did

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.000
is that it infected these.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:41.000
That's a Siemens S7-400 PLC,

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:43.000
programmable logic [controller].

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:46.000
And this is what runs our infrastructure.

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:49.000
This is what runs everything around us.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:52.000
PLC's, these small boxes which have no display,

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:54.000
no keyboard,

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.000
which are programmed, are put in place, and they do their job.

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:58.000
For example, the elevators in this building

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:02.000
most likely are controlled by one of these.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:05.000
And when Stuxnet infects one of these,

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:07.000
that's a massive revolution

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:10.000
on the kinds of risks we have to worry about.

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:13.000
Because everything around us is being run by these.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:15.000
I mean, we have critical infrastructure.

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:18.000
You go to any factory, any power plant,

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:20.000
any chemical plant, any food processing plant,

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:22.000
you look around --

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:24.000
everything is being run by computers.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.000
Everything is being run by computers.

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:29.000
Everything is reliant on these computers working.

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:32.000
We have become very reliant

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.000
on Internet,

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:37.000
on basic things like electricity, obviously,

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.000
on computers working.

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:41.000
And this really is something

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:43.000
which creates completely new problems for us.

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:45.000
We must have some way

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:47.000
of continuing to work

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:50.000
even if computers fail.

00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:59.000
(Laughter)

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:09.000
(Applause)

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:12.000
So preparedness means that we can do stuff

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:14.000
even when the things we take for granted

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:16.000
aren't there.

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:18.000
It's actually very basic stuff --

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:21.000
thinking about continuity, thinking about backups,

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:24.000
thinking about the things that actually matter.

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:27.000
Now I told you --

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:29.000
(Laughter)

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:33.000
I love the Internet. I do.

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:36.000
Think about all the services we have online.

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:39.000
Think about if they are taken away from you,

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:41.000
if one day you don't actually have them

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:43.000
for some reason or another.

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:46.000
I see beauty in the future of the Internet,

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:48.000
but I'm worried

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:50.000
that we might not see that.

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:52.000
I'm worried that we are running into problems

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:54.000
because of online crime.

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:56.000
Online crime is the one thing

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:58.000
that might take these things away from us.

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:01.000
(Laughter)

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:03.000
I've spent my life

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:06.000
defending the Net,

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:09.000
and I do feel that if we don't fight online crime,

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:13.000
we are running a risk of losing it all.

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:16.000
We have to do this globally,

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:19.000
and we have to do it right now.

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:21.000
What we need

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:24.000
is more global, international law enforcement work

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:26.000
to find online criminal gangs --

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:28.000
these organized gangs

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:30.000
that are making millions out of their attacks.

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:32.000
That's much more important

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:34.000
than running anti-viruses or running firewalls.

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:36.000
What actually matters

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:38.000
is actually finding the people behind these attacks,

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:40.000
and even more importantly,

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:42.000
we have to find the people

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:44.000
who are about to become

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:46.000
part of this online world of crime,

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:48.000
but haven't yet done it.

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:51.000
We have to find the people with the skills,

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:53.000
but without the opportunities

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:55.000
and give them the opportunities

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:58.000
to use their skills for good.

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:00.000
Thank you very much.

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:13.000
(Applause)
