00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Embracing otherness.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
When I first heard this theme,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
I thought, well, embracing otherness

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
is embracing myself.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
And the journey to that place

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
of understanding and acceptance

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
has been an interesting one for me,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
and it's given me an insight

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
into the whole notion of self,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
which I think is worth sharing with you today.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
We each have a self,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
but I don't think that we're born with one.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
You know how newborn babies

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
believe they're part of everything;

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
they're not separate?

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Well that fundamental sense of oneness

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
is lost on us very quickly.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
It's like that initial stage is over --

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
oneness: infancy,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
unformed, primitive.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
It's no longer valid or real.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
What is real is separateness,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
and at some point in early babyhood,

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
the idea of self

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
starts to form.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
Our little portion of oneness is given a name,

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
is told all kinds of things about itself,

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
and these details,

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
opinions and ideas

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
become facts,

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
which go towards building ourselves,

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
our identity.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
And that self becomes the vehicle

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
for navigating our social world.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
But the self is a projection

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
based on other people's projections.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
Is it who we really are?

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
Or who we really want to be, or should be?

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
So this whole interaction

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
with self and identity

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
was a very difficult one for me growing up.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
The self that I attempted to take out into the world

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
was rejected over and over again.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
And my panic

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
at not having a self that fit,

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
and the confusion that came

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
from my self being rejected,

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
created anxiety, shame

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
and hopelessness,

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000
which kind of defined me for a long time.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
But in retrospect,

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
the destruction of my self was so repetitive

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
that I started to see a pattern.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
The self changed,

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
got affected, broken, destroyed,

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
but another one would evolve --

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
sometimes stronger,

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
sometimes hateful,

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
sometimes not wanting to be there at all.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
The self was not constant.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
And how many times

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
would my self have to die

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
before I realized

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000
that it was never alive in the first place?

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
I grew up on the coast of England

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
in the '70s.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000
My dad is white from Cornwall,

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.000
and my mom is black from Zimbabwe.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
Even the idea of us as a family

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000
was challenging to most people.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000
But nature had its wicked way,

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
and brown babies were born.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
But from about the age of five,

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000
I was aware that I didn't fit.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000
I was the black atheist kid

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000
in the all-white Catholic school run by nuns.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000
I was an anomaly,

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.000
and my self was rooting around for definition

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000
and trying to plug in.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
Because the self likes to fit,

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000
to see itself replicated,

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000
to belong.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000
That confirms its existence

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
and its importance.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
And it is important.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
It has an extremely important function.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.000
Without it, we literally can't interface with others.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000
We can't hatch plans

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.000
and climb that stairway of popularity,

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000
of success.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000
But my skin color wasn't right.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000
My hair wasn't right.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000
My history wasn't right.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000
My self became defined

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000
by otherness,

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000
which meant that, in that social world,

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000
I didn't really exist.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
And I was "other" before being anything else --

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
even before being a girl.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000
I was a noticeable nobody.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000
Another world was opening up

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000
around this time:

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.000
performance and dancing.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.000
That nagging dread of self-hood

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.000
didn't exist when I was dancing.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.000
I'd literally lose myself.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.000
And I was a really good dancer.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.000
I would put

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000
all my emotional expression

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000
into my dancing.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.000
I could be in the movement

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000
in a way that I wasn't able to be

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.000
in my real life, in myself.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000
And at 16,

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.000
I stumbled across another opportunity,

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:46.000
and I earned my first acting role in a film.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000
I can hardly find the words

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.000
to describe the peace I felt

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000
when I was acting.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000
My dysfunctional self

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000
could actually plug in

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000
to another self, not my own,

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.000
and it felt so good.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000
It was the first time that I existed

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.000
inside a fully-functioning self --

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.000
one that I controlled,

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000
that I steered,

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.000
that I gave life to.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000
But the shooting day would end,

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000
and I'd return

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.000
to my gnarly, awkward self.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.000
By 19,

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000
I was a fully-fledged movie actor,

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000
but still searching for definition.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000
I applied to read anthropology

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.000
at university.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.000
Dr. Phyllis Lee gave me my interview,

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:41.000
and she asked me, "How would you define race?"

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000
Well, I thought I had the answer to that one,

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.000
and I said, "Skin color."

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:50.000
"So biology, genetics?" she said.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000
"Because, Thandie, that's not accurate.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.000
Because there's actually more genetic difference

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000
between a black Kenyan

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.000
and a black Ugandan

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.000
than there is between a black Kenyan

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.000
and, say, a white Norwegian.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.000
Because we all stem from Africa.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000
So in Africa,

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000
there's been more time

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000
to create genetic diversity."

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000
In other words,

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.000
race has no basis

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.000
in biological or scientific fact.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.000
On the one hand, result.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000
Right?

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.000
On the other hand, my definition of self

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.000
just lost a huge chunk of its credibility.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000
But what was credible,

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.000
what is biological and scientific fact,

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.000
is that we all stem from Africa --

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.000
in fact, from a woman called Mitochondrial Eve

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.000
who lived 160,000 years ago.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.000
And race is an illegitimate concept

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000
which our selves have created

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:53.000
based on fear and ignorance.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000
Strangely, these revelations

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.000
didn't cure my low self-esteem,

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:01.000
that feeling of otherness.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.000
My desire to disappear

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.000
was still very powerful.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.000
I had a degree from Cambridge;

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000
I had a thriving career,

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.000
but my self was a car crash,

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.000
and I wound up with bulimia

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.000
and on a therapist's couch.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.000
And of course I did.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.000
I still believed

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.000
my self was all I was.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.000
I still valued self-worth

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.000
above all other worth,

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.000
and what was there to suggest otherwise?

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000
We've created entire value systems

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.000
and a physical reality

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.000
to support the worth of self.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.000
Look at the industry for self-image

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.000
and the jobs it creates,

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.000
the revenue it turns over.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.000
We'd be right in assuming

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.000
that the self is an actual living thing.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:49.000
But it's not. It's a projection

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.000
which our clever brains create

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.000
in order to cheat ourselves

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:56.000
from the reality of death.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.000
But there is something

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.000
that can give the self

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:04.000
ultimate and infinite connection --

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.000
and that thing is oneness,

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.000
our essence.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.000
The self's struggle

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000
for authenticity and definition

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.000
will never end

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.000
unless it's connected to its creator --

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:19.000
to you and to me.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:22.000
And that can happen with awareness --

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:25.000
awareness of the reality of oneness

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:28.000
and the projection of self-hood.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.000
For a start, we can think about

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.000
all the times when we do lose ourselves.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.000
It happens when I dance,

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.000
when I'm acting.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.000
I'm earthed in my essence,

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.000
and my self is suspended.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.000
In those moments,

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000
I'm connected to everything --

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:49.000
the ground, the air,

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000
the sounds, the energy from the audience.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:55.000
All my senses are alert and alive

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:58.000
in much the same way as an infant might feel --

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:01.000
that feeling of oneness.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:04.000
And when I'm acting a role,

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.000
I inhabit another self,

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.000
and I give it life for awhile,

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:11.000
because when the self is suspended

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.000
so is divisiveness

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.000
and judgment.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.000
And I've played everything

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.000
from a vengeful ghost in the time of slavery

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:23.000
to Secretary of State in 2004.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.000
And no matter how other

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.000
these selves might be,

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:31.000
they're all related in me.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.000
And I honestly believe

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.000
the key to my success as an actor

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.000
and my progress as a person

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:40.000
has been the very lack of self

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.000
that used to make me feel

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:44.000
so anxious and insecure.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.000
I always wondered

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:50.000
why I could feel others' pain so deeply,

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.000
why I could recognize

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:55.000
the somebody in the nobody.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:59.000
It's because I didn't have a self to get in the way.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:02.000
I thought I lacked substance,

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.000
and the fact that I could feel others'

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:07.000
meant that I had nothing of myself to feel.

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:10.000
The thing that was a source of shame

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:13.000
was actually a source of enlightenment.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.000
And when I realized

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:17.000
and really understood

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:20.000
that my self is a projection and that it has a function,

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.000
a funny thing happened.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.000
I stopped giving it so much authority.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.000
I give it its due.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.000
I take it to therapy.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.000
I've become very familiar

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.000
with its dysfunctional behavior.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:35.000
But I'm not ashamed of my self.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.000
In fact, I respect my self

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.000
and its function.

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:42.000
And over time and with practice,

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.000
I've tried to live

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.000
more and more from my essence.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:49.000
And if you can do that,

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.000
incredible things happen.

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:54.000
I was in Congo in February,

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.000
dancing and celebrating

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.000
with women who've survived

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.000
the destruction of their selves

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:03.000
in literally unthinkable ways --

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:06.000
destroyed because other brutalized, psychopathic selves

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:09.000
all over that beautiful land

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:12.000
are fueling our selves' addiction

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:15.000
to iPods, Pads, and bling,

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.000
which further disconnect ourselves

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.000
from ever feeling their pain,

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.000
their suffering,

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.000
their death.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.000
Because, hey,

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.000
if we're all living in ourselves

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.000
and mistaking it for life,

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.000
then we're devaluing

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:33.000
and desensitizing life.

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.000
And in that disconnected state,

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:39.000
yeah, we can build factory farms with no windows,

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.000
destroy marine life

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:44.000
and use rape as a weapon of war.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:48.000
So here's a note to self:

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.000
The cracks have started to show

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:53.000
in our constructed world,

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.000
and oceans will continue

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:57.000
to surge through the cracks,

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:00.000
and oil and blood,

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:03.000
rivers of it.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:05.000
Crucially, we haven't been figuring out

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:07.000
how to live in oneness

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:10.000
with the Earth and every other living thing.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:13.000
We've just been insanely trying to figure out

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:16.000
how to live with each other -- billions of each other.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.000
Only we're not living with each other;

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:21.000
our crazy selves are living with each other

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:23.000
and perpetuating an epidemic

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:26.000
of disconnection.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:29.000
Let's live with each other

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:32.000
and take it a breath at a time.

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:36.000
If we can get under that heavy self,

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.000
light a torch of awareness,

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.000
and find our essence,

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:42.000
our connection to the infinite

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:45.000
and every other living thing.

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:47.000
We knew it from the day we were born.

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:49.000
Let's not be freaked out

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:52.000
by our bountiful nothingness.

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.000
It's more a reality

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.000
than the ones our selves have created.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:00.000
Imagine what kind of existence we can have

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:04.000
if we honor inevitable death of self,

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:08.000
appreciate the privilege of life

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:12.000
and marvel at what comes next.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:15.000
Simple awareness is where it begins.

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:17.000
Thank you for listening.

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:34.000
(Applause)
