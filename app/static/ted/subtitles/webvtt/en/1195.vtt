00:00:00.635 --> 00:00:04.882
It is a dream of mankind
to fly like a bird.

00:00:04.906 --> 00:00:06.976
Birds are very agile.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.334
They fly, not with rotating components,

00:00:10.358 --> 00:00:13.414
so they fly only by flapping their wings.

00:00:13.763 --> 00:00:15.976
So we looked at the birds,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:22.343
and we tried to make a model
that is powerful, ultralight,

00:00:22.367 --> 00:00:26.381
and it must have excellent
aerodynamic qualities

00:00:26.405 --> 00:00:30.513
that would fly by its own
and only by flapping its wings.

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:35.976
So what would be better than to use
the herring gull, in its freedom,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.314
circling and swooping over the sea,

00:00:38.338 --> 00:00:41.163
and to use this as a role model?

00:00:41.677 --> 00:00:43.637
So we bring a team together.

00:00:43.661 --> 00:00:48.741
There are generalists and also specialists
in the field of aerodynamics,

00:00:48.765 --> 00:00:50.976
in the field of building gliders.

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:56.702
And the task was to build
an ultralight indoor-flying model

00:00:56.726 --> 00:00:59.903
that is able to fly over your heads.

00:00:59.927 --> 00:01:02.000
So be careful later on.

00:01:02.485 --> 00:01:04.127
(Laughter)

00:01:04.817 --> 00:01:06.261
And this was one issue:

00:01:06.285 --> 00:01:07.977
to build it that lightweight

00:01:08.001 --> 00:01:12.832
that no one would be hurt if it fell down.

00:01:13.388 --> 00:01:15.340
So why do we do all this?

00:01:15.364 --> 00:01:18.287
We are a company
in the field of automation,

00:01:18.311 --> 00:01:20.976
and we'd like to do
very lightweight structures

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.739
because that's energy efficient,

00:01:23.763 --> 00:01:29.406
and we'd like to learn more
about pneumatics and air flow phenomena.

00:01:29.851 --> 00:01:34.278
So I now would like you
to put your seat belts on

00:01:34.302 --> 00:01:35.976
and put your hats on.

00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:39.615
So maybe we'll try it once --

00:01:39.639 --> 00:01:41.119
to fly a SmartBird.

00:01:41.143 --> 00:01:42.171
Thank you.

00:01:42.195 --> 00:01:49.086
(Applause)

00:01:58.628 --> 00:01:59.874
(Cheers)

00:01:59.898 --> 00:02:03.283
(Applause)

00:02:14.068 --> 00:02:15.958
(Applause ends)

00:02:36.008 --> 00:02:39.157
(Applause)

00:02:52.445 --> 00:02:56.782
So we can now look at the SmartBird.

00:02:57.824 --> 00:03:00.306
So here is one without a skin.

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:03.541
We have a wingspan of about two meters.

00:03:03.565 --> 00:03:05.976
The length is one meter and six,

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.187
and the weight is only 450 grams.

00:03:10.793 --> 00:03:13.976
And it is all out of carbon fiber.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.459
In the middle we have a motor,

00:03:16.483 --> 00:03:19.976
and we also have a gear in it,

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:25.615
and we use the gear
to transfer the circulation of the motor.

00:03:25.639 --> 00:03:28.825
So within the motor,
we have three Hall sensors,

00:03:28.849 --> 00:03:32.362
so we know exactly where the wing is.

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:37.451
And if we now beat up and down --

00:03:37.475 --> 00:03:41.412
(Mechanical sounds)

00:03:41.436 --> 00:03:45.499
We have the possibility
to fly like a bird.

00:03:45.523 --> 00:03:49.141
So if you go down, you have
the large area of propulsion,

00:03:49.165 --> 00:03:52.252
and if you go up,

00:03:52.276 --> 00:03:54.976
the wings are not that large,

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.000
and it is easier to get up.

00:03:59.869 --> 00:04:02.916
So, the next thing we did,

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:04.713
or the challenges we did,

00:04:04.737 --> 00:04:07.753
was to coordinate this movement.

00:04:07.777 --> 00:04:10.966
We have to turn it, go up and go down.

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:12.526
We have a split wing.

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:13.976
With the split wing,

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.976
we get the lift at the upper wing,

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.214
and we get the propulsion
at the lower wing.

00:04:20.238 --> 00:04:25.456
Also, we see how we measure
the aerodynamic efficiency.

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:29.710
We had knowledge
about the electromechanical efficiency

00:04:29.734 --> 00:04:33.692
and then we can calculate
the aerodynamic efficiency.

00:04:33.716 --> 00:04:39.036
So therefore, it rises up
from passive torsion to active torsion,

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:41.623
from 30 percent up to 80 percent.

00:04:42.321 --> 00:04:44.180
Next thing we have to do,

00:04:44.204 --> 00:04:48.305
we have to control and regulate
the whole structure.

00:04:48.329 --> 00:04:50.900
Only if you control and regulate it,

00:04:50.924 --> 00:04:54.217
you will get that aerodynamic efficiency.

00:04:54.241 --> 00:04:57.328
So the overall consumption of energy

00:04:57.352 --> 00:05:00.556
is about 25 watts at takeoff

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:04.112
and 16 to 18 watts in flight.

00:05:04.136 --> 00:05:05.145
Thank you.

00:05:05.169 --> 00:05:11.750
(Applause)

00:05:11.774 --> 00:05:14.322
Bruno Giussani: Markus,
we should fly it once more.

00:05:14.346 --> 00:05:15.751
Markus Fischer: Yeah, sure.

00:05:15.775 --> 00:05:16.843
(Audience) Yeah!

00:05:16.867 --> 00:05:18.468
(Laughter)

00:05:38.123 --> 00:05:41.840
(Gasps)

00:05:46.809 --> 00:05:48.603
(Cheers)

00:05:48.627 --> 00:05:51.730
(Applause)
