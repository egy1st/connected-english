00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
The question today is not:

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Why did we invade Afghanistan?

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
The question is:

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
why are we still in Afghanistan

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
one decade later?

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Why are we spending

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
$135 billion?

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Why have we got 130,000 troops on the ground?

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Why were more people killed

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
last month

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
than in any preceding month

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
of this conflict?

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
How has this happened?

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
The last 20 years

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
has been the age of intervention,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
and Afghanistan is simply one act

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
in a five-act tragedy.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
We came out of the end of the Cold War

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
in despair.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
We faced Rwanda;

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
we faced Bosnia,

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
and then we rediscovered our confidence.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
In the third act, we went into Bosnia and Kosovo

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
and we seemed to succeed.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
In the fourth act, with our hubris,

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
our overconfidence developing,

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
we invaded Iraq and Afghanistan,

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
and in the fifth act,

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.000
we plunged into a humiliating mess.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
So the question is: What are we doing?

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
Why are we still stuck in Afghanistan?

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
And the answer, of course,

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
that we keep being given

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
is as follows:

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
we're told that we went into Afghanistan

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
because of 9/11,

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
and that we remain there

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
because the Taliban poses an existential threat

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
to global security.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
In the words of President Obama,

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
"If the Taliban take over again,

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
they will invite back Al-Qaeda,

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
who will try to kill as many of our people

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
as they possibly can."

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
The story that we're told

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
is that there was a "light footprint" initially --

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
in other words, that we ended up in a situation

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
where we didn't have enough troops,

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
we didn't have enough resources,

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
that Afghans were frustrated --

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
they felt there wasn't enough progress

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
and economic development and security,

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
and therefore the Taliban came back --

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
that we responded in 2005 and 2006

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
with troop deployments,

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.000
but we still didn't put enough troops on the ground.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
And that it wasn't until 2009,

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
when President Obama signed off on a surge,

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
that we finally had,

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
in the words of Secretary Clinton,

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000
"the strategy, the leadership and the resources."

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000
So, as the president now reassures us,

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.000
we are on track to achieve our goals.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
All of this is wrong.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
Every one of those statements is wrong.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
Afghanistan does not

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
pose an existential threat

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000
to global security.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
It is extremely unlikely

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
the Taliban would ever be able to take over the country --

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
extremely unlikely they'd be able to seize Kabul.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000
They simply don't have a conventional military option.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000
And even if they were able to do so, even if I'm wrong,

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000
it's extremely unlikely

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
the Taliban would invite back Al-Qaeda.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
From the Taliban's point of view,

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000
that was their number one mistake last time.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
If they hadn't invited back Al-Qaeda,

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000
they would still be in power today.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
And even if I'm wrong about those two things,

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000
even if they were able to take back the country,

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.000
even if they were to invite back Al-Qaeda,

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
it's extremely unlikely

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
that Al-Qaeda would significantly enhance

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
its ability to harm the United States

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000
or harm Europe.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000
Because this isn't the 1990s anymore.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000
If the Al-Qaeda base

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000
was to be established near Ghazni,

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000
we would hit them very hard,

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000
and it would be very, very difficult

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000
for the Taliban to protect them.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.000
Furthermore, it's simply not true

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000
that what went wrong in Afghanistan

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000
is the light footprint.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000
In my experience, in fact,

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.000
the light footprint was extremely helpful.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000
And these troops that we brought in --

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000
it's a great picture of David Beckham

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000
there on the sub-machine gun --

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.000
made the situation worse, not better.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000
When I walked across Afghanistan

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000
in the winter of 2001-2002,

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000
what I saw was scenes like this.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000
A girl, if you're lucky,

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000
in the corner of a dark room --

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000
lucky to be able to look at the Koran.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000
But in those early days

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
when we're told we didn't have enough troops and enough resources,

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
we made a lot of progress in Afghanistan.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
Within a few months,

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.000
there were two and a half million more girls in school.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.000
In Sangin where I was sick in 2002,

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000
the nearest health clinic

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000
was within three days walk.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.000
Today, there are 14 health clinics

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000
in that area alone.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000
There was amazing improvements.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000
We went from almost no Afghans

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000
having mobile telephones during the Taliban

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000
to a situation where, almost overnight,

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:59.000
three million Afghans had mobile telephones.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000
And we had progress in the free media.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000
We had progress in elections --

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000
all of this with the so-called light footprint.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000
But when we began to bring more money,

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.000
when we began to invest more resources,

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.000
things got worse, not better. How?

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000
Well first see, if you put 125 billion dollars a year

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000
into a country like Afghanistan

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.000
where the entire revenue of the Afghan state

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000
is one billion dollars a year,

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.000
you drown everything.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000
It's not simply corruption and waste

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000
that you create;

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.000
you essentially replace the priorities of the Afghan government,

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000
the elected Afghan government,

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000
with the micromanaging tendencies

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.000
of foreigners on short tours

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.000
with their own priorities.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000
And the same is true for the troops.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.000
When I walked across Afghanistan,

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000
I stayed with people like this.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.000
This is Commandant Haji Malem Mohsin Khan of Kamenj.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.000
Commandant Haji Malem Mohsin Khan of Kamenj was a great host.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000
He was very generous,

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000
like many of the Afghans I stayed with.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000
But he was also considerably more conservative,

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000
considerably more anti-foreign,

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000
considerably more Islamist

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.000
than we'd like to acknowledge.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000
This man, for example, Mullah Mustafa,

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000
tried to shoot me.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.000
And the reason I'm looking a little bit perplexed in this photograph

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.000
is I was somewhat frightened,

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.000
and I was too afraid on this occasion

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.000
to ask him, having run for an hour through the desert

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.000
and taken refuge in this house,

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:29.000
why he had turned up and wanted to have his photograph taken with me.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000
But 18 months later, I asked him

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.000
why he had tried to shoot me.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.000
And Mullah Mustafa -- he's the man with the pen and paper --

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.000
explained that the man sitting immediately to the left as you look at the photograph,

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.000
Nadir Shah

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:43.000
had bet him that he couldn't hit me.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.000
Now this is not to say

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.000
Afghanistan is a place full of people like Mullah Mustafa.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.000
It's not; it's a wonderful place

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.000
full of incredible energy and intelligence.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000
But it is a place

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.000
where the putting-in of the troops

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:01.000
has increased the violence rather than decreased it.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.000
2005, Anthony Fitzherbert,

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.000
an agricultural engineer,

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.000
could travel through Helmand,

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000
could stay in Nad Ali, Sangin and Ghoresh,

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.000
which are now the names of villages where fighting is taking place.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.000
Today, he could never do that.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.000
So the idea that we deployed the troops

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.000
to respond to the Taliban insurgency

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.000
is mistaken.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.000
Rather than preceding the insurgency,

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:26.000
the Taliban followed the troop deployment,

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.000
and as far as I'm concerned,

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:31.000
the troop deployment caused their return.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.000
Now is this a new idea?

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.000
No, there have been any number of people

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.000
saying this over the last seven years.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.000
I ran a center at Harvard

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.000
from 2008 to 2010,

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.000
and there were people like Michael Semple there

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.000
who speak Afghan languages fluently,

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:49.000
who've traveled to almost every district in the country.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:52.000
Andrew Wilder, for example,

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:55.000
born on the Pakistan-Iranian border,

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.000
served his whole life

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.000
in Pakistan and Afghanistan.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.000
Paul Fishstein who began working there in 1978 --

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.000
worked for Save the Children,

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.000
ran the Afghan research and evaluation unit.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.000
These are people

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.000
who were able to say consistently

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.000
that the increase in development aid

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:16.000
was making Afghanistan less secure, not more secure --

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.000
that the counter-insurgency strategy

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:21.000
was not working and would not work.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:24.000
And yet, nobody listened to them.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000
Instead,

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000
there was a litany of astonishing optimism.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.000
Beginning in 2004,

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:34.000
every general came in saying,

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.000
"I've inherited a dismal situation,

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.000
but finally I have the right resources and the correct strategy,

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.000
which will deliver,"

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.000
in General Barno's word in 2004,

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.000
the "decisive year."

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.000
Well guess what? It didn't.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:50.000
But it wasn't sufficient to prevent General Abuzaid saying

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.000
that he had the strategy and the resources

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.000
to deliver, in 2005,

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.000
the "decisive year."

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:59.000
Or General David Richards to come in 2006

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.000
and say he had the strategy and the resources

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.000
to deliver the "crunch year."

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.000
Or in 2007,

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:08.000
the Norwegian deputy foreign minister, Espen Eide,

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:11.000
to say that that would deliver the "decisive year."

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.000
Or in 2008, Major General Champoux

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:16.000
to come in and say he would deliver the "decisive year."

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.000
Or in 2009, my great friend,

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.000
General Stanley McChrystal,

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:23.000
who said that he was "knee-deep in the decisive year."

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.000
Or in 2010,

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:28.000
the U.K. foreign secretary, David Miliband,

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:31.000
who said that at last we would deliver the "decisive year."

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:34.000
And you'll be delighted to hear in 2011, today,

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:37.000
that Guido Westerwelle, the German foreign minister,

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:40.000
assures us that we are in the "decisive year."

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:48.000
(Applause)

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.000
How do we allow

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.000
any of this to happen?

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.000
Well the answer, of course, is,

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.000
if you spend 125 billion or 130 billion

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:59.000
dollars a year in a country,

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.000
you co-opt almost everybody.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.000
Even the aid agencies,

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.000
who begin to receive an enormous amount of money

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.000
from the U.S. and the European governments

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.000
to build schools and clinics,

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.000
are somewhat disinclined

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.000
to challenge the idea

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.000
that Afghanistan is an existential threat

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:17.000
to global security.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.000
They're worried, in other words,

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.000
that if anybody believes that it wasn't such a threat --

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.000
Oxfam, Save the Children

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.000
wouldn't get the money

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.000
to build their hospitals and schools.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.000
It's also very difficult to confront a general

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.000
with medals on his chest.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:34.000
It's very difficult for a politician,

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:37.000
because you're afraid that many lives have been lost in vain.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.000
You feel deep, deep guilt.

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:42.000
You exaggerate your fears,

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:45.000
and you're terrified about the humiliation

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.000
of defeat.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.000
What is the solution to this?

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.000
Well the solution to this

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:53.000
is we need to find a way

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:56.000
that people like Michael Semple, or those other people,

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:59.000
who are telling the truth, who know the country,

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.000
who've spent 30 years on the ground --

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:03.000
and most importantly of all,

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:05.000
the missing component of this --

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:07.000
Afghans themselves,

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:10.000
who understand what is going on.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:13.000
We need to somehow get their message

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.000
to the policymakers.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.000
And this is very difficult to do

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.000
because of our structures.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.000
The first thing we need to change

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.000
is the structures of our government.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.000
Very, very sadly,

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.000
our foreign services, the United Nations,

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.000
the military in these countries

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.000
have very little idea of what's going on.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:34.000
The average British soldier is on a tour of only six months;

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:37.000
Italian soldiers, on tours of four months;

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:40.000
the American military, on tours of 12 months.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:43.000
Diplomats are locked in embassy compounds.

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:46.000
When they go out, they travel in these curious armored vehicles

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:49.000
with these somewhat threatening security teams

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.000
who ready 24 hours in advance

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.000
who say you can only stay on the ground for an hour.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.000
In the British embassy in Afghanistan

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:57.000
in 2008,

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.000
an embassy of 350 people,

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:02.000
there were only three people who could speak Dari,

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:05.000
the main language of Afghanistan, at a decent level.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:08.000
And there was not a single Pashto speaker.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:11.000
In the Afghan section in London

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:14.000
responsible for governing Afghan policy on the ground,

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.000
I was told last year

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.000
that there was not a single staff member

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:21.000
of the foreign office in that section

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:23.000
who had ever served

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:25.000
on a posting in Afghanistan.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.000
So we need to change that institutional culture.

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:30.000
And I could make the same points about the United States

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.000
and the United Nations.

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:35.000
Secondly, we need to aim off of the optimism of the generals.

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:38.000
We need to make sure that we're a little bit suspicious,

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.000
that we understand that optimism

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:42.000
is in the DNA of the military,

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:44.000
that we don't respond to it

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:46.000
with quite as much alacrity.

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:49.000
And thirdly, we need to have some humility.

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:51.000
We need to begin from the position

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.000
that our knowledge, our power,

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.000
our legitimacy

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.000
is limited.

00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:59.000
This doesn't mean

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.000
that intervention around the world is a disaster.

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:03.000
It isn't.

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:05.000
Bosnia and Kosovo

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:07.000
were signal successes,

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:10.000
great successes.

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.000
Today when you go to Bosnia

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.000
it is almost impossible to believe

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:18.000
that what we saw in the early 1990s happened.

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:21.000
It's almost impossible to believe the progress we've made

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:24.000
since 1994.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.000
Refugee return,

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:28.000
which the United Nations High Commission for Refugees

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.000
thought would be extremely unlikely,

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.000
has largely happened.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.000
A million properties have been returned.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:36.000
Borders between the Bosniak territory

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:39.000
and the Bosnian-Serb territory have calmed down.

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:42.000
The national army has shrunk.

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.000
The crime rates in Bosnia today

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:47.000
are lower than they are in Sweden.

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.000
This has been done

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:53.000
by an incredible, principled effort

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.000
by the international community,

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.000
and, of course, above all,

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:59.000
by Bosnians themselves.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:01.000
But you need to look at context.

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:04.000
And this is what we've lost in Afghanistan and Iraq.

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:06.000
You need to understand that in those places

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:08.000
what really mattered

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:10.000
was, firstly, the role of Tudman and Milosevic

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:12.000
in coming to the agreement,

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:15.000
and then the fact those men went,

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:17.000
that the regional situation improved,

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:20.000
that the European Union could offer Bosnia

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:22.000
something extraordinary:

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:24.000
the chance to be part

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.000
of a new thing, a new club,

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:29.000
a chance to join something bigger.

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:32.000
And finally, we need to understand that in Bosnia and Kosovo,

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.000
a lot of the secret of what we did,

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:36.000
a lot of the secret of our success,

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:38.000
was our humility --

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:41.000
was the tentative nature of our engagement.

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:43.000
We criticized people a lot in Bosnia

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:45.000
for being quite slow to take on war criminals.

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:47.000
We criticized them

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:49.000
for being quite slow to return refugees.

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:51.000
But that slowness, that caution,

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:54.000
the fact that President Clinton initially said

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:56.000
that American troops would only be deployed for a year,

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:58.000
turned out to be a strength,

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:01.000
and it helped us to put our priorities right.

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.000
One of the saddest things

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:05.000
about our involvement in Afghanistan

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:07.000
is that we've got our priorities out of sync.

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:10.000
We're not matching our resources to our priorities.

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:13.000
Because if what we're interested in is terrorism,

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:16.000
Pakistan is far more important than Afghanistan.

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:18.000
If what we're interested in is regional stability,

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.000
Egypt is far more important.

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:23.000
If what we're worried about is poverty and development,

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:26.000
sub-Saharan Africa is far more important.

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:29.000
This doesn't mean that Afghanistan doesn't matter,

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:31.000
but that it's one of 40 countries in the world

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:33.000
with which we need to engage.

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:37.000
So if I can finish with a metaphor for intervention,

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:40.000
what we need to think of

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:43.000
is something like mountain rescue.

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:45.000
Why mountain rescue?

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:48.000
Because when people talk about intervention,

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:50.000
they imagine that some scientific theory --

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:52.000
the Rand Corporation goes around

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:55.000
counting 43 previous insurgencies

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:57.000
producing mathematical formula

00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:59.000
saying you need one trained counter-insurgent

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:02.000
for every 20 members of the population.

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:04.000
This is the wrong way of looking at it.

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:07.000
You need to look at it in the way that you look at mountain rescue.

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:09.000
When you're doing mountain rescue,

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:12.000
you don't take a doctorate in mountain rescue,

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:15.000
you look for somebody who knows the terrain.

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:17.000
It's about context.

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:19.000
You understand that you can prepare,

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:21.000
but the amount of preparation you can do

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:23.000
is limited --

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:25.000
you can take some water, you can have a map,

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:27.000
you can have a pack.

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:29.000
But what really matters

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:31.000
is two kinds of problems --

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:33.000
problems that occur on the mountain

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:35.000
which you couldn't anticipate,

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:38.000
such as, for example, ice on a slope,

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:40.000
but which you can get around,

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:43.000
and problems which you couldn't anticipate

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:45.000
and which you can't get around,

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:47.000
like a sudden blizzard or an avalanche

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:49.000
or a change in the weather.

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:51.000
And the key to this

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:54.000
is a guide who has been on that mountain,

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:56.000
in every temperature,

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:58.000
at every period --

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:00.000
a guide who, above all,

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:02.000
knows when to turn back,

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:04.000
who doesn't press on relentlessly

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:06.000
when conditions turn against them.

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:08.000
What we look for

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:11.000
in firemen, in climbers, in policemen,

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:13.000
and what we should look for in intervention,

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:15.000
is intelligent risk takers --

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:18.000
not people who plunge blind off a cliff,

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:21.000
not people who jump into a burning room,

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:23.000
but who weigh their risks,

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:25.000
weigh their responsibilities.

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:28.000
Because the worst thing we have done in Afghanistan

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:30.000
is this idea

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:33.000
that failure is not an option.

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:36.000
It makes failure invisible,

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:39.000
inconceivable and inevitable.

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:41.000
And if we can resist

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:43.000
this crazy slogan,

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:45.000
we shall discover --

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:47.000
in Egypt, in Syria, in Libya,

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:50.000
and anywhere else we go in the world --

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:53.000
that if we can often do much less than we pretend,

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:57.000
we can do much more than we fear.

00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:59.000
Thank you very much.

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:01.000
(Applause)

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:04.000
Thank you. Thank you very much.

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:07.000
Thank you. Thank you very much.

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:11.000
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:19.000
(Applause)

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:21.000
Thank you.

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:23.000
Thank you. Thank you.

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:25.000
Thank you.

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:27.000
(Applause)

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:30.000
Bruno Giussani: Rory, you mentioned Libya at the end.

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:33.000
Just briefly, what's your take on the current events there

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:35.000
and the intervention?

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:38.000
Rory Stewart: Okay, I think Libya poses the classic problem.

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:40.000
The problem in Libya

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:42.000
is that we are always pushing for the black or white.

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:44.000
We imagine there are only two choices:

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:47.000
either full engagement and troop deployment

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:49.000
or total isolation.

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:52.000
And we are always being tempted up to our neck.

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:54.000
We put our toes in and we go up to our neck.

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:56.000
What we should have done in Libya

00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:58.000
is we should have stuck to the U.N. resolution.

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:01.000
We should have limited ourselves very, very strictly

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:04.000
to the protection of the civilian population in Benghazi.

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:06.000
We could have done that.

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:09.000
We set up a no-fly zone within 48 hours

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:11.000
because Gaddafi had no planes

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:13.000
within 48 hours.

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:16.000
Instead of which, we've allowed ourselves to be tempted

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:18.000
towards regime change.

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:22.000
In doing so, we've destroyed our credibility with the Security Council,

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:24.000
which means it's very difficult

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:26.000
to get a resolution on Syria,

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:29.000
and we're setting ourselves up again for failure.

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:31.000
Once more, humility,

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:33.000
limits, honesty,

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:35.000
realistic expectations

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:37.000
and we could have achieved something to be proud of.

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:39.000
BG: Rory, thank you very much.

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:41.000
RS: Thank you. (BG: Thank you.)
