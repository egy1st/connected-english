00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Cities are the crucible of civilization.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
They have been expanding,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
urbanization has been expanding,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
at an exponential rate in the last 200 years

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
so that by the second part of this century,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
the planet will be completely dominated

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
by cities.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Cities are the origins of global warming,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
impact on the environment,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
health, pollution, disease,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
finance,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
economies, energy --

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
they're all problems

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
that are confronted by having cities.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
That's where all these problems come from.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
And the tsunami of problems that we feel we're facing

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
in terms of sustainability questions

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
are actually a reflection

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
of the exponential increase

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
in urbanization across the planet.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
Here's some numbers.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
Two hundred years ago, the United States

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
was less than a few percent urbanized.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
It's now more than 82 percent.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
The planet has crossed the halfway mark a few years ago.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
China's building 300 new cities

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
in the next 20 years.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
Now listen to this:

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
Every week for the foreseeable future,

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
until 2050,

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
every week more than a million people

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
are being added to our cities.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
This is going to affect everything.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
Everybody in this room, if you stay alive,

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
is going to be affected

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
by what's happening in cities

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
in this extraordinary phenomenon.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
However, cities,

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
despite having this negative aspect to them,

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
are also the solution.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.000
Because cities are the vacuum cleaners and the magnets

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
that have sucked up creative people,

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
creating ideas, innovation,

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
wealth and so on.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
So we have this kind of dual nature.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
And so there's an urgent need

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000
for a scientific theory of cities.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
Now these are my comrades in arms.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
This work has been done with an extraordinary group of people,

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
and they've done all the work,

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
and I'm the great bullshitter

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
that tries to bring it all together.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
(Laughter)

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
So here's the problem: This is what we all want.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
The 10 billion people on the planet in 2050

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
want to live in places like this,

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
having things like this,

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
doing things like this,

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000
with economies that are growing like this,

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
not realizing that entropy

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
produces things like this,

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.000
this, this

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
and this.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
And the question is:

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
Is that what Edinburgh and London and New York

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
are going to look like in 2050,

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
or is it going to be this?

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
That's the question.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
I must say, many of the indicators

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000
look like this is what it's going to look like,

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000
but let's talk about it.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000
So my provocative statement

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000
is that we desperately need a serious scientific theory of cities.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000
And scientific theory means quantifiable --

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000
relying on underlying generic principles

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
that can be made into a predictive framework.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000
That's the quest.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000
Is that conceivable?

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000
Are there universal laws?

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
So here's two questions

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
that I have in my head when I think about this problem.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000
The first is:

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
Are cities part of biology?

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
Is London a great big whale?

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
Is Edinburgh a horse?

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
Is Microsoft a great big anthill?

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000
What do we learn from that?

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000
We use them metaphorically --

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
the DNA of a company, the metabolism of a city, and so on --

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
is that just bullshit, metaphorical bullshit,

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000
or is there serious substance to it?

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000
And if that is the case,

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000
how come that it's very hard to kill a city?

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000
You could drop an atom bomb on a city,

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000
and 30 years later it's surviving.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.000
Very few cities fail.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000
All companies die, all companies.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000
And if you have a serious theory, you should be able to predict

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.000
when Google is going to go bust.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.000
So is that just another version

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000
of this?

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
Well we understand this very well.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
That is, you ask any generic question about this --

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000
how many trees of a given size,

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000
how many branches of a given size does a tree have,

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000
how many leaves,

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000
what is the energy flowing through each branch,

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000
what is the size of the canopy,

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000
what is its growth, what is its mortality?

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000
We have a mathematical framework

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000
based on generic universal principles

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000
that can answer those questions.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.000
And the idea is can we do the same for this?

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.000
So the route in is recognizing

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
one of the most extraordinary things about life,

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
is that it is scalable,

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000
it works over an extraordinary range.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000
This is just a tiny range actually:

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000
It's us mammals;

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000
we're one of these.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000
The same principles, the same dynamics,

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000
the same organization is at work

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000
in all of these, including us,

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.000
and it can scale over a range of 100 million in size.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.000
And that is one of the main reasons

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000
life is so resilient and robust --

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000
scalability.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.000
We're going to discuss that in a moment more.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000
But you know, at a local level,

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000
you scale; everybody in this room is scaled.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000
That's called growth.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000
Here's how you grew.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000
Rat, that's a rat -- could have been you.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.000
We're all pretty much the same.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000
And you see, you're very familiar with this.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000
You grow very quickly and then you stop.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000
And that line there

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000
is a prediction from the same theory,

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000
based on the same principles,

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000
that describes that forest.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000
And here it is for the growth of a rat,

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000
and those points on there are data points.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000
This is just the weight versus the age.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000
And you see, it stops growing.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.000
Very, very good for biology --

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000
also one of the reasons for its great resilience.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.000
Very, very bad

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000
for economies and companies and cities

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000
in our present paradigm.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.000
This is what we believe.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000
This is what our whole economy

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.000
is thrusting upon us,

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.000
particularly illustrated in that left-hand corner:

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000
hockey sticks.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.000
This is a bunch of software companies --

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000
and what it is is their revenue versus their age --

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.000
all zooming away,

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000
and everybody making millions and billions of dollars.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.000
Okay, so how do we understand this?

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.000
So let's first talk about biology.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.000
This is explicitly showing you

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.000
how things scale,

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.000
and this is a truly remarkable graph.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.000
What is plotted here is metabolic rate --

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.000
how much energy you need per day to stay alive --

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.000
versus your weight, your mass,

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.000
for all of us bunch of organisms.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.000
And it's plotted in this funny way by going up by factors of 10,

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000
otherwise you couldn't get everything on the graph.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000
And what you see if you plot it

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.000
in this slightly curious way

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.000
is that everybody lies on the same line.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.000
Despite the fact that this is the most complex and diverse system

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.000
in the universe,

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000
there's an extraordinary simplicity

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.000
being expressed by this.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:49.000
It's particularly astonishing

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000
because each one of these organisms,

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000
each subsystem, each cell type, each gene,

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:57.000
has evolved in its own unique environmental niche

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.000
with its own unique history.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.000
And yet, despite all of that Darwinian evolution

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.000
and natural selection,

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.000
they've been constrained to lie on a line.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000
Something else is going on.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000
Before I talk about that,

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.000
I've written down at the bottom there

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000
the slope of this curve, this straight line.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.000
It's three-quarters, roughly,

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.000
which is less than one -- and we call that sublinear.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.000
And here's the point of that.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:25.000
It says that, if it were linear,

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.000
the steepest slope,

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000
then doubling the size

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000
you would require double the amount of energy.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:34.000
But it's sublinear, and what that translates into

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000
is that, if you double the size of the organism,

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.000
you actually only need 75 percent more energy.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.000
So a wonderful thing about all of biology

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:44.000
is that it expresses an extraordinary economy of scale.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.000
The bigger you are systematically,

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.000
according to very well-defined rules,

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:51.000
less energy per capita.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:54.000
Now any physiological variable you can think of,

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.000
any life history event you can think of,

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:59.000
if you plot it this way, looks like this.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.000
There is an extraordinary regularity.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.000
So you tell me the size of a mammal,

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.000
I can tell you at the 90 percent level everything about it

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:10.000
in terms of its physiology, life history, etc.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:13.000
And the reason for this is because of networks.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:16.000
All of life is controlled by networks --

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.000
from the intracellular through the multicellular

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.000
through the ecosystem level.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:23.000
And you're very familiar with these networks.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.000
That's a little thing that lives inside an elephant.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:30.000
And here's the summary of what I'm saying.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000
If you take those networks,

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.000
this idea of networks,

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.000
and you apply universal principles,

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.000
mathematizable, universal principles,

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.000
all of these scalings

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:43.000
and all of these constraints follow,

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.000
including the description of the forest,

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.000
the description of your circulatory system,

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.000
the description within cells.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:52.000
One of the things I did not stress in that introduction

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:55.000
was that, systematically, the pace of life

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.000
decreases as you get bigger.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:00.000
Heart rates are slower; you live longer;

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000
diffusion of oxygen and resources

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000
across membranes is slower, etc.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.000
The question is: Is any of this true

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:09.000
for cities and companies?

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.000
So is London a scaled up Birmingham,

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.000
which is a scaled up Brighton, etc., etc.?

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.000
Is New York a scaled up San Francisco,

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.000
which is a scaled up Santa Fe?

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.000
Don't know. We will discuss that.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.000
But they are networks,

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.000
and the most important network of cities

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.000
is you.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:30.000
Cities are just a physical manifestation

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.000
of your interactions,

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.000
our interactions,

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.000
and the clustering and grouping of individuals.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.000
Here's just a symbolic picture of that.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.000
And here's scaling of cities.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:44.000
This shows that in this very simple example,

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.000
which happens to be a mundane example

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.000
of number of petrol stations

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.000
as a function of size --

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.000
plotted in the same way as the biology --

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.000
you see exactly the same kind of thing.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.000
There is a scaling.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:00.000
That is that the number of petrol stations in the city

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.000
is now given to you

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.000
when you tell me its size.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:07.000
The slope of that is less than linear.

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.000
There is an economy of scale.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:12.000
Less petrol stations per capita the bigger you are -- not surprising.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.000
But here's what's surprising.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.000
It scales in the same way everywhere.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.000
This is just European countries,

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:21.000
but you do it in Japan or China or Colombia,

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.000
always the same

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.000
with the same kind of economy of scale

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.000
to the same degree.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:30.000
And any infrastructure you look at --

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:33.000
whether it's the length of roads, length of electrical lines --

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.000
anything you look at

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:38.000
has the same economy of scale scaling in the same way.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.000
It's an integrated system

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:43.000
that has evolved despite all the planning and so on.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.000
But even more surprising

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.000
is if you look at socio-economic quantities,

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:50.000
quantities that have no analog in biology,

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:53.000
that have evolved when we started forming communities

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.000
eight to 10,000 years ago.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.000
The top one is wages as a function of size

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.000
plotted in the same way.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.000
And the bottom one is you lot --

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:04.000
super-creatives plotted in the same way.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:06.000
And what you see

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.000
is a scaling phenomenon.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.000
But most important in this,

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.000
the exponent, the analog to that three-quarters

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.000
for the metabolic rate,

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.000
is bigger than one -- it's about 1.15 to 1.2.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.000
Here it is,

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:21.000
which says that the bigger you are

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:24.000
the more you have per capita, unlike biology --

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:28.000
higher wages, more super-creative people per capita as you get bigger,

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:31.000
more patents per capita, more crime per capita.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:33.000
And we've looked at everything:

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:36.000
more AIDS cases, flu, etc.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.000
And here, they're all plotted together.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.000
Just to show you what we plotted,

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:43.000
here is income, GDP --

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.000
GDP of the city --

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:47.000
crime and patents all on one graph.

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.000
And you can see, they all follow the same line.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.000
And here's the statement.

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:54.000
If you double the size of a city from 100,000 to 200,000,

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.000
from a million to two million, 10 to 20 million,

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.000
it doesn't matter,

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.000
then systematically

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.000
you get a 15 percent increase

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.000
in wages, wealth, number of AIDS cases,

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.000
number of police,

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.000
anything you can think of.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.000
It goes up by 15 percent,

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:13.000
and you have a 15 percent savings

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:16.000
on the infrastructure.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:19.000
This, no doubt, is the reason

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:22.000
why a million people a week are gathering in cities.

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:25.000
Because they think that all those wonderful things --

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.000
like creative people, wealth, income --

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:29.000
is what attracts them,

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:31.000
forgetting about the ugly and the bad.

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:33.000
What is the reason for this?

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:36.000
Well I don't have time to tell you about all the mathematics,

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:39.000
but underlying this is the social networks,

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:42.000
because this is a universal phenomenon.

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:45.000
This 15 percent rule

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:47.000
is true

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:49.000
no matter where you are on the planet --

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:51.000
Japan, Chile,

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:54.000
Portugal, Scotland, doesn't matter.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:57.000
Always, all the data shows it's the same,

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:00.000
despite the fact that these cities have evolved independently.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.000
Something universal is going on.

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:05.000
The universality, to repeat, is us --

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:07.000
that we are the city.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:10.000
And it is our interactions and the clustering of those interactions.

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.000
So there it is, I've said it again.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:15.000
So if it is those networks and their mathematical structure,

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:18.000
unlike biology, which had sublinear scaling,

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:20.000
economies of scale,

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.000
you had the slowing of the pace of life

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.000
as you get bigger.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.000
If it's social networks with super-linear scaling --

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:28.000
more per capita --

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.000
then the theory says

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.000
that you increase the pace of life.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.000
The bigger you are, life gets faster.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:36.000
On the left is the heart rate showing biology.

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.000
On the right is the speed of walking

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.000
in a bunch of European cities,

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:42.000
showing that increase.

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:45.000
Lastly, I want to talk about growth.

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:48.000
This is what we had in biology, just to repeat.

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:51.000
Economies of scale

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:54.000
gave rise to this sigmoidal behavior.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:57.000
You grow fast and then stop --

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:59.000
part of our resilience.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:02.000
That would be bad for economies and cities.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.000
And indeed, one of the wonderful things about the theory

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:07.000
is that if you have super-linear scaling

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:09.000
from wealth creation and innovation,

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:12.000
then indeed you get, from the same theory,

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:14.000
a beautiful rising exponential curve -- lovely.

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.000
And in fact, if you compare it to data,

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.000
it fits very well

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:20.000
with the development of cities and economies.

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:22.000
But it has a terrible catch,

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:24.000
and the catch

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:27.000
is that this system is destined to collapse.

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:29.000
And it's destined to collapse for many reasons --

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:32.000
kind of Malthusian reasons -- that you run out of resources.

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:35.000
And how do you avoid that? Well we've done it before.

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:37.000
What we do is,

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:40.000
as we grow and we approach the collapse,

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:43.000
a major innovation takes place

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:45.000
and we start over again,

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:48.000
and we start over again as we approach the next one, and so on.

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:50.000
So there's this continuous cycle of innovation

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:52.000
that is necessary

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:55.000
in order to sustain growth and avoid collapse.

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:57.000
The catch, however, to this

00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:59.000
is that you have to innovate

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:02.000
faster and faster and faster.

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:04.000
So the image

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:07.000
is that we're not only on a treadmill that's going faster,

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:10.000
but we have to change the treadmill faster and faster.

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:13.000
We have to accelerate on a continuous basis.

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:16.000
And the question is: Can we, as socio-economic beings,

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:19.000
avoid a heart attack?

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:22.000
So lastly, I'm going to finish up in this last minute or two

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:24.000
asking about companies.

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:26.000
See companies, they scale.

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:28.000
The top one, in fact, is Walmart on the right.

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:30.000
It's the same plot.

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:32.000
This happens to be income and assets

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:34.000
versus the size of the company as denoted by its number of employees.

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:37.000
We could use sales, anything you like.

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:40.000
There it is: after some little fluctuations at the beginning,

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:42.000
when companies are innovating,

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:44.000
they scale beautifully.

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:47.000
And we've looked at 23,000 companies

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:49.000
in the United States, may I say.

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:52.000
And I'm only showing you a little bit of this.

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:54.000
What is astonishing about companies

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:57.000
is that they scale sublinearly

00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:59.000
like biology,

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:01.000
indicating that they're dominated,

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:03.000
not by super-linear

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:06.000
innovation and ideas;

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:08.000
they become dominated

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:10.000
by economies of scale.

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:12.000
In that interpretation,

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:14.000
by bureaucracy and administration,

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:16.000
and they do it beautifully, may I say.

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:19.000
So if you tell me the size of some company, some small company,

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:22.000
I could have predicted the size of Walmart.

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:24.000
If it has this sublinear scaling,

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:26.000
the theory says

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:29.000
we should have sigmoidal growth.

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:31.000
There's Walmart. Doesn't look very sigmoidal.

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:34.000
That's what we like, hockey sticks.

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:36.000
But you notice, I've cheated,

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:38.000
because I've only gone up to '94.

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:40.000
Let's go up to 2008.

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:43.000
That red line is from the theory.

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:45.000
So if I'd have done this in 1994,

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:48.000
I could have predicted what Walmart would be now.

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:50.000
And then this is repeated

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:52.000
across the entire spectrum of companies.

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:55.000
There they are. That's 23,000 companies.

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:57.000
They all start looking like hockey sticks,

00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:59.000
they all bend over,

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:01.000
and they all die like you and me.

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:03.000
Thank you.

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:12.000
(Applause)
