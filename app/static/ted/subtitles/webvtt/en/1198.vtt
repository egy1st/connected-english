WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
I'm going to talk today

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
about the pleasures of everyday life.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
But I want to begin with a story

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
of an unusual and terrible man.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
This is Hermann Goering.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Goering was Hitler's second in command in World War II,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
his designated successor.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
And like Hitler,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Goering fancied himself a collector of art.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
He went through Europe, through World War II,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
stealing, extorting and occasionally buying

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
various paintings for his collection.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
And what he really wanted was something by Vermeer.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Hitler had two of them, and he didn't have any.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
So he finally found an art dealer,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
a Dutch art dealer named Han van Meegeren,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
who sold him a wonderful Vermeer

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
for the cost of what would now be 10 million dollars.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
And it was his favorite artwork ever.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
World War II came to an end,

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
and Goering was captured, tried at Nuremberg

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
and ultimately sentenced to death.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
Then the Allied forces went through his collections

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
and found the paintings

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
and went after the people who sold it to him.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
And at some point the Dutch police came into Amsterdam

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
and arrested Van Meegeren.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
Van Meegeren was charged with the crime of treason,

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
which is itself punishable by death.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
Six weeks into his prison sentence,

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
van Meegeren confessed.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
But he didn't confess to treason.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
He said, "I did not sell a great masterpiece

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
to that Nazi.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
I painted it myself; I'm a forger."

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
Now nobody believed him.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
And he said, "I'll prove it.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
Bring me a canvas and some paint,

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
and I will paint a Vermeer much better

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
than I sold that disgusting Nazi.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
I also need alcohol and morphine, because it's the only way I can work."

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
(Laughter)

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
So they brought him in.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
He painted a beautiful Vermeer.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
And then the charges of treason were dropped.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
He had a lesser charge of forgery,

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
got a year sentence

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
and died a hero to the Dutch people.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000
There's a lot more to be said about van Meegeren,

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
but I want to turn now to Goering,

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
who's pictured here being interrogated at Nuremberg.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
Now Goering was, by all accounts, a terrible man.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
Even for a Nazi, he was a terrible man.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
His American interrogators described him

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
as an amicable psychopath.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
But you could feel sympathy

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
for the reaction he had

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
when he was told that his favorite painting

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
was actually a forgery.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
According to his biographer,

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
"He looked as if for the first time

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
he had discovered there was evil in the world."

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000
(Laughter)

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000
And he killed himself soon afterwards.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
He had discovered after all

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
that the painting he thought was this

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000
was actually that.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
It looked the same,

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
but it had a different origin, it was a different artwork.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
It wasn't just him who was in for a shock.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000
Once van Meegeren was on trial, he couldn't stop talking.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000
And he boasted about all the great masterpieces

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
that he himself had painted

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
that were attributed to other artists.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
In particular, "The Supper at Emmaus"

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000
which was viewed as Vermeer's finest masterpiece, his best work --

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000
people would come [from] all over the world to see it --

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
was actually a forgery.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
It was not that painting, but that painting.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
And when that was discovered,

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000
it lost all its value and was taken away from the museum.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
Why does this matter?

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000
I'm a psychologists -- why do origins matter so much?

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000
Why do we respond so much

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.000
to our knowledge of where something comes from?

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000
Well there's an answer that many people would give.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.000
Many sociologists like Veblen and Wolfe

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.000
would argue that the reason why we take origins so seriously

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.000
is because we're snobs, because we're focused on status.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000
Among other things,

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000
if you want to show off how rich you are, how powerful you are,

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000
it's always better to own an original than a forgery

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.000
because there's always going to be fewer originals than forgeries.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000
I don't doubt that that plays some role,

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000
but what I want to convince you of today

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000
is that there's something else going on.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000
I want to convince you

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.000
that humans are, to some extent, natural born essentialists.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000
What I mean by this

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
is we don't just respond to things as we see them,

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
or feel them, or hear them.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.000
Rather, our response is conditioned on our beliefs,

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.000
about what they really are, what they came from,

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.000
what they're made of, what their hidden nature is.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000
I want to suggest that this is true,

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000
not just for how we think about things,

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000
but how we react to things.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000
So I want to suggest that pleasure is deep --

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000
and that this isn't true

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.000
just for higher level pleasures like art,

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.000
but even the most seemingly simple pleasures

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.000
are affected by our beliefs about hidden essences.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000
So take food.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000
Would you eat this?

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000
Well, a good answer is, "It depends. What is it?"

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000
Some of you would eat it if it's pork, but not beef.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.000
Some of you would eat it if it's beef, but not pork.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000
Few of you would eat it if it's a rat

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000
or a human.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000
Some of you would eat it only if it's a strangely colored piece of tofu.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000
That's not so surprising.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000
But what's more interesting

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000
is how it tastes to you

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.000
will depend critically on what you think you're eating.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.000
So one demonstration of this was done with young children.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000
How do you make children

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000
not just be more likely to eat carrots and drink milk,

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000
but to get more pleasure from eating carrots and drinking milk --

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000
to think they taste better?

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.000
It's simple, you tell them they're from McDonald's.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000
They believe McDonald's food is tastier,

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.000
and it leads them to experience it as tastier.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000
How do you get adults to really enjoy wine?

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000
It's very simple:

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000
pour it from an expensive bottle.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.000
There are now dozens, perhaps hundreds of studies showing

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000
that if you believe you're drinking the expensive stuff,

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000
it tastes better to you.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.000
This was recently done with a neuroscientific twist.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000
They get people into a fMRI scanner,

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000
and while they're lying there, through a tube,

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000
they get to sip wine.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.000
In front of them on a screen is information about the wine.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000
Everybody, of course,

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.000
drinks exactly the same wine.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.000
But if you believe you're drinking expensive stuff,

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.000
parts of the brain associated with pleasure and reward

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000
light up like a Christmas tree.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.000
It's not just that you say it's more pleasurable, you say you like it more,

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.000
you really experience it in a different way.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.000
Or take sex.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.000
These are stimuli I've used in some of my studies.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.000
And if you simply show people these pictures,

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.000
they'll say these are fairly attractive people.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.000
But how attractive you find them,

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.000
how sexually or romantically moved you are by them,

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.000
rests critically on who you think you're looking at.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.000
You probably think the picture on the left is male,

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000
the one on the right is female.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.000
If that belief turns out to be mistaken, it will make a difference.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000
(Laughter)

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000
It will make a difference if they turn out to be

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.000
much younger or much older than you think they are.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000
It will make a difference if you were to discover

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.000
that the person you're looking at with lust

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.000
is actually a disguised version of your son or daughter,

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.000
your mother or father.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.000
Knowing somebody's your kin typically kills the libido.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.000
Maybe one of the most heartening findings

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.000
from the psychology of pleasure

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:55.000
is there's more to looking good than your physical appearance.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.000
If you like somebody, they look better to you.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:01.000
This is why spouses in happy marriages

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.000
tend to think that their husband or wife

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.000
looks much better than anyone else thinks that they do.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.000
(Laughter)

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:11.000
A particularly dramatic example of this

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.000
comes from a neurological disorder known as Capgras syndrome.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.000
So Capgras syndrome is a disorder

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.000
where you get a specific delusion.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.000
Sufferers of Capgras syndrome

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.000
believe that the people they love most in the world

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.000
have been replaced by perfect duplicates.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:28.000
Now often, a result of Capgras syndrome is tragic.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000
People have murdered those that they loved,

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.000
believing that they were murdering an imposter.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.000
But there's at least one case

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.000
where Capgras syndrome had a happy ending.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.000
This was recorded in 1931.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.000
"Research described a woman with Capgras syndrome

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:45.000
who complained about her poorly endowed and sexually inadequate lover."

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.000
But that was before she got Capgras syndrome.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.000
After she got it, "She was happy to report

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:53.000
that she has discovered that he possessed a double

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.000
who was rich, virile, handsome and aristocratic."

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.000
Of course, it was the same man,

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.000
but she was seeing him in different ways.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.000
As a third example,

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.000
consider consumer products.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.000
So one reason why you might like something is its utility.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:09.000
You can put shoes on your feet; you can play golf with golf clubs;

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:12.000
and chewed up bubble gum doesn't do anything at all for you.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.000
But each of these three objects has value

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.000
above and beyond what it can do for you

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.000
based on its history.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:21.000
The golf clubs were owned by John F. Kennedy

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:24.000
and sold for three-quarters of a million dollars at auction.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.000
The bubble gum was chewed up by pop star Britney Spears

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.000
and sold for several hundreds of dollars.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000
And in fact, there's a thriving market

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:34.000
in the partially eaten food of beloved people.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.000
(Laughter)

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.000
The shoes are perhaps the most valuable of all.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.000
According to an unconfirmed report,

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.000
a Saudi millionaire offered 10 million dollars

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.000
for this pair of shoes.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:48.000
They were the ones thrown at George Bush

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000
at an Iraqi press conference several years ago.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.000
(Applause)

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.000
Now this attraction to objects

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.000
doesn't just work for celebrity objects.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.000
Each one of us, most people,

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:01.000
have something in our life that's literally irreplaceable,

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:04.000
in that it has value because of its history --

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:07.000
maybe your wedding ring, maybe your child's baby shoes --

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:10.000
so that if it was lost, you couldn't get it back.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.000
You could get something that looked like it or felt like it,

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.000
but you couldn't get the same object back.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:18.000
With my colleagues George Newman and Gil Diesendruck,

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:21.000
we've looked to see what sort of factors, what sort of history, matters

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.000
for the objects that people like.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.000
So in one of our experiments,

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:28.000
we asked people to name a famous person who they adored,

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.000
a living person they adored.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.000
So one answer was George Clooney.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.000
Then we asked them,

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.000
"How much would you pay for George Clooney's sweater?"

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.000
And the answer is a fair amount --

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:41.000
more than you would pay for a brand new sweater

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:44.000
or a sweater owned by somebody who you didn't adore.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.000
Then we asked other groups of subjects --

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.000
we gave them different restrictions

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.000
and different conditions.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.000
So for instance, we told some people,

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.000
"Look, you can buy the sweater,

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.000
but you can't tell anybody you own it,

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.000
and you can't resell it."

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.000
That drops the value of it,

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.000
suggesting that that's one reason why we like it.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.000
But what really causes an effect

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:08.000
is you tell people, "Look, you could resell it, you could boast about it,

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.000
but before it gets to you,

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.000
it's thoroughly washed."

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:15.000
That causes a huge drop in the value.

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:18.000
As my wife put it, "You've washed away the Clooney cooties."

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.000
(Laughter)

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.000
So let's go back to art.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.000
I would love a Chagall. I love the work of Chagall.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.000
If people want to get me something at the end of the conference,

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.000
you could buy me a Chagall.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.000
But I don't want a duplicate,

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.000
even if I can't tell the difference.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.000
That's not because, or it's not simply because,

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:37.000
I'm a snob and want to boast about having an original.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:40.000
Rather, it's because I want something that has a specific history.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.000
In the case of artwork,

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.000
the history is special indeed.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.000
The philosopher Denis Dutton

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.000
in his wonderful book "The Art Instinct"

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.000
makes the case that, "The value of an artwork

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:53.000
is rooted in assumptions about the human performance underlying its creation."

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.000
And that could explain the difference

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.000
between an original and a forgery.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.000
They may look alike, but they have a different history.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:02.000
The original is typically the product of a creative act,

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:04.000
the forgery isn't.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:07.000
I think this approach can explain differences

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.000
in people's taste in art.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.000
This is a work by Jackson Pollock.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:14.000
Who here likes the work of Jackson Pollock?

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.000
Okay. Who here, it does nothing for them?

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:20.000
They just don't like it.

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.000
I'm not going to make a claim about who's right,

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.000
but I will make an empirical claim

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.000
about people's intuitions,

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.000
which is that, if you like the work of Jackson Pollock,

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:31.000
you'll tend more so than the people who don't like it

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:34.000
to believe that these works are difficult to create,

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.000
that they require a lot of time and energy

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.000
and creative energy.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:41.000
I use Jackson Pollock on purpose as an example

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:43.000
because there's a young American artist

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.000
who paints very much in the style of Jackson Pollock,

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:47.000
and her work was worth

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.000
many tens of thousands of dollars --

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.000
in large part because she's a very young artist.

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.000
This is Marla Olmstead

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.000
who did most of her work when she was three years old.

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:57.000
The interesting thing about Marla Olmstead

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.000
is her family made the mistake

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:03.000
of inviting the television program 60 Minutes II into their house

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:05.000
to film her painting.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:08.000
And they then reported that her father was coaching her.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.000
When this came out on television,

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:13.000
the value of her art dropped to nothing.

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:15.000
It was the same art, physically,

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:18.000
but the history had changed.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.000
I've been focusing now on the visual arts,

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.000
but I want to give two examples from music.

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:24.000
This is Joshua Bell, a very famous violinist.

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:27.000
And the Washington Post reporter Gene Weingarten

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:30.000
decided to enlist him for an audacious experiment.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.000
The question is: How much would people like Joshua Bell,

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.000
the music of Joshua Bell,

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:37.000
if they didn't know they were listening to Joshua Bell?

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:41.000
So he got Joshua Bell to take his million dollar violin

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:44.000
down to a Washington D.C. subway station

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:47.000
and stand in the corner and see how much money he would make.

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:49.000
And here's a brief clip of this.

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:56.000
(Violin music)

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.000
After being there for three-quarters of an hour,

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:01.000
he made 32 dollars.

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:03.000
Not bad. It's also not good.

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:06.000
Apparently to really enjoy the music of Joshua Bell,

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:09.000
you have to know you're listening to Joshua Bell.

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:11.000
He actually made 20 dollars more than that,

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:13.000
but he didn't count it.

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:15.000
Because this woman comes up --

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:17.000
you see at the end of the video -- she comes up.

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:19.000
She had heard him at the Library of Congress a few weeks before

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:22.000
at this extravagant black-tie affair.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:25.000
So she's stunned that he's standing in a subway station.

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:27.000
So she's struck with pity.

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:29.000
She reaches into her purse and hands him a 20.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:31.000
(Laughter)

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.000
(Applause)

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:35.000
The second example from music

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:37.000
is from John Cage's modernist composition,

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:39.000
"4'33"."

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:41.000
As many of you know,

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:44.000
this is the composition where the pianist sits at a bench,

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:46.000
opens up the piano

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.000
and sits and does nothing for four minutes and 33 seconds --

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.000
that period of silence.

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.000
And people have different views on this.

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:54.000
But what I want to point out

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.000
is you can buy this from iTunes.

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:58.000
(Laughter)

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:00.000
For a dollar 99,

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.000
you can listen to that silence,

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:05.000
which is different than other forms of silence.

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:07.000
(Laughter)

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:10.000
Now I've been talking so far about pleasure,

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:12.000
but what I want to suggest

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:15.000
is that everything I've said applies as well to pain.

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:17.000
And how you think about what you're experiencing,

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:19.000
your beliefs about the essence of it,

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:21.000
affect how it hurts.

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:23.000
One lovely experiment

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:25.000
was done by Kurt Gray and Dan Wegner.

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:27.000
What they did was they hooked up Harvard undergraduates

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:29.000
to an electric shock machine.

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:32.000
And they gave them a series of painful electric shocks.

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:35.000
So it was a series of five painful shocks.

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:37.000
Half of them are told that they're being given the shocks

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.000
by somebody in another room,

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:42.000
but the person in the other room doesn't know they're giving them shocks.

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:44.000
There's no malevolence, they're just pressing a button.

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:47.000
The first shock is recorded as very painful.

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:50.000
The second shock feels less painful, because you get a bit used to it.

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:52.000
The third drops, the fourth, the fifth.

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:55.000
The pain gets less.

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:57.000
In the other condition,

00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:59.000
they're told that the person in the next room

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:02.000
is shocking them on purpose -- knows they're shocking them.

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:04.000
The first shock hurts like hell.

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:06.000
The second shock hurts just as much,

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:08.000
and the third and the fourth and the fifth.

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:10.000
It hurts more

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:13.000
if you believe somebody is doing it to you on purpose.

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:16.000
The most extreme example of this

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:18.000
is that in some cases,

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.000
pain under the right circumstances

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:22.000
can transform into pleasure.

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:25.000
Humans have this extraordinarily interesting property

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:27.000
that will often seek out low-level doses of pain

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:29.000
in controlled circumstances

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:31.000
and take pleasure from it --

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:33.000
as in the eating of hot chili peppers

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:36.000
and roller coaster rides.

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:38.000
The point was nicely summarized

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:40.000
by the poet John Milton

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:42.000
who wrote, "The mind is its own place,

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:44.000
and in itself can make a heaven of hell,

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:46.000
a hell of heaven."

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:48.000
And I'll end with that. Thank you.

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:55.000
(Applause)
