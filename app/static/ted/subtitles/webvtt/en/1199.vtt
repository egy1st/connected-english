WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Well after many years working in trade and economics,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
four years ago,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
I found myself working on the front lines

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
of human vulnerability.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
And I found myself in the places

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
where people are fighting every day to survive

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
and can't even obtain a meal.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
This red cup comes from Rwanda

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
from a child named Fabian.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
And I carry this around

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
as a symbol, really, of the challenge

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
and also the hope.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Because one cup of food a day

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
changes Fabian's life completely.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
But what I'd like to talk about today

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
is the fact that this morning,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
about a billion people on Earth --

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
or one out of every seven --

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
woke up and didn't even know

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
how to fill this cup.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
One out of every seven people.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
First, I'll ask you: Why should you care?

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
Why should we care?

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
For most people,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
if they think about hunger,

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
they don't have to go far back on their own family history --

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
maybe in their own lives, or their parents' lives,

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
or their grandparents' lives --

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
to remember an experience of hunger.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
I rarely find an audience

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
where people can go back very far without that experience.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
Some are driven by compassion,

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
feel it's perhaps

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
one of the fundamental acts of humanity.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
As Gandhi said,

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.000
"To a hungry man, a piece of bread is the face of God."

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
Others worry about peace and security,

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
stability in the world.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000
We saw the food riots in 2008,

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
after what I call the silent tsunami of hunger

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
swept the globe when food prices doubled overnight.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
The destabilizing effects of hunger

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
are known throughout human history.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
One of the most fundamental acts of civilization

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000
is to ensure people can get enough food.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000
Others think about Malthusian nightmares.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000
Will we be able to feed a population

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
that will be nine billion in just a few decades?

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
This is not a negotiable thing, hunger.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
People have to eat.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
There's going to be a lot of people.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000
This is jobs and opportunity all the way up and down the value chain.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
But I actually came to this issue

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000
in a different way.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000
This is a picture of me and my three children.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
In 1987, I was a new mother

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
with my first child

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
and was holding her and feeding her

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
when an image very similar to this

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
came on the television.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
And this was yet another famine in Ethiopia.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
One two years earlier

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000
had killed more than a million people.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000
But it never struck me as it did that moment,

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
because on that image

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
was a woman trying to nurse her baby,

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.000
and she had no milk to nurse.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.000
And the baby's cry really penetrated me,

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
as a mother.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
And I thought, there's nothing more haunting

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
than the cry of a child

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:06.000
that cannot be returned with food --

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
the most fundamental expectation of every human being.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
And it was at that moment

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000
that I just was filled

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000
with the challenge and the outrage

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
that actually we know how to fix this problem.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
This isn't one of those rare diseases

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000
that we don't have the solution for.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
We know how to fix hunger.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
A hundred years ago, we didn't.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.000
We actually have the technology and systems.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.000
And I was just struck

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000
that this is out of place.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000
At our time in history, these images are out of place.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000
Well guess what?

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.000
This is last week in northern Kenya.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000
Yet again,

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000
the face of starvation

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000
at large scale

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.000
with more than nine million people

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.000
wondering if they can make it to the next day.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000
In fact,

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000
what we know now

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
is that every 10 seconds

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000
we lose a child to hunger.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000
This is more

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000
than HIV/AIDS,

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000
malaria and tuberculosis combined.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000
And we know that the issue

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.000
is not just production of food.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000
One of my mentors in life

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.000
was Norman Borlaug, my hero.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.000
But today I'm going to talk about access to food,

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.000
because actually this year and last year

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
and during the 2008 food crisis,

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
there was enough food on Earth

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.000
for everyone to have 2,700 kilocalories.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.000
So why is it

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000
that we have a billion people

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000
who can't find food?

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000
And I also want to talk about

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000
what I call our new burden of knowledge.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000
In 2008,

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.000
Lancet compiled all the research

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:55.000
and put forward the compelling evidence

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.000
that if a child in its first thousand days --

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.000
from conception to two years old --

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000
does not have adequate nutrition,

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000
the damage is irreversible.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.000
Their brains and bodies will be stunted.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.000
And here you see a brain scan of two children --

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000
one who had adequate nutrition,

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000
another, neglected

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000
and who was deeply malnourished.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000
And we can see brain volumes

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.000
up to 40 percent less

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000
in these children.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000
And in this slide

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.000
you see the neurons and the synapses of the brain

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000
don't form.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.000
And what we know now is this has huge impact on economies,

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000
which I'll talk about later.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.000
But also the earning potential of these children

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.000
is cut in half in their lifetime

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.000
due to the stunting

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000
that happens in early years.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.000
So this burden of knowledge drives me.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.000
Because actually we know how to fix it

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.000
very simply.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000
And yet, in many places,

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000
a third of the children,

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000
by the time they're three

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000
already are facing a life of hardship

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000
due to this.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000
I'd like to talk about

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.000
some of the things I've seen on the front lines of hunger,

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.000
some of the things I've learned

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.000
in bringing my economic and trade knowledge

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:19.000
and my experience in the private sector.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.000
I'd like to talk about where the gap of knowledge is.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.000
Well first, I'd like to talk about the oldest nutritional method on Earth,

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000
breastfeeding.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.000
You may be surprised to know

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.000
that a child could be saved every 22 seconds

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.000
if there was breastfeeding in the first six months of life.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.000
But in Niger, for example,

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.000
less than seven percent of the children

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.000
are breastfed

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.000
for the first six months of life, exclusively.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:52.000
In Mauritania, less than three percent.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:56.000
This is something that can be transformed with knowledge.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.000
This message, this word, can come out

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:01.000
that this is not an old-fashioned way of doing business;

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.000
it's a brilliant way

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.000
of saving your child's life.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:08.000
And so today we focus on not just passing out food,

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:11.000
but making sure the mothers have enough enrichment,

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.000
and teaching them about breastfeeding.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.000
The second thing I'd like to talk about:

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.000
If you were living in a remote village somewhere,

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.000
your child was limp,

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:23.000
and you were in a drought, or you were in floods,

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:26.000
or you were in a situation where there wasn't adequate diversity of diet,

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.000
what would you do?

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000
Do you think you could go to the store

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.000
and get a choice of power bars, like we can,

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.000
and pick the right one to match?

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.000
Well I find parents out on the front lines

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:41.000
very aware their children are going down for the count.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:44.000
And I go to those shops, if there are any,

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:47.000
or out to the fields to see what they can get,

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:50.000
and they cannot obtain the nutrition.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:53.000
Even if they know what they need to do, it's not available.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.000
And I'm very excited about this,

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:58.000
because one thing we're working on

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:01.000
is transforming the technologies

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.000
that are very available

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.000
in the food industry

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:08.000
to be available for traditional crops.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:11.000
And this is made with chickpeas, dried milk

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.000
and a host of vitamins,

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.000
matched to exactly what the brain needs.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.000
It costs 17 cents for us to produce this

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:21.000
as, what I call, food for humanity.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.000
We did this with food technologists

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:26.000
in India and Pakistan --

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000
really about three of them.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.000
But this is transforming

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000
99 percent of the kids who get this.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:35.000
One package, 17 cents a day --

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.000
their malnutrition is overcome.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.000
So I am convinced

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.000
that if we can unlock the technologies

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.000
that are commonplace in the richer world

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.000
to be able to transform foods.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.000
And this is climate-proof.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000
It doesn't need to be refrigerated, it doesn't need water,

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.000
which is often lacking.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.000
And these types of technologies,

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.000
I see, have the potential

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:00.000
to transform the face of hunger and nutrition, malnutrition

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.000
out on the front lines.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.000
The next thing I want to talk about is school feeding.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.000
Eighty percent of the people in the world

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.000
have no food safety net.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.000
When disaster strikes --

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.000
the economy gets blown, people lose a job,

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.000
floods, war, conflict,

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.000
bad governance, all of those things --

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.000
there is nothing to fall back on.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.000
And usually the institutions --

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.000
churches, temples, other things --

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.000
do not have the resources

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.000
to provide a safety net.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.000
What we have found working with the World Bank

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.000
is that the poor man's safety net,

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.000
the best investment, is school feeding.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.000
And if you fill the cup

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:40.000
with local agriculture from small farmers,

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.000
you have a transformative effect.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.000
Many kids in the world can't go to school

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.000
because they have to go beg and find a meal.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.000
But when that food is there,

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.000
it's transformative.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:54.000
It costs less than 25 cents a day to change a kid's life.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:57.000
But what is most amazing is the effect on girls.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:01.000
In countries where girls don't go to school

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:04.000
and you offer a meal to girls in school,

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.000
we see enrollment rates

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.000
about 50 percent girls and boys.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:11.000
We see a transformation in attendance by girls.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.000
And there was no argument,

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.000
because it's incentive.

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:17.000
Families need the help.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.000
And we find that if we keep girls in school later,

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.000
they'll stay in school until they're 16,

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:24.000
and won't get married if there's food in school.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.000
Or if they get an extra ration of food

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.000
at the end of the week --

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.000
it costs about 50 cents --

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.000
will keep a girl in school,

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.000
and they'll give birth to a healthier child,

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:37.000
because the malnutrition is sent

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:40.000
generation to generation.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.000
We know that there's boom and bust cycles of hunger.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.000
We know this.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:47.000
Right now on the Horn of Africa, we've been through this before.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.000
So is this a hopeless cause?

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.000
Absolutely not.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:56.000
I'd like to talk about what I call our warehouses for hope.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:59.000
Cameroon, northern Cameroon, boom and bust cycles of hunger

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.000
every year for decades.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:04.000
Food aid coming in every year

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:08.000
when people are starving during the lean seasons.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.000
Well two years ago,

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:14.000
we decided, let's transform the model of fighting hunger,

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:17.000
and instead of giving out the food aid, we put it into food banks.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.000
And we said, listen,

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.000
during the lean season, take the food out.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:24.000
You manage, the village manages these warehouses.

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.000
And during harvest, put it back with interest,

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.000
food interest.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:32.000
So add in five percent, 10 percent more food.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.000
For the past two years,

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.000
500 of these villages where these are

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.000
have not needed any food aid -- they're self-sufficient.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.000
And the food banks are growing.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:43.000
And they're starting school feeding programs for their children

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.000
by the people in the village.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:47.000
But they've never had the ability

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.000
to build even the basic infrastructure

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.000
or the resources.

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.000
I love this idea that came from the village level:

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:56.000
three keys to unlock that warehouse.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.000
Food is gold there.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:01.000
And simple ideas can transform the face,

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.000
not of small areas,

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:05.000
of big areas of the world.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:09.000
I'd like to talk about what I call digital food.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:12.000
Technology is transforming

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.000
the face of food vulnerability

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.000
in places where you see classic famine.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.000
Amartya Sen won his Nobel Prize

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:22.000
for saying, "Guess what, famines happen in the presence of food

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:25.000
because people have no ability to buy it."

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.000
We certainly saw that in 2008.

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:29.000
We're seeing that now in the Horn of Africa

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:32.000
where food prices are up 240 percent in some areas

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.000
over last year.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.000
Food can be there and people can't buy it.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:40.000
Well this picture -- I was in Hebron in a small shop, this shop,

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:43.000
where instead of bringing in food,

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:46.000
we provide digital food, a card.

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:49.000
It says "bon appetit" in Arabic.

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:52.000
And the women can go in and swipe

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.000
and get nine food items.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.000
They have to be nutritious,

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.000
and they have to be locally produced.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.000
And what's happened in the past year alone

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.000
is the dairy industry --

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:05.000
where this card's used for milk and yogurt

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:07.000
and eggs and hummus --

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:10.000
the dairy industry has gone up 30 percent.

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.000
The shopkeepers are hiring more people.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.000
It is a win-win-win situation

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:17.000
that starts the food economy moving.

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:20.000
We now deliver food in over 30 countries

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:23.000
over cell phones,

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:27.000
transforming even the presence of refugees in countries,

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:29.000
and other ways.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:31.000
Perhaps most exciting to me

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:34.000
is an idea that Bill Gates, Howard Buffett and others

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:36.000
have supported boldly,

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.000
which is to ask the question:

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:41.000
What if, instead of looking at the hungry as victims --

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:43.000
and most of them are small farmers

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:46.000
who cannot raise enough food or sell food

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.000
to even support their own families --

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:51.000
what if we view them as the solution,

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:53.000
as the value chain to fight hunger?

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:58.000
What if from the women in Africa

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:00.000
who cannot sell any food --

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.000
there's no roads, there's no warehouses,

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:05.000
there's not even a tarp to pick the food up with --

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:07.000
what if we give the enabling environment

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:09.000
for them to provide the food

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:12.000
to feed the hungry children elsewhere?

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:15.000
And Purchasing for Progress today is in 21 countries.

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:17.000
And guess what?

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:19.000
In virtually every case,

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:22.000
when poor farmers are given a guaranteed market --

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:25.000
if you say, "We will buy 300 metric tons of this.

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:28.000
We'll pick it up. We'll make sure it's stored properly." --

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:31.000
their yields have gone up two-, three-, fourfold

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:33.000
and they figure it out,

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:36.000
because it's the first guaranteed opportunity they've had in their life.

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:39.000
And we're seeing people transform their lives.

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:42.000
Today, food aid, our food aid --

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:44.000
huge engine --

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:47.000
80 percent of it is bought in the developing world.

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:49.000
Total transformation

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:53.000
that can actually transform the very lives that need the food.

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:56.000
Now you'd ask, can this be done at scale?

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:59.000
These are great ideas, village-level ideas.

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:01.000
Well I'd like to talk about Brazil,

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:04.000
because I've taken a journey to Brazil over the past couple of years,

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:06.000
when I read that Brazil was defeating hunger

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:08.000
faster than any nation on Earth right now.

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:10.000
And what I've found is,

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:12.000
rather than investing their money in food subsidies

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:14.000
and other things,

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:16.000
they invested in a school feeding program.

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:18.000
And they require that a third of that food

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:21.000
come from the smallest farmers who would have no opportunity.

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:23.000
And they're doing this at huge scale

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:26.000
after President Lula declared his goal

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:29.000
of ensuring everyone had three meals a day.

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:33.000
And this zero hunger program

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:36.000
costs .5 percent of GDP

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:41.000
and has lifted many millions of people

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:43.000
out of hunger and poverty.

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:46.000
It is transforming the face of hunger in Brazil,

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:49.000
and it's at scale, and it's creating opportunities.

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:52.000
I've gone out there; I've met with the small farmers

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:54.000
who have built their livelihoods

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:56.000
on the opportunity and platform

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:59.000
provided by this.

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:01.000
Now if we look at the economic imperative here,

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:04.000
this isn't just about compassion.

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:06.000
The fact is studies show

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:09.000
that the cost of malnutrition and hunger --

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:11.000
the cost to society,

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:13.000
the burden it has to bear --

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:15.000
is on average six percent,

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:17.000
and in some countries up to 11 percent,

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:20.000
of GDP a year.

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:23.000
And if you look at the 36 countries

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:25.000
with the highest burden of malnutrition,

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:28.000
that's 260 billion lost from a productive economy

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:30.000
every year.

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:32.000
Well, the World Bank estimates

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:34.000
it would take about 10 billion dollars --

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:36.000
10.3 --

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:38.000
to address malnutrition in those countries.

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:40.000
You look at the cost-benefit analysis,

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:43.000
and my dream is to take this issue,

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:46.000
not just from the compassion argument,

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:48.000
but to the finance ministers of the world,

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:50.000
and say we cannot afford

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:52.000
to not invest

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:55.000
in the access to adequate, affordable nutrition

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:58.000
for all of humanity.

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:01.000
The amazing thing I've found

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:04.000
is nothing can change on a big scale

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:06.000
without the determination of a leader.

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:09.000
When a leader says, "Not under my watch,"

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:11.000
everything begins to change.

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:13.000
And the world can come in

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:16.000
with enabling environments and opportunities to do this.

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:18.000
And the fact that France

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:20.000
has put food at the center of the G20

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:22.000
is really important.

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:24.000
Because food is one issue

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:27.000
that cannot be solved person by person, nation by nation.

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:29.000
We have to stand together.

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:31.000
And we're seeing nations in Africa.

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:34.000
WFP's been able to leave 30 nations

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:36.000
because they have transformed

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:38.000
the face of hunger in their nations.

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:41.000
What I would like to offer here is a challenge.

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:46.000
I believe we're living at a time in human history

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:49.000
where it's just simply unacceptable

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:51.000
that children wake up

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:53.000
and don't know where to find a cup of food.

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:55.000
Not only that,

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:57.000
transforming hunger

00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:59.000
is an opportunity,

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:02.000
but I think we have to change our mindsets.

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:04.000
I am so honored to be here

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:08.000
with some of the world's top innovators and thinkers.

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:12.000
And I would like you to join with all of humanity

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:14.000
to draw a line in the sand

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:16.000
and say, "No more.

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:18.000
No more are we going to accept this."

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:20.000
And we want to tell our grandchildren

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:22.000
that there was a terrible time in history

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:24.000
where up to a third of the children

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:26.000
had brains and bodies that were stunted,

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:28.000
but that exists no more.

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:30.000
Thank you.

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:48.000
(Applause)
