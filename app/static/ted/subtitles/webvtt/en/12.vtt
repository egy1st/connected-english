WEBVTT

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Thank you. It's really an honor and a privilege to be here

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
spending my last day as a teenager.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Today I want to talk to you about the future, but

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
first I'm going to tell you a bit about the past.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
My story starts way before I was born.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
My grandmother was on a train to Auschwitz, the death camp.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.000
And she was going along the tracks, and the tracks split.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.000
And somehow -- we don't really know exactly the whole story -- but

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.000
the train took the wrong track and went to a work camp rather than the death camp.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.000
My grandmother survived and married my grandfather.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
They were living in Hungary, and my mother was born.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
And when my mother was two years old,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.000
the Hungarian revolution was raging, and they decided to escape Hungary.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000
They got on a boat, and yet another divergence --

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
the boat was either going to Canada or to Australia.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
They got on and didn't know where they were going, and ended up in Canada.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
So, to make a long story short, they came to Canada.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000
My grandmother was a chemist. She worked at the Banting Institute in Toronto,

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:19.000
and at 44 she died of stomach cancer. I never met my grandmother,

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.000
but I carry on her name -- her exact name, Eva Vertes --

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.000
and I like to think I carry on her scientific passion, too.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:33.000
I found this passion not far from here, actually, when I was nine years old.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.000
My family was on a road trip and we were in the Grand Canyon.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
And I had never been a reader when I was young --

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
my dad had tried me with the Hardy Boys; I tried Nancy Drew;

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000
I tried all that -- and I just didn't like reading books.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000
And my mother bought this book when we were at the Grand Canyon

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
called "The Hot Zone." It was all about the outbreak of the Ebola virus.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
And something about it just kind of drew me towards it.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
There was this big sort of bumpy-looking virus on the cover,

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.000
and I just wanted to read it. I picked up that book,

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000
and as we drove from the edge of the Grand Canyon

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000
to Big Sur, and to, actually, here where we are today, in Monterey,

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:16.000
I read that book, and from when I was reading that book,

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000
I knew that I wanted to have a life in medicine.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000
I wanted to be like the explorers I'd read about in the book,

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
who went into the jungles of Africa,

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
went into the research labs and just tried to figure out

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:32.000
what this deadly virus was. So from that moment on, I read every medical book

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.000
I could get my hands on, and I just loved it so much.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.000
I was a passive observer of the medical world.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.000
It wasn't until I entered high school that I thought,

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000
"Maybe now, you know -- being a big high school kid --

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:52.000
I can maybe become an active part of this big medical world."

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:57.000
I was 14, and I emailed professors at the local university

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:02.000
to see if maybe I could go work in their lab. And hardly anyone responded.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.000
But I mean, why would they respond to a 14-year-old, anyway?

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.000
And I got to go talk to one professor, Dr. Jacobs,

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000
who accepted me into the lab.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000
At that time, I was really interested in neuroscience

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000
and wanted to do a research project in neurology --

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:24.000
specifically looking at the effects of heavy metals on the developing nervous system.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:29.000
So I started that, and worked in his lab for a year,

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.000
and found the results that I guess you'd expect to find

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:38.000
when you feed fruit flies heavy metals -- that it really, really impaired the nervous system.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.000
The spinal cord had breaks. The neurons were crossing in every which way.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:47.000
And from then I wanted to look not at impairment, but at prevention of impairment.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:53.000
So that's what led me to Alzheimer's. I started reading about Alzheimer's

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.000
and tried to familiarize myself with the research,

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000
and at the same time when I was in the --

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000
I was reading in the medical library one day, and I read this article

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000
about something called "purine derivatives."

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:08.000
And they seemed to have cell growth-promoting properties.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.000
And being naive about the whole field, I kind of thought,

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000
"Oh, you have cell death in Alzheimer's

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:18.000
which is causing the memory deficit, and then you have this compound --

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000
purine derivatives -- that are promoting cell growth."

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.000
And so I thought, "Maybe if it can promote cell growth,

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.000
it can inhibit cell death, too."

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.000
And so that's the project that I pursued for that year,

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000
and it's continuing now as well,

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:36.000
and found that a specific purine derivative called "guanidine"

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.000
had inhibited the cell growth by approximately 60 percent.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:43.000
So I presented those results at the International Science Fair,

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:47.000
which was just one of the most amazing experiences of my life.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.000
And there I was awarded "Best in the World in Medicine,"

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:57.000
which allowed me to get in, or at least get a foot in the door of the big medical world.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:03.000
And from then on, since I was now in this huge exciting world,

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:08.000
I wanted to explore it all. I wanted it all at once, but knew I couldn't really get that.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000
And I stumbled across something called "cancer stem cells."

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:14.000
And this is really what I want to talk to you about today -- about cancer.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:18.000
At first when I heard of cancer stem cells,

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:22.000
I didn't really know how to put the two together. I'd heard of stem cells,

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.000
and I'd heard of them as the panacea of the future --

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.000
the therapy of many diseases to come in the future, perhaps.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:32.000
But I'd heard of cancer as the most feared disease of our time,

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:36.000
so how did the good and bad go together?

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:42.000
Last summer I worked at Stanford University, doing some research on cancer stem cells.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.000
And while I was doing this, I was reading the cancer literature,

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:50.000
trying to -- again -- familiarize myself with this new medical field.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:58.000
And it seemed that tumors actually begin from a stem cell.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:05.000
This fascinated me. The more I read, the more I looked at cancer differently

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000
and almost became less fearful of it.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:13.000
It seems that cancer is a direct result to injury.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:18.000
If you smoke, you damage your lung tissue, and then lung cancer arises.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:23.000
If you drink, you damage your liver, and then liver cancer occurs.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.000
And it was really interesting -- there were articles correlating

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.000
if you have a bone fracture, and then bone cancer arises.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:33.000
Because what stem cells are -- they're these

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:37.000
phenomenal cells that really have the ability to differentiate

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000
into any type of tissue.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:44.000
So, if the body is sensing that you have damage to an organ

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:49.000
and then it's initiating cancer, it's almost as if this is a repair response.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:54.000
And the cancer, the body is saying the lung tissue is damaged,

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:58.000
we need to repair the lung. And cancer is originating in the lung

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:02.000
trying to repair -- because you have this excessive proliferation

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:07.000
of these remarkable cells that really have the potential to become lung tissue.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:11.000
But it's almost as if the body has originated this ingenious response,

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.000
but can't quite control it.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:18.000
It hasn't yet become fine-tuned enough to finish what has been initiated.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.000
So this really, really fascinated me.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:26.000
And I really think that we can't think about cancer --

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.000
let alone any disease -- in such black-and-white terms.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:35.000
If we eliminate cancer the way we're trying to do now, with chemotherapy and radiation,

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:40.000
we're bombarding the body or the cancer with toxins, or with radiation, trying to kill it.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.000
It's almost as if we're getting back to this starting point.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:48.000
We're removing the cancer cells, but we're revealing the previous damage

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.000
that the body has tried to fix.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:55.000
Shouldn't we think about manipulation, rather than elimination?

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:59.000
If somehow we can cause these cells to differentiate --

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:02.000
to become bone tissue, lung tissue, liver tissue,

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:05.000
whatever that cancer has been put there to do --

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:14.000
it would be a repair process. We'd end up better than we were before cancer.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:18.000
So, this really changed my view of looking at cancer.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:23.000
And while I was reading all these articles about cancer,

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.000
it seemed that the articles -- a lot of them -- focused on, you know,

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.000
the genetics of breast cancer, and the genesis

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.000
and the progression of breast cancer --

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:35.000
tracking the cancer through the body, tracing where it is, where it goes.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:40.000
But it struck me that I'd never heard of cancer of the heart,

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:43.000
or cancer of any skeletal muscle for that matter.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:47.000
And skeletal muscle constitutes 50 percent of our body,

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:52.000
or over 50 percent of our body. And so at first I kind of thought,

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.000
"Well, maybe there's some obvious explanation

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:58.000
why skeletal muscle doesn't get cancer -- at least not that I know of."

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:03.000
So, I looked further into it, found as many articles as I could,

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:07.000
and it was amazing -- because it turned out that it was very rare.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:11.000
Some articles even went as far as to say that skeletal muscle tissue

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:16.000
is resistant to cancer, and furthermore, not only to cancer,

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:20.000
but of metastases going to skeletal muscle.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:23.000
And what metastases are is when the tumor --

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:26.000
when a piece -- breaks off and travels through the blood stream

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:30.000
and goes to a different organ. That's what a metastasis is.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:33.000
It's the part of cancer that is the most dangerous.

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:36.000
If cancer was localized, we could likely remove it,

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:40.000
or somehow -- you know, it's contained. It's very contained.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:43.000
But once it starts moving throughout the body, that's when it becomes deadly.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:48.000
So the fact that not only did cancer not seem to originate in skeletal muscles,

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:51.000
but cancer didn't seem to go to skeletal muscle --

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.000
there seemed to be something here.

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.000
So these articles were saying, you know, "Skeletal --

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:58.000
metastasis to skeletal muscle -- is very rare."

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:02.000
But it was left at that. No one seemed to be asking why.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:09.000
So I decided to ask why. At first -- the first thing I did

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.000
was I emailed some professors who

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:14.000
specialized in skeletal muscle physiology, and pretty much said,

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:20.000
"Hey, it seems like cancer doesn't really go to skeletal muscle.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:24.000
Is there a reason for this?" And a lot of the replies I got were that

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:28.000
muscle is terminally differentiated tissue.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:31.000
Meaning that you have muscle cells, but they're not dividing,

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:35.000
so it doesn't seem like a good target for cancer to hijack.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:38.000
But then again, this fact that the metastases

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:42.000
didn't go to skeletal muscle made that seem unlikely.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:47.000
And furthermore, that nervous tissue -- brain -- gets cancer,

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:50.000
and brain cells are also terminally differentiated.

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:56.000
So I decided to ask why. And here's some of, I guess, my hypotheses

00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:05.000
that I'll be starting to investigate this May at the Sylvester Cancer Institute in Miami.

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:10.000
And I guess I'll keep investigating until I get the answers.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:13.000
But I know that in science, once you get the answers,

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.000
inevitably you're going to have more questions.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:20.000
So I guess you could say that I'll probably be doing this for the rest of my life.

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:23.000
Some of my hypotheses are that

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:26.000
when you first think about skeletal muscle,

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:29.000
there's a lot of blood vessels going to skeletal muscle.

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:33.000
And the first thing that makes me think is that

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:36.000
blood vessels are like highways for the tumor cells.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.000
Tumor cells can travel through the blood vessels.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:42.000
And you think, the more highways there are in a tissue,

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:46.000
the more likely it is to get cancer or to get metastases.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:49.000
So first of all I thought, you know, "Wouldn't it be favorable

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:52.000
to cancer getting to skeletal muscle?" And as well,

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:57.000
cancer tumors require a process called angiogenesis,

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:01.000
which is really, the tumor recruits the blood vessels to itself

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:04.000
to supply itself with nutrients so it can grow.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:11.000
Without angiogenesis, the tumor remains the size of a pinpoint and it's not harmful.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:17.000
So angiogenesis is really a central process to the pathogenesis of cancer.

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:20.000
And one article that really stood out to me

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:24.000
when I was just reading about this, trying to figure out why cancer doesn't go to skeletal

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:31.000
muscle, was that it had reported 16 percent of micro-metastases

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:33.000
to skeletal muscle upon autopsy.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:38.000
16 percent! Meaning that there were these pinpoint tumors in skeletal muscle,

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:43.000
but only .16 percent of actual metastases --

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:49.000
suggesting that maybe skeletal muscle is able to control the angiogenesis,

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:54.000
is able to control the tumors recruiting these blood vessels.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:59.000
We use skeletal muscles so much. It's the one portion of our body --

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:02.000
our heart's always beating. We're always moving our muscles.

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:06.000
Is it possible that muscle somehow intuitively knows

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:10.000
that it needs this blood supply? It needs to be constantly contracting,

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:13.000
so therefore it's almost selfish. It's grabbing its blood vessels for itself.

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:17.000
Therefore, when a tumor comes into skeletal muscle tissue,

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:20.000
it can't get a blood supply, and can't grow.

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:25.000
So this suggests that maybe if there is an anti-angiogenic factor

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:27.000
in skeletal muscle -- or perhaps even more,

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:32.000
an angiogenic routing factor, so it can actually direct where the blood vessels grow --

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:36.000
this could be a potential future therapy for cancer.

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:41.000
And another thing that's really interesting is that

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:45.000
there's this whole -- the way tumors move throughout the body,

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:49.000
it's a very complex system -- and there's something called the chemokine network.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:53.000
And chemokines are essentially chemical attractants,

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:56.000
and they're the stop and go signals for cancer.

00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:01.000
So a tumor expresses chemokine receptors,

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:04.000
and another organ -- a distant organ somewhere in the body --

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:06.000
will have the corresponding chemokines,

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:10.000
and the tumor will see these chemokines and migrate towards it.

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:15.000
Is it possible that skeletal muscle doesn't express this type of molecules?

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:18.000
And the other really interesting thing is that

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:22.000
when skeletal muscle -- there's been several reports that when skeletal

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:29.000
muscle is injured, that's what correlates with metastases going to skeletal muscle.

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:32.000
And, furthermore, when skeletal muscle is injured,

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:36.000
that's what causes chemokines -- these signals saying,

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:40.000
"Cancer, you can come to me," the "go signs" for the tumors --

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:44.000
it causes them to highly express these chemokines.

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:51.000
So, there's so much interplay here.

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:53.000
I mean, there are so many possibilities

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:56.000
for why tumors don't go to skeletal muscle.

00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:00.000
But it seems like by investigating, by attacking cancer,

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:04.000
by searching where cancer is not, there has got to be something --

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:10.000
there's got to be something -- that's making this tissue resistant to tumors.

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:13.000
And can we utilize -- can we take this property,

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:17.000
this compound, this receptor, whatever it is that's controlling these

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:24.000
anti-tumor properties and apply it to cancer therapy in general?

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:32.000
Now, one thing that kind of ties the resistance of skeletal muscle to cancer --

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:37.000
to the cancer as a repair response gone out of control in the body --

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:45.000
is that skeletal muscle has a factor in it called "MyoD."

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:50.000
And what MyoD essentially does is, it causes cells to differentiate

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:55.000
into muscle cells. So this compound, MyoD,

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:59.000
has been tested on a lot of different cell types and been shown to

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:03.000
actually convert this variety of cell types into skeletal muscle cells.

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:09.000
So, is it possible that the tumor cells are going to the skeletal muscle tissue,

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:13.000
but once in contact inside the skeletal muscle tissue,

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:18.000
MyoD acts upon these tumor cells and causes them

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:21.000
to become skeletal muscle cells?

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:24.000
Maybe tumor cells are being disguised as skeletal muscle cells,

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:29.000
and this is why it seems as if it is so rare.

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:32.000
It's not harmful; it has just repaired the muscle.

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:35.000
Muscle is constantly being used -- constantly being damaged.

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:38.000
If every time we tore a muscle

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:41.000
or every time we stretched a muscle or moved in a wrong way,

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:48.000
cancer occurred -- I mean, everybody would have cancer almost.

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:52.000
And I hate to say that. But it seems as though muscle cell,

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:55.000
possibly because of all its use, has adapted

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:58.000
faster than other body tissues to respond to injury,

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:04.000
to fine-tune this repair response and actually be able to finish the process

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:09.000
which the body wants to finish. I really believe that the human body is very,

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:15.000
very smart, and we can't counteract something the body is saying to do.

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:18.000
It's different when a bacteria comes into the body --

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:22.000
that's a foreign object -- we want that out.

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:24.000
But when the body is actually initiating a process

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:28.000
and we're calling it a disease, it doesn't seem as though elimination is

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:36.000
the right solution. So even to go from there, it's possible, although far-fetched,

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:43.000
that in the future we could almost think of cancer being used as a therapy.

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:46.000
If those diseases where tissues are deteriorating --

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:51.000
for example Alzheimer's, where the brain, the brain cells, die

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:55.000
and we need to restore new brain cells, new functional brain cells --

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:59.000
what if we could, in the future, use cancer? A tumor --

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:04.000
put it in the brain and cause it to differentiate into brain cells?

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:10.000
That's a very far-fetched idea, but I really believe that it may be possible.

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:14.000
These cells are so versatile, these cancer cells are so versatile --

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:17.000
we just have to manipulate them in the right way.

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:21.000
And again, some of these may be far-fetched, but

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:26.000
I figured if there's anywhere to present far-fetched ideas, it's here at TED, so

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:28.000
thank you very much.

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:31.000
