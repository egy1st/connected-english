WEBVTT

00:00:00.444 --> 00:00:02.341
We are losing our listening.

00:00:03.499 --> 00:00:07.420
We spend roughly 60 percent
of our communication time listening,

00:00:07.444 --> 00:00:08.976
but we're not very good at it.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.507
We retain just 25 percent of what we hear.

00:00:11.531 --> 00:00:13.033
Now -- not you, not this talk,

00:00:13.057 --> 00:00:14.582
but that is generally true.

00:00:14.606 --> 00:00:15.756
(Laughter)

00:00:16.025 --> 00:00:19.293
Let's define listening
as making meaning from sound.

00:00:19.632 --> 00:00:21.211
It's a mental process,

00:00:21.235 --> 00:00:23.457
and it's a process of extraction.

00:00:23.885 --> 00:00:26.046
We use some pretty cool
techniques to do this.

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:27.809
One of them is pattern recognition.

00:00:27.833 --> 00:00:30.185
(Crowd noises) So in a cocktail
party like this,

00:00:30.209 --> 00:00:34.494
if I say, "David, Sara, pay attention" --
some of you just sat up.

00:00:34.518 --> 00:00:38.187
We recognize patterns
to distinguish noise from signal,

00:00:38.211 --> 00:00:39.726
and especially our name.

00:00:40.251 --> 00:00:42.290
Differencing is another technique we use.

00:00:42.314 --> 00:00:45.470
If I left this pink noise on
for more than a couple of minutes,

00:00:45.494 --> 00:00:48.068
(Pink noise) you would literally
cease to hear it.

00:00:48.092 --> 00:00:52.179
We listen to differences;
we discount sounds that remain the same.

00:00:53.052 --> 00:00:55.841
And then there is a whole
range of filters.

00:00:55.865 --> 00:00:58.317
These filters take us from all sound

00:00:58.341 --> 00:01:00.412
down to what we pay attention to.

00:01:00.436 --> 00:01:04.495
Most people are entirely
unconscious of these filters.

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:07.069
But they actually create
our reality in a way,

00:01:07.093 --> 00:01:10.100
because they tell us what
we're paying attention to right now.

00:01:10.124 --> 00:01:11.890
I'll give you one example of that.

00:01:11.914 --> 00:01:14.821
Intention is very important
in sound, in listening.

00:01:15.234 --> 00:01:16.976
When I married my wife,

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.660
I promised her I would listen
to her every day

00:01:19.684 --> 00:01:21.207
as if for the first time.

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:25.226
Now that's something
I fall short of on a daily basis.

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:26.263
(Laughter)

00:01:26.287 --> 00:01:28.885
But it's a great intention
to have in a relationship.

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:30.594
(Laughter)

00:01:30.618 --> 00:01:31.769
But that's not all.

00:01:31.793 --> 00:01:34.376
Sound places us in space and in time.

00:01:34.769 --> 00:01:37.698
If you close your eyes
right now in this room,

00:01:37.722 --> 00:01:39.729
you're aware of the size of the room

00:01:39.753 --> 00:01:43.571
from the reverberation and the bouncing
of the sound off the surfaces;

00:01:43.595 --> 00:01:45.862
you're aware of how many
people are around you,

00:01:45.886 --> 00:01:48.481
because of the micro-noises
you're receiving.

00:01:48.505 --> 00:01:51.088
And sound places us in time as well,

00:01:51.112 --> 00:01:54.572
because sound always has
time embedded in it.

00:01:54.596 --> 00:01:57.518
In fact, I would suggest
that our listening is the main way

00:01:57.542 --> 00:01:59.688
that we experience the flow of time

00:01:59.712 --> 00:02:01.099
from past to future.

00:02:01.809 --> 00:02:04.735
So, "Sonority is time
and meaning" -- a great quote.

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:07.200
I said at the beginning,
we're losing our listening.

00:02:07.224 --> 00:02:08.634
Why did I say that?

00:02:08.658 --> 00:02:10.692
Well, there are a lot of reasons for this.

00:02:10.716 --> 00:02:12.921
First of all, we invented
ways of recording --

00:02:12.945 --> 00:02:16.687
first writing, then audio recording
and now video recording as well.

00:02:16.711 --> 00:02:20.976
The premium on accurate and careful
listening has simply disappeared.

00:02:21.415 --> 00:02:23.976
Secondly, the world is now so noisy,

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.976
(Noise) with this cacophony
going on visually and auditorily,

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.976
it's just hard to listen;

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.142
it's tiring to listen.

00:02:33.166 --> 00:02:35.615
Many people take refuge in headphones,

00:02:35.639 --> 00:02:38.692
but they turn big,
public spaces like this,

00:02:38.716 --> 00:02:40.112
shared soundscapes,

00:02:40.136 --> 00:02:44.208
into millions of tiny,
little personal sound bubbles.

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:47.260
In this scenario,
nobody's listening to anybody.

00:02:47.887 --> 00:02:49.442
We're becoming impatient.

00:02:49.958 --> 00:02:52.976
We don't want oratory anymore;
we want sound bites.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.445
And the art of conversation is being
replaced -- dangerously, I think --

00:02:57.469 --> 00:02:59.456
by personal broadcasting.

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:02.947
I don't know how much listening
there is in this conversation,

00:03:02.971 --> 00:03:05.760
which is sadly very common,
especially in the UK.

00:03:06.455 --> 00:03:08.126
We're becoming desensitized.

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:11.605
Our media have to scream at us
with these kinds of headlines

00:03:11.629 --> 00:03:13.215
in order to get our attention.

00:03:13.621 --> 00:03:16.052
And that means it's harder
for us to pay attention

00:03:16.076 --> 00:03:18.882
to the quiet, the subtle, the understated.

00:03:20.327 --> 00:03:23.248
This is a serious problem
that we're losing our listening.

00:03:23.272 --> 00:03:24.644
This is not trivial,

00:03:25.263 --> 00:03:28.942
because listening is our access
to understanding.

00:03:28.966 --> 00:03:32.427
Conscious listening
always creates understanding,

00:03:32.451 --> 00:03:34.650
and only without conscious listening

00:03:35.105 --> 00:03:36.626
can these things happen.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.962
A world where we don't listen
to each other at all

00:03:39.986 --> 00:03:42.777
is a very scary place indeed.

00:03:43.754 --> 00:03:47.076
So I'd like to share with you
five simple exercises,

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:48.790
tools you can take away with you,

00:03:48.814 --> 00:03:51.006
to improve your own conscious listening.

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:52.186
Would you like that?

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:53.376
Audience: Yes!

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:55.689
Good. The first one is silence.

00:03:56.352 --> 00:03:59.976
Just three minutes a day of silence
is a wonderful exercise

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.712
to reset your ears and to recalibrate,

00:04:02.736 --> 00:04:04.839
so that you can hear the quiet again.

00:04:04.863 --> 00:04:06.538
If you can't get absolute silence,

00:04:06.562 --> 00:04:08.942
go for quiet, that's absolutely fine.

00:04:09.563 --> 00:04:11.832
Second, I call this "the mixer."

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:15.749
(Noise) So even if you're
in a noisy environment like this --

00:04:15.773 --> 00:04:18.498
and we all spend a lot of time
in places like this --

00:04:18.522 --> 00:04:22.594
listen in the coffee bar
to how many channels of sound can I hear?

00:04:22.618 --> 00:04:25.576
How many individual channels
in that mix am I listening to?

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:28.814
You can do it in a beautiful place
as well, like in a lake.

00:04:28.838 --> 00:04:30.325
How many birds am I hearing?

00:04:30.349 --> 00:04:32.555
Where are they? Where are those ripples?

00:04:32.579 --> 00:04:36.307
It's a great exercise for improving
the quality of your listening.

00:04:37.196 --> 00:04:40.976
Third, this exercise I call "savoring,"
and this is a beautiful exercise.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:42.976
It's about enjoying mundane sounds.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.229
This, for example, is my tumble dryer.

00:04:46.253 --> 00:04:47.351
(Dryer)

00:04:47.375 --> 00:04:51.857
It's a waltz -- one, two, three;
one, two, three; one, two, three.

00:04:51.881 --> 00:04:53.103
I love it!

00:04:53.127 --> 00:04:55.299
Or just try this one on for size.

00:04:55.323 --> 00:05:02.272
(Coffee grinder)

00:05:04.453 --> 00:05:05.612
Wow!

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.379
So, mundane sounds
can be really interesting --

00:05:08.403 --> 00:05:09.596
if you pay attention.

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:12.822
I call that the "hidden choir" --
it's around us all the time.

00:05:13.134 --> 00:05:16.957
The next exercise is probably
the most important of all of these,

00:05:16.981 --> 00:05:18.652
if you just take one thing away.

00:05:18.676 --> 00:05:20.297
This is listening positions --

00:05:20.321 --> 00:05:23.243
the idea that you can move
your listening position

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:26.615
to what's appropriate
to what you're listening to.

00:05:26.639 --> 00:05:28.385
This is playing with those filters.

00:05:28.409 --> 00:05:30.063
Remember I gave you those filters?

00:05:30.087 --> 00:05:32.114
It's starting to play with them as levers,

00:05:32.138 --> 00:05:35.015
to get conscious about them
and to move to different places.

00:05:35.039 --> 00:05:37.278
These are just some
of the listening positions,

00:05:37.302 --> 00:05:39.709
or scales of listening
positions, that you can use.

00:05:39.733 --> 00:05:40.899
There are many.

00:05:40.923 --> 00:05:43.032
Have fun with that. It's very exciting.

00:05:43.425 --> 00:05:45.527
And finally, an acronym.

00:05:45.551 --> 00:05:48.446
You can use this in listening,
in communication.

00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:50.686
If you're in any one of those roles --

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:54.481
and I think that probably is everybody
who's listening to this talk --

00:05:54.505 --> 00:05:56.188
the acronym is RASA,

00:05:56.212 --> 00:05:59.806
which is the Sanskrit word
for "juice" or "essence."

00:06:00.243 --> 00:06:05.052
And RASA stands for "Receive,"
which means pay attention to the person;

00:06:05.076 --> 00:06:08.478
"Appreciate," making little noises
like "hmm," "oh," "OK";

00:06:08.502 --> 00:06:11.889
"Summarize" -- the word "so"
is very important in communication;

00:06:11.913 --> 00:06:14.358
and "Ask," ask questions afterwards.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.292
Now sound is my passion, it's my life.

00:06:17.316 --> 00:06:19.850
I wrote a whole book about it.
So I live to listen.

00:06:19.874 --> 00:06:22.201
That's too much to ask for most people.

00:06:22.754 --> 00:06:26.701
But I believe that every human being
needs to listen consciously

00:06:26.725 --> 00:06:28.462
in order to live fully --

00:06:28.855 --> 00:06:32.545
connected in space and in time
to the physical world around us,

00:06:32.569 --> 00:06:35.095
connected in understanding to each other,

00:06:35.119 --> 00:06:36.941
not to mention spiritually connected,

00:06:36.965 --> 00:06:40.777
because every spiritual path
I know of has listening and contemplation

00:06:40.801 --> 00:06:41.974
at its heart.

00:06:42.650 --> 00:06:47.976
That's why we need to teach listening
in our schools as a skill.

00:06:48.517 --> 00:06:50.327
Why is it not taught? It's crazy.

00:06:50.914 --> 00:06:53.373
And if we can teach listening
in our schools,

00:06:53.397 --> 00:06:56.135
we can take our listening
off that slippery slope

00:06:56.159 --> 00:06:58.705
to that dangerous, scary world
that I talked about,

00:06:58.729 --> 00:07:02.457
and move it to a place where everybody
is consciously listening all the time,

00:07:02.481 --> 00:07:04.261
or at least capable of doing it.

00:07:04.285 --> 00:07:06.166
Now, I don't know how to do that,

00:07:06.190 --> 00:07:07.473
but this is TED,

00:07:08.187 --> 00:07:11.257
and I think the TED community
is capable of anything.

00:07:11.281 --> 00:07:14.541
So I invite you to connect with me,
connect with each other,

00:07:14.565 --> 00:07:15.770
take this mission out.

00:07:15.794 --> 00:07:17.847
And let's get listening taught in schools,

00:07:17.871 --> 00:07:19.869
and transform the world in one generation

00:07:19.893 --> 00:07:22.615
to a conscious, listening world --
a world of connection,

00:07:22.639 --> 00:07:23.976
a world of understanding

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:25.252
and a world of peace.

00:07:25.650 --> 00:07:27.405
Thank you for listening to me today.

00:07:27.429 --> 00:07:29.753
(Applause)
