00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Do you know

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
that we have 1.4 million cellular radio masts

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
deployed worldwide?

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
And these are base stations.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
And we also have

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
more than five billion

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
of these devices here.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
These are cellular mobile phones.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
And with these mobile phones,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
we transmit more than 600 terabytes of data

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
every month.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
This is a 6 with 14 zeroes --

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
a very large number.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
And wireless communications

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
has become a utility

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
like electricity and water.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
We use it everyday. We use it in our everyday lives now --

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
in our private lives, in our business lives.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
And we even have to be asked sometimes, very kindly,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
to switch off the mobile phone at events like this

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
for good reasons.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
And it's this importance

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
why I decided to look into the issues

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
that this technology has,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
because it's so fundamental to our lives.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
And one of the issues is capacity.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
The way we transmit wireless data is by using electromagnetic waves --

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
in particular, radio waves.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
And radio waves are limited.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
They are scarce; they are expensive;

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
and we only have a certain range of it.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
And it's this limitation

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
that doesn't cope

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
with the demand of wireless data transmissions

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
and the number of bytes and data which are transmitted every month.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
And we are simply running out of spectrum.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
There's another problem.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
That is efficiency.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
These 1.4 million cellular radio masts, or base stations,

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
consume a lot of energy.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
And mind you, most of the energy

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
is not used to transmit the radio waves,

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
it is used to cool the base stations.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
Then the efficiency of such a base station

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
is only at about five percent.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
And that creates a big problem.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
Then there's another issue that you're all aware of.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
You have to switch off your mobile phone

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
during flights.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
In hospitals, they are security issues.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
And security is another issue.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
These radio waves penetrate through walls.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
They can be intercepted,

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
and somebody can make use of your network

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
if he has bad intentions.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
So these are the main four issues.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
But on the other hand,

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
we have 14 billion of these:

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
light bulbs, light.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
And light is part of the electromagnetic spectrum.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
So let's look at this in the context

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
of the entire electromagnetic spectrum, where we have gamma rays.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
You don't want to get close to gamma rays, it could be dangerous.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000
X-rays, useful when you go to hospitals.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
Then there's ultraviolet light.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
it's good for a nice suntan,

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000
but otherwise dangerous for the human body.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
Infrared --

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
due to eye safety regulations,

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
can be only used with low power.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000
And then we have the radio waves, they have the issues I've just mentioned.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000
And in the middle there, we have this visible light spectrum.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
It's light,

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
and light has been around for many millions of years.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000
And in fact, it has created us,

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
has created life,

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000
has created all the stuff of life.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000
So it's inherently safe to use.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.000
And wouldn't it be great to use that for wireless communications?

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000
Not only that, I compared [it to] the entire spectrum.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
I compared the radio waves spectrum --

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
the size of it --

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
with the size of the visible light spectrum.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
And guess what?

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000
We have 10,000 times more of that spectrum,

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000
which is there for us to use.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
So not only do we have this huge amount of spectrum,

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
let's compare that with a number I've just mentioned.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000
We have 1.4 million

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000
expensively deployed,

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000
inefficient radio cellular base stations.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000
And multiply that by 10,000,

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000
then you end up at 14 billion.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.000
14 billion is the number of light bulbs installed already.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000
So we have the infrastructure there.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.000
Look at the ceiling, you see all these light bulbs.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000
Go to the main floor, you see these light bulbs.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000
Can we use them for communications?

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000
Yes.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
What do we need to do?

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
The one thing we need to do

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.000
is we have to replace these inefficient incandescent light bulbs,

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.000
florescent lights,

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000
with this new technology of LED,

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000
LED light bulbs.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000
An LED is a semiconductor. It's an electronic device.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:17.000
And it has a very nice acute property.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.000
Its intensity can be modulated

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000
at very high speeds,

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.000
and it can be switched off at very high speeds.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000
And this is a fundamental basic property

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000
that we exploit

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.000
with our technology.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000
So let's show how we do that.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000
Let's go to the closest neighbor to the visible light spectrum --

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000
go to remote controls.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000
You all know remote controls have an infrared LED --

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.000
basically you switch on the LED, and if it's off, you switch it off.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.000
And it creates a simple, low-speed data stream

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000
in 10,000 bits per second,

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000
20,000 bits per second.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
Not usable for a YouTube video.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000
What we have done

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000
is we have developed a technology

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000
with which we can furthermore

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000
replace the remote control of our light bulb.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000
We transmit with our technology,

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000
not only a single data stream,

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000
we transmit thousands of data streams

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000
in parallel,

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000
at even higher speeds.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000
And the technology we have developed --

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000
it's called SIM OFDM.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000
And it's spacial modulation --

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.000
these are the only technical terms, I'm not going into details --

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000
but this is how we enabled

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000
that light source

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.000
to transmit data.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.000
You will say, "Okay, this is nice --

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.000
a slide created in 10 minutes."

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.000
But not only that.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000
What we've done

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.000
is we have also developed a demonstrator.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000
And I'm showing for the first time in public

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.000
this visible light demonstrator.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000
And what we have here

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.000
is no ordinary desk lamp.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000
We fit in an LED light bulb,

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.000
worth three U.S. dollars,

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000
put in our signal processing technology.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.000
And then what we have here is a little hole.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000
And the light goes through that hole.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.000
There's a receiver.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.000
The receiver will convert these little, subtle changes in the amplitude

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000
that we create there

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000
into an electrical signal.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000
And that signal is then converted back

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000
to a high-speed data stream.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.000
In the future we hope

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.000
that we can integrate this little hole

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.000
into these smart phones.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.000
And not only integrate a photo detector here,

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.000
but maybe use the camera inside.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000
So what happens

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.000
when I switch on that light?

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.000
As you would expect,

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000
it's a light, a desk lamp.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.000
Put your book beneath it and you can read.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000
It's illuminating the space.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:48.000
But at the same time, you see this video coming up here.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.000
And that's a video, a high-definition video

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000
that is transmitted through that light beam.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000
You're critical.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.000
You think, "Ha, ha, ha.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.000
This is a smart academic doing a little bit of tricks here."

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.000
But let me do this.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:09.000
(Applause)

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.000
Once again.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.000
Still don't believe?

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.000
It is this light

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.000
that transmits this high-definition video in a split stream.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.000
And if you look at the light,

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.000
it is illuminating as you would expect.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.000
You don't notice with your human eye.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:31.000
You don't notice the subtle changes in the amplitude

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:34.000
that we impress onto this light bulb.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000
It's serving the purpose of illumination,

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.000
but at the same time, we are able to transmit this data.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.000
And you see,

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:44.000
even light from the ceiling comes down here to the receiver.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:47.000
It can ignore that constant light,

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.000
because all the receiver's interested in

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:52.000
are subtle changes.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.000
You also have a critical question now, and

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.000
you say, "Okay,

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000
do I have to have the light on all the time

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000
to have this working?"

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000
And the answer is yes.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:08.000
But, you can dim down the light

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.000
to a level that it appears to be off.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:13.000
And you are still able to transmit data -- that's possible.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:16.000
So I've mentioned to you the four challenges.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.000
Capacity:

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.000
We have 10,000 times more spectrum,

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.000
10,000 times more LEDs

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.000
installed already in the infrastructure there.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000
You would agree with me, hopefully,

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000
there's no issue of capacity anymore.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.000
Efficiency:

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000
This is data through illumination --

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.000
it's first of all an illumination device.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:37.000
And if you do the energy budget,

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.000
the data transmission comes for free --

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.000
highly energy efficient.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.000
I don't mention the high energy efficiency

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.000
of these LED light bulbs.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.000
If the whole world would deploy them,

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:50.000
you would save hundreds of power plants.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.000
That's aside.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.000
And then I've mentioned the availability.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:57.000
You will agree with me that we have lights in the hospital.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.000
You need to see what to do.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.000
You have lights in an aircraft.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.000
So it's everywhere in a day there is light.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:06.000
Look around. Everywhere. Look at your smart phone.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.000
It has a flashlight, an LED flashlight.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:12.000
These are potential sources for high-speed data transmission.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.000
And then there's security.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.000
You would agree with me

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:20.000
that light doesn't penetrate through walls.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.000
So no one, if I have a light here,

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.000
if I have secure data,

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.000
no one on the other side of this room through that wall

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.000
would be able to read that data.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:31.000
And there's only data where there is light.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:35.000
So if I don't want that receiver to receive the data,

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:39.000
then what I could do,

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:42.000
turn it away.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:44.000
So the data goes in that direction, not there anymore.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:47.000
Now we can in fact see where the data is going to.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:53.000
So for me,

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:56.000
the applications of it,

00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:00.000
to me, are beyond imagination at the moment.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:04.000
We have had a century of very nice, smart application developers.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:07.000
And you only have to notice, where we have light,

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:10.000
there is a potential way to transmit data.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:13.000
But I can give you a few examples.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:16.000
Well you may see the impact already now.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.000
This is a remote operated vehicle

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.000
beneath the ocean.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:24.000
And they use light to illuminate space down there.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.000
And this light can be used to transmit wireless data

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:29.000
that these things [use] to communicate with each other.

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.000
Intrinsically safe environments

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:33.000
like this petrochemical plant --

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:36.000
you can't use RF, it may generate antenna sparks,

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:39.000
but you can use light -- you see plenty of light there.

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.000
In hospitals,

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:44.000
for new medical instruments;

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:47.000
in streets for traffic control.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:50.000
Cars have LED-based headlights, LED-based back lights,

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.000
and cars can communicate with each other

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:55.000
and prevent accidents

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:58.000
in the way that they exchange information.

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:01.000
Traffic lights can communicate to the car and so on.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:04.000
And then you have these millions of street lamps

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:07.000
deployed around the world.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.000
And every street lamp could be a free access point.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.000
We call it, in fact, a Li-Fi,

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.000
light-fidelity.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:17.000
And then we have these aircraft cabins.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:21.000
There are hundreds of lights in an aircraft cabin,

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.000
and each of these lights

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:26.000
could be a potential transmitter of wireless data.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:29.000
So you could enjoy your most favorite TED video

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.000
on your long flight back home.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:34.000
Online life. So that is a vision, I think, that is possible.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:42.000
So, all we would need to do

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:44.000
is to fit a small microchip

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:47.000
to every potential illumination device.

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:50.000
And this would then combine

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.000
two basic functionalities:

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.000
illumination and wireless data transmission.

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:57.000
And it's this symbiosis that I personally believe

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.000
could solve the four essential problems

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:02.000
that face us in wireless communication these days.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.000
And in the future,

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:07.000
you would not only have 14 billion light bulbs,

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:10.000
you may have 14 billion Li-Fis

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.000
deployed worldwide --

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.000
for a cleaner, a greener,

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.000
and even a brighter future.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.000
Thank you.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:30.000
(Applause)
