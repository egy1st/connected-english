00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Each of you possesses

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
the most powerful, dangerous and subversive trait

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
that natural selection has ever devised.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
It's a piece of neural audio technology

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
for rewiring other people's minds.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
I'm talking about your language, of course,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
because it allows you to implant a thought from your mind

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
directly into someone else's mind,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
and they can attempt to do the same to you,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
without either of you having to perform surgery.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Instead, when you speak,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
you're actually using a form of telemetry

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
not so different

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
from the remote control device for your television.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
It's just that, whereas that device

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
relies on pulses of infrared light,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
your language relies on pulses,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
discrete pulses, of sound.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
And just as you use the remote control device

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
to alter the internal settings of your television

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
to suit your mood,

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
you use your language

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
to alter the settings inside someone else's brain

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
to suit your interests.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
Languages are genes talking,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
getting things that they want.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
And just imagine the sense of wonder in a baby

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
when it first discovers that, merely by uttering a sound,

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
it can get objects to move across a room

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
as if by magic,

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
and maybe even into its mouth.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
Now language's subversive power

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
has been recognized throughout the ages

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
in censorship, in books you can't read,

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
phrases you can't use

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
and words you can't say.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
In fact, the Tower of Babel story in the Bible

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
is a fable and warning

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
about the power of language.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
According to that story, early humans developed the conceit

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
that, by using their language to work together,

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
they could build a tower

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
that would take them all the way to heaven.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
Now God, angered at this attempt to usurp his power,

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
destroyed the tower,

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
and then to ensure

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
that it would never be rebuilt,

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
he scattered the people by giving them different languages --

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
confused them by giving them different languages.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
And this leads to the wonderful irony

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
that our languages exist to prevent us from communicating.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
Even today,

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
we know that there are words we cannot use,

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
phrases we cannot say,

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
because if we do so,

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
we might be accosted, jailed,

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
or even killed.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
And all of this from a puff of air

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
emanating from our mouths.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
Now all this fuss about a single one of our traits

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
tells us there's something worth explaining.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
And that is how and why

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
did this remarkable trait evolve,

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
and why did it evolve

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
only in our species?

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
Now it's a little bit of a surprise

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
that to get an answer to that question,

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
we have to go to tool use

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
in the chimpanzees.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
Now these chimpanzees are using tools,

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000
and we take that as a sign of their intelligence.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
But if they really were intelligent,

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000
why would they use a stick to extract termites from the ground

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
rather than a shovel?

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
And if they really were intelligent,

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
why would they crack open nuts with a rock?

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000
Why wouldn't they just go to a shop and buy a bag of nuts

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000
that somebody else had already cracked open for them?

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
Why not? I mean, that's what we do.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
Now the reason the chimpanzees don't do that

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
is that they lack what psychologists and anthropologists call

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
social learning.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000
They seem to lack the ability

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
to learn from others

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
by copying or imitating

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
or simply watching.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
As a result,

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000
they can't improve on others' ideas

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000
or learn from others' mistakes --

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
benefit from others' wisdom.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000
And so they just do the same thing

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
over and over and over again.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.000
In fact, we could go away for a million years and come back

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000
and these chimpanzees would be doing the same thing

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000
with the same sticks for the termites

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.000
and the same rocks to crack open the nuts.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.000
Now this may sound arrogant, or even full of hubris.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000
How do we know this?

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.000
Because this is exactly what our ancestors, the Homo erectus, did.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000
These upright apes

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000
evolved on the African savanna

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000
about two million years ago,

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
and they made these splendid hand axes

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
that fit wonderfully into your hands.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000
But if we look at the fossil record,

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000
we see that they made the same hand axe

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000
over and over and over again

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000
for one million years.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000
You can follow it through the fossil record.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000
Now if we make some guesses about how long Homo erectus lived,

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000
what their generation time was,

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.000
that's about 40,000 generations

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.000
of parents to offspring, and other individuals watching,

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000
in which that hand axe didn't change.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000
It's not even clear

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
that our very close genetic relatives, the Neanderthals,

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
had social learning.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000
Sure enough, their tools were more complicated

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000
than those of Homo erectus,

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000
but they too showed very little change

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.000
over the 300,000 years or so

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000
that those species, the Neanderthals,

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000
lived in Eurasia.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000
Okay, so what this tells us

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.000
is that, contrary to the old adage,

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.000
"monkey see, monkey do,"

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000
the surprise really is

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000
that all of the other animals

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.000
really cannot do that -- at least not very much.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000
And even this picture

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.000
has the suspicious taint of being rigged about it --

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000
something from a Barnum &amp; Bailey circus.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000
But by comparison,

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000
we can learn.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.000
We can learn by watching other people

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000
and copying or imitating

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000
what they can do.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.000
We can then choose, from among a range of options,

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000
the best one.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000
We can benefit from others' ideas.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000
We can build on their wisdom.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.000
And as a result, our ideas do accumulate,

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:33.000
and our technology progresses.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:38.000
And this cumulative cultural adaptation,

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000
as anthropologists call

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000
this accumulation of ideas,

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.000
is responsible for everything around you

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000
in your bustling and teeming everyday lives.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.000
I mean the world has changed out of all proportion

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000
to what we would recognize

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.000
even 1,000 or 2,000 years ago.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.000
And all of this because of cumulative cultural adaptation.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000
The chairs you're sitting in, the lights in this auditorium,

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.000
my microphone, the iPads and iPods that you carry around with you --

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.000
all are a result

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000
of cumulative cultural adaptation.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:09.000
Now to many commentators,

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.000
cumulative cultural adaptation, or social learning,

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.000
is job done, end of story.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.000
Our species can make stuff,

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.000
therefore we prospered in a way that no other species has.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.000
In fact, we can even make the "stuff of life" --

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000
as I just said, all the stuff around us.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000
But in fact, it turns out

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.000
that some time around 200,000 years ago,

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.000
when our species first arose

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.000
and acquired social learning,

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.000
that this was really the beginning of our story,

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000
not the end of our story.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.000
Because our acquisition of social learning

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.000
would create a social and evolutionary dilemma,

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.000
the resolution of which, it's fair to say,

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:52.000
would determine not only the future course of our psychology,

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000
but the future course of the entire world.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.000
And most importantly for this,

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.000
it'll tell us why we have language.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000
And the reason that dilemma arose

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.000
is, it turns out, that social learning is visual theft.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:08.000
If I can learn by watching you,

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.000
I can steal your best ideas,

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.000
and I can benefit from your efforts,

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000
without having to put in the time and energy that you did

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.000
into developing them.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.000
If I can watch which lure you use to catch a fish,

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.000
or I can watch how you flake your hand axe

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.000
to make it better,

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.000
or if I follow you secretly to your mushroom patch,

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.000
I can benefit from your knowledge and wisdom and skills,

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000
and maybe even catch that fish

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.000
before you do.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:37.000
Social learning really is visual theft.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.000
And in any species that acquired it,

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.000
it would behoove you

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.000
to hide your best ideas,

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:46.000
lest somebody steal them from you.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:50.000
And so some time around 200,000 years ago,

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:53.000
our species confronted this crisis.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:56.000
And we really had only two options

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.000
for dealing with the conflicts

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000
that visual theft would bring.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000
One of those options

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:05.000
was that we could have retreated

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.000
into small family groups.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:10.000
Because then the benefits of our ideas and knowledge

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000
would flow just to our relatives.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.000
Had we chosen this option,

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:17.000
sometime around 200,000 years ago,

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:20.000
we would probably still be living like the Neanderthals were

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:23.000
when we first entered Europe 40,000 years ago.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.000
And this is because in small groups

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:28.000
there are fewer ideas, there are fewer innovations.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.000
And small groups are more prone to accidents and bad luck.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.000
So if we'd chosen that path,

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.000
our evolutionary path would have led into the forest --

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.000
and been a short one indeed.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.000
The other option we could choose

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:43.000
was to develop the systems of communication

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.000
that would allow us to share ideas

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:48.000
and to cooperate amongst others.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000
Choosing this option would mean

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:53.000
that a vastly greater fund of accumulated knowledge and wisdom

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:56.000
would become available to any one individual

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:59.000
than would ever arise from within an individual family

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:02.000
or an individual person on their own.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:06.000
Well, we chose the second option,

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:09.000
and language is the result.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.000
Language evolved to solve the crisis

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.000
of visual theft.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:16.000
Language is a piece of social technology

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:19.000
for enhancing the benefits of cooperation --

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:22.000
for reaching agreements, for striking deals

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:26.000
and for coordinating our activities.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.000
And you can see that, in a developing society

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.000
that was beginning to acquire language,

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.000
not having language

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.000
would be a like a bird without wings.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:37.000
Just as wings open up this sphere of air

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.000
for birds to exploit,

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.000
language opened up the sphere of cooperation

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.000
for humans to exploit.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.000
And we take this utterly for granted,

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:48.000
because we're a species that is so at home with language,

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.000
but you have to realize

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:53.000
that even the simplest acts of exchange that we engage in

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:56.000
are utterly dependent upon language.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.000
And to see why, consider two scenarios

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.000
from early in our evolution.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.000
Let's imagine that you are really good

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.000
at making arrowheads,

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:07.000
but you're hopeless at making the wooden shafts

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:10.000
with the flight feathers attached.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:13.000
Two other people you know are very good at making the wooden shafts,

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:16.000
but they're hopeless at making the arrowheads.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.000
So what you do is --

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:21.000
one of those people has not really acquired language yet.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.000
And let's pretend the other one is good at language skills.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:26.000
So what you do one day is you take a pile of arrowheads,

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.000
and you walk up to the one that can't speak very well,

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.000
and you put the arrowheads down in front of him,

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:33.000
hoping that he'll get the idea that you want to trade your arrowheads

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.000
for finished arrows.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.000
But he looks at the pile of arrowheads, thinks they're a gift,

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:40.000
picks them up, smiles and walks off.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.000
Now you pursue this guy, gesticulating.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.000
A scuffle ensues and you get stabbed

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:47.000
with one of your own arrowheads.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:50.000
Okay, now replay this scene now, and you're approaching the one who has language.

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.000
You put down your arrowheads and say,

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:55.000
"I'd like to trade these arrowheads for finished arrows. I'll split you 50/50."

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.000
The other one says, "Fine. Looks good to me.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:00.000
We'll do that."

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:03.000
Now the job is done.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:05.000
Once we have language,

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:07.000
we can put our ideas together and cooperate

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.000
to have a prosperity

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:12.000
that we couldn't have before we acquired it.

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.000
And this is why our species

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.000
has prospered around the world

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.000
while the rest of the animals

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:21.000
sit behind bars in zoos, languishing.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:24.000
That's why we build space shuttles and cathedrals

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.000
while the rest of the world sticks sticks into the ground

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.000
to extract termites.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:31.000
All right, if this view of language

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:33.000
and its value

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:36.000
in solving the crisis of visual theft is true,

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.000
any species that acquires it

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:41.000
should show an explosion of creativity and prosperity.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:44.000
And this is exactly what the archeological record shows.

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:46.000
If you look at our ancestors,

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:49.000
the Neanderthals and the Homo erectus, our immediate ancestors,

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:52.000
they're confined to small regions of the world.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.000
But when our species arose

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.000
about 200,000 years ago,

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:59.000
sometime after that we quickly walked out of Africa

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:02.000
and spread around the entire world,

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:05.000
occupying nearly every habitat on Earth.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:08.000
Now whereas other species are confined

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:11.000
to places that their genes adapt them to,

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.000
with social learning and language,

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:15.000
we could transform the environment

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:17.000
to suit our needs.

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:19.000
And so we prospered in a way

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:21.000
that no other animal has.

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:24.000
Language really is

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:27.000
the most potent trait that has ever evolved.

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:30.000
It is the most valuable trait we have

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:33.000
for converting new lands and resources

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:36.000
into more people and their genes

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.000
that natural selection has ever devised.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.000
Language really is

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:42.000
the voice of our genes.

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:44.000
Now having evolved language, though,

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:46.000
we did something peculiar,

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.000
even bizarre.

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.000
As we spread out around the world,

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:53.000
we developed thousands of different languages.

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.000
Currently, there are about seven or 8,000

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:58.000
different languages spoken on Earth.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.000
Now you might say, well, this is just natural.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:03.000
As we diverge, our languages are naturally going to diverge.

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:05.000
But the real puzzle and irony

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:08.000
is that the greatest density of different languages on Earth

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:12.000
is found where people are most tightly packed together.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.000
If we go to the island of Papua New Guinea,

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:17.000
we can find about 800 to 1,000

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:19.000
distinct human languages,

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:21.000
different human languages,

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.000
spoken on that island alone.

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:25.000
There are places on that island

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:27.000
where you can encounter a new language

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:29.000
every two or three miles.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:31.000
Now, incredible as this sounds,

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:34.000
I once met a Papuan man, and I asked him if this could possibly be true.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:36.000
And he said to me, "Oh no.

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:39.000
They're far closer together than that."

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:41.000
And it's true; there are places on that island

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:44.000
where you can encounter a new language in under a mile.

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:47.000
And this is also true of some remote oceanic islands.

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.000
And so it seems that we use our language,

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.000
not just to cooperate,

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:55.000
but to draw rings around our cooperative groups

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.000
and to establish identities,

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:00.000
and perhaps to protect our knowledge and wisdom and skills

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:03.000
from eavesdropping from outside.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:05.000
And we know this

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:07.000
because when we study different language groups

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:09.000
and associate them with their cultures,

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:11.000
we see that different languages

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:14.000
slow the flow of ideas between groups.

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:17.000
They slow the flow of technologies.

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:20.000
And they even slow the flow of genes.

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:22.000
Now I can't speak for you,

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:24.000
but it seems to be the case

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:27.000
that we don't have sex with people we can't talk to.

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.000
(Laughter)

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.000
Now we have to counter that, though,

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.000
against the evidence we've heard

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:37.000
that we might have had some rather distasteful genetic dalliances

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.000
with the Neanderthals and the Denisovans.

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:41.000
(Laughter)

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:43.000
Okay, this tendency we have,

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:45.000
this seemingly natural tendency we have,

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:48.000
towards isolation, towards keeping to ourselves,

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:51.000
crashes head first into our modern world.

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:53.000
This remarkable image

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:55.000
is not a map of the world.

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:59.000
In fact, it's a map of Facebook friendship links.

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:01.000
And when you plot those friendship links

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.000
by their latitude and longitude,

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:06.000
it literally draws a map of the world.

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:08.000
Our modern world is communicating

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:10.000
with itself and with each other

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:12.000
more than it has

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:14.000
at any time in its past.

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:17.000
And that communication, that connectivity around the world,

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:19.000
that globalization

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:22.000
now raises a burden.

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:24.000
Because these different languages

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:26.000
impose a barrier, as we've just seen,

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:28.000
to the transfer of goods and ideas

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:30.000
and technologies and wisdom.

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:33.000
And they impose a barrier to cooperation.

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:36.000
And nowhere do we see that more clearly

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:38.000
than in the European Union,

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:41.000
whose 27 member countries

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:44.000
speak 23 official languages.

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:46.000
The European Union

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:50.000
is now spending over one billion euros annually

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:53.000
translating among their 23 official languages.

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:55.000
That's something on the order

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:57.000
of 1.45 billion U.S. dollars

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:00.000
on translation costs alone.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:02.000
Now think of the absurdity of this situation.

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:04.000
If 27 individuals

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:06.000
from those 27 member states

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:09.000
sat around table, speaking their 23 languages,

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:11.000
some very simple mathematics will tell you

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:15.000
that you need an army of 253 translators

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:19.000
to anticipate all the pairwise possibilities.

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:22.000
The European Union employs a permanent staff

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:24.000
of about 2,500 translators.

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:26.000
And in 2007 alone --

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:28.000
and I'm sure there are more recent figures --

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:31.000
something on the order of 1.3 million pages

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:34.000
were translated into English alone.

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:37.000
And so if language really is

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:40.000
the solution to the crisis of visual theft,

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:42.000
if language really is

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:44.000
the conduit of our cooperation,

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:47.000
the technology that our species derived

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:51.000
to promote the free flow and exchange of ideas,

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:53.000
in our modern world,

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:55.000
we confront a question.

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:57.000
And that question is whether

00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:59.000
in this modern, globalized world

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:02.000
we can really afford to have all these different languages.

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:05.000
To put it this way, nature knows no other circumstance

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:10.000
in which functionally equivalent traits coexist.

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:13.000
One of them always drives the other extinct.

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:15.000
And we see this in the inexorable march

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:17.000
towards standardization.

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:20.000
There are lots and lots of ways of measuring things --

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:22.000
weighing them and measuring their length --

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:24.000
but the metric system is winning.

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:27.000
There are lots and lots of ways of measuring time,

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:30.000
but a really bizarre base 60 system

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:32.000
known as hours and minutes and seconds

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:35.000
is nearly universal around the world.

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:37.000
There are many, many ways

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:39.000
of imprinting CDs or DVDs,

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:42.000
but those are all being standardized as well.

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:45.000
And you can probably think of many, many more

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:47.000
in your own everyday lives.

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:50.000
And so our modern world now

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:52.000
is confronting us with a dilemma.

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:54.000
And it's the dilemma

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:56.000
that this Chinese man faces,

00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:58.000
who's language is spoken

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:00.000
by more people in the world

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:03.000
than any other single language,

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:07.000
and yet he is sitting at his blackboard,

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:10.000
converting Chinese phrases

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:12.000
into English language phrases.

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:15.000
And what this does is it raises the possibility to us

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:17.000
that in a world in which we want to promote

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:19.000
cooperation and exchange,

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:22.000
and in a world that might be dependent more than ever before

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:24.000
on cooperation

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:27.000
to maintain and enhance our levels of prosperity,

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:29.000
his actions suggest to us

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:31.000
it might be inevitable

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:33.000
that we have to confront the idea

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:36.000
that our destiny is to be one world with one language.

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:38.000
Thank you.

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:46.000
(Applause)

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:48.000
Matt Ridley: Mark, one question.

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:51.000
Svante found that the FOXP2 gene,

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:53.000
which seems to be associated with language,

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:55.000
was also shared in the same form

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:57.000
in Neanderthals as us.

00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:59.000
Do we have any idea

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:01.000
how we could have defeated Neanderthals

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:03.000
if they also had language?

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:05.000
Mark Pagel: This is a very good question.

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:08.000
So many of you will be familiar with the idea that there's this gene called FOXP2

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:11.000
that seems to be implicated in some ways

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:14.000
in the fine motor control that's associated with language.

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:16.000
The reason why I don't believe that tells us

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:18.000
that the Neanderthals had language

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:21.000
is -- here's a simple analogy:

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:24.000
Ferraris are cars that have engines.

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:26.000
My car has an engine,

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:28.000
but it's not a Ferrari.

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:30.000
Now the simple answer then

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:32.000
is that genes alone don't, all by themselves,

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:34.000
determine the outcome

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:36.000
of very complicated things like language.

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:38.000
What we know about this FOXP2 and Neanderthals

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:42.000
is that they may have had fine motor control of their mouths -- who knows.

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:44.000
But that doesn't tell us they necessarily had language.

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:46.000
MR: Thank you very much indeed.

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:49.000
