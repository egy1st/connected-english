00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Humans in the developed world

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
spend more than 90 percent of their lives indoors,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
where they breathe in and come into contact

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
with trillions of life forms invisible to the naked eye:

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
microorganisms.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Buildings are complex ecosystems

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
that are an important source

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
of microbes that are good for us,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
and some that are bad for us.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
What determines the types and distributions

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
of microbes indoors?

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Buildings are colonized by airborne microbes

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
that enter through windows

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
and through mechanical ventilation systems.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
And they are brought inside

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
by humans and other creatures.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
The fate of microbes indoors

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
depends on complex interactions

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
with humans,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
and with the human-built environment.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
And today, architects and biologists

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
are working together

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
to explore smart building design

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
that will create

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
healthy buildings for us.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
We spend an extraordinary amount of time

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
in buildings

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
that are extremely controlled environments,

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
like this building here --

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
environments that have mechanical ventilation systems

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
that include filtering,

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
heating and air conditioning.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
Given the amount of time that we spend indoors,

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
it's important to understand

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
how this affects our health.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
At the Biology and the Built Environment Center,

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
we carried out a study in a hospital

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
where we sampled air

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
and pulled the DNA

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
out of microbes in the air.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
And we looked at three different types of rooms.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
We looked at rooms that were mechanically ventilated,

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
which are the data points in the blue.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
We looked at rooms that were naturally ventilated,

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
where the hospital let us turn off the mechanical ventilation

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
in a wing of the building

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
and pry open the windows

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
that were no longer operable,

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
but they made them operable for our study.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
And we also sampled the outdoor air.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
If you look at the x-axis of this graph,

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
you'll see that what we commonly want to do --

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
which is keeping the outdoors out --

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
we accomplished that with mechanical ventilation.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
So if you look at the green data points,

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
which is air that's outside,

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
you'll see that there's a large amount of microbial diversity,

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
or variety of microbial types.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
But if you look at the blue data points,

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
which is mechanically ventilated air,

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000
it's not as diverse.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
But being less diverse

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
is not necessarily good for our health.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
If you look at the y-axis of this graph,

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
you'll see that, in the mechanically ventilated air,

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
you have a higher probability

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
of encountering a potential pathogen,

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
or germ,

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000
than if you're outdoors.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000
So to understand why this was the case,

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
we took our data

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
and put it into an ordination diagram,

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
which is a statistical map

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
that tells you something

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
about how related the microbial communities are

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
in the different samples.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
The data points that are closer together

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
have microbial communities that are more similar

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
than data points that are far apart.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
And the first things that you can see from this graph

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
is, if you look at the blue data points,

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
which are the mechanically ventilated air,

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000
they're not simply a subset of the green data points,

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
which are the outdoor air.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000
What we've found is that mechanically ventilated air

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
looks like humans.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
It has microbes on it

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000
that are commonly associated with our skin

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
and with our mouth, our spit.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
And this is because

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
we're all constantly shedding microbes.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
So all of you right now

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000
are sharing your microbes with one another.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000
And when you're outdoors,

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000
that type of air has microbes

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.000
that are commonly associated with plant leaves and with dirt.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000
Why does this matter?

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000
It matters because the health care industry

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000
is the second most energy intensive industry

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000
in the United States.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000
Hospitals use two and a half times

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.000
the amount of energy as office buildings.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000
And the model that we're working with

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
in hospitals,

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
and also with many, many different buildings,

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000
is to keep the outdoors out.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000
And this model

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.000
may not necessarily be the best for our health.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000
And given the extraordinary amount

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000
of nosocomial infections,

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000
or hospital-acquired infections,

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000
this is a clue that it's a good time

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.000
to reconsider our current practices.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.000
So just as we manage national parks,

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.000
where we promote the growth of some species

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.000
and we inhibit the growth of others,

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000
we're working towards thinking about buildings

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000
using an ecosystem framework

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000
where we can promote the kinds of microbes

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.000
that we want to have indoors.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000
I've heard somebody say

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000
that you're as healthy as your gut.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.000
And for this reason, many people eat probiotic yogurt

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.000
so they can promote a healthy gut flora.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
And what we ultimately want to do

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.000
is to be able to use this concept

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000
to promote a healthy group

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000
of microorganisms inside.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000
Thank you.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.000
(Applause)
