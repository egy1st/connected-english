00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
So today, I want us to reflect

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
on the demise of guys.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Guys are flaming out academically;

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
they're wiping out socially with girls

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
and sexually with women.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Other than that, there's not much of a problem.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
So what's the data?

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
So the data on dropping out is amazing.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Boys are 30 percent more likely than girls

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
to drop out of school.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
In Canada, five boys drop out for every three girls.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Girls outperform boys now at every level,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
from elementary school to graduate school.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
There's a 10 percent differential

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
between getting BA's and all graduate programs,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
with guys falling behind girls.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Two-thirds of all students in special ed. remedial programs are guys.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
And as you all know,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
boys are five times more likely than girls

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
to be labeled as having attention deficit disorder --

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
and therefore we drug them with Ritalin.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
What's the evidence of wiping out?

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
First, it's a new fear of intimacy.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
Intimacy means physical, emotional connection

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
with somebody else --

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
and especially with somebody of the opposite sex

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
who gives off ambiguous, contradictory,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
phosphorescent signals.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000
(Laughter)

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
And every year there's research done

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
on self-reported shyness among college students.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
And we're seeing a steady increase among males.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
And this is two kinds.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
It's a social awkwardness.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
The old shyness was a fear of rejection.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
It's a social awkwardness like you're a stranger in a foreign land.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
They don't know what to say, they don't know what to do,

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
especially one-on-one [with the] opposite sex.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
They don't know the language of face contact,

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
the non-verbal and verbal set of rules

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
that enable you to comfortably talk to somebody else,

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
listen to somebody else.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
There's something I'm developing here called social intensity syndrome,

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
which tries to account for why guys really prefer

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
male bonding over female mating.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
It turns out, from earliest childhood,

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
boys, and then men,

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
prefer the company of guys --

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
physical company.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000
And there's actually a cortical arousal we're looking at,

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
because guys have been with guys

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
in teams, in clubs, in gangs, in fraternities,

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
especially in the military, and then in pubs.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
And this peaks at Super Bowl Sunday

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
when guys would rather be in a bar with strangers,

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000
watching a totally overdressed Aaron Rodgers of the Green Bay Packers,

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000
rather than Jennifer Lopez totally naked in the bedroom.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
The problem is they now prefer

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
[the] asynchronistic Internet world

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
to the spontaneous interaction

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
in social relationships.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
What are the causes? Well, it's an unintended consequence.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
I think it's excessive Internet use in general, excessive video gaming,

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.000
excessive new access to pornography.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000
The problem is these are arousal addictions.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
Drug addiction, you simply want more.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
Arousal addiction, you want different.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
Drugs, you want more of the same -- different.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000
So you need the novelty in order for the arousal to be sustained.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000
And the problem is the industry is supplying it.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
Jane McGonigal told us last year

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
that by the time a boy is 21,

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
he's played 10,000 hours of video games,

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
most of that in isolation.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
As you remember, Cindy Gallop said

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000
men don't know the difference

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000
between making love and doing porn.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000
The average boy now watches 50 porn video clips a week.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000
And there's some guy watching a hundred, obviously.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
(Laughter)

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000
And the porn industry is the fastest growing industry in America --

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000
15 billion annually.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000
For every 400 movies made in Hollywood,

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.000
there are 11,000 now made porn videos.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
So the effect, very quickly,

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000
is it's a new kind of arousal.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.000
Boys' brains are being digitally rewired in a totally new way

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000
for change, novelty, excitement and constant arousal.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000
That means they're totally out of sync in traditional classes,

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000
which are analog, static, interactively passive.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000
They're also totally out of sync

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000
in romantic relationships,

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000
which build gradually and subtly.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000
So what's the solution? It's not my job.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000
I'm here to alarm. It's your job to solve.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.000
(Laughter)

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000
(Applause)

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.000
But who should care? The only people who should care about this

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000
is parents of boys and girls,

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
educators, gamers, filmmakers

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000
and women who would like a real man

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000
who they can talk to, who can dance,

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000
who can make love slowly

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000
and contribute to the evolutionary pressures

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.000
to keep our species above banana slugs.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000
No offense to banana slug owners. Thank you.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:25.000
(Applause)
