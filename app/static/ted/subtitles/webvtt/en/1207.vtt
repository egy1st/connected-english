00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Climate change is already a heavy topic,

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
and it's getting heavier

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
because we're understanding

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
that we need to do more than we are.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
We're understanding, in fact,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
that those of us who live in the developed world

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
need to be really pushing towards eliminating our emissions.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
That's, to put it mildly, not what's on the table now.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
And it tends to feel a little overwhelming

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
when we look at what is there in reality today

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
and the magnitude of the problem that we face.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
And when we have overwhelming problems in front of us,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
we tend to seek simple answers.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
And I think this is what we've done with climate change.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
We look at where the emissions are coming from --

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
they're coming out of our tailpipes and smokestacks and so forth,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
and we say, okay, well the problem is

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
that they're coming out of fossil fuels that we're burning,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
so therefore, the answer must be

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
to replace those fossil fuels with clean sources of energy.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
And while, of course, we do need clean energy,

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
I would put to you that it's possible

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
that by looking at climate change

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
as a clean energy generation problem,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
we're in fact setting ourselves up

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
not to solve it.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
And the reason why

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
is that we live on a planet

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
that is rapidly urbanizing.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
That shouldn't be news to any of us.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
However, it's hard sometimes

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
to remember the extent of that urbanization.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
By mid-century,

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
we're going to have about eight billion -- perhaps more -- people

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
living in cities or within a day's travel of one.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
We will be an overwhelmingly urban species.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
In order to provide

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
the kind of energy that it would take

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
for eight billion people living in cities

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
that are even somewhat like the cities

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
that those of us in the global North live in today,

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
we would have to generate

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
an absolutely astonishing amount of energy.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
It may be possible

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
that we are not even able

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
to build that much clean energy.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
So if we're seriously talking about tackling climate change

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
on an urbanizing planet,

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
we need to look somewhere else for the solution.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000
The solution, in fact, may be closer to hand than we think,

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
because all of those cities we're building

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
are opportunities.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
Every city determines to a very large extent

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
the amount of energy used by its inhabitants.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
We tend to think of energy use as a behavioral thing --

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
I choose to turn this light switch on --

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000
but really, enormous amounts of our energy use

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
are predestined

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000
by the kinds of communities and cities that we live in.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
I won't show you very many graphs today,

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
but if I can just focus on this one for a moment,

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
it really tells us a lot of what we need to know --

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
which is, quite simply,

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
that if you look, for example, at transportation,

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
a major category of climate emissions,

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
there is a direct relationship

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
between how dense a city is

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
and the amount of climate emissions

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000
that its residents spew out into the air.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
And the correlation, of course,

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000
is that denser places tend to have lower emissions --

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000
which isn't really all that difficult to figure out, if you think about it.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
Basically,

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
we substitute, in our lives,

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
access to the things we want.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
We go out there and we hop in our cars

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000
and we drive from place to place.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000
And we're basically using mobility to get the access we need.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
But when we live in a denser community,

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
suddenly what we find, of course,

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000
is that the things we need are close by.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
And since the most sustainable trip

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000
is the one that you never had to make in the first place,

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000
suddenly our lives become instantly more sustainable.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000
And it is possible, of course,

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.000
to increase the density of the communities around us.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
Some places are doing this with new eco districts,

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000
developing whole new sustainable neighborhoods,

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
which is nice work if you can get it,

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.000
but most of the time, what we're talking about is, in fact,

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000
reweaving the urban fabric that we already have.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000
So we're talking about things like infill development:

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000
really sharp little changes

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000
to where we have buildings, where we're developing.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000
Urban retrofitting:

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000
creating different sorts of spaces and uses

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000
out of places that are already there.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000
Increasingly, we're realizing

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000
that we don't even need to densify an entire city.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
What we need instead is an average density

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
that rises to a level

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
where we don't drive as much and so on.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000
And that can be done

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000
by raising the density in very specific spots a whole lot.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000
So you can think of it as tent poles

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000
that actually raise the density of the entire city.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000
And we find that when we do that,

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000
we can, in fact, have a few places that are really hyper-dense

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000
within a wider fabric of places

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000
that are perhaps a little more comfortable

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000
and achieve the same results.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.000
Now we may find that there are places that are really, really dense

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000
and still hold onto their cars,

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000
but the reality is that, by and large,

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000
what we see when we get a lot of people together with the right conditions

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000
is a threshold effect,

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000
where people simply stop driving as much,

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000
and increasingly, more and more people,

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000
if they're surrounded by places that make them feel at home,

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000
give up their cars altogether.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.000
And this is a huge, huge energy savings,

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000
because what comes out of our tailpipe

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000
is really just the beginning of the story

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
with climate emissions from cars.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000
We have the manufacture of the car, the disposal of the car,

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000
all of the parking and freeways and so on.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000
When you can get rid of all of those

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000
because somebody doesn't use any of them really,

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000
you find that you can actually cut transportation emissions

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000
as much as 90 percent.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000
And people are embracing this.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.000
All around the world, we're seeing more and more people embrace this walkshed life.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.000
People are saying that it's moving from the idea of the dream home

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000
to the dream neighborhood.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000
And when you layer that over

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.000
with the kind of ubiquitous communications that we're starting to see,

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000
what you find is, in fact,

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.000
even more access suffused into spaces.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000
Some of it's transportation access.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000
This is a Mapnificent map that shows me, in this case,

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000
how far I can get from my home in 30 minutes

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.000
using public transportation.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000
Some of it is about walking. It's not all perfect yet.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.000
This is Google Walking Maps.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000
I asked how to do the greater Ridgeway,

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000
and it told me to go via Guernsey.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.000
It did tell me that this route

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000
maybe missing sidewalks or pedestrian paths, though.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.000
(Laughter)

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000
But the technologies are getting better,

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000
and we're starting to really kind of crowdsource this navigation.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.000
And as we just heard earlier,

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.000
of course, we're also learning how to put information on dumb objects.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.000
Things that don't have any wiring in them at all,

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000
we're learning how to include

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.000
in these systems of notation and navigation.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.000
Part of what we're finding with this

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000
is that what we thought

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000
was the major point

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.000
of manufacturing and consumption,

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000
which is to get a bunch of stuff,

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000
is not, in fact,

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.000
how we really live best in dense environments.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.000
What we're finding is that what we want

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.000
is access to the capacities of things.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.000
My favorite example is a drill. Who here owns a drill, a home power drill?

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000
Okay. I do too.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000
The average home power drill is used somewhere between six and 20 minutes

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000
in its entire lifetime,

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000
depending on who you ask.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.000
And so what we do is we buy these drills

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:40.000
that have a potential capacity of thousands of hours of drill time,

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:43.000
use them once or twice to put a hole in the wall and let them sit.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.000
Our cities, I would put to you,

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.000
are stockpiles of these surplus capacities.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.000
And while we could try and figure out

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.000
new ways to use those capacities --

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000
such as cooking or making ice sculptures

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000
or even a mafia hit --

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.000
what we probably will find

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000
is that, in fact, turning those products into services

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000
that we have access to when we want them,

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.000
is a far smarter way to go.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:08.000
And in fact, even space itself is turning into a service.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.000
We're finding that people can share the same spaces,

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.000
do stuff with vacant space.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000
Buildings are becoming bundles of services.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.000
So we have new designs

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.000
that are helping us take mechanical things that we used to spend energy on --

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.000
like heating, cooling etc. --

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:25.000
and turn them into things that we avoid spending energy on.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.000
So we light our buildings with daylight.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.000
We cool them with breezes. We heat them with sunshine.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000
In fact, when we use all these things,

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.000
what we've found is that, in some cases,

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000
energy use in a building can drop as much as 90 percent.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.000
Which brings on another threshold effect

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.000
I like to call furnace dumping,

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.000
which is, quite simply,

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.000
if you have a building that doesn't need to be heated with a furnace,

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.000
you save a whole bunch of money up front.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.000
These things actually become cheaper to build

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.000
than the alternatives.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:53.000
Now when we look at being able

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:56.000
to slash our product use, slash our transportation use,

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.000
slash our building energy use,

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:01.000
all of that is great, but it still leaves something behind.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.000
And if we're going to really, truly become sustainable cities,

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.000
we need to think a little differently.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.000
This is one way to do it.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.000
This is Vancouver's propaganda about how green a city they are.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.000
And certainly lots of people have taken to heart

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:14.000
this idea that a sustainable city is covered in greenery.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.000
So we have visions like this.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:19.000
We have visions like this. We have visions like this.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.000
Now all of these are fine projects,

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:24.000
but they really have missed an essential point,

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000
which is it's not about the leaves above,

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000
it's about the systems below.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.000
Do they, for instance, capture rainwater

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000
so that we can reduce water use?

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:35.000
Water is energy intensive.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.000
Do they, perhaps, include green infrastructure,

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.000
so that we can take runoff

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.000
and water that's going out of our houses

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.000
and clean it and filter it

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.000
and grow urban street trees?

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:48.000
Do they connect us back to the ecosystems around us

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000
by, for example, connecting us to rivers

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.000
and allowing for restoration?

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.000
Do they allow for pollination,

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.000
pollinator pathways

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:59.000
that bees and butterflies and such can come back into our cities?

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.000
Do they even take the very waste matter

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:04.000
that we have from food and fiber and so forth,

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.000
and turn it back into soil

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.000
and sequester carbon --

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.000
take carbon out of the air

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.000
in the process of using our cities?

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.000
I would submit to you that all of these things are not only possible,

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.000
they're being done right now,

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.000
and that it's a darn good thing.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:22.000
Because right now, our economy by and large

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.000
operates as Paul Hawken said,

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.000
"by stealing the future, selling it in the present

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.000
and calling it GDP."

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.000
And if we have another eight billion

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.000
or seven billion,

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.000
or six billion, even, people,

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:37.000
living on a planet where their cities also steal the future,

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.000
we're going to run out of future really fast.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.000
But if we think differently,

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.000
I think that, in fact, we can have cities

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.000
that are not only zero emissions,

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.000
but have unlimited possibilities as well.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.000
Thank you very much.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:52.000
