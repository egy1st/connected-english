00:00:01.190 --> 00:00:03.166
For as long as I can remember,

00:00:03.190 --> 00:00:07.396
I have felt a very deep connection
to animals and to the ocean.

00:00:07.809 --> 00:00:12.631
And at this age, my personal idol
was Flipper the dolphin.

00:00:13.266 --> 00:00:16.109
And when I first learned
about endangered species,

00:00:16.133 --> 00:00:19.823
I was truly distressed to know
that every day,

00:00:19.847 --> 00:00:23.371
animals were being wiped
off the face of this Earth forever.

00:00:23.395 --> 00:00:26.402
And I wanted to do something to help,
but I always wondered:

00:00:26.426 --> 00:00:30.258
What could one person possibly do
to make a difference?

00:00:30.282 --> 00:00:32.293
And it would be 30 years,

00:00:32.317 --> 00:00:35.192
but I would eventually get
the answer to that question.

00:00:36.129 --> 00:00:39.271
When these heartbreaking
images of oiled birds

00:00:39.295 --> 00:00:42.373
finally began to emerge
from the Gulf of Mexico last year

00:00:42.397 --> 00:00:44.722
during the horrific BP oil spill,

00:00:44.746 --> 00:00:48.830
a German biologist by the name
of Silvia Gaus was quoted as saying,

00:00:48.854 --> 00:00:51.538
"We should just euthanize all oiled birds,

00:00:51.562 --> 00:00:52.862
because studies have shown

00:00:52.886 --> 00:00:57.858
that fewer than one percent of them
survive after being released."

00:00:57.882 --> 00:01:00.414
And I could not disagree more.

00:01:00.438 --> 00:01:01.725
In addition,

00:01:01.749 --> 00:01:05.700
I believe that every oiled animal
deserves a second chance at life.

00:01:05.724 --> 00:01:08.752
And I want to tell you why
I feel so strongly about this.

00:01:09.204 --> 00:01:11.237
On June 23, 2000,

00:01:11.261 --> 00:01:15.151
a ship named the Treasure sank
off the coast of Cape Town, South Africa,

00:01:15.175 --> 00:01:17.563
spilling 1,300 tons of fuel,

00:01:17.587 --> 00:01:23.023
which polluted the habitats
of nearly half the entire world population

00:01:23.047 --> 00:01:24.624
of African penguins.

00:01:25.084 --> 00:01:28.193
Now, the ship sank
between Robben Island to the south,

00:01:28.217 --> 00:01:30.567
and Dassen Island to the north --

00:01:30.591 --> 00:01:32.976
two of the penguins' main
breeding islands.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.020
And exactly six years
and three days earlier,

00:01:37.044 --> 00:01:39.766
on June 20, 1994,

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:42.686
a ship named the Apollo Sea
sank near Dassen Island,

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:46.587
oiling 10,000 penguins,
half of which died.

00:01:47.254 --> 00:01:49.051
Now when the Treasure sank in 2000,

00:01:49.075 --> 00:01:51.976
it was the height
of the best breeding season

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.894
scientists had ever recorded
for the African penguin,

00:01:55.918 --> 00:01:58.885
which at the time, was listed
as a threatened species.

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:01.643
And soon, nearly 20,000 penguins

00:02:01.667 --> 00:02:04.078
were covered with this toxic oil.

00:02:04.102 --> 00:02:07.159
The local seabird rescue
center, named SANCCOB,

00:02:07.183 --> 00:02:10.235
immediately launched
a massive rescue operation,

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:14.648
and this soon would become
the largest animal rescue ever undertaken.

00:02:15.215 --> 00:02:17.278
At the time, I was working
down the street.

00:02:17.302 --> 00:02:20.104
I was a penguin aquarist
at the New England Aquarium.

00:02:20.128 --> 00:02:24.188
And exactly 11 years ago yesterday,

00:02:24.212 --> 00:02:26.617
the phone rang in the penguin office.

00:02:26.641 --> 00:02:29.585
And with that call,
my life would change forever.

00:02:29.609 --> 00:02:32.209
It was Estelle van Der Merwe
calling from SANCCOB,

00:02:32.233 --> 00:02:34.070
saying, "Please come help.

00:02:34.094 --> 00:02:36.800
We have thousands of oiled penguins

00:02:36.824 --> 00:02:42.215
and thousands of willing
but completely inexperienced volunteers.

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:45.842
And we need penguin experts
to come train and supervise them."

00:02:45.866 --> 00:02:47.350
So two days later,

00:02:47.374 --> 00:02:49.345
I was on a plane headed for Cape Town

00:02:49.369 --> 00:02:51.393
with a team of penguin specialists.

00:02:52.227 --> 00:02:57.128
And the scene inside of this building
was devastating and surreal.

00:02:57.152 --> 00:03:00.549
In fact, many people
compared it to a war zone.

00:03:00.573 --> 00:03:03.073
Last week, a 10-year-old girl asked me:

00:03:03.734 --> 00:03:07.510
"What did it feel like
when you first walked into that building

00:03:07.534 --> 00:03:10.371
and saw so many oiled penguins?"

00:03:11.722 --> 00:03:13.092
And this is what happened.

00:03:13.116 --> 00:03:16.976
I was instantly transported
back to that moment in time.

00:03:17.862 --> 00:03:21.830
Penguins are very vocal birds
and really, really noisy,

00:03:21.854 --> 00:03:24.351
so I expected to walk into this building

00:03:24.375 --> 00:03:27.976
and be met with this cacophony
of honking and braying and squawking.

00:03:28.351 --> 00:03:29.805
But instead,

00:03:29.829 --> 00:03:33.611
when we stepped through
those doors and into the building,

00:03:33.635 --> 00:03:35.825
it was eerily silent.

00:03:37.306 --> 00:03:38.759
So it was very clear

00:03:38.783 --> 00:03:41.903
these were stressed,
sick, traumatized birds.

00:03:42.808 --> 00:03:45.147
The other thing that was so striking

00:03:45.171 --> 00:03:48.099
was the sheer number of volunteers.

00:03:48.123 --> 00:03:51.393
Up to 1,000 people a day
came to the rescue center.

00:03:51.837 --> 00:03:53.976
Eventually, over the course
of this rescue,

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.429
more than 12-and-a-half
thousand volunteers

00:03:57.453 --> 00:03:59.772
came from all over the world to Cape Town,

00:03:59.796 --> 00:04:01.375
to help save these birds.

00:04:01.399 --> 00:04:05.994
And the amazing thing
was that not one of them had to be there.

00:04:06.018 --> 00:04:07.169
Yet they were.

00:04:07.193 --> 00:04:10.498
So for the few of us that were there
in a professional capacity,

00:04:10.522 --> 00:04:13.976
this extraordinary volunteer response
to this animal crisis

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.498
was profoundly moving and awe-inspiring.

00:04:17.522 --> 00:04:18.879
So the day after we arrived,

00:04:18.903 --> 00:04:21.808
two of us from the aquarium
were put in charge of room two.

00:04:21.832 --> 00:04:26.031
Room two had more
than 4,000 oiled penguins in it.

00:04:26.055 --> 00:04:27.206
Now, mind you --

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:30.523
three days earlier,
we had 60 penguins under our care,

00:04:30.547 --> 00:04:32.860
so we were definitely overwhelmed

00:04:32.884 --> 00:04:35.808
and just a bit terrified --
at least I was.

00:04:35.832 --> 00:04:37.833
Personally, I really didn't know

00:04:37.857 --> 00:04:42.234
if I was capable of handling
such a monstrous task.

00:04:42.258 --> 00:04:43.567
And collectively,

00:04:43.591 --> 00:04:46.568
we really didn't know
if we could pull this off.

00:04:46.592 --> 00:04:49.874
Because we all knew
that just six years earlier,

00:04:49.898 --> 00:04:52.913
half as many penguins
had been oiled and rescued,

00:04:52.937 --> 00:04:55.865
and only half of them had survived.

00:04:55.889 --> 00:05:00.105
So would it be humanly possible
to save this many oiled penguins?

00:05:00.129 --> 00:05:01.679
We just did not know.

00:05:02.481 --> 00:05:03.780
But what gave us hope

00:05:03.804 --> 00:05:07.199
were these incredibly dedicated
and brave volunteers,

00:05:07.223 --> 00:05:10.066
three of whom here
are force-feeding penguins.

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:12.614
You may notice they're wearing
very thick gloves.

00:05:12.638 --> 00:05:15.129
And what you should know
about African penguins

00:05:15.153 --> 00:05:18.081
is that they have razor-sharp beaks.

00:05:18.105 --> 00:05:19.279
And before long,

00:05:19.303 --> 00:05:22.136
our bodies were covered head to toe

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:25.531
with these nasty wounds
inflicted by the terrified penguins.

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:29.715
Now the day after we arrived,
a new crisis began to unfold.

00:05:29.739 --> 00:05:32.942
The oil slick was now moving
north towards Dassen Island,

00:05:32.966 --> 00:05:35.235
and the rescuers despaired,

00:05:35.259 --> 00:05:37.394
because they knew if the oil hit,

00:05:37.418 --> 00:05:40.267
it would not be possible
to rescue any more oiled birds.

00:05:40.291 --> 00:05:42.275
And there really were no good solutions.

00:05:42.299 --> 00:05:43.450
But then finally,

00:05:43.474 --> 00:05:46.419
one of the researchers
threw out this crazy idea.

00:05:46.443 --> 00:05:50.069
He said, "OK, why don't we try
and collect the birds

00:05:50.093 --> 00:05:52.068
at the greatest risk of getting oiled" --

00:05:52.092 --> 00:05:53.835
they collected 20,000 --

00:05:53.859 --> 00:05:58.466
"and we'll ship them 500 miles
up the coast to Port Elizabeth

00:05:58.490 --> 00:05:59.793
in these open-air trucks,

00:05:59.817 --> 00:06:02.000
and release them
into the clean waters there

00:06:02.024 --> 00:06:03.453
and let them swim back home?"

00:06:04.056 --> 00:06:06.066
(Laughter)

00:06:08.145 --> 00:06:11.463
So three of those penguins --
Peter, Pamela and Percy --

00:06:11.487 --> 00:06:12.638
wore satellite tags,

00:06:12.662 --> 00:06:14.641
and the researchers crossed their fingers

00:06:14.665 --> 00:06:16.906
and hoped that by the time
they got back home,

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:19.155
the oil would be cleaned up
from their islands.

00:06:19.179 --> 00:06:22.100
And luckily, the day they arrived, it was.

00:06:22.124 --> 00:06:26.043
So it had been a huge gamble,
but it had paid off.

00:06:26.067 --> 00:06:28.977
And so they know now
that they can use this strategy

00:06:29.001 --> 00:06:30.485
in future oil spills.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:34.354
So in wildlife rescue as in life,

00:06:34.378 --> 00:06:36.520
we learn from each previous experience,

00:06:36.544 --> 00:06:40.750
and we learn from both
our successes and our failures.

00:06:40.774 --> 00:06:45.179
And the main thing learned
during the Apollo Sea rescue in '94

00:06:45.203 --> 00:06:49.582
was that most of those penguins
had died due to the unwitting use

00:06:49.606 --> 00:06:52.898
of poorly ventilated
transport boxes and trucks,

00:06:52.922 --> 00:06:54.824
because they just had not been prepared

00:06:54.848 --> 00:06:57.165
to deal with so many
oiled penguins at once.

00:06:57.189 --> 00:07:00.103
So in these six years
between these two oil spills,

00:07:00.127 --> 00:07:03.460
they've built thousands
of these well-ventilated boxes.

00:07:03.484 --> 00:07:06.357
And as a result,
during the Treasure rescue,

00:07:06.381 --> 00:07:10.976
just 160 penguins died
during the transport process,

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:12.977
as opposed to 5,000.

00:07:13.001 --> 00:07:15.396
So this alone was a huge victory.

00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:17.995
Something else learned
during the Apollo rescue

00:07:18.019 --> 00:07:19.515
was how to train the penguins

00:07:19.539 --> 00:07:22.516
to take fish freely from their hands,

00:07:22.540 --> 00:07:24.479
using these training boxes.

00:07:24.503 --> 00:07:27.976
And we used this technique again
during the Treasure rescue.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:32.710
But an interesting thing was noted
during the training process.

00:07:32.734 --> 00:07:36.192
The first penguins to make
that transition to free feeding

00:07:36.216 --> 00:07:39.156
were the ones that had
a metal band on their wing

00:07:39.180 --> 00:07:42.609
from the Apollo Sea spill
six years earlier.

00:07:42.633 --> 00:07:45.976
So penguins learn
from previous experience, too.

00:07:46.902 --> 00:07:50.654
So all of those penguins had to have
the oil meticulously cleaned

00:07:50.678 --> 00:07:51.836
from their bodies.

00:07:51.860 --> 00:07:56.663
It would take two people at least an hour
just to clean one penguin.

00:07:56.687 --> 00:07:57.976
When you clean a penguin,

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.206
you first have to spray it
with a degreaser.

00:08:00.230 --> 00:08:03.911
And this brings me to my favorite story
from the Treasure rescue.

00:08:04.276 --> 00:08:06.867
About a year prior to this oil spill,

00:08:06.891 --> 00:08:10.336
a 17-year-old student
had invented a degreaser.

00:08:10.669 --> 00:08:13.486
And they'd been using it
at SANCCOB with great success,

00:08:13.510 --> 00:08:16.159
so they began using it
during the Treasure rescue.

00:08:16.183 --> 00:08:19.183
But partway through, they ran out.

00:08:19.571 --> 00:08:22.448
So in a panic, Estelle
from SANCCOB called the student

00:08:22.472 --> 00:08:24.508
and said, "Please, you have to make more!"

00:08:24.532 --> 00:08:25.785
So he raced to the lab

00:08:25.809 --> 00:08:28.887
and made enough to clean
the rest of the birds.

00:08:28.911 --> 00:08:31.695
So I just think it is the coolest thing

00:08:31.719 --> 00:08:35.257
that a teenager invented a product

00:08:35.281 --> 00:08:38.853
that helped save the lives
of thousands of animals.

00:08:39.297 --> 00:08:42.805
So what happened
to those 20,000 oiled penguins?

00:08:42.829 --> 00:08:44.842
And was Silvia Gaus right?

00:08:44.866 --> 00:08:48.262
Should we routinely euthanize
all oiled birds

00:08:48.286 --> 00:08:50.518
because most of them
are going to die anyway?

00:08:50.542 --> 00:08:52.976
Well, she could not be more wrong.

00:08:53.653 --> 00:08:57.976
After half a million hours
of grueling volunteer labor,

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.383
more than 90 percent
of those oiled penguins

00:09:00.407 --> 00:09:02.976
were successfully returned to the wild.

00:09:03.415 --> 00:09:05.605
And we know from follow-up studies

00:09:05.629 --> 00:09:09.736
that they have lived just as long
as never-oiled penguins,

00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:12.053
and bred nearly as successfully.

00:09:12.482 --> 00:09:13.633
And in addition,

00:09:13.657 --> 00:09:17.486
about 3,000 penguin chicks
were rescued and hand raised.

00:09:17.510 --> 00:09:20.179
And again, we know
from long-term monitoring

00:09:20.203 --> 00:09:26.091
that more of these hand-raised chicks
survive to adulthood and breeding age

00:09:26.115 --> 00:09:28.210
than do parent-raised chicks.

00:09:28.234 --> 00:09:31.690
Armed with this knowledge,
SANCCOB has a chick-bolstering project,

00:09:31.714 --> 00:09:34.690
and every year, they rescue
and raise abandoned chicks,

00:09:34.714 --> 00:09:39.238
and they have a very impressive,
80 percent success rate.

00:09:39.262 --> 00:09:41.122
This is critically important,

00:09:41.146 --> 00:09:43.574
because one year ago,

00:09:43.598 --> 00:09:46.511
the African penguin
was declared endangered.

00:09:46.948 --> 00:09:50.754
And they could be extinct
in less than 10 years

00:09:50.778 --> 00:09:53.659
if we don't do something
now to protect them.

00:09:53.683 --> 00:09:54.976
So what did I learn

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:58.180
from this intense
and unforgettable experience?

00:09:58.204 --> 00:10:01.768
Personally, I learned that I am capable
of handling so much more

00:10:01.792 --> 00:10:03.528
than I ever dreamed possible.

00:10:03.552 --> 00:10:07.461
And I learned that one person
can make a huge difference.

00:10:07.485 --> 00:10:09.493
Just look at that 17-year-old.

00:10:09.517 --> 00:10:13.144
And when we come together and work as one,

00:10:13.168 --> 00:10:15.942
we can achieve extraordinary things.

00:10:15.966 --> 00:10:19.942
And truly, to be a part of something
so much larger than yourself

00:10:19.966 --> 00:10:23.642
is the most rewarding experience
you can possibly have.

00:10:24.603 --> 00:10:26.991
So I'd like to leave you
with one final thought

00:10:27.015 --> 00:10:28.588
and a challenge, if you will.

00:10:28.612 --> 00:10:32.803
My mission as The Penguin Lady
is to raise awareness and funding

00:10:32.827 --> 00:10:34.755
to protect penguins.

00:10:34.779 --> 00:10:37.246
But why should any of you
care about penguins?

00:10:37.270 --> 00:10:40.976
Well, you should care
because they're an indicator species.

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:45.881
And simply put: if penguins are dying,
it means our oceans are dying.

00:10:45.905 --> 00:10:47.921
And we ultimately will be affected,

00:10:47.945 --> 00:10:50.086
because, as Sylvia Earle says,

00:10:50.110 --> 00:10:52.976
"The oceans are our life-support system."

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.476
And the two main threats to penguins today

00:10:55.500 --> 00:10:58.106
are overfishing and global warming.

00:10:58.130 --> 00:10:59.290
And these are two things

00:10:59.314 --> 00:11:03.988
that each one of us actually has
the power to do something about.

00:11:04.012 --> 00:11:08.169
So if we each do our part, together,
we can make a difference,

00:11:08.193 --> 00:11:11.207
and we can help keep
penguins from going extinct.

00:11:11.622 --> 00:11:15.048
Humans have always been the greatest
threat to penguins,

00:11:15.072 --> 00:11:17.167
but we are now their only hope.

00:11:17.191 --> 00:11:18.342
Thank you.

00:11:18.366 --> 00:11:23.111
