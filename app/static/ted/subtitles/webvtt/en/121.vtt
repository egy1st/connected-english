WEBVTT

00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.000
The immersive ugliness

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000
of our everyday environments in America

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
is entropy made visible.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
We can't overestimate the amount of despair

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
that we are generating with places like this.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
And mostly, I want to persuade you that we have to do better

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.000
if we're going to continue the project of civilization in America.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
By the way, this doesn't help.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Nobody's having a better day down here because of that.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
There are a lot of ways you can describe this.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
You know, I like to call it "the national automobile slum."

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
You can call it suburban sprawl.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
I think it's appropriate to call it

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.000
the greatest misallocation of resources in the history of the world.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.000
You can call it a technosis externality clusterfuck.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.000
And it's a tremendous problem for us.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
The outstanding -- the salient problem about this for us

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
is that these are places that are not worth caring about.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
We're going to talk about that some more.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
A sense of place:

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:27.000
your ability to create places that are meaningful and places of quality and character

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.000
depends entirely on your ability to define space with buildings,

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000
and to employ the vocabularies, grammars,

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000
syntaxes, rhythms and patterns of architecture

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
in order to inform us who we are.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:49.000
The public realm in America has two roles:

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:54.000
it is the dwelling place of our civilization and our civic life,

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.000
and it is the physical manifestation of the common good.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
And when you degrade the public realm,

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
you will automatically degrade the quality of your civic life

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:14.000
and the character of all the enactments of your public life and communal life that take place there.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:19.000
The public realm comes mostly in the form of the street in America

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.000
because we don't have the 1,000-year-old cathedral plazas

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.000
and market squares of older cultures.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:35.000
And your ability to define space and to create places that are worth caring about

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:40.000
all comes from a body of culture that we call the culture of civic design.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:45.000
This is a body of knowledge, method, skill and principle

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:50.000
that we threw in the garbage after World War II

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000
and decided we don't need that anymore; we're not going to use it.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.000
And consequently, we can see the result all around us.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:03.000
The public realm has to inform us not only where we are geographically,

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.000
but it has to inform us where we are in our culture.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:12.000
Where we've come from, what kind of people we are, and it needs to,

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:18.000
by doing that, it needs to afford us a glimpse to where we're going

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:23.000
in order to allow us to dwell in a hopeful present.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000
And if there is one tremendous --

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.000
if there is one great catastrophe about the places that we've built,

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.000
the human environments we've made for ourselves in the last 50 years,

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:41.000
it is that it has deprived us of the ability to live in a hopeful present.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:45.000
The environments we are living in, more typically, are like these.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:51.000
You know, this happens to be the asteroid belt of architectural garbage two miles north of my town.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:55.000
And remember, to create a place of character and quality,

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000
you have to be able to define space.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
So how is that being accomplished here?

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.000
If you stand on the apron of the Wal-Mart over here

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000
and try to look at the Target store over here,

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:10.000
you can't see it because of the curvature of the Earth. (Laughter)

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:16.000
That's nature's way of telling you that you're doing a poor job of defining space.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.000
Consequently, these will be places that nobody wants to be in.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:23.000
These will be places that are not worth caring about.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.000
We have about, you know, 38,000 places

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
that are not worth caring about in the United States today.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:34.000
When we have enough of them, we're going to have a nation that's not worth defending.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.000
And I want you to think about that when you think about

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000
those young men and women who are over in places like Iraq,

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000
spilling their blood in the sand,

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:47.000
and ask yourself, "What is their last thought of home?"

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:51.000
I hope it's not the curb cut between the Chuck E. Cheese and the Target store

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:57.000
because that's not good enough for Americans to be spilling their blood for. (Applause)

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000
We need better places in this country.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000
Public space. This is a good public space.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.000
It's a place worth caring about. It's well defined.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.000
It is emphatically an outdoor public room.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.000
It has something that is terribly important --

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.000
it has what's called an active and permeable membrane around the edge.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:19.000
That's a fancy way of saying it's got shops, bars, bistros, destinations --

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.000
things go in and out of it. It's permeable.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.000
The beer goes in and out, the waitresses go in and out,

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:30.000
and that activates the center of this place and makes it a place that people want to hang out in.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:34.000
You know, in these places in other cultures,

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:38.000
people just go there voluntarily because they like them.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.000
We don't have to have a craft fair here to get people to come here. (Laughter)

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.000
You know, you don't have to have a Kwanzaa festival.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.000
People just go because it's pleasurable to be there.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.000
But this is how we do it in the United States.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.000
Probably the most significant public space failure in America,

00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:00.000
designed by the leading architects of the day, Harry Cobb and I.M. Pei:

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000
Boston City Hall Plaza.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:08.000
A public place so dismal that the winos don't even want to go there. (Laughter)

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.000
And we can't fix it because I.M. Pei's still alive,

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.000
and every year Harvard and M.I.T. have a joint committee to repair it.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:18.000
And every year they fail to because they don't want to hurt I.M. Pei's feelings.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000
This is the other side of the building.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:25.000
This was the winner of an international design award in, I think, 1966, something like that.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:28.000
It wasn't Pei and Cobb, another firm designed this,

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:37.000
but there's not enough Prozac in the world to make people feel OK about going down this block.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.000
This is the back of Boston City Hall,

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:47.000
the most important, you know, significant civic building in Albany -- excuse me -- in Boston.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000
And what is the message that is coming,

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.000
what are the vocabularies and grammars that are coming, from this building

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.000
and how is it informing us about who we are?

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:01.000
This, in fact, would be a better building if we put mosaic portraits

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:06.000
of Josef Stalin, Pol Pot, Saddam Hussein,

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.000
and all the other great despots of the 20th century on the side of the building,

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:14.000
because then we'd honestly be saying what the building is really communicating to us.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.000
You know, that it's a despotic building;

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:24.000
it wants us to feel like termites. (Laughter)

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.000
This is it on a smaller scale:

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.000
the back of the civic center in my town, Saratoga Springs, New York.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:35.000
By the way, when I showed this slide to a group of Kiwanians in my town,

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:40.000
they all rose in indignation from their creamed chicken, (Laughter)

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.000
and they shouted at me and said,

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:47.000
"It was raining that day when you took that picture!"

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:57.000
Because this was perceived to be a weather problem. (Laughter)

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:04.000
You know, this is a building designed like a DVD player. (Laughter)

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:09.000
Audio jack, power supply --

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:14.000
and look, you know these things are important architectural jobs for firms, right?

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.000
You know, we hire firms to design these things.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:20.000
You can see exactly what went on, three o'clock in the morning at the design meeting.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.000
You know, eight hours before deadline,

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:26.000
four architects trying to get this building in on time, right?

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:29.000
And they're sitting there at the long boardroom table

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000
with all the drawings, and the renderings,

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:35.000
and all the Chinese food caskets are lying on the table, and --

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:39.000
I mean, what was the conversation that was going on there? (Laughter)

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:44.000
Because you know what the last word was, what the last sentence was of that meeting.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:51.000
It was: "Fuck it." (Laughter) (Applause)

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:57.000
That -- that is the message of this form of architecture.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:02.000
The message is: We don't give a fuck! We don't give a fuck.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:06.000
So I went back on the nicest day of the year, just to --

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.000
you know -- do some reality testing,

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:12.000
and in fact, he will not even go down there because (Laughter)

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.000
it's not interesting enough for his clients,

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:17.000
you know, the burglars, the muggers.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:21.000
It's not civically rich enough for them to go down there.

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:23.000
OK.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.000
The pattern of Main Street USA --

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:32.000
in fact, this pattern of building downtown blocks, all over the world, is fairly universal.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.000
It's not that complicated:

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:40.000
buildings more than one story high, built out to the sidewalk edge,

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:43.000
so that people who are, you know, all kinds of people can get into the building.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:47.000
Other activities are allowed to occur upstairs,

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:50.000
you know, apartments, offices, and so on.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:54.000
You make provision for this activity called shopping on the ground floor.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.000
They haven't learned that in Monterey.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:00.000
If you go out to the corner right at the main intersection right in front of this conference center,

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.000
you'll see an intersection with four blank walls on every corner.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.000
It's really incredible.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:09.000
Anyway, this is how you compose and assemble a downtown business building,

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:12.000
and this is what happened when in Glens Falls, New York,

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.000
when we tried to do it again, where it was missing, right?

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:20.000
So the first thing they do is they pop up the retail a half a story above grade to make it sporty.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:26.000
OK. That completely destroys the relationship between the business and the sidewalk,

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:29.000
where the theoretical pedestrians are. (Laughter)

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:33.000
Of course, they'll never be there, as long as this is in that condition.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:37.000
Then because the relationship between the retail is destroyed,

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:40.000
we pop a handicapped ramp on that,

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:44.000
and then to make ourselves feel better, we put a nature Band-Aid in front of it.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.000
And that's how we do it.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:50.000
I call them "nature Band-Aids" because there's a general idea in America

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:55.000
that the remedy for mutilated urbanism is nature.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:11:02.000
And in fact, the remedy for wounded and mutilated urbanism is good urbanism, good buildings.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:08.000
Not just flower beds, not just cartoons of the Sierra Nevada Mountains.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:09.000
You know, that's not good enough.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.000
We have to do good buildings.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:14.000
The street trees have really four jobs to do and that's it:

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:17.000
To spatially denote the pedestrian realm,

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:22.000
to protect the pedestrians from the vehicles in the carriageway,

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:25.000
to filter the sunlight onto the sidewalk,

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.000
and to soften the hardscape of the buildings

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:31.000
and to create a ceiling -- a vaulted ceiling -- over the street, at its best.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:35.000
And that's it. Those are the four jobs of the street trees.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:38.000
They're not supposed to be a cartoon of the North Woods;

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:43.000
they're not supposed to be a set for "The Last of the Mohicans."

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:51.000
You know, one of the problems with the fiasco of suburbia is that it destroyed our understanding

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:55.000
of the distinction between the country and the town, between the urban and the rural.

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:57.000
They're not the same thing.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:01.000
And we're not going to cure the problems of the urban by dragging the country into the city,

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.000
which is what a lot of us are trying to do all the time.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:07.000
Here you see it on a small scale -- the mothership has landed,

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:13.000
R2-D2 and C-3PO have stepped out to test the bark mulch

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:16.000
to see if they can inhabit this planet. (Laughter)

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:23.000
A lot of this comes from the fact that the industrial city in America was such a trauma

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:27.000
that we developed this tremendous aversion for the whole idea of the city,

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:29.000
city life, and everything connected with it.

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:34.000
And so what you see fairly early, in the mid-19th century,

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:38.000
is this idea that we now have to have an antidote to the industrial city,

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:41.000
which is going to be life in the country for everybody.

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:45.000
And that starts to be delivered in the form of the railroad suburb:

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:48.000
the country villa along the railroad line,

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:51.000
which allows people to enjoy the amenity of the city,

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.000
but to return to the countryside every night.

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:56.000
And believe me, there were no Wal-Marts or convenience stores out there then,

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.000
so it really was a form of country living.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:02.000
But what happens is, of course, it mutates over the next 80 years

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:04.000
and it turns into something rather insidious.

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:09.000
It becomes a cartoon of a country house, in a cartoon of the country.

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:14.000
And that's the great non-articulated agony of suburbia

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.000
and one of the reasons that it lends itself to ridicule.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:21.000
Because it hasn't delivered what it's been promising for half a century now.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:25.000
And these are typically the kind of dwellings we find there, you know.

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:28.000
Basically, a house with nothing on the side

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.000
because this house wants to state, emphatically,

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:33.000
"I'm a little cabin in the woods. There's nothing on either side of me.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:36.000
I don't have any eyes on the side of my head. I can't see."

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:39.000
So you have this one last facade of the house,

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:42.000
the front, which is really a cartoon of a facade of a house.

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.000
Because -- notice the porch here.

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:51.000
Unless the people that live here are Munchkins, nobody's going to be using that.

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:57.000
This is really, in fact, a television broadcasting a show 24/7 called "We're Normal."

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:00.000
We're normal, we're normal, we're normal, we're normal, we're normal.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.000
Please respect us, we're normal, we're normal, we're normal.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.000
But we know what's going on in these houses, you know.

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:08.000
We know that little Skippy is loading his Uzi down here,

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:12.000
getting ready for homeroom. (Laughter)

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:15.000
We know that Heather, his sister Heather, 14 years old,

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:18.000
is turning tricks up here to support her drug habit.

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:21.000
Because these places, these habitats,

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:26.000
are inducing immense amounts of anxiety and depression in children,

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:30.000
and they don't have a lot of experience with medication.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.000
So they take the first one that comes along, often.

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.000
These are not good enough for Americans.

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:37.000
These are the schools we are sending them to:

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:43.000
The Hannibal Lecter Central School, Las Vegas, Nevada.

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:45.000
This is a real school!

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:49.000
You know, but there's obviously a notion that if you let the inmates of this thing out,

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:53.000
that they would snatch a motorist off the street and eat his liver.

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:58.000
So every effort is made to keep them within the building.

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:04.000
Notice that nature is present. (Laughter)

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:07.000
We're going to have to change this behavior whether we like it or not.

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:12.000
We are entering an epochal period of change in the world, and -- certainly in America

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:17.000
-- the period that will be characterized by the end of the cheap oil era.

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:21.000
It is going to change absolutely everything.

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:24.000
Chris asked me not to go on too long about this, and I won't,

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:27.000
except to say there's not going to be a hydrogen economy.

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:29.000
Forget it. It's not going to happen.

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:31.000
We're going to have to do something else instead.

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:36.000
We're going to have to down-scale, re-scale, and re-size

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:40.000
virtually everything we do in this country and we can't start soon enough to do it.

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:44.000
We're going to have -- (Applause) -- we're going to have to live closer to where we work.

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:46.000
We're going to have to live closer to each other.

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:50.000
We're going have to grow more food closer to where we live.

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:55.000
The age of the 3,000 mile Caesar salad is coming to an end.

00:15:55.000 --> 00:16:00.000
We're going to have to -- we have a railroad system that the Bulgarians would be ashamed of!

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:02.000
We gotta do better than that!

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:05.000
And we should have started two days before yesterday.

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:10.000
We are fortunate that the new urbanists were there, for the last 10 years,

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:14.000
excavating all that information that was thrown in the garbage

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:17.000
by our parents' generation after World War II.

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:19.000
Because we're going to need it if we're going to learn how to reconstruct towns.

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:25.000
We're going to need to get back this body of methodology and principle and skill

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:31.000
in order to re-learn how to compose meaningful places, places that are integral,

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:38.000
that allow -- that are living organisms in the sense that they contain all the organs of our civic life

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:43.000
and our communal life, deployed in an integral fashion.

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:46.000
So that, you know, the residences make sense

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:51.000
deployed in relation to the places of business, of culture and of governance.

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:55.000
We're going to have to re-learn what the building blocks of these things are:

00:16:55.000 --> 00:17:01.000
the street, the block, how to compose public space that's both large and small,

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:04.000
the courtyard, the civic square

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:07.000
and how to really make use of this property.

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:10.000
We can see some of the first ideas

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:15.000
for retro-fitting some of the catastrophic property that we have in America.

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:18.000
The dead malls: what are we going to do with them?

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:20.000
Well, in point of fact, most of them are not going to make it.

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:22.000
They're not going to be retro-fitted;

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:24.000
they're going to be the salvage yards of the future.

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:26.000
Some of them we're going to fix, though.

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:30.000
And we're going to fix them by imposing back on them street and block systems

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:35.000
and returning to the building lot as the normal increment of development.

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:42.000
And if we're lucky, the result will be revivified town centers and neighborhood centers

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:44.000
in our existing towns and cities.

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:49.000
And by the way, our towns and cities are where they are, and grew where they were

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:51.000
because they occupy all the important sites.

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:54.000
And most of them are still going to be there,

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:59.000
although the scale of them is probably going to be diminished.

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:01.000
We've got a lot of work to do.

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:06.000
We're not going to be rescued by the hyper-car; we're not going to be rescued by alternative fuels.

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:09.000
No amount or combination of alternative fuels

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:13.000
is going to allow us to continue running what we're running, the way we're running it.

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:16.000
We're going to have to do everything very differently.

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:18.000
And America's not prepared.

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:21.000
We are sleepwalking into the future.

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:24.000
We're not ready for what's coming at us.

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:27.000
So I urge you all to do what you can.

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:34.000
Life in the mid-21st century is going to be about living locally.

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:36.000
Be prepared to be good neighbors.

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:42.000
Be prepared to find vocations that make you useful

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:44.000
to your neighbors and to your fellow citizens.

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:47.000
One final thing -- I've been very disturbed about this for years,

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:50.000
but I think it's particularly important for this audience.

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:55.000
Please, please, stop referring to yourselves as "consumers." OK?

00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:58.000
Consumers are different than citizens.

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:03.000
Consumers do not have obligations, responsibilities and duties

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:05.000
to their fellow human beings.

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:08.000
And as long as you're using that word consumer in the public discussion,

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:12.000
you will be degrading the quality of the discussion we're having.

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:15.000
And we're going to continue being clueless

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:18.000
going into this very difficult future that we face.

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:19.000
So thank you very much.

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:25.000
Please go out and do what you can to make this a land full of places that are worth caring about

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:28.000
and a nation that will be worth defending. (Applause)
