00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Planetary systems outside our own

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
are like distant cities whose lights we can see twinkling,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
but whose streets we can't walk.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
By studying those twinkling lights though,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
we can learn about how stars and planets interact

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
to form their own ecosystem

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
and make habitats that are amenable to life.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
In this image of the Tokyo skyline,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
I've hidden data

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
from the newest planet-hunting space telescope on the block,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
the Kepler Mission.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Can you see it?

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
There we go.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
This is just a tiny part of the sky the Kepler stares at,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
where it searches for planets

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
by measuring the light from over 150,000 stars,

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
all at once, every half hour,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
and very precisely.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
And what we're looking for

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
is the tiny dimming of light

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
that is caused by a planet passing in front of one of these stars

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
and blocking some of that starlight from getting to us.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
In just over two years of operations,

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
we've found over 1,200

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
potential new planetary systems around other stars.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
To give you some perspective,

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
in the previous two decades of searching,

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
we had only known about 400

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
prior to Kepler.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
When we see these little dips in the light,

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
we can determine a number of things.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
For one thing, we can determine that there's a planet there,

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
but also how big that planet is

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
and how far it is away from its parent star.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
That distance is really important

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
because it tells us

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
how much light the planet receives overall.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
And that distance and knowing that amount of light is important

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
because it's a little like you or I sitting around a campfire:

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
You want to be close enough to the campfire so that you're warm,

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
but not so close

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
that you're too toasty and you get burned.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
However, there's more to know about your parent star

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
than just how much light you receive overall.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
And I'll tell you why.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
This is our star. This is our Sun.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
It's shown here in visible light.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
That's the light that you can see with your own human eyes.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
You'll notice that it looks pretty much

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
like the iconic yellow ball --

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
that Sun that we all draw when we're children.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
But you'll notice something else,

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
and that's that the face of the Sun

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
has freckles.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
These freckles are called sunspots,

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
and they are just one of the manifestations

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
of the Sun's magnetic field.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000
They also cause the light from the star to vary.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
And we can measure this

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000
very, very precisely with Kepler and trace their effects.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000
However, these are just the tip of the iceberg.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000
If we had UV eyes or X-ray eyes,

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
we would really see

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
the dynamic and dramatic effects

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
of our Sun's magnetic activity --

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000
the kind of thing that happens on other stars as well.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
Just think, even when it's cloudy outside,

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
these kind of events are happening

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000
in the sky above you all the time.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
So when we want to learn whether a planet is habitable,

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
whether it might be amenable to life,

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
we want to know not only how much total light it receives

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
and how warm it is,

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
but we want to know about its space weather --

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
this high-energy radiation,

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
the UV and the X-rays

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
that are created by its star

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
and that bathe it in this bath of high-energy radiation.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000
And so, we can't really look

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000
at planets around other stars

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
in the same kind of detail

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000
that we can look at planets in our own solar system.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
I'm showing here Venus, Earth and Mars --

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000
three planets in our own solar system that are roughly the same size,

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
but only one of which

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
is really a good place to live.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000
But what we can do in the meantime

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.000
is measure the light from our stars

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
and learn about this relationship

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
between the planets and their parent stars

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
to suss out clues

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000
about which planets might be good places

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000
to look for life in the universe.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000
Kepler won't find a planet

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000
around every single star it looks at.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000
But really, every measurement it makes

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000
is precious,

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000
because it's teaching us about the relationship

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000
between stars and planets,

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000
and how it's really the starlight

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000
that sets the stage

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000
for the formation of life in the universe.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
While it's Kepler the telescope, the instrument that stares,

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
it's we, life, who are searching.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
Thank you.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000
(Applause)
