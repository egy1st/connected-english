00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:03.257
So the type of magic I like,
and I'm a magician,

00:00:03.281 --> 00:00:06.455
is magic that uses technology
to create illusions.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.810
So I would like to show you
something I've been working on.

00:00:09.834 --> 00:00:11.081
It's an application

00:00:11.105 --> 00:00:15.748
that I think will be useful for artists --
multimedia artists in particular.

00:00:15.772 --> 00:00:19.765
It synchronizes videos
across multiple screens of mobile devices.

00:00:20.161 --> 00:00:23.082
I borrowed these three iPods
from people here in the audience

00:00:23.106 --> 00:00:24.312
to show you what I mean.

00:00:27.776 --> 00:00:32.444
And I'm going to use them to tell you
a little bit about my favorite subject:

00:00:32.468 --> 00:00:33.532
deception.

00:00:36.731 --> 00:00:38.752
(Music)

00:00:38.776 --> 00:00:43.495
One of my favorite magicians
is Karl Germain.

00:00:43.519 --> 00:00:47.982
He had this wonderful trick
where a rosebush would bloom

00:00:48.006 --> 00:00:49.875
right in front of your eyes.

00:00:50.442 --> 00:00:55.693
But it was his production of a butterfly
that was the most beautiful.

00:00:55.717 --> 00:00:58.574
(Recording) Announcer:
Ladies and gentlemen,

00:00:58.598 --> 00:01:00.976
the creation of life.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.976
(Applause)

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.691
(Music)

00:01:06.715 --> 00:01:08.933
Marco Tempest: When asked about deception,

00:01:08.957 --> 00:01:10.061
he said this:

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:14.909
Announcer: Magic
is the only honest profession.

00:01:15.451 --> 00:01:18.084
A magician promises to deceive you --

00:01:18.108 --> 00:01:19.494
and he does.

00:01:19.518 --> 00:01:22.991
MT: I like to think of myself
as an honest magician.

00:01:23.015 --> 00:01:24.702
I use a lot of tricks,

00:01:24.726 --> 00:01:28.670
which means that sometimes
I have to lie to you.

00:01:29.576 --> 00:01:32.194
Now I feel bad about that.

00:01:32.639 --> 00:01:35.116
But people lie every day.

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:36.164
(Ringing)

00:01:36.188 --> 00:01:37.201
Hold on.

00:01:37.225 --> 00:01:38.880
Phone: Hey, where are you?

00:01:38.904 --> 00:01:41.266
MT: Stuck in traffic. I'll be there soon.

00:01:41.997 --> 00:01:43.068
You've all done it.

00:01:43.488 --> 00:01:44.980
(Laughter)

00:01:45.004 --> 00:01:46.028
(Music)

00:01:46.052 --> 00:01:48.401
Right: I'll be ready
in just a minute, darling.

00:01:48.425 --> 00:01:51.203
Center: It's just what I've always wanted.

00:01:51.646 --> 00:01:52.976
Left: You were great.

00:01:53.733 --> 00:01:55.487
MT: Deception,

00:01:55.511 --> 00:01:58.492
it's a fundamental part of life.

00:01:59.248 --> 00:02:00.653
Now polls show

00:02:00.677 --> 00:02:04.976
that men tell twice
as many lies as women --

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.896
assuming the women
they asked told the truth.

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.055
(Laughing)

00:02:09.079 --> 00:02:11.976
We deceive to gain advantage

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.386
and to hide our weaknesses.

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:20.976
The Chinese general Sun Tzu said
that all war was based on deception.

00:02:21.846 --> 00:02:25.976
Oscar Wilde said
the same thing of romance.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.713
Some people deceive

00:02:28.737 --> 00:02:29.952
for money.

00:02:30.284 --> 00:02:31.947
Let's play a game.

00:02:33.292 --> 00:02:35.661
Three cards, three chances.

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:39.284
Announcer: One five will get you 10,
10 will get you 20.

00:02:39.308 --> 00:02:41.160
Now, where's the lady?

00:02:41.184 --> 00:02:42.704
Where is the queen?

00:02:43.898 --> 00:02:44.976
MT: This one?

00:02:45.488 --> 00:02:47.577
Sorry. You lose.

00:02:47.601 --> 00:02:50.130
Well, I didn't deceive you.

00:02:50.154 --> 00:02:52.771
You deceived yourself.

00:02:53.352 --> 00:02:54.614
Self-deception.

00:02:55.305 --> 00:02:59.197
That's when we convince ourselves
that a lie is the truth.

00:02:59.603 --> 00:03:02.000
Sometimes it's hard to tell the two apart.

00:03:04.905 --> 00:03:08.471
Compulsive gamblers
are experts at self-deception.

00:03:08.495 --> 00:03:10.114
(Slot machine)

00:03:10.138 --> 00:03:12.090
They believe they can win.

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:15.313
They forget the times they lose.

00:03:15.337 --> 00:03:18.126
The brain is very good at forgetting.

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:21.229
Bad experiences are quickly forgotten.

00:03:21.816 --> 00:03:25.259
Bad experiences quickly disappear.

00:03:26.005 --> 00:03:28.922
Which is why in this vast
and lonely cosmos,

00:03:28.946 --> 00:03:32.144
we are so wonderfully optimistic.

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:37.037
Our self-deception
becomes a positive illusion --

00:03:37.061 --> 00:03:41.790
why movies are able to take us
onto extraordinary adventures;

00:03:41.814 --> 00:03:45.592
why we believe Romeo
when he says he loves Juliet;

00:03:45.616 --> 00:03:48.324
and why single notes of music,

00:03:48.348 --> 00:03:50.666
when played together,

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:53.347
become a sonata and conjure up meaning.

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:55.528
That's "Clair De lune."

00:03:55.552 --> 00:03:58.169
Its composer, called Debussy,

00:03:58.193 --> 00:04:01.989
said that art was
the greatest deception of all.

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:08.324
Art is a deception
that creates real emotions --

00:04:08.348 --> 00:04:11.580
a lie that creates a truth.

00:04:11.967 --> 00:04:16.148
And when you give yourself
over to that deception,

00:04:16.172 --> 00:04:18.196
it becomes magic.

00:04:19.473 --> 00:04:20.902
[MAGIC]

00:04:23.596 --> 00:04:25.413
(Music fades slowly)

00:04:26.278 --> 00:04:28.763
(Applause)

00:04:38.968 --> 00:04:41.920
Thank you. Thank you very much.

00:04:41.944 --> 00:04:44.646
(Applause)
