00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
What I want to talk to you about

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
is what we can learn from studying the genomes

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
of living people

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
and extinct humans.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
But before doing that,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
I just briefly want to remind you about what you already know:

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
that our genomes, our genetic material,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
are stored in almost all cells in our bodies in chromosomes

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
in the form of DNA,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
which is this famous double-helical molecule.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
And the genetic information

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
is contained in the form of a sequence

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
of four bases

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
abbreviated with the letters A, T, C and G.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
And the information is there twice --

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
one on each strand --

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
which is important,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
because when new cells are formed, these strands come apart,

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
new strands are synthesized with the old ones as templates

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
in an almost perfect process.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
But nothing, of course, in nature

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
is totally perfect,

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
so sometimes an error is made

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
and a wrong letter is built in.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
And we can then see the result

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
of such mutations

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
when we compare DNA sequences

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
among us here in the room, for example.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
If we compare my genome to the genome of you,

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
approximately every 1,200, 1,300 letters

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
will differ between us.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
And these mutations accumulate

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
approximately as a function of time.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
So if we add in a chimpanzee here, we will see more differences.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
Approximately one letter in a hundred

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
will differ from a chimpanzee.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
And if you're then interested in the history

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
of a piece of DNA, or the whole genome,

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
you can reconstruct the history of the DNA

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
with those differences you observe.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000
And generally we depict our ideas about this history

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
in the form of trees like this.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
In this case, it's very simple.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
The two human DNA sequences

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
go back to a common ancestor quite recently.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.000
Farther back is there one shared with chimpanzees.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
And because these mutations

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
happen approximately as a function of time,

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
you can transform these differences

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
to estimates of time,

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
where the two humans, typically,

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000
will share a common ancestor about half a million years ago,

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
and with the chimpanzees,

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
it will be in the order of five million years ago.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
So what has now happened in the last few years

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
is that there are account technologies around

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.000
that allow you to see many, many pieces of DNA very quickly.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
So we can now, in a matter of hours,

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
determine a whole human genome.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
Each of us, of course, contains two human genomes --

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
one from our mothers and one from our fathers.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.000
And they are around three billion such letters long.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
And we will find that the two genomes in me,

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000
or one genome of mine we want to use,

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000
will have about three million differences

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
in the order of that.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
And what you can then also begin to do

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
is to say, "How are these genetic differences

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
distributed across the world?"

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
And if you do that,

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.000
you find a certain amount of genetic variation in Africa.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
And if you look outside Africa,

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
you actually find less genetic variation.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000
This is surprising, of course,

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000
because in the order of six to eight times fewer people

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000
live in Africa than outside Africa.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000
Yet the people inside Africa

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000
have more genetic variation.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
Moreover, almost all these genetic variants

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
we see outside Africa

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000
have closely related DNA sequences

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000
that you find inside Africa.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
But if you look in Africa,

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
there is a component of the genetic variation

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000
that has no close relatives outside.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000
So a model to explain this

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000
is that a part of the African variation, but not all of it,

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.000
[has] gone out and colonized the rest of the world.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:47.000
And together with the methods to date these genetic differences,

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000
this has led to the insight

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000
that modern humans --

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000
humans that are essentially indistinguishable from you and me --

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
evolved in Africa, quite recently,

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.000
between 100 and 200,000 years ago.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:05.000
And later, between 100 and 50,000 years ago or so,

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000
went out of Africa

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000
to colonize the rest of the world.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000
So what I often like to say

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000
is that, from a genomic perspective,

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000
we are all Africans.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000
We either live inside Africa today,

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000
or in quite recent exile.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000
Another consequence

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.000
of this recent origin of modern humans

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000
is that genetic variants

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000
are generally distributed widely in the world,

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000
in many places,

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.000
and they tend to vary as gradients,

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.000
from a bird's-eye perspective at least.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000
And since there are many genetic variants,

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.000
and they have different such gradients,

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.000
this means that if we determine a DNA sequence --

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.000
a genome from one individual --

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000
we can quite accurately estimate

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000
where that person comes from,

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000
provided that its parents or grandparents

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.000
haven't moved around too much.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000
But does this then mean,

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000
as many people tend to think,

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.000
that there are huge genetic differences between groups of people --

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000
on different continents, for example?

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.000
Well we can begin to ask those questions also.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.000
There is, for example, a project that's underway

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000
to sequence a thousand individuals --

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000
their genomes -- from different parts of the world.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.000
They've sequenced 185 Africans

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.000
from two populations in Africa.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.000
[They've] sequenced approximately equally [as] many people

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000
in Europe and in China.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000
And we can begin to say how much variance do we find,

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.000
how many letters that vary

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.000
in at least one of those individual sequences.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:43.000
And it's a lot: 38 million variable positions.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.000
But we can then ask: Are there any absolute differences

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.000
between Africans and non-Africans?

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000
Perhaps the biggest difference

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000
most of us would imagine existed.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.000
And with absolute difference --

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000
and I mean a difference

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.000
where people inside Africa at a certain position,

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.000
where all individuals -- 100 percent -- have one letter,

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:06.000
and everybody outside Africa has another letter.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.000
And the answer to that, among those millions of differences,

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.000
is that there is not a single such position.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.000
This may be surprising.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.000
Maybe a single individual is misclassified or so.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.000
So we can relax the criterion a bit

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.000
and say: How many positions do we find

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.000
where 95 percent of people in Africa have

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000
one variant,

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000
95 percent another variant,

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000
and the number of that is 12.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.000
So this is very surprising.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.000
It means that when we look at people

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.000
and see a person from Africa

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.000
and a person from Europe or Asia,

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:45.000
we cannot, for a single position in the genome with 100 percent accuracy,

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000
predict what the person would carry.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000
And only for 12 positions

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:53.000
can we hope to be 95 percent right.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000
This may be surprising,

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.000
because we can, of course, look at these people

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:01.000
and quite easily say where they or their ancestors came from.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.000
So what this means now

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.000
is that those traits we then look at

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.000
and so readily see --

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:10.000
facial features, skin color, hair structure --

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:14.000
are not determined by single genes with big effects,

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.000
but are determined by many different genetic variants

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.000
that seem to vary in frequency

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.000
between different parts of the world.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.000
There is another thing with those traits

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.000
that we so easily observe in each other

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000
that I think is worthwhile to consider,

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:32.000
and that is that, in a very literal sense,

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.000
they're really on the surface of our bodies.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.000
They are what we just said --

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:40.000
facial features, hair structure, skin color.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.000
There are also a number of features

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.000
that vary between continents like that

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:48.000
that have to do with how we metabolize food that we ingest,

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.000
or that have to do

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:53.000
with how our immune systems deal with microbes

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.000
that try to invade our bodies.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.000
But so those are all parts of our bodies

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:00.000
where we very directly interact with our environment,

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:04.000
in a direct confrontation, if you like.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.000
It's easy to imagine

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.000
how particularly those parts of our bodies

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:11.000
were quickly influenced by selection from the environment

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.000
and shifted frequencies of genes

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.000
that are involved in them.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.000
But if we look on other parts of our bodies

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.000
where we don't directly interact with the environment --

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:23.000
our kidneys, our livers, our hearts --

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.000
there is no way to say,

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.000
by just looking at these organs,

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:30.000
where in the world they would come from.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.000
So there's another interesting thing

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.000
that comes from this realization

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:40.000
that humans have a recent common origin in Africa,

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:43.000
and that is that when those humans emerged

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.000
around 100,000 years ago or so,

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.000
they were not alone on the planet.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:50.000
There were other forms of humans around,

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:53.000
most famously perhaps, Neanderthals --

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.000
these robust forms of humans,

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.000
compared to the left here

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:01.000
with a modern human skeleton on the right --

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:04.000
that existed in Western Asia and Europe

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.000
since several hundreds of thousands of years.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.000
So an interesting question is,

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.000
what happened when we met?

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.000
What happened to the Neanderthals?

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.000
And to begin to answer such questions,

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:18.000
my research group -- since over 25 years now --

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.000
works on methods to extract DNA

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.000
from remains of Neanderthals

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.000
and extinct animals

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:27.000
that are tens of thousands of years old.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:30.000
So this involves a lot of technical issues

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.000
in how you extract the DNA,

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:35.000
how you convert it to a form you can sequence.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.000
You have to work very carefully

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:40.000
to avoid contamination of experiments

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:43.000
with DNA from yourself.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:46.000
And this then, in conjunction with these methods

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:50.000
that allow very many DNA molecules to be sequenced very rapidly,

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.000
allowed us last year

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:55.000
to present the first version of the Neanderthal genome,

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.000
so that any one of you

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.000
can now look on the Internet, on the Neanderthal genome,

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:02.000
or at least on the 55 percent of it

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:05.000
that we've been able to reconstruct so far.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.000
And you can begin to compare it to the genomes

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:10.000
of people who live today.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.000
And one question

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.000
that you may then want to ask

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.000
is, what happened when we met?

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.000
Did we mix or not?

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.000
And the way to ask that question

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:23.000
is to look at the Neanderthal that comes from Southern Europe

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.000
and compare it to genomes

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.000
of people who live today.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.000
So we then look

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.000
to do this with pairs of individuals,

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:33.000
starting with two Africans,

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.000
looking at the two African genomes,

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:38.000
finding places where they differ from each other,

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:41.000
and in each case ask: What is a Neanderthal like?

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:44.000
Does it match one African or the other African?

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:47.000
We would expect there to be no difference,

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.000
because Neanderthals were never in Africa.

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:52.000
They should be equal, have no reason to be closer

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:55.000
to one African than another African.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.000
And that's indeed the case.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.000
Statistically speaking, there is no difference

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:03.000
in how often the Neanderthal matches one African or the other.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:05.000
But this is different

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:09.000
if we now look at the European individual and an African.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:12.000
Then, significantly more often,

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.000
does a Neanderthal match the European

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.000
rather than the African.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:19.000
The same is true if we look at a Chinese individual

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.000
versus an African,

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:25.000
the Neanderthal will match the Chinese individual more often.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.000
This may also be surprising

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.000
because the Neanderthals were never in China.

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:33.000
So the model we've proposed to explain this

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.000
is that when modern humans came out of Africa

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:38.000
sometime after 100,000 years ago,

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.000
they met Neanderthals.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:43.000
Presumably, they did so first in the Middle East,

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.000
where there were Neanderthals living.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:47.000
If they then mixed with each other there,

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.000
then those modern humans

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.000
that became the ancestors

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.000
of everyone outside Africa

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:56.000
carried with them this Neanderthal component in their genome

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.000
to the rest of the world.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:01.000
So that today, the people living outside Africa

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:04.000
have about two and a half percent of their DNA

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.000
from Neanderthals.

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:09.000
So having now a Neanderthal genome

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:11.000
on hand as a reference point

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.000
and having the technologies

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:15.000
to look at ancient remains

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:17.000
and extract the DNA,

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:21.000
we can begin to apply them elsewhere in the world.

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:24.000
And the first place we've done that is in Southern Siberia

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:26.000
in the Altai Mountains

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.000
at a place called Denisova,

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.000
a cave site in this mountain here,

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:33.000
where archeologists in 2008

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:35.000
found a tiny little piece of bone --

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:37.000
this is a copy of it --

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:41.000
that they realized came from the last phalanx

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:44.000
of a little finger of a pinky of a human.

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:46.000
And it was well enough preserved

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:49.000
so we could determine the DNA from this individual,

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:51.000
even to a greater extent

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.000
than for the Neanderthals actually,

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.000
and start relating it to the Neanderthal genome

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:58.000
and to people today.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.000
And we found that this individual

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:03.000
shared a common origin for his DNA sequences

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:07.000
with Neanderthals around 640,000 years ago.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:10.000
And further back, 800,000 years ago

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.000
is there a common origin

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.000
with present day humans.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.000
So this individual comes from a population

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:19.000
that shares an origin with Neanderthals,

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:22.000
but far back and then have a long independent history.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.000
We call this group of humans,

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.000
that we then described for the first time

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:28.000
from this tiny, tiny little piece of bone,

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.000
the Denisovans,

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:33.000
after this place where they were first described.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:36.000
So we can then ask for Denisovans

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.000
the same things as for the Neanderthals:

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:42.000
Did they mix with ancestors of present day people?

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.000
If we ask that question,

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:46.000
and compare the Denisovan genome

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.000
to people around the world,

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.000
we surprisingly find

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.000
no evidence of Denisovan DNA

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:57.000
in any people living even close to Siberia today.

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:59.000
But we do find it in Papua New Guinea

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:03.000
and in other islands in Melanesia and the Pacific.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:05.000
So this presumably means

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:08.000
that these Denisovans had been more widespread in the past,

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:11.000
since we don't think that the ancestors of Melanesians

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:13.000
were ever in Siberia.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:15.000
So from studying

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:18.000
these genomes of extinct humans,

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:21.000
we're beginning to arrive at a picture of what the world looked like

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:24.000
when modern humans started coming out of Africa.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:27.000
In the West, there were Neanderthals;

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:29.000
in the East, there were Denisovans --

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:31.000
maybe other forms of humans too

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:33.000
that we've not yet described.

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:36.000
We don't know quite where the borders between these people were,

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:38.000
but we know that in Southern Siberia,

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:40.000
there were both Neanderthals and Denisovans

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:43.000
at least at some time in the past.

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:46.000
Then modern humans emerged somewhere in Africa,

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:49.000
came out of Africa, presumably in the Middle East.

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:52.000
They meet Neanderthals, mix with them,

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:55.000
continue to spread over the world,

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:58.000
and somewhere in Southeast Asia,

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:00.000
they meet Denisovans and mix with them

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:03.000
and continue on out into the Pacific.

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:06.000
And then these earlier forms of humans disappear,

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:09.000
but they live on a little bit today

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:11.000
in some of us --

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:14.000
in that people outside of Africa have two and a half percent of their DNA

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:16.000
from Neanderthals,

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:18.000
and people in Melanesia

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:21.000
actually have an additional five percent approximately

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:24.000
from the Denisovans.

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:26.000
Does this then mean that there is after all

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:28.000
some absolute difference

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:31.000
between people outside Africa and inside Africa

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:33.000
in that people outside Africa

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:35.000
have this old component in their genome

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:37.000
from these extinct forms of humans,

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:39.000
whereas Africans do not?

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:42.000
Well I don't think that is the case.

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:44.000
Presumably, modern humans

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:46.000
emerged somewhere in Africa.

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:49.000
They spread across Africa also, of course,

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:52.000
and there were older, earlier forms of humans there.

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:54.000
And since we mixed elsewhere,

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:56.000
I'm pretty sure that one day,

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:58.000
when we will perhaps have a genome

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:00.000
of also these earlier forms in Africa,

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:02.000
we will find that they have also mixed

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:05.000
with early modern humans in Africa.

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:08.000
So to sum up,

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:10.000
what have we learned from studying genomes

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:12.000
of present day humans

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:14.000
and extinct humans?

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:16.000
We learn perhaps many things,

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:21.000
but one thing that I find sort of important to mention

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:24.000
is that I think the lesson is that we have always mixed.

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:26.000
We mixed with these earlier forms of humans,

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:28.000
wherever we met them,

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:32.000
and we mixed with each other ever since.

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:34.000
Thank you for your attention.

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:40.000
