WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
I'm a filmmaker.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
For the last 8 years,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
I have dedicated my life

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
to documenting the work

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
of Israelis and Palestinians

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
who are trying to end the conflict

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
using peaceful means.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
When I travel with my work

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
across Europe and the United States,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
one question always comes up:

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Where is the Palestinian Gandhi?

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Why aren't Palestinians

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
using nonviolent resistance?

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
The challenge I face when I hear this question

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
is that often I have just returned from the Middle East

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
where I spent my time

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
filming dozens of Palestinians

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
who are using nonviolence

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
to defend their lands

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
and water resources

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
from Israeli soldiers and settlers.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
These leaders are trying to forge

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
a massive national nonviolent movement

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
to end the occupation

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
and build peace in the region.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
Yet, most of you

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
have probably never heard about them.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
This divide between what's happening on the ground

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
and perceptions abroad

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
is one of the key reasons

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
why we don't have yet

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
a Palestinian peaceful resistance movement

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
that has been successful.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
So I'm here today

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
to talk about the power of attention,

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
the power of your attention,

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
and the emergence and development

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
of nonviolent movements

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
in the West Bank, Gaza and elsewhere --

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000
but today, my case study is going to be Palestine.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
I believe that what's mostly missing

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
for nonviolence to grow

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
is not for Palestinians

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
to start adopting nonviolence,

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
but for us to start paying attention

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
to those who already are.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
Allow me to illustrate this point

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
by taking you to this village

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
called Budrus.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
About seven years ago,

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
they faced extinction,

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
because Israel announced it would build a separation barrier,

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
and part of this barrier

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
would be built on top of the village.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
They would lose 40 percent of their land

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
and be surrounded,

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
so they would lose free access

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
to the rest of the West Bank.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
Through inspired local leadership,

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
they launched a peaceful resistance campaign

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
to stop that from happening.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
Let me show you some brief clips,

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
so you have a sense

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
for what that actually looked like on the ground.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.000
(Music)

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
Palestinian Woman: We were told the wall

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
would separate Palestine from Israel.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
Here in Budrus,

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
we realized the wall would steal our land.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
Israeli Man: The fence has, in fact,

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
created a solution to terror.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
Man: Today you're invited

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.000
to a peaceful march.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
You are joined

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000
by dozens of your Israeli brothers and sisters.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000
Israeli Activist: Nothing scares the army

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
more than nonviolent opposition.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
Woman: We saw the men

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
trying to push the soldiers,

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000
but none of them could do that.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000
But I think the girls could do it.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
Fatah Party Member: We must empty our minds

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
of traditional thinking.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000
Hamas Party Member: We were in complete harmony,

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.000
and we wanted to spread it to all of Palestine.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000
Chanting: One united nation.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.000
Fatah, Hamas and the Popular Front!

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000
News Anchor: The clashes over the fence continue.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.000
Reporter: Israeli border police were sent to disperse the crowd.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000
They were allowed to use any force necessary.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000
(Gunshots)

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
Man: These are live bullets.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.000
It's like Fallujah. Shooting everywhere.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.000
Israeli Activist: I was sure we were all going to die.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:09.000
But there were others around me who weren't even cowering.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000
Israeli Soldier: A nonviolent protest

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000
is not going to stop the [unclear].

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000
Protester: This is a peaceful march.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.000
There is no need to use violence.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:27.000
Chanting: We can do it! We can do it!

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000
We can do it!

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000
Julia Bacha: When I first heard

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000
about the story of Budrus,

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000
I was surprised

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.000
that the international media had failed to cover

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000
the extraordinary set of events

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000
that happened seven years ago,

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000
in 2003.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000
What was even more surprising

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.000
was the fact that Budrus was successful.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000
The residents, after 10 months of peaceful resistance,

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000
convinced the Israeli government

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000
to move the route of the barrier off their lands

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000
and to the green line,

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.000
which is the internationally recognized boundary

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.000
between Israel and the Palestinian Territories.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000
The resistance in Budrus

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000
has since spread

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000
to villages across the West Bank

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.000
and to Palestinian neighborhoods in Jerusalem.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.000
Yet the media remains mostly silent

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.000
on these stories.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.000
This silence carries profound consequences

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000
for the likelihood

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000
that nonviolence can grow,

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.000
or even survive,

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.000
in Palestine.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000
Violent resistance

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000
and nonviolent resistance

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:43.000
share one very important thing in common;

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.000
they are both a form of theater

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.000
seeking an audience to their cause.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000
If violent actors

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.000
are the only ones constantly getting front-page covers

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000
and attracting international attention

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000
to the Palestinian issue,

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000
it becomes very hard

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000
for nonviolent leaders

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.000
to make the case to their communities

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.000
that civil disobedience

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000
is a viable option

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000
in addressing their plight.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000
The power of attention

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000
is probably going to come as no surprise

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.000
to the parents in the room.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.000
The surest way

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.000
to make your child throw increasingly louder tantrums

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000
is by giving him attention

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000
the first time he throws a fit.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000
The tantrum will become

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000
what childhood psychologists call

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000
a functional behavior,

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000
since the child has learned

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.000
that he can get parental attention out of it.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:42.000
Parents can incentivize or disincentivize behavior

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000
simply by giving or withdrawing

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.000
attention to their children.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.000
But that's true for adults too.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.000
In fact, the behavior

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000
of entire communities and countries

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000
can be influenced,

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.000
depending on where

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000
the international community chooses

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.000
to focus its attention.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:07.000
I believe that at the core of ending the conflict in the Middle East

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000
and bringing peace

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000
is for us

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.000
to transform nonviolence

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000
into a functional behavior

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.000
by giving a lot more attention

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.000
to the nonviolent leaders on the ground today.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.000
In the course of taking my film to villages

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.000
in the West Bank, in Gaza and in East Jerusalem,

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000
I have seen the impact

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:32.000
that even one documentary film can have

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:36.000
in influencing the transformation.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.000
In a village called Wallajeh,

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:41.000
which sits very close to Jerusalem,

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.000
the community was facing

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.000
a very similar plight to Budrus.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.000
They were going to be surrounded, lose a lot of their lands

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.000
and not have freedom of access,

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:53.000
either to the West Bank or Jerusalem.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:56.000
They had been using nonviolence for about two years

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.000
but had grown disenchanted

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:01.000
since nobody was paying attention.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:04.000
So we organized a screening.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.000
A week later,

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.000
they held the most well-attended

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.000
and disciplined

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:13.000
demonstration to date.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.000
The organizers say

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.000
that the villagers, upon seeing the story of Budrus

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.000
documented in a film,

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.000
felt that there were indeed people

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.000
following what they were doing,

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.000
that people cared.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.000
So they kept on going.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.000
On the Israeli side,

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:32.000
there is a new peace movement called Solidariot,

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:35.000
which means solidarity in Hebrew.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:38.000
The leaders of this movement have been using Budrus

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:41.000
as one of their primary recruiting tools.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.000
They report

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.000
that Israelis who had never been active before,

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.000
upon seeing the film,

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.000
understand the power of nonviolence

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000
and start joining their activities.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.000
The examples of Wallajeh

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.000
and the Solidariot movement

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:59.000
show that even a small-budget independent film

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.000
can play a role

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.000
in transforming nonviolence

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:06.000
into a functional behavior.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.000
Now imagine the power

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:11.000
that big media players could have

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.000
if they started covering

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.000
the weekly nonviolent demonstrations

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.000
happening in villages

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.000
like Bil'in, Ni'lin,

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.000
Wallajeh,

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.000
in Jerusalem neighborhoods

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:26.000
like Sheikh Jarrah and Silwan --

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.000
the nonviolent leaders

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.000
would become more visible,

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.000
valued and effective

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:35.000
in their work.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.000
I believe

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.000
that the most important thing

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.000
is to understand

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:44.000
that if we don't pay attention to these efforts,

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.000
they are invisible,

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.000
and it's as if they never happened.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.000
But I have seen first hand

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.000
that if we do,

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.000
they will multiply.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.000
If they multiply,

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.000
their influence will grow

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.000
in the overall Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.000
And theirs is the kind of influence

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.000
that can finally

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.000
unblock the situation.

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:10.000
These leaders have proven that nonviolence works

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.000
in places like Budrus.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.000
Let's give them attention

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:17.000
so they can prove it works everywhere.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.000
Thank you.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:30.000
(Applause)
