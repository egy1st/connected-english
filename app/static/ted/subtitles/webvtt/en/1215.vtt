00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Today I'd like to show you

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
the future of the way we make things.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
I believe that soon our buildings and machines

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
will be self-assembling,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
replicating and repairing themselves.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
So I'm going to show you

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
what I believe is the current state of manufacturing,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
and then compare that to some natural systems.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
So in the current state of manufacturing, we have skyscrapers --

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
two and a half years [of assembly time],

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
500,000 to a million parts,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
fairly complex,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
new, exciting technologies in steel, concrete, glass.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
We have exciting machines

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
that can take us into space --

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
five years [of assembly time], 2.5 million parts.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
But on the other side, if you look at the natural systems,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
we have proteins

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
that have two million types,

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
can fold in 10,000 nanoseconds,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
or DNA with three billion base pairs

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
we can replicate in roughly an hour.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
So there's all of this complexity

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
in our natural systems,

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
but they're extremely efficient,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
far more efficient than anything we can build,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
far more complex than anything we can build.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
They're far more efficient in terms of energy.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
They hardly ever make mistakes.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
And they can repair themselves for longevity.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
So there's something super interesting about natural systems.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
And if we can translate that

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
into our built environment,

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
then there's some exciting potential for the way that we build things.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
And I think the key to that is self-assembly.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
So if we want to utilize self-assembly in our physical environment,

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
I think there's four key factors.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
The first is that we need to decode

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
all of the complexity of what we want to build --

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
so our buildings and machines.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
And we need to decode that into simple sequences --

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
basically the DNA of how our buildings work.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
Then we need programmable parts

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
that can take that sequence

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
and use that to fold up, or reconfigure.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
We need some energy that's going to allow that to activate,

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
allow our parts to be able to fold up from the program.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
And we need some type of error correction redundancy

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000
to guarantee that we have successfully built what we want.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
So I'm going to show you a number of projects

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
that my colleagues and I at MIT are working on

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
to achieve this self-assembling future.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
The first two are the MacroBot and DeciBot.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.000
So these projects are large-scale reconfigurable robots --

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000
8 ft., 12 ft. long proteins.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000
They're embedded with mechanical electrical devices, sensors.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
You decode what you want to fold up into,

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
into a sequence of angles --

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
so negative 120, negative 120, 0, 0,

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000
120, negative 120 -- something like that;

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
so a sequence of angles, or turns,

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000
and you send that sequence through the string.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000
Each unit takes its message -- so negative 120 --

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
it rotates to that, checks if it got there

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
and then passes it to its neighbor.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
So these are the brilliant scientists,

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
engineers, designers that worked on this project.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
And I think it really brings to light:

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
Is this really scalable?

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
I mean, thousands of dollars, lots of man hours

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000
made to make this eight-foot robot.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000
Can we really scale this up? Can we really embed robotics into every part?

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
The next one questions that

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
and looks at passive nature,

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000
or passively trying to have reconfiguration programmability.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
But it goes a step further,

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
and it tries to have actual computation.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
It basically embeds the most fundamental building block of computing,

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
the digital logic gate,

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
directly into your parts.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
So this is a NAND gate.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
You have one tetrahedron which is the gate

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000
that's going to do your computing,

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
and you have two input tetrahedrons.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000
One of them is the input from the user, as you're building your bricks.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000
The other one is from the previous brick that was placed.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.000
And then it gives you an output in 3D space.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000
So what this means

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.000
is that the user can start plugging in what they want the bricks to do.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
It computes on what it was doing before

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
and what you said you wanted it to do.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000
And now it starts moving in three-dimensional space --

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000
so up or down.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000
So on the left-hand side, [1,1] input equals 0 output, which goes down.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000
On the right-hand side,

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.000
[0,0] input is a 1 output, which goes up.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000
And so what that really means

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000
is that our structures now contain the blueprints

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000
of what we want to build.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.000
So they have all of the information embedded in them of what was constructed.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.000
So that means that we can have some form of self-replication.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.000
In this case I call it self-guided replication,

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
because your structure contains the exact blueprints.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000
If you have errors, you can replace a part.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000
All the local information is embedded to tell you how to fix it.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000
So you could have something that climbs along and reads it

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000
and can output at one to one.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000
It's directly embedded; there's no external instructions.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000
So the last project I'll show is called Biased Chains,

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000
and it's probably the most exciting example that we have right now

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000
of passive self-assembly systems.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000
So it takes the reconfigurability

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000
and programmability

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000
and makes it a completely passive system.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
So basically you have a chain of elements.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
Each element is completely identical,

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000
and they're biased.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.000
So each chain, or each element, wants to turn right or left.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.000
So as you assemble the chain, you're basically programming it.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.000
You're telling each unit if it should turn right or left.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.000
So when you shake the chain,

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000
it then folds up

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.000
into any configuration that you've programmed in --

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000
so in this case, a spiral,

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.000
or in this case,

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.000
two cubes next to each other.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000
So you can basically program

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000
any three-dimensional shape --

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000
or one-dimensional, two-dimensional -- up into this chain completely passively.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000
So what does this tell us about the future?

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000
I think that it's telling us

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.000
that there's new possibilities for self-assembly, replication, repair

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.000
in our physical structures, our buildings, machines.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000
There's new programmability in these parts.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000
And from that you have new possibilities for computing.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000
We'll have spatial computing.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000
Imagine if our buildings, our bridges, machines,

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000
all of our bricks could actually compute.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000
That's amazing parallel and distributed computing power,

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000
new design possibilities.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000
So it's exciting potential for this.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.000
So I think these projects I've showed here

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000
are just a tiny step towards this future,

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.000
if we implement these new technologies

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000
for a new self-assembling world.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000
Thank you.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.000
(Applause)
