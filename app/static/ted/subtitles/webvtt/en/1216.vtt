00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
I want to address the issue of compassion.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Compassion has many faces.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Some of them are fierce; some of them are wrathful;

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
some of them are tender; some of them are wise.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
A line that the Dalai Lama once said,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
he said, "Love and compassion are necessities.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
They are not luxuries.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Without them,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
humanity cannot survive."

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
And I would suggest,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
it is not only humanity that won't survive,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
but it is all species on the planet,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
as we've heard today.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
It is the big cats,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
and it's the plankton.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Two weeks ago, I was in Bangalore in India.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
I was so privileged

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
to be able to teach in a hospice

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
on the outskirts of Bangalore.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
And early in the morning,

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
I went into the ward.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
In that hospice,

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
there were 31 men and women

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
who were actively dying.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
And I walked up to the bedside

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
of an old woman

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
who was breathing very rapidly, fragile,

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
obviously in the latter phase

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
of active dying.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
I looked into her face.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
I looked into the face

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
of her son sitting next to her,

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
and his face was just riven

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
with grief and confusion.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
And I remembered

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
a line from the Mahabharata,

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
the great Indian epic:

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.000
"What is the most wondrous thing in the world, Yudhisthira?"

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
And Yudhisthira replied,

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
"The most wondrous thing in the world

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
is that all around us

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
people can be dying

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
and we don't realize

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
it can happen to us."

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
I looked up.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
Tending those 31 dying people

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
were young women

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
from villages around Bangalore.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
I looked into the face of one of these women,

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
and I saw in her face

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
the strength that arises

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000
when natural compassion is really present.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
I watched her hands

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.000
as she bathed an old man.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.000
My gaze went to another young woman

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
as she wiped the face

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
of another dying person.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
And it reminded me

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
of something that I had just been present for.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
Every year or so,

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
I have the privilege of taking clinicians

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000
into the Himalayas and the Tibetan Plateau.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
And we run clinics

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
in these very remote regions

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000
where there's no medical care whatsoever.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.000
And on the first day at Simikot in Humla,

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
far west of Nepal,

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000
the most impoverished region of Nepal,

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
an old man came in

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000
clutching a bundle of rags.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000
And he walked in, and somebody said something to him,

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000
we realized he was deaf,

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
and we looked into the rags,

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000
and there was this pair of eyes.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
The rags were unwrapped

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
from a little girl

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000
whose body was massively burned.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
Again,

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
the eyes and hands

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
of Avalokiteshvara.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000
It was the young women, the health aids,

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000
who cleaned the wounds of this baby

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000
and dressed the wounds.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000
I know those hands and eyes;

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000
they touched me as well.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000
They touched me at that time.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.000
They have touched me throughout my 68 years.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000
They touched me when I was four

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000
and I lost my eyesight

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000
and was partially paralyzed.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000
And my family brought in

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
a woman whose mother had been a slave

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.000
to take care of me.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000
And that woman

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000
did not have sentimental compassion.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000
She had phenomenal strength.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000
And it was really her strength, I believe,

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.000
that became the kind of mudra and imprimatur

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.000
that has been a guiding light in my life.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.000
So we can ask:

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:25.000
What is compassion comprised of?

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000
And there are various facets.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000
And there's referential and non-referential compassion.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
But first, compassion is comprised

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000
of that capacity

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000
to see clearly

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000
into the nature of suffering.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000
It is that ability

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000
to really stand strong

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000
and to recognize also

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000
that I'm not separate from this suffering.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000
But that is not enough,

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000
because compassion,

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
which activates the motor cortex,

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.000
means that we aspire,

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.000
we actually aspire to transform suffering.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000
And if we're so blessed,

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000
we engage in activities

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000
that transform suffering.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000
But compassion has another component,

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000
and that component is really essential.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000
That component

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.000
is that we cannot be attached to outcome.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.000
Now I worked with dying people

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.000
for over 40 years.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.000
I had the privilege of working on death row

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.000
in a maximum security [prison] for six years.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000
And I realized so clearly

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000
in bringing my own life experience,

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000
from working with dying people

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.000
and training caregivers,

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000
that any attachment to outcome

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000
would distort deeply

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.000
my own capacity to be fully present

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.000
to the whole catastrophe.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000
And when I worked in the prison system,

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.000
it was so clear to me, this:

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000
that many of us

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.000
in this room,

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.000
and almost all of the men that I worked with on death row,

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.000
the seeds of their own compassion had never been watered.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000
That compassion is actually

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.000
an inherent human quality.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.000
It is there within every human being.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000
But the conditions

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:14.000
for compassion to be activated,

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.000
to be aroused,

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.000
are particular conditions.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.000
I had that condition, to a certain extent,

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.000
from my own childhood illness.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.000
Eve Ensler, whom you'll hear later,

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000
has had that condition activated

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.000
amazingly in her

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:34.000
through the various waters of suffering

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.000
that she has been through.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000
And what is fascinating

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.000
is that compassion has enemies,

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:47.000
and those enemies are things like pity,

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.000
moral outrage,

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.000
fear.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:55.000
And you know, we have a society, a world,

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.000
that is paralyzed by fear.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000
And in that paralysis, of course,

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000
our capacity for compassion

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000
is also paralyzed.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.000
The very word terror

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.000
is global.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:11.000
The very feeling of terror is global.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.000
So our work, in a certain way,

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000
is to address this imago,

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.000
this kind of archetype

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.000
that has pervaded the psyche

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:22.000
of our entire globe.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:26.000
Now we know from neuroscience

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.000
that compassion has

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000
some very extraordinary qualities.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000
For example:

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.000
A person who is cultivating compassion,

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.000
when they are in the presence of suffering,

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:41.000
they feel that suffering a lot more

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.000
than many other people do.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.000
However,

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.000
they return to baseline a lot sooner.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.000
This is called resilience.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:53.000
Many of us think that compassion drains us,

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.000
but I promise you

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:58.000
it is something that truly enlivens us.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000
Another thing about compassion

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.000
is that it really enhances what's called neural integration.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.000
It hooks up all parts of the brain.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.000
Another, which has been discovered

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.000
by various researchers

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:14.000
at Emory and at Davis and so on,

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:18.000
is that compassion enhances our immune system.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.000
Hey,

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.000
we live in a very noxious world.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.000
(Laughter)

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.000
Most of us are shrinking

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:30.000
in the face of psycho-social and physical poisons,

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.000
of the toxins of our world.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.000
But compassion, the generation of compassion,

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:38.000
actually mobilizes

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:41.000
our immunity.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:44.000
You know, if compassion is so good for us,

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000
I have a question.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000
Why don't we train our children

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:53.000
in compassion?

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:58.000
(Applause)

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:01.000
If compassion is so good for us,

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:05.000
why don't we train our health care providers in compassion

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:08.000
so that they can do what they're supposed to do,

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:11.000
which is to really transform suffering?

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:14.000
And if compassion is so good for us,

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:18.000
why don't we vote on compassion?

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:22.000
Why don't we vote for people in our government

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.000
based on compassion,

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.000
so that we can have

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:29.000
a more caring world?

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.000
In Buddhism,

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:34.000
we say, "it takes a strong back and a soft front."

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:37.000
It takes tremendous strength of the back

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:40.000
to uphold yourself in the midst of conditions.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:43.000
And that is the mental quality of equanimity.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:46.000
But it also takes a soft front --

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:49.000
the capacity to really be open to the world as it is,

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.000
to have an undefended heart.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:54.000
And the archetype of this in Buddhism

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.000
is Avalokiteshvara, Kuan-Yin.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:59.000
It's a female archetype:

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.000
she who perceives

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:05.000
the cries of suffering in the world.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:12.000
She stands with 10,000 arms,

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.000
and in every hand,

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:17.000
there is an instrument of liberation,

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:20.000
and in the palm of every hand, there are eyes,

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:23.000
and these are the eyes of wisdom.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:26.000
I say that, for thousands of years,

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.000
women have lived,

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:32.000
exemplified, met in intimacy,

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:35.000
the archetype of Avalokitesvara,

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.000
of Kuan-Yin,

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.000
she who perceives

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.000
the cries of suffering in the world.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:45.000
Women have manifested for thousands of years

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:49.000
the strength arising from compassion

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:52.000
in an unfiltered, unmediated way

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:54.000
in perceiving suffering

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.000
as it is.

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:01.000
They have infused societies with kindness,

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:03.000
and we have really felt that

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:05.000
as woman after woman

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:07.000
has stood on this stage

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:10.000
in the past day and a half.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.000
And they have actualized compassion

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.000
through direct action.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.000
Jody Williams called it:

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.000
It's good to meditate.

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:21.000
I'm sorry, you've got to do a little bit of that, Jody.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:24.000
Step back, give your mother a break, okay.

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.000
(Laughter)

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.000
But the other side of the equation

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.000
is you've got to come out of your cave.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.000
You have to come into the world

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.000
like Asanga did,

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:37.000
who was looking to realize Maitreya Buddha

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:40.000
after 12 years sitting in the cave.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:42.000
He said, "I'm out of here."

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:44.000
He's going down the path.

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:46.000
He sees something in the path.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:49.000
He looks, it's a dog, he drops to his knees.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:53.000
He sees that the dog has this big wound on its leg.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:56.000
The wound is just filled with maggots.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:59.000
He puts out his tongue

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.000
in order to remove the maggots,

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:04.000
so as not to harm them.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.000
And at that moment,

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.000
the dog transformed

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:11.000
into the Buddha of love and kindness.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.000
I believe

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.000
that women and girls today

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:20.000
have to partner in a powerful way with men --

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.000
with their fathers,

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:25.000
with their sons, with their brothers,

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.000
with the plumbers, the road builders,

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:30.000
the caregivers, the doctors, the lawyers,

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.000
with our president,

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.000
and with all beings.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.000
The women in this room

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:39.000
are lotuses in a sea of fire.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:41.000
May we actualize that capacity

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.000
for women everywhere.

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:45.000
Thank you.

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:57.000
(Applause)
