00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
What I'm going to try and do in the next 15 minutes or so

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
is tell you about an idea

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
of how we're going to make matter come alive.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Now this may seem a bit ambitious,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
but when you look at yourself, you look at your hands,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
you realize that you're alive.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
So this is a start.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Now this quest started four billion years ago on planet Earth.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
There's been four billion years

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
of organic, biological life.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
And as an inorganic chemist,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
my friends and colleagues make this distinction

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
between the organic, living world

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
and the inorganic, dead world.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
And what I'm going to try and do is plant some ideas

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
about how we can transform inorganic, dead matter

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
into living matter, into inorganic biology.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
Before we do that,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
I want to kind of put biology in its place.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
And I'm absolutely enthralled by biology.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
I love to do synthetic biology.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
I love things that are alive.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
I love manipulating the infrastructure of biology.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
But within that infrastructure,

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
we have to remember

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
that the driving force of biology

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
is really coming from evolution.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
And evolution,

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
although it was established well over 100 years ago by Charles Darwin

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
and a vast number of other people,

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
evolution still is a little bit intangible.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
And when I talk about Darwinian evolution,

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
I mean one thing and one thing only,

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
and that is survival of the fittest.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
And so forget about evolution

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
in a kind of metaphysical way.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
Think about evolution

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
in terms of offspring competing,

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
and some winning.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
So bearing that in mind,

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
as a chemist, I wanted to ask myself

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
the question frustrated by biology:

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
What is the minimal unit of matter

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
that can undergo Darwinian evolution?

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
And this seems quite a profound question.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
And as a chemist,

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
we're not used to profound questions every day.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
So when I thought about it,

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
then suddenly I realized

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
that biology gave us the answer.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
And in fact, the smallest unit of matter

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
that can evolve independently

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
is, in fact, a single cell --

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
a bacteria.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
So this raises three really important questions:

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
What is life?

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
Is biology special?

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
Biologists seem to think so.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
Is matter evolvable?

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
Now if we answer those questions in reverse order,

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
the third question -- is matter evolvable? --

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
if we can answer that,

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
then we're going to know how special biology is,

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
and maybe, just maybe,

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
we'll have some idea of what life really is.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
So here's some inorganic life.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
This is a dead crystal,

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
and I'm going to do something to it,

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
and it's going to become alive.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
And you can see,

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
it's kind of pollinating, germinating, growing.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
This is an inorganic tube.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
And all these crystals here under the microscope

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
were dead a few minutes ago, and they look alive.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
Of course, they're not alive.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000
It's a chemistry experiment where I've made a crystal garden.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000
But when I saw this, I was really fascinated,

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
because it seemed lifelike.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000
And as I pause for a few seconds, have a look at the screen.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
You can see there's architecture growing, filling the void.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000
And this is dead.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000
So I was positive that,

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
if somehow we can make things mimic life,

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
let's go one step further.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000
Let's see if we can actually make life.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
But there's a problem,

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
because up until maybe a decade ago,

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
we were told that life was impossible

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000
and that we were the most incredible miracle in the universe.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
In fact, we were the only people

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
in the universe.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
Now, that's a bit boring.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
So as a chemist,

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
I wanted to say, "Hang on. What is going on here?

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000
Is life that improbable?"

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.000
And this is really the question.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.000
I think that perhaps the emergence of the first cells

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.000
was as probable as the emergence of the stars.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.000
And in fact, let's take that one step further.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000
Let's say

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000
that if the physics of fusion

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000
is encoded into the universe,

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000
maybe the physics of life is as well.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000
And so the problem with chemists --

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000
and this is a massive advantage as well --

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000
is we like to focus on our elements.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000
In biology, carbon takes center stage.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000
And in a universe where carbon exists

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000
and organic biology,

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.000
then we have all this wonderful diversity of life.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.000
In fact, we have such amazing lifeforms that we can manipulate.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000
We're awfully careful in the lab

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000
to try and avoid various biohazards.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000
Well what about matter?

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.000
If we can make matter alive, would we have a matterhazard?

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.000
So think, this is a serious question.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.000
If your pen could replicate,

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
that would be a bit of a problem.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
So we have to think differently

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000
if we're going to make stuff come alive.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000
And we also have to be aware of the issues.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000
But before we can make life,

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000
let's think for a second

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000
what life really is characterized by.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000
And forgive the complicated diagram.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.000
This is just a collection of pathways in the cell.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000
And the cell is obviously for us

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000
a fascinating thing.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000
Synthetic biologists are manipulating it.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000
Chemists are trying to study the molecules to look at disease.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000
And you have all these pathways going on at the same time.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000
You have regulation;

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000
information is transcribed;

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000
catalysts are made; stuff is happening.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000
But what does a cell do?

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000
Well it divides, it competes,

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000
it survives.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000
And I think that is where we have to start

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000
in terms of thinking about

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000
building from our ideas in life.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000
But what else is life characterized by?

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000
Well, I like think of it

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000
as a flame in a bottle.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000
And so what we have here

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000
is a description of single cells

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000
replicating, metabolizing,

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000
burning through chemistries.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.000
And so we have to understand

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.000
that if we're going to make artificial life or understand the origin of life,

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.000
we need to power it somehow.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.000
So before we can really start to make life,

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000
we have to really think about where it came from.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000
And Darwin himself mused in a letter to a colleague

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000
that he thought that life probably emerged

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.000
in some warm little pond somewhere --

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000
maybe not in Scotland, maybe in Africa,

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.000
maybe somewhere else.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.000
But the real honest answer is, we just don't know,

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.000
because there is a problem with the origin.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000
Imagine way back, four and a half billion years ago,

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000
there is a vast chemical soup of stuff.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000
And from this stuff we came.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.000
So when you think about the improbable nature

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000
of what I'm going to tell you in the next few minutes,

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000
just remember,

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.000
we came from stuff on planet Earth.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.000
And we went through a variety of worlds.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.000
The RNA people would talk about the RNA world.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000
We somehow got to proteins and DNA.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000
We then got to the last ancestor.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.000
Evolution kicked in -- and that's the cool bit.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000
And here we are.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:34.000
But there's a roadblock that you can't get past.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.000
You can decode the genome, you can look back,

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:40.000
you can link us all together by a mitochondrial DNA,

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:43.000
but we can't get further than the last ancestor,

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.000
the last visible cell

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.000
that we could sequence or think back in history.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.000
So we don't know how we got here.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000
So there are two options:

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000
intelligent design, direct and indirect --

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.000
so God,

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.000
or my friend.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.000
Now talking about E.T. putting us there, or some other life,

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.000
just pushes the problem further on.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.000
I'm not a politician, I'm a scientist.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000
The other thing we need to think about

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.000
is the emergence of chemical complexity.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000
This seems most likely.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.000
So we have some kind of primordial soup.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.000
And this one happens to be

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.000
a good source of all 20 amino acids.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.000
And somehow

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.000
these amino acids are combined,

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.000
and life begins.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000
But life begins, what does that mean?

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:32.000
What is life? What is this stuff of life?

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.000
So in the 1950s,

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:39.000
Miller-Urey did their fantastic chemical Frankenstein experiment,

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.000
where they did the equivalent in the chemical world.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:44.000
They took the basic ingredients, put them in a single jar

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.000
and ignited them

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.000
and put a lot of voltage through.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.000
And they had a look at what was in the soup,

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:53.000
and they found amino acids,

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.000
but nothing came out, there was no cell.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:58.000
So the whole area's been stuck for a while,

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:01.000
and it got reignited in the '80s

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:04.000
when analytical technologies and computer technologies were coming on.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.000
In my own laboratory,

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:09.000
the way we're trying to create inorganic life

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.000
is by using many different reaction formats.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.000
So what we're trying to do is do reactions --

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.000
not in one flask, but in tens of flasks,

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.000
and connect them together,

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.000
as you can see with this flow system, all these pipes.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:22.000
We can do it microfluidically, we can do it lithographically,

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.000
we can do it in a 3D printer,

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000
we can do it in droplets for colleagues.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:29.000
And the key thing is to have lots of complex chemistry

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000
just bubbling away.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:35.000
But that's probably going to end in failure,

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.000
so we need to be a bit more focused.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.000
And the answer, of course, lies with mice.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.000
This is how I remember what I need as a chemist.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.000
I say, "Well I want molecules."

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:47.000
But I need a metabolism, I need some energy.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:50.000
I need some information, and I need a container.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.000
Because if I want evolution,

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.000
I need containers to compete.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.000
So if you have a container,

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.000
it's like getting in your car.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.000
"This is my car,

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000
and I'm going to drive around and show off my car."

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000
And I imagine you have a similar thing

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.000
in cellular biology

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.000
with the emergence of life.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:11.000
So these things together give us evolution, perhaps.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.000
And the way to test it in the laboratory

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.000
is to make it minimal.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.000
So what we're going to try and do

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:20.000
is come up with an inorganic Lego kit of molecules.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.000
And so forgive the molecules on the screen,

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.000
but these are a very simple kit.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.000
There's only maybe three or four different types of building blocks present.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.000
And we can aggregate them together

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.000
and make literally thousands and thousands

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:33.000
of really big nano-molecular molecules

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.000
the same size of DNA and proteins,

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.000
but there's no carbon in sight.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.000
Carbon is banned.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.000
And so with this Lego kit,

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.000
we have the diversity required

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:46.000
for complex information storage

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.000
without DNA.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.000
But we need to make some containers.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.000
And just a few months ago in my lab,

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:55.000
we were able to take these very same molecules and make cells with them.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:58.000
And you can see on the screen a cell being made.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:01.000
And we're now going to put some chemistry inside and do some chemistry in this cell.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.000
And all I wanted to show you

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.000
is we can set up molecules

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.000
in membranes, in real cells,

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:11.000
and then it sets up a kind of molecular Darwinism,

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.000
a molecular survival of the fittest.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.000
And this movie here

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:17.000
shows this competition between molecules.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.000
Molecules are competing for stuff.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.000
They're all made of the same stuff,

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.000
but they want their shape to win.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.000
They want their shape to persist.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.000
And that is the key.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.000
If we can somehow encourage these molecules

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:32.000
to talk to each other and make the right shapes and compete,

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.000
they will start to form cells

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.000
that will replicate and compete.

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.000
If we manage to do that,

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:41.000
forget the molecular detail.

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.000
Let's zoom out to what that could mean.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.000
So we have this special theory of evolution

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:48.000
that applies only to organic biology, to us.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:51.000
If we could get evolution into the material world,

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:54.000
then I propose we should have a general theory of evolution.

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:57.000
And that's really worth thinking about.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.000
Does evolution control

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:02.000
the sophistication of matter in the universe?

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:05.000
Is there some driving force through evolution

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:07.000
that allows matter to compete?

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.000
So that means we could then start

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:12.000
to develop different platforms

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.000
for exploring this evolution.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.000
So you imagine,

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:19.000
if we're able to create a self-sustaining artificial life form,

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:22.000
not only will this tell us about the origin of life --

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:25.000
that it's possible that the universe doesn't need carbon to be alive;

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.000
it can use anything --

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:30.000
we can then take [it] one step further and develop new technologies,

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.000
because we can then use software control

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.000
for evolution to code in.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.000
So imagine we make a little cell.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.000
We want to put it out in the environment,

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.000
and we want it to be powered by the Sun.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:43.000
What we do is we evolve it in a box with a light on.

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:46.000
And we don't use design anymore. We find what works.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.000
We should take our inspiration from biology.

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.000
Biology doesn't care about the design

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.000
unless it works.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.000
So this will reorganize

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.000
the way we design things.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.000
But not only just that,

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.000
we will start to think about

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:03.000
how we can start to develop a symbiotic relationship with biology.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:05.000
Wouldn't it be great

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:07.000
if you could take these artificial biological cells

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:09.000
and fuse them with biological ones

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:12.000
to correct problems that we couldn't really deal with?

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.000
The real issue in cellular biology

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:17.000
is we are never going to understand everything,

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:20.000
because it's a multidimensional problem put there by evolution.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:23.000
Evolution cannot be cut apart.

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:26.000
You need to somehow find the fitness function.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.000
And the profound realization for me

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.000
is that, if this works,

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:33.000
the concept of the selfish gene gets kicked up a level,

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:36.000
and we really start talking about selfish matter.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.000
And what does that mean in a universe

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:41.000
where we are right now the highest form of stuff?

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.000
You're sitting on chairs.

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:45.000
They're inanimate, they're not alive.

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:47.000
But you are made of stuff, and you are using stuff,

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:49.000
and you enslave stuff.

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:51.000
So using evolution

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.000
in biology,

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.000
and in inorganic biology,

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.000
for me is quite appealing, quite exciting.

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:00.000
And we're really becoming very close

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.000
to understanding the key steps

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:05.000
that makes dead stuff come alive.

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:08.000
And again, when you're thinking about how improbable this is,

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:10.000
remember, five billion years ago,

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:13.000
we were not here, and there was no life.

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:15.000
So what will that tell us

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:18.000
about the origin of life and the meaning of life?

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:20.000
But perhaps, for me as a chemist,

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.000
I want to keep away from general terms;

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.000
I want to think about specifics.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.000
So what does it mean about defining life?

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:28.000
We really struggle to do this.

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.000
And I think, if we can make inorganic biology,

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:33.000
and we can make matter become evolvable,

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:35.000
that will in fact define life.

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:37.000
I propose to you

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:40.000
that matter that can evolve is alive,

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:43.000
and this gives us the idea of making evolvable matter.

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:45.000
Thank you very much.

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:52.000
(Applause)

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:56.000
Chris Anderson: Just a quick question on timeline.

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:58.000
You believe you're going to be successful in this project?

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:00.000
When?

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.000
Lee Cronin: So many people think

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.000
that life took millions of years to kick in.

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:07.000
We're proposing to do it in just a few hours,

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:09.000
once we've set up

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:11.000
the right chemistry.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:13.000
CA: And when do you think that will happen?

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:16.000
LC: Hopefully within the next two years.

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.000
CA: That would be a big story.

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:20.000
(Laughter)

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:22.000
In your own mind, what do you believe the chances are

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:24.000
that walking around on some other planet

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.000
is non-carbon-based life,

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.000
walking or oozing or something?

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.000
LC: I think it's 100 percent.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:33.000
Because the thing is, we are so chauvinistic to biology,

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:35.000
if you take away carbon, there's other things that can happen.

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:37.000
So the other thing

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.000
that if we were able to create life that's not based on carbon,

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:42.000
maybe we can tell NASA what really to look for.

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:45.000
Don't go and look for carbon, go and look for evolvable stuff.

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:47.000
CA: Lee Cronin, good luck. (LC: Thank you very much.)

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:49.000
(Applause)
