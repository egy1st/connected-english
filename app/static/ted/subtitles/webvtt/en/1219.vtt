00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Hi everyone.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
I'm an artist and a dad -- second time around.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Thank you.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
And I want to share with you my latest art project.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
It's a children's book for the iPad.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
It's a little quirky and silly.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
It's called "Pop-It,"

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
And it's about the things little kids do with their parents.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
(Music)

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
So this is about potty training --

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
as most of you, I hope, know.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
You can tickle the rug.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
You can make the baby poop.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
You can do all those fun things.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
You can burst bubbles.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
You can draw, as everyone should.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
But you know, I have a problem with children's books:

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
I think they're full of propaganda.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
At least an Indian trying to get one of these American books in Park Slope, forget it.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
It's not the way I was brought up.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
So I said, "I'm going to counter this with my own propaganda."

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
If you notice carefully,

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
it's a homosexual couple bringing up a child.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
You don't like it?

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
Shake it, and you have a lesbian couple.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
(Laughter)

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000
Shake it, and you have a heterosexual couple.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
You know, I don't even believe in the concept of an ideal family.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
I have to tell you about my childhood.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
I went to this very proper Christian school

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
taught by nuns, fathers, brothers, sisters.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
Basically, I was brought up to be a good Samaritan,

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
and I am.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
And I'd go at the end of the day to a traditional Hindu house,

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
which was probably the only Hindu house

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
in a predominantly Islamic neighborhood.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
Basically, I celebrated every religious function.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
In fact, when there was a wedding in our neighborhood,

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
all of us would paint our houses for the wedding.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
I remember we cried profusely

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
when the little goats we played with in the summer

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
became biriani.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
(Laughter)

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
We all had to fast during Ramadan.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
It was a very beautiful time.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
But I must say,

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
I'll never forget, when I was 13 years old, this happened.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
Babri Masjid --

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
one of the most beautiful mosques in India,

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
built by King Babur, I think, in the 16th century --

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
was demolished by Hindu activists.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
This caused major riots in my city.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
And for the first time,

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
I was affected

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
by this communal unrest.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
My little five-year-old kid neighbor

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
comes running in,

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
and he says, "Rags, Rags.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
You know the Hindus are killing us Muslims. Be careful."

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
I'm like, "Dude, I'm Hindu."

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.000
(Laughter)

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
He's like, "Huh!"

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
You know, my work is inspired

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
by events such as this.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000
Even in my gallery shows,

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
I try and revisit historic events

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
like Babri Masjid,

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
distill only its emotional residue

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
and image my own life.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
Imagine history being taught differently.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.000
Remember that children's book

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
where you shake and the sexuality of the parents change?

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.000
I have another idea.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000
It's a children's book about Indian independence --

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
very patriotic.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
But when you shake it, you get Pakistan's perspective.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000
Shake it again, and you get the British perspective.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:10.000
(Applause)

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000
You have to separate fact from bias, right.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
Even my books on children

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
have cute, fuzzy animals.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000
But they're playing geopolitics.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000
They're playing out Israel-Palestine,

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000
India-Pakistan.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
You know, I'm making a very important argument.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
And my argument [is]

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.000
that the only way for us to teach creativity

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
is by teaching children perspectives

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000
at the earliest stage.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000
After all, children's books are manuals on parenting,

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000
so you better give them children's books that teach them perspectives.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000
And conversely,

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000
only when you teach perspectives

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000
will a child be able to imagine

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000
and put themselves in the shoes

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000
of someone who is different from them.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000
I'm making an argument that art and creativity

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000
are very essential tools in empathy.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000
You know, I can't promise my child

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000
a life without bias --

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000
we're all biased --

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000
but I promise to bias my child with multiple perspectives.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000
Thank you very much.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:09.000
(Applause)
