00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
My topic

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
is economic growth in China and India.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
And the question I want to explore with you

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
is whether or not

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
democracy has helped or has hindered

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
economic growth.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
You may say this is not fair,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
because I'm selecting two countries

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
to make a case against democracy.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Actually, exactly the opposite

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
is what I'm going to do.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
I'm going to use these two countries

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
to make an economic argument for democracy,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
rather than against democracy.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
The first question there

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
is why China has grown so much faster

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
than India.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
Over the last 30 years,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
in terms of the GDP growth rates,

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000
China has grown at twice the rate of India.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
In the last five years,

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
the two countries have begun to converge somewhat

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
in economic growth.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
But over the last 30 years,

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
China undoubtedly

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
has done much better than India.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
One simple answer

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
is China has Shanghai and India has Mumbai.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
Look at the skyline of Shanghai.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
This is the Pudong area.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
The picture on India

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
is the Dharavi slum of Mumbai

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
in India.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
The idea there

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
behind these two pictures

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
is that the Chinese government

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
can act above rule of law.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
It can plan

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
for the long-term benefits of the country

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
and in the process,

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
evict millions of people --

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
that's just a small technical issue.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
Whereas in India, you cannot do that,

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
because you have to listen to the public.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
You're being constrained by the public's opinion.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
Even Prime Minister Manmohan Singh

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
agrees with that view.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
In an interview

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
printed in the financial press of India,

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000
He said that he wants to make Mumbai

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
another Shanghai.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
This is an Oxford-trained economist

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000
steeped in humanistic values,

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
and yet he agrees

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
with the high-pressure tactics of Shanghai.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000
So let me call it the Shanghai model of economic growth,

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.000
that emphasizes the following features

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
for promoting economic development:

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
infrastructures, airports,

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000
highways, bridges, things like that.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000
And you need a strong government to do that,

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000
because you cannot respect private property rights.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000
You cannot be constrained by the public's opinion.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
You need also state ownership,

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
especially of land assets,

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
in order to build and roll out infrastructures

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
very quickly.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
The implication of that model

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
is that democracy

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
is a hindrance for economic growth,

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.000
rather than a facilitator of economic growth.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
Here's the key question.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000
Just how important are infrastructures

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
for economic growth?

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
This is a key issue.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.000
If you believe that infrastructures are very important for economic growth,

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000
then you would argue a strong government is necessary

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
to promote growth.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
If you believe

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000
that infrastructures are not as important as many people believe,

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000
then you will put less emphasis

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
on strong government.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
So to illustrate that question,

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
let me give you two countries.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
And for the sake of brevity,

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
I'll call one country Country 1

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000
and the other country Country 2.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000
Country 1

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000
has a systematic advantage over Country 2

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000
in infrastructures.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.000
Country 1 has more telephones,

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000
and Country 1 has a longer system of railways.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.000
So if I were to ask you,

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000
"Which is China

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000
and which is India,

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000
and which country has grown faster?"

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.000
if you believe in the infrastructure view,

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.000
then you will say, "Country 1 must be China.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000
They must have done better, in terms of economic growth.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.000
And Country 2 is possibly India."

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.000
Actually the country with more telephones

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000
is the Soviet Union,

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.000
and the data referred to 1989.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:21.000
After the country reported very impressive statistics on telephones,

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000
the country collapsed.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000
That's not too good.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
The picture there is Khrushchev.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
I know that in 1989

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
he no longer ruled the Soviet Union,

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.000
but that's the best picture that I can find.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000
(Laughter)

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000
Telephones, infrastructures

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000
do not guarantee you economic growth.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.000
Country 2, that has fewer telephones,

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000
is China.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000
Since 1989,

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000
the country has performed at a double-digit rate

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.000
every year for the last 20 years.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.000
If you know nothing about China and the Soviet Union

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.000
other than the fact about their telephones,

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000
you would have made a poor prediction

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000
about their economic growth

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000
in the next two decades.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.000
Country 1, that has a longer system of railways,

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000
is actually India.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.000
And Country 2 is China.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.000
This is a very little known fact

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000
about the two countries.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000
Yes, today China has a huge infrastructure advantage

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000
over India.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000
But for many years,

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000
until the late 1990s,

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000
China had an infrastructure disadvantage

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000
vis-a-vis India.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000
In developing countries,

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.000
the most common mode of transportation

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000
is the railways,

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.000
and the British built a lot of railways in India.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.000
India is the smaller of the two countries,

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.000
and yet it had a longer system of railways

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.000
until the late 1990s.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000
So clearly,

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000
infrastructure doesn't explain

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.000
why China did better before the late 1990s,

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000
as compared with India.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:01.000
In fact, if you look at the evidence worldwide,

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.000
the evidence is more supportive of the view

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.000
that the infrastructure are actually the result of economic growth.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000
The economy grows,

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000
government accumulates more resources,

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.000
and the government can invest in infrastructure --

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.000
rather than infrastructure being a cause

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000
for economic growth.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000
And this is clearly the story

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.000
of the Chinese economic growth.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000
Let me look at this question more directly.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.000
Is democracy bad for economic growth?

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000
Now let's turn to two countries,

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.000
Country A and Country B.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.000
Country A, in 1990,

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:40.000
had about $300 per capita GDP

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000
as compared with Country B,

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.000
which had $460 in per capita GDP.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000
By 2008,

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.000
Country A has surpassed Country B

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.000
with $700 per capita GDP

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:57.000
as compared with $650 per capita GDP.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.000
Both countries are in Asia.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000
If I were to ask you,

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.000
"Which are the two Asian countries?

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.000
And which one is a democracy?"

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.000
you may argue,

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000
"Well, maybe Country A is China

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000
and Country B is India."

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.000
In fact, Country A

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000
is democratic India,

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.000
and Country B is Pakistan --

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.000
the country that has a long period

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.000
of military rule.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.000
And it's very common

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:28.000
that we compare India with China.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000
That's because the two countries

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.000
have about the same population size.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.000
But the more natural comparison

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.000
is actually between India and Pakistan.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:40.000
Those two countries are geographically similar.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:44.000
They have a complicated, but shared common history.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.000
By that comparison,

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.000
democracy looks very, very good

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:51.000
in terms of economic growth.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:54.000
So why do economists fall in love

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.000
with authoritarian governments?

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.000
One reason is the East Asian Model.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.000
In East Asia,

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:04.000
we have had successful economic growth stories

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.000
such as Korea, Taiwan,

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.000
Hong Kong and Singapore.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.000
Some of these economies

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000
were ruled by authoritarian governments

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.000
in the 60s and 70s

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.000
and 1980s.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.000
The problem with that view

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:21.000
is like asking all the winners of lotteries,

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:24.000
"Have you won the lottery?"

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000
And they all tell you, "Yes, we have won the lottery."

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000
And then you draw the conclusion

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.000
the odds of winning the lottery

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.000
are 100 percent.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.000
The reason is you never go

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.000
and bother to ask the losers

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.000
who also purchased lottery tickets

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:43.000
and didn't end up winning the prize.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:46.000
For each of these successful authoritarian governments

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.000
in East Asia,

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.000
there's a matched failure.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:54.000
Korea succeeded, North Korea didn't.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:57.000
Taiwan succeeded, China under Mao Zedong didn't.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.000
Burma didn't succeed.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.000
The Philippines didn't succeed.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:04.000
If you look at the statistical evidence worldwide,

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:07.000
there's really no support for the idea

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.000
that authoritarian governments

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.000
hold a systematic edge over democracies

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.000
in terms of economic growth.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.000
So the East Asian model

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.000
has this massive selection bias --

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:21.000
it is known as selecting on a dependent variable,

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:25.000
something we always tell our students to avoid.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:29.000
So exactly why did China grow so much faster?

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.000
I will take you to the Cultural Revolution,

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.000
when China went mad,

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:37.000
and compare that country's performance with India

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.000
under Indira Gandhi.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:42.000
The question there is: Which country did better,

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:44.000
China or India?

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.000
China was during the Cultural Revolution.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.000
It turns out even during the Cultural Revolution,

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.000
China out-perfomed India

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.000
in terms of GDP growth

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:55.000
by an average of about 2.2 percent every year

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:58.000
in terms of per capita GDP.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.000
So that's when China was mad.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.000
The whole country went mad.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.000
It must mean that the country

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:09.000
had something so advantageous to itself in terms of economic growth

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:12.000
to overcome the negative effects

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.000
of the Cultural Revolution.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.000
The advantage the country had

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:19.000
was human capital --

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.000
nothing else but human capital.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:25.000
This is the world development index indicator data

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.000
in the early 1990s.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:30.000
And this is the earliest data that I can find.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:33.000
The adult literacy rate in China

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.000
is 77 percent

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:38.000
as compared with 48 percent in India.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:41.000
The contrast in literacy rates

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.000
is especially sharp

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:46.000
between Chinese women and Indian women.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:50.000
I haven't told you about the definition of literacy.

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:53.000
In China, the definition of literacy

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.000
is the ability to read and write

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:58.000
1,500 Chinese characters.

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:01.000
In India, the definition of literacy,

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:03.000
operating definition of literacy,

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:06.000
is the ability, the grand ability,

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.000
to write your own name

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:12.000
in whatever language you happen to speak.

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.000
The gap between the two countries in terms of literacy

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.000
is much more substantial

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:19.000
than the data here indicated.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.000
If you go to other sources of data

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.000
such as Human Development Index,

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.000
that data series,

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:28.000
go back to the early 1970s,

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.000
you see exactly the same contrast.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.000
China held a huge advantage

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.000
in terms of human capital

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.000
vis-a-vis India.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.000
Life expectancies:

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.000
as early as 1965,

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:44.000
China had a huge advantage in life expectancy.

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:47.000
On average, as a Chinese in 1965,

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.000
you lived 10 years more

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.000
than an average Indian.

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.000
So if you have a choice

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.000
between being a Chinese and being an Indian,

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:57.000
you would want to become a Chinese

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:00.000
in order to live 10 years longer.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.000
If you made that decision in 1965,

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.000
the down side of that

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.000
is the next year we have the Cultural Revolution.

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:09.000
So you have to always think carefully

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:11.000
about these decisions.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:14.000
If you cannot chose your nationality,

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:17.000
then you will want to become an Indian man.

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:19.000
Because, as an Indian man,

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:22.000
you have about two years of life expectancy advantage

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:25.000
vis-a-vis Indian women.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:28.000
This is an extremely strange fact.

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:31.000
It's very rare among countries

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:33.000
to have this kind of pattern.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:36.000
It shows the systematic discrimination and biases

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.000
in the Indian society

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.000
against women.

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:42.000
The good news is, by 2006,

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:44.000
India has closed the gap

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:46.000
between men and women

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:49.000
in terms of life expectancy.

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:52.000
Today, Indian women have a sizable life expectancy edge

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.000
over Indian men.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:57.000
So India is reverting to the normal.

00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:59.000
But India still has a lot of work to do

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.000
in terms of gender equality.

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:03.000
These are the two pictures

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:06.000
taken of garment factories in Guangdong Province

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:09.000
and garment factories in India.

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:11.000
In China, it's all women.

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:14.000
60 to 80 percent of the workforce in China is women

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.000
in the coastal part of the country,

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:19.000
whereas in India, it's all men.

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:21.000
Financial Times printed this picture

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.000
of an Indian textile factory

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:27.000
with the title, "India Poised to Overtake China in Textile."

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:29.000
By looking at these two pictures,

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:33.000
I say no, it won't overtake China for a while.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:35.000
If you look at other East Asian countries,

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:39.000
women there play a hugely important role

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:41.000
in terms of economic take-off --

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:44.000
in terms of creating the manufacturing miracle

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:46.000
associated with East Asia.

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.000
India still has a long way to go

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.000
to catch up with China.

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.000
Then the issue is,

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:54.000
what about the Chinese political system?

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.000
You talk about human capital,

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:58.000
you talk about education and public health.

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:00.000
What about the political system?

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:03.000
Isn't it true that the one-party political system

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:07.000
has facilitated economic growth in China?

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:11.000
Actually, the answer is more nuanced and subtle than that.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:14.000
It depends on a distinction that you draw

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:17.000
between statics of the political system

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:19.000
and the dynamics of the political system.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:22.000
Statically, China is a one-party system,

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:25.000
authoritarian -- there's no question about it.

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:28.000
Dynamically, it has changed over time

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:31.000
to become less authoritarian and more democratic.

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:33.000
When you explain change --

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:35.000
for example, economic growth;

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:37.000
economic growth is about change --

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.000
when you explain change,

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:42.000
you use other things that have changed to explain change,

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:46.000
rather than using the constant to explain change.

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:49.000
Sometimes a fixed effect can explain change,

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:52.000
but a fixed effect only explains changes

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:55.000
in interaction with the things that change.

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:57.000
In terms of the political changes,

00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:59.000
they have introduced village elections.

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:03.000
They have increased the security of proprietors.

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:06.000
And they have increased the security

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:08.000
with long-term land leases.

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:11.000
There are also financial reforms in rural China.

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:14.000
There is also a rural entrepreneurial revolution in China.

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:17.000
To me, the pace of political changes

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:19.000
is too slow, too gradual.

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:21.000
And my own view is the country

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:23.000
is going to face some substantial challenges,

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:27.000
because they have not moved further and faster on political reforms.

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:29.000
But nevertheless,

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:32.000
the system has moved in a more liberal direction,

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:35.000
moved in a more democratic direction.

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:40.000
You can apply exactly the same dynamic perspective on India.

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:42.000
In fact, when India was growing

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:44.000
at a Hindu rate of growth --

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:46.000
about one percent, two percent a year --

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:49.000
that was when India was least democratic.

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:53.000
Indira Gandhi declared emergency rule in 1975.

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:56.000
The Indian government owned and operated

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:58.000
all the TV stations.

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:01.000
A little-known fact about India in the 1990s

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:03.000
is that the country

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:06.000
not only has undertaken economic reforms,

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:09.000
the country has also undertaken political reforms

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:12.000
by introducing village self-rule,

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:15.000
privatization of media

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:19.000
and introducing freedom of information acts.

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:21.000
So the dynamic perspective

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:23.000
fits both with China and in India

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:25.000
in terms of the direction.

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:28.000
Why do many people believe

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:31.000
that India is still a growth disaster?

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:33.000
One reason

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:36.000
is they are always comparing India with China.

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:38.000
But China is a superstar

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:40.000
in terms of economic growth.

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:42.000
If you are a NBA player

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:45.000
and you are always being compared to Michael Jordan,

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:47.000
you're going to look not so impressive.

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:49.000
But that doesn't mean

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:51.000
that you're a bad basketball player.

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:53.000
Comparing with a superstar

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:55.000
is the wrong benchmark.

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:57.000
In fact, if you compare India

00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:59.000
with the average developing country,

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:02.000
even before the more recent period

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:04.000
of acceleration of Indian growth --

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:07.000
now India is growing between eight and nine percent --

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:09.000
even before this period,

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:12.000
India was ranked fourth in terms of economic growth

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:15.000
among emerging economies.

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:18.000
This is a very impressive record indeed.

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:21.000
Let's think about the future:

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:24.000
the dragon vis-a-vis the elephant.

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:27.000
Which country has the growth momentum?

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:30.000
China, I believe, still has

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:33.000
some of the excellent raw fundamentals --

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:35.000
mostly the social capital,

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:37.000
the public health,

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:39.000
the sense of egalitarianism

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:41.000
that you don't find in India.

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:43.000
But I believe that India has the momentum.

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:45.000
It has the improving fundamentals.

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:48.000
The government has invested in basic education,

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:50.000
has invested in basic health.

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:52.000
I believe the government should do more,

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:54.000
but nevertheless, the direction it is moving in

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:56.000
is the right direction.

00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:59.000
India has the right institutional conditions

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:01.000
for economic growth,

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:03.000
whereas China is still struggling

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:05.000
with political reforms.

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:08.000
I believe that the political reforms are a must for China

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:11.000
to maintain its growth.

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:13.000
And it's very important to have political reforms,

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:16.000
to have widely shared benefits of economic growth.

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:18.000
I don't know whether that's going to happen or not,

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:20.000
but I'm an optimist.

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:23.000
Hopefully, five years from now, I'm going to report to TEDGlobal

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:25.000
that political reforms will happen in China.

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:27.000
Thank you very much.

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:30.000
