00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Now this is a very un-TED-like thing to do,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
but let's kick off the afternoon

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
with a message

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
from a mystery sponsor.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Anonymous: Dear Fox News,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
it has come to our unfortunate attention

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
that both the name and nature of Anonymous

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
has been ravaged.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
We are everyone. We are no one.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
We are anonymous. We are legion.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
We do not forgive. We do not forget.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
We are but the base of chaos.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
Misha Glenny: Anonymous, ladies and gentlemen --

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
a sophisticated group

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
of politically motivated hackers

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
who have emerged in 2011.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
And they're pretty scary.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
You never know when they're going to attack next,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
who or what the consequences will be.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
But interestingly,

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
they have a sense of humor.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.000
These guys hacked into Fox News' Twitter account

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000
to announce President Obama's assassination.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
Now you can imagine the panic that would have generated

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
in the newsroom at Fox.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
"What do we do now?

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
Put on a black armband, or crack open the champagne?"

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
(Laughter)

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.000
And of course, who could escape the irony

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
of a member of Rupert Murdoch's News Corp.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
being a victim of hacking for a change.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
(Laughter)

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.000
(Applause)

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
Sometimes you turn on the news

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
and you say, "Is there anyone left to hack?"

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
Sony Playstation Network -- done,

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
the government of Turkey -- tick,

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
Britain's Serious Organized Crime Agency -- a breeze,

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
the CIA -- falling off a log.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
In fact, a friend of mine from the security industry

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
told me the other day

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
that there are two types of companies in the world:

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
those that know they've been hacked, and those that don't.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
I mean three companies

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.000
providing cybersecurity services to the FBI

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
have been hacked.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
Is nothing sacred anymore, for heaven's sake?

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
Anyway, this mysterious group Anonymous --

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
and they would say this themselves --

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
they are providing a service

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000
by demonstrating how useless companies are

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000
at protecting our data.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
But there is also a very serious aspect to Anonymous --

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
they are ideologically driven.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
They claim that they are battling

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000
a dastardly conspiracy.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
They say that governments are trying

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
to take over the Internet and control it,

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
and that they, Anonymous,

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000
are the authentic voice of resistance --

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
be it against Middle Eastern dictatorships,

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000
against global media corporations,

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
or against intelligence agencies,

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
or whoever it is.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.000
And their politics are not entirely unattractive.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
Okay, they're a little inchoate.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
There's a strong whiff

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000
of half-baked anarchism about them.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000
But one thing is true:

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
we are at the beginning

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
of a mighty struggle

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000
for control of the Internet.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
The Web links everything,

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000
and very soon

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000
it will mediate most human activity.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000
Because the Internet has fashioned

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
a new and complicated environment

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000
for an old-age dilemma

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
that pits the demands of security

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000
with the desire for freedom.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.000
Now this is a very complicated struggle.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.000
And unfortunately, for mortals like you and me,

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.000
we probably can't understand it very well.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000
Nonetheless,

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000
in an unexpected attack of hubris

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000
a couple of years ago,

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.000
I decided I would try and do that.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.000
And I sort of get it.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000
These were the various things that I was looking at

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000
as I was trying to understand it.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000
But in order to try and explain the whole thing,

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000
I would need another 18 minutes or so to do it,

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:11.000
so you're just going to have to take it on trust from me on this occasion,

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000
and let me assure you that all of these issues

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.000
are involved in cybersecurity and control of the Internet

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000
one way or the other,

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000
but in a configuration

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.000
that even Stephen Hawking would probably have difficulty

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.000
trying to get his head around.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
So there you are.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
And as you see, in the middle,

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
there is our old friend, the hacker.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.000
The hacker is absolutely central

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000
to many of the political, social

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.000
and economic issues affecting the Net.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.000
And so I thought to myself,

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.000
"Well, these are the guys who I want to talk to."

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.000
And what do you know,

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000
nobody else does talk to the hackers.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000
They're completely anonymous, as it were.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000
So despite the fact

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.000
that we are beginning to pour billions,

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000
hundreds of billions of dollars,

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.000
into cybersecurity --

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.000
for the most extraordinary technical solutions --

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000
no one wants to talk

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000
to these guys, the hackers,

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.000
who are doing everything.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:20.000
Instead, we prefer these really dazzling technological solutions,

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.000
which cost a huge amount of money.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.000
And so nothing is going into the hackers.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000
Well, I say nothing,

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:32.000
but actually there is one teeny weeny little research unit

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.000
in Turin, Italy

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.000
called the Hackers Profiling Project.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.000
And they are doing some fantastic research

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000
into the characteristics,

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.000
into the abilities

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000
and the socialization of hackers.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.000
But because they're a U.N. operation,

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000
maybe that's why governments and corporations

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000
are not that interested in them.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.000
Because it's a U.N. operation,

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.000
of course, it lacks funding.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.000
But I think they're doing very important work.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:04.000
Because where we have a surplus of technology

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.000
in the cybersecurity industry,

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.000
we have a definite lack of --

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000
call me old-fashioned --

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000
human intelligence.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.000
Now, so far I've mentioned

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.000
the hackers Anonymous

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.000
who are a politically motivated hacking group.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.000
Of course, the criminal justice system

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.000
treats them as common old garden criminals.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000
But interestingly,

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000
Anonymous does not make use of its hacked information

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000
for financial gain.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:35.000
But what about the real cybercriminals?

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.000
Well real organized crime on the Internet

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.000
goes back about 10 years

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:45.000
when a group of gifted Ukrainian hackers

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000
developed a website,

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000
which led to the industrialization

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:52.000
of cybercrime.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:55.000
Welcome to the now forgotten realm of CarderPlanet.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000
This is how they were advertising themselves

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.000
a decade ago on the Net.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.000
Now CarderPlanet was very interesting.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.000
Cybercriminals would go there

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:10.000
to buy and sell stolen credit card details,

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.000
to exchange information

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.000
about new malware that was out there.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.000
And remember, this is a time

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.000
when we're seeing for the first time

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.000
so-called off-the-shelf malware.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.000
This is ready for use, out-of-the-box stuff,

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.000
which you can deploy

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:30.000
even if you're not a terribly sophisticated hacker.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.000
And so CarderPlanet became a sort of supermarket

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.000
for cybercriminals.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.000
And its creators

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.000
were incredibly smart and entrepreneurial,

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.000
because they were faced

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:44.000
with one enormous challenge as cybercriminals.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.000
And that challenge is:

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.000
How do you do business,

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.000
how do you trust

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000
somebody on the Web who you want to do business with

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:55.000
when you know that they're a criminal?

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.000
(Laughter)

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.000
It's axiomatic that they're dodgy,

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:02.000
and they're going to want to try and rip you off.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:05.000
So the family, as the inner core of CarderPlanet was known,

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.000
came up with this brilliant idea

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.000
called the escrow system.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:12.000
They appointed an officer

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.000
who would mediate between the vendor and the purchaser.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.000
The vendor, say, had stolen credit card details;

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:21.000
the purchaser wanted to get a hold of them.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:24.000
The purchaser would send the administrative officer

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000
some dollars digitally,

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:29.000
and the vendor would sell the stolen credit card details.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:32.000
And the officer would then verify

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:35.000
if the stolen credit card worked.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.000
And if they did,

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.000
he then passed on the money to the vendor

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.000
and the stolen credit card details to the purchaser.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.000
And it was this

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:49.000
which completely revolutionized cybercrime on the Web.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000
And after that, it just went wild.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.000
We had a champagne decade

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:56.000
for people who we know as Carders.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.000
Now I spoke to one of these Carders

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.000
who we'll call RedBrigade --

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000
although that wasn't even his proper nickname --

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000
but I promised I wouldn't reveal who he was.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:07.000
And he explained to me how in 2003 and 2004

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:10.000
he would go on sprees in New York,

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:13.000
taking out $10,000 from an ATM here,

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:16.000
$30,000 from an ATM there,

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:19.000
using cloned credit cards.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:22.000
He was making, on average a week,

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:25.000
$150,000 --

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.000
tax free of course.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:30.000
And he said

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.000
that he had so much money

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.000
stashed in his upper-East side apartment at one point

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.000
that he just didn't know what to do with it

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.000
and actually fell into a depression.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.000
But that's a slightly different story,

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.000
which I won't go into now.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.000
Now the interesting thing about RedBrigade

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.000
is that he wasn't an advanced hacker.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.000
He sort of understood the technology,

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:52.000
and he realized that security was very important

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:55.000
if you were going to be a Carder,

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.000
but he didn't spend his days and nights

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.000
bent over a computer, eating pizza,

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.000
drinking coke and that sort of thing.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.000
He was out there on the town

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.000
having a fab time enjoying the high life.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.000
And this is because

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:10.000
hackers are only one element

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:13.000
in a cybercriminal enterprise.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:18.000
And often they're the most vulnerable element of all.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.000
And I want to explain this to you

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.000
by introducing you to six characters

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.000
who I met

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:28.000
while I was doing this research.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:31.000
Dimitry Golubov, aka SCRIPT --

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:34.000
born in Odessa, Ukraine in 1982.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:37.000
Now he developed his social and moral compass

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:40.000
on the Black Sea port during the 1990s.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:43.000
This was a sink-or-swim environment

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:47.000
where involvement in criminal or corrupt activities

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.000
was entirely necessary

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.000
if you wanted to survive.

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:53.000
As an accomplished computer user,

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.000
what Dimitry did

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:59.000
was to transfer the gangster capitalism of his hometown

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.000
onto the Worldwide Web.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:03.000
And he did a great job in it.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:05.000
You have to understand though

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:07.000
that from his ninth birthday,

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.000
the only environment he knew

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.000
was gangsterism.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.000
He knew no other way of making a living

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.000
and making money.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.000
Then we have Renukanth Subramaniam,

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.000
aka JiLsi --

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.000
founder of DarkMarket,

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.000
born in Colombo, Sri Lanka.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.000
As an eight year-old,

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.000
he and his parents fled the Sri Lankan capital

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:30.000
because Singhalese mobs were roaming the city,

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:33.000
looking for Tamils like Renu to murder.

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.000
At 11, he was interrogated by the Sri Lankan military,

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:37.000
accused of being a terrorist,

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:41.000
and his parents sent him on his own to Britain

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:44.000
as a refugee seeking political asylum.

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:46.000
At 13,

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:49.000
with only little English and being bullied at school,

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:52.000
he escaped into a world of computers

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.000
where he showed great technical ability,

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:57.000
but he was soon being seduced

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.000
by people on the Internet.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:02.000
He was convicted of mortgage and credit card fraud,

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:05.000
and he will be released from Wormwood Scrubs jail in London

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:07.000
in 2012.

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:11.000
Matrix001,

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:14.000
who was an administrator at DarkMarket.

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.000
Born in Southern Germany

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.000
to a stable and well-respected middle class family,

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:21.000
his obsession with gaming as a teenager

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:23.000
led him to hacking.

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:27.000
And he was soon controlling huge servers around the world

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:29.000
where he stored his games

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:31.000
that he had cracked and pirated.

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:33.000
His slide into criminality

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:35.000
was incremental.

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:38.000
And when he finally woke up to his situation

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.000
and understood the implications,

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:43.000
he was already in too deep.

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:45.000
Max Vision, aka ICEMAN --

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:47.000
mastermind of CardersMarket.

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:49.000
Born in Meridian, Idaho.

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:53.000
Max Vision was one of the best penetration testers

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:56.000
working out of Santa Clara, California

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.000
in the late 90s for private companies

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:01.000
and voluntarily for the FBI.

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:03.000
Now in the late 1990s,

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:05.000
he discovered a vulnerability

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:08.000
on all U.S. government networks,

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:10.000
and he went in and patched it up --

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:14.000
because this included nuclear research facilities --

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.000
sparing the American government

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.000
a huge security embarrassment.

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:21.000
But also, because he was an inveterate hacker,

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.000
he left a tiny digital wormhole

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:25.000
through which he alone could crawl.

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:28.000
But this was spotted by an eagle-eye investigator,

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.000
and he was convicted.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.000
At his open prison,

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.000
he came under the influence of financial fraudsters,

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:36.000
and those financial fraudsters

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.000
persuaded him to work for them

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.000
on his release.

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:43.000
And this man with a planetary-sized brain

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:45.000
is now serving a 13-year sentence

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.000
in California.

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:50.000
Adewale Taiwo, aka FreddyBB --

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.000
master bank account cracker

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:55.000
from Abuja in Nigeria.

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:58.000
He set up his prosaically entitled newsgroup,

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:03.000
bankfrauds@yahoo.co.uk

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:05.000
before arriving in Britain

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:07.000
in 2005

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:09.000
to take a Masters in chemical engineering

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:11.000
at Manchester University.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:14.000
He impressed in the private sector,

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:17.000
developing chemical applications for the oil industry

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:19.000
while simultaneously running

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:22.000
a worldwide bank and credit card fraud operation that was worth millions

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:26.000
until his arrest in 2008.

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.000
And then finally, Cagatay Evyapan,

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.000
aka Cha0 --

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.000
one of the most remarkable hackers ever,

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.000
from Ankara in Turkey.

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:37.000
He combined the tremendous skills of a geek

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:41.000
with the suave social engineering skills

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:44.000
of the master criminal.

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:47.000
One of the smartest people I've ever met.

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:49.000
He also had the most effective

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:51.000
virtual private network security arrangement

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:53.000
the police have ever encountered

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:55.000
amongst global cybercriminals.

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:57.000
Now the important thing

00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:59.000
about all of these people

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:01.000
is they share certain characteristics

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:05.000
despite the fact that they come from very different environments.

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:08.000
They are all people who learned their hacking skills

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:11.000
in their early to mid-teens.

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:13.000
They are all people

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:15.000
who demonstrate advanced ability

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:18.000
in maths and the sciences.

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.000
Remember that, when they developed those hacking skills,

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:24.000
their moral compass had not yet developed.

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:27.000
And most of them, with the exception of SCRIPT and Cha0,

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:31.000
they did not demonstrate

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:34.000
any real social skills in the outside world --

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:36.000
only on the Web.

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:38.000
And the other thing is

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:40.000
the high incidence of hackers like these

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:43.000
who have characteristics which are consistent

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:46.000
with Asperger's syndrome.

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:48.000
Now I discussed this

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:50.000
with Professor Simon Baron-Cohen

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:54.000
who's the professor of developmental psychopathology at Cambridge.

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:58.000
And he has done path-breaking work on autism

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:00.000
and confirmed, also for the authorities here,

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:02.000
that Gary McKinnon --

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:04.000
who is wanted by the United States

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:06.000
for hacking into the Pentagon --

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:08.000
suffers from Asperger's

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:10.000
and a secondary condition

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:12.000
of depression.

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:14.000
And Baron-Cohen explained

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:16.000
that certain disabilities

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:19.000
can manifest themselves in the hacking and computing world

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:21.000
as tremendous skills,

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:23.000
and that we should not be throwing in jail

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:26.000
people who have such disabilities and skills

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:29.000
because they have lost their way socially

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:31.000
or been duped.

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:34.000
Now I think we're missing a trick here,

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:37.000
because I don't think people like Max Vision should be in jail.

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:39.000
And let me be blunt about this.

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:42.000
In China, in Russia and in loads of other countries

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:45.000
that are developing cyber-offensive capabilities,

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:47.000
this is exactly what they are doing.

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:49.000
They are recruiting hackers

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:52.000
both before and after they become involved

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:55.000
in criminal and industrial espionage activities --

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:57.000
are mobilizing them

00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:59.000
on behalf of the state.

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:01.000
We need to engage

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:03.000
and find ways of offering guidance

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:05.000
to these young people,

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:07.000
because they are a remarkable breed.

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:09.000
And if we rely, as we do at the moment,

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:12.000
solely on the criminal justice system

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:15.000
and the threat of punitive sentences,

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:18.000
we will be nurturing a monster we cannot tame.

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:20.000
Thank you very much for listening.

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:33.000
(Applause)

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:35.000
Chris Anderson: So your idea worth spreading

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:37.000
is hire hackers.

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:41.000
How would someone get over that kind of fear

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:43.000
that the hacker they hire

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:45.000
might preserve that little teensy wormhole?

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:47.000
MG: I think to an extent,

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:49.000
you have to understand

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:52.000
that it's axiomatic among hackers that they do that.

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:55.000
They're just relentless and obsessive

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:57.000
about what they do.

00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:59.000
But all of the people who I've spoken to

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:01.000
who have fallen foul of the law,

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:04.000
they have all said, "Please, please give us a chance

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:07.000
to work in the legitimate industry.

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:10.000
We just never knew how to get there, what we were doing.

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:12.000
We want to work with you."

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:15.000
Chris Anderson: Okay, well that makes sense. Thanks a lot Misha.

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:18.000
(Applause)
