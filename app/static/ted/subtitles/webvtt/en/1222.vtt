WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
My name is Kate Hartman.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
And I like to make devices

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
that play with the ways

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
that we relate and communicate.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
So I'm specifically interested in how we, as humans,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
relate to ourselves, each other

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
and the world around us.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
(Laughter)

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
So just to give you a bit of context,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
as June said, I'm an artist, a technologist and an educator.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
I teach courses in physical computing

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
and wearable electronics.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
And much of what I do is either wearable

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
or somehow related to the human form.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
And so anytime I talk about what I do,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
I like to just quickly address

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
the reason why bodies matter.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
And it's pretty simple.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
Everybody's got one -- all of you.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
I can guarantee, everyone in this room,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
all of you over there, the people in the cushy seats,

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
the people up top with the laptops --

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
we all have bodies.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
Don't be ashamed.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
It's something that we have in common

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
and they act as our primary interfaces for the world.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
And so when working as an interaction designer,

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
or as an artist who deals with participation --

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.000
creating things that live on, in or around the human form --

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
it's really a powerful space to work within.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
So within my own work,

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
I use a broad range of materials and tools.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
So I communicate through everything from radio transceivers

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
to funnels and plastic tubing.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
And to tell you a bit about the things that I make,

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
the easiest place to start the story

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
is with a hat.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
And so it all started several years ago,

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
late one night when I was sitting on the subway, riding home,

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
and I was thinking.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
And I tend to be a person who thinks too much and talks too little.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
And so I was thinking about how it might be great

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
if I could just take all these noises --

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
like all these sounds of my thoughts in my head --

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
if I could just physically extricate them

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
and pull them out in such a form

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
that I could share them with somebody else.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
And so I went home, and I made a prototype of this hat.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
And I called it the Muttering Hat,

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
because it emitted these muttering noises

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
that were kind of tethered to you,

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
but you could detach them

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000
and share them with somebody else.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:25.000
(Laughter)

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
So I make other hats as well.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
This one is called the Talk to Yourself Hat.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
(Laughter)

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
It's fairly self-explanatory.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.000
It physically carves out conversation space for one.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
And when you speak out loud,

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.000
the sound of your voice is actually channeled back into your own ears.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
(Laughter)

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
And so when I make these things,

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000
it's really not so much about the object itself,

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.000
but rather the negative space around the object.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000
So what happens when a person puts this thing on?

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
What kind of an experience do they have?

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
And how are they transformed by wearing it?

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
So many of these devices

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000
really kind of focus on the ways in which we relate to ourselves.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000
So this particular device is called the Gut Listener.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
And it is a tool

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000
that actually enables one

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000
to listen to their own innards.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:28.000
(Laughter)

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.000
And so some of these things

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000
are actually more geared toward expression and communication.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000
And so the Inflatable Heart

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000
is an external organ

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.000
that can be used by the wearer to express themselves.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.000
So they can actually inflate it and deflate it

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000
according to their emotions.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000
So they can express everything from admiration and lust

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.000
to anxiety and angst.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000
(Laughter)

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000
And some of these are actually meant

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000
to mediate experiences.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
So the Discommunicator is a tool for arguments.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
(Laughter)

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.000
And so actually it allows for an intense emotional exchange,

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000
but is serves to absorb

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.000
the specificity of the words that are delivered.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:16.000
(Laughter)

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000
And in the end,

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000
some of these things just act as invitations.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.000
So the Ear Bender literally puts something out there

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.000
so someone can grab your ear

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000
and say what they have to say.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000
So even though I'm really interested in the relationship

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000
between people,

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000
I also consider the ways

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000
in which we relate to the world around us.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.000
And so when I was first living in New York City a few years back,

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000
I was thinking a lot about

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000
the familiar architectural forms that surrounded me

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.000
and how I would like to better relate to them.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000
And I thought, "Well, hey!

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000
Maybe if I want to better relate to walls,

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000
maybe I need to be more wall-like myself."

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000
So I made a wearable wall

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000
that I could wear as a backpack.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000
And so I would put it on

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000
and sort of physically transform myself

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000
so that I could either contribute to or critique

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000
the spaces that surrounded me.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000
(Laughter)

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.000
And so jumping off of that,

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.000
thinking beyond the built environment into the natural world,

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.000
I have this ongoing project called Botanicalls --

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000
which actually enables houseplants

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000
to tap into human communication protocols.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000
So when a plant is thirsty,

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000
it can actually make a phone call

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.000
or post a message to a service like Twitter.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:29.000
And so this really shifts the human/plant dynamic,

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.000
because a single house plant

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.000
can actually express its needs

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.000
to thousands of people at the same time.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000
And so kind of thinking about scale,

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000
my most recent obsession

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:45.000
is actually with glaciers -- of course.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.000
And so glaciers are these magnificent beings,

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.000
and there's lots of reasons to be obsessed with them,

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000
but what I'm particularly interested in

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.000
is in human-glacier relations.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000
(Laughter)

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.000
Because there seems to be an issue.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000
The glaciers are actually leaving us.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.000
They're both shrinking and retreating --

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000
and some of them have disappeared altogether.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.000
And so I actually live in Canada now,

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000
so I've been visiting one of my local glaciers.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000
And this one's particularly interesting,

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000
because, of all the glaciers in North America,

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.000
it receives the highest volume of human traffic in a year.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.000
They actually have these buses that drive up and over the lateral moraine

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.000
and drop people off on the surface of the glacier.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.000
And this has really gotten me thinking

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000
about this experience of the initial encounter.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:31.000
When I meet a glacier for the very first time,

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.000
what do I do?

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:37.000
There's no kind of social protocol for this.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000
I really just don't even know

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.000
how to say hello.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.000
Do I carve a message in the snow?

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.000
Or perhaps I can assemble one

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.000
out of dot and dash ice cubes --

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.000
ice cube Morse code.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.000
Or perhaps I need to make myself a speaking tool,

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000
like an icy megaphone

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000
that I can use to amplify my voice

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.000
when I direct it at the ice.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000
But really the most satisfying experience I've had

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000
is the act of listening,

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000
which is what we need in any good relationship.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:07.000
And I was really struck by how much it affected me.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:10.000
This very basic shift in my physical orientation

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.000
helped me shift my perspective

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.000
in relation to the glacier.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.000
And so since we use devices

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:20.000
to figure out how to relate to the world these days,

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:23.000
I actually made a device called the Glacier Embracing Suit.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.000
(Laughter)

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:28.000
And so this is constructed out of a heat reflected material

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000
that serves to mediate the difference in temperature

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.000
between the human body and the glacial ice.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:36.000
And once again, it's this invitation

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:40.000
that asks people to lay down on the glacier

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.000
and give it a hug.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.000
So, yea, this is actually just the beginning.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.000
These are initial musings for this project.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:50.000
And just as with the wall, how I wanted to be more wall-like,

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:54.000
with this project, I'd actually like to take more a of glacial pace.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.000
And so my intent

00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:00.000
is to actually just take the next 10 years

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:04.000
and go on a series of collaborative projects

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.000
where I work with people from different disciplines --

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.000
artists, technologists, scientists --

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.000
to kind of work on this project

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:13.000
of how we can improve human-glacier relations.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:17.000
So beyond that, in closing,

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:20.000
I'd just like to say that we're in this era

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:23.000
of communications and device proliferation,

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:26.000
and it's really tremendous and exciting and sexy,

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000
but I think what's really important

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.000
is thinking about how we can simultaneously

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.000
maintain a sense of wonder and a sense of criticality

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.000
about the tools that we use and the ways in which we relate to the world.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.000
Thanks.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:44.000
(Applause)
