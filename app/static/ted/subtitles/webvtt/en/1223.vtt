WEBVTT

00:00:01.071 --> 00:00:02.223
Ladies and gentlemen,

00:00:02.247 --> 00:00:04.374
I present to you the human genome.

00:00:04.398 --> 00:00:08.277
(Applause)

00:00:08.301 --> 00:00:12.234
Chromosome one -- top left,
bottom right -- are the sex chromosomes.

00:00:12.258 --> 00:00:14.986
Women have two copies
of that big X chromosome;

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:18.175
men have the X and, of course,
that small copy of the Y.

00:00:18.199 --> 00:00:21.890
Sorry boys, but it's just a tiny
little thing that makes you different.

00:00:21.914 --> 00:00:24.906
So if you zoom in on this genome,

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:28.548
then what you see, of course,
is this double-helix structure --

00:00:28.572 --> 00:00:31.706
the code of life spelled out
with these four biochemical letters,

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:33.976
or we call them bases: A, C, G and T.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.572
How many are there
in the human genome? Three billion.

00:00:36.596 --> 00:00:37.776
Is that a big number?

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.019
Well, everybody
can throw around big numbers.

00:00:40.043 --> 00:00:42.143
But in fact, if I were to place one base

00:00:42.167 --> 00:00:45.930
on each pixel of this
1280x800-resolution screen,

00:00:45.954 --> 00:00:49.233
we would need 3,000 screens
to take a look at the genome.

00:00:49.257 --> 00:00:50.465
So it's really quite big.

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.384
And perhaps because of its size,

00:00:52.408 --> 00:00:55.259
a group of people -- all,
by the way, with Y chromosomes --

00:00:55.283 --> 00:00:57.293
decided they would want to sequence it.

00:00:57.317 --> 00:00:59.332
(Laughter)

00:00:59.356 --> 00:01:02.613
And so 15 years, actually,
and about four billion dollars later,

00:01:02.637 --> 00:01:04.512
the genome was sequenced and published.

00:01:04.536 --> 00:01:07.856
In 2003, the final version was published,
and they keep working on it.

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:09.869
That was all done on a machine like this.

00:01:09.893 --> 00:01:13.210
It costs about a dollar for each base --
a very slow way of doing it.

00:01:13.234 --> 00:01:14.829
Well, folks, I'm here to tell you

00:01:14.853 --> 00:01:16.944
that the world has completely changed,

00:01:16.968 --> 00:01:18.778
and none of you know about it.

00:01:18.802 --> 00:01:21.491
So now what we do is take a genome,

00:01:21.515 --> 00:01:23.054
we make maybe 50 copies of it,

00:01:23.078 --> 00:01:26.098
we cut all those copies up
into little 50-base reads,

00:01:26.122 --> 00:01:28.463
and then we sequence them,
massively parallel.

00:01:28.487 --> 00:01:31.574
Then we bring that into software
and reassemble it,

00:01:31.598 --> 00:01:33.168
and tell you what the story is.

00:01:33.192 --> 00:01:35.507
So to give you a picture
of what this looks like,

00:01:35.531 --> 00:01:38.014
the Human Genome Project:
3 gigabases, right?

00:01:38.038 --> 00:01:42.690
One run on one of these modern machines:
200 gigabases in a week.

00:01:42.714 --> 00:01:45.227
And that 200 is going
to change to 600 this summer,

00:01:45.251 --> 00:01:47.393
and there's no sign of this pace slowing.

00:01:47.809 --> 00:01:51.394
The price of a base, to sequence a base,

00:01:51.418 --> 00:01:54.171
has fallen 100 million times.

00:01:54.195 --> 00:01:57.971
That's the equivalent of you filling up
your car with gas in 1998,

00:01:57.995 --> 00:01:59.224
waiting until 2011,

00:01:59.248 --> 00:02:01.661
and now you can drive
to Jupiter and back twice.

00:02:01.685 --> 00:02:05.976
(Laughter)

00:02:06.449 --> 00:02:07.976
World population,

00:02:08.861 --> 00:02:10.017
PC placements,

00:02:10.711 --> 00:02:12.975
the archive of all of medical literature,

00:02:13.497 --> 00:02:14.697
Moore's law,

00:02:15.219 --> 00:02:17.048
the old way of sequencing,

00:02:17.072 --> 00:02:18.829
and here's all the new stuff.

00:02:18.853 --> 00:02:20.194
Guys, this is a long scale;

00:02:20.218 --> 00:02:22.976
you don't typically see
lines that go up like that.

00:02:23.442 --> 00:02:26.900
So the worldwide capacity
to sequence human genomes

00:02:26.924 --> 00:02:30.093
is something like 50,000 to 100,000
human genomes this year.

00:02:30.117 --> 00:02:32.820
We know this based on the machines
that are being placed.

00:02:32.844 --> 00:02:35.361
This is expected to double,
triple or maybe quadruple

00:02:35.385 --> 00:02:37.595
year over year for the foreseeable future.

00:02:37.619 --> 00:02:39.604
In fact, there's one lab in particular

00:02:39.628 --> 00:02:42.564
that represents 20 percent
of all that capacity:

00:02:42.588 --> 00:02:44.976
It's called the Beijing
Genomics Institute.

00:02:45.406 --> 00:02:49.111
The Chinese are absolutely winning
this race to the new Moon, by the way.

00:02:49.135 --> 00:02:50.873
What does this mean for medicine?

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:54.184
So a woman, age 37,

00:02:54.208 --> 00:02:57.422
presents with stage 2 estrogen
receptor-positive breast cancer.

00:02:57.446 --> 00:03:00.613
She is treated with surgery,
chemotherapy and radiation.

00:03:00.637 --> 00:03:01.821
She goes home.

00:03:01.845 --> 00:03:02.996
Two years later,

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:06.194
she comes back with stage 3C
ovarian cancer, unfortunately;

00:03:06.218 --> 00:03:08.655
treated again with surgery
and chemotherapy.

00:03:08.679 --> 00:03:10.933
She comes back three years later at age 42

00:03:10.957 --> 00:03:13.314
with more ovarian cancer,
more chemotherapy.

00:03:13.338 --> 00:03:14.807
Six months later,

00:03:14.831 --> 00:03:18.655
she comes back
with acute myeloid leukemia.

00:03:19.559 --> 00:03:22.565
She goes into respiratory failure
and dies eight days later.

00:03:22.589 --> 00:03:24.947
So first: the way in which
this woman was treated,

00:03:24.971 --> 00:03:28.414
in as little as 10 years,
will look like bloodletting.

00:03:28.438 --> 00:03:31.263
And it's because of people
like my colleague, Rick Wilson,

00:03:31.287 --> 00:03:33.626
at the Genome Institute
at Washington University,

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:36.109
who decided to take a look
at this woman postmortem.

00:03:36.133 --> 00:03:38.616
And he took skin cells, healthy skin

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:40.578
and cancerous bone marrow,

00:03:40.602 --> 00:03:42.888
and sequenced the whole
genomes of both of them

00:03:42.912 --> 00:03:44.976
in a couple of weeks, no big deal.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.201
Then he compared those two
genomes in software,

00:03:47.225 --> 00:03:49.050
and what he found, among other things,

00:03:49.074 --> 00:03:53.687
was a deletion -- a 2,000-base deletion
across three billion bases

00:03:53.711 --> 00:03:55.870
in a particular gene called TP53.

00:03:55.894 --> 00:03:58.306
If you have this deleterious
mutation in this gene,

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:01.052
you're 90 percent likely
to get cancer in your life.

00:04:01.076 --> 00:04:03.300
So unfortunately,
this doesn't help this woman,

00:04:03.324 --> 00:04:05.976
but it does have severe --
profound, if you will --

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.190
implications to her family.

00:04:08.801 --> 00:04:10.684
I mean, if they have the same mutation,

00:04:10.708 --> 00:04:13.253
and they get this genetic test
and they understand it,

00:04:13.277 --> 00:04:16.158
then they can get regular screens
and can catch cancer early,

00:04:16.182 --> 00:04:18.502
and potentially live
a significantly longer life.

00:04:18.526 --> 00:04:20.456
Let me introduce you to the Beery twins,

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:22.812
diagnosed with cerebral palsy
at the age of two.

00:04:22.836 --> 00:04:25.384
Their mom is a very brave woman
who didn't believe it;

00:04:25.408 --> 00:04:27.011
the symptoms weren't matching up.

00:04:27.035 --> 00:04:30.043
And through some heroic efforts
and a lot of Internet searching,

00:04:30.067 --> 00:04:32.238
she was able to convince
the medical community

00:04:32.262 --> 00:04:34.158
that, in fact, they had something else.

00:04:34.182 --> 00:04:36.348
They had dopa-responsive dystonia.

00:04:36.372 --> 00:04:38.351
And so they were given L-Dopa,

00:04:38.375 --> 00:04:40.692
and their symptoms did improve,

00:04:40.716 --> 00:04:42.559
but they weren't totally asymptomatic.

00:04:42.583 --> 00:04:44.050
Significant problems remained.

00:04:44.074 --> 00:04:47.243
Turns out the gentleman in this picture
is a guy named Joe Beery,

00:04:47.267 --> 00:04:48.910
who was lucky enough to be the CIO

00:04:48.934 --> 00:04:51.055
of a company called Life Technologies.

00:04:51.079 --> 00:04:52.421
They're one of two companies

00:04:52.445 --> 00:04:55.595
that makes these massive
whole-genome sequencing tools.

00:04:55.619 --> 00:04:58.632
And so he got his kids sequenced.

00:04:58.656 --> 00:05:01.734
What they found was a series of mutations
in a gene called SPR,

00:05:01.758 --> 00:05:05.155
which is responsible for producing
serotonin, among other things.

00:05:05.179 --> 00:05:08.668
So on top of L-Dopa, they gave
these kids a serotonin precursor drug,

00:05:08.692 --> 00:05:10.414
and they're effectively normal now.

00:05:10.438 --> 00:05:13.729
Guys, this would never have happened
without whole-genome sequencing.

00:05:13.753 --> 00:05:16.593
At the time -- this was
a few years ago -- it cost $100,000.

00:05:16.617 --> 00:05:18.444
Today it's $10,000, next year, $1,000,

00:05:18.468 --> 00:05:20.497
the year after, $100, give or take a year.

00:05:20.521 --> 00:05:22.021
That's how fast this is moving.

00:05:22.045 --> 00:05:23.902
So here's little Nick --

00:05:23.926 --> 00:05:25.642
likes Batman and squirt guns.

00:05:25.666 --> 00:05:29.361
And it turns out Nick
shows up at the children's hospital

00:05:29.385 --> 00:05:31.647
with this distended belly,
like a famine victim.

00:05:31.671 --> 00:05:34.507
And it's not that he's not eating;
it's that when he eats,

00:05:34.531 --> 00:05:37.942
his intestine basically opens up
and feces spill out into his gut.

00:05:37.966 --> 00:05:39.601
So a hundred surgeries later,

00:05:39.625 --> 00:05:43.300
he looks at his mom and says,
"Mom, please pray for me.

00:05:43.324 --> 00:05:44.727
I'm in so much pain."

00:05:45.148 --> 00:05:48.263
His pediatrician happens to have
a background in clinical genetics

00:05:48.287 --> 00:05:49.976
and he has no idea what's going on,

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.543
but he says, "Let's get
this kid's genome sequenced."

00:05:52.567 --> 00:05:54.707
And what they find
is a single-point mutation

00:05:54.731 --> 00:05:57.580
in a gene responsible for controlling
programmed cell death.

00:05:57.604 --> 00:06:00.682
So the theory is that he's having
some immunological reaction

00:06:00.706 --> 00:06:03.121
to what's going on --
to the food, essentially.

00:06:03.145 --> 00:06:06.515
And that's a natural reaction,
which causes some programmed cell death,

00:06:06.539 --> 00:06:08.809
but the gene that regulates
that down is broken.

00:06:08.833 --> 00:06:11.251
And so this informs,
among other things, of course,

00:06:11.275 --> 00:06:14.246
a treatment for bone marrow transplant,
which he undertakes.

00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:16.290
And after nine months
of grueling recovery,

00:06:16.314 --> 00:06:18.219
he's now eating steak with A1 sauce.

00:06:18.243 --> 00:06:19.340
(Laughter)

00:06:19.364 --> 00:06:23.463
The prospect of using the genome
as a universal diagnostic

00:06:23.487 --> 00:06:25.027
is upon us today.

00:06:26.202 --> 00:06:27.741
Today. It's here.

00:06:27.765 --> 00:06:29.257
And what it means for all of us

00:06:29.281 --> 00:06:32.568
is that everybody in this room
could live an extra 5, 10, 20 years,

00:06:32.592 --> 00:06:34.259
just because of this one thing.

00:06:34.283 --> 00:06:36.346
Which is a fantastic story,

00:06:36.370 --> 00:06:39.248
unless you think about
humanity's footprint on the planet,

00:06:39.272 --> 00:06:41.747
and our ability to keep up
food production.

00:06:41.771 --> 00:06:43.343
So it turns out

00:06:43.367 --> 00:06:47.308
that the very same technology
is also being used to grow new lines

00:06:47.332 --> 00:06:50.461
of corn, wheat, soybean and other crops

00:06:50.485 --> 00:06:52.660
that are highly tolerant
of drought, of flood,

00:06:52.684 --> 00:06:54.207
of pests and pesticides.

00:06:54.231 --> 00:06:55.405
Now, look --

00:06:55.924 --> 00:06:58.298
as long as we continue
to increase the population,

00:06:58.322 --> 00:07:01.501
we'll have to continue to grow and eat
genetically modified foods.

00:07:01.525 --> 00:07:03.676
And that's the only position
I'll take today.

00:07:03.700 --> 00:07:05.518
Unless there's anybody in the audience

00:07:05.542 --> 00:07:07.763
who'd like to volunteer to stop eating?

00:07:07.787 --> 00:07:09.138
None, not one.

00:07:09.701 --> 00:07:10.902
This is a typewriter,

00:07:11.436 --> 00:07:14.055
a staple of every desktop for decades.

00:07:14.079 --> 00:07:17.663
And, in fact, the typewriter
was essentially deleted by this thing.

00:07:18.243 --> 00:07:21.508
And then more general versions
of word processors came about.

00:07:21.532 --> 00:07:24.311
But ultimately, it was a disruption
on top of a disruption.

00:07:24.335 --> 00:07:26.403
It was Bob Metcalfe
inventing the Ethernet,

00:07:26.427 --> 00:07:28.396
and the connection of all these computers

00:07:28.420 --> 00:07:30.270
that fundamentally changed everything.

00:07:30.294 --> 00:07:33.095
Suddenly we had Netscape, we had Yahoo.

00:07:33.119 --> 00:07:35.976
And we had, indeed,
the entire dot-com bubble.

00:07:36.688 --> 00:07:38.568
(Laughter)

00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:40.743
Not to worry though,

00:07:40.767 --> 00:07:43.342
that was quickly rescued
by the iPod, Facebook

00:07:43.366 --> 00:07:45.469
and, indeed, Angry Birds.

00:07:45.493 --> 00:07:47.469
(Laughter)

00:07:47.865 --> 00:07:50.391
Look, this is where we are today.

00:07:50.415 --> 00:07:53.205
This is the genomic revolution today.
This is where we are.

00:07:53.229 --> 00:07:54.809
What I'd like you to consider is:

00:07:54.833 --> 00:07:56.238
What does it mean

00:07:56.262 --> 00:07:59.619
when these dots don't represent
the individual bases of your genome,

00:07:59.643 --> 00:08:02.494
but they connect to genomes
all across the planet?

00:08:02.518 --> 00:08:06.106
I just recently had to buy life insurance,
and I was required to answer:

00:08:06.130 --> 00:08:08.261
A. I have never had a genetic test;

00:08:08.285 --> 00:08:09.768
B. I've had one, here you go;

00:08:09.792 --> 00:08:11.737
or C. I've had one and I'm not telling.

00:08:11.761 --> 00:08:13.477
Thankfully, I was able to answer A,

00:08:13.501 --> 00:08:17.049
and I say that honestly, in case
my life insurance agent is listening.

00:08:17.073 --> 00:08:19.472
But what would have happened
if I had said C?

00:08:19.496 --> 00:08:21.897
Consumer applications
for genomics will flourish.

00:08:21.921 --> 00:08:24.370
Do you want to see
if you're genetically compatible

00:08:24.394 --> 00:08:25.624
with your girlfriend?

00:08:25.648 --> 00:08:28.611
DNA sequencing on your iPhone?
There's an app for that.

00:08:28.635 --> 00:08:29.976
(Laughter)

00:08:30.445 --> 00:08:32.730
Personalized genomic massage, anyone?

00:08:33.778 --> 00:08:38.345
There's already a lab today that tests
for allele 334 of the AVPR1 gene,

00:08:38.369 --> 00:08:39.753
the so-called cheating gene.

00:08:39.777 --> 00:08:41.792
(Laughter)

00:08:41.816 --> 00:08:44.443
So anybody who's here today
with your significant other,

00:08:44.467 --> 00:08:47.334
just turn over to them,
swab their mouth, send it to the lab

00:08:47.358 --> 00:08:48.627
and you'll know for sure.

00:08:48.651 --> 00:08:49.762
(Laughter)

00:08:49.786 --> 00:08:51.728
Do you really want to elect a president

00:08:51.752 --> 00:08:54.014
whose genome suggests cardiomyopathy?

00:08:54.038 --> 00:08:55.898
Think of it -- it's 2016,

00:08:55.922 --> 00:08:57.628
and the leading candidate releases

00:08:57.652 --> 00:08:59.734
not only her four years
of back-tax returns,

00:08:59.758 --> 00:09:01.211
but also her personal genome.

00:09:01.235 --> 00:09:02.445
And it looks really good.

00:09:02.469 --> 00:09:05.065
Then she challenges all
her competitors to do the same.

00:09:05.089 --> 00:09:07.024
Do you think that's not going to happen?

00:09:07.048 --> 00:09:09.282
Do you think it would have
helped John McCain?

00:09:09.306 --> 00:09:11.099
(Laughter)

00:09:11.123 --> 00:09:14.341
How many people in the audience
have the last name Resnick, like me?

00:09:14.365 --> 00:09:15.523
Raise your hand.

00:09:15.547 --> 00:09:16.720
Anybody? Nobody.

00:09:17.175 --> 00:09:18.620
Typically, there's one or two.

00:09:18.644 --> 00:09:21.197
So my father's father
was one of 10 Resnick brothers.

00:09:21.221 --> 00:09:25.306
They all hated each other, and all moved
to different parts of the planet.

00:09:25.330 --> 00:09:28.249
So it's likely I'm related
to every Resnick that I ever meet,

00:09:28.273 --> 00:09:29.424
but I don't know.

00:09:29.448 --> 00:09:32.485
So imagine if my genome
were De-identified, sitting in software,

00:09:32.509 --> 00:09:34.893
And a third cousin's genome
was also sitting there,

00:09:34.917 --> 00:09:37.218
and there was software
that could compare the two

00:09:37.242 --> 00:09:38.599
and make these associations.

00:09:38.623 --> 00:09:41.931
Not hard to imagine. My company
has software that does this right now.

00:09:41.955 --> 00:09:43.123
Imagine one more thing,

00:09:43.147 --> 00:09:46.382
that that software is able to ask
both parties for mutual consent:

00:09:46.406 --> 00:09:48.731
"Would you be willing
to meet your third cousin?"

00:09:48.755 --> 00:09:50.405
And if we both say yes -- voilà!

00:09:50.429 --> 00:09:52.206
Welcome to Chromosomally LinkedIn.

00:09:52.230 --> 00:09:55.455
(Laughter)

00:09:56.548 --> 00:09:58.541
Now this is probably a good thing, right?

00:09:58.565 --> 00:10:00.153
Bigger clan gatherings and so on.

00:10:00.177 --> 00:10:01.878
But maybe it's a bad thing as well.

00:10:01.902 --> 00:10:04.183
How many fathers in the room?
Raise your hands.

00:10:04.207 --> 00:10:07.535
OK, so experts think
that one to three percent of you

00:10:07.559 --> 00:10:09.662
are not actually the father of your child.

00:10:09.686 --> 00:10:11.440
(Laughter)

00:10:11.464 --> 00:10:12.640
Look --

00:10:12.664 --> 00:10:16.640
(Laughter)

00:10:17.611 --> 00:10:19.976
These genomes, these 23 chromosomes,

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:23.365
they don't in any way represent
the quality of our relationships

00:10:23.389 --> 00:10:26.082
or the nature of our society --
at least not yet.

00:10:26.106 --> 00:10:27.901
And like any new technology,

00:10:27.925 --> 00:10:29.714
it's really in humanity's hands

00:10:29.738 --> 00:10:31.936
to wield it for the betterment of mankind

00:10:31.960 --> 00:10:33.111
or not.

00:10:33.135 --> 00:10:35.358
And so I urge you all
to wake up and to tune in

00:10:35.382 --> 00:10:38.778
and to influence the genomic revolution
that's happening all around you.

00:10:38.802 --> 00:10:39.953
Thank you.

00:10:39.977 --> 00:10:42.420
(Applause)
