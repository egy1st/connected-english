WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
I want to say that really and truly,

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
after these incredible speeches

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
and ideas that are being spread,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
I am in the awkward position

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
of being here to talk to you today

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
about television.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
So most everyone watches TV.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
We like it. We like some parts of it.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Here in America, people actually love TV.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
The average American watches TV

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
for almost 5 hours a day.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Okay?

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Now I happen to make my living these days in television,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
so for me, that's a good thing.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
But a lot of people don't love it so much.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
They, in fact, berate it.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
They call it stupid,

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
and worse, believe me.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
My mother, growing up,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
she called it the "idiot box."

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
But my idea today is not to debate

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
whether there's such a thing as good TV or bad TV;

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
my idea today

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
is to tell you that I believe

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
television has a conscience.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
So why I believe that television has a conscience

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
is that I actually believe

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
that television directly reflects

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
the moral, political,

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
social and emotional need states of our nation --

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
that television is how we actually disseminate

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
our entire value system.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
So all these things are uniquely human,

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
and they all add up

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
to our idea of conscience.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
Now today, we're not talking about good and bad TV.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
We're talking about popular TV.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
We're talking about top-10 Nielsen-rated shows

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
over the course of 50 years.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
How do these Nielsen ratings

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
reflect not just what you've heard about,

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.000
which is the idea of our social, collective unconscious,

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
but how do these top-10 Nielsen-rated shows

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
over 50 years

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
reflect the idea

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
of our social conscience?

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
How does television evolve over time,

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
and what does this say about our society?

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
Now speaking of evolution,

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
from basic biology, you probably remember

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
that the animal kingdom, including humans,

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
have four basic primal instincts.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000
You have hunger; you have sex; you have power;

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000
and you have the urge for acquisitiveness.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
As humans, what's important to remember

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000
is that we've developed, we've evolved over time

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
to temper, or tame,

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000
these basic animal instincts.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000
We have the capacity to laugh and cry.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
We feel awe, we feel pity.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
That is separate and apart

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
from the animal kingdom.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
The other thing about human beings

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
is that we love to be entertained.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
We love to watch TV.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000
This is something that clearly separates us

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
from the animal kingdom.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
Animals might love to play,

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000
but they don't love to watch.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
So I had an ambition

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
to discover what could be understood

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
from this uniquely human relationship

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
between television programs

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
and the human conscious.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
Why has television entertainment evolved the way it has?

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
I kind of think of it

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
as this cartoon devil or angel

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
sitting on our shoulders.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
Is television literally functioning

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
as our conscience,

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000
tempting us and rewarding us at the same time?

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
So to begin to answer these questions,

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
we did a research study.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
We went back 50 years

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000
to the 1959/1960 television season.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
We surveyed the top-20 Nielsen shows

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
every year for 50 years --

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
a thousand shows.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
We talked to over 3,000 individuals --

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
almost 3,600 --

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000
aged 18 to 70,

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000
and we asked them how they felt emotionally.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000
How did you feel

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.000
watching every single one of these shows?

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000
Did you feel a sense of moral ambiguity?

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.000
Did you feel outrage? Did you laugh?

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000
What did this mean for you?

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000
So to our global TED audiences,

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000
I want to say that this was a U.S. sample.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000
But as you can see,

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
these emotional need states are truly universal.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
And on a factual basis,

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.000
over 80 percent of the U.S.'s most popular shows

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000
are exported around the world.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000
So I really hope our global audiences

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000
can relate.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000
Two acknowledgments

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000
before our first data slide:

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000
For inspiring me

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.000
to even think about the idea of conscience

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:21.000
and the tricks that conscience can play on us on a daily basis,

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:25.000
I thank legendary rabbi, Jack Stern.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.000
And for the way in which I'm going to present the data,

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000
I want to thank TED community superstar Hans Rosling,

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000
who you may have just seen.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000
Okay, here we go.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000
So here you see,

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000
from 1960 to 2010,

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.000
the 50 years of our study.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000
Two things we're going to start with --

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.000
the inspiration state and the moral ambiguity state,

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000
which, for this purpose,

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000
we defined inspiration

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000
as television shows that uplift me,

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.000
that make me feel much more positive about the world.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.000
Moral ambiguity are televisions shows

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000
in which I don't understand

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.000
the difference between right and wrong.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000
As we start, you see in 1960

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000
inspiration is holding steady.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000
That's what we're watching TV for.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000
Moral ambiguity starts to climb.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000
Right at the end of the 60s,

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000
moral ambiguity is going up,

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000
inspiration is kind of on the wane.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000
Why?

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000
The Cuban Missile Crisis, JFK is shot,

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000
the Civil Rights movement,

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000
race riots, the Vietnam War,

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000
MLK is shot, Bobby Kennedy is shot,

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000
Watergate.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000
Look what happens.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.000
In 1970, inspiration plummets.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000
Moral ambiguity takes off.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.000
They cross,

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000
but Ronald Reagan, a telegenic president, is in office.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000
It's trying to recover.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.000
But look, it can't:

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000
AIDS, Iran-Contra,

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.000
the Challenger disaster, Chernobyl.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:52.000
Moral ambiguity becomes the dominant meme in television

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.000
from 1990 for the next 20 years.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000
Take a look at this.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.000
This chart is going to document a very similar trend.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.000
But in this case, we have comfort -- the bubble in red --

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.000
social commentary and irreverence

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.000
in blue and green.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.000
Now this time on TV

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.000
you have "Bonanza," don't forget, you have "Gunsmoke,"

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000
you have "Andy Griffith,"

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.000
you have domestic shows all about comfort.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.000
This is rising. Comfort stays whole.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000
Irreverence starts to rise.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.000
Social commentary is all of a sudden spiking up.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:28.000
You get to 1969, and look what happens.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.000
You have comfort, irreverence, and social commentary,

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:34.000
not only battling it out in our society,

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:38.000
but you literally have two establishment shows --

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.000
"Gunsmoke" and "Gomer Pyle" --

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:43.000
in 1969 are the number-two- and number-three-rated television shows.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.000
What's number one?

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.000
The socially irreverent hippie show,

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.000
"Rowan and Martin's Laugh-In."

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.000
They're all living together, right.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000
Viewers had responded dramatically.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.000
Look at this green spike in 1966

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.000
to a bellwether show.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000
When you guys hear this industry term, a breakout hit,

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.000
what does that mean?

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.000
It means in the 1966 television season,

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:10.000
The "Smothers Brothers" came out of nowhere.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.000
This was the first show

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.000
that allowed viewers to say,

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.000
"My God,

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:19.000
I can comment on how I feel about the Vietnam War,

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.000
about the presidency, through television?"

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.000
That's what we mean by a breakout show.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.000
So then, just like the last chart, look what happens.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000
In 1970,

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000
the dam bursts. The dam bursts.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:34.000
Comfort is no longer why we watch television.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000
Social commentary and irreverence

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.000
rise throughout the 70s.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.000
Now look at this.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.000
The 70s means who? Norman Lear.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.000
You have "All in the Family," "Sanford and Son,"

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.000
and the dominant show --

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.000
in the top-10 for the entire 70s --

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.000
"M<i>A</i>S*H."

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.000
In the entire 50 years

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:56.000
of television that we studied,

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:59.000
seven of 10 shows

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:02.000
ranked most highly for irreverence

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000
appeared on air during the Vietnam War,

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:08.000
five of the top-10 during the Nixon administration.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:11.000
Only one generation, 20 years in,

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.000
and we discovered,

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:16.000
Wow! TV can do that?

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.000
It can make me feel this?

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:21.000
It can change us?

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.000
So to this very, very savvy crowd,

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:26.000
I also want to note

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:29.000
the digital folks did not invent disruptive.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000
Archie Bunker was shoved out of his easy chair

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.000
along with the rest of us

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.000
40 years ago.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.000
This is a quick chart. Here's another attribute:

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.000
fantasy and imagination,

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.000
which are shows defined as,

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:44.000
"takes me out of my everyday realm"

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000
and "makes me feel better."

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.000
That's mapped against the red dot, unemployment,

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:52.000
which is a simple Bureau of Labor Department statistic.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.000
You'll see

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:57.000
that every time fantasy and imagination shows rise,

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:00.000
it maps to a spike in unemployment.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000
Do we want to see shows

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:05.000
about people saving money and being unemployed?

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.000
No. In the 70s

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:10.000
you have the bellwether show "The Bionic Woman"

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:13.000
that rocketed into the top-10 in 1973,

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:16.000
followed by the "Six Million-Dollar Man" and "Charlie's Angels."

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:19.000
Another spike in the 1980s --

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:23.000
another spike in shows about control and power.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.000
What were those shows?

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.000
Glamorous and rich.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:30.000
"Dallas," "Fantasy Island."

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:33.000
Incredible mapping of our national psyche

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.000
with some hard and fast facts:

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:38.000
unemployment.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:41.000
So here you are, in my favorite chart,

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.000
because this is our last 20 years.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.000
Whether or not you're in my business,

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:48.000
you have surely heard or read

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:51.000
of the decline of the thing called the three-camera sitcom

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:55.000
and the rise of reality TV.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.000
Well, as we say in the business,

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.000
X marks the spot.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.000
The 90s -- the big bubbles of humor --

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:04.000
we're watching "Friends," "Frasier," "Cheers" and "Seinfeld."

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:07.000
Everything's good, low unemployment.

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:10.000
But look: X marks the spot.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.000
In 2001,

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:15.000
the September 2001 television season,

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:19.000
humor succumbs to judgment once and for all.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.000
Why not?

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.000
We had a 2000 presidential election

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.000
decided by the Supreme Court.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.000
We had the bursting of the tech bubble.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.000
We had 9/11.

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:32.000
Anthrax becomes part of the social lexicon.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.000
Look what happens when we keep going.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:37.000
At the turn of the century, the Internet takes off,

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:40.000
reality television has taken hold.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.000
What do people want in their TV then?

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:45.000
I would have thought revenge

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.000
or nostalgia.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.000
Give me some comfort; my world is falling apart.

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.000
No, they want judgment.

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:53.000
I can vote you off the island.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:56.000
I can keep Sarah Palin's daughter dancing.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:59.000
I can choose the next American Idol. You're fired.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:02.000
That's all great, right?

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:06.000
So as dramatically different as these television shows,

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:09.000
pure entertainment, have been over the last 50 years --

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.000
what did I start with? --

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.000
one basic instinct remains.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:16.000
We're animals, we need our moms.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.000
There has not been a decade of television

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:22.000
without a definitive, dominant TV mom.

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.000
The 1950s:

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:27.000
June Cleever in the original comfort show, "Leave it to Beaver."

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:30.000
Lucille Ball kept us laughing

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:33.000
through the rise of social consciousness in the 60s.

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.000
Maude Findlay,

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:38.000
the epitome of the irreverent 1970s,

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.000
who tackled abortion, divorce,

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:42.000
even menopause on TV.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:44.000
The 1980s,

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:47.000
our first cougar was given to us

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:50.000
in the form of Alexis Carrington.

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.000
Murphy Brown took on a vice president

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:57.000
when she took on the idea of single parenthood.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.000
This era's mom,

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:02.000
Bree Van de Kamp.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:05.000
Now I don't know if this is the devil or the angel

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:07.000
sitting on our conscience,

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:09.000
sitting on television's shoulders,

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:13.000
but I do know that I absolutely love this image.

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.000
So to you all,

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.000
the women of TEDWomen, the men of TEDWomen,

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:21.000
the global audiences of TEDWomen,

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:23.000
thank you for letting me present my idea

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:25.000
about the conscience of television.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:28.000
But let me also thank the incredible creators

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.000
who get up everyday

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:33.000
to put their ideas on our television screens

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:35.000
throughout all these ages of television.

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:38.000
They give it life on television, for sure,

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.000
but it's you as viewers,

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:43.000
through your collective social consciences,

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:45.000
that give it life, longevity,

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:47.000
power or not.

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:49.000
So thanks very much.

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:51.000
(Applause)
