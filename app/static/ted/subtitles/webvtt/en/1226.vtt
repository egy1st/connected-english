00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Let's talk about billions.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Let's talk about

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
past and future billions.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
We know

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
that about 106 billion people

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
have ever lived.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
And we know that most of them are dead.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
And we also know

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
that most of them live or lived in Asia.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
And we also know

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
that most of them were or are very poor --

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
did not live for very long.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
Let's talk about billions.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
Let's talk about

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000
the 195,000 billion dollars of wealth

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
in the world today.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
We know that most of that wealth

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
was made after the year 1800.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
And we know that most of it

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
is currently owned

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000
by people we might call Westerners:

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000
Europeans, North Americans, Australasians.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
19 percent of the world's population today,

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.000
Westerners own two-thirds of its wealth.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
Economic historians

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
call this "The Great Divergence."

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
And this slide here

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
is the best simplification

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
of the Great Divergence story

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
I can offer you.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
It's basically two ratios

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
of per capita GDP,

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
per capita gross domestic product,

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
so average income.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
One, the red line,

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
is the ratio of British to Indian

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
per capita income.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
And the blue line

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
is the ratio of American to Chinese.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
And this chart goes back to 1500.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
And you can see here

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
that there's an exponential Great Divergence.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
They start off pretty close together.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
In fact, in 1500,

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
the average Chinese was richer than the average North American.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
When you get to the 1970s,

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
which is where this chart ends,

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
the average Briton is more than 10 times richer

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
than the average Indian.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
And that's allowing

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
for differences in the cost of living.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000
It's based on purchasing power parity.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
The average American

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
is nearly 20 times richer

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
than the average Chinese

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
by the 1970s.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000
So why?

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000
This wasn't just an economic story.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
If you take the 10 countries

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
that went on to become

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
the Western empires,

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000
in 1500 they were really quite tiny --

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000
five percent of the world's land surface,

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
16 percent of its population,

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
maybe 20 percent of its income.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
By 1913,

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000
these 10 countries, plus the United States,

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000
controlled vast global empires --

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
58 percent of the world's territory,

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000
about the same percentage of its population,

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000
and a really huge, nearly three-quarters share

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000
of global economic output.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.000
And notice, most of that went to the motherland,

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
to the imperial metropoles,

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000
not to their colonial possessions.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
Now you can't just blame this on imperialism --

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000
though many people have tried to do so --

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000
for two reasons.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000
One, empire was the least original thing

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000
that the West did after 1500.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
Everybody did empire.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000
They beat preexisting Oriental empires

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000
like the Mughals and the Ottomans.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000
So it really doesn't look like empire is a great explanation

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000
for the Great Divergence.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000
In any case, as you may remember,

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000
the Great Divergence reaches its zenith in the 1970s,

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:49.000
some considerable time after decolonization.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000
This is not a new question.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000
Samuel Johnson,

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000
the great lexicographer,

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.000
[posed] it through his character Rasselas

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000
in his novel "Rasselas, Prince of Abissinia,"

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.000
published in 1759.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.000
"By what means are the Europeans thus powerful;

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.000
or why, since they can so easily visit Asia and Africa

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.000
for trade or conquest,

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000
cannot the Asiaticks and Africans

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000
invade their coasts,

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000
plant colonies in their ports,

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.000
and give laws to their natural princes?

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.000
The same wind that carries them back

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000
would bring us thither?"

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000
That's a great question.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000
And you know what,

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000
it was also being asked at roughly the same time

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000
by the Resterners -- by the people in the rest of the world --

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.000
like Ibrahim Muteferrika,

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000
an Ottoman official,

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.000
the man who introduced printing, very belatedly,

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000
to the Ottoman Empire --

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.000
who said in a book published in 1731,

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000
"Why do Christian nations which were so weak in the past

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000
compared with Muslim nations

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:57.000
begin to dominate so many lands in modern times

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:01.000
and even defeat the once victorious Ottoman armies?"

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000
Unlike Rasselas,

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000
Muteferrika had an answer to that question,

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.000
which was correct.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.000
He said it was "because they have laws and rules

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.000
invented by reason."

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.000
It's not geography.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000
You may think we can explain the Great Divergence

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000
in terms of geography.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000
We know that's wrong,

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000
because we conducted two great natural experiments in the 20th century

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000
to see if geography mattered more than institutions.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.000
We took all the Germans,

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.000
we divided them roughly in two,

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.000
and we gave the ones in the East communism,

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.000
and you see the result.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000
Within an incredibly short period of time,

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.000
people living in the German Democratic Republic

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.000
produced Trabants, the Trabbi,

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.000
one of the world's worst ever cars,

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.000
while people in the West produced the Mercedes Benz.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.000
If you still don't believe me,

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000
we conducted the experiment also in the Korean Peninsula.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.000
And we decided we'd take Koreans

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000
in roughly the same geographical place

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:05.000
with, notice, the same basic traditional culture,

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.000
and we divided them in two, and we gave the Northerners communism.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.000
And the result is an even bigger divergence

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.000
in a very short space of time

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000
than happened in Germany.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:19.000
Not a big divergence in terms of uniform design for border guards admittedly,

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.000
but in almost every other respect,

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.000
it's a huge divergence.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.000
Which leads me to think

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000
that neither geography nor national character,

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000
popular explanations for this kind of thing,

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.000
are really significant.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000
It's the ideas.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000
It's the institutions.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.000
This must be true

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.000
because a Scotsman said it.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:43.000
And I think I'm the only Scotsman here at the Edinburgh TED.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.000
So let me just explain to you

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.000
that the smartest man ever was a Scotsman.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.000
He was Adam Smith --

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.000
not Billy Connolly, not Sean Connery --

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.000
though he is very smart indeed.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.000
(Laughter)

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000
Smith -- and I want you to go

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:04.000
and bow down before his statue in the Royal Mile;

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.000
it's a wonderful statue --

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.000
Smith, in the "Wealth of Nations"

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.000
published in 1776 --

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.000
that's the most important thing that happened that year ...

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:16.000
(Laughter)

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:19.000
You bet.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:22.000
There was a little local difficulty in some of our minor colonies, but ...

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.000
(Laughter)

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.000
"China seems to have been long stationary,

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.000
and probably long ago acquired that full complement of riches

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:33.000
which is consistent with the nature of its laws and institutions.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.000
But this complement may be much inferior

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.000
to what, with other laws and institutions,

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.000
the nature of its soil, climate, and situation

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.000
might admit of."

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.000
That is so right and so cool.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:47.000
And he said it such a long time ago.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:50.000
But you know, this is a TED audience,

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000
and if I keep talking about institutions,

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000
you're going to turn off.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.000
So I'm going to translate this into language that you can understand.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:02.000
Let's call them the killer apps.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:05.000
I want to explain to you that there were six killer apps

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:08.000
that set the West apart from the rest.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.000
And they're kind of like the apps on your phone,

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000
in the sense that they look quite simple.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.000
They're just icons; you click on them.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:17.000
But behind the icon, there's complex code.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.000
It's the same with institutions.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.000
There are six

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:24.000
which I think explain the Great Divergence.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000
One, competition.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000
Two, the scientific revolution.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.000
Three, property rights.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000
Four, modern medicine.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.000
Five, the consumer society.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.000
And six, the work ethic.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.000
You can play a game and try and think of one I've missed at,

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:41.000
or try and boil it down to just four,

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.000
but you'll lose.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.000
(Laughter)

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:48.000
Let me very briefly tell you what I mean by this,

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.000
synthesizing the work of many economic historians

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.000
in the process.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.000
Competition means,

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.000
not only were there a hundred different political units in Europe in 1500,

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.000
but within each of these units,

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:03.000
there was competition between corporations as well as sovereigns.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:06.000
The ancestor of the modern corporation, the City of London Corporation,

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.000
existed in the 12th century.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.000
Nothing like this existed in China,

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.000
where there was one monolithic state

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.000
covering a fifth of humanity,

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.000
and anyone with any ambition

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.000
had to pass one standardized examination,

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.000
which took three days and was very difficult

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:23.000
and involved memorizing vast numbers of characters

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:27.000
and very complex Confucian essay writing.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:30.000
The scientific revolution was different

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:33.000
from the science that had been achieved in the Oriental world

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.000
in a number of crucial ways,

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.000
the most important being

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.000
that, through the experimental method,

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:42.000
it gave men control over nature in a way that had not been possible before.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:46.000
Example: Benjamin Robins's extraordinary application

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:49.000
of Newtonian physics to ballistics.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.000
Once you do that,

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:54.000
your artillery becomes accurate.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.000
Think of what that means.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.000
That really was a killer application.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:01.000
(Laughter)

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:04.000
Meanwhile, there's no scientific revolution anywhere else.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.000
The Ottoman Empire's not that far from Europe,

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.000
but there's no scientific revolution there.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:11.000
In fact, they demolish Taqi al-Din's observatory,

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.000
because it's considered blasphemous

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:16.000
to inquire into the mind of God.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:19.000
Property rights: It's not the democracy, folks;

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:22.000
it's having the rule of law based on private property rights.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.000
That's what makes the difference

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.000
between North America and South America.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.000
You could turn up in North America

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.000
having signed a deed of indenture

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.000
saying, "I'll work for nothing for five years.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.000
You just have to feed me."

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:37.000
But at the end of it, you've got a hundred acres of land.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.000
That's the land grant

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.000
on the bottom half of the slide.

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:44.000
That's not possible in Latin America

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.000
where land is held onto

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.000
by a tiny elite descended from the conquistadors.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.000
And you can see here the huge divergence

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:53.000
that happens in property ownership between North and South.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.000
Most people in rural North America

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:58.000
owned some land by 1900.

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.000
Hardly anyone in South America did.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:03.000
That's another killer app.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:05.000
Modern medicine in the late 19th century

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:07.000
began to make major breakthroughs

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.000
against the infectious diseases that killed a lot of people.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.000
And this was another killer app --

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.000
the very opposite of a killer,

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:16.000
because it doubled, and then more than doubled, human life expectancy.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.000
It even did that

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.000
in the European empires.

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.000
Even in places like Senegal,

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.000
beginning in the early 20th century,

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.000
there were major breakthroughs in public health,

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.000
and life expectancy began to rise.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.000
It doesn't rise any faster

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.000
after these countries become independent.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.000
The empires weren't all bad.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.000
The consumer society is what you need

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:39.000
for the Industrial Revolution to have a point.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.000
You need people to want to wear tons of clothes.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:43.000
You've all bought an article of clothing in the last month;

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.000
I guarantee it.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:47.000
That's the consumer society,

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.000
and it propels economic growth

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:52.000
more than even technological change itself.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.000
Japan was the first non-Western society

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.000
to embrace it.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.000
The alternative,

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.000
which was proposed by Mahatma Gandhi,

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:03.000
was to institutionalize and make poverty permanent.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:05.000
Very few Indians today

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:07.000
wish that India had gone down

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:10.000
Mahatma Gandhi's road.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.000
Finally, the work ethic.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:15.000
Max Weber thought that was peculiarly Protestant.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:17.000
He was wrong.

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:19.000
Any culture can get the work ethic

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:21.000
if the institutions are there

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:23.000
to create the incentive to work.

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:25.000
We know this

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.000
because today the work ethic

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:30.000
is no longer a Protestant, Western phenomenon.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:33.000
In fact, the West has lost its work ethic.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:36.000
Today, the average Korean

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:40.000
works a thousand hours more a year

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:42.000
than the average German --

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:44.000
a thousand.

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:46.000
And this is part

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:49.000
of a really extraordinary phenomenon,

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:52.000
and that is the end of the Great Divergence.

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.000
Who's got the work ethic now?

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:57.000
Take a look at mathematical attainment

00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:59.000
by 15 year-olds.

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.000
At the top of the international league table

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:04.000
according to the latest PISA study,

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:06.000
is the Shanghai district of China.

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.000
The gap between Shanghai

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:11.000
and the United Kingdom and the United States

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:14.000
is as big as the gap between the U.K. and the U.S.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:17.000
and Albania and Tunisia.

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:19.000
You probably assume

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:21.000
that because the iPhone was designed in California

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.000
but assembled in China

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:26.000
that the West still leads in terms of technological innovation.

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:28.000
You're wrong.

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.000
In terms of patents,

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.000
there's no question that the East is ahead.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:35.000
Not only has Japan been ahead for some time,

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:38.000
South Korea has gone into third place,

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:41.000
and China is just about to overtake Germany.

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:43.000
Why?

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:45.000
Because the killer apps can be downloaded.

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.000
It's open source.

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:49.000
Any society can adopt these institutions,

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:51.000
and when they do,

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:55.000
they achieve what the West achieved after 1500 --

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.000
only faster.

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:59.000
This is the Great Reconvergence,

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:03.000
and it's the biggest story of your lifetime.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:06.000
Because it's on your watch that this is happening.

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:08.000
It's our generation

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:10.000
that is witnessing the end of Western predominance.

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:12.000
The average American used to be more than 20 times richer

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:14.000
than the average Chinese.

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.000
Now it's just five times,

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.000
and soon it will be 2.5 times.

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:21.000
So I want to end with three questions

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:23.000
for the future billions,

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:26.000
just ahead of 2016,

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.000
when the United States will lose its place

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:31.000
as number one economy to China.

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:35.000
The first is, can you delete these apps,

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:37.000
and are we in the process of doing so

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.000
in the Western world?

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:41.000
The second question is,

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:45.000
does the sequencing of the download matter?

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:50.000
And could Africa get that sequencing wrong?

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:52.000
One obvious implication of modern economic history

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:55.000
is that it's quite hard to transition to democracy

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:57.000
before you've established

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:00.000
secure private property rights.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:03.000
Warning: that may not work.

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:05.000
And third, can China do without

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:07.000
killer app number three?

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:11.000
That's the one that John Locke systematized

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:15.000
when he said that freedom was rooted in private property rights

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:17.000
and the protection of law.

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:19.000
That's the basis

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:21.000
for the Western model

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:24.000
of representative government.

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:26.000
Now this picture shows the demolition

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:29.000
of the Chinese artist Ai Weiwei's studio

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:31.000
in Shanghai earlier this year.

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:33.000
He's now free again,

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:35.000
having been detained, as you know, for some time.

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:38.000
But I don't think his studio has been rebuilt.

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:44.000
Winston Churchill once defined civilization

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:48.000
in a lecture he gave in the fateful year of 1938.

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:51.000
And I think these words really nail it:

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:55.000
"It means a society based upon the opinion of civilians.

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:58.000
It means that violence, the rule of warriors and despotic chiefs,

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:01.000
the conditions of camps and warfare, of riot and tyranny,

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:04.000
give place to parliaments where laws are made,

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:06.000
and independent courts of justice

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:09.000
in which over long periods those laws are maintained.

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:11.000
That is civilization --

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:13.000
and in its soil grow continually

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:16.000
freedom, comfort and culture,"

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:20.000
what all TEDsters care about most.

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:23.000
"When civilization reigns in any country,

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:26.000
a wider and less harassed life

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:29.000
is afforded to the masses of the people."

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:32.000
That's so true.

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:36.000
I don't think the decline of Western civilization

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:38.000
is inevitable,

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:41.000
because I don't think history operates

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:43.000
in this kind of life-cycle model,

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:45.000
beautifully illustrated by Thomas Cole's

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:48.000
"Course of Empire" paintings.

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:51.000
That's not the way history works.

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:53.000
That's not the way the West rose,

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:56.000
and I don't think it's the way the West will fall.

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:59.000
The West may collapse very suddenly.

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:02.000
Complex civilizations do that,

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:04.000
because they operate, most of the time,

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:06.000
on the edge of chaos.

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:09.000
That's one of the most profound insights

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:12.000
to come out of the historical study of complex institutions

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:15.000
like civilizations.

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:17.000
No, we may hang on,

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:21.000
despite the huge burdens of debt that we've accumulated,

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:24.000
despite the evidence that we've lost our work ethic

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:27.000
and other parts of our historical mojo.

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:29.000
But one thing is for sure,

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:31.000
the Great Divergence

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:33.000
is over, folks.

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:35.000
Thanks very much.

00:17:35.000 --> 00:18:00.000
(Applause)

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:02.000
Bruno Giussani: Niall,

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:04.000
I am just curious

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:07.000
about your take on the other region of the world that's booming,

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:10.000
which is Latin America.

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:13.000
What's your view on that?

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:15.000
Niall Ferguson: Well I really am not just talking

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:17.000
about the rise of the East;

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:19.000
I'm talking about the rise of the Rest,

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:21.000
and that includes South America.

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:23.000
I once asked one of my colleagues at Harvard,

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:25.000
"Hey, is South America part of the West?"

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:27.000
He was an expert in Latin American history.

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:29.000
He said, "I don't know; I'll have to think about that."

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:31.000
That tells you something really important.

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:33.000
I think if you look at what is happening in Brazil in particular,

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:35.000
but also Chile,

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:38.000
which was in many ways the one that led the way

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:41.000
in transforming the institutions of economic life,

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:44.000
there's a very bright future indeed.

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:46.000
So my story really is

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:49.000
as much about that convergence in the Americas

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:51.000
as it's a convergence story in Eurasia.

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:53.000
BG: And there is this impression

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:55.000
that North America and Europe

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:57.000
are not really paying attention

00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:59.000
to these trends.

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:02.000
Mostly they're worried about each other.

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:05.000
The Americans think that the European model is going to crumble tomorrow.

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:08.000
The Europeans think that the American budget is going to explode tomorrow.

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:11.000
And that's all we seem to be caring about recently.

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:13.000
NF: I think the fiscal crisis

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:16.000
that we see in the developed World right now -- both sides of the Atlantic --

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:18.000
is essentially the same thing

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:20.000
taking different forms

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:22.000
in terms of political culture.

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:26.000
And it's a crisis that has its structural facet --

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:28.000
it's partly to do with demographics.

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:31.000
But it's also, of course, to do with the massive crisis

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:33.000
that followed excessive leverage,

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:35.000
excessive borrowing in the private sector.

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:37.000
That crisis,

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:40.000
which has been the focus of so much attention, including by me,

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:42.000
I think is an epiphenomenon.

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:45.000
The financial crisis is really a relatively small historic phenomenon,

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:47.000
which has just accelerated

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:49.000
this huge shift,

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:51.000
which ends half a millennium of Western ascendancy.

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:53.000
I think that's its real importance.

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:55.000
BG: Niall, thank you. (NF: Thank you very much, Bruno.)

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:58.000
(Applause)
