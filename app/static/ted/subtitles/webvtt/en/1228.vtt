00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
I am a reformed marketer,

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
and I now work in international development.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
In October, I spent some time in the Democratic Republic of Congo,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
which is the [second] largest country in Africa.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
In fact, it's as large as Western Europe,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
but it only has 300 miles of paved roads.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
The DRC is a dangerous place.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
In the past 10 years, five million people have died

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
due to a war in the east.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
But war isn't the only reason

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
that life is difficult in the DRC.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
There are many health issues as well.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
In fact, the HIV prevalence rate

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
is 1.3 percent among adults.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
This might not sound like a large number,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
but in a country with 76 million people,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
it means there are 930,000 that are infected.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
And due to the poor infrastructure,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
only 25 percent of those

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
are receiving the life-saving drugs that they need.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
Which is why, in part,

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
donor agencies provide condoms

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
at low or no cost.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
And so while I was in the DRC,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
I spent a lot of time talking to people about condoms,

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
including Damien.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
Damien runs a hotel outside of Kinshasa.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
It's a hotel that's only open until midnight,

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
so it's not a place that you stay.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.000
But it is a place where sex workers and their clients come.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
Now Damien knows all about condoms,

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
but he doesn't sell them.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
He said there's just not in demand.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
It's not surprising,

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
because only three percent of people in the DRC

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
use condoms.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
Joseph and Christine,

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
who run a pharmacy where they sell a number of these condoms,

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.000
said despite the fact that donor agencies provide them at low or no cost,

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
and they have marketing campaigns that go along with them,

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
their customers don't buy the branded versions.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
They like the generics.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
And as a marketer, I found that curious.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
And so I started to look at what the marketing looked like.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
And it turns out that there are three main messages

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.000
used by the donor agencies for these condoms:

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.000
fear, financing and fidelity.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.000
They name the condoms things like Vive, "to live"

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
or Trust.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
They package it with the red ribbon

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
that reminds us of HIV,

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.000
put it in boxes that remind you who paid for them,

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
show pictures of your wife or husband

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
and tell you to protect them

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000
or to act prudently.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000
Now these are not the kinds of things that someone is thinking about

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
just before they go get a condom.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.000
(Laughter)

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
What is it that you think about

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
just before you get a condom?

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
Sex!

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
And the private companies that sell condoms in these places,

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
they understand this.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000
Their marketing is slightly different.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
The name might not be much different,

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
but the imagery sure is.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
Some brands are aspirational,

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.000
and certainly the packaging is incredibly provocative.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
And this made me think

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
that perhaps the donor agencies had just missed out

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
on a key aspect of marketing:

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000
understanding who's the audience.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000
And for donor agencies, unfortunately,

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
the audience tends to be

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000
people that aren't even in the country they're working [in].

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
It's people back home,

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
people that support their work,

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000
people like these.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
But if what we're really trying to do

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000
is stop the spread of HIV,

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
we need to think about the customer,

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.000
the people whose behavior needs to change --

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
the couples,

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000
the young women, the young men --

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000
whose lives depend on it.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000
And so the lesson is this:

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.000
it doesn't really matter what you're selling;

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.000
you just have to think about who is your customer,

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000
and what are the messages

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000
that are going to get them to change their behavior.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000
It might just save their lives.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000
Thank you.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.000
(Applause)
