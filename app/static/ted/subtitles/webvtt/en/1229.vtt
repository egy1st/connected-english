00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Everyone's familiar with cancer,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
but we don't normally think of cancer

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
as being a contagious disease.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
The Tasmanian devil has shown us

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
that, not only can cancer be a contagious disease,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
but it can also threaten

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
an entire species with extinction.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
So first of all, what is a Tasmanian devil?

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Many of you might be familiar with Taz, the cartoon character,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
the one that spins around and around and around.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
But not many people know

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
that there actually is a real animal called the Tasmanian devil,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
and it's the world's largest carnivorous marsupial.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
A marsupial is a mammal with a pouch

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
like a kangaroo.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
The Tasmanian devil got its name

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
from the terrifying nocturnal scream that it makes.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:01:00.000
(Screaming)

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
(Laughter)

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
The Tasmanian devil is predominantly a scavenger,

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
and it uses its powerful jaws

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
and its sharp teeth

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
to chomp on the bones of rotting dead animals.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
[The] Tasmanian devil is found only on the island of Tasmania,

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
which is that small island

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
just to the south of the mainland of Australia.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.000
And despite their ferocious appearance,

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
Tasmanian devils are actually

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
quite adorable little animals.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
In fact, growing up in Tasmania,

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
it always was incredibly exciting

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
when we got a chance to see

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
a Tasmanian devil in the wild.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
But the Tasmanian devil population

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.000
has been undergoing a really extremely fast decline.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
And in fact, there's concern

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
that the species could go extinct in the wild

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
within 20 to 30 years.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
And the reason for that

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
is the emergence of a new disease,

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
a contagious cancer.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
The story begins in 1996

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
when a wildlife photographer took this photograph here

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
of a Tasmanian devil

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
with a large tumor on its face.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
At the time, this was thought to be a one-off.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
Animals, just like humans,

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
sometimes get strange tumors.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
However, we now believe

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000
that this is the first sighting of a new disease,

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000
which is now an epidemic spreading through Tasmania.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
The disease was first sighted

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
in the northeast of Tasmania in 1996

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
and has spread across Tasmania like a huge wave.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000
Now there's only a small part of the population,

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
which remains unaffected.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000
This disease appears first as tumors,

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
usually on the face or inside the mouth

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
of affected Tasmanian devils.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000
These tumors inevitably grow into larger tumors,

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
such as these ones here.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
And the next image I'm going to show

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
is quite gruesome.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
But inevitably, these tumors progress

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:01.000
towards being enormous, ulcerating tumors like this one here.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000
This one in particular sticks in my mind,

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000
because this is the first case of this disease

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000
that I saw myself.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000
And I remember the horror of seeing this little female devil

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000
with this huge ulcerating, foul-smelling tumor

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
inside her mouth

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.000
that had actually cracked off her entire lower jaw.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000
She hadn't eaten for days.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000
Her guts were swimming with parasitic worms.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.000
Her body was riddled with secondary tumors.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.000
And yet, she was feeding three little baby Tasmanian devils

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.000
in her pouch.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000
Of course, they died along with the mother.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000
They were too young to survive without their mother.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.000
In fact, in the area where she comes from,

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.000
more than 90 percent of the Tasmanian devil population

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000
has already died of this disease.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000
Scientists around the world

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000
were intrigued by this cancer,

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000
this infectious cancer,

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.000
that was spreading through the Tasmanian devil population.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.000
And our minds immediately turned to cervical cancer in women,

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
which is spread by a virus,

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000
and to the AIDS epidemic,

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.000
which is associated with a number of different types of cancer.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.000
All the evidence suggested that this devil cancer

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.000
was spread by a virus.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.000
However, we now know -- and I'll tell you right now --

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.000
that we know that this cancer is not spread by a virus.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:23.000
In fact, the infectious agent of disease in this cancer

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.000
is something altogether more sinister,

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.000
and something that we hadn't really thought of before.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000
But in order for me to explain what that is,

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000
I need to spend just a couple of minutes

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000
talking more about cancer itself.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000
Cancer is a disease

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.000
that affects millions of people around the world every year.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000
One in three people in this room

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.000
will develop cancer at some stage in their lives.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000
I myself had a tumor removed from my large intestine

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.000
when I was only 14.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000
Cancer occurs

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000
when a single cell in your body

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.000
acquires a set of random mutations in important genes

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.000
that cause that cell to start to produce

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:05.000
more and more and more copies of itself.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.000
Paradoxically, once established,

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000
natural selection actually favors

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000
the continued growth of cancer.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.000
Natural selection is survival of the fittest.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000
And when you have a population of fast-dividing cancer cells,

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000
if one of them acquires new mutations,

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000
which allow them to grow more quickly,

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000
acquire nutrients more successfully,

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000
invade the body,

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.000
they'll be selected for by evolution.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:33.000
That's why cancer is such a difficult disease to treat.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.000
It evolves.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000
Throw a drug at it,

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.000
and resistant cells will grow back.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000
An amazing fact is that,

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.000
given the right environment and the right nutrients,

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000
a cancer cell has the potential

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.000
to go on growing forever.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000
However cancer is constrained

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.000
by living inside our bodies,

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000
and its continued growth,

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000
its spreading through our bodies

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000
and eating away at our tissues,

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000
leads to the death of the cancer patient

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:07.000
and also to the death of the cancer itself.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.000
So cancer could be thought of

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:14.000
as a strange, short-lived, self-destructive life form --

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.000
an evolutionary dead end.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000
But that is where the Tasmanian devil cancer

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.000
has acquired an absolutely amazing

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.000
evolutionary adaptation.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000
And the answer came from studying

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000
the Tasmanian devil cancer's DNA.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000
This was work from many people,

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000
but I'm going to explain it through a confirmatory experiment

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000
that I did a few years ago.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.000
The next slide is going to be gruesome.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.000
This is Jonas.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.000
He's a Tasmanian devil that we found

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.000
with a large tumor on his face.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.000
And being a geneticist,

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.000
I'm always interested to look at DNA and mutations.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000
So I took this opportunity

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000
to collect some samples from Jonas' tumor

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.000
and also some samples from other parts of his body.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000
I took these back to the lab.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000
I extracted DNA from them.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.000
And when I looked at the sequence of the DNA,

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:08.000
and compared the sequence of Jonas' tumor

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.000
to that of the rest of his body,

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:15.000
I discovered that they had a completely different genetic profile.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.000
In fact, Jonas and his tumor

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.000
were as different from each other

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:23.000
as you and the person sitting next to you.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:26.000
What this told us was that Jonas' tumor

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.000
did not arise from cells of his own body.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:32.000
In fact, more genetic profiling

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.000
told us that this tumor in Jonas

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000
actually probably first arose

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.000
from the cells of a female Tasmanian devil --

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.000
and Jonas was clearly a male.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.000
So how come

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:45.000
a tumor that arose from the cells of another individual

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.000
is growing on Jonas' face?

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.000
Well the next breakthrough

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:53.000
came from studying hundreds of Tasmanian devil cancers

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.000
from all around Tasmania.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.000
We found that all of these cancers

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.000
shared the same DNA.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.000
Think about that for a minute.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.000
That means that all of these cancers

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.000
actually are the same cancer

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:08.000
that arose once from one individual devil,

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:11.000
that have broken free of that first devil's body

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:15.000
and spread through the entire Tasmanian devil population.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.000
But how can a cancer spread in a population?

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.000
Well the final piece of the puzzle came

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:23.000
when we remember how devils behave when they meet each other in the wild.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.000
They tend to bite each other,

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:28.000
often quite ferociously and usually on the face.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.000
We think that cancer cells

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:34.000
actually come off the tumor, get into the saliva.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.000
When the devil bites another devil,

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.000
it actually physically implants living cancer cells into the next devil,

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.000
so the tumor continues to grow.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.000
So this Tasmanian devil cancer

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.000
is perhaps the ultimate cancer.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:48.000
It's not constrained by living within the body that gave rise to it.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000
It spreads through the population,

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:53.000
has mutations that allow it to evade the immune system,

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.000
and it's the only cancer that we know of

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:59.000
that's threatening an entire species with extinction.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:02.000
But if this can happen in Tasmanian devils,

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000
why hasn't it happened in other animals

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.000
or even humans?

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:10.000
Well the answer is, it has.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.000
This is Kimbo.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:16.000
He's a dog that belongs to a family in Mombasa in Kenya.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:19.000
Last year, his owner noticed some blood

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:22.000
trickling from his genital region.

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.000
She took him to the vet

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:27.000
and the vet discovered something quite disgusting.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:30.000
And if you're squeamish, please look away now.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.000
He discovered this,

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.000
a huge bleeding tumor

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:37.000
at the base of Kimbo's penis.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:41.000
The vet diagnosed this as transmissible venereal tumor,

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:44.000
a sexually transmitted cancer

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.000
that affects dogs.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:49.000
And just as the Tasmanian devil cancer is contagious

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.000
through the spread of living cancer cells,

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.000
so is this dog cancer.

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.000
But this dog cancer is quite remarkable,

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.000
because it spread all around the world.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.000
And in fact, these same cells

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:02.000
that are affecting Kimbo here

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.000
are also found affecting dogs

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.000
in New York City,

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.000
in mountain villages in the Himalayas

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:11.000
and in Outback Australia.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.000
We also believe this cancer might be very old.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.000
In fact, genetic profiling tells

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:18.000
that it may be tens of thousands of years old,

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.000
which means that this cancer

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.000
may have first arisen

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.000
from the cells of a wolf

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:27.000
that lived alongside the Neanderthals.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.000
This cancer is remarkable.

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:33.000
It's the oldest mammalian-derived life form that we know of.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.000
It's a living relic

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:38.000
of the distant past.

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.000
So we've seen that this can happen in animals.

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:46.000
Could cancers be contagious between people?

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.000
Well this is a question

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.000
which fascinated Chester Southam,

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:53.000
a cancer doctor in the 1950s.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:56.000
Ad he decided to put this to the test

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:59.000
by actually deliberately inoculating people

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:02.000
with cancer from somebody else.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:06.000
And this is a photograph of Dr. Southam in 1957

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:09.000
injecting cancer into a volunteer,

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.000
who in this case was an inmate

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:14.000
in Ohio State Penitentiary.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.000
Most of the people that Dr. Southam injected

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.000
did not go on to develop cancer

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.000
from the injected cells.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.000
But a small number of them did,

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:26.000
and they were mostly people who were otherwise ill --

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:29.000
whose immune systems were probably compromised.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:33.000
What this tells us,

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.000
ethical issues aside,

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:37.000
is that ...

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.000
(Laughter)

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:42.000
it's probably extremely rare

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:45.000
for cancers to be transferred between people.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.000
However, under some circumstances,

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:51.000
it can happen.

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.000
And I think that this is something

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.000
that oncologists and epidemiologists

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:58.000
should be aware of in the future.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.000
So just finally,

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.000
cancer is an inevitable outcome

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.000
of the ability of our cells

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.000
to divide

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:09.000
and to adapt to their environments.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:12.000
But that does not mean that we should give up hope

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.000
in the fight against cancer.

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.000
In fact, I believe, given more knowledge

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:19.000
of the complex evolutionary processes that drive cancer's growth,

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:22.000
we can defeat cancer.

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:24.000
My personal aim

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:28.000
is to defeat the Tasmanian devil cancer.

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.000
Let's prevent the Tasmanian devil

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.000
from being the first animal

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.000
to go extinct from cancer.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.000
Thank you.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:42.000
(Applause)
