00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Basically, there's a major demographic event going on.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
And it may be that passing the 50 percent urban point

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:15.000
is an economic tipping point. So the world now is a map of connectivity.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000
It used to be that Paris and London and New York were the largest cities.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:26.000
What we have now is the end of the rise of the West. That's over.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
The aggregate numbers are overwhelming.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:34.000
So what's really going on? Well, villages of the world are emptying out.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
The question is, why?

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.000
And here's the unromantic truth -- and the city air makes you free,

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
they said in Renaissance Germany. So some people go to places

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:56.000
like Shanghai but most go to the squatter cities where aesthetics rule.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
And these are not really a people oppressed by poverty.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
They're people getting out of poverty as fast as they can.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000
They're the dominant builders and to a large extent, the dominant designers.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
They have home-brewed infrastructure and vibrant urban life.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.000
One-sixth of the GDP in India is coming out of Mumbai.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
They are constantly upgrading, and in a few cases, the government helps.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
Education is the main event that can happen in cities.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
What's going on in the street in Mumbai?

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:28.000
Al Gore knows. It's basically everything.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
There's no unemployment in squatter cities. Everyone works.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.000
One-sixth of humanity is there. It's soon going to be more than that.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
So here's the first punch line:

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:54.000
cities have defused the population bomb.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.000
And here's the second punch line.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
That's the news from downtown. Here it is in perspective.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
Stars have shined down on earth's life for billions of years.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
Now we're shining right back up.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
Thank you.
