00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
So I just want to tell you my story.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
I spend a lot of time

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
teaching adults how to use visual language

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
and doodling in the workplace.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
And naturally, I encounter a lot of resistance,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
because it's considered to be anti-intellectual

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
and counter to serious learning.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
But I have a problem with that belief,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
because I know that doodling has a profound impact

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
on the way that we can process information

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
and the way that we can solve problems.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
So I was curious about why there was a disconnect

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
between the way our society perceives doodling

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
and the way that the reality is.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
So I discovered some very interesting things.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
For example, there's no such thing

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
as a flattering definition of a doodle.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
In the 17th century, a doodle was a simpleton or a fool --

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
as in Yankee Doodle.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
In the 18th century, it became a verb,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
and it meant to swindle or ridicule or to make fun of someone.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
In the 19th century, it was a corrupt politician.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
And today, we have what is perhaps our most offensive definition,

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
at least to me, which is the following:

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
To doodle officially means

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
to dawdle,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
to dilly dally, to monkey around,

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
to make meaningless marks,

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
to do something of little value, substance or import,

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
and -- my personal favorite --

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
to do nothing.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
No wonder people are averse to doodling at work.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
Doing nothing at work is akin to masturbating at work;

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
it's totally inappropriate.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
(Laughter)

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
Additionally, I've heard horror stories

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
from people whose teachers scolded them, of course, for doodling in classrooms.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
And they have bosses who scold them for doodling in the boardroom.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
There is a powerful cultural norm against doodling

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
in settings in which we are supposed to learn something.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
And unfortunately,

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
the press tends to reinforce this norm

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
when they're reporting on a doodling scene --

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
of an important person at a confirmation hearing and the like --

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
they typically use words like "discovered"

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
or "caught" or "found out,"

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
as if there's some sort of criminal act being committed.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
And additionally, there is a psychological aversion to doodling --

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
thank you, Freud.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
In the 1930s, Freud told us all

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
that you could analyze people's psyches

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
based on their doodles.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
This is not accurate, but it did happen to Tony Blair

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
at the Davos Forum in 2005,

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000
when his doodles were, of course, "discovered"

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000
and he was labeled the following things.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.000
Now it turned out to be Bill Gates' doodle.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
(Laughter)

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000
And Bill, if you're here, nobody thinks you're megalomaniacal.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
But that does contribute

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
to people not wanting to share their doodles.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000
And here is the real deal. Here's what I believe.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
I think that our culture

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
is so intensely focused on verbal information

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000
that we're almost blinded to the value of doodling.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000
And I'm not comfortable with that.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000
And so because of that belief that I think needs to be burst,

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
I'm here to send us all hurtling back to the truth.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
And here's the truth:

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
doodling is an incredibly powerful tool,

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000
and it is a tool that we need to remember and to re-learn.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.000
So here's a new definition for doodling.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
And I hope there's someone in here from The Oxford English Dictionary,

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
because I want to talk to you later.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
Here's the real definition:

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000
Doodling is really to make spontaneous marks to help yourself think.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000
That is why millions of people doodle.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
Here's another interesting truth about the doodle:

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
People who doodle when they're exposed to verbal information

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000
retain more of that information

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000
than their non-doodling counterparts.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000
We think doodling is something you do when you lose focus,

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000
but in reality, it is a preemptive measure

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.000
to stop you from losing focus.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000
Additionally, it has a profound effect

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
on creative problem-solving

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000
and deep information processing.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
There are four ways that learners intake information

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000
so that they can make decisions.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000
They are visual, auditory,

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000
reading and writing and kinesthetic.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000
Now in order for us to really chew on information

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000
and do something with it,

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.000
we have to engage at least two of those modalities,

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000
or we have to engage one of those modalities

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000
coupled with an emotional experience.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.000
The incredible contribution of the doodle

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.000
is that it engages all four learning modalities simultaneously

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.000
with the possibility of an emotional experience.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
That is a pretty solid contribution

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.000
for a behavior equated with doing nothing.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000
This is so nerdy,

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000
but this made me cry when I discovered this.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000
So they did anthropological research

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.000
into the unfolding of artistic activity in children,

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000
and they found that, across space and time,

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000
all children exhibit the same evolution in visual logic

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000
as they grow.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000
In other words, they have a shared and growing

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000
complexity in visual language

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000
that happens in a predictable order.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
And I think that is incredible.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
I think that means doodling is native to us

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000
and we simply are denying ourselves that instinct.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000
And finally, a lot a people aren't privy to this,

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000
but the doodle is a precursor

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000
to some of our greatest cultural assets.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000
This is but one:

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.000
this is Frank Gehry the architect's precursor to the Guggenheim in Abu Dhabi.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000
So here is my point:

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.000
Under no circumstances should doodling be eradicated

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
from a classroom or a boardroom

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000
or even the war room.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000
On the contrary,

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.000
doodling should be leveraged in precisely those situations

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000
where information density is very high

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.000
and the need for processing that information is very high.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000
And I will go you one further.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000
Because doodling is so universally accessible

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000
and it is not intimidating as an art form,

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000
it can be leveraged as a portal

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000
through which we move people

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000
into higher levels of visual literacy.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000
My friends, the doodle has never been

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000
the nemesis of intellectual thought.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000
In reality, it is one of its greatest allies.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000
Thank you.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.000
(Applause)
