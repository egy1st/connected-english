00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
A few months ago,

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
a 40 year-old woman came to an emergency room

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
in a hospital close to where I live,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
and she was brought in confused.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Her blood pressure was an alarming

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
230 over 170.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Within a few minutes, she went into cardiac collapse.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
She was resuscitated, stabilized,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
whisked over to a CAT scan suite

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
right next to the emergency room,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
because they were concerned about blood clots in the lung.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
And the CAT scan revealed

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
no blood clots in the lung,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.000
but it showed bilateral, visible, palpable breast masses,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
breast tumors,

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
that had metastasized widely

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
all over the body.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
And the real tragedy was, if you look through her records,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
she had been seen

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
in four or five other health care institutions

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
in the preceding two years.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
Four or five opportunities

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
to see the breast masses, touch the breast mass,

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
intervene at a much earlier stage

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
than when we saw her.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
Ladies and gentlemen,

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
that is not an unusual story.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
Unfortunately, it happens all the time.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
I joke, but I only half joke,

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
that if you come to one of our hospitals missing a limb,

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
no one will believe you till they get a CAT scan, MRI

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
or orthopedic consult.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
I am not a Luddite.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
I teach at Stanford.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
I'm a physician practicing with cutting-edge technology.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
But I'd like to make the case to you

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
in the next 17 minutes

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.000
that when we shortcut the physical exam,

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
when we lean towards ordering tests

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
instead of talking to and examining the patient,

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
we not only overlook simple diagnoses

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
that can be diagnosed at a treatable, early stage,

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
but we're losing much more than that.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
We're losing a ritual.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
We're losing a ritual that I believe is transformative, transcendent,

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
and is at the heart

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
of the patient-physician relationship.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
This may actually be heresy to say this at TED,

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
but I'd like to introduce you

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
to the most important innovation,

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
I think, in medicine

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
to come in the next 10 years,

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
and that is the power of the human hand --

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
to touch, to comfort, to diagnose

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
and to bring about treatment.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000
I'd like to introduce you first to this person

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
whose image you may or may not recognize.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
This is Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
Since we're in Edinburgh, I'm a big fan of Conan Doyle.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
You might not know that Conan Doyle went to medical school

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
here in Edinburgh,

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
and his character, Sherlock Holmes,

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
was inspired by Sir Joseph Bell.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
Joseph Bell was an extraordinary teacher by all accounts.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
And Conan Doyle, writing about Bell,

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
described the following exchange

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000
between Bell and his students.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000
So picture Bell sitting in the outpatient department,

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
students all around him,

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
patients signing up in the emergency room

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000
and being registered and being brought in.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000
And a woman comes in with a child,

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.000
and Conan Doyle describes the following exchange.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.000
The woman says, "Good Morning."

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000
Bell says, "What sort of crossing did you have

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000
on the ferry from Burntisland?"

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000
She says, "It was good."

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000
And he says, "What did you do with the other child?"

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000
She says, "I left him with my sister at Leith."

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
And he says,

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
"And did you take the shortcut down Inverleith Row

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
to get here to the infirmary?"

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
She says, "I did."

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.000
And he says, "Would you still be working at the linoleum factory?"

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
And she says, "I am."

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000
And Bell then goes on to explain to the students.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.000
He says, "You see, when she said, 'Good morning,'

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000
I picked up her Fife accent.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.000
And the nearest ferry crossing from Fife is from Burntisland.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.000
And so she must have taken the ferry over.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000
You notice that the coat she's carrying

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000
is too small for the child who is with her,

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000
and therefore, she started out the journey with two children,

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.000
but dropped one off along the way.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000
You notice the clay on the soles of her feet.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:57.000
Such red clay is not found within a hundred miles of Edinburgh,

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
except in the botanical gardens.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.000
And therefore, she took a short cut down Inverleith Row

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000
to arrive here.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000
And finally, she has a dermatitis

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000
on the fingers of her right hand,

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000
a dermatitis that is unique

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.000
to the linoleum factory workers in Burntisland."

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000
And when Bell actually strips the patient,

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000
begins to examine the patient,

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.000
you can only imagine how much more he would discern.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.000
And as a teacher of medicine, as a student myself,

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.000
I was so inspired by that story.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000
But you might not realize

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000
that our ability to look into the body

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000
in this simple way, using our senses,

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000
is quite recent.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000
The picture I'm showing you is of Leopold Auenbrugger

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000
who, in the late 1700s,

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000
discovered percussion.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.000
And the story is that Leopold Auenbrugger

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.000
was the son of an innkeeper.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.000
And his father used to go down into the basement

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000
to tap on the sides of casks of wine

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000
to determine how much wine was left

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000
and whether to reorder.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000
And so when Auenbrugger became a physician,

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000
he began to do the same thing.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.000
He began to tap on the chests of his patients,

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000
on their abdomens.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000
And basically everything we know about percussion,

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:10.000
which you can think of as an ultrasound of its day --

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.000
organ enlargement, fluid around the heart, fluid in the lungs,

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000
abdominal changes --

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000
all of this he described in this wonderful manuscript

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.000
"Inventum Novum," "New Invention,"

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000
which would have disappeared into obscurity,

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.000
except for the fact that this physician, Corvisart,

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000
a famous French physician --

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000
famous only because he was physician to this gentleman --

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:34.000
Corvisart repopularized and reintroduced the work.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000
And it was followed a year or two later

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.000
by Laennec discovering the stethoscope.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.000
Laennec, it is said, was walking in the streets of Paris

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.000
and saw two children playing with a stick.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.000
One was scratching at the end of the stick,

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.000
another child listened at the other end.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000
And Laennec thought this would be a wonderful way

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000
to listen to the chest or listen to the abdomen

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.000
using what he called "the cylinder."

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000
Later he renamed it the stethoscope.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:01.000
And that is how stethoscope and auscultation was born.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.000
So within a few years,

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000
in the late 1800s, early 1900s,

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000
all of a sudden,

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.000
the barber surgeon had given way

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.000
to the physician who was trying to make a diagnosis.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000
If you'll recall, prior to that time,

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.000
no matter what ailed you, you went to see the barber surgeon

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000
who wound up cupping you,

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000
bleeding you, purging you.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000
And, oh yes, if you wanted,

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.000
he would give you a haircut -- short on the sides, long in the back --

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000
and pull your tooth while he was at it.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000
He made no attempt at diagnosis.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.000
In fact, some of you might well know

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.000
that the barber pole, the red and white stripes,

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.000
represents the blood bandages of the barber surgeon,

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.000
and the receptacles on either end

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.000
represent the pots in which the blood was collected.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.000
But the arrival of auscultation and percussion

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000
represented a sea change,

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:52.000
a moment when physicians were beginning to look inside the body.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:55.000
And this particular painting, I think,

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.000
represents the pinnacle, the peak, of that clinical era.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000
This is a very famous painting:

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.000
"The Doctor" by Luke Fildes.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.000
Luke Fildes was commissioned to paint this by Tate,

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.000
who then established the Tate Gallery.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.000
And Tate asked Fildes to paint a painting

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.000
of social importance.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.000
And it's interesting that Fildes picked this topic.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.000
Fildes' oldest son, Philip,

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.000
died at the age of nine on Christmas Eve

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.000
after a brief illness.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:26.000
And Fildes was so taken by the physician

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:30.000
who held vigil at the bedside for two, three nights,

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000
that he decided that he would try and depict

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.000
the physician in our time --

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000
almost a tribute to this physician.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.000
And hence the painting "The Doctor," a very famous painting.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.000
It's been on calendars, postage stamps in many different countries.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:45.000
I've often wondered, what would Fildes have done

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.000
had he been asked to paint this painting

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.000
in the modern era,

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:52.000
in the year 2011?

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:56.000
Would he have substituted a computer screen

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.000
for where he had the patient?

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000
I've gotten into some trouble in Silicon Valley

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000
for saying that the patient in the bed

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:05.000
has almost become an icon

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:08.000
for the real patient who's in the computer.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:11.000
I've actually coined a term for that entity in the computer.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.000
I call it the iPatient.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:16.000
The iPatient is getting wonderful care all across America.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.000
The real patient often wonders,

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.000
where is everyone?

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:23.000
When are they going to come by and explain things to me?

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.000
Who's in charge?

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:28.000
There's a real disjunction between the patient's perception

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.000
and our own perceptions as physicians of the best medical care.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.000
I want to show you a picture

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.000
of what rounds looked like

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.000
when I was in training.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.000
The focus was around the patient.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.000
We went from bed to bed. The attending physician was in charge.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.000
Too often these days,

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000
rounds look very much like this,

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.000
where the discussion is taking place

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.000
in a room far away from the patient.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:54.000
The discussion is all about images on the computer, data.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.000
And the one critical piece missing

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.000
is that of the patient.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:01.000
Now I've been influenced in this thinking

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:04.000
by two anecdotes that I want to share with you.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:07.000
One had to do with a friend of mine who had a breast cancer,

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:10.000
had a small breast cancer detected --

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.000
had her lumpectomy in the town in which I lived.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.000
This is when I was in Texas.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:17.000
And she then spent a lot of time researching

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:20.000
to find the best cancer center in the world

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.000
to get her subsequent care.

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:25.000
And she found the place and decided to go there, went there.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:28.000
Which is why I was surprised a few months later

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:31.000
to see her back in our own town,

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:34.000
getting her subsequent care with her private oncologist.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.000
And I pressed her, and I asked her,

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.000
"Why did you come back and get your care here?"

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.000
And she was reluctant to tell me.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:44.000
She said, "The cancer center was wonderful.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.000
It had a beautiful facility,

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.000
giant atrium, valet parking,

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.000
a piano that played itself,

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:53.000
a concierge that took you around from here to there.

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.000
But," she said,

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:59.000
"but they did not touch my breasts."

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.000
Now you and I could argue

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.000
that they probably did not need to touch her breasts.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.000
They had her scanned inside out.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:08.000
They understood her breast cancer at the molecular level;

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.000
they had no need to touch her breasts.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:13.000
But to her, it mattered deeply.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:17.000
It was enough for her to make the decision

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:20.000
to get her subsequent care with her private oncologist

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.000
who, every time she went,

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:25.000
examined both breasts including the axillary tail,

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.000
examined her axilla carefully,

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.000
examined her cervical region, her inguinal region,

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.000
did a thorough exam.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:35.000
And to her, that spoke of a kind of attentiveness that she needed.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.000
I was very influenced by that anecdote.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:40.000
I was also influenced by another experience that I had,

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:43.000
again, when I was in Texas, before I moved to Stanford.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.000
I had a reputation

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.000
as being interested in patients

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:50.000
with chronic fatigue.

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:54.000
This is not a reputation you would wish on your worst enemy.

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:57.000
I say that because these are difficult patients.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:00.000
They have often been rejected by their families,

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.000
have had bad experiences with medical care

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:05.000
and they come to you fully prepared

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:07.000
for you to join the long list of people

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.000
who's about to disappoint them.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:12.000
And I learned very early on with my first patient

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.000
that I could not do justice

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.000
to this very complicated patient

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.000
with all the records they were bringing

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.000
in a new patient visit of 45 minutes.

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.000
There was just no way.

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:25.000
And if I tried, I'd disappoint them.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.000
And so I hit on this method

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.000
where I invited the patient

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:32.000
to tell me the story for their entire first visit,

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:35.000
and I tried not to interrupt them.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:37.000
We know the average American physician

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:40.000
interrupts their patient in 14 seconds.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:42.000
And if I ever get to heaven,

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:45.000
it will be because I held my piece for 45 minutes

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:47.000
and did not interrupt my patient.

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:50.000
I then scheduled the physical exam for two weeks hence,

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.000
and when the patient came for the physical,

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.000
I was able to do a thorough physical,

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.000
because I had nothing else to do.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:59.000
I like to think that I do a thorough physical exam,

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:02.000
but because the whole visit was now about the physical,

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:05.000
I could do an extraordinarily thorough exam.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:09.000
And I remember my very first patient in that series

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:11.000
continued to tell me more history

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:14.000
during what was meant to be the physical exam visit.

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.000
And I began my ritual.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.000
I always begin with the pulse,

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:21.000
then I examine the hands, then I look at the nail beds,

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:23.000
then I slide my hand up to the epitrochlear node,

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:25.000
and I was into my ritual.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.000
And when my ritual began,

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:29.000
this very voluble patient

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:31.000
began to quiet down.

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:34.000
And I remember having a very eerie sense

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:37.000
that the patient and I

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.000
had slipped back into a primitive ritual

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:41.000
in which I had a role

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.000
and the patient had a role.

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:45.000
And when I was done,

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:47.000
the patient said to me with some awe,

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:50.000
"I have never been examined like this before."

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:52.000
Now if that were true,

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.000
it's a true condemnation of our health care system,

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:57.000
because they had been seen in other places.

00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:59.000
I then proceeded to tell the patient,

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.000
once the patient was dressed,

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:04.000
the standard things that the person must have heard in other institutions,

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:06.000
which is, "This is not in your head.

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.000
This is real.

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:11.000
The good news, it's not cancer, it's not tuberculosis,

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:14.000
it's not coccidioidomycosis or some obscure fungal infection.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:17.000
The bad news is we don't know exactly what's causing this,

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:20.000
but here's what you should do, here's what we should do."

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:23.000
And I would lay out all the standard treatment options

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:26.000
that the patient had heard elsewhere.

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:28.000
And I always felt

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.000
that if my patient gave up the quest

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:33.000
for the magic doctor, the magic treatment

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:36.000
and began with me on a course towards wellness,

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.000
it was because I had earned the right

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.000
to tell them these things

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:42.000
by virtue of the examination.

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:46.000
Something of importance had transpired in the exchange.

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.000
I took this to my colleagues

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.000
at Stanford in anthropology

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.000
and told them the same story.

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:54.000
And they immediately said to me,

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.000
"Well you are describing a classic ritual."

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:58.000
And they helped me understand

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:01.000
that rituals are all about transformation.

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:03.000
We marry, for example,

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:06.000
with great pomp and ceremony and expense

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:08.000
to signal our departure

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:10.000
from a life of solitude and misery and loneliness

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:13.000
to one of eternal bliss.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:15.000
I'm not sure why you're laughing.

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:17.000
That was the original intent, was it not?

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:19.000
We signal transitions of power

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:21.000
with rituals.

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:23.000
We signal the passage of a life with rituals.

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:25.000
Rituals are terribly important.

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:27.000
They're all about transformation.

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:29.000
Well I would submit to you

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:31.000
that the ritual

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:33.000
of one individual coming to another

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:35.000
and telling them things

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:38.000
that they would not tell their preacher or rabbi,

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:40.000
and then, incredibly on top of that,

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:43.000
disrobing and allowing touch --

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:47.000
I would submit to you that that is a ritual of exceeding importance.

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:49.000
And if you shortchange that ritual

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:51.000
by not undressing the patient,

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:54.000
by listening with your stethoscope on top of the nightgown,

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:56.000
by not doing a complete exam,

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:58.000
you have bypassed on the opportunity

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:02.000
to seal the patient-physician relationship.

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:04.000
I am a writer,

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:08.000
and I want to close by reading you a short passage that I wrote

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:10.000
that has to do very much with this scene.

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:12.000
I'm an infectious disease physician,

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:15.000
and in the early days of HIV, before we had our medications,

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:19.000
I presided over so many scenes like this.

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:22.000
I remember, every time I went to a patient's deathbed,

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:24.000
whether in the hospital or at home,

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:28.000
I remember my sense of failure --

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:30.000
the feeling of I don't know what I have to say;

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:32.000
I don't know what I can say;

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:34.000
I don't know what I'm supposed to do.

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:36.000
And out of that sense of failure,

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:39.000
I remember, I would always examine the patient.

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:41.000
I would pull down the eyelids.

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:43.000
I would look at the tongue.

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:46.000
I would percuss the chest. I would listen to the heart.

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:48.000
I would feel the abdomen.

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:51.000
I remember so many patients,

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:53.000
their names still vivid on my tongue,

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:55.000
their faces still so clear.

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:59.000
I remember so many huge, hollowed out, haunted eyes

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:02.000
staring up at me as I performed this ritual.

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:04.000
And then the next day,

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:06.000
I would come, and I would do it again.

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:09.000
And I wanted to read you this one closing passage

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:11.000
about one patient.

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:13.000
"I recall one patient

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:15.000
who was at that point

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:17.000
no more than a skeleton

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:19.000
encased in shrinking skin,

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:21.000
unable to speak,

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:23.000
his mouth crusted with candida

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:26.000
that was resistant to the usual medications.

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:28.000
When he saw me

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:30.000
on what turned out to be his last hours on this earth,

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:33.000
his hands moved as if in slow motion.

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:35.000
And as I wondered what he was up to,

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:37.000
his stick fingers made their way

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:39.000
up to his pajama shirt,

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:42.000
fumbling with his buttons.

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:44.000
I realized that he was wanting

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:47.000
to expose his wicker-basket chest to me.

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:50.000
It was an offering, an invitation.

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:52.000
I did not decline.

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:55.000
I percussed. I palpated. I listened to the chest.

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:57.000
I think he surely must have known by then

00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:59.000
that it was vital for me

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:01.000
just as it was necessary for him.

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:04.000
Neither of us could skip this ritual,

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:07.000
which had nothing to do with detecting rales in the lung,

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:10.000
or finding the gallop rhythm of heart failure.

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:13.000
No, this ritual was about the one message

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:16.000
that physicians have needed to convey to their patients.

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:18.000
Although, God knows, of late, in our hubris,

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:20.000
we seem to have drifted away.

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:22.000
We seem to have forgotten --

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:24.000
as though, with the explosion of knowledge,

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:27.000
the whole human genome mapped out at our feet,

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:29.000
we are lulled into inattention,

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:32.000
forgetting that the ritual is cathartic to the physician,

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:34.000
necessary for the patient --

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:36.000
forgetting that the ritual has meaning

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:40.000
and a singular message to convey to the patient.

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:43.000
And the message, which I didn't fully understand then,

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:45.000
even as I delivered it,

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:48.000
and which I understand better now is this:

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:51.000
I will always, always, always be there.

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:53.000
I will see you through this.

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:55.000
I will never abandon you.

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:57.000
I will be with you through the end."

00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:59.000
Thank you very much.

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:11.000
(Applause)
