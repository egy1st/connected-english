00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
What I want to talk about today is one idea.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
It's an idea for a new kind of school,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
which turns on its head much of our conventional thinking

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
about what schools are for and how they work.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
And it might just be coming to a neighborhood near you soon.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Where it comes from

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
is an organization called the Young Foundation,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
which, over many decades,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
has come up with many innovations in education, like the Open University

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
and things like Extended Schools,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Schools for Social Entrepreneurs, Summer Universities

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
and the School of Everything.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
And about five years ago, we asked

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
what was the most important need for innovation

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
in schooling here in the U.K.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
And we felt the most important priority

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
was to bring together two sets of problems.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
One was large numbers of bored teenagers

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
who just didn't like school,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
couldn't see any relationship between what they learned in school

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
and future jobs.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
And employers who kept complaining

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
that the kids coming out of school weren't actually ready for real work,

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
didn't have the right attitudes and experience.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
And so we try to ask:

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
What kind of school would have the teenagers fighting to get in,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
not fighting to stay out?

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
And after hundreds of conversations

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
with teenagers and teachers and parents

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
and employers and schools

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
from Paraguay to Australia,

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
and looking at some of the academic research,

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
which showed the importance

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
of what's now called non-cognitive skills --

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
the skills of motivation, resilience --

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
and that these are as important

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
as the cognitive skills -- formal academic skills --

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
we came up with an answer, a very simple answer in a way,

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
which we called the Studio School.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
And we called it a studio school

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.000
to go back to the original idea of a studio in the Renaissance

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
where work and learning are integrated.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
You work by learning,

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
and you learn by working.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
And the design we came up with had the following characteristics.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
First of all, we wanted small schools --

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
about 300, 400 pupils --

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
14 to 19 year-olds,

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000
and critically, about 80 percent of the curriculum done

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
not through sitting in classrooms,

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
but through real-life, practical projects,

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
working on commission

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
to businesses, NGO's and others.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
That every pupil would have a coach, as well as teachers,

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
who would have timetables

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
much more like a work environment in a business.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
And all of this will be done within the public system,

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
funded by public money,

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
but independently run.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000
And all at no extra cost, no selection,

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000
and allowing the pupils the route into university,

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000
even if many of them would want to become entrepreneurs

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
and have manual jobs as well.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
Underlying it was some very simple ideas

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
that large numbers of teenagers learn best by doing things,

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
they learn best in teams

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000
and they learn best by doing things for real --

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
all the opposite of what mainstream schooling

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
actually does.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
Now that was a nice idea,

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000
so we moved into the rapid prototyping phase.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
We tried it out,

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
first in Luton --

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
famous for its airport and not much else, I fear --

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000
and in Blackpool -- famous for its beaches and leisure.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
And what we found -- and we got quite a lot of things wrong

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
and then improved them --

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
but we found that the young people loved it.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000
They found it much more motivational, much more exciting

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
than traditional education.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
And perhaps most important of all,

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
two years later when the exam results came through,

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
the pupils who had been put on these field trials

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000
who were in the lowest performing groups

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
had jumped right to the top --

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000
in fact, pretty much at the top decile of performance

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000
in terms of GCSE's,

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.000
which is the British marking system.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000
Now not surprisingly,

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.000
that influenced some people to think we were onto something.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
The minister of education

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
down south in London

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000
described himself as a "big fan."

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.000
And the business organizations thought we were onto something

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000
in terms of a way of preparing children much better

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000
for real-life work today.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000
And indeed, the head of the Chambers of Commerce

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.000
is now the chairman of the Studio Schools Trust

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.000
and helping it, not just with big businesses,

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.000
but small businesses all over the country.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000
We started with two schools.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000
That's grown this year to about 10.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.000
And next year, we're expecting about 35 schools

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
open across England,

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000
and another 40 areas

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000
want to have their own schools opening --

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000
a pretty rapid spread

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000
of this idea.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000
Interestingly,

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.000
it's happened almost entirely without media coverage.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:18.000
It's happened almost entirely without big money behind it.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.000
It spread almost entirely through word of mouth, virally,

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000
across teachers, parents,

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000
people involved in education.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
And it spread because of the power of an idea --

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
so the very, very simple idea

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
about turning education on its head

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.000
and putting the things which were marginal,

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.000
things like working in teams, doing practical projects,

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.000
and putting them right at the heart of learning,

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.000
rather than on the edges.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000
Now there's a whole set of new schools

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000
opening up this autumn.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000
This is one from Yorkshire

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.000
where, in fact, my nephew, I hope, will be able to attend it.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000
And this one is focused

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000
on creative and media industries.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000
Other ones have a focus on health care,

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000
tourism, engineering

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000
and other fields.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000
We think we're onto something.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000
It's not perfect yet,

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000
but we think this is one idea

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000
which can transform the lives

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000
of thousands, possibly millions, of teenagers

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000
who are really bored by schooling.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000
It doesn't animate them.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.000
They're not like all of you who can sit in rows

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.000
and hear things said to you for hour after hour.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.000
They want to do things, they want to get their hands dirty,

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.000
they want education to be for real.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000
And my hope is that some of you out there

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.000
may be able to help us.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.000
We feel we're on the beginning of a journey

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.000
of experiment and improvement

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000
to turn the Studio School idea

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.000
into something which is present,

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000
not as a universal answer for every child,

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.000
but at least as an answer for some children in every part of the world.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.000
And I hope that a few of you at least can help us make that happen.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000
Thank you very much.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.000
(Applause)
