00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
I was born in Switzerland

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
and raised in Ghana, West Africa.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Ghana felt safe to me as a child.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
I was free, I was happy.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
The early 70s

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
marked a time of musical and artistic excellence in Ghana.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
But then by the end of the decade,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
the country had fallen back into political instability

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
and mismanagement.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
In 1979,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
I witnessed my first military coup.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
We the children had gathered at a friend's house.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
It was a dimly lit shack.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
There was a beaten up black and white television

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
flickering in the background,

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
and a former head of state and general

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
was being blindfolded

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
and tied to the pole.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
The firing squad aimed, fired --

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
the general was dead.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
Now this was being broadcast live.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
And shortly after, we left the country,

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
and we returned to Switzerland.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
Now Europe came as a shock to me,

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
and I think I started feeling the need

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
to shed my skin in order to fit in.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
I wanted to blend in like a chameleon.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
I think it was a tactic of survival.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
And it worked, or so I believed.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:24.000
So here I was in 2008

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
wondering where I was in my life.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
And I felt I was being typecast as an actor.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
I was always playing the exotic African.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
I was playing the violent African,

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
the African terrorist.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
And I was thinking,

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
how many terrorists could I possibly play

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
before turning into one myself?

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
And I had become ashamed of the other,

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
the African in me.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
And fortunately I decided in 2008

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
to return to Ghana,

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
after 28 years of absence.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
I wanted to document on film

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
the 2008 presidential elections.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
And there, I started by searching

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
for the footprints in my childhood.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
And before I even knew it,

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
I was suddenly on a stage

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
surrounded by thousands of cheering people

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
during a political rally.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000
And I realized that, when I'd left the country,

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000
free and fair elections in a democratic environment

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
were a dream.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
And now that I'd returned, that dream had become reality,

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
though a fragile reality.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
And I was thinking,

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
was Ghana searching for its identity

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
like I was looking for my identity?

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
Was what was happening in Ghana a metaphor

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000
for what was happening in me?

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:47.000
And it was as if through the standards of my Western life,

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000
I hadn't lived up to my full potential.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000
I mean, nor had Ghana,

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
even though we had been trying very hard.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
Now in 1957,

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
Ghana was the first sub-Saharan country

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
to gain its independence.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
In the late 50s,

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000
Ghana and Singapore had the same GDP.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000
I mean, today, Singapore is a First World country

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000
and Ghana is not.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000
But maybe it was time to prove to myself,

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
yes, it's important to understand the past,

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.000
it is important to look at it in a different light,

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.000
but maybe we should look at the strengths in our own culture

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.000
and build on those foundations in the present.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:33.000
So here I was, December 7th, 2008.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:38.000
The polling stations opened to the voters at 7:00 AM,

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.000
but voters, eager to take their own political fate into their hands,

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000
were starting to line up at 4:00 AM in the morning.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000
And they had traveled from near, they had traveled from far,

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000
because they wanted to make their voices heard.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.000
And I asked one of the voters, I said, "Whom are you going to vote for?"

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.000
And he said, "I'm sorry, I can't tell you."

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.000
He said that his vote was in his heart.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.000
And I understood, this was their election,

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000
and they weren't going to let anyone

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000
take it away from them.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000
Now the first round of the voting didn't bring forth a clear winner --

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:13.000
so nobody had achieved the absolute majority --

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.000
so voting went into a second round three weeks later.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.000
The candidates were back on the road; they were campaigning.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000
The rhetoric of the candidates, of course, changed.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000
The heat was on.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:28.000
And then the cliche came to haunt us.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
There were claims of intimidation

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
at the polling stations,

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.000
of ballot boxes being stolen.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.000
Inflated results started coming in

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.000
and the mob was starting to get out of control.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:46.000
We witnessed the eruption of violence in the streets.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.000
People were being beaten brutally.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.000
The army started firing their guns. People were scrambling.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000
It was complete chaos.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000
And my heart sank,

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000
because I thought, here we are again.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000
Here is another proof

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000
that the African is not capable of governing himself.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000
And not only that, I am documenting it --

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:10.000
documenting my own cultural shortcomings.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.000
So when the echo of the gunshots

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000
had lingered,

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000
it was soon drowned by the chanting of the mob,

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000
and I didn't believe what I was hearing.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000
They were chanting, "We want peace.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.000
We want peace."

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.000
And I realized it had to come from the people.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000
After all, they decide,

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000
and they did.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:35.000
So the sounds that were before distorted and loud,

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.000
were suddenly a melody.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.000
The sounds of the voices were harmonious.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.000
So it could happen.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.000
A democracy could be upheld peacefully.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.000
It could be, by the will of the masses

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000
who were now urgently pressing

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.000
with all their heart and all their will

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000
for peace.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.000
Now here's an interesting comparison.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000
We in the West,

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.000
we preach the values,

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.000
the golden light of democracy,

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.000
that we are the shining example of how it's done.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.000
But when it comes down to it,

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:16.000
Ghana found itself in the same place

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.000
in which the U.S. election stalled

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000
in the 2000 presidential elections --

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.000
Bush versus Gore.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.000
But instead of the unwillingness of the candidates

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.000
to allow the system to proceed and the people to decide,

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.000
Ghana honored democracy

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000
and its people.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.000
It didn't leave it up to the Supreme Court to decide;

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:40.000
the people did.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:43.000
Now the second round of voting

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.000
did not bring forth a clear winner either.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000
I mean, it was so incredibly close.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.000
The electoral commissioner declared,

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.000
with the consent of the parties,

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000
to run an unprecedented

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000
second re-run.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:00.000
So the people went back to the polls

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000
to determine their own president,

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000
not the legal system.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:08.000
And guess what, it worked.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.000
The defeated candidate

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.000
gave up power

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.000
and made way for Ghana to move into a new democratic cycle.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.000
I mean, at the absolute time

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.000
for the absolute need of democracy,

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:22.000
they did not abuse their power.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:28.000
The belief in true democracy and in the people runs deep,

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:32.000
proving that the African is capable of governing himself.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:36.000
Now the uphill battle for Ghana and for Africa

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.000
is not over,

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:42.000
but I have proof that the other side of democracy exists,

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:45.000
and that we must not take it for granted.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.000
Now I have learned

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:51.000
that my place is not just in the West or in Africa,

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.000
and I'm still searching

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.000
for my identity,

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:58.000
but I saw Ghana

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000
create democracy better.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000
Ghana taught me

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000
to look at people differently

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:07.000
and to look at myself differently.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.000
And yes,

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.000
we Africans can.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.000
Thank you.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:16.000
(Applause)
