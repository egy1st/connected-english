00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:14.000
(Music)

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
♫ I don't understand myself, ♫

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.000
♫ why they keep talking of love, ♫

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
♫ if they come near me, ♫

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:33.000
♫ if they look into my eyes and kiss my hand. ♫

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
♫ I don't understand myself, ♫

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.000
♫ why they talk of magic, ♫

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
♫ that no one withstands, ♫

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:52.000
♫ if he sees me, if he passes by. ♫

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:58.000
♫ But if the red light is on ♫

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
♫ in the middle of the night ♫

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000
♫ and everybody listens to my song, ♫

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:15.000
♫ then it is plain to see. ♫

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:24.000
♫ My lips, they give so fiery a kiss, ♫

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:33.000
♫ my limbs, they are supple and soft. ♫

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:40.000
♫ It is written for me in the stars, ♫

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:47.000
♫ thou shalt kiss, thou shalt love. ♫

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:53.000
♫ My feet, they glide and float, ♫

00:01:53.000 --> 00:02:02.000
♫ my eyes, they lure and glow. ♫

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:12.000
♫ And I dance as if entranced, 'cause I know, ♫

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:24.000
♫ my lips give so fiery a kiss. ♫

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000
♫ In my veins, ♫

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.000
♫ runs a dancer's blood, ♫

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000
♫ because my beautiful mother ♫

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000
♫ was the Queen of dance ♫

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.000
♫ in the gilded Alcazar. ♫

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000
♫ She was so very beautiful, ♫

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:26.000
♫ I often saw her in my dreams. ♫

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.000
♫ If she beat the tambourine ♫

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:39.000
♫ to her beguiling dance,
all eyes were glowing admiringly. ♫

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:44.000
♫ She reawakened in me, ♫

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000
♫ mine is the same lot. ♫

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.000
♫ I dance like her at midnight ♫

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:58.000
♫ and from deep within I feel: ♫

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:09.000
♫ My lips, they give so fiery a kiss, ♫

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:18.000
♫ my limbs, they are supple and soft. ♫

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:26.000
♫ It is written for me in the stars, ♫

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:34.000
♫ thou shalt kiss, thou shalt love. ♫

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:58.000
♫ And I dance as if entranced, 
'cause I know, ♫

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:15.000
♫ my lips give so fiery a kiss. ♫

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:33.000
(Applause)
