WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
The night before I was heading for Scotland,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
I was invited to host the final

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
of "China's Got Talent" show in Shanghai

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
with the 80,000 live audience in the stadium.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Guess who was the performing guest?

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Susan Boyle.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
And I told her, "I'm going to Scotland the next day."

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
She sang beautifully,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
and she even managed to say a few words in Chinese:

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
送你葱

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
So it's not like "hello" or "thank you,"

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
that ordinary stuff.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
It means "green onion for free."

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
Why did she say that?

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
Because it was a line

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
from our Chinese parallel Susan Boyle --

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
a 50-some year-old woman,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
a vegetable vendor in Shanghai,

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
who loves singing Western opera,

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
but she didn't understand

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
any English or French or Italian,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
so she managed to fill in the lyrics

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
with vegetable names in Chinese.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
(Laughter)

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
And the last sentence of Nessun Dorma

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
that she was singing in the stadium

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
was "green onion for free."

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
So [as] Susan Boyle was saying that,

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
80,000 live audience sang together.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
That was hilarious.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
So I guess both Susan Boyle

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
and this vegetable vendor in Shanghai

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
belonged to otherness.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
They were the least expected to be successful

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
in the business called entertainment,

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
yet their courage and talent brought them through.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
And a show and a platform

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
gave them the stage

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
to realize their dreams.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.000
Well, being different is not that difficult.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
We are all different

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
from different perspectives.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
But I think being different is good,

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
because you present a different point of view.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
You may have the chance to make a difference.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
My generation has been very fortunate

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
to witness and participate

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000
in the historic transformation of China

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
that has made so many changes

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
in the past 20, 30 years.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000
I remember that in the year of 1990,

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
when I was graduating from college,

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
I was applying for a job in the sales department

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
of the first five-star hotel in Beijing,

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.000
Great Wall Sheraton -- it's still there.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
So after being interrogated

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
by this Japanese manager for a half an hour,

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
he finally said,

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
"So, Miss Yang,

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000
do you have any questions to ask me?"

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000
I summoned my courage and poise and said,

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
"Yes, but could you let me know,

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000
what actually do you sell?"

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
I didn't have a clue what a sales department was about

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
in a five-star hotel.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000
That was the first day I set my foot

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
in a five-star hotel.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
Around the same time,

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000
I was going through an audition --

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
the first ever open audition

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000
by national television in China --

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000
with another thousand college girls.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
The producer told us

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
they were looking for some sweet, innocent

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000
and beautiful fresh face.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000
So when it was my turn, I stood up and said,

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000
"Why [do] women's personalities on television

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.000
always have to be beautiful, sweet, innocent

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.000
and, you know, supportive?

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
Why can't they have their own ideas

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
and their own voice?"

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.000
I thought I kind of offended them.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.000
But actually, they were impressed by my words.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000
And so I was in the second round of competition,

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000
and then the third and the fourth.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000
After seven rounds of competition,

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000
I was the last one to survive it.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.000
So I was on a national television prime-time show.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000
And believe it or not,

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000
that was the first show on Chinese television

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000
that allowed its hosts

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000
to speak out of their own minds

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000
without reading an approved script.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:05.000
(Applause)

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000
And my weekly audience at that time

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.000
was between 200 to 300 million people.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000
Well after a few years,

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.000
I decided to go to the U.S. and Columbia University

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000
to pursue my postgraduate studies,

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000
and then started my own media company,

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.000
which was unthought of

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.000
during the years that I started my career.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000
So we do a lot of things.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000
I've interviewed more than a thousand people in the past.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000
And sometimes I have young people approaching me

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000
say, "Lan, you changed my life,"

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000
and I feel proud of that.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000
But then we are also so fortunate

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.000
to witness the transformation of the whole country.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:46.000
I was in Beijing's bidding for the Olympic Games.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000
I was representing the Shanghai Expo.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000
I saw China embracing the world

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
and vice versa.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.000
But then sometimes I'm thinking,

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:59.000
what are today's young generation up to?

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000
How are they different,

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000
and what are the differences they are going to make

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000
to shape the future of China,

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.000
or at large, the world?

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000
So today I want to talk about young people

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.000
through the platform of social media.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.000
First of all, who are they? [What] do they look like?

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000
Well this is a girl called Guo Meimei --

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000
20 years old, beautiful.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.000
She showed off her expensive bags,

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000
clothes and car

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000
on her microblog,

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000
which is the Chinese version of Twitter.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:33.000
And she claimed to be the general manager of Red Cross

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.000
at the Chamber of Commerce.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.000
She didn't realize

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000
that she stepped on a sensitive nerve

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000
and aroused national questioning,

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.000
almost a turmoil,

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.000
against the credibility of Red Cross.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.000
The controversy was so heated

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000
that the Red Cross had to open a press conference

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.000
to clarify it,

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000
and the investigation is going on.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.000
So far, as of today,

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.000
we know that she herself made up that title --

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.000
probably because she feels proud to be associated with charity.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000
All those expensive items

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.000
were given to her as gifts

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.000
by her boyfriend,

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.000
who used to be a board member

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.000
in a subdivision of Red Cross at Chamber of Commerce.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.000
It's very complicated to explain.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.000
But anyway, the public still doesn't buy it.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000
It is still boiling.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.000
It shows us a general mistrust

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.000
of government or government-backed institutions,

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.000
which lacked transparency in the past.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.000
And also it showed us

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.000
the power and the impact of social media

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.000
as microblog.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:43.000
Microblog boomed in the year of 2010,

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.000
with visitors doubled

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.000
and time spent on it tripled.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.000
Sina.com, a major news portal,

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:54.000
alone has more than 140 million microbloggers.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000
On Tencent, 200 million.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.000
The most popular blogger --

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000
it's not me --

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000
it's a movie star,

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:06.000
and she has more than 9.5 million followers, or fans.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.000
About 80 percent of those microbloggers are young people,

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.000
under 30 years old.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.000
And because, as you know,

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.000
the traditional media is still heavily controlled by the government,

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.000
social media offers an opening

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.000
to let the steam out a little bit.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.000
But because you don't have many other openings,

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.000
the heat coming out of this opening

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.000
is sometimes very strong, active

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000
and even violent.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.000
So through microblogging,

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:37.000
we are able to understand Chinese youth even better.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.000
So how are they different?

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.000
First of all, most of them were born

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.000
in the 80s and 90s,

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:46.000
under the one-child policy.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.000
And because of selected abortion

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.000
by families who favored boys to girls,

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000
now we have ended up

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:55.000
with 30 million more young men than women.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.000
That could pose

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.000
a potential danger to the society,

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.000
but who knows;

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.000
we're in a globalized world,

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:07.000
so they can look for girlfriends from other countries.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:10.000
Most of them have fairly good education.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:13.000
The illiteracy rate in China among this generation

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:16.000
is under one percent.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:19.000
In cities, 80 percent of kids go to college.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:23.000
But they are facing an aging China

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:26.000
with a population above 65 years old

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:29.000
coming up with seven-point-some percent this year,

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000
and about to be 15 percent

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.000
by the year of 2030.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.000
And you know we have the tradition

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.000
that younger generations support the elders financially,

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.000
and taking care of them when they're sick.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.000
So it means young couples

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:44.000
will have to support four parents

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:48.000
who have a life expectancy of 73 years old.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000
So making a living is not that easy

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.000
for young people.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:55.000
College graduates are not in short supply.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.000
In urban areas,

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.000
college graduates find the starting salary

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.000
is about 400 U.S. dollars a month,

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.000
while the average rent

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.000
is above $500.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:08.000
So what do they do? They have to share space --

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.000
squeezed in very limited space

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.000
to save money --

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.000
and they call themselves "tribe of ants."

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.000
And for those who are ready to get married

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.000
and buy their apartment,

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.000
they figured out they have to work

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.000
for 30 to 40 years

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.000
to afford their first apartment.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.000
That ratio in America

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.000
would only cost a couple five years to earn,

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:32.000
but in China it's 30 to 40 years

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:36.000
with the skyrocketing real estate price.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.000
Among the 200 million migrant workers,

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:42.000
60 percent of them are young people.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:44.000
They find themselves sort of sandwiched

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:47.000
between the urban areas and the rural areas.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:50.000
Most of them don't want to go back to the countryside,

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.000
but they don't have the sense of belonging.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.000
They work for longer hours

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:57.000
with less income, less social welfare.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.000
And they're more vulnerable

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.000
to job losses,

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.000
subject to inflation,

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.000
tightening loans from banks,

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.000
appreciation of the renminbi,

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.000
or decline of demand

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.000
from Europe or America

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.000
for the products they produce.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.000
Last year, though,

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:17.000
an appalling incident

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:20.000
in a southern OEM manufacturing compound in China:

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.000
13 young workers

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.000
in their late teens and early 20s

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.000
committed suicide,

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:30.000
just one by one like causing a contagious disease.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:34.000
But they died because of all different personal reasons.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.000
But this whole incident

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.000
aroused a huge outcry from society

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.000
about the isolation,

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.000
both physical and mental,

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.000
of these migrant workers.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.000
For those who do return back to the countryside,

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:49.000
they find themselves very welcome locally,

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.000
because with the knowledge, skills and networks

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:53.000
they have learned in the cities,

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.000
with the assistance of the Internet,

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:58.000
they're able to create more jobs,

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.000
upgrade local agriculture and create new business

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.000
in the less developed market.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:05.000
So for the past few years, the coastal areas,

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:08.000
they found themselves in a shortage of labor.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.000
These diagrams show

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.000
a more general social background.

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:15.000
The first one is the Engels coefficient,

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:18.000
which explains that the cost of daily necessities

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.000
has dropped its percentage

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.000
all through the past decade,

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.000
in terms of family income,

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:27.000
to about 37-some percent.

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.000
But then in the last two years,

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.000
it goes up again to 39 percent,

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:34.000
indicating a rising living cost.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.000
The Gini coefficient

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:39.000
has already passed the dangerous line of 0.4.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.000
Now it's 0.5 --

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:44.000
even worse than that in America --

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:47.000
showing us the income inequality.

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.000
And so you see this whole society

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.000
getting frustrated

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:54.000
about losing some of its mobility.

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:57.000
And also, the bitterness and even resentment

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.000
towards the rich and the powerful

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.000
is quite widespread.

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.000
So any accusations of corruption

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:07.000
or backdoor dealings between authorities or business

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:09.000
would arouse a social outcry

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:11.000
or even unrest.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:15.000
So through some of the hottest topics on microblogging,

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:18.000
we can see what young people care most about.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.000
Social justice and government accountability

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:23.000
runs the first in what they demand.

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:25.000
For the past decade or so,

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:29.000
a massive urbanization and development

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:32.000
have let us witness a lot of reports

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.000
on the forced demolition

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.000
of private property.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:39.000
And it has aroused huge anger and frustration

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:41.000
among our young generation.

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.000
Sometimes people get killed,

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:47.000
and sometimes people set themselves on fire to protest.

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:49.000
So when these incidents are reported

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:51.000
more and more frequently on the Internet,

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:54.000
people cry for the government to take actions to stop this.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:57.000
So the good news is that earlier this year,

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:00.000
the state council passed a new regulation

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:03.000
on house requisition and demolition

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:05.000
and passed the right

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:07.000
to order forced demolition from local governments

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:09.000
to the court.

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:13.000
Similarly, many other issues concerning public safety

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:16.000
is a hot topic on the Internet.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.000
We heard about polluted air,

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:21.000
polluted water, poisoned food.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:24.000
And guess what, we have faked beef.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.000
They have sorts of ingredients

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:29.000
that you brush on a piece of chicken or fish,

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:32.000
and it turns it to look like beef.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.000
And then lately,

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:36.000
people are very concerned about cooking oil,

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:39.000
because thousands of people have been found

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:41.000
[refining] cooking oil

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:43.000
from restaurant slop.

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:45.000
So all these things

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:49.000
have aroused a huge outcry from the Internet.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:51.000
And fortunately,

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:53.000
we have seen the government

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:56.000
responding more timely and also more frequently

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:58.000
to the public concerns.

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:00.000
While young people seem to be very sure

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.000
about their participation

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.000
in public policy-making,

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:06.000
but sometimes they're a little bit lost

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:09.000
in terms of what they want for their personal life.

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:11.000
China is soon to pass the U.S.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:13.000
as the number one market

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:15.000
for luxury brands --

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:17.000
that's not including the Chinese expenditures

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:19.000
in Europe and elsewhere.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:22.000
But you know what, half of those consumers

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:25.000
are earning a salary below 2,000 U.S. dollars.

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:27.000
They're not rich at all.

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:30.000
They're taking those bags and clothes

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:33.000
as a sense of identity and social status.

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:35.000
And this is a girl explicitly saying

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:37.000
on a TV dating show

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.000
that she would rather cry in a BMW

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:42.000
than smile on a bicycle.

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:44.000
But of course, we do have young people

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.000
who would still prefer to smile,

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.000
whether in a BMW or [on] a bicycle.

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:52.000
So in the next picture, you see a very popular phenomenon

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:55.000
called "naked" wedding, or "naked" marriage.

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:58.000
It does not mean they will wear nothing in the wedding,

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:01.000
but it shows that these young couples are ready to get married

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:04.000
without a house, without a car, without a diamond ring

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:06.000
and without a wedding banquet,

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:09.000
to show their commitment to true love.

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:12.000
And also, people are doing good through social media.

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:14.000
And the first picture showed us

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:18.000
that a truck caging 500 homeless and kidnapped dogs

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.000
for food processing

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:23.000
was spotted and stopped on the highway

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:25.000
with the whole country watching

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:27.000
through microblogging.

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:29.000
People were donating money, dog food

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:32.000
and offering volunteer work to stop that truck.

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:34.000
And after hours of negotiation,

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:37.000
500 dogs were rescued.

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:41.000
And here also people are helping to find missing children.

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:44.000
A father posted his son's picture onto the Internet.

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:47.000
After thousands of resends in relay,

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:49.000
the child was found,

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:52.000
and we witnessed the reunion of the family

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:54.000
through microblogging.

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:57.000
So happiness is the most popular word

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:00.000
we have heard through the past two years.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:03.000
Happiness is not only related

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:05.000
to personal experiences and personal values,

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:07.000
but also, it's about the environment.

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:10.000
People are thinking about the following questions:

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:13.000
Are we going to sacrifice our environment further

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:16.000
to produce higher GDP?

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:19.000
How are we going to perform our social and political reform

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:22.000
to keep pace with economic growth,

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:25.000
to keep sustainability and stability?

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:28.000
And also, how capable is the system

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:30.000
of self-correctness

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:33.000
to keep more people content

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:36.000
with all sorts of friction going on at the same time?

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:39.000
I guess these are the questions people are going to answer.

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:41.000
And our younger generation

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:43.000
are going to transform this country

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:47.000
while at the same time being transformed themselves.

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:49.000
Thank you very much.

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:52.000
(Applause)
