WEBVTT

00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:02.381
So, I have a strange career.

00:00:02.405 --> 00:00:05.521
I know it because people come up to me,
like colleagues, and say,

00:00:05.545 --> 00:00:07.411
"Chris, you have a strange career."

00:00:07.435 --> 00:00:09.078
(Laughter)

00:00:09.102 --> 00:00:10.421
And I can see their point,

00:00:10.445 --> 00:00:14.976
because I started my career
as a theoretical nuclear physicist.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.164
And I was thinking about quarks
and gluons and heavy ion collisions,

00:00:19.188 --> 00:00:20.976
and I was only 14 years old --

00:00:21.593 --> 00:00:24.280
No, no, I wasn't 14 years old.

00:00:25.237 --> 00:00:26.976
But after that,

00:00:27.796 --> 00:00:29.737
I actually had my own lab

00:00:29.761 --> 00:00:31.876
in the Computational
Neuroscience department,

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:33.628
and I wasn't doing any neuroscience.

00:00:33.652 --> 00:00:36.584
Later, I would work
on evolutionary genetics,

00:00:36.608 --> 00:00:38.558
and I would work on systems biology.

00:00:38.582 --> 00:00:41.247
But I'm going to tell you
about something else today.

00:00:41.271 --> 00:00:45.533
I'm going to tell you
about how I learned something about life.

00:00:45.557 --> 00:00:49.038
And I was actually a rocket scientist.

00:00:49.062 --> 00:00:51.365
I wasn't really a rocket scientist,

00:00:51.389 --> 00:00:55.745
but I was working
at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory

00:00:55.769 --> 00:00:58.404
in sunny California, where it's warm;

00:00:58.428 --> 00:01:02.276
whereas now I am
in the mid-West, and it's cold.

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:04.976
But it was an exciting experience.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.443
One day, a NASA manager
comes into my office,

00:01:08.467 --> 00:01:10.976
sits down and says,

00:01:11.602 --> 00:01:15.403
"Can you please tell us,
how do we look for life outside Earth?"

00:01:16.361 --> 00:01:18.039
And that came as a surprise to me,

00:01:18.063 --> 00:01:21.697
because I was actually hired
to work on quantum computation.

00:01:22.213 --> 00:01:23.714
Yet, I had a very good answer.

00:01:23.738 --> 00:01:25.164
I said, "I have no idea."

00:01:25.539 --> 00:01:26.689
(Laughter)

00:01:26.713 --> 00:01:32.055
And he told me, "Biosignatures,
we need to look for a biosignature."

00:01:32.079 --> 00:01:33.443
And I said, "What is that?"

00:01:33.467 --> 00:01:36.064
And he said, "It's any
measurable phenomenon

00:01:36.088 --> 00:01:38.933
that allows us to indicate
the presence of life."

00:01:39.528 --> 00:01:40.678
And I said, "Really?

00:01:41.173 --> 00:01:43.120
Because isn't that easy?

00:01:43.144 --> 00:01:44.975
I mean, we have life.

00:01:44.999 --> 00:01:46.971
Can't you apply a definition,

00:01:46.995 --> 00:01:51.169
for example, a Supreme Court-like
definition of life?"

00:01:51.931 --> 00:01:54.473
And then I thought about it
a little bit, and I said,

00:01:54.497 --> 00:01:55.972
"Well, is it really that easy?

00:01:55.996 --> 00:01:58.189
Because, yes, if you see
something like this,

00:01:58.213 --> 00:02:00.557
then all right, fine,
I'm going to call it life --

00:02:00.581 --> 00:02:01.731
no doubt about it.

00:02:02.257 --> 00:02:03.897
But here's something."

00:02:03.921 --> 00:02:06.976
And he goes, "Right,
that's life too. I know that."

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.592
Except, if you think that life
is also defined by things that die,

00:02:11.616 --> 00:02:13.369
you're not in luck with this thing,

00:02:13.393 --> 00:02:15.655
because that's actually
a very strange organism.

00:02:15.679 --> 00:02:17.726
It grows up into the adult stage like that

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:19.976
and then goes through
a Benjamin Button phase,

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.935
and actually goes backwards and backwards
until it's like a little embryo again,

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:27.873
and then actually grows back up,
and back down and back up --

00:02:27.897 --> 00:02:29.676
sort of yo-yo -- and it never dies.

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:31.926
So it's actually life,

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:35.975
but it's actually not
as we thought life would be.

00:02:36.491 --> 00:02:38.402
And then you see something like that.

00:02:38.426 --> 00:02:41.299
And he was like, "My God,
what kind of a life form is that?"

00:02:41.323 --> 00:02:42.742
Anyone know?

00:02:42.766 --> 00:02:45.768
It's actually not life, it's a crystal.

00:02:46.282 --> 00:02:49.583
So once you start looking and looking
at smaller and smaller things --

00:02:49.607 --> 00:02:52.769
so this particular person wrote
a whole article and said,

00:02:52.793 --> 00:02:54.274
"Hey, these are bacteria."

00:02:54.298 --> 00:02:56.269
Except, if you look a little bit closer,

00:02:56.293 --> 00:02:59.929
you see, in fact, that this thing
is way too small to be anything like that.

00:02:59.953 --> 00:03:03.111
So he was convinced,
but, in fact, most people aren't.

00:03:03.792 --> 00:03:06.976
And then, of course,
NASA also had a big announcement,

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.865
and President Clinton
gave a press conference,

00:03:09.889 --> 00:03:14.750
about this amazing discovery
of life in a Martian meteorite.

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:18.361
Except that nowadays,
it's heavily disputed.

00:03:18.806 --> 00:03:21.241
If you take the lesson
of all these pictures,

00:03:21.265 --> 00:03:24.159
then you realize, well, actually,
maybe it's not that easy.

00:03:24.183 --> 00:03:27.582
Maybe I do need a definition of life

00:03:27.606 --> 00:03:29.884
in order to make that kind of distinction.

00:03:29.908 --> 00:03:32.439
So can life be defined?

00:03:32.463 --> 00:03:33.970
Well how would you go about it?

00:03:33.994 --> 00:03:38.001
Well of course, you'd go
to Encyclopedia Britannica and open at L.

00:03:38.025 --> 00:03:41.037
No, of course you don't do that;
you put it somewhere in Google.

00:03:41.061 --> 00:03:42.652
And then you might get something.

00:03:42.676 --> 00:03:43.700
(Laughter)

00:03:43.724 --> 00:03:44.942
And what you might get --

00:03:44.966 --> 00:03:48.745
and anything that actually refers
to things that we are used to,

00:03:48.769 --> 00:03:49.991
you throw away.

00:03:50.015 --> 00:03:52.513
And then you might come up
with something like this.

00:03:52.537 --> 00:03:55.794
And it says something complicated
with lots and lots of concepts.

00:03:55.818 --> 00:04:01.178
Who on Earth would write something
as convoluted and complex and inane?

00:04:02.952 --> 00:04:06.853
Oh, it's actually a really, really,
important set of concepts.

00:04:06.877 --> 00:04:08.976
So I'm highlighting just a few words

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.924
and saying definitions
like that rely on things

00:04:12.948 --> 00:04:19.097
that are not based on amino acids
or leaves or anything that we are used to,

00:04:19.121 --> 00:04:20.872
but in fact on processes only.

00:04:20.896 --> 00:04:22.767
And if you take a look at that,

00:04:22.791 --> 00:04:26.248
this was actually in a book that I wrote
that deals with artificial life.

00:04:26.272 --> 00:04:30.499
And that explains why that NASA manager
was actually in my office to begin with.

00:04:30.523 --> 00:04:33.610
Because the idea was that,
with concepts like that,

00:04:33.634 --> 00:04:37.654
maybe we can actually
manufacture a form of life.

00:04:37.678 --> 00:04:42.475
And so if you go and ask yourself,
"What on Earth is artificial life?",

00:04:42.499 --> 00:04:46.168
let me give you a whirlwind tour
of how all this stuff came about.

00:04:46.192 --> 00:04:49.327
And it started out quite a while ago,

00:04:49.351 --> 00:04:53.676
when someone wrote one of the first
successful computer viruses.

00:04:53.985 --> 00:04:56.158
And for those of you
who aren't old enough,

00:04:56.182 --> 00:04:58.765
you have no idea
how this infection was working --

00:04:58.789 --> 00:05:01.049
namely, through these floppy disks.

00:05:01.073 --> 00:05:04.960
But the interesting thing
about these computer virus infections

00:05:04.984 --> 00:05:08.436
was that, if you look at the rate
at which the infection worked,

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:12.610
they show this spiky behavior
that you're used to from a flu virus.

00:05:12.634 --> 00:05:14.976
And it is in fact due to this arms race

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.456
between hackers
and operating system designers

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:20.080
that things go back and forth.

00:05:20.104 --> 00:05:24.615
And the result is kind of
a tree of life of these viruses,

00:05:24.639 --> 00:05:28.244
a phylogeny that looks very much
like the type of life

00:05:28.268 --> 00:05:30.697
that we're used to,
at least on the viral level.

00:05:30.721 --> 00:05:32.051
So is that life?

00:05:32.266 --> 00:05:33.882
Not as far as I'm concerned.

00:05:33.906 --> 00:05:36.748
Why? Because these things
don't evolve by themselves.

00:05:36.772 --> 00:05:38.725
In fact, they have hackers writing them.

00:05:38.749 --> 00:05:42.079
But the idea was taken
very quickly a little bit further,

00:05:42.103 --> 00:05:45.414
when a scientist working
at the Santa Fe Institute decided,

00:05:45.438 --> 00:05:48.571
"Why don't we try to package
these little viruses

00:05:48.595 --> 00:05:50.810
in artificial worlds
inside of the computer

00:05:50.834 --> 00:05:52.105
and let them evolve?"

00:05:52.129 --> 00:05:53.723
And this was Steen Rasmussen.

00:05:53.747 --> 00:05:56.439
And he designed this system,
but it really didn't work,

00:05:56.463 --> 00:05:59.347
because his viruses
were constantly destroying each other.

00:05:59.371 --> 00:06:02.888
But there was another scientist
who had been watching this, an ecologist.

00:06:02.912 --> 00:06:05.404
And he went home and says,
"I know how to fix this."

00:06:05.428 --> 00:06:07.072
And he wrote the Tierra system,

00:06:07.096 --> 00:06:08.301
and, in my book,

00:06:08.325 --> 00:06:12.149
is in fact one of the first
truly artificial living systems --

00:06:12.173 --> 00:06:15.635
except for the fact that these programs
didn't really grow in complexity.

00:06:15.659 --> 00:06:18.523
So having seen this work,
worked a little bit on this,

00:06:18.547 --> 00:06:20.205
this is where I came in.

00:06:20.229 --> 00:06:23.872
And I decided to create a system
that has all the properties

00:06:23.896 --> 00:06:27.742
that are necessary to see, in fact,
the evolution of complexity,

00:06:27.766 --> 00:06:31.068
more and more complex
problems constantly evolving.

00:06:31.092 --> 00:06:34.876
And of course, since I really don't know
how to write code, I had help in this.

00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:36.448
I had two undergraduate students

00:06:36.472 --> 00:06:39.201
at California Institute of Technology
that worked with me.

00:06:39.225 --> 00:06:42.077
That's Charles Ofria on the left,
Titus Brown on the right.

00:06:42.101 --> 00:06:44.436
They are now, actually,
respectable professors

00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:46.202
at Michigan State University,

00:06:46.226 --> 00:06:50.727
but I can assure you, back in the day,
we were not a respectable team.

00:06:50.751 --> 00:06:52.800
And I'm really happy
that no photo survives

00:06:52.824 --> 00:06:55.347
of the three of us
anywhere close together.

00:06:56.092 --> 00:06:57.967
But what is this system like?

00:06:57.991 --> 00:07:00.180
Well I can't really go into the details,

00:07:00.204 --> 00:07:02.857
but what you see here
is some of the entrails.

00:07:02.881 --> 00:07:06.966
But what I wanted to focus on
is this type of population structure.

00:07:06.990 --> 00:07:09.462
There's about 10,000
programs sitting here.

00:07:09.486 --> 00:07:12.405
And all different strains
are colored in different colors.

00:07:12.429 --> 00:07:16.033
And as you see here, there are groups
that are growing on top of each other,

00:07:16.057 --> 00:07:17.398
because they are spreading.

00:07:17.422 --> 00:07:21.526
Any time there is a program
that's better at surviving in this world,

00:07:21.550 --> 00:07:23.518
due to whatever mutation it has acquired,

00:07:23.542 --> 00:07:27.012
it is going to spread over the others
and drive the others to extinction.

00:07:27.036 --> 00:07:28.591
So I'm going to show you a movie

00:07:28.615 --> 00:07:30.842
where you're going to see
that kind of dynamic.

00:07:30.866 --> 00:07:35.142
And these kinds of experiments are started
with programs that we wrote ourselves.

00:07:35.166 --> 00:07:38.503
We write our own stuff, replicate it,
and are very proud of ourselves.

00:07:38.527 --> 00:07:41.303
And we put them in,
and what you see immediately

00:07:41.327 --> 00:07:44.393
is that there are waves
and waves of innovation.

00:07:44.417 --> 00:07:46.311
By the way, this is highly accelerated,

00:07:46.335 --> 00:07:48.532
so it's like a 1000 generations a second.

00:07:48.556 --> 00:07:52.523
But immediately, the system goes like,
"What kind of dumb piece of code was this?

00:07:52.547 --> 00:07:56.268
This can be improved upon
in so many ways, so quickly."

00:07:56.292 --> 00:08:00.040
So you see waves of new types
taking over the other types.

00:08:00.064 --> 00:08:02.626
And this type of activity
goes on for quite a while,

00:08:02.650 --> 00:08:07.471
until the main easy things
have been acquired by these programs.

00:08:07.495 --> 00:08:10.976
And then, you see
sort of like a stasis coming on

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:12.976
where the system essentially waits

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:16.183
for a new type of innovation,
like this one,

00:08:16.207 --> 00:08:20.489
which is going to spread over
all the other innovations that were before

00:08:20.513 --> 00:08:22.976
and is erasing the genes
that it had before,

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:26.976
until a new type of higher level
of complexity has been achieved.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.976
And this process goes on and on and on.

00:08:30.467 --> 00:08:31.782
So what we see here

00:08:31.806 --> 00:08:35.969
is a system that lives in very much
the way we're used to how life goes.

00:08:36.688 --> 00:08:40.808
But what the NASA people
had asked me really was,

00:08:41.213 --> 00:08:43.975
"Do these guys have a biosignature?

00:08:44.580 --> 00:08:46.393
Can we measure this type of life?

00:08:46.417 --> 00:08:47.609
Because if we can,

00:08:47.633 --> 00:08:51.482
maybe we have a chance of actually
discovering life somewhere else

00:08:51.506 --> 00:08:54.660
without being biased
by things like amino acids."

00:08:55.221 --> 00:08:59.754
So I said, "Well, perhaps
we should construct a biosignature

00:08:59.778 --> 00:09:02.976
based on life as a universal process.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:07.864
In fact, it should perhaps make use
of the concepts that I developed

00:09:07.888 --> 00:09:11.975
just in order to sort of capture
what a simple living system might be."

00:09:11.999 --> 00:09:13.518
And the thing I came up with --

00:09:13.542 --> 00:09:17.524
I have to first give you
an introduction about the idea,

00:09:17.548 --> 00:09:21.087
and maybe that would be
a meaning detector,

00:09:21.111 --> 00:09:22.658
rather than a life detector.

00:09:23.226 --> 00:09:24.976
And the way we would do that --

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.636
I would like to find out
how I can distinguish text

00:09:27.660 --> 00:09:32.307
that was written by a million monkeys,
as opposed to text that is in our books.

00:09:32.645 --> 00:09:34.522
And I would like to do it in such a way

00:09:34.546 --> 00:09:37.424
that I don't actually have to be able
to read the language,

00:09:37.448 --> 00:09:39.218
because I'm sure I won't be able to.

00:09:39.242 --> 00:09:41.742
As long as I know
that there's some sort of alphabet.

00:09:41.766 --> 00:09:44.096
So here would be a frequency plot

00:09:44.120 --> 00:09:47.502
of how often you find
each of the 26 letters of the alphabet

00:09:47.526 --> 00:09:49.745
in a text written by random monkeys.

00:09:50.195 --> 00:09:54.749
And obviously, each of these letters
comes off about roughly equally frequent.

00:09:54.773 --> 00:09:58.365
But if you now look at the same
distribution in English texts,

00:09:58.389 --> 00:09:59.637
it looks like that.

00:10:00.202 --> 00:10:03.750
And I'm telling you,
this is very robust across English texts.

00:10:03.774 --> 00:10:06.758
And if I look at French texts,
it looks a little bit different,

00:10:06.782 --> 00:10:07.960
or Italian or German.

00:10:07.984 --> 00:10:11.400
They all have their own type
of frequency distribution,

00:10:11.424 --> 00:10:12.857
but it's robust.

00:10:12.881 --> 00:10:16.088
It doesn't matter whether it writes
about politics or about science.

00:10:16.112 --> 00:10:21.892
It doesn't matter whether it's a poem
or whether it's a mathematical text.

00:10:21.916 --> 00:10:23.753
It's a robust signature,

00:10:23.777 --> 00:10:25.597
and it's very stable.

00:10:25.621 --> 00:10:27.778
As long as our books
are written in English --

00:10:27.802 --> 00:10:30.593
because people are rewriting them
and recopying them --

00:10:30.617 --> 00:10:31.976
it's going to be there.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:37.761
So that inspired me to think about,
well, what if I try to use this idea

00:10:37.785 --> 00:10:41.540
in order, not to detect random texts
from texts with meaning,

00:10:41.564 --> 00:10:45.293
but rather detect the fact
that there is meaning

00:10:45.317 --> 00:10:47.844
in the biomolecules that make up life.

00:10:47.868 --> 00:10:49.036
But first I have to ask:

00:10:49.060 --> 00:10:50.548
what are these building blocks,

00:10:50.572 --> 00:10:52.868
like the alphabet, elements
that I showed you?

00:10:52.892 --> 00:10:55.765
Well it turns out, we have
many different alternatives

00:10:55.789 --> 00:10:58.103
for such a set of building blocks.

00:10:58.127 --> 00:10:59.375
We could use amino acids,

00:10:59.399 --> 00:11:02.601
we could use nucleic acids,
carboxylic acids, fatty acids.

00:11:02.625 --> 00:11:06.063
In fact, chemistry's extremely rich,
and our body uses a lot of them.

00:11:06.087 --> 00:11:08.393
So that we actually, to test this idea,

00:11:08.417 --> 00:11:11.964
first took a look at amino acids
and some other carboxylic acids.

00:11:11.988 --> 00:11:13.459
And here's the result.

00:11:13.483 --> 00:11:16.649
Here is, in fact, what you get

00:11:16.673 --> 00:11:19.696
if you, for example, look
at the distribution of amino acids

00:11:19.720 --> 00:11:24.455
on a comet or in interstellar space
or, in fact, in a laboratory,

00:11:24.479 --> 00:11:27.138
where you made very sure
that in your primordial soup,

00:11:27.162 --> 00:11:29.080
there is no living stuff in there.

00:11:29.104 --> 00:11:31.983
What you find is mostly
glycine and then alanine

00:11:32.007 --> 00:11:34.366
and there's some trace elements
of the other ones.

00:11:34.390 --> 00:11:36.819
That is also very robust --

00:11:36.843 --> 00:11:40.675
what you find in systems like Earth

00:11:40.699 --> 00:11:43.844
where there are amino acids,
but there is no life.

00:11:43.868 --> 00:11:48.498
But suppose you take some dirt
and dig through it

00:11:48.522 --> 00:11:51.482
and then put it into these spectrometers,

00:11:51.506 --> 00:11:53.604
because there's bacteria
all over the place;

00:11:53.628 --> 00:11:55.859
or you take water anywhere on Earth,

00:11:55.883 --> 00:11:57.400
because it's teaming with life,

00:11:57.424 --> 00:11:59.174
and you make the same analysis;

00:11:59.198 --> 00:12:01.775
the spectrum looks completely different.

00:12:01.799 --> 00:12:05.174
Of course, there is still
glycine and alanine,

00:12:05.198 --> 00:12:08.518
but in fact, there are these heavy
elements, these heavy amino acids,

00:12:08.542 --> 00:12:11.937
that are being produced
because they are valuable to the organism.

00:12:13.067 --> 00:12:17.005
And some other ones
that are not used in the set of 20,

00:12:17.029 --> 00:12:19.927
they will not appear at all
in any type of concentration.

00:12:19.951 --> 00:12:22.656
So this also turns out
to be extremely robust.

00:12:22.680 --> 00:12:25.798
It doesn't matter what kind of sediment
you're using to grind up,

00:12:25.822 --> 00:12:29.101
whether it's bacteria
or any other plants or animals.

00:12:29.125 --> 00:12:30.549
Anywhere there's life,

00:12:30.573 --> 00:12:32.524
you're going to have this distribution,

00:12:32.548 --> 00:12:34.365
as opposed to that distribution.

00:12:34.389 --> 00:12:37.626
And it is detectable
not just in amino acids.

00:12:37.650 --> 00:12:38.867
Now you could ask:

00:12:38.891 --> 00:12:42.050
Well, what about these Avidians?

00:12:42.074 --> 00:12:45.125
The Avidians being the denizens
of this computer world

00:12:45.149 --> 00:12:48.594
where they are perfectly happy
replicating and growing in complexity.

00:12:48.618 --> 00:12:53.635
So this is the distribution that you get
if, in fact, there is no life.

00:12:53.659 --> 00:12:56.377
They have about 28 of these instructions.

00:12:56.401 --> 00:12:59.753
And if you have a system where
they're being replaced one by the other,

00:12:59.777 --> 00:13:01.962
it's like the monkeys
writing on a typewriter.

00:13:01.986 --> 00:13:06.206
Each of these instructions
appears with roughly the equal frequency.

00:13:07.115 --> 00:13:11.895
But if you now take
a set of replicating guys

00:13:11.919 --> 00:13:13.869
like in the video that you saw,

00:13:13.893 --> 00:13:15.412
it looks like this.

00:13:16.199 --> 00:13:17.672
So there are some instructions

00:13:17.696 --> 00:13:20.129
that are extremely valuable
to these organisms,

00:13:20.153 --> 00:13:22.123
and their frequency is going to be high.

00:13:22.147 --> 00:13:26.188
And there's actually some instructions
that you only use once, if ever.

00:13:26.212 --> 00:13:27.735
So they are either poisonous

00:13:27.759 --> 00:13:32.264
or really should be used
at less of a level than random.

00:13:32.288 --> 00:13:34.976
In this case, the frequency is lower.

00:13:35.932 --> 00:13:38.603
And so now we can see,
is that really a robust signature?

00:13:38.627 --> 00:13:39.984
I can tell you indeed it is,

00:13:40.008 --> 00:13:43.256
because this type of spectrum,
just like what you've seen in books,

00:13:43.280 --> 00:13:45.433
and just like what you've seen
in amino acids,

00:13:45.457 --> 00:13:48.099
it doesn't really matter
how you change the environment,

00:13:48.123 --> 00:13:50.747
it's very robust, it's going
to reflect the environment.

00:13:50.771 --> 00:13:53.720
So I'm going to show you now
a little experiment that we did.

00:13:53.744 --> 00:13:55.128
And I have to explain to you,

00:13:55.152 --> 00:13:56.334
the top of this graph

00:13:56.358 --> 00:13:59.102
shows you that frequency
distribution that I talked about.

00:13:59.126 --> 00:14:02.933
Here, that's the lifeless environment

00:14:02.957 --> 00:14:06.369
where each instruction occurs
at an equal frequency.

00:14:07.304 --> 00:14:12.297
And below there, I show, in fact,
the mutation rate in the environment.

00:14:12.321 --> 00:14:15.624
And I'm starting this
at a mutation rate that is so high

00:14:15.648 --> 00:14:19.614
that even if you would drop
a replicating program

00:14:19.638 --> 00:14:23.763
that would otherwise happily grow up
to fill the entire world,

00:14:23.787 --> 00:14:26.797
if you drop it in, it gets mutated
to death immediately.

00:14:26.821 --> 00:14:32.167
So there is no life possible
at that type of mutation rate.

00:14:32.191 --> 00:14:36.227
But then I'm going to slowly
turn down the heat, so to speak,

00:14:36.251 --> 00:14:38.436
and then there's this viability threshold

00:14:38.460 --> 00:14:42.352
where now it would be possible
for a replicator to actually live.

00:14:42.376 --> 00:14:47.721
And indeed, we're going to be dropping
these guys into that soup all the time.

00:14:48.159 --> 00:14:49.795
So let's see what that looks like.

00:14:49.819 --> 00:14:52.817
So first, nothing, nothing, nothing.

00:14:52.841 --> 00:14:54.656
Too hot, too hot.

00:14:54.680 --> 00:14:56.976
Now the viability threshold is reached,

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:01.492
and the frequency distribution
has dramatically changed

00:15:01.516 --> 00:15:02.992
and, in fact, stabilizes.

00:15:03.016 --> 00:15:04.526
And now what I did there

00:15:04.550 --> 00:15:08.148
is, I was being nasty,
I just turned up the heat again and again.

00:15:08.172 --> 00:15:10.518
And of course, it reaches
the viability threshold.

00:15:10.542 --> 00:15:13.410
And I'm just showing this to you
again because it's so nice.

00:15:13.434 --> 00:15:14.976
You hit the viability threshold.

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:16.976
The distribution changes to "alive!"

00:15:17.431 --> 00:15:20.648
And then, once you hit the threshold

00:15:20.672 --> 00:15:24.721
where the mutation rate is so high
that you cannot self-reproduce,

00:15:24.745 --> 00:15:29.666
you cannot copy the information
forward to your offspring

00:15:29.690 --> 00:15:34.420
without making so many mistakes
that your ability to replicate vanishes.

00:15:34.444 --> 00:15:36.303
And then, that signature is lost.

00:15:37.956 --> 00:15:39.662
What do we learn from that?

00:15:39.686 --> 00:15:43.482
Well, I think we learn
a number of things from that.

00:15:43.506 --> 00:15:44.976
One of them is,

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:50.224
if we are able to think about life
in abstract terms --

00:15:50.248 --> 00:15:52.879
and we're not talking
about things like plants,

00:15:52.903 --> 00:15:54.828
and we're not talking about amino acids,

00:15:54.852 --> 00:15:56.616
and we're not talking about bacteria,

00:15:56.640 --> 00:15:58.750
but we think in terms of processes --

00:15:58.774 --> 00:16:00.976
then we could start to think about life

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:03.619
not as something
that is so special to Earth,

00:16:03.643 --> 00:16:06.153
but that, in fact, could exist anywhere.

00:16:06.177 --> 00:16:10.490
Because it really only has to do
with these concepts of information,

00:16:10.514 --> 00:16:14.572
of storing information
within physical substrates --

00:16:14.596 --> 00:16:18.612
anything: bits, nucleic acids,
anything that's an alphabet --

00:16:18.636 --> 00:16:20.515
and make sure that there's some process

00:16:20.539 --> 00:16:24.254
so that this information can be stored
for much longer than you would expect --

00:16:24.816 --> 00:16:29.152
the time scales for
the deterioration of information.

00:16:29.176 --> 00:16:32.344
And if you can do that,
then you have life.

00:16:32.368 --> 00:16:34.622
So the first thing that we learn

00:16:34.646 --> 00:16:39.858
is that it is possible to define life
in terms of processes alone,

00:16:39.882 --> 00:16:44.859
without referring at all
to the type of things that we hold dear,

00:16:44.883 --> 00:16:47.554
as far as the type of life on Earth is.

00:16:47.578 --> 00:16:50.219
And that, in a sense, removes us again,

00:16:50.243 --> 00:16:53.074
like all of our scientific discoveries,
or many of them --

00:16:53.098 --> 00:16:55.869
it's this continuous dethroning of man --

00:16:55.893 --> 00:16:58.620
of how we think we're special
because we're alive.

00:16:58.644 --> 00:17:01.700
Well, we can make life;
we can make life in the computer.

00:17:01.724 --> 00:17:03.541
Granted, it's limited,

00:17:03.565 --> 00:17:08.682
but we have learned what it takes
in order to actually construct it.

00:17:08.706 --> 00:17:11.494
And once we have that,

00:17:11.518 --> 00:17:14.165
then it is not such
a difficult task anymore

00:17:14.189 --> 00:17:18.341
to say, if we understand
the fundamental processes

00:17:18.365 --> 00:17:21.707
that do not refer
to any particular substrate,

00:17:21.731 --> 00:17:25.499
then we can go out and try other worlds,

00:17:25.523 --> 00:17:29.304
figure out what kind of chemical
alphabets might there be,

00:17:30.033 --> 00:17:34.758
figure enough about the normal chemistry,
the geochemistry of the planet,

00:17:34.782 --> 00:17:38.556
so that we know what this distribution
would look like in the absence of life,

00:17:38.580 --> 00:17:41.551
and then look for large
deviations from this --

00:17:41.575 --> 00:17:46.687
this thing sticking out, which says,
"This chemical really shouldn't be there."

00:17:46.711 --> 00:17:48.666
Now we don't know that there's life then,

00:17:48.690 --> 00:17:49.897
but we could say,

00:17:49.921 --> 00:17:53.690
"Well at least I'm going to have to take
a look very precisely at this chemical

00:17:53.714 --> 00:17:55.759
and see where it comes from."

00:17:55.783 --> 00:17:59.494
And that might be our chance
of actually discovering life

00:17:59.518 --> 00:18:01.637
when we cannot visibly see it.

00:18:01.661 --> 00:18:06.225
And so that's really the only
take-home message that I have for you.

00:18:06.249 --> 00:18:10.480
Life can be less mysterious
than we make it out to be

00:18:10.504 --> 00:18:13.709
when we try to think
about how it would be on other planets.

00:18:14.280 --> 00:18:17.667
And if we remove the mystery of life,

00:18:17.691 --> 00:18:22.376
then I think it is a little bit easier
for us to think about how we live,

00:18:22.400 --> 00:18:25.458
and how perhaps we're not as special
as we always think we are.

00:18:25.482 --> 00:18:27.728
And I'm going to leave you with that.

00:18:27.752 --> 00:18:28.976
And thank you very much.

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:31.174
(Applause)
