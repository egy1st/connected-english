00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
I'm a garbage man.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
And you might find it interesting that I became a garbage man,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
because I absolutely hate waste.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
I hope, within the next 10 minutes,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
to change the way you think

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
about a lot of the stuff in your life.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
And I'd like to start at the very beginning.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Think back when you were just a kid.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
How did look at the stuff in your life?

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Perhaps it was like these toddler rules:

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
It's my stuff if I saw it first.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
The entire pile is my stuff if I'm building something.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
The more stuff that's mine, the better.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
And of course, it's your stuff if it's broken.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
(Laughter)

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Well after spending about 20 years in the recycling industry,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
it's become pretty clear to me

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
that we don't necessarily leave these toddler rules behind

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
as we develop into adults.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
And let me tell you why I have that perspective.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
Because each and every day

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
at our recycling plants around the world

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
we handle about one million pounds

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
of people's discarded stuff.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
Now a million pounds a day sounds like a lot of stuff,

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
but it's a tiny drop of the durable goods

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
that are disposed each and every year around the world --

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
well less than one percent.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
In fact, the United Nations estimates

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
that there's about 85 billion pounds a year

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
of electronics waste

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
that gets discarded around the world each and every year --

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
and that's one of the most rapidly growing parts of our waste stream.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
And if you throw in other durable goods like automobiles and so forth,

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
that number well more than doubles.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
And of course, the more developed the country,

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
the bigger these mountains.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
Now when you see these mountains,

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
most people think of garbage.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
We see above-ground mines.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
And the reason we see mines is because there's a lot of valuable raw materials

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
that went into making all of this stuff in the first place.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
And it's becoming increasingly important

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
that we figure out how to extract these raw materials

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
from these extremely complicated waste streams.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
Because as we've heard all week at TED,

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
the world's getting to be a smaller place with more people in it

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
who want more and more stuff.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
And of course, they want the toys and the tools

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
that many of us take for granted.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
And what goes into making those toys and tools

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
that we use every single day?

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000
It's mostly many types of plastics and many types of metals.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000
And the metals, we typically get

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
from ore that we mine

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
in ever widening mines

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
and ever deepening mines around the world.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000
And the plastics, we get from oil,

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
which we go to more remote locations

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000
and drill ever deeper wells to extract.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
And these practices have

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
significant economic and environmental implications

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
that we're already starting to see today.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
The good news is we are starting to recover materials from our end-of-life stuff

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
and starting to recycle our end-of-life stuff,

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000
particularly in regions of the world like here in Europe

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000
that have recycling policies in place

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
that require that this stuff be recycled

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
in a responsible manner.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
Most of what's extracted from our end-of-life stuff,

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000
if it makes it to a recycler, are the metals.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
To put that in perspective --

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
and I'm using steel as a proxy here for metals,

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
because it's the most common metal --

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
if your stuff makes it to a recycler,

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000
probably over 90 percent of the metals

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000
are going to be recovered and reused for another purpose.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
Plastics are a whole other story:

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
well less than 10 percent are recovered.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000
In fact, it's more like five percent.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
Most of it's incinerated or landfilled.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
Now most people think that's because plastics are a throw-away material,

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000
have very little value.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000
But actually, plastics are several times more valuable than steel.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000
And there's more plastics produced and consumed

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000
around the world on a volume basis

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
every year than steel.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
So why is such a plentiful and valuable material

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
not recovered at anywhere near the rate

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000
of the less valuable material?

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000
Well it's predominantly because

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000
metals are very easy to recycle

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000
from other materials and from one another.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000
They have very different densities.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000
They have different electrical and magnetic properties.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000
And they even have different colors.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.000
So it's very easy for either humans or machines

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000
to separate these metals

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000
from one another and from other materials.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:57.000
Plastics have overlapping densities over a very narrow range.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
They have either identical or very similar

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
electrical and magnetic properties.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000
And any plastic can be any color,

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000
as you probably well know.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000
So the traditional ways of separating materials

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.000
just simply don't work for plastics.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.000
Another consequence of metals being so easy to recycle by humans

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.000
is that a lot of our stuff from the developed world --

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.000
and sadly to say, particularly from the United States,

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.000
where we don't have any recycling policies in place like here in Europe --

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.000
finds its way to developing countries

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.000
for low-cost recycling.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000
People, for as little as a dollar a day, pick through our stuff.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000
They extract what they can, which is mostly the metals --

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000
circuit boards and so forth --

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000
and they leave behind mostly what they can't recover,

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.000
which is, again, mostly the plastics.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.000
Or they burn the plastics to get to the metals

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000
in burn houses like you see here.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000
And they extract the metals by hand.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.000
Now while this may be the low-economic-cost solution,

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000
this is certainly not the low-environmental

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000
or human health-and-safety solution.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000
I call this environmental arbitrage.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000
And it's not fair, it's not safe

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000
and it's not sustainable.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000
Now because the plastics are so plentiful --

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000
and by the way,

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000
those other methods don't lead to the recovery of plastics, obviously --

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000
but people do try to recover the plastics.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000
This is just one example.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000
This is a photo I took standing on the rooftops

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.000
of one of the largest slums in the world in Mumbai, India.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000
They store the plastics on the roofs.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.000
They bring them below those roofs into small workshops like these,

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.000
and people try very hard to separate the plastics,

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000
by color, by shape, by feel,

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.000
by any technique they can.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.000
And sometimes they'll resort to what's known as the "burn and sniff" technique

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000
where they'll burn the plastic and smell the fumes

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.000
to try to determine the type of plastic.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.000
None of these techniques result in any amount of recycling

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000
in any significant way.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000
And by the way,

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.000
please don't try this technique at home.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.000
So what are we to do about this space-age material,

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.000
at least what we used to call a space-aged material, these plastics?

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.000
Well I certainly believe that it's far too valuable and far too abundant

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000
to keep putting back in the ground

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000
or certainly send up in smoke.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.000
So about 20 years ago, I literally started in my garage tinkering around,

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000
trying to figure out how to separate

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.000
these very similar materials from each other,

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.000
and eventually enlisted a lot of my friends,

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.000
in the mining world actually, and in the plastics world,

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.000
and we started going around to mining laboratories around the world.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.000
Because after all, we're doing above-ground mining.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.000
And we eventually broke the code.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.000
This is the last frontier of recycling.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000
It's the last major material

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000
to be recovered in any significant amount on the Earth.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000
And we finally figured out how to do it.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.000
And in the process, we started recreating

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.000
how the plastics industry makes plastics.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.000
The traditional way to make plastics

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000
is with oil or petrochemicals.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.000
You breakdown the molecules, you recombine them in very specific ways,

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.000
to make all the wonderful plastics that we enjoy each and every day.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.000
We said, there's got to be a more sustainable way to make plastics.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.000
And not just sustainable from an environmental standpoint,

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.000
sustainable from an economic standpoint as well.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000
Well a good place to start is with waste.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.000
It certainly doesn't cost as much as oil,

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000
and it's plentiful,

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000
as I hope that you've been able to see from the photographs.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000
And because we're not breaking down the plastic into molecules

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.000
and recombining them,

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.000
we're using a mining approach to extract the materials.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000
We have significantly lower capital costs

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.000
in our plant equipment.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000
We have enormous energy savings.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.000
I don't know how many other projects on the planet right now

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.000
can save 80 to 90 percent of the energy

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.000
compared to making something the traditional way.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.000
And instead of plopping down several hundred million dollars

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.000
to build a chemical plant

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.000
that will only make one type of plastic for its entire life,

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:32.000
our plants can make any type of plastic we feed them.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.000
And we make a drop-in replacement

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000
for that plastic that's made from petrochemicals.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.000
Our customers get to enjoy

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.000
huge CO2 savings.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.000
They get to close the loop with their products.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.000
And they get to make more sustainable products.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.000
In the short time period I have,

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:49.000
I want to show you a little bit of a sense about how we do this.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:52.000
It starts with metal recyclers who shred our stuff into very small bits.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000
They recover the metals

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.000
and leave behind what's called shredder residue -- it's their waste --

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.000
a very complex mixture of materials,

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000
but predominantly plastics.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000
We take out the things that aren't plastics,

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:05.000
such as the metals they missed, carpeting, foam, rubber,

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:08.000
wood, glass, paper, you name it.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.000
Even an occasional dead animal, unfortunately.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:13.000
And it goes in the first part of our process here, which is more like traditional recycling.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.000
We're sieving the material, we're using magnets,

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.000
we're using air classification.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.000
It looks like the Willy Wonka factory at this point.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:22.000
At the end of this process, we have a mixed plastic composite:

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.000
many different types of plastics

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000
and many different grades of plastics.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000
This goes into the more sophisticated part of our process,

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:32.000
and the really hard work, multi-step separation process begins.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:35.000
We grind the plastic down to about the size of your small fingernail.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.000
We use a very highly automated process

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.000
to sort those plastics,

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.000
not only by type, but by grade.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.000
And out the end of that part of the process

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.000
come little flakes of plastic:

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.000
one type, one grade.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:50.000
We then use optical sorting to color sort this material.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:53.000
We blend it in 50,000-lb. blending silos.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:56.000
We push that material to extruders where we melt it,

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.000
push it through small die holes,

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.000
make spaghetti-like plastic strands.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000
And we chop those strands

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000
into what are called pellets.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:08.000
And this becomes the currency of the plastics industry.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:11.000
This is the same material

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.000
that you would get from oil.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.000
And today,

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:18.000
we're producing it from your old stuff,

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:21.000
and it's going right back into your new stuff.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:30.000
(Applause)

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.000
So now, instead of your stuff ending up

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.000
on a hillside in a developing country

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.000
or literally going up in smoke,

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.000
you can find your old stuff

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:41.000
back on top of your desk in new products,

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.000
in your office,

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.000
or back at work in your home.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.000
And these are just a few examples

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.000
of companies that are buying our plastic,

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.000
replacing virgin plastic,

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.000
to make their new products.

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.000
So I hope I've changed the way you look at

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.000
at least some of the stuff in your life.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.000
We took our clues from mother nature.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.000
Mother nature wastes very little,

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.000
reuses practically everything.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:06.000
And I hope that you stop looking at yourself as a consumer --

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:09.000
that's a label I've always hated my entire life --

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:13.000
and think of yourself as just using resources in one form,

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.000
until they can be transformed to another form

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:17.000
for another use later in time.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:20.000
And finally, I hope you agree with me

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:23.000
to change that last toddler rule just a little bit

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:26.000
to: "If it's broken, it's my stuff."

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.000
Thank you for your time.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:37.000
(Applause)
