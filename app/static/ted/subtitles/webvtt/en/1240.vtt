WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
I am a conductor,

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
and I'm here today

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
to talk to you about trust.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
My job depends upon it.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
There has to be, between me and the orchestra,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
an unshakable bond of trust,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
born out of mutual respect,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
through which we can spin a musical narrative

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
that we all believe in.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Now in the old days, conducting, music making,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
was less about trust and more, frankly, about coercion.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Up to and around about the Second World War,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
conductors were invariably dictators --

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
these tyrannical figures

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
who would rehearse, not just the orchestra as a whole, but individuals within it,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
within an inch of their lives.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
But I'm happy to say now that the world has moved on,

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
music has moved on with it.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
We now have a more democratic view and way of making music --

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
a two-way street.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
I, as the conductor, have to come to the rehearsal with a cast-iron sense

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
of the outer architecture of that music,

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
within which there is then immense personal freedom

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
for the members of the orchestra to shine.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
For myself, of course,

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000
I have to completely trust my body language.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
That's all I have at the point of sale.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
It's silent gesture.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
I can hardly bark out instructions while we're playing.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:24.000
(Music)

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
Ladies and gentlemen, the Scottish Ensemble.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:45.000
(Applause)

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
So in order for all this to work,

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
obviously I have got to be in a position of trust.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
I have to trust the orchestra,

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
and, even more crucially, I have to trust myself.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
Think about it: when you're in a position of not trusting,

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
what do you do?

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
You overcompensate.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
And in my game, that means you overgesticulate.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000
You end up like some kind of rabid windmill.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000
And the bigger your gesture gets,

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000
the more ill-defined, blurry

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
and, frankly, useless it is to the orchestra.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000
You become a figure of fun. There's no trust anymore, only ridicule.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
And I remember at the beginning of my career,

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
again and again, on these dismal outings with orchestras,

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000
I would be going completely insane on the podium,

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
trying to engender a small scale crescendo really,

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000
just a little upsurge in volume.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000
Bugger me, they wouldn't give it to me.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
I spent a lot of time in those early years

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000
weeping silently in dressing rooms.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.000
And how futile seemed the words of advice to me

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000
from great British veteran conductor Sir Colin Davis

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000
who said, "Conducting, Charles,

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000
is like holding a small bird in your hand.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.000
If you hold it too tightly, you crush it.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.000
If you hold it too loosely, it flies away."

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000
I have to say, in those days, I couldn't really even find the bird.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000
Now a fundamental

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.000
and really viscerally important experience for me, in terms of music,

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000
has been my adventures in South Africa,

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
the most dizzyingly musical country on the planet in my view,

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
but a country which, through its musical culture,

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.000
has taught me one fundamental lesson:

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000
that through music making

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000
can come deep levels

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000
of fundamental life-giving trust.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000
Back in 2000, I had the opportunity to go to South Africa

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000
to form a new opera company.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000
So I went out there, and I auditioned,

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000
mainly in rural township locations, right around the country.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000
I heard about 2,000 singers

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000
and pulled together a company

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.000
of 40 of the most jaw-droppingly amazing young performers,

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000
the majority of whom were black,

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000
but there were a handful of white performers.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000
Now it emerged early on in the first rehearsal period

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000
that one of those white performers

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000
had, in his previous incarnation,

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000
been a member of the South African police force.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000
And in the last years of the old regime,

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.000
he would routinely be detailed to go into the township

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000
to aggress the community.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.000
Now you can imagine what this knowledge did to the temperature in the room,

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000
the general atmosphere.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000
Let's be under no illusions.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000
In South Africa, the relationship most devoid of trust

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000
is that between a white policeman

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000
and the black community.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000
So how do we recover from that, ladies and gentlemen?

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000
Simply through singing.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.000
We sang, we sang,

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000
we sang,

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000
and amazingly new trust grew,

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000
and indeed friendship blossomed.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000
And that showed me such a fundamental truth,

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.000
that music making and other forms of creativity

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000
can so often go to places

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.000
where mere words cannot.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000
So we got some shows off the ground. We started touring them internationally.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000
One of them was "Carmen."

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000
We then thought we'd make a movie of "Carmen,"

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000
which we recorded and shot outside on location

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000
in the township outside Cape Town called Khayelitsha.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.000
The piece was sung entirely in Xhosa,

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.000
which is a beautifully musical language, if you don't know it.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.000
It's called "U-Carmen e-Khayelitsha" --

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000
literally "Carmen of Khayelitsha."

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000
I want to play you a tiny clip of it now

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.000
for no other reason than to give you proof positive

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.000
that there is nothing tiny about South African music making.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:58.000
(Music)

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:07.000
(Applause)

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:10.000
Something which I find utterly enchanting

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.000
about South African music making

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.000
is that it's so free.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.000
South Africans just make music really freely.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.000
And I think, in no small way,

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.000
that's due to one fundamental fact:

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.000
they're not bound to a system of notation.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.000
They don't read music.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.000
They trust their ears.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.000
You can teach a bunch of South Africans a tune in about five seconds flat.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000
And then, as if by magic,

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:34.000
they will spontaneously improvise a load of harmony around that tune

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000
because they can.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.000
Now those of us that live in the West, if I can use that term,

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.000
I think have a much more hidebound attitude or sense of music --

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:45.000
that somehow it's all about skill and systems.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.000
Therefore it's the exclusive preserve

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.000
of an elite, talented body.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:53.000
And yet, ladies and gentlemen, every single one of us on this planet

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:56.000
probably engages with music on a daily basis.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.000
And if I can broaden this out for a second,

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:01.000
I'm willing to bet that every single one of you sitting in this room

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.000
would be happy to speak with acuity, with total confidence,

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.000
about movies, probably about literature.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:09.000
But how many of you would be able to make a confident assertion

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:12.000
about a piece of classical music?

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.000
Why is this?

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.000
And what I'm going to say to you now

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.000
is I'm just urging you to get over

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.000
this supreme lack of self-confidence,

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:23.000
to take the plunge, to believe that you can trust your ears,

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.000
you can hear some of the fundamental muscle tissue,

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.000
fiber, DNA,

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:30.000
what makes a great piece of music great.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000
I've got a little experiment I want to try with you.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.000
Did you know

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.000
that TED is a tune?

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.000
A very simple tune based on three notes -- T, E, D.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.000
Now hang on a minute.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:44.000
I know you're going to say to me, "T doesn't exist in music."

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000
Well ladies and gentlemen, there's a time-honored system,

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.000
which composers have been using for hundreds of years,

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.000
which proves actually that it does.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:55.000
If I sing you a musical scale: A, B, C, D, E, F, G --

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:58.000
and I just carry on with the next set of letters in the alphabet, same scale:

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:01.000
H, I, J, K, L, M, N,

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.000
O, P, Q, R, S, T -- there you go.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.000
T, see it's the same as F in music.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.000
So T is F.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.000
So T, E, D is the same as F, E, D.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.000
Now that piece of music that we played at the start of this session

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.000
had enshrined in its heart

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.000
the theme, which is TED.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.000
Have a listen.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:26.000
(Music)

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.000
Do you hear it?

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.000
Or do I smell some doubt in the room?

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.000
Okay, we'll play it for you again now,

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:35.000
and we're going to highlight, we're going to poke out the T, E, D.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:38.000
If you'll pardon the expression.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:45.000
(Music)

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:48.000
Oh my goodness me, there it was loud and clear, surely.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:49.000
I think we should make this even more explicit.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.000
Ladies and gentlemen, it's nearly time for tea.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.000
Would you reckon you need to sing for your tea, I think?

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.000
I think we need to sing for our tea.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:58.000
We're going to sing those three wonderful notes: T, E, D.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.000
Will you have a go for me?

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.000
Audience: T, E, D.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:05.000
Charles Hazlewood: Yeah, you sound a bit more like cows really than human beings.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.000
Shall we try that one again?

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.000
And look, if you're adventurous, you go up the octave.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.000
T, E, D.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.000
Audience: T, E, D.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:16.000
CH: Once more with vim. (Audience: T, E, D.)

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.000
There I am like a bloody windmill again, you see.

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:21.000
Now we're going to put that in the context of the music.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:24.000
The music will start, and then at a signal from me, you will sing that.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:30.000
(Music)

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.000
One more time,

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.000
with feeling, ladies and gentlemen.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:45.000
You won't make the key otherwise.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.000
Well done, ladies and gentlemen.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:50.000
It wasn't a bad debut for the TED choir,

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:53.000
not a bad debut at all.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.000
Now there's a project that I'm initiating at the moment

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.000
that I'm very excited about and wanted to share with you,

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.000
because it is all about changing perceptions,

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:02.000
and, indeed, building a new level of trust.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:05.000
The youngest of my children was born with cerebral palsy,

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:07.000
which as you can imagine,

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.000
if you don't have an experience of it yourself,

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.000
is quite a big thing to take on board.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:14.000
But the gift that my gorgeous daughter has given me,

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.000
aside from her very existence,

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:19.000
is that it's opened my eyes to a whole stretch of the community

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.000
that was hitherto hidden,

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.000
the community of disabled people.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:26.000
And I found myself looking at the Paralympics and thinking how incredible

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:29.000
how technology's been harnessed to prove beyond doubt

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.000
that disability is no barrier

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:33.000
to the highest levels of sporting achievement.

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.000
Of course there's a grimmer side to that truth,

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:38.000
which is that it's actually taken decades for the world at large

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:41.000
to come to a position of trust,

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:44.000
to really believe that disability and sports can go together

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:47.000
in a convincing and interesting fashion.

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.000
So I find myself asking:

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.000
where is music in all of this?

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.000
You can't tell me that there aren't millions of disabled people,

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.000
in the U.K. alone,

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:58.000
with massive musical potential.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:01.000
So I decided to create a platform for that potential.

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.000
It's going to be Britain's first ever

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:05.000
national disabled orchestra.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:07.000
It's called Paraorchestra.

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:09.000
I'm going to show you a clip now

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:11.000
of the very first improvisation session that we had.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.000
It was a really extraordinary moment.

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:16.000
Just me and four astonishingly gifted disabled musicians.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:19.000
Normally when you improvise --

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:21.000
and I do it all the time around the world --

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:23.000
there's this initial period of horror,

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:25.000
like everyone's too frightened to throw the hat into the ring,

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.000
an awful pregnant silence.

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:29.000
Then suddenly, as if by magic, bang! We're all in there

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:31.000
and it's complete bedlam. You can't hear anything.

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:33.000
No one's listening. No one's trusting.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:36.000
No one's responding to each other.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.000
Now in this room with these four disabled musicians,

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.000
within five minutes

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:42.000
a rapt listening, a rapt response

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:45.000
and some really insanely beautiful music.

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:55.000
(Video) (Music)

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.000
Nicholas:: My name's Nicholas McCarthy.

00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:59.000
I'm 22, and I'm a left-handed pianist.

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:02.000
And I was born without my left hand -- right hand.

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:05.000
Can I do that one again?

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:12.000
(Music)

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.000
Lyn: When I'm making music,

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:17.000
I feel like a pilot in the cockpit flying an airplane.

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:19.000
I become alive.

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:30.000
(Music)

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:33.000
Clarence: I would rather be able to play an instrument again

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:35.000
than walk.

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:37.000
There's so much joy and things

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:41.000
I could get from playing an instrument and performing.

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:45.000
It's removed some of my paralysis.

00:13:45.000 --> 00:14:00.000
(Music)

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:07.000
(Applause)

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:10.000
CH: I only wish that some of those musicians were here with us today,

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:13.000
so you could see at firsthand how utterly extraordinary they are.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:15.000
Paraorchestra is the name of that project.

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:17.000
If any of you thinks you want to help me in any way

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:20.000
to achieve what is a fairly impossible and implausible dream still at this point,

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:22.000
please let me know.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:24.000
Now my parting shot

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.000
comes courtesy of the great Joseph Haydn,

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:29.000
wonderful Austrian composer in the second half of the 18th century --

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:31.000
spent the bulk of his life

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:34.000
in the employ of Prince Nikolaus Esterhazy, along with his orchestra.

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:37.000
Now this prince loved his music,

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:40.000
but he also loved the country castle that he tended to reside in most of the time,

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.000
which is just on the Austro-Hungarian border,

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:44.000
a place called Esterhazy --

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.000
a long way from the big city of Vienna.

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.000
Now one day in 1772,

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:50.000
the prince decreed that the musicians' families,

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:52.000
the orchestral musicians' families,

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:54.000
were no longer welcome in the castle.

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:57.000
They weren't allowed to stay there anymore; they had to be returned to Vienna --

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:00.000
as I say, an unfeasibly long way away in those days.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:04.000
You can imagine, the musicians were disconsolate.

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:07.000
Haydn remonstrated with the prince, but to no avail.

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:09.000
So given the prince loved his music,

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:12.000
Haydn thought he'd write a symphony to make the point.

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:15.000
And we're going to play just the very tail end of this symphony now.

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:18.000
And you'll see the orchestra in a kind of sullen revolt.

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.000
I'm pleased to say, the prince did take the tip

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:22.000
from the orchestral performance,

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:24.000
and the musicians were reunited with their families.

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:27.000
But I think it sums up my talk rather well, this,

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:29.000
that where there is trust,

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:32.000
there is music -- by extension life.

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:34.000
Where there is no trust,

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:37.000
the music quite simply withers away.

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:51.000
(Music)

00:18:51.000 --> 00:19:14.000
(Applause)
