00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
What is going on

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
in this baby's mind?

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
If you'd asked people this 30 years ago,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
most people, including psychologists,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
would have said that this baby was irrational,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
illogical, egocentric --

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
that he couldn't take the perspective of another person

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
or understand cause and effect.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
In the last 20 years,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
developmental science has completely overturned that picture.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
So in some ways,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
we think that this baby's thinking

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
is like the thinking of the most brilliant scientists.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Let me give you just one example of this.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
One thing that this baby could be thinking about,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
that could be going on in his mind,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
is trying to figure out

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
what's going on in the mind of that other baby.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
After all, one of the things that's hardest for all of us to do

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
is to figure out what other people are thinking and feeling.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
And maybe the hardest thing of all

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
is to figure out that what other people think and feel

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
isn't actually exactly like what we think and feel.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
Anyone who's followed politics can testify

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
to how hard that is for some people to get.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
We wanted to know

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
if babies and young children

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
could understand this really profound thing about other people.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
Now the question is: How could we ask them?

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
Babies, after all, can't talk,

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
and if you ask a three year-old

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
to tell you what he thinks,

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
what you'll get is a beautiful stream of consciousness monologue

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
about ponies and birthdays and things like that.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
So how do we actually ask them the question?

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
Well it turns out that the secret was broccoli.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.000
What we did -- Betty Rapacholi, who was one of my students, and I --

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
was actually to give the babies two bowls of food:

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
one bowl of raw broccoli

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
and one bowl of delicious goldfish crackers.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
Now all of the babies, even in Berkley,

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
like the crackers and don't like the raw broccoli.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
(Laughter)

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
But then what Betty did

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000
was to take a little taste of food from each bowl.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
And she would act as if she liked it or she didn't.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
So half the time, she acted

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
as if she liked the crackers and didn't like the broccoli --

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
just like a baby and any other sane person.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
But half the time,

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
what she would do is take a little bit of the broccoli

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000
and go, "Mmmmm, broccoli.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000
I tasted the broccoli. Mmmmm."

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
And then she would take a little bit of the crackers,

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.000
and she'd go, "Eww, yuck, crackers.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000
I tasted the crackers. Eww, yuck."

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
So she'd act as if what she wanted

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000
was just the opposite of what the babies wanted.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
We did this with 15 and 18 month-old babies.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
And then she would simply put her hand out and say,

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
"Can you give me some?"

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
So the question is: What would the baby give her,

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
what they liked or what she liked?

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
And the remarkable thing was that 18 month-old babies,

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
just barely walking and talking,

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000
would give her the crackers if she liked the crackers,

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000
but they would give her the broccoli if she liked the broccoli.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
On the other hand,

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
15 month-olds would stare at her for a long time

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
if she acted as if she liked the broccoli,

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000
like they couldn't figure this out.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
But then after they stared for a long time,

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
they would just give her the crackers,

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
what they thought everybody must like.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000
So there are two really remarkable things about this.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000
The first one is that these little 18 month-old babies

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
have already discovered

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000
this really profound fact about human nature,

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
that we don't always want the same thing.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
And what's more, they felt that they should actually do things

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000
to help other people get what they wanted.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
Even more remarkably though,

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000
the fact that 15 month-olds didn't do this

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000
suggests that these 18 month-olds had learned

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
this deep, profound fact about human nature

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000
in the three months from when they were 15 months old.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000
So children both know more and learn more

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000
than we ever would have thought.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.000
And this is just one of hundreds and hundreds of studies over the last 20 years

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000
that's actually demonstrated it.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000
The question you might ask though is:

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000
Why do children learn so much?

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000
And how is it possible for them to learn so much

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000
in such a short time?

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000
I mean, after all, if you look at babies superficially,

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000
they seem pretty useless.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.000
And actually in many ways, they're worse than useless,

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
because we have to put so much time and energy

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000
into just keeping them alive.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000
But if we turn to evolution

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000
for an answer to this puzzle

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000
of why we spend so much time

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000
taking care of useless babies,

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000
it turns out that there's actually an answer.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000
If we look across many, many different species of animals,

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000
not just us primates,

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000
but also including other mammals, birds,

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000
even marsupials

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000
like kangaroos and wombats,

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
it turns out that there's a relationship

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.000
between how long a childhood a species has

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.000
and how big their brains are compared to their bodies

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000
and how smart and flexible they are.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.000
And sort of the posterbirds for this idea are the birds up there.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000
On one side

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000
is a New Caledonian crow.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000
And crows and other corvidae, ravens, rooks and so forth,

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000
are incredibly smart birds.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.000
They're as smart as chimpanzees in some respects.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000
And this is a bird on the cover of science

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.000
who's learned how to use a tool to get food.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000
On the other hand,

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000
we have our friend the domestic chicken.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.000
And chickens and ducks and geese and turkeys

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000
are basically as dumb as dumps.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.000
So they're very, very good at pecking for grain,

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.000
and they're not much good at doing anything else.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000
Well it turns out that the babies,

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000
the New Caledonian crow babies, are fledglings.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000
They depend on their moms

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.000
to drop worms in their little open mouths

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000
for as long as two years,

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000
which is a really long time in the life of a bird.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000
Whereas the chickens are actually mature

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000
within a couple of months.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000
So childhood is the reason

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.000
why the crows end up on the cover of Science

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000
and the chickens end up in the soup pot.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.000
There's something about that long childhood

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000
that seems to be connected

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.000
to knowledge and learning.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.000
Well what kind of explanation could we have for this?

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.000
Well some animals, like the chicken,

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000
seem to be beautifully suited

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.000
to doing just one thing very well.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.000
So they seem to be beautifully suited

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.000
to pecking grain in one environment.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000
Other creatures, like the crows,

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.000
aren't very good at doing anything in particular,

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000
but they're extremely good

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000
at learning about laws of different environments.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.000
And of course, we human beings

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.000
are way out on the end of the distribution like the crows.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000
We have bigger brains relative to our bodies

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.000
by far than any other animal.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.000
We're smarter, we're more flexible,

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000
we can learn more,

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000
we survive in more different environments,

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.000
we migrated to cover the world and even go to outer space.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:28.000
And our babies and children are dependent on us

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.000
for much longer than the babies of any other species.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.000
My son is 23.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.000
(Laughter)

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.000
And at least until they're 23,

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000
we're still popping those worms

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.000
into those little open mouths.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.000
All right, why would we see this correlation?

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:49.000
Well an idea is that that strategy, that learning strategy,

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:52.000
is an extremely powerful, great strategy for getting on in the world,

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000
but it has one big disadvantage.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000
And that one big disadvantage

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.000
is that, until you actually do all that learning,

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000
you're going to be helpless.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:04.000
So you don't want to have the mastodon charging at you

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.000
and be saying to yourself,

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:10.000
"A slingshot or maybe a spear might work. Which would actually be better?"

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.000
You want to know all that

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.000
before the mastodons actually show up.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.000
And the way the evolutions seems to have solved that problem

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.000
is with a kind of division of labor.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:22.000
So the idea is that we have this early period when we're completely protected.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:25.000
We don't have to do anything. All we have to do is learn.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.000
And then as adults,

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.000
we can take all those things that we learned when we were babies and children

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.000
and actually put them to work to do things out there in the world.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.000
So one way of thinking about it

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.000
is that babies and young children

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:40.000
are like the research and development division of the human species.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.000
So they're the protected blue sky guys

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.000
who just have to go out and learn and have good ideas,

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.000
and we're production and marketing.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.000
We have to take all those ideas

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.000
that we learned when we were children

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.000
and actually put them to use.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.000
Another way of thinking about it

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.000
is instead of thinking of babies and children

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.000
as being like defective grownups,

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.000
we should think about them

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.000
as being a different developmental stage of the same species --

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.000
kind of like caterpillars and butterflies --

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.000
except that they're actually the brilliant butterflies

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:11.000
who are flitting around the garden and exploring,

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.000
and we're the caterpillars

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:16.000
who are inching along our narrow, grownup, adult path.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:19.000
If this is true, if these babies are designed to learn --

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:22.000
and this evolutionary story would say children are for learning,

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.000
that's what they're for --

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000
we might expect

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000
that they would have really powerful learning mechanisms.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.000
And in fact, the baby's brain

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.000
seems to be the most powerful learning computer

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.000
on the planet.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:38.000
But real computers are actually getting to be a lot better.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.000
And there's been a revolution

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000
in our understanding of machine learning recently.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.000
And it all depends on the ideas of this guy,

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.000
the Reverend Thomas Bayes,

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:50.000
who was a statistician and mathematician in the 18th century.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:53.000
And essentially what Bayes did

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.000
was to provide a mathematical way

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.000
using probability theory

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.000
to characterize, describe,

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.000
the way that scientists find out about the world.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.000
So what scientists do

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:06.000
is they have a hypothesis that they think might be likely to start with.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.000
They go out and test it against the evidence.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.000
The evidence makes them change that hypothesis.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.000
Then they test that new hypothesis

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.000
and so on and so forth.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:17.000
And what Bayes showed was a mathematical way that you could do that.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.000
And that mathematics is at the core

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.000
of the best machine learning programs that we have now.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.000
And some 10 years ago,

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:27.000
I suggested that babies might be doing the same thing.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.000
So if you want to know what's going on

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.000
underneath those beautiful brown eyes,

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.000
I think it actually looks something like this.

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.000
This is Reverend Bayes's notebook.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:38.000
So I think those babies are actually making complicated calculations

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:41.000
with conditional probabilities that they're revising

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.000
to figure out how the world works.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:47.000
All right, now that might seem like an even taller order to actually demonstrate.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.000
Because after all, if you ask even grownups about statistics,

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.000
they look extremely stupid.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:54.000
How could it be that children are doing statistics?

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.000
So to test this we used a machine that we have

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.000
called the Blicket Detector.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.000
This is a box that lights up and plays music

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.000
when you put some things on it and not others.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.000
And using this very simple machine,

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.000
my lab and others have done dozens of studies

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.000
showing just how good babies are

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.000
at learning about the world.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.000
Let me mention just one

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.000
that we did with Tumar Kushner, my student.

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:17.000
If I showed you this detector,

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.000
you would be likely to think to begin with

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.000
that the way to make the detector go

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:24.000
would be to put a block on top of the detector.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.000
But actually, this detector

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.000
works in a bit of a strange way.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:31.000
Because if you wave a block over the top of the detector,

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:34.000
something you wouldn't ever think of to begin with,

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:37.000
the detector will actually activate two out of three times.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:40.000
Whereas, if you do the likely thing, put the block on the detector,

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:44.000
it will only activate two out of six times.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.000
So the unlikely hypothesis

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.000
actually has stronger evidence.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.000
It looks as if the waving

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.000
is a more effective strategy than the other strategy.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:55.000
So we did just this; we gave four year-olds this pattern of evidence,

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.000
and we just asked them to make it go.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:00.000
And sure enough, the four year-olds used the evidence

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:03.000
to wave the object on top of the detector.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:06.000
Now there are two things that are really interesting about this.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:09.000
The first one is, again, remember, these are four year-olds.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.000
They're just learning how to count.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.000
But unconsciously,

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.000
they're doing these quite complicated calculations

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:18.000
that will give them a conditional probability measure.

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.000
And the other interesting thing

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.000
is that they're using that evidence

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:25.000
to get to an idea, get to a hypothesis about the world,

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:28.000
that seems very unlikely to begin with.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:31.000
And in studies we've just been doing in my lab, similar studies,

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:33.000
we've show that four year-olds are actually better

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:36.000
at finding out an unlikely hypothesis

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:39.000
than adults are when we give them exactly the same task.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.000
So in these circumstances,

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:44.000
the children are using statistics to find out about the world,

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:47.000
but after all, scientists also do experiments,

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:50.000
and we wanted to see if children are doing experiments.

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:53.000
When children do experiments we call it "getting into everything"

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.000
or else "playing."

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:58.000
And there's been a bunch of interesting studies recently

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:01.000
that have shown this playing around

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.000
is really a kind of experimental research program.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:06.000
Here's one from Cristine Legare's lab.

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:09.000
What Cristine did was use our Blicket Detectors.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:11.000
And what she did was show children

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.000
that yellow ones made it go and red ones didn't,

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:16.000
and then she showed them an anomaly.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.000
And what you'll see

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:21.000
is that this little boy will go through five hypotheses

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:24.000
in the space of two minutes.

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:27.000
(Video) Boy: How about this?

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:31.000
Same as the other side.

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:35.000
Alison Gopnik: Okay, so his first hypothesis has just been falsified.

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:42.000
(Laughter)

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:45.000
Boy: This one lighted up, and this one nothing.

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:48.000
AG: Okay, he's got his experimental notebook out.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:55.000
Boy: What's making this light up.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:05.000
(Laughter)

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:07.000
I don't know.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:11.000
AG: Every scientist will recognize that expression of despair.

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:14.000
(Laughter)

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:20.000
Boy: Oh, it's because this needs to be like this,

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.000
and this needs to be like this.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:25.000
AG: Okay, hypothesis two.

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:27.000
Boy: That's why.

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:29.000
Oh.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:34.000
(Laughter)

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:36.000
AG: Now this is his next idea.

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.000
He told the experimenter to do this,

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:42.000
to try putting it out onto the other location.

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.000
Not working either.

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:51.000
Boy: Oh, because the light goes only to here,

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:54.000
not here.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:57.000
Oh, the bottom of this box

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:59.000
has electricity in here,

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:01.000
but this doesn't have electricity.

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:03.000
AG: Okay, that's a fourth hypothesis.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:05.000
Boy: It's lighting up.

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:10.000
So when you put four.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:14.000
So you put four on this one to make it light up

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.000
and two on this one to make it light up.

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.000
AG: Okay,there's his fifth hypothesis.

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:21.000
Now that is a particularly --

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:24.000
that is a particularly adorable and articulate little boy,

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:27.000
but what Cristine discovered is this is actually quite typical.

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:30.000
If you look at the way children play, when you ask them to explain something,

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:33.000
what they really do is do a series of experiments.

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:36.000
This is actually pretty typical of four year-olds.

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:39.000
Well, what's it like to be this kind of creature?

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:42.000
What's it like to be one of these brilliant butterflies

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:45.000
who can test five hypotheses in two minutes?

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:48.000
Well, if you go back to those psychologists and philosophers,

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:50.000
a lot of them have said

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:52.000
that babies and young children were barely conscious

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:54.000
if they were conscious at all.

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:56.000
And I think just the opposite is true.

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:59.000
I think babies and children are actually more conscious than we are as adults.

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:02.000
Now here's what we know about how adult consciousness works.

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:04.000
And adults' attention and consciousness

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:06.000
look kind of like a spotlight.

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:08.000
So what happens for adults

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:10.000
is we decide that something's relevant or important,

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:12.000
we should pay attention to it.

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:14.000
Our consciousness of that thing that we're attending to

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:17.000
becomes extremely bright and vivid,

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:19.000
and everything else sort of goes dark.

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:22.000
And we even know something about the way the brain does this.

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:24.000
So what happens when we pay attention

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:27.000
is that the prefrontal cortex, the sort of executive part of our brains,

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:29.000
sends a signal

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:31.000
that makes a little part of our brain much more flexible,

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:33.000
more plastic, better at learning,

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:35.000
and shuts down activity

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:37.000
in all the rest of our brains.

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:41.000
So we have a very focused, purpose-driven kind of attention.

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:43.000
If we look at babies and young children,

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:45.000
we see something very different.

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:47.000
I think babies and young children

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:49.000
seem to have more of a lantern of consciousness

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:51.000
than a spotlight of consciousness.

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:54.000
So babies and young children are very bad

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:57.000
at narrowing down to just one thing.

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:00.000
But they're very good at taking in lots of information

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:02.000
from lots of different sources at once.

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:04.000
And if you actually look in their brains,

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:07.000
you see that they're flooded with these neurotransmitters

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:09.000
that are really good at inducing learning and plasticity,

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:12.000
and the inhibitory parts haven't come on yet.

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:14.000
So when we say that babies and young children

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:16.000
are bad at paying attention,

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:20.000
what we really mean is that they're bad at not paying attention.

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:22.000
So they're bad at getting rid

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:24.000
of all the interesting things that could tell them something

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:26.000
and just looking at the thing that's important.

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:29.000
That's the kind of attention, the kind of consciousness,

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:31.000
that we might expect

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:33.000
from those butterflies who are designed to learn.

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:35.000
Well if we want to think about a way

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:39.000
of getting a taste of that kind of baby consciousness as adults,

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:41.000
I think the best thing is think about cases

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:44.000
where we're put in a new situation that we've never been in before --

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:46.000
when we fall in love with someone new,

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:49.000
or when we're in a new city for the first time.

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:51.000
And what happens then is not that our consciousness contracts,

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:53.000
it expands,

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:55.000
so that those three days in Paris

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:57.000
seem to be more full of consciousness and experience

00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:59.000
than all the months of being

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:03.000
a walking, talking, faculty meeting-attending zombie back home.

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:05.000
And by the way, that coffee,

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:07.000
that wonderful coffee you've been drinking downstairs,

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:09.000
actually mimics the effect

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:11.000
of those baby neurotransmitters.

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:13.000
So what's it like to be a baby?

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:15.000
It's like being in love

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:17.000
in Paris for the first time

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:19.000
after you've had three double-espressos.

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:22.000
(Laughter)

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:24.000
That's a fantastic way to be,

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:28.000
but it does tend to leave you waking up crying at three o'clock in the morning.

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:31.000
(Laughter)

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:33.000
Now it's good to be a grownup.

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:35.000
I don't want to say too much about how wonderful babies are.

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:37.000
It's good to be a grownup.

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:40.000
We can do things like tie our shoelaces and cross the street by ourselves.

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:42.000
And it makes sense that we put a lot of effort

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:46.000
into making babies think like adults do.

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:49.000
But if what we want is to be like those butterflies,

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:52.000
to have open-mindedness, open learning,

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:54.000
imagination, creativity, innovation,

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:56.000
maybe at least some of the time

00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:58.000
we should be getting the adults

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:00.000
to start thinking more like children.

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:08.000
(Applause)
