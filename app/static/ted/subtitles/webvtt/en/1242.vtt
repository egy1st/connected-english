00:00:00.364 --> 00:00:05.426
I'm here to talk to you about
a new way of doing journalism.

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:08.063
Some people call this
"citizen journalism,"

00:00:08.087 --> 00:00:10.400
other people call it
"collaborative journalism."

00:00:10.424 --> 00:00:15.604
But really, it kind of means this:
for the journalists, people like me,

00:00:15.628 --> 00:00:18.804
it means accepting
that you can't know everything,

00:00:18.828 --> 00:00:21.386
and allowing other people,
through technology,

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:23.282
to be your eyes and your ears.

00:00:24.048 --> 00:00:27.600
And for people like you,
for other members of the public,

00:00:27.624 --> 00:00:30.949
it can mean not just being
the passive consumers of news,

00:00:30.973 --> 00:00:32.430
but also coproducing news.

00:00:33.232 --> 00:00:36.104
And I believe this can be
a really empowering process.

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:41.923
It can enable ordinary people
to hold powerful organizations to account.

00:00:42.428 --> 00:00:45.524
So I'm going to explain this
to you today with two cases,

00:00:45.548 --> 00:00:47.412
two stories that I've investigated.

00:00:47.898 --> 00:00:50.501
And they both involve
controversial deaths.

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:56.405
And in both cases, the authorities
put out an official version of events,

00:00:56.429 --> 00:00:58.038
which was somewhat misleading.

00:00:58.598 --> 00:01:03.086
We were able to tell an alternative truth
utilizing new technology,

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:05.814
utilizing social media,
particularly Twitter.

00:01:06.306 --> 00:01:09.916
Essentially, what I'm talking about here
is, as I said, citizen journalism.

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:11.354
So, to take the first case:

00:01:11.875 --> 00:01:15.035
this is Ian Tomlinson,
the man in the foreground.

00:01:15.059 --> 00:01:18.127
He was a newspaper vendor from London,

00:01:18.151 --> 00:01:24.578
and on the 1st of April 2009,
he died at the G20 protests in London.

00:01:25.062 --> 00:01:27.125
Now, he had been -- he wasn't a protester,

00:01:27.149 --> 00:01:29.357
he'd been trying to find
his way home from work

00:01:29.381 --> 00:01:30.755
through the demonstrations.

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:32.876
But he didn't get home.

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:34.924
He had an encounter with a man behind him,

00:01:34.948 --> 00:01:39.076
and as you can see, the man behind him
has covered his face with a balaclava.

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:41.536
And, in fact, he wasn't showing
his badge numbers.

00:01:41.872 --> 00:01:44.766
But I can tell you now,
he was PC Simon Harwood,

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:48.206
a police officer with London's
Metropolitan Police Force.

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:51.460
In fact, he belonged
to the elite territorial support group.

00:01:52.063 --> 00:01:57.396
Now, moments after this image was shot,
Harwood struck Tomlinson with a baton,

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.300
and he pushed him to ground,

00:01:59.324 --> 00:02:01.393
and Tomlinson died moments later.

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:05.331
But that wasn't the story
the police wanted us to tell.

00:02:05.777 --> 00:02:09.026
Initially, through official statements
and off-the-record briefings,

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:13.230
they said that Ian Tomlinson
had died of natural causes.

00:02:14.002 --> 00:02:17.196
They said that there had been
no contact with the police,

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:19.562
that there were no marks on his body.

00:02:19.586 --> 00:02:22.950
In fact, they said that when police
tried to resuscitate him,

00:02:22.974 --> 00:02:26.183
the police medics
were impeded from doing so,

00:02:26.207 --> 00:02:30.703
because protesters were throwing missiles,
believed to be bottles, at police.

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:34.348
And the result of that
were stories like this.

00:02:34.788 --> 00:02:36.635
I show you this slide,

00:02:36.659 --> 00:02:39.986
because this was the newspaper
that Ian Tomlinson had been selling

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:41.622
for 20 years of his life.

00:02:41.646 --> 00:02:44.508
And if any news organization
had an obligation

00:02:44.532 --> 00:02:47.231
to properly forensically analyze
what had been going on,

00:02:47.255 --> 00:02:49.082
it was the Evening Standard newspaper.

00:02:49.106 --> 00:02:52.611
But they, like everyone else --
including my news organization --

00:02:52.635 --> 00:02:56.291
were misled by the official
version of events put out by police.

00:02:56.315 --> 00:02:58.056
But you can see here,

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:00.722
the bottles that were supposedly
being thrown at police

00:03:00.746 --> 00:03:01.897
were turned into bricks

00:03:01.921 --> 00:03:04.570
by the time they reached
this edition of the newspaper.

00:03:04.594 --> 00:03:05.745
So we were suspicious,

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:08.218
and we wanted to see if there
was more to the story.

00:03:08.242 --> 00:03:10.890
We needed to find those protesters
you see in the image,

00:03:10.914 --> 00:03:14.293
but, of course, they had vanished
by the time we started investigating.

00:03:14.317 --> 00:03:15.930
So how do you find the witnesses?

00:03:15.954 --> 00:03:18.248
This is, for me,
where it got really interesting.

00:03:18.272 --> 00:03:19.515
We turned to the internet.

00:03:19.539 --> 00:03:21.933
This is Twitter;
you've heard a lot about it today.

00:03:21.957 --> 00:03:25.067
Essentially, for me,
when I began investigating this case,

00:03:25.091 --> 00:03:28.001
I was completely new to this;
I'd signed up two days earlier.

00:03:28.025 --> 00:03:31.229
I discovered that Twitter
was a microblogging site.

00:03:31.253 --> 00:03:35.373
It enabled me to send out
short, 140-character messages.

00:03:35.397 --> 00:03:37.638
Also, an amazing search facility.

00:03:38.216 --> 00:03:42.592
But it was a social arena
in which other people were gathering

00:03:42.616 --> 00:03:44.086
with a common motive.

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:47.386
And in this case,
independently of journalists,

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:52.086
people themselves were interrogating
exactly what had happened to Ian Tomlinson

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:55.644
in his last 30 minutes of life.

00:03:56.768 --> 00:03:58.434
Individuals like these two guys.

00:03:59.038 --> 00:04:02.422
They went to Ian Tomlinson's aid
after he collapsed.

00:04:03.411 --> 00:04:05.185
They phoned the ambulance.

00:04:05.209 --> 00:04:08.480
They didn't see any bottles,
they didn't see any bricks.

00:04:08.971 --> 00:04:12.084
So they were concerned
that the stories weren't quite as accurate

00:04:12.108 --> 00:04:13.929
as police were claiming them to be.

00:04:13.953 --> 00:04:16.766
And again, through social media,
we started encountering

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:20.492
individuals with material like this:
photographs, evidence.

00:04:20.516 --> 00:04:24.190
Now, this does not show the attack
on Ian Tomlinson,

00:04:24.214 --> 00:04:26.259
but he appears to be in some distress.

00:04:26.746 --> 00:04:28.586
Was he drunk? Did he fall over?

00:04:29.024 --> 00:04:32.193
Did this have anything to do
with the police officers next to him?

00:04:32.217 --> 00:04:34.040
Here he appears to be talking to them.

00:04:34.064 --> 00:04:38.585
For us, this was enough
to investigate further, to dig deeper.

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:44.566
The result was putting out
stories ourselves.

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:47.241
One of the most amazing things
about the internet is:

00:04:47.265 --> 00:04:50.443
the information that people put out
is freely available to anyone,

00:04:50.467 --> 00:04:51.618
as we all know.

00:04:51.642 --> 00:04:53.786
That doesn't just go
for citizen journalists,

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:56.955
or for people putting out messages
on Facebook or Twitter.

00:04:56.979 --> 00:04:58.775
That goes for journalists themselves,

00:04:58.799 --> 00:04:59.952
people like me.

00:04:59.976 --> 00:05:04.215
As long as your news is the right side
of a paywall, i.e, it's free,

00:05:04.239 --> 00:05:05.860
anybody can access it.

00:05:05.884 --> 00:05:07.055
And stories like these,

00:05:07.079 --> 00:05:09.638
which were questioning
the official version of events,

00:05:09.662 --> 00:05:11.216
which were skeptical in tone,

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:14.996
allowed people to realize
that we had questions ourselves.

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:16.478
They were online magnets.

00:05:16.838 --> 00:05:20.410
Individuals with material that could
help us were drawn toward us

00:05:20.434 --> 00:05:22.473
by some kind of gravitational force.

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:28.297
And after six days, we had managed
to track down around 20 witnesses.

00:05:29.463 --> 00:05:31.173
We've plotted them here on the map.

00:05:31.197 --> 00:05:33.256
This is the scene
of Ian Tomlinson's death,

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:34.985
the Bank of England in London.

00:05:35.009 --> 00:05:37.627
And each of these witnesses
that we plotted on the map,

00:05:37.651 --> 00:05:40.316
you could click on these
small bullet points,

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:42.618
and you could hear what they had to say,

00:05:42.642 --> 00:05:44.438
see their photographic image

00:05:44.462 --> 00:05:47.181
and at times,
see their videographic images as well.

00:05:47.716 --> 00:05:49.805
But still, at this stage,

00:05:49.829 --> 00:05:53.735
with witnesses telling us that they'd seen
police attack Ian Tomlinson

00:05:53.759 --> 00:05:54.910
before his death,

00:05:54.934 --> 00:05:57.793
still, police refused to accept that.

00:05:58.452 --> 00:06:00.970
There was no official
investigation into his death.

00:06:02.025 --> 00:06:03.656
And then something changed.

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:07.587
I got an email from an investment fund
manager in New York.

00:06:08.183 --> 00:06:11.788
On the day of Ian Tomlinson's death,
he'd been in London on business,

00:06:11.812 --> 00:06:14.350
and he'd taken out his digital camera,

00:06:15.112 --> 00:06:16.939
and he'd recorded this.

00:06:22.471 --> 00:06:24.862
(Video) Narrator:
This is the crowd at G20 protest

00:06:24.886 --> 00:06:27.173
on April the 1st, around 7:20pm.

00:06:27.858 --> 00:06:30.186
They were on Cornhill,
near the Bank of England.

00:06:30.210 --> 00:06:33.016
This footage will form the basis
of a police investigation

00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:34.700
into the death of this man.

00:06:35.115 --> 00:06:37.378
Ian Tomlinson was walking
through this area,

00:06:37.402 --> 00:06:39.092
attempting to get home from work.

00:06:39.583 --> 00:06:41.913
(People yelling)

00:06:54.540 --> 00:06:57.966
We've slowed down the footage
to show how it poses serious questions

00:06:57.990 --> 00:06:59.567
about police conduct.

00:06:59.591 --> 00:07:02.876
Ian Tomlinson had his back
to riot officers and dog handlers

00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:04.619
and was walking away from them.

00:07:04.643 --> 00:07:06.592
He had his hands in his pockets.

00:07:06.616 --> 00:07:10.395
Here the riot officer appears to strike
Tomlinson's leg area with a baton.

00:07:10.927 --> 00:07:13.258
He then lunges at Tomlinson from behind.

00:07:14.950 --> 00:07:17.702
Tomlinson is propelled forward
and hits the floor.

00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:25.492
(People yelling)

00:07:32.818 --> 00:07:34.496
Paul Lewis: OK. So, shocking stuff.

00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:36.237
That video wasn't playing too well,

00:07:36.261 --> 00:07:39.007
but I remember when I first watched
the video for myself,

00:07:39.031 --> 00:07:42.206
I'd been in touch with
this investment fund manager in New York,

00:07:42.230 --> 00:07:44.426
and I had become obsessed with this story.

00:07:44.450 --> 00:07:48.323
I had spoken to so many people
who said they had seen this happen,

00:07:48.347 --> 00:07:50.894
and the guy on the other end
of the phone was saying,

00:07:50.918 --> 00:07:52.283
"Look, the video shows it."

00:07:52.307 --> 00:07:54.927
I didn't want to believe him
until I saw it for myself.

00:07:54.951 --> 00:07:58.006
It was two o'clock in the morning,
I was there with an IT guy --

00:07:58.030 --> 00:07:59.256
the video wasn't coming.

00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:01.222
Finally, it landed, and I clicked on it.

00:08:01.246 --> 00:08:04.133
And I realized: this is really
something quite significant.

00:08:04.157 --> 00:08:06.727
Within 15 hours, we put it on our website.

00:08:06.751 --> 00:08:09.456
The first thing police did
was they came to our office --

00:08:09.480 --> 00:08:11.269
senior officers came to our office --

00:08:11.293 --> 00:08:13.026
and asked us to take the video down.

00:08:13.050 --> 00:08:14.209
We said no.

00:08:14.233 --> 00:08:15.983
It would have been too late, anyway,

00:08:16.007 --> 00:08:17.993
because it had traveled around the world.

00:08:18.017 --> 00:08:20.536
And the officer in that film,
in two days' time,

00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:22.846
will appear before
an inquest jury in London,

00:08:22.870 --> 00:08:26.788
and they have the power to decide
that Ian Tomlinson was unlawfully killed.

00:08:26.812 --> 00:08:29.326
So that's the first case;
I said two cases today.

00:08:29.350 --> 00:08:30.896
The second case is this man.

00:08:30.920 --> 00:08:35.084
Now, like Ian Tomlinson,
he was a father, he lived in London.

00:08:35.108 --> 00:08:38.615
But he was a political
refugee from Angola.

00:08:38.639 --> 00:08:41.104
And six months ago,
the British government decided

00:08:41.128 --> 00:08:43.545
they wanted to return him to Angola;

00:08:43.569 --> 00:08:45.446
he was a failed asylum seeker.

00:08:45.470 --> 00:08:49.496
So they booked him a seat on an airline,
a flight from Heathrow.

00:08:50.500 --> 00:08:53.746
Now, the official version of events,
the official explanation,

00:08:53.770 --> 00:08:55.336
of Jimmy Mubenga's death

00:08:55.360 --> 00:08:57.486
was simply that he'd taken ill.

00:08:57.510 --> 00:09:00.749
He'd become unwell on the flight,
the plane had returned to Heathrow,

00:09:00.773 --> 00:09:03.686
and then he was transferred to hospital
and pronounced dead.

00:09:03.710 --> 00:09:06.166
Now, what actually happened
to Jimmy Mubenga,

00:09:06.190 --> 00:09:09.370
the story we were able to tell,
my colleague Mathew Taylor and I,

00:09:09.394 --> 00:09:12.737
was that, actually, three security guards
began trying to restrain him

00:09:12.761 --> 00:09:13.912
in his seat;

00:09:13.936 --> 00:09:17.452
when was resisting his deportation,
they were restraining him in his seat.

00:09:17.476 --> 00:09:19.899
They placed him in a dangerous hold.

00:09:20.910 --> 00:09:24.356
It keeps detainees quiet,
and he was making a lot of noise.

00:09:24.380 --> 00:09:26.626
But it can also lead
to positional asphyxia,

00:09:26.650 --> 00:09:27.882
a form of suffocation.

00:09:28.310 --> 00:09:31.374
So you have to imagine:
there were other passengers on the plane,

00:09:31.398 --> 00:09:32.903
and they could hear him saying,

00:09:32.927 --> 00:09:35.514
"I can't breathe! I can't breathe!
They're killing me!"

00:09:35.538 --> 00:09:37.045
And then he stopped breathing.

00:09:37.069 --> 00:09:38.832
So how did we find these passengers?

00:09:38.856 --> 00:09:41.956
In the case of Ian Tomlinson,
the witnesses were still in London.

00:09:41.980 --> 00:09:44.772
But these passengers,
many of them, had returned to Angola.

00:09:44.796 --> 00:09:46.316
How were we going to find them?

00:09:46.340 --> 00:09:47.939
Again, we turned to the internet.

00:09:47.963 --> 00:09:51.278
We wrote, as I said before,
stories -- they're online magnets.

00:09:51.302 --> 00:09:54.780
The tone of some these stories,
journalism professors might frown upon

00:09:54.804 --> 00:09:56.232
because they were skeptical;

00:09:56.256 --> 00:09:58.596
they were asking questions,
perhaps speculative,

00:09:58.620 --> 00:10:00.984
maybe the kind of things
journalists shouldn't do.

00:10:01.008 --> 00:10:03.996
But we needed to do it,
and we needed to use Twitter also.

00:10:04.020 --> 00:10:06.281
Here I'm saying an Angolan man
dies on a flight.

00:10:06.305 --> 00:10:08.656
This story could be big;
a level of speculation.

00:10:08.680 --> 00:10:11.176
This next tweet says, "Please RT."

00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:14.558
That means "please retweet,"
please pass down the chain.

00:10:15.375 --> 00:10:18.227
And one of the fascinating
things about Twitter

00:10:18.251 --> 00:10:20.410
is that the pattern of flow of information

00:10:20.434 --> 00:10:22.766
is unlike anything we've ever seen before.

00:10:22.790 --> 00:10:24.256
We don't really understand it,

00:10:24.280 --> 00:10:26.502
but once you let go
of a piece of information,

00:10:26.526 --> 00:10:27.890
it travels like wind.

00:10:28.350 --> 00:10:30.345
You can't determine where it ends up.

00:10:30.889 --> 00:10:32.571
But strangely,

00:10:32.595 --> 00:10:36.422
tweets have an uncanny ability
to reach their intended destination.

00:10:36.446 --> 00:10:38.697
And in this case, it was this man.

00:10:39.591 --> 00:10:43.606
He says, "I was also there on the BA77" --
that's the flight number --

00:10:43.630 --> 00:10:45.566
"And the man was begging for help,

00:10:45.590 --> 00:10:48.120
and I now feel so guilty
that I did nothing."

00:10:48.144 --> 00:10:49.748
This was Michael.

00:10:49.772 --> 00:10:54.181
He was on an Angolan oil field
when he sent me this tweet.

00:10:54.205 --> 00:10:55.691
I was in my office in London.

00:10:56.126 --> 00:10:58.896
He had concerns about
what happened on the flight.

00:10:59.526 --> 00:11:02.472
He'd gone onto his laptop,
he typed in the flight number.

00:11:02.496 --> 00:11:05.866
He had encountered that tweet,
he had encountered our stories.

00:11:05.890 --> 00:11:11.162
He realized we had an intention
to tell a different version of events;

00:11:11.186 --> 00:11:12.377
we were skeptical.

00:11:12.787 --> 00:11:14.082
And he contacted me.

00:11:14.905 --> 00:11:16.727
And this is what Michael said.

00:11:16.751 --> 00:11:20.466
(Audio) Michael: I'm pretty sure
it'll turn out to be asphyxiation.

00:11:20.490 --> 00:11:24.314
The last thing we heard the man saying
was he couldn't breathe.

00:11:24.338 --> 00:11:28.455
And you've got three security guards,

00:11:28.479 --> 00:11:32.452
each one of them looked
like 100-kilo plus,

00:11:32.476 --> 00:11:35.635
bearing down on him, holding him
down -- from what I could see,

00:11:35.659 --> 00:11:36.936
below the seats.

00:11:36.960 --> 00:11:42.118
What I saw was the three men trying
to pull him down below the seats.

00:11:42.142 --> 00:11:45.166
And all I could see was his head
sticking up above the seats,

00:11:45.190 --> 00:11:48.998
and he was hollering out,
you know, "Help me!"

00:11:49.022 --> 00:11:52.043
He just kept saying, "Help me! Help me!"

00:11:52.067 --> 00:11:55.741
And then he disappeared below the seats.

00:11:55.765 --> 00:12:00.297
And you could see the three security
guards sitting on top of him from there.

00:12:01.391 --> 00:12:03.227
For the rest of my life,

00:12:03.251 --> 00:12:06.616
I'm always going to have that
in the back of my mind.

00:12:06.640 --> 00:12:08.315
Could I have done something?

00:12:08.339 --> 00:12:11.949
That's going to bother me
every time I lay down to go to sleep now.

00:12:11.973 --> 00:12:13.723
Wow; I didn't get involved

00:12:13.747 --> 00:12:18.050
because I was scared I might get
kicked off the flight and lose my job.

00:12:18.074 --> 00:12:21.716
If it takes three men to hold a man down,

00:12:21.740 --> 00:12:24.434
to put him on a flight,

00:12:24.458 --> 00:12:26.914
one the public is on,

00:12:26.938 --> 00:12:28.478
that's excessive.

00:12:28.502 --> 00:12:30.062
OK?

00:12:30.086 --> 00:12:33.326
If the man died,

00:12:33.350 --> 00:12:35.945
that right there is excessive.

00:12:37.730 --> 00:12:41.117
PL: So that was his interpretation
of what had happened on the flight.

00:12:41.141 --> 00:12:43.606
And Michael was actually
one of five witnesses

00:12:43.630 --> 00:12:47.367
that we eventually managed to track down,
most of them, as I said,

00:12:47.391 --> 00:12:50.815
through the internet,
through social media.

00:12:50.839 --> 00:12:52.898
We could actually place them on the plane,

00:12:52.922 --> 00:12:55.201
so you could see
exactly where they were sat.

00:12:55.225 --> 00:12:56.684
And I should say at this stage

00:12:56.708 --> 00:12:59.102
that one really important
dimension to all of this

00:12:59.126 --> 00:13:01.526
for journalists who utilize social media

00:13:01.550 --> 00:13:03.579
and who utilize citizen journalism

00:13:03.603 --> 00:13:05.996
is making sure we get our facts correct.

00:13:06.020 --> 00:13:08.623
Verification is absolutely essential.

00:13:08.647 --> 00:13:11.462
So in the case
of the Ian Tomlinson witnesses,

00:13:11.486 --> 00:13:13.936
I got them to return
to the scene of the death

00:13:13.960 --> 00:13:16.112
and physically walk me through

00:13:16.136 --> 00:13:18.158
and tell me exactly what they had seen.

00:13:18.819 --> 00:13:20.509
That was absolutely essential.

00:13:20.533 --> 00:13:22.600
In the case of Mubenga,
we couldn't do that,

00:13:22.624 --> 00:13:24.740
but they could send us
their boarding passes.

00:13:24.764 --> 00:13:26.980
And we could interrogate
what they were saying

00:13:27.004 --> 00:13:30.474
and ensure it was consistent with what
other passengers were saying, too.

00:13:30.498 --> 00:13:33.692
The danger in all of this
for journalists -- for all of us --

00:13:33.716 --> 00:13:35.881
is that we're victims of hoaxes,

00:13:35.905 --> 00:13:40.413
or that there's deliberate misinformation
fed into the public domain.

00:13:40.437 --> 00:13:42.196
So we have to be careful.

00:13:42.220 --> 00:13:45.915
But nobody can deny
the power of citizen journalism.

00:13:45.939 --> 00:13:49.207
When a plane crashes
into the Hudson two years ago,

00:13:49.231 --> 00:13:53.014
and the world finds out about this
because a man is on a nearby ferry,

00:13:53.038 --> 00:13:56.476
and he takes out his iPhone
and photographs the image of the plane

00:13:56.500 --> 00:13:58.036
and sends it around the world --

00:13:58.060 --> 00:14:00.233
that's how most people
found out initially,

00:14:00.257 --> 00:14:03.916
in the early minutes and hours,
about the plane in the Hudson River.

00:14:04.724 --> 00:14:07.893
Now, think of the two biggest
news stories of the year.

00:14:07.917 --> 00:14:10.689
We had the Japanese earthquake
and the tsunami.

00:14:11.534 --> 00:14:14.856
Cast your mind's eye
back to the images that you saw

00:14:14.880 --> 00:14:16.727
on your television screens.

00:14:16.751 --> 00:14:20.426
They were boats left five miles inland.

00:14:20.450 --> 00:14:22.531
They were houses being moved along,

00:14:23.239 --> 00:14:24.577
as if in the sea.

00:14:25.510 --> 00:14:29.854
Water lifting up inside people's
living rooms, supermarkets shaking --

00:14:29.878 --> 00:14:32.226
these were images
shot by citizen journalists

00:14:32.250 --> 00:14:34.106
and instantly shared on the internet.

00:14:34.130 --> 00:14:38.573
And the other big story of the year:
the political crisis,

00:14:38.597 --> 00:14:41.146
the political earthquake
in the Middle East.

00:14:41.684 --> 00:14:46.086
And it doesn't matter if it was
Egypt or Libya or Syria or Yemen.

00:14:46.642 --> 00:14:51.458
Individuals have managed to overcome
the repressive restrictions

00:14:51.482 --> 00:14:52.633
in those regimes

00:14:53.260 --> 00:14:55.416
by recording their environment

00:14:55.440 --> 00:14:57.666
and telling their own stories
on the internet.

00:14:57.690 --> 00:14:59.734
Again, always very difficult to verify,

00:14:59.758 --> 00:15:03.340
but potentially,
a huge layer of accountability.

00:15:03.823 --> 00:15:06.426
This image -- and I could have
shown you any, actually;

00:15:06.450 --> 00:15:07.716
YouTube is full of them --

00:15:07.740 --> 00:15:11.763
This image is of an apparently
unarmed protester in Bahrain.

00:15:12.347 --> 00:15:14.532
And he's being shot by security forces.

00:15:15.285 --> 00:15:19.666
It doesn't matter
if the individual being mistreated,

00:15:19.690 --> 00:15:21.099
possibly even killed,

00:15:21.837 --> 00:15:23.363
is in Bahrain or in London.

00:15:23.803 --> 00:15:27.227
But citizen journalism and this
technology has inserted

00:15:27.251 --> 00:15:30.536
a new layer of accountability
into our world,

00:15:30.560 --> 00:15:32.321
and I think that's a good thing.

00:15:32.345 --> 00:15:35.734
So to conclude: the theme
of the conference, "Why not?" --

00:15:36.663 --> 00:15:39.067
I think for journalists,
it's quite simple, really.

00:15:39.091 --> 00:15:41.411
I mean, why not utilize this technology,

00:15:41.435 --> 00:15:45.120
which massively broadens
the boundaries of what's possible,

00:15:45.144 --> 00:15:48.736
accept that many of the things
that happen in our world now go recorded,

00:15:48.760 --> 00:15:51.082
and we can obtain that information

00:15:51.106 --> 00:15:52.377
through social media?

00:15:52.834 --> 00:15:54.208
That's new for journalists.

00:15:54.232 --> 00:15:58.006
The stories I showed you, I don't think
we would have been able to investigate

00:15:58.030 --> 00:16:01.006
10 years ago, possibly even
five years ago.

00:16:01.030 --> 00:16:04.086
I think there's a very good argument
to say that the two deaths,

00:16:04.110 --> 00:16:06.946
the death of Ian Tomlinson
and the death of Jimmy Mubenga,

00:16:06.970 --> 00:16:10.506
we still today wouldn't know
exactly what had happened in those cases.

00:16:10.530 --> 00:16:12.916
And "Why not?" for people like yourselves?

00:16:12.940 --> 00:16:15.535
Well, I think that's very simple, too.

00:16:15.559 --> 00:16:19.196
If you encounter something
that you believe is problematic,

00:16:19.220 --> 00:16:23.281
that disturbs you, that concerns you,
an injustice of some kind,

00:16:23.305 --> 00:16:26.326
something that just
doesn't feel quite right,

00:16:26.350 --> 00:16:31.022
then why not witness it,
record it and share it?

00:16:31.993 --> 00:16:37.317
That process of witnessing,
recording and sharing is journalism.

00:16:37.829 --> 00:16:40.106
And we can all do it. Thank you.
