00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
When I was little --

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
and by the way, I was little once --

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
my father told me a story

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
about an 18th century watchmaker.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
And what this guy had done:

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
he used to produce these fabulously beautiful watches.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
And one day, one of his customers came into his workshop

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
and asked him to clean the watch that he'd bought.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
And the guy took it apart,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
and one of the things he pulled out was one of the balance wheels.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
And as he did so, his customer noticed

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
that on the back side of the balance wheel was an engraving,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
were words.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
And he said to the guy,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
"Why have you put stuff on the back

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
that no one will ever see?"

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
And the watchmaker turned around and said,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
"God can see it."

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
Now I'm not in the least bit religious,

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
neither was my father,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
but at that point, I noticed something happening here.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
I felt something

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000
in this plexus of blood vessels and nerves,

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
and there must be some muscles in there as well somewhere, I guess.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
But I felt something.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
And it was a physiological response.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
And from that point on, from my age at the time,

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
I began to think of things in a different way.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
And as I took on my career as a designer,

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
I began to ask myself the simple question:

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
Do we actually think beauty,

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
or do we feel it?

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
Now you probably know the answer to this already.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
You probably think, well, I don't know which one you think it is,

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
but I think it's about feeling beauty.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.000
And so I then moved on into my design career

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
and began to find some exciting things.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
One of the most early work was done in automotive design --

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
some very exciting work was done there.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
And during a lot of this work,

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
we found something, or I found something,

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
that really fascinated me, and maybe you can remember it.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
Do you remember when lights used to just go on and off,

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
click click, when you closed the door in a car?

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
And then somebody, I think it was BMW,

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
introduced a light that went out slowly.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
Remember that?

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
I remember it clearly.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
Do you remember the first time you were in a car and it did that?

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
I remember sitting there thinking, this is fantastic.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
In fact, I've never found anybody

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
that doesn't like the light that goes out slowly.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
I thought, well what the hell's that about?

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
So I started to ask myself questions about it.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
And the first was, I'd ask other people: "Do you like it?" "Yes."

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
"Why?" And they'd say, "Oh, it feels so natural,"

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
or, "It's nice."

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
I thought, well that's not good enough.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
Can we cut down a little bit further,

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000
because, as a designer, I need the vocabulary, I need the keyboard,

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
of how this actually works.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
And so I did some experiments.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
And I suddenly realized

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
that there was something that did exactly that --

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
light to dark in six seconds --

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
exactly that.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000
Do you know what it is? Anyone?

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000
You see, using this bit, the thinky bit,

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
the slow bit of the brain -- using that.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
And this isn't a think, it's a feel.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
And would you do me a favor?

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
For the next 14 minutes or whatever it is,

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
will you feel stuff?

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000
I don't need you to think so much as I want you to feel it.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000
I felt a sense of relaxation

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000
tempered with anticipation.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000
And that thing that I found

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
was the cinema or the theater.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
It's actually just happened here --

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
light to dark in six seconds.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
And when that happens, are you sitting there going,

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000
"No, the movie's about to start,"

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000
or are you going, "That's fantastic. I'm looking forward to it.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000
I get a sense of anticipation"?

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
Now I'm not a neuroscientist.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000
I don't know even if there is something called a conditioned reflex.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000
But it might be.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
Because the people I speak to in the northern hemisphere

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000
that used to go in the cinema get this.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
And some of the people I speak to

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000
that have never seen a movie or been to the theater

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000
don't get it in the same way.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000
Everybody likes it,

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.000
but some like it more than others.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000
So this leads me to think of this in a different way.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000
We're not feeling it. We're thinking beauty is in the limbic system --

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000
if that's not an outmoded idea.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.000
These are the bits, the pleasure centers,

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.000
and maybe what I'm seeing and sensing and feeling

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000
is bypassing my thinking.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.000
The wiring from your sensory apparatus to those bits

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000
is shorter than the bits that have to pass through the thinky bit, the cortex.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000
They arrive first.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000
So how do we make that actually work?

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000
And how much of that reactive side of it

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000
is due to what we already know,

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000
or what we're going to learn, about something?

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000
This is one of the most beautiful things I know.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000
It's a plastic bag.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.000
And when I looked at it first, I thought, no, there's no beauty in that.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000
Then I found out,

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000
post exposure,

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.000
that this plastic bag if I put it into a filthy puddle

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
or a stream filled with coliforms

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
and all sorts of disgusting stuff,

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
that that filthy water

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.000
will migrate through the wall of the bag by osmosis

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:39.000
and end up inside it as pure, potable drinking water.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000
And all of a sudden, this plastic bag

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.000
was extremely beautiful to me.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000
Now I'm going to ask you again

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000
to switch on the emotional bit.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000
Would you mind taking the brain out,

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000
and I just want you to feel something.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.000
Look at that. What are you feeling about it?

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.000
Is it beautiful? Is it exciting?

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.000
I'm watching your faces very carefully.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000
There's some rather bored-looking gentlemen

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000
and some slightly engaged-looking ladies

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000
who are picking up something off that.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000
Maybe there's an innocence to it.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.000
Now I'm going to tell you what it is. Are you ready?

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.000
This is the last act on this Earth

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.000
of a little girl called Heidi, five years old,

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.000
before she died of cancer to the spine.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000
It's the last thing she did,

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000
the last physical act.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000
Look at that picture.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.000
Look at the innocence. Look at the beauty in it.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.000
Is it beautiful now?

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.000
Stop. Stop. How do you feel?

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000
Where are you feeling this?

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.000
I'm feeling it here. I feel it here.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000
And I'm watching your faces,

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.000
because your faces are telling me something.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.000
The lady over there is actually crying, by the way.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.000
But what are you doing?

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000
I watch what people do.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000
I watch faces.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.000
I watch reactions.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.000
Because I have to know how people react to things.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000
And one of the most common faces

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000
on something faced with beauty,

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.000
something stupefyingly delicious,

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.000
is what I call the OMG.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.000
And by the way, there's no pleasure in that face.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.000
It's not a "this is wonderful!"

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.000
The eyebrows are doing this, the eyes are defocused,

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.000
and the mouth is hanging open.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.000
That's not the expression of joy.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000
There's something else in that.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000
There's something weird happening.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.000
So pleasure seems to be tempered

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000
by a whole series of different things coming in.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.000
Poignancy is a word I love as a designer.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.000
It means something triggering a big emotional response,

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:37.000
often quite a sad emotional response,

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000
but it's part of what we do.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.000
It isn't just about nice.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.000
And this is the dilemma, this is the paradox, of beauty.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.000
Sensorily, we're taking in all sorts of things --

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:49.000
mixtures of things that are good, bad, exciting, frightening --

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000
to come up with that sensorial exposure,

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000
that sensation of what's going on.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000
Pathos appears obviously

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.000
as part of what you just saw in that little girl's drawing.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:01.000
And also triumph, this sense of transcendence,

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:04.000
this "I never knew that. Ah, this is something new."

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.000
And that's packed in there as well.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.000
And as we assemble these tools,

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:11.000
from a design point of view, I get terribly excited about it,

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.000
because these are things, as we've already said,

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000
they're arriving at the brain, it would seem,

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.000
before cognition, before we can manipulate them --

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.000
electrochemical party tricks.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.000
Now what I'm also interested in is:

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.000
Is it possible to separate

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.000
intrinsic and extrinsic beauty?

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:31.000
By that, I mean intrinsically beautiful things,

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.000
just something that's exquisitely beautiful,

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.000
that's universally beautiful.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.000
Very hard to find. Maybe you've got some examples of it.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.000
Very hard to find something that, to everybody,

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.000
is a very beautiful thing,

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:46.000
without a certain amount of information packed in there before.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.000
So a lot of it tends to be extrinsic.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:52.000
It's mediated by information before the comprehension.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000
Or the information's added on at the back,

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.000
like that little girl's drawing that I showed you.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.000
Now when talking about beauty

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.000
you can't get away from the fact

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:04.000
that a lot experiments have been done in this way

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.000
with faces and what have you.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.000
And one of the most tedious ones, I think,

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.000
was saying that beauty was about symmetry.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000
Well it obviously isn't.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.000
This is a more interesting one

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.000
where half faces were shown to some people,

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.000
and then to add them into a list

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.000
of most beautiful to least beautiful

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.000
and then exposing a full face.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.000
And they found that it was almost exact coincidence.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.000
So it wasn't about symmetry.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:30.000
In fact, this lady has a particularly asymmetrical face,

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.000
of which both sides are beautiful.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.000
But they're both different.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.000
And as a designer, I can't help meddling with this,

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:40.000
so I pulled it to bits and sort of did stuff like this,

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000
and tried to understand what the individual elements were,

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.000
but feeling it as I go.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:47.000
Now I can feel a sensation of delight and beauty

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.000
if I look at that eye.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000
I'm not getting it off the eyebrow.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.000
And the earhole isn't doing it to me at all.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.000
So I don't know how much this is helping me,

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.000
but it's helping to guide me to the places

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.000
where the signals are coming off.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:02.000
And as I say, I'm not a neuroscientist,

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000
but to understand how I can start to assemble things

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:07.000
that will very quickly bypass

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.000
this thinking part

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.000
and get me to the enjoyable precognitive elements.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:16.000
Anais Nin and the Talmud have told us time and time again

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:19.000
that we see things not as they are, but as we are.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.000
So I'm going to shamelessly expose something to you,

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.000
which is beautiful to me.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:28.000
And this is the F1 MV Agusta.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.000
Ahhhh.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.000
It is really -- I mean, I can't express to you

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.000
how exquisite this object is.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:37.000
But I also know why it's exquisite to me,

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:40.000
because it's a palimpsest of things.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.000
It's masses and masses of layers.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.000
This is just the bit that protrudes into our physical dimension.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.000
It's something much bigger.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:50.000
Layer after layer of legend, sport, details that resonate.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:53.000
I mean, if I just go through some of them now --

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:56.000
I know about laminar flow when it comes to air-piercing objects,

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:59.000
and that does it consummately well, you can see it can.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.000
So that's getting me excited.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.000
And I feel that here.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.000
This bit, the big secret of automotive design --

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.000
reflection management.

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.000
It's not about the shapes,

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.000
it's how the shapes reflect light.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:14.000
Now that thing, light flickers across it as you move,

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.000
so it becomes a kinetic object,

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.000
even though it's standing still --

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:21.000
managed by how brilliantly that's done on the reflection.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:24.000
This little relief on the footplate, by the way, to a rider

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.000
means there's something going on underneath it --

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:29.000
in this case, a drive chain running at 300 miles and hour probably,

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.000
taking the power from the engine.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:33.000
I'm getting terribly excited

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:36.000
as my mind and my eyes flick across these things.

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:39.000
Titanium lacquer on this.

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:42.000
I can't tell you how wonderful this is.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:45.000
That's how you stop the nuts coming off at high speed on the wheel.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.000
I'm really getting into this now.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:50.000
And of course, a racing bike doesn't have a prop stand,

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.000
but this one, because it's a road bike,

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:55.000
it all goes away and it folds into this little gap.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.000
So it disappears.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.000
And then I can't tell you how hard it is to do that radiator, which is curved.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.000
Why would you do that?

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:04.000
Because I know we need to bring the wheel farther into the aerodynamics.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:06.000
So it's more expensive, but it's wonderful.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.000
And to cap it all,

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.000
brand royalty --

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.000
Agusta, Count Agusta,

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.000
from the great histories of this stuff.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:17.000
The bit that you can't see is the genius that created this.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.000
Massimo Tamburini.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.000
They call him "The Plumber" in Italy,

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.000
as well as "Maestro,"

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:26.000
because he actually is engineer

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:29.000
and craftsman and sculptor at the same time.

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:32.000
There's so little compromise on this, you can't see it.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:35.000
But unfortunately, the likes of me and people that are like me

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:38.000
have to deal with compromise all the time with beauty.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.000
We have to deal with it.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:43.000
So I have to work with a supply chain, and I've got to work with the technologies,

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.000
and I've got to work with everything else all the time,

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:48.000
and so compromises start to fit into it.

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.000
And so look at her.

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.000
I've had to make a bit of a compromise there.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.000
I've had to move that part across, but only a millimeter.

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.000
No one's noticed, have they yet?

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.000
Did you see what I did?

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.000
I moved three things by a millimeter.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.000
Pretty? Yes.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.000
Beautiful? Maybe lesser.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:08.000
But then, of course, the consumer says that doesn't really matter.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.000
So that's okay, isn't it?

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.000
Another millimeter?

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.000
No one's going to notice those split lines and changes.

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.000
It's that easy to lose beauty,

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:20.000
because beauty's incredibly difficult to do.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.000
And only a few people can do it.

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:25.000
And a focus group cannot do it.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.000
And a team rarely can do it.

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:30.000
It takes a central cortex, if you like,

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:33.000
to be able to orchestrate all those elements at the same time.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:35.000
This is a beautiful water bottle --

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:37.000
some of you know of it --

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.000
done by Ross Lovegrove, the designer.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:41.000
This is pretty close to intrinsic beauty. This one,

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.000
as long as you know what water is like

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:45.000
then you can experience this.

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:47.000
It's lovely because it is an embodiment

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:49.000
of something refreshing and delicious.

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:51.000
I might like it more than you like it,

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:54.000
because I know how bloody hard it is to do it.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.000
It's stupefyingly difficult

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:59.000
to make something that refracts light like that,

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.000
that comes out of the tool correctly,

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:03.000
that goes down the line without falling over.

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:06.000
Underneath this, like the story of the swan,

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:09.000
is a million things very difficult to do.

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:11.000
So all hail to that.

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:14.000
It's a fantastic example, a simple object.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:17.000
And the one I showed you before was, of course, a massively complex one.

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:19.000
And they're working in beauty

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:22.000
in slightly different ways because of it.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.000
You all, I guess, like me,

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.000
enjoy watching a ballet dancer dance.

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:29.000
And part of the joy of it is, you know the difficulty.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:32.000
You also may be taking into account the fact that it's incredibly painful.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.000
Anybody seen a ballet dancer's toes

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:36.000
when they come out of the points?

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:39.000
While she's doing these graceful arabesques and plies and what have you,

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:42.000
something horrible's going on down here.

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.000
The comprehension of it

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:46.000
leads us to a greater and heightened sense

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.000
of the beauty of what's actually going on.

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.000
Now I'm using microseconds wrongly here,

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.000
so please ignore me.

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:54.000
But what I have to do now, feeling again,

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:57.000
what I've got to do is to be able to supply enough of these enzymes,

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:00.000
of these triggers into something early on in the process,

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.000
that you pick it up,

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.000
not through your thinking, but through your feeling.

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:06.000
So we're going to have a little experiment.

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:09.000
Right, are you ready? I'm going to show you something for a very, very brief moment.

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:12.000
Are you ready? Okay.

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:14.000
Did you think that was a bicycle when I showed it to you at the first flash?

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.000
It's not.

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:20.000
Tell me something, did you think it was quick when you first saw it? Yes you did.

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:22.000
Did you think it was modern? Yes you did.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:25.000
That blip, that information, shot into you before that.

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:28.000
And because your brain starter motor began there,

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.000
now it's got to deal with it.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.000
And the great thing is, this motorcycle has been styled this way

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.000
specifically to engender a sense

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:37.000
that it's green technology and it's good for you

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:40.000
and it's light and it's all part of the future.

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.000
So is that wrong?

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:44.000
Well in this case it isn't,

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:47.000
because it's a very, very ecologically-sound piece of technology.

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:49.000
But you're a slave of that first flash.

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:53.000
We are slaves to the first few fractions of a second --

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:55.000
and that's where much of my work

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:57.000
has to win or lose,

00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:59.000
on a shelf in a shop.

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:01.000
It wins or loses at that point.

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:04.000
You may see 50, 100, 200 things on a shelf

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:06.000
as you walk down it,

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:08.000
but I have to work within that domain,

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:11.000
to ensure that it gets you there first.

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:14.000
And finally, the layer that I love, of knowledge.

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:16.000
Some of you, I'm sure, will be familiar with this.

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:18.000
What's incredible about this,

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.000
and the way I love to come back to it,

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:23.000
is this is taking something that you hate or bores you,

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:25.000
folding clothes,

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:27.000
and if you can actually do this --

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:29.000
who can actually do this? Anybody try to do this?

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:31.000
Yeah?

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:33.000
It's fantastic, isn't it?

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:35.000
Look at that. Do you want to see it again?

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:38.000
No time. It says I have two minutes left, so we can't do this.

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:40.000
But just go to the Web, YouTube,

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:42.000
pull it down, "folding T-shirt."

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:45.000
That's how underpaid younger-aged people have to fold your T-shirt.

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:47.000
You didn't maybe know it.

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:49.000
But how do you feel about it?

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:51.000
It feels fantastic when you do it, you look forward to doing it,

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:54.000
and when you tell somebody else about it -- like you probably have --

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:56.000
you look really smart.

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:58.000
The knowledge bubble that sits around the outside,

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:00.000
the stuff that costs nothing,

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:02.000
because that knowledge is free --

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:04.000
bundle that together and where do we come out?

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:07.000
Form follows function?

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:10.000
Only sometimes. Only sometimes.

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:13.000
Form is function. Form is function.

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:15.000
It informs, it tells us,

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:18.000
it supplies us answers before we've even thought about it.

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:20.000
And so I've stopped using words like "form,"

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:22.000
and I've stopped using words like "function" as a designer.

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:24.000
What I try to pursue now

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:26.000
is the emotional functionality of things.

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:29.000
Because if I can get that right,

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:32.000
I can make them wonderful, and I can make them repeatedly wonderful.

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:34.000
And you know what those products and services are,

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:36.000
because you own some of them.

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:39.000
They're the things that you'd snatch if the house was on fire.

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:41.000
Forming the emotional bond

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:43.000
between this thing and you

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:45.000
is an electrochemical party trick

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:48.000
that happens before you even think about it.

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:50.000
Thank you very much.

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:54.000
(Applause)
