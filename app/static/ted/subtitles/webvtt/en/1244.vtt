WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Well we all know the World Wide Web

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.000
has absolutely transformed publishing, broadcasting,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
commerce and social connectivity,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
but where did it all come from?

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
And I'll quote three people:

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Vannevar Bush, Doug Engelbart and Tim Berners-Lee.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
So let's just run through these guys.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
This is Vannevar Bush.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Vannevar Bush was the U.S. government's chief scientific adviser during the war.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
And in 1945,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
he published an article in a magazine called Atlantic Monthly.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
And the article was called "As We May Think."

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
And what Vannevar Bush was saying

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
was the way we use information is broken.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
We don't work in terms of libraries

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
and catalog systems and so forth.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
The brain works by association.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
With one item in its thought, it snaps instantly to the next item.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
And the way information is structured

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
is totally incapable of keeping up with this process.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
And so he suggested a machine,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
and he called it the memex.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
And the memex would link information,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
one piece of information to a related piece of information and so forth.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
Now this was in 1945.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
A computer in those days

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
was something the secret services used to use for code breaking.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
And nobody knew anything about it.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
So this was before the computer was invented.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
And he proposed this machine called the memex.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
And he had a platform where you linked information to other information,

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
and then you could call it up at will.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
So spinning forward,

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
one of the guys who read this article was a guy called Doug Engelbart,

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
and he was a U.S. Air Force officer.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
And he was reading it in their library in the Far East.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
And he was so inspired by this article,

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
it kind of directed the rest of his life.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
And by the mid-60s, he was able to put this into action

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
when he worked at the Stanford Research Lab in California.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
He built a system.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
The system was designed to augment human intelligence, it was called.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
And in a premonition of today's world

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
of cloud computing and softwares of service,

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
his system was called NLS

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
for oN-Line System.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
And this is Doug Engelbart.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
He was giving a presentation at the Fall Joint Computer Conference

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000
in 1968.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
What he showed --

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
he sat on a stage like this, and he demonstrated this system.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
He had his head mic like I've got.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
And he works this system.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
And you can see, he's working between documents

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
and graphics and so forth.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
And he's driving it all

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
with this platform here,

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
with a five-finger keyboard

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
and the world's first computer mouse,

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
which he specially designed in order to do this system.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
So this is where the mouse came from as well.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
So this is Doug Engelbart.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
The trouble with Doug Engelbart's system

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000
was that the computers in those days cost several million pounds.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
So for a personal computer,

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
a few million pounds was like having a personal jet plane;

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
it wasn't really very practical.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
But spin on to the 80s

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
when personal computers did arrive,

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
then there was room for this kind of system on personal computers.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
And my company, OWL

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000
built a system called Guide for the Apple Macintosh.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.000
And we delivered the world's first hypertext system.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
And this began to get a head of steam.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
Apple introduced a thing called HyperCard,

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
and they made a bit of a fuss about it.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000
They had a 12-page supplement in the Wall Street Journal the day it launched.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000
The magazines started to cover it.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000
Byte magazine and Communications at the ACM

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000
had special issues covering hypertext.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
We developed a PC version of this product

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
as well as the Macintosh version.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000
And our PC version became quite mature.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000
These are some examples of this system in action in the late 80s.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000
You were able to deliver documents, were able to do it over networks.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000
We developed a system such

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000
that it had a markup language based on html.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.000
We called it hml: hypertext markup language.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
And the system was capable of doing

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.000
very, very large documentation systems over computer networks.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.000
So I took this system to a trade show in Versailles near Paris

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.000
in late November 1990.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000
And I was approached by a nice young man called Tim Berners-Lee

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000
who said, "Are you Ian Ritchie?" and I said, "Yeah."

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000
And he said, "I need to talk to you."

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.000
And he told me about his proposed system called the World Wide Web.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.000
And I thought, well, that's got a pretentious name,

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.000
especially since the whole system ran on his computer in his office.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.000
But he was completely convinced that his World Wide Web

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000
would take over the world one day.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
And he tried to persuade me to write the browser for it,

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.000
because his system didn't have any graphics or fonts or layout or anything;

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000
it was just plain text.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.000
I thought, well, you know, interesting,

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000
but a guy from CERN, he's not going to do this.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000
So we didn't do it.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000
In the next couple of years,

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000
the hypertext community didn't recognize him either.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.000
In 1992, his paper was rejected for the Hypertext Conference.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000
In 1993,

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000
there was a table at the conference in Seattle,

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
and a guy called Marc Andreessen

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000
was demonstrating his little browser for the World Wide Web.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000
And I saw it, and I thought, yep, that's it.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000
And the very next year, in 1994, we had the conference here in Edinburgh,

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.000
and I had no opposition in having Tim Berners-Lee as the keynote speaker.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000
So that puts me in pretty illustrious company.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000
There was a guy called Dick Rowe

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000
who was at Decca Records and turned down The Beatles.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000
There was a guy called Gary Kildall

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000
who went flying his plane

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
when IBM came looking for an operating system

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000
for the IBM PC,

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000
and he wasn't there, so they went back to see Bill Gates.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000
And the 12 publishers

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.000
who turned down J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter, I guess.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000
On the other hand, there's Marc Andreessen

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000
who wrote the world's first browser for the World Wide Web.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000
And according to Fortune magazine,

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000
he's worth 700 million dollars.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000
But is he happy?

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000
(Laughter)

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:20.000
(Applause)
