WEBVTT

00:00:00.326 --> 00:00:02.112
Well, good afternoon, everybody.

00:00:02.136 --> 00:00:04.985
Thank you all very much
for coming along today.

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:08.595
I'd like to begin my talk with a story.

00:00:08.619 --> 00:00:11.092
It's a story that begins,
but does not end,

00:00:11.116 --> 00:00:13.757
with a mathematician named Tim Gowers.

00:00:14.401 --> 00:00:17.625
Gowers is one of the world's most
renowned mathematicians.

00:00:17.649 --> 00:00:20.229
He's a professor at Cambridge University

00:00:20.253 --> 00:00:22.542
and a recipient of the Fields Medal,

00:00:22.566 --> 00:00:25.306
often called the Nobel Prize
of mathematics.

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:28.710
Gowers is also a blogger,

00:00:29.602 --> 00:00:35.707
and in January of 2009, he used his blog
to pose a very striking question:

00:00:36.588 --> 00:00:41.182
Is massively collaborative
mathematics possible?

00:00:42.321 --> 00:00:45.204
So what he was proposing in this post

00:00:45.228 --> 00:00:50.144
was to use his blog to attack a difficult
unsolved mathematical problem --

00:00:50.168 --> 00:00:53.016
a problem which he said
he would "love to solve" --

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:54.512
completely in the open,

00:00:54.536 --> 00:00:58.945
using his blog to post his ideas
and his partial progress.

00:01:00.096 --> 00:01:03.470
What's more, he issued an open invitation,

00:01:03.494 --> 00:01:08.057
inviting anybody in the world who thought
that they had an idea to contribute

00:01:08.081 --> 00:01:12.265
to post their idea
in the comment section of the blog.

00:01:13.335 --> 00:01:17.362
His hope was that by combining
the ideas of many minds,

00:01:17.386 --> 00:01:20.406
he could make easy work
of his hard mathematical problem.

00:01:20.954 --> 00:01:23.556
He called this experiment
the Polymath Project.

00:01:24.914 --> 00:01:27.344
Well, the Polymath Project
got off to a slow start.

00:01:27.368 --> 00:01:29.964
In the first seven hours,
nobody posted any comments.

00:01:30.537 --> 00:01:34.050
But then, a mathematician
from the University of British Columbia

00:01:34.074 --> 00:01:35.621
named Jozsef Solymosi

00:01:35.645 --> 00:01:37.330
posted a short comment.

00:01:37.354 --> 00:01:40.343
And this seemed to break the ice,
because a few minutes later,

00:01:40.367 --> 00:01:44.009
a high school teacher named
Jason Dyer posted a suggestion.

00:01:44.033 --> 00:01:45.758
And a few minutes after that,

00:01:45.782 --> 00:01:49.537
another mathematician named
Terence Tao, also a Fields medalist,

00:01:49.561 --> 00:01:51.200
posted an idea.

00:01:51.224 --> 00:01:54.567
And things really started
to move quickly at this point.

00:01:54.591 --> 00:01:56.688
Over the next 37 days,

00:01:56.712 --> 00:02:01.811
27 different people would post
800 substantive comments

00:02:01.835 --> 00:02:05.827
containing 170,000 words.

00:02:06.414 --> 00:02:09.571
I was not a serious participant,
but I was following along closely

00:02:09.595 --> 00:02:10.747
from the start,

00:02:10.771 --> 00:02:12.433
and it was just amazing.

00:02:12.457 --> 00:02:15.335
The speed with which an idea
would be tentatively proposed

00:02:15.359 --> 00:02:19.234
and then really rapidly developed
by other people and improved,

00:02:19.258 --> 00:02:20.432
sometimes discarded --

00:02:20.456 --> 00:02:21.788
it was just amazing.

00:02:22.261 --> 00:02:24.533
Gowers described the process

00:02:24.557 --> 00:02:29.347
as being to ordinary research
"as driving is to pushing a car."

00:02:29.371 --> 00:02:30.594
(Laughter)

00:02:31.396 --> 00:02:33.822
At the end of the 37 days,

00:02:33.846 --> 00:02:37.709
Gowers used his blog to announce
that they had solved the core problem;

00:02:37.733 --> 00:02:41.234
in fact, they had solved a harder
generalization of the problem.

00:02:41.258 --> 00:02:43.413
The Polymath Project had succeeded.

00:02:44.424 --> 00:02:47.767
So what the Polymath Project
suggests, at least to me,

00:02:47.791 --> 00:02:51.920
is that we can use
the internet to build tools

00:02:51.944 --> 00:02:54.736
that actually expand our ability

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:58.255
to solve the most challenging
intellectual problems.

00:02:59.523 --> 00:03:01.278
Or, to put it in another way:

00:03:01.302 --> 00:03:05.955
we can build tools which actively amplify
our collective intelligence

00:03:05.979 --> 00:03:10.463
in much the same way as, for millennia,
we've used physical tools

00:03:10.487 --> 00:03:12.268
to amplify our strength.

00:03:14.469 --> 00:03:15.623
OK?

00:03:15.647 --> 00:03:19.260
So what I'd like to talk about today,
or what I'd like to explore today,

00:03:19.284 --> 00:03:21.742
is what this means for science.

00:03:21.766 --> 00:03:25.501
It's much more important than just solving
a single mathematical problem.

00:03:25.525 --> 00:03:28.974
It means an expansion in the range
of scientific problems

00:03:28.998 --> 00:03:31.197
we can hope to attack at all.

00:03:31.221 --> 00:03:35.305
It means, potentially, an acceleration
in the rate of scientific discovery.

00:03:35.329 --> 00:03:38.686
It means a change in the way
we construct knowledge itself.

00:03:39.471 --> 00:03:42.354
So, before I get too overexcited, however,

00:03:42.378 --> 00:03:45.344
I would like to talk
about some of the challenges,

00:03:45.368 --> 00:03:46.524
some of the problems.

00:03:46.548 --> 00:03:50.173
Particularly, I'd like to describe
a failure of this approach.

00:03:50.788 --> 00:03:54.324
It occurred in 2005, or started in 2005.

00:03:54.348 --> 00:03:59.716
A grad student at Caltech named
John Stockton had a very good idea

00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:02.480
for what he called the "Quantum Wiki,"

00:04:02.504 --> 00:04:04.505
or "Qwiki" for short.

00:04:04.529 --> 00:04:05.670
(Laughter)

00:04:05.694 --> 00:04:07.403
OK? It's a great idea.

00:04:07.427 --> 00:04:10.407
What he did with the Qwiki was --

00:04:10.431 --> 00:04:13.732
the idea of the Qwiki was that it
was going to be a great repository

00:04:13.756 --> 00:04:14.910
of human knowledge,

00:04:14.934 --> 00:04:16.250
much like Wikipedia.

00:04:16.274 --> 00:04:19.128
But instead of being focused
on general knowledge,

00:04:19.152 --> 00:04:23.534
it was going to be focused on
specialist knowledge in quantum computing.

00:04:24.204 --> 00:04:27.125
It was going be kind of
a supertextbook for the field,

00:04:27.149 --> 00:04:29.619
with information about
all the latest research,

00:04:29.643 --> 00:04:32.952
about what the big open problems
in the field were,

00:04:32.976 --> 00:04:35.527
people's speculation
about how to solve the problems,

00:04:35.551 --> 00:04:36.711
and so on.

00:04:37.353 --> 00:04:41.879
Like Wikipedia, the intention was
that it would be written by the users,

00:04:41.903 --> 00:04:44.640
in this case, by experts
in quantum computing.

00:04:45.578 --> 00:04:50.044
I was present at the conference at Caltech
in 2005, when it was announced.

00:04:50.532 --> 00:04:53.599
And some of the people who I spoke to
were very skeptical,

00:04:53.623 --> 00:04:56.654
but some of the people
were very excited by the idea.

00:04:56.678 --> 00:04:58.696
They were impressed by the implementation;

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:01.456
they were impressed by the amount
of initial seed material

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:02.965
which had been put on the site;

00:05:02.989 --> 00:05:05.346
and most of all,
they were excited by the vision.

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:07.116
But just because they were excited,

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:10.328
didn't mean they wanted
to take the time themselves to contribute.

00:05:10.843 --> 00:05:13.418
They hoped that other people would do so.

00:05:13.861 --> 00:05:16.692
And in the end, nobody, essentially,

00:05:16.716 --> 00:05:19.288
was really all that interested
in contributing.

00:05:20.324 --> 00:05:23.315
If you look today,
except in a few small corners,

00:05:23.339 --> 00:05:25.012
the Qwiki is essentially dead.

00:05:25.866 --> 00:05:28.584
And, sad to say,
this is quite a common story.

00:05:28.608 --> 00:05:32.666
Many scientists, in fields ranging
from genetics to string theory,

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:36.737
have tried to start science wikis
along very similar lines.

00:05:36.761 --> 00:05:39.922
And typically, they've failed
for essentially the same reason.

00:05:40.732 --> 00:05:42.628
It's not just science wikis, either.

00:05:42.652 --> 00:05:44.699
Inspired by Facebook,

00:05:44.723 --> 00:05:48.852
many organizations have tried to create
social networks for scientists,

00:05:48.876 --> 00:05:53.037
which will connect scientists
to other people with similar interests.

00:05:54.856 --> 00:05:59.072
So they can share things like data
or code, their ideas and so on.

00:05:59.096 --> 00:06:00.973
Again, it sounds like a good idea.

00:06:00.997 --> 00:06:03.241
But if you join one of these sites,

00:06:03.265 --> 00:06:06.103
you'll quickly discover
that they're essentially empty.

00:06:06.127 --> 00:06:07.965
They're virtual ghost towns.

00:06:09.988 --> 00:06:12.153
So what's going on?
What's the problem here?

00:06:12.177 --> 00:06:14.453
Why are these promising sites failing?

00:06:14.477 --> 00:06:18.589
Well, imagine that you're
an ambitious young scientist.

00:06:18.613 --> 00:06:22.064
In fact, I know some of you here
are ambitious young scientists.

00:06:22.088 --> 00:06:24.561
Imagine you're
an ambitious young scientist.

00:06:24.585 --> 00:06:28.544
You really would like to get a job --
a permanent job, a good job --

00:06:28.568 --> 00:06:30.130
doing the work that you love.

00:06:30.850 --> 00:06:33.185
But it's incredibly competitive
to get such jobs.

00:06:33.209 --> 00:06:37.260
Often, there'll be hundreds of very
highly qualified applicants for positions.

00:06:38.912 --> 00:06:43.121
And so you find yourself working
60, 70, 80 hours a week,

00:06:43.145 --> 00:06:47.630
doing the one thing that you know
will get you such a job,

00:06:47.654 --> 00:06:49.916
and that is writing scientific papers.

00:06:50.770 --> 00:06:53.911
You may think that the Qwiki
is a wonderful idea in principle,

00:06:53.935 --> 00:06:57.168
but you also know that writing
a single mediocre paper

00:06:57.192 --> 00:07:00.230
will do much more for your career
and your job prospects

00:07:00.254 --> 00:07:04.126
than a long series of brilliant
contributions to such a site.

00:07:04.725 --> 00:07:06.504
So even though you may like the idea

00:07:06.528 --> 00:07:09.270
and you may think it will advance
science more quickly,

00:07:09.294 --> 00:07:13.121
you find you just can't conceive of it
as being part of your job.

00:07:13.145 --> 00:07:14.378
It's not.

00:07:15.019 --> 00:07:19.164
The only things which can succeed
in this kind of environment

00:07:19.188 --> 00:07:21.631
are projects like the Polymath Project,

00:07:21.655 --> 00:07:25.800
which, even though they employ
an unconventional means to an end,

00:07:27.221 --> 00:07:29.531
they have an essential
conservatism about them.

00:07:29.555 --> 00:07:33.543
The end product of the Polymath Project
was still a scientific paper.

00:07:33.567 --> 00:07:35.854
In fact, it was several papers. Right?

00:07:35.878 --> 00:07:39.195
So unconventional means,
but conventional ends.

00:07:39.219 --> 00:07:41.234
So there's a kind of
conservatism about it.

00:07:41.258 --> 00:07:44.952
And don't get me wrong --
the Polymath Project is terrific,

00:07:44.976 --> 00:07:49.355
but it is a pity that scientists
can only use tools

00:07:49.379 --> 00:07:51.807
which have this kind of
conservative nature.

00:07:52.500 --> 00:07:54.604
So let me tell you a story
about an instance

00:07:54.628 --> 00:07:57.747
where we moved away
from this conservatism.

00:07:57.771 --> 00:08:00.988
It's a rare story where
the conservatism has been broken.

00:08:01.426 --> 00:08:04.721
It occurred in the 1990s,
when, as you know,

00:08:04.745 --> 00:08:09.178
for the first time, biologists were taking
large amounts of genetic data

00:08:09.202 --> 00:08:11.334
to collect in the Human Genome Project.

00:08:11.846 --> 00:08:14.192
And there were sites online

00:08:14.216 --> 00:08:17.522
which would allow biologists
to upload that data

00:08:17.546 --> 00:08:20.223
so it could be shared
with other people around the world

00:08:20.247 --> 00:08:22.068
and analyzed by other people.

00:08:22.983 --> 00:08:25.519
Probably the best known of these
is the site GenBank,

00:08:25.543 --> 00:08:28.018
which some of you may
have heard of or used.

00:08:28.667 --> 00:08:30.628
And these sites, like GenBank,

00:08:30.652 --> 00:08:36.960
had the problem in common with Qwiki
that scientists -- they're not paid

00:08:36.984 --> 00:08:39.590
or rewarded for sharing their data.

00:08:39.614 --> 00:08:42.774
It's all about publishing papers.

00:08:42.798 --> 00:08:46.841
So there was a considerable reluctance
to actually upload the data.

00:08:47.381 --> 00:08:50.179
Yet, everybody could see
that this was silly --

00:08:50.203 --> 00:08:52.737
it was obvious that this
was the right thing to do.

00:08:52.761 --> 00:08:54.311
But just because it was obvious

00:08:54.335 --> 00:08:56.546
didn't mean that people
were actually doing it.

00:08:56.570 --> 00:08:59.611
So a meeting was convened
in Bermuda in 1996

00:08:59.635 --> 00:09:02.601
of many of the world's leading
molecular biologists.

00:09:02.625 --> 00:09:05.513
And they sat and they discussed
the problem for several days,

00:09:05.537 --> 00:09:08.840
and they came up with what are now
called the Bermuda Principles,

00:09:08.864 --> 00:09:10.040
which state that:

00:09:10.064 --> 00:09:14.194
first, once human genetic data
is taken in the lab,

00:09:14.218 --> 00:09:16.152
it should be immediately uploaded

00:09:16.176 --> 00:09:17.764
to a site like GenBank;

00:09:17.788 --> 00:09:20.891
and two, that the data
would be in the public domain.

00:09:21.963 --> 00:09:23.793
And these principles were given teeth,

00:09:23.817 --> 00:09:26.873
because they were taken by the big
scientific grant agencies --

00:09:26.897 --> 00:09:30.148
the US National Institutes of Health,
the UK Wellcome Trust --

00:09:30.172 --> 00:09:32.120
and actually baked into policy.

00:09:35.147 --> 00:09:38.991
So it meant that if you were a scientist
who wanted to work on the human genome,

00:09:39.015 --> 00:09:41.239
you had to agree to abide
by these principles.

00:09:41.263 --> 00:09:44.128
And today, I'm very pleased
to say, as a result,

00:09:44.152 --> 00:09:48.029
you can go online -- anybody here --
and download the human genome.

00:09:48.963 --> 00:09:50.805
So that's a terrific story.

00:09:50.829 --> 00:09:53.548
But the human genome
is just a tiny, tiny fraction

00:09:53.572 --> 00:09:55.631
of all scientific knowledge.

00:09:56.727 --> 00:09:59.783
Even just in other parts of genetics,

00:09:59.807 --> 00:10:02.257
there is so much knowledge
that is still locked up.

00:10:02.281 --> 00:10:04.359
I spoke with one bioinformatician

00:10:04.383 --> 00:10:09.800
who told me that he'd been "sitting
on the genome of an entire species

00:10:09.824 --> 00:10:11.235
for more than a year."

00:10:12.193 --> 00:10:13.724
An entire species.

00:10:14.779 --> 00:10:16.362
And in other parts of science,

00:10:16.386 --> 00:10:20.181
it is routine that scientists
hoard their data.

00:10:20.205 --> 00:10:22.601
They hoard the computer code
that they write

00:10:22.625 --> 00:10:25.044
that could be useful,
potentially, to other people.

00:10:25.068 --> 00:10:26.992
They hoard their best ideas.

00:10:27.016 --> 00:10:29.854
And they often hoard even
the descriptions of the problems

00:10:29.878 --> 00:10:31.790
that they think are most interesting.

00:10:32.347 --> 00:10:35.647
And so, what I and other people
in the Open Science movement

00:10:35.671 --> 00:10:36.839
would like to do is,

00:10:36.863 --> 00:10:38.709
we'd like to change this situation.

00:10:38.733 --> 00:10:41.214
We would like to change
the culture of science

00:10:41.238 --> 00:10:43.877
so that scientists become
much more strongly motivated

00:10:43.901 --> 00:10:46.544
to share all of these
different kinds of knowledge.

00:10:46.568 --> 00:10:50.987
We want to change the values
of individual scientists

00:10:51.011 --> 00:10:54.508
so they start to see it
as part of their job

00:10:54.532 --> 00:10:57.062
to be sharing their data,
to be sharing their code,

00:10:57.086 --> 00:11:00.595
to be sharing their best ideas
and their problems.

00:11:01.956 --> 00:11:07.394
So, if we can do this,
this kind of change in values,

00:11:07.418 --> 00:11:11.956
then we will indeed start to see
individual scientists rewarded

00:11:11.980 --> 00:11:13.142
for doing these things;

00:11:13.166 --> 00:11:15.028
there will be incentives to do them.

00:11:15.463 --> 00:11:18.177
It's a difficult thing to do, however.

00:11:18.758 --> 00:11:23.699
We're talking about changing the culture
of entire large parts of science.

00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:27.490
But it has happened
before once in history,

00:11:27.514 --> 00:11:29.666
right back at the dawn of science.

00:11:30.503 --> 00:11:36.865
Galileo, 1609: he points his telescope
up at the sky towards Saturn,

00:11:36.889 --> 00:11:39.490
and he sees for the first time in history

00:11:39.514 --> 00:11:41.605
what we now know are the rings of Saturn.

00:11:42.208 --> 00:11:44.004
Does he tell everybody in the world?

00:11:44.028 --> 00:11:45.283
No, he doesn't do that.

00:11:45.307 --> 00:11:47.909
He writes down a description, privately,

00:11:47.933 --> 00:11:52.924
and then he scrambles the letters
in the description into an anagram,

00:11:52.948 --> 00:11:57.227
and he sends that anagram
to several of his astronomer rivals.

00:11:57.251 --> 00:11:58.411
(Laughter)

00:11:58.435 --> 00:12:04.955
And what this ensures is that,
if they later make the same discovery,

00:12:04.979 --> 00:12:07.465
he can reveal the anagram
and get the credit,

00:12:08.411 --> 00:12:11.622
but in the meantime, he hasn't given up
any knowledge at all.

00:12:11.646 --> 00:12:14.859
And I'm sad to say that he was
not uncommon at the time:

00:12:14.883 --> 00:12:19.670
Newton, Huygens, Hooke, Leonardo --
they all used similar devices.

00:12:20.351 --> 00:12:21.524
OK?

00:12:22.724 --> 00:12:27.201
The printing press had been around
for 150 years by this time.

00:12:27.225 --> 00:12:30.633
And yet, there was a great battle
in the 17th and 18th centuries

00:12:30.657 --> 00:12:33.120
to change the culture of science,

00:12:33.144 --> 00:12:36.773
so that it became expected
that when a scientist made a discovery,

00:12:36.797 --> 00:12:39.300
they would reveal it in a journal.

00:12:40.516 --> 00:12:44.169
Now, that's great that that change
has happened. It's terrific.

00:12:44.193 --> 00:12:46.123
But today, we have new technologies,

00:12:46.147 --> 00:12:50.576
we have new opportunities
to share our knowledge in new ways

00:12:50.600 --> 00:12:52.706
and the ability to create tools

00:12:52.730 --> 00:12:57.240
that actually allow us
to solve problems in entirely new ways.

00:12:58.599 --> 00:13:02.338
So we need to have a second
open science revolution.

00:13:02.362 --> 00:13:03.588
It is my belief

00:13:03.612 --> 00:13:07.771
that any publicly funded science
should be open science.

00:13:08.750 --> 00:13:11.118
How can we achieve this change?

00:13:11.972 --> 00:13:16.436
Well, if you're a scientist -- and I know
many of you are not scientists,

00:13:16.460 --> 00:13:17.809
but if you are a scientist,

00:13:17.833 --> 00:13:19.930
then there are things that you can do.

00:13:19.954 --> 00:13:23.393
You can get involved
in an open science project,

00:13:23.417 --> 00:13:26.494
even if it's just for a small
fraction of your time.

00:13:26.933 --> 00:13:29.735
You can find forums online

00:13:29.759 --> 00:13:32.312
where you can share
your knowledge in new ways,

00:13:32.336 --> 00:13:35.508
ways that allow other people
to build on that knowledge.

00:13:36.332 --> 00:13:39.345
You can also, if you're more ambitious,

00:13:39.369 --> 00:13:41.844
start an open science project of your own.

00:13:41.868 --> 00:13:44.194
If you're really bold,
you may wish to experiment

00:13:44.218 --> 00:13:46.447
with entirely new ways of collaborating,

00:13:46.471 --> 00:13:49.535
in much the same way
as the Polymath Project did.

00:13:50.627 --> 00:13:55.525
But above all, what you should do
is be very generous in giving credit

00:13:55.549 --> 00:13:59.131
to those of your colleagues
who are practicing science in the open

00:13:59.155 --> 00:14:00.983
and to promote their work.

00:14:01.578 --> 00:14:05.116
It is only conservative scientific values

00:14:05.140 --> 00:14:09.648
that look down on these activities --
the sharing of data, the blogging,

00:14:09.672 --> 00:14:11.526
or using of wikis and so on.

00:14:12.677 --> 00:14:15.162
You can reject those conservative values

00:14:15.186 --> 00:14:18.014
and engage your scientific
colleagues in conversation

00:14:18.038 --> 00:14:21.520
to promote the value
of these new ways of working,

00:14:21.544 --> 00:14:24.455
to emphasize that it takes bravery
to do these things,

00:14:24.479 --> 00:14:26.471
particularly by young scientists.

00:14:26.495 --> 00:14:31.456
It's through such conversation that
the culture of science can be changed.

00:14:32.694 --> 00:14:34.790
So if you are not a scientist,

00:14:34.814 --> 00:14:36.795
there are also things that you can do.

00:14:37.405 --> 00:14:42.232
My belief is that the single most
important thing that we can do

00:14:42.256 --> 00:14:45.545
to give impetus to open science

00:14:45.569 --> 00:14:50.226
is to create a general awareness
amongst the population

00:14:50.250 --> 00:14:54.579
of the issue of open science
and of its critical importance.

00:14:54.990 --> 00:14:57.368
If there is that general awareness,

00:14:57.392 --> 00:15:00.856
then the scientific community
will inevitably find --

00:15:00.880 --> 00:15:03.844
it will be dragged
by the population at large

00:15:03.868 --> 00:15:05.167
in the right direction.

00:15:05.855 --> 00:15:07.578
There are simple things you can do.

00:15:07.602 --> 00:15:10.716
You can talk to your friends
and acquaintances who are scientists

00:15:10.740 --> 00:15:13.693
and just ask them
what are they doing to work more openly.

00:15:13.717 --> 00:15:16.631
Or you can use your imagination
and your personal power

00:15:16.655 --> 00:15:18.870
to raise awareness in other ways.

00:15:19.414 --> 00:15:22.155
We're talking about changing
not just what scientists do

00:15:22.179 --> 00:15:23.775
but what grant agencies do,

00:15:23.799 --> 00:15:26.521
what universities do
and what governments do.

00:15:26.545 --> 00:15:29.112
And you can influence all of those things.

00:15:31.009 --> 00:15:34.332
Our society faces a fundamental question:

00:15:35.403 --> 00:15:38.519
What kinds of knowledge
are we going to expect

00:15:38.543 --> 00:15:42.012
and incentivize our scientists to share?

00:15:42.036 --> 00:15:44.752
Will we continue
as we have done in the past?

00:15:45.184 --> 00:15:48.700
Or will we embrace new kinds of sharing,

00:15:48.724 --> 00:15:52.081
which lead to new methods
for solving problems

00:15:52.105 --> 00:15:54.663
and an acceleration
in the process of science,

00:15:54.687 --> 00:15:56.388
entirely across the board?

00:15:57.311 --> 00:16:00.981
My hope is that we will
embrace open science

00:16:01.005 --> 00:16:04.050
and really seize
this opportunity that we have

00:16:04.074 --> 00:16:06.547
to reinvent discovery itself.

00:16:07.650 --> 00:16:11.481
Thank you. (Applause)
