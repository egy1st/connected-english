WEBVTT

00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:04.976
Okay, now I don't want
to alarm anybody in this room,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.976
but it's just come to my attention
that the person to your right is a liar.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.976
(Laughter)

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.976
Also, the person to your left is a liar.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.976
Also the person sitting
in your very seats is a liar.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.976
We're all liars.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:20.976
What I'm going to do today

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.576
is I'm going to show you what the research
says about why we're all liars,

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.176
how you can become a liespotter

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:28.976
and why you might want
to go the extra mile

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.976
and go from liespotting to truth seeking,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:33.976
and ultimately to trust building.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.976
Now, speaking of trust,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.976
ever since I wrote
this book, "Liespotting,"

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.976
no one wants to meet me in person
anymore, no, no, no, no, no.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.976
They say, "It's okay, we'll email you."

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:47.976
(Laughter)

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.976
I can't even get
a coffee date at Starbucks.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.976
My husband's like, "Honey, deception?

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.191
Maybe you could have focused on cooking.
How about French cooking?"

00:00:57.215 --> 00:00:59.358
So before I get started,
what I'm going to do

00:00:59.382 --> 00:01:01.976
is I'm going to clarify my goal for you,

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:03.976
which is not to teach a game of Gotcha.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.976
Liespotters aren't those nitpicky kids,

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.334
those kids in the back of the room
that are shouting, "Gotcha! Gotcha!

00:01:09.358 --> 00:01:11.976
Your eyebrow twitched.
You flared your nostril.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.976
I watch that TV show 'Lie To Me.'
I know you're lying."

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.976
No, liespotters are armed

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.976
with scientific knowledge
of how to spot deception.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.976
They use it to get to the truth,

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.096
and they do what mature
leaders do everyday;

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:26.976
they have difficult conversations
with difficult people,

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.976
sometimes during very difficult times.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.976
And they start up that path
by accepting a core proposition,

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.976
and that proposition is the following:

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.468
Lying is a cooperative act.

00:01:38.777 --> 00:01:41.976
Think about it, a lie has no power
whatsoever by its mere utterance.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.976
Its power emerges

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.096
when someone else agrees
to believe the lie.

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:48.096
So I know it may sound like tough love,

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:51.976
but look, if at some point
you got lied to,

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.976
it's because you agreed to get lied to.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.976
Truth number one about lying:
Lying's a cooperative act.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.976
Now not all lies are harmful.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.976
Sometimes we're willing
participants in deception

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.976
for the sake of social dignity,

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.976
maybe to keep a secret that should
be kept secret, secret.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.976
We say, "Nice song."

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.976
"Honey, you don't look fat in that, no."

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.976
Or we say, favorite of the digiratti,

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.976
"You know, I just fished
that email out of my Spam folder.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.976
So sorry."

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.239
But there are times when we are unwilling
participants in deception.

00:02:24.263 --> 00:02:26.976
And that can have dramatic costs for us.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.976
Last year saw 997 billion dollars

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.579
in corporate fraud alone
in the United States.

00:02:34.333 --> 00:02:36.348
That's an eyelash
under a trillion dollars.

00:02:36.372 --> 00:02:37.976
That's seven percent of revenues.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.976
Deception can cost billions.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.976
Think Enron, Madoff, the mortgage crisis.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.976
Or in the case
of double agents and traitors,

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.976
like Robert Hanssen or Aldrich Ames,

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.976
lies can betray our country,

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000
they can compromise our security,
they can undermine democracy,

00:02:53.024 --> 00:02:55.976
they can cause the deaths
of those that defend us.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.976
Deception is actually serious business.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.976
This con man, Henry Oberlander,
he was such an effective con man,

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.976
British authorities say

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.476
he could have undermined the entire
banking system of the Western world.

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:11.676
And you can't find this guy on Google;
you can't find him anywhere.

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:14.176
He was interviewed once,
and he said the following.

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:15.876
He said, "Look, I've got one rule."

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:17.976
And this was Henry's rule, he said,

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.376
"Look, everyone is willing
to give you something.

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:23.972
They're ready to give you something
for whatever it is they're hungry for."

00:03:23.996 --> 00:03:25.376
And that's the crux of it.

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:27.829
If you don't want to be
deceived, you have to know,

00:03:27.853 --> 00:03:29.529
what is it that you're hungry for?

00:03:29.553 --> 00:03:31.976
And we all kind of hate to admit it.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.976
We wish we were
better husbands, better wives,

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.976
smarter, more powerful, taller, richer --

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:40.976
the list goes on.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:42.976
Lying is an attempt to bridge that gap,

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.976
to connect our wishes and our fantasies

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.976
about who we wish we were,
how we wish we could be,

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.976
with what we're really like.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.239
And boy are we willing to fill in
those gaps in our lives with lies.

00:03:54.263 --> 00:03:56.976
On a given day, studies show
that you may be lied to

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.976
anywhere from 10 to 200 times.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.976
Now granted, many of those are white lies.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:03.976
But in another study,

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:05.976
it showed that strangers lied three times

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.381
within the first 10 minutes
of meeting each other.

00:04:08.405 --> 00:04:09.976
(Laughter)

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.976
Now when we first hear
this data, we recoil.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:14.976
We can't believe how prevalent lying is.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:16.976
We're essentially against lying.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.976
But if you look more closely,
the plot actually thickens.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.976
We lie more to strangers
than we lie to coworkers.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.976
Extroverts lie more than introverts.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.976
Men lie eight times more about themselves
than they do other people.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.976
Women lie more to protect other people.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.976
If you're an average married couple,

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.976
you're going to lie to your spouse
in one out of every 10 interactions.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:44.976
Now, you may think that's bad.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.286
If you're unmarried,
that number drops to three.

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:48.976
Lying's complex.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.000
It's woven into the fabric
of our daily and our business lives.

00:04:52.024 --> 00:04:53.976
We're deeply ambivalent about the truth.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:55.976
We parse it out on an as-needed basis,

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:57.976
sometimes for very good reasons,

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.191
other times just because
we don't understand the gaps in our lives.

00:05:01.215 --> 00:05:02.976
That's truth number two about lying.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:04.976
We're against lying,

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:06.976
but we're covertly for it

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:11.000
in ways that our society has sanctioned
for centuries and centuries and centuries.

00:05:11.024 --> 00:05:12.976
It's as old as breathing.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.429
It's part of our culture,
it's part of our history.

00:05:15.453 --> 00:05:20.976
Think Dante, Shakespeare,
the Bible, News of the World.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:22.976
(Laughter)

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.286
Lying has evolutionary value
to us as a species.

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:28.976
Researchers have long known
that the more intelligent the species,

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:30.976
the larger the neocortex,

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:32.976
the more likely it is to be deceptive.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:34.976
Now you might remember Koko.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.239
Does anybody remember Koko the gorilla
who was taught sign language?

00:05:38.263 --> 00:05:40.976
Koko was taught to communicate
via sign language.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:42.976
Here's Koko with her kitten.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.976
It's her cute little, fluffy pet kitten.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.976
Koko once blamed her pet kitten
for ripping a sink out of the wall.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:51.976
(Laughter)

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.191
We're hardwired to become
leaders of the pack.

00:05:54.215 --> 00:05:55.976
It's starts really, really early.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:57.976
How early?

00:05:58.000 --> 00:05:59.976
Well babies will fake a cry,

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:01.976
pause, wait to see who's coming

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:03.976
and then go right back to crying.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:05.976
One-year-olds learn concealment.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:07.976
(Laughter)

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:09.976
Two-year-olds bluff.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:11.976
Five-year-olds lie outright.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:13.976
They manipulate via flattery.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.976
Nine-year-olds, masters of the cover-up.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:18.976
By the time you enter college,

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.376
you're going to lie to your mom
in one out of every five interactions.

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:25.276
By the time we enter this work world
and we're breadwinners,

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:28.976
we enter a world that is just cluttered
with Spam, fake digital friends,

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:30.976
partisan media,

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:32.976
ingenious identity thieves,

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:34.976
world-class Ponzi schemers,

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:36.976
a deception epidemic --

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:41.977
in short, what one author calls
a post-truth society.

00:06:42.001 --> 00:06:45.966
It's been very confusing
for a long time now.

00:06:48.665 --> 00:06:49.976
What do you do?

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.976
Well, there are steps we can take
to navigate our way through the morass.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.976
Trained liespotters get to the truth
90 percent of the time.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.976
The rest of us,
we're only 54 percent accurate.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:01.976
Why is it so easy to learn?

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.215
There are good liars and bad liars.

00:07:04.239 --> 00:07:05.876
There are no real original liars.

00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:08.876
We all make the same mistakes.
We all use the same techniques.

00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:12.529
So what I'm going to do is I'm going
to show you two patterns of deception.

00:07:12.553 --> 00:07:14.752
And then we're going
to look at the hot spots

00:07:14.776 --> 00:07:16.629
and see if we can find them ourselves.

00:07:16.653 --> 00:07:18.276
We're going to start with speech.

00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:20.634
(Video) Bill Clinton:
I want you to listen to me.

00:07:20.658 --> 00:07:22.076
I'm going to say this again.

00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:28.976
I did not have sexual relations
with that woman, Miss Lewinsky.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:32.976
I never told anybody to lie,
not a single time, never.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.976
And these allegations are false.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.572
And I need to go back to work
for the American people.

00:07:38.596 --> 00:07:40.572
Thank you.

00:07:40.596 --> 00:07:42.108
(Applause)

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.976
Pamela Meyer: Okay,
what were the telltale signs?

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:49.976
Well first we heard what's known
as a non-contracted denial.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:53.000
Studies show that people
who are overdetermined in their denial

00:07:53.024 --> 00:07:55.976
will resort to formal rather
than informal language.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.976
We also heard
distancing language: "that woman."

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.715
We know that liars will unconsciously
distance themselves

00:08:01.739 --> 00:08:02.976
from their subject,

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.976
using language as their tool.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:09.048
Now if Bill Clinton had said,
"Well, to tell you the truth ..."

00:08:09.072 --> 00:08:11.363
or Richard Nixon's favorite,
"In all candor ..."

00:08:11.387 --> 00:08:13.076
he would have been a dead giveaway

00:08:13.100 --> 00:08:14.976
for any liespotter that knows

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.429
that qualifying language, as it's called,
qualifying language like that,

00:08:18.453 --> 00:08:19.976
further discredits the subject.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.976
Now if he had repeated
the question in its entirety,

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:26.976
or if he had peppered his account
with a little too much detail --

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.191
and we're all really glad
he didn't do that --

00:08:29.215 --> 00:08:31.215
he would have further discredited himself.

00:08:31.239 --> 00:08:32.976
Freud had it right.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.976
Freud said, look,
there's much more to it than speech:

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.976
"No mortal can keep a secret.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.976
If his lips are silent,
he chatters with his fingertips."

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.976
And we all do it no matter
how powerful you are.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:46.976
We all chatter with our fingertips.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.976
I'm going to show you
Dominique Strauss-Kahn with Obama

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.976
who's chattering with his fingertips.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.976
(Laughter)

00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:01.976
Now this brings us to our next pattern,
which is body language.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.976
With body language,
here's what you've got to do.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.976
You've really got to just throw
your assumptions out the door.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.429
Let the science temper
your knowledge a little bit.

00:09:10.453 --> 00:09:12.976
Because we think liars
fidget all the time.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:16.762
Well guess what, they're known to freeze
their upper bodies when they're lying.

00:09:16.786 --> 00:09:18.976
We think liars won't look you in the eyes.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.876
Well guess what, they look
you in the eyes a little too much

00:09:21.900 --> 00:09:23.476
just to compensate for that myth.

00:09:23.500 --> 00:09:26.976
We think warmth and smiles
convey honesty, sincerity.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:30.976
But a trained liespotter
can spot a fake smile a mile away.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:34.000
Can you all spot the fake smile here?

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:39.976
You can consciously contract
the muscles in your cheeks.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.976
But the real smile's in the eyes,
the crow's feet of the eyes.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:44.976
They cannot be consciously contracted,

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:46.976
especially if you overdid the Botox.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.976
Don't overdo the Botox;
nobody will think you're honest.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:51.976
Now we're going to look at the hot spots.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.286
Can you tell what's happening
in a conversation?

00:09:54.310 --> 00:09:56.976
Can you start to find the hot spots

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:58.976
to see the discrepancies

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.191
between someone's words
and someone's actions?

00:10:01.215 --> 00:10:02.976
Now, I know it seems really obvious,

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:07.976
but when you're having a conversation
with someone you suspect of deception,

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:11.076
attitude is by far the most overlooked
but telling of indicators.

00:10:11.100 --> 00:10:13.296
An honest person
is going to be cooperative.

00:10:13.320 --> 00:10:15.368
They're going to show
they're on your side.

00:10:15.392 --> 00:10:16.976
They're going to be enthusiastic.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:20.276
They're going to be willing and helpful
to getting you to the truth.

00:10:20.300 --> 00:10:23.076
They're going to be willing
to brainstorm, name suspects,

00:10:23.100 --> 00:10:24.376
provide details.

00:10:24.400 --> 00:10:25.976
They're going to say,

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:29.176
"Hey, maybe it was those guys in payroll
that forged those checks."

00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:32.476
They're going to be infuriated
if they sense they're wrongly accused

00:10:32.500 --> 00:10:35.676
throughout the entire course
of the interview, not just in flashes;

00:10:35.700 --> 00:10:38.939
they'll be infuriated throughout
the entire course of the interview.

00:10:38.963 --> 00:10:40.376
And if you ask someone honest

00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:42.976
what should happen
to whomever did forge those checks,

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:44.776
an honest person is much more likely

00:10:44.800 --> 00:10:47.976
to recommend strict rather
than lenient punishment.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.667
Now let's say you're having
that exact same conversation

00:10:50.691 --> 00:10:51.976
with someone deceptive.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:53.976
That person may be withdrawn,

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:55.976
look down, lower their voice,

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:57.976
pause, be kind of herky-jerky.

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.048
Ask a deceptive person
to tell their story,

00:11:00.072 --> 00:11:02.976
they're going to pepper it
with way too much detail

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:05.976
in all kinds of irrelevant places.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:09.476
And then they're going to tell their story
in strict chronological order.

00:11:09.500 --> 00:11:11.276
And what a trained interrogator does

00:11:11.300 --> 00:11:14.976
is they come in and in very subtle ways
over the course of several hours,

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.976
they will ask that person
to tell that story backwards,

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:19.976
and then they'll watch them squirm,

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:23.429
and track which questions produce
the highest volume of deceptive tells.

00:11:23.453 --> 00:11:25.976
Why do they do that?
Well, we all do the same thing.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:27.976
We rehearse our words,

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:29.976
but we rarely rehearse our gestures.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:31.976
We say "yes," we shake our heads "no."

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:35.096
We tell very convincing stories,
we slightly shrug our shoulders.

00:11:35.120 --> 00:11:36.976
We commit terrible crimes,

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.976
and we smile at the delight
in getting away with it.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:42.976
Now, that smile is known
in the trade as "duping delight."

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.976
And we're going to see that
in several videos moving forward,

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:49.076
but we're going to start --
for those of you who don't know him,

00:11:49.100 --> 00:11:51.176
this is presidential
candidate John Edwards

00:11:51.200 --> 00:11:53.976
who shocked America by fathering
a child out of wedlock.

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.976
We're going to see him talk
about getting a paternity test.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:01.000
See now if you can spot him
saying, "yes" while shaking his head "no,"

00:12:01.024 --> 00:12:02.976
slightly shrugging his shoulders.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:05.676
(Video) John Edwards: I'd be happy
to participate in one.

00:12:05.700 --> 00:12:08.576
I know that it's not possible
that this child could be mine,

00:12:08.600 --> 00:12:10.176
because of the timing of events.

00:12:10.200 --> 00:12:11.976
So I know it's not possible.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:15.976
Happy to take a paternity test,
and would love to see it happen.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:19.048
Interviewer: Are you going to do
that soon? Is there somebody --

00:12:19.072 --> 00:12:21.976
JE: Well, I'm only one side.
I'm only one side of the test.

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:24.604
But I'm happy to participate in one.

00:12:25.795 --> 00:12:28.229
PM: Okay, those head shakes
are much easier to spot

00:12:28.253 --> 00:12:29.776
once you know to look for them.

00:12:29.800 --> 00:12:33.776
There are going to be times
when someone makes one expression

00:12:33.800 --> 00:12:36.976
while masking another that just
kind of leaks through in a flash.

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:38.976
Murderers are known to leak sadness.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:41.576
Your new joint venture partner
might shake your hand,

00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:45.976
celebrate, go out to dinner with you
and then leak an expression of anger.

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:49.576
And we're not all going to become
facial expression experts overnight here,

00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:52.078
but there's one I can teach you
that's very dangerous

00:12:52.102 --> 00:12:53.315
and it's easy to learn,

00:12:53.339 --> 00:12:55.176
and that's the expression of contempt.

00:12:55.200 --> 00:12:58.200
Now with anger, you've got
two people on an even playing field.

00:12:58.224 --> 00:13:00.415
It's still somewhat
of a healthy relationship.

00:13:00.439 --> 00:13:03.976
But when anger turns to contempt,
you've been dismissed.

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:05.976
It's associated with moral superiority.

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.976
And for that reason, it's very,
very hard to recover from.

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:10.976
Here's what it looks like.

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:14.976
It's marked by one lip corner
pulled up and in.

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:17.976
It's the only asymmetrical expression.

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:21.976
And in the presence of contempt,
whether or not deception follows --

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:23.976
and it doesn't always follow --

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.048
look the other way,
go the other direction,

00:13:26.072 --> 00:13:27.976
reconsider the deal,

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:31.976
say, "No thank you. I'm not coming up
for just one more nightcap. Thank you."

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:35.976
Science has surfaced
many, many more indicators.

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:37.976
We know, for example,

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.000
we know liars will shift their blink rate,

00:13:40.024 --> 00:13:41.976
point their feet towards an exit.

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:43.976
They will take barrier objects

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:47.429
and put them between themselves
and the person that is interviewing them.

00:13:47.453 --> 00:13:48.976
They'll alter their vocal tone,

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:51.976
often making their vocal tone much lower.

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:53.976
Now here's the deal.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.976
These behaviors are just behaviors.

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:58.976
They're not proof of deception.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:00.976
They're red flags.

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:02.976
We're human beings.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:06.276
We make deceptive flailing gestures
all over the place all day long.

00:14:06.300 --> 00:14:08.491
They don't mean anything
in and of themselves.

00:14:08.515 --> 00:14:11.076
But when you see clusters
of them, that's your signal.

00:14:11.100 --> 00:14:13.976
Look, listen, probe,
ask some hard questions,

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.976
get out of that very comfortable
mode of knowing,

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:19.976
walk into curiosity mode,
ask more questions,

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:23.376
have a little dignity, treat the person
you're talking to with rapport.

00:14:23.400 --> 00:14:26.976
Don't try to be like those folks
on "Law &amp; Order" and those other TV shows

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:29.048
that pummel their subjects
into submission.

00:14:29.072 --> 00:14:31.076
Don't be too aggressive, it doesn't work.

00:14:32.119 --> 00:14:35.476
Now, we've talked a little bit
about how to talk to someone who's lying

00:14:35.500 --> 00:14:36.976
and how to spot a lie.

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:40.476
And as I promised, we're now going
to look at what the truth looks like.

00:14:40.500 --> 00:14:42.276
But I'm going to show you two videos,

00:14:42.300 --> 00:14:44.976
two mothers -- one is lying,
one is telling the truth.

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:49.096
And these were surfaced by researcher
David Matsumoto in California.

00:14:49.120 --> 00:14:52.976
And I think they're an excellent example
of what the truth looks like.

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:54.976
This mother, Diane Downs,

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:56.976
shot her kids at close range,

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:00.976
drove them to the hospital
while they bled all over the car,

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:02.976
claimed a scraggy-haired stranger did it.

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:04.976
And you'll see when you see the video,

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:07.334
she can't even pretend
to be an agonizing mother.

00:15:07.358 --> 00:15:10.976
What you want to look for here
is an incredible discrepancy

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:14.976
between horrific events that she describes
and her very, very cool demeanor.

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:18.476
And if you look closely, you'll see
duping delight throughout this video.

00:15:18.500 --> 00:15:20.976
(Video) Diane Downs:
At night when I close my eyes,

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:24.096
I can see Christie reaching
her hand out to me while I'm driving,

00:15:24.120 --> 00:15:26.376
and the blood just kept
coming out of her mouth.

00:15:26.400 --> 00:15:28.543
And that -- maybe
it'll fade too with time --

00:15:28.567 --> 00:15:29.976
but I don't think so.

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:33.000
That bothers me the most.

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:41.976
PM: Now I'm going to show you a video

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:44.048
of an actual grieving mother,
Erin Runnion,

00:15:44.072 --> 00:15:47.976
confronting her daughter's murderer
and torturer in court.

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:50.000
Here you're going to see no false emotion,

00:15:50.024 --> 00:15:52.976
just the authentic expression
of a mother's agony.

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:55.091
(Video) Erin Runnion:
I wrote this statement

00:15:55.115 --> 00:15:57.776
on the third anniversary
of the night you took my baby,

00:15:57.800 --> 00:15:59.076
and you hurt her,

00:15:59.100 --> 00:16:00.976
and you crushed her,

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:04.976
you terrified her until her heart stopped.

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:07.976
And she fought, and I know she fought you.

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:11.976
But I know she looked at you
with those amazing brown eyes,

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:14.976
and you still wanted to kill her.

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:16.976
And I don't understand it,

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:18.547
and I never will.

00:16:20.650 --> 00:16:23.976
PM: Okay, there's no doubting
the veracity of those emotions.

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:26.976
Now the technology
around what the truth looks like

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:29.976
is progressing on, the science of it.

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:31.976
We know, for example,

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:35.143
that we now have specialized eye trackers
and infrared brain scans,

00:16:35.167 --> 00:16:37.976
MRI's that can decode the signals
that our bodies send out

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:39.976
when we're trying to be deceptive.

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:42.976
And these technologies are going
to be marketed to all of us

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:44.976
as panaceas for deceit,

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:47.976
and they will prove
incredibly useful some day.

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:50.239
But you've got to ask yourself
in the meantime:

00:16:50.263 --> 00:16:52.359
Who do you want on your side
of the meeting,

00:16:52.383 --> 00:16:54.976
someone who's trained
in getting to the truth

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:58.076
or some guy who's going to drag
a 400-pound electroencephalogram

00:16:58.100 --> 00:16:59.376
through the door?

00:16:59.400 --> 00:17:02.976
Liespotters rely on human tools.

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:04.976
They know, as someone once said,

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:06.976
"Character's who you are in the dark."

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:10.976
And what's kind of interesting
is that today, we have so little darkness.

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:13.976
Our world is lit up 24 hours a day.

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:17.976
It's transparent
with blogs and social networks

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:20.676
broadcasting the buzz
of a whole new generation of people

00:17:20.700 --> 00:17:23.276
that have made a choice to live
their lives in public.

00:17:23.300 --> 00:17:26.976
It's a much more noisy world.

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:30.976
So one challenge we have is to remember,

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:33.976
oversharing, that's not honesty.

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:37.976
Our manic tweeting and texting
can blind us

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:41.576
to the fact that the subtleties
of human decency -- character integrity --

00:17:41.600 --> 00:17:44.648
that's still what matters,
that's always what's going to matter.

00:17:44.672 --> 00:17:46.176
So in this much noisier world,

00:17:46.200 --> 00:17:47.976
it might make sense for us

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:52.976
to be just a little bit more explicit
about our moral code.

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:55.576
When you combine the science
of recognizing deception

00:17:55.600 --> 00:17:57.276
with the art of looking, listening,

00:17:57.300 --> 00:17:59.976
you exempt yourself
from collaborating in a lie.

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:03.976
You start up that path
of being just a little bit more explicit,

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:06.000
because you signal to everyone around you,

00:18:06.024 --> 00:18:10.976
you say, "Hey, my world, our world,
it's going to be an honest one.

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:13.620
My world is going to be
one where truth is strengthened

00:18:13.644 --> 00:18:15.976
and falsehood is recognized
and marginalized."

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:17.976
And when you do that,

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:20.976
the ground around you starts
to shift just a little bit.

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:23.976
And that's the truth. Thank you.

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:29.000
(Applause)
