00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
So I'm here to explain

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
why I'm wearing these ninja pajamas.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
And to do that, I'd like to talk first

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
about environmental toxins in our bodies.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
So some of you may know

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
about the chemical Bisphenol A, BPA.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
It's a material hardener and synthetic estrogen

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
that's found in the lining of canned foods

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
and some plastics.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
So BPA mimics the body's own hormones

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
and causes neurological and reproductive problems.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
And it's everywhere.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
A recent study found BPA

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
in 93 percent of people six and older.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
But it's just one chemical.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
The Center for Disease Control in the U.S.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
says we have 219 toxic pollutants in our bodies,

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
and this includes preservatives, pesticides

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
and heavy metals like lead and mercury.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
To me, this says three things.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000
First, don't become a cannibal.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
Second, we are both responsible for and the victims of

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
our own pollution.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
And third,

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
our bodies are filters and storehouses

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
for environmental toxins.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
So what happens to all these toxins when we die?

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
The short answer is:

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
They return to the environment in one way or another,

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
continuing the cycle of toxicity.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
But our current funeral practices

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
make the situation much worse.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
If you're cremated,

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
all those toxins I mentioned are released into the atmosphere.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
And this includes 5,000 pounds of mercury

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
from our dental fillings alone every year.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
And in a traditional American funeral,

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
a dead body is covered with fillers and cosmetics

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
to make it look alive.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
It's then pumped with toxic formaldehyde

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
to slow decomposition --

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
a practice which causes respiratory problems and cancer

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
in funeral personnel.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
So by trying to preserve our dead bodies,

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
we deny death, poison the living

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
and further harm the environment.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
Green or natural burials, which don't use embalming,

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
are a step in the right direction,

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.000
but they don't address the existing toxins in our bodies.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
I think there's a better solution.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
I'm an artist,

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
so I'd like to offer a modest proposal

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
at the intersection

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
of art, science and culture.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
The Infinity Burial Project,

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
an alternative burial system

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
that uses mushrooms

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
to decompose and clean toxins in bodies.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
The Infinity Burial Project

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
began a few years ago with a fantasy

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
to create the Infinity Mushroom --

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
a new hybrid mushroom

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
that would decompose bodies, clean the toxins

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
and deliver nutrients to plant roots,

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000
leaving clean compost.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
But I learned it's nearly impossible

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
to create a new hybrid mushroom.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
I also learned

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
that some of our tastiest mushrooms

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
can clean environmental toxins in soil.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000
So I thought maybe I could train an army

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000
of toxin-cleaning edible mushrooms

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
to eat my body.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000
So today, I'm collecting what I shed or slough off --

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000
my hair, skin and nails --

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000
and I'm feeding these to edible mushrooms.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
As the mushrooms grow,

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
I pick the best feeders

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000
to become Infinity Mushrooms.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000
It's a kind of imprinting and selective breeding process

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000
for the afterlife.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000
So when I die,

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000
the Infinity Mushrooms will recognize my body

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
and be able to eat it.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
All right, so for some of you,

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
this may be really, really out there.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
(Laughter)

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
Just a little.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000
I realize this is not the kind of relationship

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000
that we usually aspire to have with our food.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.000
We want to eat, not be eaten by, our food.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000
But as I watch the mushrooms grow

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000
and digest my body,

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000
I imagine the Infinity Mushroom

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.000
as a symbol of a new way of thinking about death

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.000
and the relationship between my body and the environment.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000
See for me,

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000
cultivating the Infinity Mushroom

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
is more than just scientific experimentation

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.000
or gardening or raising a pet,

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000
it's a step towards accepting the fact

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.000
that someday I will die and decay.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000
It's also a step

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000
towards taking responsibility

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.000
for my own burden on the planet.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000
Growing a mushroom is also part of a larger practice

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000
of cultivating decomposing organisms

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000
called decompiculture,

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.000
a concept that was developed by an entomologist,

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.000
Timothy Myles.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.000
The Infinity Mushroom is a subset of decompiculture

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.000
I'm calling body decompiculture and toxin remediation --

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000
the cultivation of organisms that decompose

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.000
and clean toxins in bodies.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000
And now about these ninja pajamas.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000
Once it's completed,

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.000
I plan to integrate the Infinity Mushrooms into a number of objects.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000
First, a burial suit

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000
infused with mushroom spores,

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000
the Mushroom Death Suit.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
(Laughter)

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000
I'm wearing the second prototype

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000
of this burial suit.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.000
It's covered with a crocheted netting

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000
that is embedded with mushroom spores.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000
The dendritic pattern you see

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000
mimics the growth of mushroom mycelia,

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000
which are the equivalent of plant roots.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000
I'm also making a decompiculture kit,

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000
a cocktail of capsules

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000
that contain Infinity Mushroom spores

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000
and other elements

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.000
that speed decomposition and toxin remediation.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.000
These capsules are embedded in a nutrient-rich jelly,

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000
a kind of second skin,

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000
which dissolves quickly

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.000
and becomes baby food for the growing mushrooms.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.000
So I plan to finish the mushroom and decompiculture kit

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.000
in the next year or two,

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.000
and then I'd like to begin testing them,

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000
first with expired meat from the market

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000
and then with human subjects.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000
And believe it or not,

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.000
a few people have offered to donate their bodies to the project

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.000
to be eaten by mushrooms.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.000
(Laughter)

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.000
What I've learned from talking to these folks

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000
is that we share a common desire

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.000
to understand and accept death

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.000
and to minimize the impact of our death on the environment.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.000
I wanted to cultivate this perspective

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000
just like the mushrooms,

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.000
so I formed the Decompiculture Society,

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.000
a group of people called decompinauts

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.000
who actively explore their postmortem options,

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000
seek death acceptance

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.000
and cultivate decomposing organisms

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.000
like the Infinity Mushroom.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000
The Decompiculture Society shares a vision

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000
of a cultural shift,

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.000
from our current culture of death denial and body preservation

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000
to one of decompiculture,

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:35.000
a radical acceptance of death and decomposition.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.000
Accepting death means accepting

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000
that we are physical beings

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.000
who are intimately connected to the environment,

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.000
as the research on environmental toxins confirms.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.000
And the saying goes,

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:49.000
we came from dust and will return to dust.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:52.000
And once we understand that we're connected to the environment,

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000
we see that the survival of our species

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000
depends on the survival of the planet.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.000
I believe this is the beginning

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000
of true environmental responsibility.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.000
Thank you.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:09.000
(Applause)
