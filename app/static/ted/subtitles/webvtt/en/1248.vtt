WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
I'd like to take you to another world.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
And I'd like to share

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
a 45 year-old love story

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
with the poor,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
living on less than one dollar a day.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
I went to a very elitist, snobbish,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
expensive education in India,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
and that almost destroyed me.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
I was all set

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
to be a diplomat, teacher, doctor --

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
all laid out.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
Then, I don't look it, but I was the Indian national squash champion

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
for three years.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
(Laughter)

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
The whole world was laid out for me.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
Everything was at my feet.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
I could do nothing wrong.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
And then I thought out of curiosity

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
I'd like to go and live and work

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
and just see what a village is like.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
So in 1965,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000
I went to what was called the worst Bihar famine in India,

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
and I saw starvation, death,

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
people dying of hunger, for the first time.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
It changed my life.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
I came back home,

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
told my mother,

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
"I'd like to live and work in a village."

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
Mother went into a coma.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
(Laughter)

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
"What is this?

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
The whole world is laid out for you, the best jobs are laid out for you,

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
and you want to go and work in a village?

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
I mean, is there something wrong with you?"

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
I said, "No, I've got the best eduction.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
It made me think.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
And I wanted to give something back

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
in my own way."

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
"What do you want to do in a village?

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
No job, no money,

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
no security, no prospect."

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
I said, "I want to live

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
and dig wells for five years."

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
"Dig wells for five years?

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
You went to the most expensive school and college in India,

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
and you want to dig wells for five years?"

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000
She didn't speak to me for a very long time,

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000
because she thought I'd let my family down.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
But then,

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
I was exposed to the most extraordinary knowledge and skills

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
that very poor people have,

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000
which are never brought into the mainstream --

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
which is never identified, respected,

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
applied on a large scale.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
And I thought I'd start a Barefoot College --

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
college only for the poor.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
What the poor thought was important

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
would be reflected in the college.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
I went to this village for the first time.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
Elders came to me

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
and said, "Are you running from the police?"

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
I said, "No."

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000
(Laughter)

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
"You failed in your exam?"

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
I said, "No."

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000
"You didn't get a government job?" I said, "No."

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
"What are you doing here?

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
Why are you here?

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
The education system in India

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000
makes you look at Paris and New Delhi and Zurich;

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000
what are you doing in this village?

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000
Is there something wrong with you you're not telling us?"

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000
I said, "No, I want to actually start a college

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
only for the poor.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000
What the poor thought was important would be reflected in the college."

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.000
So the elders gave me some very sound and profound advice.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
They said, "Please,

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000
don't bring anyone with a degree and qualification

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000
into your college."

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.000
So it's the only college in India

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000
where, if you should have a Ph.D. or a Master's,

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000
you are disqualified to come.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:42.000
You have to be a cop-out or a wash-out or a dropout

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000
to come to our college.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000
You have to work with your hands.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000
You have to have a dignity of labor.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.000
You have to show that you have a skill that you can offer to the community

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.000
and provide a service to the community.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.000
So we started the Barefoot College,

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000
and we redefined professionalism.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
Who is a professional?

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000
A professional is someone

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000
who has a combination of competence,

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000
confidence and belief.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000
A water diviner is a professional.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000
A traditional midwife

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000
is a professional.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.000
A traditional bone setter is a professional.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000
These are professionals all over the world.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:25.000
You find them in any inaccessible village around the world.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.000
And we thought that these people should come into the mainstream

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000
and show that the knowledge and skills that they have

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000
is universal.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000
It needs to be used, needs to be applied,

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000
needs to be shown to the world outside --

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000
that these knowledge and skills

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:43.000
are relevant even today.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000
So the college works

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:49.000
following the lifestyle and workstyle of Mahatma Gandhi.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:53.000
You eat on the floor, you sleep on the floor, you work on the floor.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000
There are no contracts, no written contracts.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.000
You can stay with me for 20 years, go tomorrow.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.000
And no one can get more than $100 a month.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.000
You come for the money, you don't come to Barefoot College.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000
You come for the work and the challenge,

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000
you'll come to the Barefoot College.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.000
That is where we want you to try crazy ideas.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000
Whatever idea you have, come and try it.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000
It doesn't matter if you fail.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000
Battered, bruised, you start again.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.000
It's the only college where the teacher is the learner

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.000
and the learner is the teacher.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.000
And it's the only college where we don't give a certificate.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000
You are certified by the community you serve.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000
You don't need a paper to hang on the wall

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.000
to show that you are an engineer.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000
So when I said that,

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.000
they said, "Well show us what is possible. What are you doing?

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:46.000
This is all mumbo-jumbo if you can't show it on the ground."

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.000
So we built the first Barefoot College

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.000
in 1986.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.000
It was built by 12 Barefoot architects

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000
who can't read and write,

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.000
built on $1.50 a sq. ft.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:03.000
150 people lived there, worked there.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.000
They got the Aga Khan Award for Architecture in 2002.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.000
But then they suspected, they thought there was an architect behind it.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.000
I said, "Yes, they made the blueprints,

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:15.000
but the Barefoot architects actually constructed the college."

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.000
We are the only ones who actually returned the award for $50,000,

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.000
because they didn't believe us,

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:25.000
and we thought that they were actually casting aspersions

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:28.000
on the Barefoot architects of Tilonia.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000
I asked a forester --

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.000
high-powered, paper-qualified expert --

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.000
I said, "What can you build in this place?"

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.000
He had one look at the soil and said, "Forget it. No way.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.000
Not even worth it.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000
No water, rocky soil."

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000
I was in a bit of a spot.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.000
And I said, "Okay, I'll go to the old man in village

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:49.000
and say, 'What should I grow in this spot?'"

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000
He looked quietly at me and said,

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000
"You build this, you build this, you put this, and it'll work."

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.000
This is what it looks like today.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.000
Went to the roof,

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000
and all the women said, "Clear out.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:04.000
The men should clear out because we don't want to share this technology with the men.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.000
This is waterproofing the roof."

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.000
(Laughter)

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:11.000
It is a bit of jaggery, a bit of urens

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.000
and a bit of other things I don't know.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000
But it actually doesn't leak.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.000
Since 1986, it hasn't leaked.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.000
This technology, the women will not share with the men.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.000
(Laughter)

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.000
It's the only college

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:30.000
which is fully solar-electrified.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000
All the power comes from the sun.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.000
45 kilowatts of panels on the roof.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000
And everything works off the sun for the next 25 years.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.000
So long as the sun shines,

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.000
we'll have no problem with power.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.000
But the beauty is

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:45.000
that is was installed

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.000
by a priest, a Hindu priest,

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:51.000
who's only done eight years of primary schooling --

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:54.000
never been to school, never been to college.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.000
He knows more about solar

00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:00.000
than anyone I know anywhere in the world guaranteed.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000
Food, if you come to the Barefoot College,

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:07.000
is solar cooked.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:10.000
But the people who fabricated that solar cooker

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:13.000
are women,

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.000
illiterate women,

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.000
who actually fabricate

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.000
the most sophisticated solar cooker.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:22.000
It's a parabolic Scheffler solar cooker.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:29.000
Unfortunately, they're almost half German,

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000
they're so precise.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.000
(Laughter)

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.000
You'll never find Indian women so precise.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.000
Absolutely to the last inch,

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.000
they can make that cooker.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.000
And we have 60 meals twice a day

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.000
of solar cooking.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.000
We have a dentist --

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:50.000
she's a grandmother, illiterate, who's a dentist.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.000
She actually looks after the teeth

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:55.000
of 7,000 children.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.000
Barefoot technology:

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:01.000
this was 1986 -- no engineer, no architect thought of it --

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:04.000
but we are collecting rainwater from the roofs.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.000
Very little water is wasted.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.000
All the roofs are connected underground

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.000
to a 400,000 liter tank,

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.000
and no water is wasted.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.000
If we have four years of drought, we still have water on the campus,

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.000
because we collect rainwater.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:20.000
60 percent of children don't go to school,

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.000
because they have to look after animals --

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.000
sheep, goats --

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.000
domestic chores.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:29.000
So we thought of starting a school

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.000
at night for the children.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.000
Because the night schools of Tilonia,

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:36.000
over 75,000 children have gone through these night schools.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.000
Because it's for the convenience of the child;

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.000
it's not for the convenience of the teacher.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.000
And what do we teach in these schools?

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:44.000
Democracy, citizenship,

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:47.000
how you should measure your land,

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.000
what you should do if you're arrested,

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:53.000
what you should do if your animal is sick.

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.000
This is what we teach in the night schools.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:58.000
But all the schools are solar-lit.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.000
Every five years

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.000
we have an election.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:06.000
Between six to 14 year-old children

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:09.000
participate in a democratic process,

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:13.000
and they elect a prime minister.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:16.000
The prime minister is 12 years old.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.000
She looks after 20 goats in the morning,

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:22.000
but she's prime minister in the evening.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.000
She has a cabinet,

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:27.000
a minister of education, a minister for energy, a minister for health.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.000
And they actually monitor and supervise

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:32.000
150 schools for 7,000 children.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.000
She got the World's Children's Prize five years ago,

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.000
and she went to Sweden.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.000
First time ever going out of her village.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:43.000
Never seen Sweden.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.000
Wasn't dazzled at all by what was happening.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.000
And the Queen of Sweden, who's there,

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:50.000
turned to me and said, "Can you ask this child where she got her confidence from?

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.000
She's only 12 years old,

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:55.000
and she's not dazzled by anything."

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:58.000
And the girl, who's on her left,

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:01.000
turned to me and looked at the queen straight in the eye

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:04.000
and said, "Please tell her I'm the prime minister."

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:06.000
(Laughter)

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:14.000
(Applause)

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:18.000
Where the percentage of illiteracy is very high,

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:21.000
we use puppetry.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:24.000
Puppets is the way we communicate.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:33.000
You have Jokhim Chacha

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:37.000
who is 300 years old.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:40.000
He is my psychoanalyst. He is my teacher.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:42.000
He's my doctor. He's my lawyer.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:44.000
He's my donor.

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:46.000
He actually raises money,

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:49.000
solves my disputes.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:52.000
He solves my problems in the village.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.000
If there's tension in the village,

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.000
if attendance at the schools goes down

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.000
and there's a friction between the teacher and the parent,

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:01.000
the puppet calls the teacher and the parent in front of the whole village

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.000
and says, "Shake hands.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:05.000
The attendance must not drop."

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:09.000
These puppets

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:11.000
are made out of recycled World Bank reports.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.000
(Laughter)

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:20.000
(Applause)

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:24.000
So this decentralized, demystified approach

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:26.000
of solar-electrifying villages,

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.000
we've covered all over India

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:31.000
from Ladakh up to Bhutan --

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:35.000
all solar-electrified villages

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:38.000
by people who have been trained.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:41.000
And we went to Ladakh,

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.000
and we asked this woman --

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:46.000
this, at minus 40, you have to come out of the roof,

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:49.000
because there's no place, it was all snowed up on both sides --

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:51.000
and we asked this woman,

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.000
"What was the benefit you had

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.000
from solar electricity?"

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.000
And she thought for a minute and said,

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:01.000
"It's the first time I can see my husband's face in winter."

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:04.000
(Laughter)

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:06.000
Went to Afghanistan.

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:11.000
One lesson we learned in India

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:15.000
was men are untrainable.

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:19.000
(Laughter)

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:21.000
Men are restless,

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.000
men are ambitious,

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:26.000
men are compulsively mobile,

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:28.000
and they all want a certificate.

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.000
(Laughter)

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:33.000
All across the globe, you have this tendency

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:35.000
of men wanting a certificate.

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:38.000
Why? Because they want to leave the village

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:41.000
and go to a city, looking for a job.

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:44.000
So we came up with a great solution:

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:46.000
train grandmothers.

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.000
What's the best way of communicating

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.000
in the world today?

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:54.000
Television? No.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.000
Telegraph? No.

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:58.000
Telephone? No.

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:00.000
Tell a woman.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:03.000
(Laughter)

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:07.000
(Applause)

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:09.000
So we went to Afghanistan for the first time,

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:11.000
and we picked three women

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:13.000
and said, "We want to take them to India."

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:15.000
They said, "Impossible. They don't even go out of their rooms,

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:17.000
and you want to take them to India."

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:19.000
I said, "I'll make a concession. I'll take the husbands along as well."

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:21.000
So I took the husbands along.

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:24.000
Of course, the women were much more intelligent than the men.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.000
In six months,

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:29.000
how do we train these women?

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:31.000
Sign language.

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:34.000
You don't choose the written word.

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:36.000
You don't choose the spoken word.

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:39.000
You use sign language.

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:41.000
And in six months

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:45.000
they can become solar engineers.

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:48.000
They go back and solar-electrify their own village.

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:50.000
This woman went back

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:53.000
and solar-electrified the first village,

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:55.000
set up a workshop --

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:58.000
the first village ever to be solar-electrified in Afghanistan

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:01.000
[was] by the three women.

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.000
This woman

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:05.000
is an extraordinary grandmother.

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:10.000
55 years old, and she's solar-electrified 200 houses for me in Afghanistan.

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:13.000
And they haven't collapsed.

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:16.000
She actually went and spoke to an engineering department in Afghanistan

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:18.000
and told the head of the department

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.000
the difference between AC and DC.

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:22.000
He didn't know.

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:25.000
Those three women have trained 27 more women

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:28.000
and solar-electrified 100 villages in Afghanistan.

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:31.000
We went to Africa,

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:33.000
and we did the same thing.

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:36.000
All these women sitting at one table from eight, nine countries,

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:39.000
all chatting to each other, not understanding a word,

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:41.000
because they're all speaking a different language.

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:43.000
But their body language is great.

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:45.000
They're speaking to each other

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:47.000
and actually becoming solar engineers.

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:50.000
I went to Sierra Leone,

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:53.000
and there was this minister driving down in the dead of night --

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:55.000
comes across this village.

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:58.000
Comes back, goes into the village, says, "Well what's the story?"

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:00.000
They said, "These two grandmothers ... "

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:03.000
"Grandmothers?" The minister couldn't believe what was happening.

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:06.000
"Where did they go?" "Went to India and back."

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:08.000
Went straight to the president.

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:10.000
He said, "Do you know there's a solar-electrified village in Sierra Leone?"

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:13.000
He said, "No." Half the cabinet went to see the grandmothers the next day.

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:15.000
"What's the story."

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:19.000
So he summoned me and said, "Can you train me 150 grandmothers?"

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:21.000
I said, "I can't, Mr. President.

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:23.000
But they will. The grandmothers will."

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:26.000
So he built me the first Barefoot training center in Sierra Leone.

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:30.000
And 150 grandmothers have been trained in Sierra Leone.

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:32.000
Gambia:

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:35.000
we went to select a grandmother in Gambia.

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:37.000
Went to this village.

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:39.000
I knew which woman I would like to take.

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:42.000
The community got together and said, "Take these two women."

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:44.000
I said, "No, I want to take this woman."

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:46.000
They said, "Why? She doesn't know the language. You don't know her."

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:49.000
I said, "I like the body language. I like the way she speaks."

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:51.000
"Difficult husband; not possible."

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:53.000
Called the husband, the husband came,

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:56.000
swaggering, politician, mobile in his hand. "Not possible."

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:59.000
"Why not?" "The woman, look how beautiful she is."

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:01.000
I said, "Yeah, she is very beautiful."

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:03.000
"What happens if she runs off with an Indian man?"

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:05.000
That was his biggest fear.

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:08.000
I said, "She'll be happy. She'll ring you up on the mobile."

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:11.000
She went like a grandmother

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:13.000
and came back like a tiger.

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:15.000
She walked out of the plane

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:18.000
and spoke to the whole press as if she was a veteran.

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:21.000
She handled the national press,

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:23.000
and she was a star.

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:26.000
And when I went back six months later, I said, "Where's your husband?"

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:28.000
"Oh, somewhere. It doesn't matter."

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:30.000
(Laughter)

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:32.000
Success story.

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:34.000
(Laughter)

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:37.000
(Applause)

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:43.000
I'll just wind up by saying

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:47.000
that I think you don't have to look for solutions outside.

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:49.000
Look for solutions within.

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:52.000
And listen to people. They have the solutions in front of you.

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:54.000
They're all over the world.

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:56.000
Don't even worry.

00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:59.000
Don't listen to the World Bank, listen to the people on the ground.

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:02.000
They have all the solutions in the world.

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:05.000
I'll end with a quotation by Mahatma Gandhi.

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:07.000
"First they ignore you,

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:09.000
then they laugh at you,

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:11.000
then they fight you,

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:13.000
and then you win."

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:15.000
Thank you.

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:46.000
(Applause)
