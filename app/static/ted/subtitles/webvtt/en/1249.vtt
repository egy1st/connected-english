00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Why can't we solve these problems?

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
We know what they are.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Something always seems to stop us.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Why?

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
I remember March the 15th, 2000.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
The B15 iceberg broke off the Ross Ice Shelf.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
In the newspaper it said

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
"it was all part of a normal process."

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
A little bit further on in the article

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
it said "a loss that would normally take

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.000
the ice shelf 50-100 years to replace."

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
That same word, "normal,"

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
had two different,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
almost opposite meanings.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
If we walk into the B15 iceberg

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
when we leave here today,

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
we're going to bump into something

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
a thousand feet tall,

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.000
76 miles long,

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
17 miles wide,

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
and it's going to weigh two gigatons.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
I'm sorry, there's nothing normal about this.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
And yet I think it's this perspective of us

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
as humans to look at our world

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
through the lens of normal

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
is one of the forces

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.000
that stops us developing real solutions.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
Only 90 days after this,

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
arguably the greatest discovery

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
of the last century occurred.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
It was the sequencing for the first time

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
of the human genome.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.000
This is the code that's in every single one

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
of our 50 trillion cells

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.000
that makes us who we are and what we are.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
And if we just take one cell's worth

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
of this code and unwind it,

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000
it's a meter long,

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
two nanometers thick.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.000
Two nanometers is 20 atoms in thickness.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
And I wondered,

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
what if the answer to some of our biggest problems

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
could be found in the smallest of places,

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
where the difference between what is

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
valuable and what is worthless

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
is merely the addition or subtraction

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
of a few atoms?

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
And what

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000
if we could get exquisite control

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
over the essence of energy,

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
the electron?

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
So I started to go around the world

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000
finding the best and brightest scientists

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
I could at universities

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
whose collective discoveries have the chance

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
to take us there,

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
and we formed a company to build

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
on their extraordinary ideas.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000
Six and a half years later,

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
a hundred and eighty researchers,

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
they have some amazing developments

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
in the lab,

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
and I will show you three of those today,

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
such that we can stop burning up our planet

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000
and instead,

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000
we can generate all the energy we need

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
right where we are,

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000
cleanly, safely, and cheaply.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
Think of the space that we spend

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
most of our time.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
A tremendous amount of energy

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
is coming at us from the sun.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000
We like the light that comes into the room,

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000
but in the middle of summer,

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
all that heat is coming into the room

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000
that we're trying to keep cool.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
In winter, exactly the opposite is happening.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:32.000
We're trying to heat up

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000
the space that we're in,

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000
and all that is trying to get out through the window.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000
Wouldn't it be really great

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000
if the window could flick back the heat

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000
into the room if we needed it

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000
or flick it away before it came in?

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000
One of the materials that can do this

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:53.000
is a remarkable material, carbon,

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.000
that has changed its form in this incredibly beautiful reaction

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.000
where graphite is blasted by a vapor,

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:05.000
and when the vaporized carbon condenses,

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.000
it condenses back into a different form:

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.000
chickenwire rolled up.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000
But this chickenwire carbon,

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000
called a carbon nanotube,

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000
is a hundred thousand times smaller

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.000
than the width of one of your hairs.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000
It's a thousand times

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000
more conductive than copper.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.000
How is that possible?

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.000
One of the things about working at the nanoscale

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.000
is things look and act very differently.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.000
You think of carbon as black.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.000
Carbon at the nanoscale

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.000
is actually transparent

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.000
and flexible.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000
And when it's in this form,

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.000
if I combine it with a polymer

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.000
and affix it to your window

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.000
when it's in its colored state,

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.000
it will reflect away all heat and light,

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000
and when it's in its bleached state

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.000
it will let all the light and heat through

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.000
and any combination in between.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.000
To change its state, by the way,

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.000
takes two volts from a millisecond pulse.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.000
And once you've changed its state, it stays there

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.000
until you change its state again.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000
As we were working on this incredible

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000
discovery at University of Florida,

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.000
we were told to go down the corridor

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000
to visit another scientist,

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000
and he was working

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000
on a pretty incredible thing.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000
Imagine

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000
if we didn't have to rely

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:49.000
on artificial lighting to get around at night.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:55.000
We'd have to see at night, right?

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.000
This lets you do it.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.000
It's a nanomaterial, two nanomaterials,

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.000
a detector and an imager.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000
The total width of it

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.000
is 600 times smaller

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.000
than the width of a decimal place.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:16.000
And it takes all the infrared available at night,

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.000
converts it into an electron

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.000
in the space of two small films,

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.000
and is enabling you to play an image

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:28.000
which you can see through.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.000
I'm going to show to TEDsters,

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.000
the first time, this operating.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000
Firstly I'm going to show you

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.000
the transparency.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:46.000
Transparency is key.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:49.000
It's a film that you can look through.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:52.000
And then I'm going to turn the lights out.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:55.000
And you can see, off a tiny film,

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:59.000
incredible clarity.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:03.000
As we were working on this, it dawned on us:

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:07.000
this is taking infrared radiation, wavelengths,

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:10.000
and converting it into electrons.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:16.000
What if we combined it

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:19.000
with this?

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:22.000
Suddenly you've converted energy

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:26.000
into an electron on a plastic surface

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.000
that you can stick on your window.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000
But because it's flexible,

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:35.000
it can be on any surface whatsoever.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.000
The power plant of tomorrow

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:45.000
is no power plant.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.000
We talked about generating and using.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.000
We want to talk about storing energy,

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000
and unfortunately

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000
the best thing we've got going

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.000
is something that was developed in France

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.000
a hundred and fifty years ago,

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000
the lead acid battery.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000
In terms of dollars per what's stored,

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000
it's simply the best.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.000
Knowing that we're not going to put fifty of

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.000
these in our basements to store our power,

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.000
we went to a group at University of Texas at Dallas,

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000
and we gave them this diagram.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.000
It was in actually a diner

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.000
outside of Dallas/Fort Worth Airport.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.000
We said, "Could you build this?"

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.000
And these scientists,

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.000
instead of laughing at us, said, "Yeah."

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:25.000
And what they built was eBox.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.000
EBox is testing new nanomaterials

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:30.000
to park an electron on the outside,

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.000
hold it until you need it,

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.000
and then be able to release it and pass it off.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:40.000
Being able to do that means

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:43.000
that I can generate energy

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:46.000
cleanly, efficiently and cheaply

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.000
right where I am.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.000
It's my energy.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.000
And if I don't need it, I can convert it

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.000
back up on the window

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.000
to energy, light, and beam it,

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:00.000
line of site, to your place.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.000
And for that I do not need

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:06.000
an electric grid between us.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:10.000
The grid of tomorrow is no grid,

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:14.000
and energy, clean efficient energy,

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:17.000
will one day be free.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:25.000
If you do this, you get the last puzzle piece,

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:28.000
which is water.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:36.000
Each of us, every day,

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:41.000
need just eight glasses of this,

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:44.000
because we're human.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.000
When we run out of water,

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.000
as we are in some parts of the world

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.000
and soon to be in other parts of the world,

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:53.000
we're going to have to get this from the sea,

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:56.000
and that's going to require us to build desalination plants.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:59.000
19 trillion dollars is what we're going to have to spend.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.000
These also require tremendous amounts of energy.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.000
In fact, it's going to require twice the world's

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.000
supply of oil to run the pumps

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:08.000
to generate the water.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.000
We're simply not going to do that.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.000
But in a world where energy is freed

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.000
and transmittable

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.000
easily and cheaply, we can take any water

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.000
wherever we are

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:22.000
and turn it into whatever we need.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.000
I'm glad to be working with

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.000
incredibly brilliant and kind scientists,

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.000
no kinder than

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.000
many of the people in the world,

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:33.000
but they have a magic look at the world.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.000
And I'm glad to see their discoveries

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:38.000
coming out of the lab and into the world.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:42.000
It's been a long time in coming for me.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:45.000
18 years ago,

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:49.000
I saw a photograph in the paper.

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.000
It was taken by Kevin Carter

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:53.000
who went to the Sudan

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.000
to document their famine there.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.000
I've carried this photograph with me

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.000
every day since then.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:07.000
It's a picture of a little girl dying of thirst.

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:17.000
By any standard this is wrong.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:20.000
It's just wrong.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:26.000
We can do better than this.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:29.000
We should do better than this.

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.000
And whenever I go round

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:33.000
to somebody who says,

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.000
"You know what, you're working on something that's too difficult.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:38.000
It'll never happen. You don't have enough money.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:41.000
You don't have enough time.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:44.000
There's something much more interesting around the corner,"

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:46.000
I say, "Try saying that to her."

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.000
That's what I say in my mind. And I just say

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:51.000
"thank you," and I go on to the next one.

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:54.000
This is why we have to solve our problems,

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:59.000
and I know the answer as to how

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:03.000
is to be able to get exquisite control

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:06.000
over a building block of nature,

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.000
the stuff of life:

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.000
the simple electron.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.000
Thank you.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:24.000
(Applause)
