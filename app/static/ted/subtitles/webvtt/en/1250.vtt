00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.000
Good afternoon.

00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.000
If you have followed

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
diplomatic news in the past weeks,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
you may have heard of a kind of crisis

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
between China and the U.S.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
regarding cyberattacks

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
against the American company Google.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Many things have been said about this.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Some people have called a cyberwar

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
what may actually be

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
just a spy operation --

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
and obviously, a quite mishandled one.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
However, this episode reveals

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
the growing anxiety in the Western world

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
regarding these emerging cyber weapons.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
It so happens that these weapons are dangerous.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
They're of a new nature:

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
they could lead the world

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
into a digital conflict

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
that could turn into an armed struggle.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
These virtual weapons can also destroy the physical world.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
In 1982, in the middle of the Cold War

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
in Soviet Siberia,

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000
a pipeline exploded with a burst of 3 kilotons,

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
the equivalent of a fourth of the Hiroshima bomb.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
Now we know today -- this was revealed

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
by Thomas Reed,

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
Ronald Reagan's former U.S. Air Force Secretary --

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
this explosion was actually the result

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
of a CIA sabotage operation,

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
in which they had managed

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
to infiltrate the IT management systems

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
of that pipeline.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
More recently, the U.S. government revealed

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
that in September 2008, more than 3 million people

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
in the state of Espirito Santo in Brazil

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
were plunged into darkness,

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.000
victims of a blackmail operation from cyber pirates.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
Even more worrying for the Americans,

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000
in December 2008 the holiest of holies,

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
the IT systems of CENTCOM,

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
the central command

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
managing the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan,

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
may have been infiltrated by hackers

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
who used these:

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
plain but infected USB keys.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
And with these keys, they may have been able

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
to get inside CENTCOM's systems,

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
to see and hear everything,

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
and maybe even infect some of them.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
As a result, the Americans take the threat very seriously.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
I'll quote General James Cartwright,

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
who says in a report to Congress

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000
that cyberattacks could be as powerful as

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000
weapons of mass destruction.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
Moreover, the Americans have decided

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
to spend over 30 billion dollars

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.500
in the next five years

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:18.000
to build up their cyberwar capabilities.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
And across the world today, we see

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
a sort of cyber arms race,

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
with cyberwar units

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
built up by countries like North Korea

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.000
or even Iran.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
Yet, what you'll never hear

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
from spokespeople

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
from the Pentagon or the French Department of Defence

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
is that the question isn't really

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000
who's the enemy, but actually

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000
the very nature of cyber weapons.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
And to understand why, we must look at how,

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000
through the ages, military technologies

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
have maintained or destroyed

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000
world peace.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
For example,

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:56.000
if we'd had TEDxParis

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
350 years ago,

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000
we would have talked about the military innovation of the day --

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000
the massive Vauban-style fortifications --

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
and we could have predicted

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
a period of stability in the world or in Europe.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000
which was indeed the case in Europe

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
between 1650 and 1750.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000
Similarly, if we'd had this talk

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000
30 or 40 years ago, we would have seen

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000
how the rise of nuclear weapons,

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.000
and the threat of mutually assured destruction they imply,

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.000
prevents a direct fight between the two superpowers.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
However, if we'd had this talk 60 years ago,

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000
we would have seen how the emergence

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000
of new aircraft and tank technologies,

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.000
which give the advantage to the attacker,

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.000
make the Blitzkrieg doctrine very credible

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000
and thus create the possibility of war in Europe.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000
So military technologies

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000
can influence the course of the world,

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000
can make or break world peace --

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000
and there lies the issue with cyber weapons.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000
The first issue:

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
Imagine a potential enemy announcing

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
they're building a cyberwar unit,

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000
but only for their country's defense.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.000
Okay, but what distinguishes it

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000
from an offensive unit?

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000
It gets even more complicated

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:15.000
when the doctrines of use become ambiguous.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:19.000
Just 3 years ago, both the U.S. and France

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:23.000
were saying they were investing militarily in cyberspace,

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.000
strictly to defend their IT systems.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.000
But today both countries say

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000
the best defense is to attack.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000
And so, they're joining China,

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:37.000
whose doctrine of use for 15 years has been

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.000
both defensive and offensive.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000
The second issue:

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:46.000
Your country could be under cyberattack

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.000
with entire regions plunged into total darkness,

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000
and you may not even know

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000
who's attacking you.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:54.800
Cyber weapons have this peculiar feature:

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:56.300
they can be used

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:58.000
without leaving traces.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000
This gives a tremendous advantage to the attacker,

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000
because the defender

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000
doesn't know who to fight back against.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000
And if the defender retaliates against the wrong adversary,

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000
they risk making one more enemy

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000
and ending up diplomatically isolated.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000
This issue isn't just theoretical.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000
In May 2007, Estonia was the victim of cyberattacks,

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000
that damaged its communication

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000
and banking systems.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000
Estonia accused Russia.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000
But NATO, though it defends Estonia,

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000
reacted very prudently. Why?

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000
Because NATO couldn't be 100% sure

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:33.000
that the Kremlin was indeed behind these attacks.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.000
So to sum up, on the one hand,

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.000
when a possible enemy announces

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000
they're building a cyberwar unit,

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000
you don't know whether it's for attack

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:43.000
or defense.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:44.000
On the other hand,

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.000
we know that these weapons give an advantage to attacking.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.000
In a major article published in 1978,

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000
Professor Robert Jervis of Columbia University in New York

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.000
described a model to understand

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000
how conflicts could arise.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.000
In this context,

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000
when you don't know if the potential enemy

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.000
is preparing for defense or attack,

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000
and if the weapons give an advantage to attacking,

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.000
then this environment is

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:13.000
most likely to spark a conflict.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000
This is the environment that's being created

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000
by cyber weapons today,

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.000
and historically it was the environment in Europe

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:24.000
at the onset of World War I.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000
So cyber weapons

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000
are dangerous by nature,

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.000
but in addition, they're emerging

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.000
in a much more unstable environment.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.000
If you remember the Cold War,

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.000
it was a very hard game,

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000
but a stable one played only by two players,

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.000
which allowed for some coordination between the two superpowers.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:47.000
Today we're moving to a multipolar world

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:48.000
in which coordination is much more complicated,

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.000
as we have seen at Copenhagen.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.000
And this coordination may become even trickier

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.000
with the introduction of cyber weapons.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.000
Why? Because no nation

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.000
knows for sure whether its neighbor

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000
is about to attack.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.000
So nations may live under the threat

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.000
of what Nobel Prize winner Thomas Schelling

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000
called the "reciprocal fear of surprise attack,"

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.000
as I don't know if my neighbor

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000
is about to attack me or not --

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.000
I may never know --

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.000
so I might take the upper hand

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:22.000
and attack first.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.000
Just last week,

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:28.000
in a New York Times article dated January 26, 2010,

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000
it was revealed for the first time that

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.000
officials at the National Security Agency

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:37.000
were considering the possibility of preemptive attacks

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:40.000
in cases where the U.S. was about

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.000
to be cyberattacked.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.000
And these preemptive attacks

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:46.000
might not just remain

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:49.000
in cyberspace.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:55.000
In May 2009, General Kevin Chilton,

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:58.000
commander of the U.S. nuclear forces,

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:03.000
stated that in the event of cyberattacks against the U.S.,

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.000
all options would be on the table.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.000
Cyber weapons do not replace

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.000
conventional or nuclear weapons --

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:15.000
they just add a new layer to the existing system of terror.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.000
But in doing so, they also add their own risk

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.000
of triggering a conflict --

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.000
as we've just seen, a very important risk --

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.000
and a risk we may have to confront

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.000
with a collective security solution

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.000
which includes all of us:

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000
European allies, NATO members,

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.000
our American friends and allies,

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.000
our other Western allies,

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.000
and maybe, by forcing their hand a little,

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:40.000
our Russian and Chinese partners.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000
The information technologies

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:43.500
Joël de Rosnay was talking about,

00:08:43.500 --> 00:08:46.000
which were historically born from military research,

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.000
are today on the verge of developing

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.000
an offensive capability of destruction,

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:55.000
which could tomorrow, if we're not careful,

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:58.000
completely destroy world peace.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.000
Thank you.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.000
(Applause)
