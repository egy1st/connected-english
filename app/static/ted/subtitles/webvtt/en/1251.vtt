00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
So today, I would like to talk with you

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
about bionics,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
which is the popular term

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
for the science of replacing part of a living organism

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
with a mechatronic device, or a robot.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
It is essentially

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
the stuff of life meets machine.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
And specifically, I'd like to talk with you

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
about how bionics is evolving

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
for people with arm amputations.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
This is our motivation.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Arm amputation causes a huge disability.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
I mean, the functional impairment is clear.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Our hands are amazing instruments.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
And when you lose one, far less both,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
it's a lot harder to do the things

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
we physically need to do.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
There's also a huge emotional impact.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
And actually, I spend as much of my time in clinic

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
dealing with the emotional adjustment of patients

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
as with the physical disability.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
And finally, there's a profound social impact.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
We talk with our hands.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
We greet with our hands.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
And we interact with the physical world with our hands.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
And when they're missing,

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
it's a barrier.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
Arm amputation is usually caused by trauma,

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
with things like industrial accidents,

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
motor vehicle collisions

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
or, very poignantly, war.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
There are also some children who are born without arms,

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
called congenital limb deficiency.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
Unfortunately, we don't do great

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
with upper-limb prosthetics.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
There are two general types.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
They're called body-powered prostheses,

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
which were invented just after the Civil War,

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
refined in World War I and World War II.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
Here you see a patent

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
for an arm in 1912.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
It's not a lot different

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
than the one you see on my patient.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
They work by harnessing shoulder power.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
So when you squish your shoulders, they pull on a bicycle cable.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
And that bicycle cable can open or close a hand or a hook

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
or bend an elbow.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
And we still use them commonly,

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
because they're very robust

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
and relatively simple devices.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
The state of the art

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
is what we call myoelectric prostheses.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
These are motorized devices

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
that are controlled

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
by little electrical signals from your muscle.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
Every time you contract a muscle,

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
it emits a little electricity

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
that you can record with antennae or electrodes

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
and use that to operate the motorized prosthesis.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
They work pretty well

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
for people who have just lost their hand,

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
because your hand muscles are still there.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
You squeeze your hand, these muscles contract.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
You open it, these muscles contract.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000
So it's intuitive, and it works pretty well.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
Well how about with higher levels of amputation?

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
Now you've lost your arm above the elbow.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
You're missing not only these muscles,

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
but your hand and your elbow too.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
What do you do?

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
Well our patients have to use

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000
very code-y systems

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
of using just their arm muscles

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
to operate robotic limbs.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
We have robotic limbs.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000
There are several available on the market, and here you see a few.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000
They contain just a hand that will open and close,

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
a wrist rotator and an elbow.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000
There's no other functions.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000
If they did, how would we tell them what to do?

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000
We built our own arm at the Rehab Institute of Chicago

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000
where we've added some wrist flexion and shoulder joints

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000
to get up to six motors, or six degrees of freedom.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000
And we've had the opportunity to work with some very advanced arms

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000
that were funded by the U.S. military, using these prototypes,

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.000
that had up to 10 different degrees of freedom

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000
including movable hands.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
But at the end of the day,

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000
how do we tell these robotic arms what to do?

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
How do we control them?

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000
Well we need a neural interface,

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000
a way to connect to our nervous system

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000
or our thought processes

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000
so that it's intuitive, it's natural,

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.000
like for you and I.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.000
Well the body works by starting a motor command in your brain,

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000
going down your spinal cord,

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000
out the nerves and to your periphery.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000
And your sensation's the exact opposite.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000
You touch yourself, there's a stimulus

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
that comes up those very same nerves back up to your brain.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000
When you lose your arm, that nervous system still works.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.000
Those nerves can put out command signals.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000
And if I tap the nerve ending

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000
on a World War II vet,

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000
he'll still feel his missing hand.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000
So you might say,

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000
let's go to the brain

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.000
and put something in the brain to record signals,

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.000
or in the end of the peripheral nerve and record them there.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.000
And these are very exciting research areas,

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.000
but it's really, really hard.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000
You have to put in

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000
hundreds of microscopic wires

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:33.000
to record from little tiny individual neurons -- ordinary fibers

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000
that put out tiny signals

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000
that are microvolts.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000
And it's just too hard

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000
to use now and for my patients today.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.000
So we developed a different approach.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.000
We're using a biological amplifier

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.000
to amplify these nerve signals -- muscles.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
Muscles will amplify the nerve signals

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000
about a thousand-fold,

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000
so that we can record them from on top of the skin,

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000
like you saw earlier.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.000
So our approach is something we call targeted reinnervation.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.000
Imagine, with somebody who's lost their whole arm,

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000
we still have four major nerves

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000
that go down your arm.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.000
And we take the nerve away from your chest muscle

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.000
and let these nerves grow into it.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000
Now you think, "Close hand," and a little section of your chest contracts.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000
You think, "Bend elbow,"

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000
a different section contracts.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000
And we can use electrodes or antennae

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.000
to pick that up and tell the arm to move.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000
That's the idea.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.000
So this is the first man that we tried it on.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.000
His name is Jesse Sullivan.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000
He's just a saint of a man --

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.000
54-year-old lineman who touched the wrong wire

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.000
and had both of his arms burnt so badly

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000
they had to be amputated at the shoulder.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000
Jesse came to us at the RIC

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.000
to be fit with these state-of-the-art devices, and here you see them.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.000
I'm still using that old technology

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000
with a bicycle cable on his right side.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.000
And he picks which joint he wants to move with those chin switches.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.000
On the left side he's got a modern motorized prosthesis

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000
with those three joints,

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.000
and he operates little pads in his shoulder

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.000
that he touches to make the arm go.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000
And Jesse's a good crane operator,

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000
and he did okay by our standards.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.000
He also required a revision surgery on his chest.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000
And that gave us the opportunity

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000
to do targeted reinnervation.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.000
So my colleague, Dr. Greg Dumanian, did the surgery.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.000
First, we cut away the nerve to his own muscle,

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.000
then we took the arm nerves

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000
and just kind of had them shift down onto his chest

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000
and closed him up.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000
And after about three months,

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.000
the nerves grew in a little bit and we could get a twitch.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.000
And after six months, the nerves grew in well,

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.000
and you could see strong contractions.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.000
And this is what it looks like.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000
This is what happens when Jesse thinks

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000
open and close his hand,

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.000
or bend or straighten your elbow.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000
You can see the movements on his chest,

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000
and those little hash marks

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000
are where we put our antennae, or electrodes.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000
And I challenge anybody in the room

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.000
to make their chest go like this.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.000
His brain is thinking about his arm.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.000
He has not learned how to do this with the chest.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000
There is not a learning process.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.000
That's why it's intuitive.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.000
So here's Jesse in our first little test with him.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.000
On the left-hand side, you see his original prosthesis,

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.000
and he's using those switches

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.000
to move little blocks from one box to the other.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:19.000
He's had that arm for about 20 months, so he's pretty good with it.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.000
On the right side,

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.000
two months after we fit him with his targeted reinnervation prosthesis --

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.000
which, by the way, is the same physical arm,

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000
just programmed a little different --

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000
you can see that he's much faster

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:34.000
and much smoother as he moves these little blocks.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:37.000
And we're only able to use three of the signals at this time.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:42.000
Then we had one of those little surprises in science.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.000
So we're all motivated to get motor commands

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.000
to drive robotic arms.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.000
And after a few months,

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.000
you touch Jesse on his chest,

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:53.000
and he felt his missing hand.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.000
His hand sensation grew into his chest again

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:58.000
probably because we had also taken away a lot of fat,

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000
so the skin was right down to the muscle

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000
and deinnervated, if you would, his skin.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000
So you touch Jesse here, he feels his thumb;

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.000
you touch it here, he feels his pinky.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.000
He feels light touch

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.000
down to one gram of force.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:13.000
He feels hot, cold, sharp, dull,

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.000
all in his missing hand,

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.000
or both his hand and his chest,

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.000
but he can attend to either.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.000
So this is really exciting for us,

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.000
because now we have a portal,

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:27.000
a portal, or a way to potentially give back sensation,

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.000
so that he might feel what he touches

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000
with his prosthetic hand.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.000
Imagine sensors in the hand

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.000
coming up and pressing on this new hand skin.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.000
So it was very exciting.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.000
We've also gone on

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000
with what was initially our primary population

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.000
of people with above-the-elbow amputations.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:47.000
And here we deinnervate, or cut the nerve away,

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.000
just from little segments of muscle

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000
and leave others alone

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.000
that give us our up-down signals

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:56.000
and two others that will give us a hand open and close signal.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.000
This was one of our first patients, Chris.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.000
You see him with his original device

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000
on the left there after eight months of use,

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000
and on the right, it is two months.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:07.000
He's about four or five times as fast

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:10.000
with this simple little performance metric.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.000
All right.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.000
So one of the best parts of my job

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.000
is working with really great patients

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.000
who are also our research collaborators.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.000
And we're fortunate today

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.000
to have Amanda Kitts come and join us.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.000
Please welcome Amanda Kitts.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:32.000
(Applause)

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:35.000
So Amanda, would you please tell us how you lost your arm?

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:38.000
Amanda Kitts: Sure. In 2006, I had a car accident.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:41.000
And I was driving home from work,

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.000
and a truck was coming the opposite direction,

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.000
came over into my lane,

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:49.000
ran over the top of my car and his axle tore my arm off.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:52.000
Todd Kuiken: Okay, so after your amputation, you healed up.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.000
And you've got one of these conventional arms.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:57.000
Can you tell us how it worked?

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.000
AK: Well, it was a little difficult,

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.000
because all I had to work with was a bicep and a tricep.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:04.000
So for the simple little things like picking something up,

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:07.000
I would have to bend my elbow,

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.000
and then I would have to cocontract

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.000
to get it to change modes.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.000
When I did that,

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:16.000
I had to use my bicep

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.000
to get the hand to close,

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.000
use my tricep to get it to open,

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.000
cocontract again

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.000
to get the elbow to work again.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.000
TK: So it was a little slow?

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:29.000
AK: A little slow, and it was just hard to work.

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.000
You had to concentrate a whole lot.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:34.000
TK: Okay, so I think about nine months later

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.000
that you had the targeted reinnervation surgery,

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:39.000
took six more months to have all the reinnervation.

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:42.000
Then we fit her with a prosthesis.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.000
And how did that work for you?

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:47.000
AK: It works good.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:51.000
I was able to use my elbow

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:54.000
and my hand simultaneously.

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.000
I could work them just by my thoughts.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:59.000
So I didn't have to do any of the cocontracting and all that.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.000
TK: A little faster?

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:05.000
AK: A little faster. And much more easy, much more natural.

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:08.000
TK: Okay, this was my goal.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:11.000
For 20 years, my goal was to let somebody

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:14.000
[be] able to use their elbow and hand in an intuitive way

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.000
and at the same time.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:19.000
And we now have over 50 patients around the world who have had this surgery,

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.000
including over a dozen of our wounded warriors

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.000
in the U.S. armed services.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:26.000
The success rate of the nerve transfers is very high.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.000
It's like 96 percent.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:31.000
Because we're putting a big fat nerve onto a little piece of muscle.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:35.000
And it provides intuitive control.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:37.000
Our functional testing, those little tests,

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.000
all show that they're a lot quicker and a lot easier.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.000
And the most important thing

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:43.000
is our patients have appreciated it.

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.000
So that was all very exciting.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:48.000
But we want to do better.

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:52.000
There's a lot of information in those nerve signals,

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.000
and we wanted to get more.

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:57.000
You can move each finger. You can move your thumb, your wrist.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.000
Can we get more out of it?

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.000
So we did some experiments

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:04.000
where we saturated our poor patients with zillions of electrodes

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:07.000
and then had them try to do two dozen different tasks --

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:10.000
from wiggling a finger to moving a whole arm

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.000
to reaching for something --

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.000
and recorded this data.

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.000
And then we used some algorithms

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.000
that are a lot like speech recognition algorithms,

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.000
called pattern recognition.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.000
See.

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:24.000
(Laughter)

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:26.000
And here you can see, on Jesse's chest,

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.000
when he just tried to do three different things,

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.000
you can see three different patterns.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.000
But I can't put in an electrode

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.000
and say, "Go there."

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:37.000
So we collaborated with our colleagues in University of New Brunswick,

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.000
came up with this algorithm control,

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:41.000
which Amanda can now demonstrate.

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:46.000
AK: So I have the elbow that goes up and down.

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.000
I have the wrist rotation

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:51.000
that goes -- and it can go all the way around.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:55.000
And I have the wrist flexion and extension.

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:58.000
And I also have the hand closed and open.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.000
TK: Thank you, Amanda.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.000
Now this is a research arm,

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:05.000
but it's made out of commercial components from here down

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:08.000
and a few that I've borrowed from around the world.

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:11.000
It's about seven pounds,

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:13.000
which is probably about what my arm would weigh

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:15.000
if I lost it right here.

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:18.000
Obviously, that's heavy for Amanda.

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:20.000
And in fact, it feels even heavier,

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.000
because it's not glued on the same.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.000
She's carrying all the weight through harnesses.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:27.000
So the exciting part isn't so much the mechatronics,

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:29.000
but the control.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:32.000
So we've developed a small microcomputer

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:35.000
that is blinking somewhere behind her back

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:37.000
and is operating this

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:39.000
all by the way she trains it

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:41.000
to use her individual muscle signals.

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:43.000
So Amanda, when you first started using this arm,

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:46.000
how long did it take to use it?

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.000
AK: It took just about probably three to four hours

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.000
to get it to train.

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.000
I had to hook it up to a computer,

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:54.000
so I couldn't just train it anywhere.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:57.000
So if it stopped working, I just had to take it off.

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:59.000
So now it's able to train

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:01.000
with just this little piece on the back.

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:03.000
I can wear it around.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:06.000
If it stops working for some reason, I can retrain it.

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:08.000
Takes about a minute.

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:10.000
TK: So we're really excited,

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:13.000
because now we're getting to a clinically practical device.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:15.000
And that's where our goal is --

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:19.000
to have something clinically pragmatic to wear.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:22.000
We've also had Amanda able to use

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:25.000
some of our more advanced arms that I showed you earlier.

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:29.000
Here's Amanda using an arm made by DEKA Research Corporation.

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:33.000
And I believe Dean Kamen presented it at TED a few years ago.

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:35.000
So Amanda, you can see,

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:37.000
has really good control.

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.000
It's all the pattern recognition.

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:42.000
And it now has a hand that can do different grasps.

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:45.000
What we do is have the patient go all the way open

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:48.000
and think, "What hand grasp pattern do I want?"

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:50.000
It goes into that mode,

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:52.000
and then you can do up to five or six different hand grasps with this hand.

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:55.000
Amanda, how many were you able to do with the DEKA arm?

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:57.000
AK: I was able to get four.

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:00.000
I had the key grip, I had a chuck grip,

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.000
I had a power grasp

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:04.000
and I had a fine pinch.

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:06.000
But my favorite one was just when the hand was open,

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:08.000
because I work with kids,

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:11.000
and so all the time you're clapping and singing,

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:14.000
so I was able to do that again, which was really good.

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:16.000
TK: That hand's not so good for clapping.

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:18.000
AK: Can't clap with this one.

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.000
TK: All right. So that's exciting

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:22.000
on where we may go with the better mechatronics,

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:24.000
if we make them good enough

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:27.000
to put out on the market and use in a field trial.

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:29.000
I want you to watch closely.

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:31.000
(Video) Claudia: Oooooh!

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:33.000
TK: That's Claudia,

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:35.000
and that was the first time

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:38.000
she got to feel sensation through her prosthetic.

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:41.000
She had a little sensor at the end of her prosthesis

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:44.000
that then she rubbed over different surfaces,

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:46.000
and she could feel different textures

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:49.000
of sandpaper, different grits, ribbon cable,

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:52.000
as it pushed on her reinnervated hand skin.

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:55.000
She said that when she just ran it across the table,

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:57.000
it felt like her finger was rocking.

00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:59.000
So that's an exciting laboratory experiment

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:02.000
on how to give back, potentially, some skin sensation.

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:05.000
But here's another video that shows some of our challenges.

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:08.000
This is Jesse, and he's squeezing a foam toy.

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:11.000
And the harder he squeezes -- you see a little black thing in the middle

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:14.000
that's pushing on his skin proportional to how hard he squeezes.

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:16.000
But look at all the electrodes around it.

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:18.000
I've got a real estate problem.

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:20.000
You're supposed to put a bunch of these things on there,

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:23.000
but our little motor's making all kinds of noise

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:25.000
right next to my electrodes.

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:28.000
So we're really challenged on what we're doing there.

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:30.000
The future is bright.

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:33.000
We're excited about where we are and a lot of things we want to do.

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:35.000
So for example,

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:38.000
one is to get rid of my real estate problem

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:40.000
and get better signals.

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:43.000
We want to develop these little tiny capsules

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:45.000
about the size of a piece of risotto

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:47.000
that we can put into the muscles

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:50.000
and telemeter out the EMG signals,

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:53.000
so that it's not worrying about electrode contact.

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:55.000
And we can have the real estate open

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:57.000
to try more sensation feedback.

00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:59.000
We want to build a better arm.

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:03.000
This arm -- they're always made for the 50th percentile male --

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:07.000
which means they're too big for five-eighths of the world.

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:10.000
So rather than a super strong or super fast arm,

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:12.000
we're making an arm that is --

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:14.000
we're starting with,

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:17.000
the 25th percentile female --

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:19.000
that will have a hand that wraps around,

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:21.000
opens all the way,

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:24.000
two degrees of freedom in the wrist and an elbow.

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:26.000
So it'll be the smallest and lightest

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:28.000
and the smartest arm ever made.

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:30.000
Once we can do it that small,

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:32.000
it's a lot easier making them bigger.

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:35.000
So those are just some of our goals.

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:39.000
And we really appreciate you all being here today.

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:41.000
I'd like to tell you a little bit about the dark side,

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:43.000
with yesterday's theme.

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:45.000
So Amanda came jet-lagged,

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:47.000
she's using the arm,

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:49.000
and everything goes wrong.

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:51.000
There was a computer spook,

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:53.000
a broken wire,

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:55.000
a converter that sparked.

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:57.000
We took out a whole circuit in the hotel

00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:59.000
and just about put on the fire alarm.

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:02.000
And none of those problems could I have dealt with,

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:04.000
but I have a really bright research team.

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:07.000
And thankfully Dr. Annie Simon was with us

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:09.000
and worked really hard yesterday to fix it.

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:11.000
That's science.

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:13.000
And fortunately, it worked today.

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:15.000
So thank you very much.

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:29.000
(Applause)
