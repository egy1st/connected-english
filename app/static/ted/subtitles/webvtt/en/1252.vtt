00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:15.000
(Music)

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
What you just heard

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
are the interactions of barometric pressure, wind and temperature readings

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
that were recorded of Hurricane Noel in 2007.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
The musicians played off a three-dimensional graph of weather data like this.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Every single bead, every single colored band,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
represents a weather element

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
that can also be read as a musical note.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
I find weather extremely fascinating.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
Weather is an amalgam of systems

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
that is inherently invisible to most of us.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
So I use sculpture and music

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
to make it, not just visible,

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
but also tactile and audible.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
All of my work begins very simple.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
I extract information from a specific environment

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
using very low-tech data collecting devices --

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
generally anything I can find in the hardware store.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
I then compare my information to the things I find on the Internet --

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
satellite images, weather data

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
from weather stations as well as offshore buoys.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
That's both historical as well as real data.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
And then I compile all of these numbers on these clipboards that you see here.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
These clipboards are filled with numbers.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
And from all of these numbers,

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
I start with only two or three variables.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
That begins my translation process.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
My translation medium is a very simple basket.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.000
A basket is made up of horizontal and vertical elements.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
When I assign values to the vertical and horizontal elements,

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
I can use the changes of those data points over time

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
to create the form.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
I use natural reed,

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
because natural reed has a lot of tension in it

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
that I cannot fully control.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
That means that it is the numbers that control the form,

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
not me.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
What I come up with are forms like these.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
These forms are completely made up

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
of weather data or science data.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
Every colored bead, every colored string,

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
represents a weather element.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
And together, these elements, not only construct the form,

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
but they also reveal behavioral relationships

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
that may not come across

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
through a two-dimensional graph.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
When you step closer, you actually see

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
that it is indeed all made up of numbers.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
The vertical elements

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
are assigned a specific hour of the day.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
So all the way around, you have a 24-hour timeline.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
But it's also used to assign a temperature range.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
On that grid, I can then weave the high tide readings,

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
water temperature, air temperature and Moon phases.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
I also translate weather data into musical scores.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000
And musical notation allows me a more nuanced way

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
of translating information

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
without compromising it.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
So all of these scores are made up of weather data.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
Every single color, dot, every single line,

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
is a weather element.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000
And together, these variables construct a score.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
I use these scores to collaborate with musicians.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000
This is the 1913 Trio

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
performing one of my pieces

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
at the Milwaukee Art Museum.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000
Meanwhile, I use these scores as blueprints

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.000
to translate into sculptural forms like this,

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000
that function still in the sense

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000
of being a three-dimensional weather visualization,

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
but now they're embedding

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
the visual matrix of the musical score,

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000
so it can actually be read as a musical score.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
What I love about this work

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
is that it challenges our assumptions

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000
of what kind of visual vocabulary belongs in the world of art, versus science.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000
This piece here is read very differently

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
depending on where you place it.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
You place it in an art museum, it becomes a sculpture.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
You place it in a science museum,

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.000
it becomes a three-dimensional visualization of data.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000
You place it in a music hall,

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000
it all of a sudden becomes a musical score.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000
And I really like that,

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000
because the viewer is really challenged

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000
as to what visual language

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000
is part of science versus art versus music.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000
The other reason why I really like this

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000
is because it offers an alternative entry point

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000
into the complexity of science.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000
And not everyone has a Ph.D. in science.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000
So for me, that was my way into it.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000
Thank you.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000
(Applause)
