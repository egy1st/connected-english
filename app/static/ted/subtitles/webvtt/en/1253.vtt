WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
You all know the truth of what I'm going to say.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
I think the intuition that inequality is divisive and socially corrosive

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
has been around since before the French Revolution.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
What's changed

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
is we now can look at the evidence,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
we can compare societies, more and less equal societies,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
and see what inequality does.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
I'm going to take you through that data

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
and then explain why

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
the links I'm going to be showing you exist.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
But first, see what a miserable lot we are.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
(Laughter)

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
I want to start though

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
with a paradox.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
This shows you life expectancy

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
against gross national income --

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
how rich countries are on average.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
And you see the countries on the right,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
like Norway and the USA,

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.000
are twice as rich as Israel, Greece, Portugal on the left.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000
And it makes no difference to their life expectancy at all.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
There's no suggestion of a relationship there.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
But if we look within our societies,

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
there are extraordinary social gradients in health

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
running right across society.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
This, again, is life expectancy.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
These are small areas of England and Wales --

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000
the poorest on the right, the richest on the left.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
A lot of difference between the poor and the rest of us.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
Even the people just below the top

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
have less good health

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
than the people at the top.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
So income means something very important

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
within our societies,

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
and nothing between them.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
The explanation of that paradox

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
is that, within our societies,

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
we're looking at relative income

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
or social position, social status --

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
where we are in relation to each other

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
and the size of the gaps between us.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
And as soon as you've got that idea,

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
you should immediately wonder:

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
what happens if we widen the differences,

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
or compress them,

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
make the income differences bigger or smaller?

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
And that's what I'm going to show you.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
I'm not using any hypothetical data.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
I'm taking data from the U.N. --

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
it's the same as the World Bank has --

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
on the scale of income differences

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000
in these rich developed market democracies.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
The measure we've used,

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
because it's easy to understand and you can download it,

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
is how much richer the top 20 percent

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000
than the bottom 20 percent in each country.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
And you see in the more equal countries on the left --

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
Japan, Finland, Norway, Sweden --

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
the top 20 percent are about three and a half, four times as rich

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
as the bottom 20 percent.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
But on the more unequal end --

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
U.K., Portugal, USA, Singapore --

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000
the differences are twice as big.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000
On that measure, we are twice as unequal

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.000
as some of the other successful market democracies.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.000
Now I'm going to show you what that does to our societies.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
We collected data on problems with social gradients,

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
the kind of problems that are more common

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
at the bottom of the social ladder.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000
Internationally comparable data on life expectancy,

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000
on kids' maths and literacy scores,

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000
on infant mortality rates, homicide rates,

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000
proportion of the population in prison, teenage birthrates,

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000
levels of trust,

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
obesity, mental illness --

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000
which in standard diagnostic classification

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
includes drug and alcohol addiction --

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
and social mobility.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000
We put them all in one index.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
They're all weighted equally.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.000
Where a country is is a sort of average score on these things.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
And there, you see it

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.000
in relation to the measure of inequality I've just shown you,

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.000
which I shall use over and over again in the data.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000
The more unequal countries

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000
are doing worse

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000
on all these kinds of social problems.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.000
It's an extraordinarily close correlation.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000
But if you look at that same index

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000
of health and social problems

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000
in relation to GNP per capita,

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000
gross national income,

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000
there's nothing there,

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.000
no correlation anymore.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
We were a little bit worried

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000
that people might think

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000
we'd been choosing problems to suit our argument

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.000
and just manufactured this evidence,

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.000
so we also did a paper in the British Medical Journal

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:15.000
on the UNICEF index of child well-being.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000
It has 40 different components

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000
put together by other people.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.000
It contains whether kids can talk to their parents,

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000
whether they have books at home,

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000
what immunization rates are like, whether there's bullying at school.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000
Everything goes into it.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:33.000
Here it is in relation to that same measure of inequality.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000
Kids do worse in the more unequal societies.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.000
Highly significant relationship.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000
But once again,

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.000
if you look at that measure of child well-being,

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000
in relation to national income per person,

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000
there's no relationship,

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.000
no suggestion of a relationship.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000
What all the data I've shown you so far says

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000
is the same thing.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000
The average well-being of our societies

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.000
is not dependent any longer

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.000
on national income and economic growth.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000
That's very important in poorer countries,

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000
but not in the rich developed world.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000
But the differences between us

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000
and where we are in relation to each other

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.000
now matter very much.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.000
I'm going to show you some of the separate bits of our index.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000
Here, for instance, is trust.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000
It's simply the proportion of the population

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000
who agree most people can be trusted.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000
It comes from the World Values Survey.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000
You see, at the more unequal end,

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.000
it's about 15 percent of the population

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.000
who feel they can trust others.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000
But in the more equal societies,

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:40.000
it rises to 60 or 65 percent.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.000
And if you look at measures of involvement in community life

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000
or social capital,

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000
very similar relationships

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.000
closely related to inequality.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.000
I may say, we did all this work twice.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.000
We did it first on these rich, developed countries,

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000
and then as a separate test bed,

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.000
we repeated it all on the 50 American states --

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.000
asking just the same question:

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000
do the more unequal states

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000
do worse on all these kinds of measures?

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:11.000
So here is trust from a general social survey of the federal government

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.000
related to inequality.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000
Very similar scatter

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000
over a similar range of levels of trust.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.000
Same thing is going on.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.000
Basically we found

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.000
that almost anything that's related to trust internationally

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000
is related to trust amongst the 50 states

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000
in that separate test bed.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000
We're not just talking about a fluke.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000
This is mental illness.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000
WHO put together figures

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000
using the same diagnostic interviews

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.000
on random samples of the population

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.000
to allow us to compare rates of mental illness

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.000
in each society.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.000
This is the percent of the population

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.000
with any mental illness in the preceding year.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.000
And it goes from about eight percent

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000
up to three times that --

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000
whole societies

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.000
with three times the level of mental illness of others.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:02.000
And again, closely related to inequality.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000
This is violence.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.000
These red dots are American states,

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:10.000
and the blue triangles are Canadian provinces.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.000
But look at the scale of the differences.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:16.000
It goes from 15 homicides per million

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:19.000
up to 150.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:22.000
This is the proportion of the population in prison.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:25.000
There's a about a tenfold difference there,

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.000
log scale up the side.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000
But it goes from about 40 to 400

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:32.000
people in prison.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.000
That relationship

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000
is not mainly driven by more crime.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.000
In some places, that's part of it.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.000
But most of it is about more punitive sentencing,

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.000
harsher sentencing.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.000
And the more unequal societies

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:49.000
are more likely also to retain the death penalty.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:54.000
Here we have children dropping out of high school.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.000
Again, quite big differences.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.000
Extraordinarily damaging,

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:01.000
if you're talking about using the talents of the population.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:04.000
This is social mobility.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.000
It's actually a measure of mobility

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.000
based on income.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.000
Basically, it's asking:

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000
do rich fathers have rich sons

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.000
and poor fathers have poor sons,

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:17.000
or is there no relationship between the two?

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.000
And at the more unequal end,

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:22.000
fathers' income is much more important --

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:25.000
in the U.K., USA.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.000
And in Scandinavian countries,

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.000
fathers' income is much less important.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:32.000
There's more social mobility.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.000
And as we like to say --

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:37.000
and I know there are a lot of Americans in the audience here --

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:40.000
if Americans want to live the American dream,

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000
they should go to Denmark.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.000
(Laughter)

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:48.000
(Applause)

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.000
I've shown you just a few things in italics here.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.000
I could have shown a number of other problems.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.000
They're all problems that tend to be more common

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.000
at the bottom of the social gradient.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:02.000
But there are endless problems with social gradients

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000
that are worse in more unequal countries --

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.000
not just a little bit worse,

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:09.000
but anything from twice as common to 10 times as common.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.000
Think of the expense,

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:14.000
the human cost of that.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.000
I want to go back though to this graph that I showed you earlier

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.000
where we put it all together

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.000
to make two points.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:23.000
One is that, in graph after graph,

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.000
we find the countries that do worse,

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.000
whatever the outcome,

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.000
seem to be the more unequal ones,

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.000
and the ones that do well

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:34.000
seem to be the Nordic countries and Japan.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.000
So what we're looking at

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.000
is general social disfunction related to inequality.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.000
It's not just one or two things that go wrong,

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.000
it's most things.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:46.000
The other really important point I want to make on this graph

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.000
is that, if you look at the bottom,

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:51.000
Sweden and Japan,

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:54.000
they're very different countries in all sorts of ways.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.000
The position of women,

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.000
how closely they keep to the nuclear family,

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.000
are on opposite ends of the poles

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.000
in terms of the rich developed world.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.000
But another really important difference

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:07.000
is how they get their greater equality.

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:10.000
Sweden has huge differences in earnings,

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.000
and it narrows the gap through taxation,

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.000
general welfare state,

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:17.000
generous benefits and so on.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.000
Japan is rather different though.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:22.000
It starts off with much smaller differences in earnings before tax.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.000
It has lower taxes.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.000
It has a smaller welfare state.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.000
And in our analysis of the American states,

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.000
we find rather the same contrast.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:33.000
There are some states that do well through redistribution,

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.000
some states that do well

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:38.000
because they have smaller income differences before tax.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.000
So we conclude

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:43.000
that it doesn't much matter how you get your greater equality,

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.000
as long as you get there somehow.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.000
I am not talking about perfect equality,

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:51.000
I'm talking about what exists in rich developed market democracies.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:58.000
Another really surprising part of this picture

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.000
is that it's not just the poor

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:03.000
who are affected by inequality.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:05.000
There seems to be some truth in John Donne's

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:08.000
"No man is an island."

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:11.000
And in a number of studies, it's possible to compare

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:14.000
how people do in more and less equal countries

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:17.000
at each level in the social hierarchy.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:20.000
This is just one example.

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.000
It's infant mortality.

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:25.000
Some Swedes very kindly classified a lot of their infant deaths

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:30.000
according to the British register of general socioeconomic classification.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:33.000
And so it's anachronistically

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.000
a classification by fathers' occupations,

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:37.000
so single parents go on their own.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:40.000
But then where it says "low social class,"

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:43.000
that's unskilled manual occupations.

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:47.000
It goes through towards the skilled manual occupations in the middle,

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.000
then the junior non-manual,

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:52.000
going up high to the professional occupations --

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.000
doctors, lawyers,

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.000
directors of larger companies.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:59.000
You see there that Sweden does better than Britain

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:02.000
all the way across the social hierarchy.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.000
The biggest differences are at the bottom of society.

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.000
But even at the top,

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.000
there seems to be a small benefit

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.000
to being in a more equal society.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:15.000
We show that on about five different sets of data

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:17.000
covering educational outcomes

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:20.000
and health in the United States and internationally.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:23.000
And that seems to be the general picture --

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:26.000
that greater equality makes most difference at the bottom,

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:29.000
but has some benefits even at the top.

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:33.000
But I should say a few words about what's going on.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:35.000
I think I'm looking and talking

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:38.000
about the psychosocial effects of inequality.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:41.000
More to do with feelings of superiority and inferiority,

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.000
of being valued and devalued,

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:46.000
respected and disrespected.

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.000
And of course, those feelings

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:51.000
of the status competition that comes out of that

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:54.000
drives the consumerism in our society.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:57.000
It also leads to status insecurity.

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:01.000
We worry more about how we're judged and seen by others,

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:04.000
whether we're regarded as attractive, clever,

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:07.000
all that kind of thing.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:10.000
The social-evaluative judgments increase,

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:14.000
the fear of those social-evaluative judgments.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.000
Interestingly,

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:20.000
some parallel work going on in social psychology:

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:23.000
some people reviewed 208 different studies

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:26.000
in which volunteers had been invited

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:28.000
into a psychological laboratory

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.000
and had their stress hormones,

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:34.000
their responses to doing stressful tasks, measured.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:36.000
And in the review,

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.000
what they were interested in seeing

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.000
is what kind of stresses

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:43.000
most reliably raise levels of cortisol,

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:45.000
the central stress hormone.

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.000
And the conclusion was

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:50.000
it was tasks that included social-evaluative threat --

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:53.000
threats to self-esteem or social status

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:56.000
in which others can negatively judge your performance.

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:58.000
Those kind of stresses

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:01.000
have a very particular effect

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:04.000
on the physiology of stress.

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:07.000
Now we have been criticized.

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:10.000
Of course, there are people who dislike this stuff

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:13.000
and people who find it very surprising.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:15.000
I should tell you though

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:18.000
that when people criticize us for picking and choosing data,

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:20.000
we never pick and choose data.

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:22.000
We have an absolute rule

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:25.000
that if our data source has data for one of the countries we're looking at,

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:27.000
it goes into the analysis.

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:29.000
Our data source decides

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:31.000
whether it's reliable data,

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:33.000
we don't.

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:35.000
Otherwise that would introduce bias.

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:37.000
What about other countries?

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:40.000
There are 200 studies

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:43.000
of health in relation to income and equality

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:46.000
in the academic peer-reviewed journals.

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:49.000
This isn't confined to these countries here,

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:51.000
hiding a very simple demonstration.

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:53.000
The same countries,

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:55.000
the same measure of inequality,

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:58.000
one problem after another.

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:01.000
Why don't we control for other factors?

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.000
Well we've shown you that GNP per capita

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:05.000
doesn't make any difference.

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:09.000
And of course, others using more sophisticated methods in the literature

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:11.000
have controlled for poverty and education

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:14.000
and so on.

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:17.000
What about causality?

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:20.000
Correlation in itself doesn't prove causality.

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:22.000
We spend a good bit of time.

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:24.000
And indeed, people know the causal links quite well

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:26.000
in some of these outcomes.

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:28.000
The big change in our understanding

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:30.000
of drivers of chronic health

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:32.000
in the rich developed world

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:36.000
is how important chronic stress from social sources

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:38.000
is affecting the immune system,

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:41.000
the cardiovascular system.

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:43.000
Or for instance, the reason why violence

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:46.000
becomes more common in more unequal societies

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:51.000
is because people are sensitive to being looked down on.

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:54.000
I should say that to deal with this,

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:56.000
we've got to deal with the post-tax things

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:58.000
and the pre-tax things.

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:01.000
We've got to constrain income,

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:03.000
the bonus culture incomes at the top.

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:06.000
I think we must make our bosses accountable to their employees

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:09.000
in any way we can.

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:12.000
I think the take-home message though

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:16.000
is that we can improve the real quality of human life

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:19.000
by reducing the differences in incomes between us.

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:21.000
Suddenly we have a handle

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:23.000
on the psychosocial well-being of whole societies,

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:25.000
and that's exciting.

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:27.000
Thank you.

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:33.000
(Applause)
