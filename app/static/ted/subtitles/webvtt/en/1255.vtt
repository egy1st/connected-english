WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Thank you.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
It's a real pleasure to be here.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
I last did a TED Talk

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
I think about seven years ago or so.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
I talked about spaghetti sauce.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
And so many people,
I guess, watch those videos.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
People have been
coming up to me ever since

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
to ask me questions about spaghetti sauce,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
which is a wonderful thing
in the short term --

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
(Laughter)

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
but it's proven to be less than ideal

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
over seven years.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
And so I though I would come

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
and try and put spaghetti sauce behind me.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
(Laughter)

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
The theme of this morning's
session is Things We Make.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
And so I thought I would tell a story

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
about someone

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
who made one of the most precious objects

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
of his era.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
And the man's name is Carl Norden.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
Carl Norden was born in 1880.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
And he was Swiss.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
And of course, the Swiss can be divided

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
into two general categories:

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
those who make small, exquisite,

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
expensive objects

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
and those who handle the money

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
of those who buy small, exquisite,

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
expensive objects.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
And Carl Norden is very
firmly in the former camp.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
He's an engineer.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
He goes to the Federal Polytech in Zurich.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
In fact, one of his classmates
is a young man named Lenin

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
who would go on

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.000
to break small, expensive,
exquisite objects.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
And he's a Swiss engineer, Carl.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
And I mean that in its
fullest sense of the word.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
He wears three-piece suits;

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.000
and he has a very, very small,
important mustache;

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
and he is domineering

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
and narcissistic

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
and driven

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
and has an extraordinary ego;

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
and he works 16-hour days;

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
and he has very strong feelings
about alternating current;

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.000
and he feels like a suntan
is a sign of moral weakness;

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
and he drinks lots of coffee;

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
and he does his best work

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
sitting in his mother's kitchen
in Zurich for hours

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
in complete silence

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
with nothing but a slide rule.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
In any case,

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
Carl Norden emigrates
to the United States

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
just before the First World War

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
and sets up shop on Lafayette Street

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
in downtown Manhattan.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
And he becomes obsessed with the question

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000
of how to drop bombs from an airplane.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
Now if you think about it,

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000
in the age before GPS and radar,

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
that was obviously
a really difficult problem.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
It's a complicated physics problem.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000
You've got a plane that's
thousands of feet up in the air,

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
going at hundreds of miles an hour,

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000
and you're trying to drop
an object, a bomb,

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
towards some stationary target

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
in the face of all kinds
of winds and cloud cover

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
and all kinds of other impediments.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
And all sorts of people,

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
moving up to the First World War
and between the wars,

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
tried to solve this problem,

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
and nearly everybody came up short.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
The bombsights that were available

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
were incredibly crude.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000
But Carl Norden is really
the one who cracks the code.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000
And he comes up with this
incredibly complicated device.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000
It weighs about 50 lbs.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.000
It's called the Norden Mark 15 bombsight.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000
And it has all kinds of levers
and ball-bearings

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000
and gadgets and gauges.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000
And he makes this complicated thing.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
And what he allows people to do

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.000
is he makes the bombardier
take this particular object,

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
visually sight the target,

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.000
because they're in the Plexiglas
cone of the bomber,

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.000
and then they plug in
the altitude of the plane,

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.000
the speed of the plane,
the speed of the wind

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000
and the coordinates

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000
of the target.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:45.000
And the bombsight will tell him
when to drop the bomb.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000
And as Norden famously says,

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000
"Before that bombsight came along,

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000
bombs would routinely miss their target

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000
by a mile or more."

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
But he said, with the
Mark 15 Norden bombsight,

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
he could drop a bomb into a pickle barrel

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
at 20,000 ft.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000
Now I cannot tell you

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000
how incredibly excited

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000
the U.S. military was

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.000
by the news of the Norden bombsight.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000
It was like manna from heaven.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000
Here was an army

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000
that had just had experience
in the First World War,

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000
where millions of men

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000
fought each other in the trenches,

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000
getting nowhere, making no progress,

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.000
and here someone had come up with a device

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
that allowed them to fly up in the skies

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
high above enemy territory

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
and destroy whatever they wanted

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000
with pinpoint accuracy.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000
And the U.S. military

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000
spends 1.5 billion dollars --

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.000
billion dollars in 1940 dollars --

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000
developing the Norden bombsight.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.000
And to put that in perspective,

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000
the total cost of the Manhattan project

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000
was three billion dollars.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.000
Half as much money was spent
on this Norden bombsight

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:57.000
as was spent on the most famous
military-industrial project

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000
of the modern era.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.000
And there were people, strategists,
within the U.S. military

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000
who genuinely thought
that this single device

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000
was going to spell the difference

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000
between defeat and victory

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000
when it came to the
battle against the Nazis

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000
and against the Japanese.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000
And for Norden as well,

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.000
this device had incredible
moral importance,

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000
because Norden was a committed Christian.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000
In fact, he would always get upset

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.000
when people referred to the
bombsight as his invention,

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000
because in his eyes,

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000
only God could invent things.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000
He was simply
the instrument of God's will.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000
And what was God's will?

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.000
Well God's will was that
the amount of suffering in any kind of war

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.000
be reduced to as small
an amount as possible.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000
And what did the Norden bombsight do?

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000
Well it allowed you to do that.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.000
It allowed you to bomb only those things

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.000
that you absolutely needed
and wanted to bomb.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.000
So in the years leading up to
the Second World War,

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.000
the U.S. military buys 90,000

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000
of these Norden bombsights

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000
at a cost of $14,000 each --

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.000
again, in 1940 dollars,
that's a lot of money.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.000
And they trained 50,000 bombardiers
on how to use them --

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.000
long extensive, months-long
training sessions --

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000
because these things are
essentially analog computers;

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000
they're not easy to use.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.000
And they make every one
of those bombardiers take an oath,

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.000
to swear that if they're ever captured,

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000
they will not divulge a single detail

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000
of this particular device to the enemy,

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.000
because it's imperative
the enemy not get their hands

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000
on this absolutely essential
piece of technology.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.000
And whenever the Norden bombsight
is taken onto a plane,

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.000
it's escorted there by
a series of armed guards.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.000
And it's carried in a box
with a canvas shroud over it.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.000
And the box is handcuffed
to one of the guards.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.000
It's never allowed to be photographed.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.000
And there's a little
incendiary device inside of it,

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.000
so that, if the plane ever crashes,
it will be destroyed

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.000
and there's no way the enemy
can ever get their hands on it.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.000
The Norden bombsight

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:55.000
is the Holy Grail.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.000
So what happens during
the Second World War?

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:01.000
Well, it turns out
it's not the Holy Grail.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.000
In practice, the Norden bombsight

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.000
can drop a bomb into
a pickle barrel at 20,000 ft.,

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.000
but that's under perfect conditions.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.000
And of course, in wartime,

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.000
conditions aren't perfect.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.000
First of all, it's really hard to use --
really hard to use.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.000
And not all of the people

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.000
who are of those 50,000 men
who are bombardiers

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:23.000
have the ability to properly
program an analog computer.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.000
Secondly, it breaks down a lot.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.000
It's full of all kinds
of gyroscopes and pulleys

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000
and gadgets and ball-bearings,

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000
and they don't work as well
as they ought to

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.000
in the heat of battle.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:36.000
Thirdly, when Norden
was making his calculations,

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.000
he assumed that a plane would be flying

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:41.000
at a relatively slow speed
at low altitudes.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.000
Well in a real war, you can't do that;

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.000
you'll get shot down.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.000
So they started flying them
at high altitudes at incredibly high speeds.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.000
And the Norden bombsight
doesn't work as well

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000
under those conditions.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000
But most of all,

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.000
the Norden bombsight
required the bombardier

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:59.000
to make visual contact with the target.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.000
But of course, what happens in real life?

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:04.000
There are clouds, right.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:07.000
It needs cloudless sky
to be really accurate.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.000
Well how many cloudless skies

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.000
do you think there
were above Central Europe

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:14.000
between 1940 and 1945?

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.000
Not a lot.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.000
And then to give you a sense

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.000
of just how inaccurate
the Norden bombsight was,

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.000
there was a famous case in 1944

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:26.000
where the Allies bombed
a chemical plant in Leuna, Germany.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000
And the chemical plant comprised

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.000
757 acres.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.000
And over the course
of 22 bombing missions,

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:38.000
the Allies dropped 85,000 bombs

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:42.000
on this 757 acre chemical plant,

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.000
using the Norden bombsight.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.000
Well what percentage of those bombs

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.000
do you think actually landed

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:52.000
inside the 700-acre
perimeter of the plant?

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:55.000
10 percent. 10 percent.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.000
And of those 10 percent that landed,

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:00.000
16 percent didn't even go off;
they were duds.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000
The Leuna chemical plant,

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:05.000
after one of the most extensive
bombings in the history of the war,

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:08.000
was up and running within weeks.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.000
And by the way, all those precautions

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:13.000
to keep the Norden bombsight
out of the hands of the Nazis?

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.000
Well it turns out

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.000
that Carl Norden, as a proper Swiss,

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:20.000
was very enamored of German engineers.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.000
So in the 1930s,
he hired a whole bunch of them,

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.000
including a man named Hermann Long

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.000
who, in 1938,

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:29.000
gave a complete set of the plans
for the Norden bombsight to the Nazis.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:32.000
So they had their own Norden bombsight
throughout the entire war --

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:35.000
which also, by the way,
didn't work very well.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.000
(Laughter)

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:40.000
So why do we talk about
the Norden bombsight?

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.000
Well because we live in an age

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:44.000
where there are lots and lots

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.000
of Norden bombsights.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.000
We live in a time
where there are all kinds

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.000
of really, really smart people

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.000
running around, saying
that they've invented gadgets

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.000
that will forever change our world.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:57.000
They've invented websites
that will allow people to be free.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:01.000
They've invented some kind of this thing,
or this thing, or this thing

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:04.000
that will make our world forever better.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.000
If you go into the military,

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.000
you'll find lots of Carl Nordens as well.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.000
If you go to the Pentagon, they will say,

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.000
"You know what, now we really can

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.000
put a bomb inside a pickle barrel

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.000
at 20,000 ft."

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:19.000
And you know what, it's true;
they actually can do that now.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.000
But we need to be very clear

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:24.000
about how little that means.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:27.000
In the Iraq War, at the beginning
of the first Iraq War,

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.000
the U.S. military, the air force,

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:32.000
sent two squadrons
of F-15E Fighter Eagles

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.000
to the Iraqi desert

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.000
equipped with these
five million dollar cameras

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:39.000
that allowed them to see
the entire desert floor.

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:42.000
And their mission was
to find and to destroy --

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.000
remember the Scud missile launchers,

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.000
those surface-to-air missiles

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.000
that the Iraqis were launching
at the Israelis?

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.000
The mission of the two squadrons

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:53.000
was to get rid of all the
Scud missile launchers.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.000
And so they flew missions day and night,

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.000
and they dropped thousands of bombs,

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:00.000
and they fired thousands of missiles

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:03.000
in an attempt to get rid
of this particular scourge.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:05.000
And after the war was over,
there was an audit done --

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:07.000
as the army always does,
the air force always does --

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.000
and they asked the question:

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.000
how many Scuds did we actually destroy?

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.000
You know what the answer was?

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.000
Zero, not a single one.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.000
Now why is that?

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.000
Is it because their weapons
weren't accurate?

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:22.000
Oh no, they were brilliantly accurate.

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.000
They could have destroyed
this little thing right here

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.000
from 25,000 ft.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:30.000
The issue was they didn't know
where the Scud launchers were.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:33.000
The problem with bombs and pickle barrels

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.000
is not getting the bomb
inside the pickle barrel,

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:38.000
it's knowing how to
find the pickle barrel.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.000
That's always been the harder problem

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:42.000
when it comes to fighting wars.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:45.000
Or take the battle in Afghanistan.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:47.000
What is the signature weapon

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.000
of the CIA's war in Northwest Pakistan?

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:52.000
It's the drone. What is the drone?

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:56.000
Well it is the grandson
of the Norden Mark 15 bombsight.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:00.000
It is this weapon of devastating
accuracy and precision.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.000
And over the course of the last six years

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:05.000
in Northwest Pakistan,

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:08.000
the CIA has flown hundreds
of drone missiles,

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.000
and it's used those drones

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.000
to kill 2,000 suspected

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:16.000
Pakistani and Taliban militants.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:19.000
Now what is the accuracy of those drones?

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:21.000
Well it's extraordinary.

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:24.000
We think we're now at 95 percent accuracy

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:26.000
when it comes to drone strikes.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:29.000
95 percent of the people
we kill need to be killed, right?

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:31.000
That is one of the most
extraordinary records

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:33.000
in the history of modern warfare.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:35.000
But do you know what the crucial thing is?

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:37.000
In that exact same period

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.000
that we've been using these drones

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:41.000
with devastating accuracy,

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:44.000
the number of attacks, of suicide attacks
and terrorist attacks,

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:46.000
against American forces in Afghanistan

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:49.000
has increased tenfold.

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:51.000
As we have gotten more and more efficient

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.000
in killing them,

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:56.000
they have become angrier and angrier

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:59.000
and more and more motivated to kill us.

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:02.000
I have not described
to you a success story.

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:04.000
I've described to you

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:06.000
the opposite of a success story.

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.000
And this is the problem

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:10.000
with our infatuation
with the things we make.

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:13.000
We think the things
we make can solve our problems,

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:16.000
but our problems are much
more complex than that.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:19.000
The issue isn't the accuracy
of the bombs you have,

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:21.000
it's how you use the bombs you have,

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.000
and more importantly,

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:26.000
whether you ought to use bombs at all.

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:29.000
There's a postscript

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:31.000
to the Norden story

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:34.000
of Carl Norden and his fabulous bombsight.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:37.000
And that is, on August 6, 1945,

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:40.000
a B-29 bomber called the Enola Gay

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:42.000
flew over Japan

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.000
and, using a Norden bombsight,

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:47.000
dropped a very large thermonuclear device

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:50.000
on the city of Hiroshima.

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:53.000
And as was typical
with the Norden bombsight,

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:56.000
the bomb actually
missed its target by 800 ft.

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:59.000
But of course, it didn't matter.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:01.000
And that's the greatest irony of all

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:04.000
when it comes to the Norden bombsight.

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:08.000
the air force's 1.5 billion
dollar bombsight

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:12.000
was used to drop
its three billion dollar bomb,

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:15.000
which didn't need a bombsight at all.

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:17.000
Meanwhile, back in New York,

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:19.000
no one told Carl Norden

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:22.000
that his bombsight was used
over Hiroshima.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:24.000
He was a committed Christian.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.000
He thought he had designed something

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:29.000
that would reduce the toll
of suffering in war.

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:32.000
It would have broken his heart.

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:39.000
(Applause)
