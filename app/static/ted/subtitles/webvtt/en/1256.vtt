WEBVTT

00:00:00.968 --> 00:00:04.261
I moved to Boston
10 years ago from Chicago,

00:00:04.285 --> 00:00:06.880
with an interest in cancer
and in chemistry.

00:00:07.373 --> 00:00:10.668
You might know that chemistry
is the science of making molecules

00:00:10.692 --> 00:00:12.008
or, to my taste,

00:00:12.032 --> 00:00:13.663
new drugs for cancer.

00:00:14.179 --> 00:00:16.976
And you might also know that,
for science and medicine,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.408
Boston is a bit of a candy store.

00:00:20.507 --> 00:00:25.130
You can't roll a stop sign in Cambridge
without hitting a graduate student.

00:00:25.154 --> 00:00:27.329
The bar is called the Miracle of Science.

00:00:27.733 --> 00:00:30.595
The billboards say "Lab Space Available."

00:00:31.396 --> 00:00:33.555
And it's fair to say
that in these 10 years,

00:00:33.579 --> 00:00:37.886
we've witnessed absolutely the start
of a scientific revolution --

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:39.389
that of genome medicine.

00:00:39.775 --> 00:00:42.505
We know more about the patients
that enter our clinic now

00:00:42.529 --> 00:00:43.688
than ever before.

00:00:43.712 --> 00:00:45.936
And we're able, finally,
to answer the question

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.324
that's been so pressing for so many years:

00:00:48.348 --> 00:00:50.304
Why do I have cancer?

00:00:51.415 --> 00:00:53.536
This information
is also pretty staggering.

00:00:53.955 --> 00:00:57.048
You might know that, so far,
in just the dawn of this revolution,

00:00:57.072 --> 00:01:00.798
we know that there are perhaps
40,000 unique mutations

00:01:00.822 --> 00:01:03.433
affecting more than 10,000 genes,

00:01:03.457 --> 00:01:06.820
and that there are 500 of these genes
that are bona-fide drivers,

00:01:06.844 --> 00:01:08.740
causes of cancer.

00:01:09.834 --> 00:01:11.029
Yet comparatively,

00:01:11.053 --> 00:01:13.815
we have about a dozen
targeted medications.

00:01:14.712 --> 00:01:16.974
And this inadequacy of cancer medicine

00:01:16.998 --> 00:01:21.108
really hit home when my father
was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer.

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:24.611
We didn't fly him to Boston.

00:01:24.635 --> 00:01:26.166
We didn't sequence his genome.

00:01:26.547 --> 00:01:29.689
It's been known for decades
what causes this malignancy.

00:01:31.103 --> 00:01:35.150
It's three proteins: ras, myc, p53.

00:01:35.677 --> 00:01:38.375
This is old information
we've known since about the 80s,

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:40.319
yet there's no medicine I can prescribe

00:01:40.343 --> 00:01:43.906
to a patient with this
or any of the numerous solid tumors

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:45.622
caused by these three ...

00:01:46.581 --> 00:01:48.890
Horsemen of the Apocalypse that is cancer.

00:01:49.279 --> 00:01:51.715
There's no ras, no myc, no p53 drug.

00:01:52.096 --> 00:01:54.350
And you might fairly ask: Why is that?

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:57.882
And the very unsatisfying
yet scientific answer is:

00:01:57.906 --> 00:01:59.064
it's too hard.

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:00.890
That for whatever reason,

00:02:00.914 --> 00:02:04.407
these three proteins have entered
a space, in the language of our field,

00:02:04.431 --> 00:02:06.631
that's called the undruggable genome --

00:02:06.655 --> 00:02:08.945
which is like calling
a computer unsurfable

00:02:08.969 --> 00:02:10.225
or the Moon unwalkable.

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:12.357
It's a horrible term of trade.

00:02:12.381 --> 00:02:13.539
But what it means

00:02:13.563 --> 00:02:16.785
is that we've failed to identify
a greasy pocket in these proteins,

00:02:16.809 --> 00:02:19.079
into which we, like molecular locksmiths,

00:02:19.103 --> 00:02:24.195
can fashion an active, small,
organic molecule or drug substance.

00:02:24.774 --> 00:02:27.207
Now, as I was training
in clinical medicine

00:02:27.231 --> 00:02:30.692
and hematology and oncology
and stem-cell transplantation,

00:02:30.716 --> 00:02:32.589
what we had instead,

00:02:32.613 --> 00:02:36.128
cascading through the regulatory
network at the FDA,

00:02:36.152 --> 00:02:37.585
were these substances:

00:02:37.609 --> 00:02:38.918
arsenic,

00:02:38.942 --> 00:02:40.107
thalidomide,

00:02:40.131 --> 00:02:43.488
and this chemical derivative
of nitrogen mustard gas.

00:02:43.512 --> 00:02:46.121
And this is the 21st century.

00:02:46.145 --> 00:02:47.391
And so, I guess you'd say,

00:02:47.415 --> 00:02:50.552
dissatisfied with the performance
and quality of these medicines,

00:02:50.576 --> 00:02:52.849
I went back to school, in chemistry,

00:02:54.049 --> 00:02:58.708
with the idea that perhaps by learning
the trade of discovery chemistry

00:02:58.732 --> 00:03:01.605
and approaching it in the context
of this brave new world

00:03:01.629 --> 00:03:03.841
of the open source,

00:03:03.865 --> 00:03:05.293
the crowd source,

00:03:05.317 --> 00:03:08.622
the collaborative network
that we have access to within academia,

00:03:08.646 --> 00:03:12.924
that we might more quickly bring
powerful and targeted therapies

00:03:12.948 --> 00:03:14.310
to our patients.

00:03:14.691 --> 00:03:17.791
And so, please consider
this a work in progress,

00:03:17.815 --> 00:03:19.832
but I'd like to tell you today a story

00:03:19.856 --> 00:03:23.057
about a very rare cancer
called midline carcinoma,

00:03:23.859 --> 00:03:28.073
about the undruggable protein target
that causes this cancer,

00:03:28.097 --> 00:03:29.625
called BRD4,

00:03:29.649 --> 00:03:33.494
and about a molecule developed at my lab
at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute,

00:03:33.518 --> 00:03:34.670
called JQ1,

00:03:34.694 --> 00:03:36.916
which we affectionately named for Jun Qi,

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:38.979
the chemist that made this molecule.

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:42.405
Now, BRD4 is an interesting protein.

00:03:42.429 --> 00:03:46.110
You might ask: with all the things
cancer's trying to do to kill our patient,

00:03:46.134 --> 00:03:47.722
how does it remember it's cancer?

00:03:47.746 --> 00:03:49.177
When it winds up its genome,

00:03:49.201 --> 00:03:51.572
divides into two cells and unwinds again,

00:03:51.596 --> 00:03:53.833
why does it not turn
into an eye, into a liver,

00:03:53.857 --> 00:03:56.238
as it has all the genes
necessary to do this?

00:03:56.262 --> 00:03:57.824
It remembers that it's cancer.

00:03:58.688 --> 00:04:01.776
And the reason is that cancer,
like every cell in the body,

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:03.776
places little molecular bookmarks,

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:05.178
little Post-it notes,

00:04:05.202 --> 00:04:08.185
that remind the cell, "I'm cancer;
I should keep growing."

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:12.813
And those Post-it notes involve this
and other proteins of its class --

00:04:12.837 --> 00:04:14.153
so-called bromodomains.

00:04:14.732 --> 00:04:17.400
So we developed an idea, a rationale,

00:04:17.424 --> 00:04:19.573
that perhaps if we made a molecule

00:04:19.597 --> 00:04:21.890
that prevented
the Post-it note from sticking

00:04:21.914 --> 00:04:23.573
by entering into the little pocket

00:04:23.597 --> 00:04:25.453
at the base of this spinning protein,

00:04:25.477 --> 00:04:27.533
then maybe we could convince cancer cells,

00:04:27.557 --> 00:04:30.358
certainly those addicted
to this BRD4 protein,

00:04:30.382 --> 00:04:31.699
that they're not cancer.

00:04:32.418 --> 00:04:34.641
And so we started to work on this problem.

00:04:34.665 --> 00:04:36.967
We developed libraries of compounds

00:04:36.991 --> 00:04:39.776
and eventually arrived
at this and similar substances

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:40.982
called JQ1.

00:04:41.577 --> 00:04:43.141
Now, not being a drug company,

00:04:43.165 --> 00:04:46.259
we could do certain things,
we had certain flexibilities,

00:04:46.283 --> 00:04:49.117
that I respect that a pharmaceutical
industry doesn't have.

00:04:49.141 --> 00:04:51.391
We just started mailing it to our friends.

00:04:51.883 --> 00:04:53.036
I have a small lab.

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:56.465
We thought we'd just send it to people
and see how the molecule behaves.

00:04:56.489 --> 00:04:57.939
We sent it to Oxford, England,

00:04:57.963 --> 00:05:01.185
where a group of talented
crystallographers provided this picture,

00:05:01.209 --> 00:05:04.306
which helped us understand exactly
how this molecule is so potent

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:05.496
for this protein target.

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:08.456
It's what we call a perfect fit
of shape complementarity,

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:09.630
or hand in glove.

00:05:10.327 --> 00:05:11.948
Now, this is a very rare cancer,

00:05:11.972 --> 00:05:13.776
this BRD4-addicted cancer.

00:05:14.201 --> 00:05:16.432
And so we worked with samples of material

00:05:16.456 --> 00:05:20.030
that were collected by young pathologists
at Brigham and Women's Hospital.

00:05:20.054 --> 00:05:22.427
And as we treated these cells
with this molecule,

00:05:22.451 --> 00:05:24.490
we observed something really striking.

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:26.006
The cancer cells --

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:28.097
small, round and rapidly dividing,

00:05:28.121 --> 00:05:30.474
grew these arms and extensions.

00:05:30.498 --> 00:05:31.862
They were changing shape.

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:33.647
In effect,

00:05:33.671 --> 00:05:36.978
the cancer cell
was forgetting it was cancer

00:05:37.002 --> 00:05:38.510
and becoming a normal cell.

00:05:40.076 --> 00:05:41.433
This got us very excited.

00:05:42.841 --> 00:05:45.429
The next step would be to put
this molecule into mice.

00:05:45.453 --> 00:05:48.848
The only problem was there's no
mouse model of this rare cancer.

00:05:48.872 --> 00:05:51.595
And so at the time
we were doing this research,

00:05:51.619 --> 00:05:55.192
I was caring for a 29-year-old
firefighter from Connecticut

00:05:55.216 --> 00:05:57.098
who was very much at the end of life

00:05:57.122 --> 00:05:58.978
with this incurable cancer.

00:05:59.621 --> 00:06:03.071
This BRD4-addicted cancer
was growing throughout his left lung.

00:06:03.095 --> 00:06:06.260
And he had a chest tube in
that was draining little bits of debris.

00:06:06.284 --> 00:06:09.245
And every nursing shift,
we would throw this material out.

00:06:09.269 --> 00:06:11.036
And so we approached this patient

00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:13.072
and asked if he would collaborate with us.

00:06:13.715 --> 00:06:17.414
Could we take this precious
and rare cancerous material

00:06:17.438 --> 00:06:19.037
from this chest tube

00:06:19.061 --> 00:06:21.280
and drive it across town
and put it into mice

00:06:21.304 --> 00:06:24.945
and try to do a clinical trial
at a stage that with a prototype drug,

00:06:24.969 --> 00:06:26.993
well, that would be, of course, impossible

00:06:27.017 --> 00:06:28.850
and, rightly, illegal to do in humans.

00:06:28.874 --> 00:06:30.127
And he obliged us.

00:06:31.006 --> 00:06:33.198
At the Lurie Family Center
for Animal Imaging,

00:06:33.222 --> 00:06:36.837
our colleague, Andrew Kung,
grew this cancer successfully in mice

00:06:36.861 --> 00:06:38.551
without ever touching plastic.

00:06:38.575 --> 00:06:41.991
And you can see this PET scan
of a mouse -- what we call a pet PET.

00:06:42.015 --> 00:06:43.571
The cancer is growing

00:06:43.595 --> 00:06:46.500
as this red, huge mass
in the hind limb of this animal.

00:06:46.921 --> 00:06:49.144
And as we treat it with our compound,

00:06:49.168 --> 00:06:50.776
this addiction to sugar,

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:52.391
this rapid growth, faded.

00:06:52.415 --> 00:06:54.458
And on the animal on the right,

00:06:54.482 --> 00:06:56.493
you see that the cancer was responding.

00:06:57.569 --> 00:06:59.776
We've completed, now, clinical trials

00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:01.776
in four mouse models of this disease.

00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:03.649
And every time, we see the same thing.

00:07:03.673 --> 00:07:06.378
The mice with this cancer
that get the drug live,

00:07:06.402 --> 00:07:08.698
and the ones that don't rapidly perish.

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:12.229
So we started to wonder,

00:07:12.253 --> 00:07:14.357
what would a drug company
do at this point?

00:07:14.381 --> 00:07:16.430
Well, they probably
would keep this a secret

00:07:16.454 --> 00:07:18.339
until they turn the prototype drug

00:07:18.363 --> 00:07:20.507
into an active pharmaceutical substance.

00:07:21.063 --> 00:07:22.504
So we did just the opposite.

00:07:22.884 --> 00:07:25.719
We published a paper
that described this finding

00:07:25.743 --> 00:07:27.719
at the earliest prototype stage.

00:07:28.513 --> 00:07:31.421
We gave the world the chemical
identity of this molecule,

00:07:31.445 --> 00:07:33.342
typically a secret in our discipline.

00:07:33.366 --> 00:07:35.342
We told people exactly how to make it.

00:07:36.039 --> 00:07:37.707
We gave them our email address,

00:07:37.731 --> 00:07:39.382
suggesting that if they write us,

00:07:39.406 --> 00:07:41.008
we'll send them a free molecule.

00:07:41.032 --> 00:07:42.120
(Laughter)

00:07:42.144 --> 00:07:45.041
We basically tried to create
the most competitive environment

00:07:45.065 --> 00:07:46.225
for our lab as possible.

00:07:46.249 --> 00:07:48.191
And this was, unfortunately, successful.

00:07:48.215 --> 00:07:49.239
(Laughter)

00:07:49.263 --> 00:07:51.268
Because now, we've shared this molecule,

00:07:51.292 --> 00:07:53.695
just since December of last year,

00:07:53.719 --> 00:07:55.974
with 40 laboratories in the United States

00:07:55.998 --> 00:07:57.776
and 30 more in Europe --

00:07:57.800 --> 00:07:59.649
many of them pharmaceutical companies,

00:07:59.673 --> 00:08:01.268
seeking now to enter this space,

00:08:01.292 --> 00:08:04.341
to target this rare cancer
that, thankfully right now,

00:08:05.196 --> 00:08:07.809
is quite desirable
to study in that industry.

00:08:10.062 --> 00:08:13.131
But the science that's coming back
from all of these laboratories

00:08:13.155 --> 00:08:14.989
about the use of this molecule

00:08:15.013 --> 00:08:18.186
has provided us insights
we might not have had on our own.

00:08:18.210 --> 00:08:20.187
Leukemia cells treated with this compound

00:08:20.211 --> 00:08:22.627
turn into normal white blood cells.

00:08:23.276 --> 00:08:25.057
Mice with multiple myeloma,

00:08:25.081 --> 00:08:28.116
an incurable malignancy
of the bone marrow,

00:08:28.140 --> 00:08:30.117
respond dramatically

00:08:30.141 --> 00:08:31.856
to the treatment with this drug.

00:08:32.316 --> 00:08:34.292
You might know that fat has memory.

00:08:35.364 --> 00:08:37.340
I'll nicely demonstrate that for you.

00:08:37.364 --> 00:08:38.395
(Laughter)

00:08:38.419 --> 00:08:39.971
In fact, this molecule

00:08:39.995 --> 00:08:43.395
prevents this adipocyte,
this fat stem cell,

00:08:43.419 --> 00:08:46.288
from remembering how to make fat,

00:08:46.312 --> 00:08:48.680
such that mice on a high-fat diet,

00:08:48.704 --> 00:08:50.818
like the folks
in my hometown of Chicago --

00:08:50.842 --> 00:08:51.850
(Laughter)

00:08:51.874 --> 00:08:53.882
fail to develop fatty liver,

00:08:53.906 --> 00:08:55.729
which is a major medical problem.

00:08:56.920 --> 00:08:58.492
What this research taught us --

00:08:58.516 --> 00:09:00.776
not just my lab, but our institute,

00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:02.872
and Harvard Medical School
more generally --

00:09:02.896 --> 00:09:05.157
is that we have unique
resources in academia

00:09:05.181 --> 00:09:06.515
for drug discovery;

00:09:06.539 --> 00:09:09.722
that our center, which has tested
perhaps more cancer molecules

00:09:09.746 --> 00:09:10.903
in a scientific way

00:09:10.927 --> 00:09:12.078
than any other,

00:09:12.102 --> 00:09:13.577
never made one of its own.

00:09:14.545 --> 00:09:16.712
For all the reasons you see listed here,

00:09:16.736 --> 00:09:19.475
we think there's a great
opportunity for academic centers

00:09:19.499 --> 00:09:23.323
to participate in this earliest,
conceptually tricky

00:09:23.347 --> 00:09:25.277
and creative discipline

00:09:25.301 --> 00:09:27.083
of prototype drug discovery.

00:09:29.872 --> 00:09:31.022
So what next?

00:09:31.349 --> 00:09:33.729
We have this molecule,
but it's not a pill yet.

00:09:33.753 --> 00:09:36.347
It's not orally bioavailable.

00:09:36.371 --> 00:09:39.566
We need to fix it so we can
deliver it to our patients.

00:09:39.590 --> 00:09:41.174
And everyone in the lab,

00:09:41.198 --> 00:09:43.999
especially following the interaction
with these patients,

00:09:44.023 --> 00:09:46.348
feels quite compelled
to deliver a drug substance

00:09:46.372 --> 00:09:47.570
based on this molecule.

00:09:47.594 --> 00:09:49.005
It's here where I'd say

00:09:49.029 --> 00:09:51.244
that we could use your help
and your insights,

00:09:51.268 --> 00:09:53.130
your collaborative participation.

00:09:53.481 --> 00:09:57.162
Unlike a drug company,
we don't have a pipeline

00:09:57.186 --> 00:09:59.193
that we can deposit these molecules into.

00:09:59.217 --> 00:10:01.614
We don't have a team
of salespeople and marketeers

00:10:01.638 --> 00:10:04.349
to tell us how to position
this drug against the other.

00:10:04.373 --> 00:10:07.041
What we do have is the flexibility
of an academic center

00:10:07.065 --> 00:10:09.417
to work with competent, motivated,

00:10:09.441 --> 00:10:12.346
enthusiastic, hopefully well-funded people

00:10:12.370 --> 00:10:14.663
to carry these molecules
forward into the clinic

00:10:14.687 --> 00:10:18.385
while preserving our ability
to share the prototype drug worldwide.

00:10:19.474 --> 00:10:22.115
This molecule will soon leave our benches

00:10:22.139 --> 00:10:25.189
and go into a small start-up company
called Tensha Therapeutics.

00:10:25.213 --> 00:10:28.149
And, really, this is the fourth
of these molecules

00:10:28.173 --> 00:10:30.420
to kind of "graduate"
from our little pipeline

00:10:30.444 --> 00:10:31.898
of drug discovery,

00:10:31.922 --> 00:10:36.278
two of which -- a topical drug
for lymphoma of the skin

00:10:37.197 --> 00:10:40.308
and an oral substance for the treatment
of multiple myeloma --

00:10:40.332 --> 00:10:43.570
will actually come to the bedside
for the first clinical trial

00:10:43.594 --> 00:10:47.117
in July of this year -- for us,
a major and exciting milestone.

00:10:48.649 --> 00:10:50.672
I want to leave you with just two ideas.

00:10:50.696 --> 00:10:55.030
The first is: if anything is unique
about this research,

00:10:55.054 --> 00:10:57.411
it's less the science than the strategy.

00:10:57.435 --> 00:10:59.857
This, for us, was a social experiment --

00:10:59.881 --> 00:11:05.146
an experiment in "What would happen
if we were as open and honest

00:11:05.170 --> 00:11:07.686
at the earliest phase
of discovery chemistry research

00:11:07.710 --> 00:11:09.157
as we could be?"

00:11:09.181 --> 00:11:11.522
This string of letters and numbers

00:11:11.546 --> 00:11:13.561
and symbols and parentheses

00:11:13.585 --> 00:11:15.204
that can be texted, I suppose,

00:11:15.228 --> 00:11:16.655
or Twittered worldwide,

00:11:17.948 --> 00:11:20.450
is the chemical identity
of our pro compound.

00:11:20.474 --> 00:11:24.556
It's the information that we most need
from pharmaceutical companies,

00:11:24.580 --> 00:11:29.294
the information on how these early
prototype drugs might work.

00:11:29.688 --> 00:11:31.812
Yet this information is largely a secret.

00:11:32.482 --> 00:11:35.361
And so we seek, really, to download

00:11:35.385 --> 00:11:38.504
from the amazing successes
of the computer-science industry,

00:11:38.528 --> 00:11:42.907
two principles -- that of open source
and that of crowdsourcing --

00:11:42.931 --> 00:11:48.925
to quickly, responsibly accelerate
the delivery of targeted therapeutics

00:11:48.949 --> 00:11:50.456
to patients with cancer.

00:11:51.117 --> 00:11:54.236
Now, the business model
involves all of you.

00:11:54.260 --> 00:11:56.236
This research is funded by the public.

00:11:56.585 --> 00:11:57.963
It's funded by foundations.

00:11:57.987 --> 00:11:59.717
And one thing I've learned in Boston

00:11:59.741 --> 00:12:02.815
is that you people will do anything
for cancer, and I love that.

00:12:02.839 --> 00:12:05.736
You bike across the state,
you walk up and down the river.

00:12:05.760 --> 00:12:07.300
(Laughter)

00:12:07.890 --> 00:12:10.216
I've never seen, really, anywhere,

00:12:10.240 --> 00:12:13.483
this unique support for cancer research.

00:12:13.507 --> 00:12:15.264
And so I want to thank you

00:12:15.288 --> 00:12:18.585
for your participation, your collaboration

00:12:18.609 --> 00:12:19.770
and most of all,

00:12:19.794 --> 00:12:21.728
for your confidence in our ideas.

00:12:21.752 --> 00:12:27.253
(Applause)
