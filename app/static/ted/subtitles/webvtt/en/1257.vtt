00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:09.000
(Applause)

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
(Applause)

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
I am a papercutter.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
(Laughter)

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
I cut stories.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
So my process is very straightforward.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
I take a piece of paper,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
I visualize my story,

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
sometimes I sketch, sometimes I don't.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
And as my image

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
is already inside the paper,

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
I just have to remove

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
what's not from that story.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
So I didn't come to papercutting

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
in a straight line.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
In fact,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
I see it more as a spiral.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
I was not born

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
with a blade in my hand.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
And I don't remember papercutting as a child.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
As a teenager,

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
I was sketching, drawing,

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
and I wanted to be an artist.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.000
But I was also a rebel.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
And I left everything

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.000
and went for a long series of odd jobs.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
So among them,

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
I have been a shepherdess,

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
a truck driver,

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
a factory worker,

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
a cleaning lady.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
I worked in tourism for one year

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
in Mexico,

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
one year in Egypt.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
I moved for two years

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
in Taiwan.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
And then I settled in New York

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
where I became a tour guide.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
And I still worked as a tour leader,

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
traveled back and forth

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
in China, Tibet and Central Asia.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
So of course, it took time, and I was nearly 40,

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
and I decided it's time

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000
to start as an artist.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.000
(Applause)

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
I chose papercutting

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
because paper is cheap,

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
it's light,

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
and you can use it

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
in a lot of different ways.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.000
And I chose the language of silhouette

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000
because graphically it's very efficient.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:40.000
And it's also just getting to the essential of things.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
So the word "silhouette"

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
comes from a minister of finance,

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000
Etienne de Silhouette.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.000
And he slashed so many budgets

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
that people said they couldn't afford

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
paintings anymore,

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
and they needed to have their portrait

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
"a la silhouette."

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
(Laughter)

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:08.000
So I made series of images, cuttings,

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:13.000
and I assembled them in portfolios.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
And people told me --

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000
like these 36 views of the Empire State building --

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.000
they told me, "You're making artist books."

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.000
So artist books have a lot of definitions.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.000
They come in a lot of different shapes.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
But to me,

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
they are fascinating objects

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000
to visually narrate a story.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000
They can be with words

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.000
or without words.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000
And I have a passion

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000
for images and for words.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000
I love pun

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.000
and the relation to the unconscious.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.000
I love oddities of languages.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000
And everywhere I lived, I learned the languages,

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000
but never mastered them.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
So I'm always looking

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
for the false cognates

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.000
or identical words in different languages.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.000
So as you can guess, my mother tongue is French.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.000
And my daily language is English.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000
So I did a series of work

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.000
where it was identical words

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.000
in French and in English.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000
So one of these works

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000
is the "Spelling Spider."

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.000
So the Spelling Spider

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.000
is a cousin of the spelling bee.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
(Laughter)

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000
But it's much more connected to the Web.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000
(Laughter)

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000
And this spider

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.000
spins a bilingual alphabet.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.000
So you can read "architecture active"

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.000
or "active architecture."

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.000
So this spider goes through the whole alphabet

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:54.000
with identical adjectives and substantives.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000
So if you don't know one of these languages,

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000
it's instant learning.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.000
And one ancient form of the book

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000
is scrolls.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000
So scrolls are very convenient,

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.000
because you can create a large image

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.000
on a very small table.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:20.000
So the unexpected consequences of that

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:25.000
is that you only see one part of your image,

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:29.000
so it makes a very freestyle architecture.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:33.000
And I'm making all those kinds of windows.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.000
So it's to look beyond the surface.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.000
It's to have a look

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000
at different worlds.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000
And very often I've been an outsider.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.000
So I want to see how things work

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000
and what's happening.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.000
So each window

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000
is an image

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000
and is a world

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.000
that I often revisit.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000
And I revisit this world

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.000
thinking about the image

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.000
or clichÃ© about what we want to do,

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.000
and what are the words, colloquialisms,

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.000
that we have with the expressions.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.000
It's all if.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:15.000
So what if we were living in balloon houses?

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:19.000
It would make a very uplifting world.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:24.000
And we would leave a very low footprint on the planet.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.000
It would be so light.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:32.000
So sometimes I view from the inside,

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000
like EgoCentriCity

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.000
and the inner circles.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:40.000
Sometimes it's a global view,

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:43.000
to see our common roots

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:47.000
and how we can use them to catch dreams.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000
And we can use them also

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000
as a safety net.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.000
And my inspirations

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.000
are very eclectic.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:01.000
I'm influenced by everything I read,

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:04.000
everything I see.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:07.000
I have some stories that are humorous,

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:10.000
like "Dead Beats."

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.000
(Laughter)

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000
Other ones are historical.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.000
Here it's "CandyCity."

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.000
It's a non-sugar-coated

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.000
history of sugar.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.000
It goes from slave trade

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.000
to over-consumption of sugar

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:31.000
with some sweet moments in between.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:34.000
And sometimes I have an emotional response to news,

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:38.000
such as the 2010 Haitian earthquake.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.000
Other times, it's not even my stories.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.000
People tell me their lives,

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.000
their memories, their aspirations,

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:51.000
and I create a mindscape.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:54.000
I channel their history

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.000
[so that] they have a place to go back

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:01.000
to look at their life and its possibilities.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:05.000
I call them Freudian cities.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.000
I cannot speak for all my images,

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:11.000
so I'll just go through a few of my worlds

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.000
just with the title.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:16.000
"ModiCity."

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:20.000
"ElectriCity."

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:26.000
"MAD Growth on Columbus Circle."

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.000
"ReefCity."

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:38.000
"A Web of Time."

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:43.000
"Chaos City."

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:48.000
"Daily Battles."

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.000
"FeliCity."

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:57.000
"Floating Islands."

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.000
And at one point,

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.000
I had to do "The Whole Nine Yards."

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:06.000
So it's actually a papercut that's nine yards long.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.000
(Laughter)

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.000
So in life and in papercutting,

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.000
everything is connected.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.000
One story leads to another.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.000
I was also interested

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.000
in the physicality of this format,

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:22.000
because you have to walk to see it.

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.000
And parallel to my cutting

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.000
is my running.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.000
I started with small images,

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.000
I started with a few miles.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:33.000
Larger images, I started to run marathons.

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:36.000
Then I went to run 50K, then 60K.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:41.000
Then I ran 50 miles -- ultramarathons.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:44.000
And I still feel I'm running,

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.000
it's just the training

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:49.000
to become a long-distance papercutter.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.000
(Laughter)

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:55.000
And running gives me a lot of energy.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:58.000
Here is a three-week papercutting marathon

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:01.000
at the Museum of Arts and Design

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.000
in New York City.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:07.000
The result is "Hells and Heavens."

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:10.000
It's two panels 13 ft. high.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:13.000
They were installed in the museum on two floors,

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.000
but in fact, it's a continuous image.

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:18.000
And I call it "Hells and Heavens"

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:22.000
because it's daily hells and daily heavens.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.000
There is no border in between.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.000
Some people are born in hells,

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:29.000
and against all odds, they make it to heavens.

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.000
Other people make the opposite trip.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:33.000
That's the border.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.000
You have sweatshops in hells.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:38.000
You have people renting their wings in the heavens.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:41.000
And then you have all those individual stories

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:45.000
where sometimes we even have the same action,

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:50.000
and the result puts you in hells or in heavens.

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.000
So the whole "Hells and Heavens"

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:55.000
is about free will

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.000
and determinism.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.000
And in papercutting,

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:03.000
you have the drawing as the structure itself.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:06.000
So you can take it off the wall.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:10.000
Here it's an artist book installation

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:13.000
called "Identity Project."

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:17.000
It's not autobiographical identities.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:21.000
They are more our social identities.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.000
And then you can just walk behind them

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.000
and try them on.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.000
So it's like the different layers

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.000
of what we are made of

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.000
and what we present to the world

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:33.000
as an identity.

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:36.000
That's another artist book project.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:40.000
In fact, in the picture, you have two of them.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:42.000
It's one I'm wearing

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:44.000
and one that's on exhibition

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:46.000
at the Center for Books Arts in New York City.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.000
Why do I call it a book?

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.000
It's called "Fashion Statement,"

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.000
and there are quotes about fashion,

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.000
so you can read it,

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.000
and also,

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:59.000
because the definition of artist book

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:02.000
is very generous.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.000
So artist books, you take them off the wall.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.000
You take them for a walk.

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:09.000
You can also install them as public art.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:12.000
Here it's in Scottsdale, Arizona,

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:15.000
and it's called "Floating Memories."

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:18.000
So it's regional memories,

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:21.000
and they are just randomly moved by the wind.

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:25.000
I love public art.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:28.000
And I entered competitions

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.000
for a long time.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:33.000
After eight years of rejection,

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:36.000
I was thrilled to get my first commission

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:39.000
with the Percent for Art in New York City.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:42.000
It was for a merger station

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:45.000
for emergency workers and firemen.

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:48.000
I made an artist book

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.000
that's in stainless steel

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:52.000
instead of paper.

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:56.000
I called it "Working in the Same Direction."

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.000
But I added weathervanes on both sides

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:02.000
to show that they cover all directions.

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:04.000
With public art,

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:07.000
I could also make cut glass.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:10.000
Here it's faceted glass in the Bronx.

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.000
And each time I make public art,

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.000
I want something that's really relevant

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.000
to the place it's installed.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.000
So for the subway in New York,

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:21.000
I saw a correspondence

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:24.000
between riding the subway

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.000
and reading.

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:29.000
It is travel in time, travel on time.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:31.000
And Bronx literature,

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.000
it's all about Bronx writers

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:35.000
and their stories.

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:39.000
Another glass project

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:41.000
is in a public library

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:44.000
in San Jose, California.

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:47.000
So I made a vegetable point of view

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:49.000
of the growth of San Jose.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:51.000
So I started in the center

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:53.000
with the acorn

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:57.000
for the Ohlone Indian civilization.

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:59.000
Then I have the fruit from Europe

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:01.000
for the ranchers.

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:04.000
And then the fruit of the world for Silicon Valley today.

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:06.000
And it's still growing.

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:09.000
So the technique, it's cut,

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:11.000
sandblasted, etched

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:15.000
and printed glass into architectural glass.

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:17.000
And outside the library,

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:21.000
I wanted to make a place to cultivate your mind.

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:24.000
I took library material

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:27.000
that had fruit in their title

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:30.000
and I used them to make an orchard walk

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.000
with these fruits of knowledge.

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:35.000
I also planted the bibliotree.

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:37.000
So it's a tree,

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:40.000
and in its trunk you have the roots of languages.

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:44.000
And it's all about international writing systems.

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.000
And on the branches

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:49.000
you have library material growing.

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:53.000
You can also have function and form

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:55.000
with public art.

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:57.000
So in Aurora, Colorado it's a bench.

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:00.000
But you have a bonus with this bench.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:03.000
Because if you sit a long time in summer in shorts,

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:05.000
you will walk away

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:08.000
with temporary branding of

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:10.000
the story element on your thighs.

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:13.000
(Laughter)

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:17.000
Another functional work,

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:19.000
it's in the south side of Chicago

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:21.000
for a subway station.

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:25.000
And it's called "Seeds of the Future are Planted Today."

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:28.000
It's a story about transformation

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:30.000
and connections.

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:32.000
So it acts as a screen

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:35.000
to protect the rail and the commuter,

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:38.000
and not to have objects falling on the rails.

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:41.000
To be able to change fences

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:44.000
and window guards into flowers,

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:46.000
it's fantastic.

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:49.000
And here I've been working for the last three years

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:51.000
with a South Bronx developer

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:53.000
to bring art to life

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:55.000
to low-income buildings

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:58.000
and affordable housing.

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:01.000
So each building has its own personality.

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:05.000
And sometimes it's about a legacy of the neighborhood,

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:09.000
like in Morrisania, about the jazz history.

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:12.000
And for other projects, like in Paris,

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:14.000
it's about the name of the street.

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:17.000
It's called Rue des Prairies -- Prairie Street.

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:19.000
So I brought back the rabbit,

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:21.000
the dragonfly,

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:23.000
to stay in that street.

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:25.000
And in 2009,

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:28.000
I was asked to make a poster

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:31.000
to be placed in the subway cars in New York City

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:33.000
for a year.

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:37.000
So that was a very captive audience.

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:41.000
And I wanted to give them an escape.

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:44.000
I created "All Around Town."

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:46.000
It is a papercutting,

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:49.000
and then after, I added color on the computer.

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:52.000
So I can call it techno-crafted.

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:54.000
And along the way,

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:57.000
I'm kind of making papercuttings

00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:59.000
and adding other techniques.

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:02.000
But the result is always to have stories.

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:05.000
So the stories, they have a lot of possibilities.

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:07.000
They have a lot of scenarios.

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:09.000
I don't know the stories.

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:13.000
I take images from our global imagination,

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:15.000
from clichÃ©, from things we are thinking about,

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:17.000
from history.

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:19.000
And everybody's a narrator,

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:22.000
because everybody has a story to tell.

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:24.000
But more important

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:26.000
is everybody has to make a story

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:28.000
to make sense of the world.

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:30.000
And in all these universes,

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:33.000
it's like imagination is the vehicle

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:35.000
to be transported with,

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:38.000
but the destination is our minds

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:40.000
and how we can reconnect

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:42.000
with the essential and with the magic.

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:45.000
And it's what story cutting is all about.

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:54.000
(Applause)
