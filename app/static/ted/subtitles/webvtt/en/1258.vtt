00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Hi there. I'm Hasan. I'm an artist.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
And usually when I tell people I'm an artist,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
they just look at me and say, "Do you paint?"

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
or "What kind of medium do you work in?"

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Well most of my work that I work with

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
is really a little bit about methodologies of working

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
rather than actually a specific discipline

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
or a specific technique.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
So what I'm really interested in is creative problem solving.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
And I had a little bit of a problem a few years ago.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
So let me show you a little of that.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
So it started over here.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
And this is the Detroit airport in June 19th of 2002.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
I was flying back to the U.S. from an exhibition overseas.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
And as I was coming back,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
well I was taken by the FBI, met by an FBI agent,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
and went into a little room

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
and he asked me all sorts of questions --

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
"Where were you? What were you doing? Who were you talking with?

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
Why were you there? Who pays for your trips?" --

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
all these little details.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
And then literally just out of nowhere,

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
the guy asks me, "Where were you September 12th?"

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
And when most of us get asked, "Where were you September 12th?"

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
or any date for that fact,

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
it's like, "I don't exactly remember, but I can look it up for you."

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
So I pulled out my little PDA,

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
and I said, "Okay, let's look up my appointments for September 12th."

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
I had September 12th -- from 10:00 a.m. to 10:30 a.m., I paid my storage bill.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
From 10:30 a.m. to 12:00 p.m., I met with Judith who was one of my graduate students at the time.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
From 12:00 p.m. to 3:00 p.m., I taught my intro class,

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
3:00 p.m. to 6:00 p.m., I taught my advanced class.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
"Where were you the 11th?" "Where were you the 10th?"

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
"Where were you the 29th? the 30th?"

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
"Where were you October 5th?"

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
We read about six months of my calendar.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
And I don't think he was expecting me to have such detailed records

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
of what I did.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
But good thing I did,

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
because I don't look good in orange.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
(Laughter)

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
So he asked me --

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
(Applause)

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
"So this storage unit that you paid the rent on,

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
what did you have in it?"

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
This was in Tampa, Florida,

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
so I was like, "Winter clothes that I have no use for in Florida.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
Furniture that I can't fit in my ratty apartment.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000
Just assorted garage sale junk,

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
because I'm a pack rat."

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
And he looks at me really confused and says, "No explosives?"

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
(Laughter)

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
I was like, "No, no. I'm pretty certain there were no explosives.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000
And if there were, I would have remembered that one."

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
And he's still a little confused,

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
but I think that anyone who talks to me for more than a couple of minutes

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
realizes I'm not exactly a terrorist threat.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
And so we're sitting there,

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.000
and eventually after about an hour, hour and a half of just going back and forth,

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
he says, "Okay, I have enough information here.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
I'm going to pass this onto the Tampa office. They're the ones who initiated this.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
They'll follow up with you, and we'll take care of it."

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
I was like, "Great."

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
So I got home and the phone rings,

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
and a man introduced himself.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000
Basically this is the FBI offices in Tampa

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
where I spent six months of my life --

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
back and forth, not six months continuously.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
By the way, you folks know that in the United States,

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
you can't take photographs of federal buildings,

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
but Google can do it for you.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
So to the folks from Google, thank you.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000
(Applause)

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
So I spent a lot of time in this building.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
Questions like:

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
"Have you ever witnessed or participated in any act

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.000
that may be detrimental to the United States or a foreign nation?"

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
And you also have to consider the state of mind you're in

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
when you're doing this.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000
You're basically face-to-face with someone

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000
that essentially decides life or death.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000
Or questions such as -- actually, during the polygraph,

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000
which was how it finally ended after nine consecutive of them --

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000
one of the polygraph questions was ...

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.000
well the first one was, "Is your name Hasan?" "Yes."

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.000
"Are we in Florida?" "Yes." "Is today Tuesday?" "Yes."

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
Because you have to base it on a yes or no.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000
Then, of course, the next question is:

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000
"Do you belong to any groups that wish to harm the United States?"

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000
I work at a university.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000
(Laughter)

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.000
So I was like, "Maybe you want to ask some of my colleagues that directly."

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000
But they said, "Okay, aside from what we had discussed,

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000
do you belong to any groups that wish to harm the United States?"

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000
I was like, "No."

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000
So at the end of six months of this

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000
and nine consecutive polygraphs,

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000
they said, "Hey, everything's fine."

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
I was like, "I know. That's what I've been trying to tell you guys all along.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
I know everything's fine."

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.000
So they're looking at me really odd.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000
And it's like, "Guys, I travel a lot."

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000
This is with the FBI.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000
And I was like, "All we need is Alaska not to get the last memo,

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000
and here we go all over again."

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000
And there was a sincere concern there.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000
And he was like, "You know, if you get into trouble,

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000
give us a call -- we'll take care of it."

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.000
So ever since then, before I would go anywhere, I would call the FBI.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000
I would tell them, "Hey guys, this is where I'm going. This is my flight.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000
Northwest flight seven coming into Seattle

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000
on March 12th" or whatever.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000
A couple weeks later, I'd call again, let them know.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.000
It wasn't that I had to, but I chose to.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000
Just wanted to say, "Hey guys.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000
Don't want to make it look like I'm making any sudden moves."

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000
(Laughter)

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.000
"I don't want you guys to think that I'm about to flee.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000
Just letting you know. Heads up."

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000
And so I just kept doing this over and over and over.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000
And then the phone calls turned into emails,

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000
and the emails got longer and longer and longer ...

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000
with pictures,

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000
with travel tips.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000
Then I'd make websites.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000
And then I built this over here. Let me go back to it over here.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.000
So I actually designed this back in 2003.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.000
So this kind of tracks me at any given moment.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000
I wrote some code for my mobile phone.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.000
Basically, what I decided is okay guys, you want to watch me, that's cool.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000
But I'll watch myself. It's okay.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000
You don't have to waste your energy or your resources.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.000
And I'll help you out.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.000
So in the process, I start thinking, well what else might they know about me?

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000
Well they probably have all my flight records,

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:27.000
so I decided to put all my flight records from birth online.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000
So you can see, Delta 1252

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000
going from Kansas City to Atlanta.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.000
And then you see, these are some of the meals that I've been fed on the planes.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000
This was on Delta 719

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:43.000
going from JFK to San Francisco.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.000
See that? They won't let me on a plane with that,

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.000
but they'll give it to me on the plane.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000
(Laughter)

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000
These are the airports that I hang out in,

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.000
because I like airports.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.000
That's Kennedy airport, May 19th, Tuesday.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.000
This is in Warsaw.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000
Singapore. You can see, they're kind of empty.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000
These images are shot really anonymously

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000
to the point where it could be anyone.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.000
But if you can cross-reference this with the other data,

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000
then you're basically replaying the roll of the FBI agent

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000
and putting it all together.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.000
And when you're in a situation

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.000
where you have to justify every moment of your existence,

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.000
you're put in the situation where you react in a very different manner.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.000
At the time that this was going on,

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.000
the last thing on my mind was "art project."

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.000
I was certainly not thinking, hey, I got new work here.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.000
But after going through this, after realizing, well what just happened?

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000
And after piecing together this, this and this,

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.000
this way of actually trying to figure out what happened for myself

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000
eventually evolved into this,

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.000
and it actually became this project.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000
So these are the stores that I shop in -- some of them --

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.000
because they need to know.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.000
This is me buying some duck flavored paste

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.000
at the Ranch 99 in Daly City

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.000
on Sunday, November 15th.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000
At Coreana Supermarket

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000
buying my kimchi because I like kimchi.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.000
And I bought some crabs too right around there,

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.000
and some chitlins at the Safeway in Emoryville.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000
And laundry too. Laundry detergent at West Oakland --

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.000
East Oakland, sorry.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.000
And then my pickled jellyfish

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:11.000
at the Hong Kong Supermarket on Route 18 in East Brunswick.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.000
Now if you go to my bank records,

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000
it'll actually show something from there,

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.000
so you know that, on May 9th,

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.000
that I bought $14.79 in fuel from Safeway Vallejo.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:24.000
So not only that I'm giving this information here and there,

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.000
but now there's a third party,

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.000
an independent third party, my bank,

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000
that's verifying that, yes indeed, I was there at this time.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:34.000
So there's points, and these points are actually being cross-referenced.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000
And there's a verification taking place.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.000
Sometimes they're really small purchases.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.000
So 34 cents foreign transaction fee.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.000
All of these are extracted directly from my bank accounts,

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.000
and everything pops up right away.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.000
Sometimes there's a lot of information.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:51.000
This is exactly where my old apartment in San Francisco was.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.000
And then sometimes you get this.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.000
Sometimes you just get this, just an empty hallway in Salt Lake City,

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.000
January 22nd.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.000
And I can tell you exactly who I was with, where I was,

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.000
because this is what I had to do with the FBI.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.000
I had to tell them every little detail of everything.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.000
I spend a lot of time on the road.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.000
This is a parking lot in Elko, Nevada

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.000
off of Route 80

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.000
at 8:01 p.m. on August 19th.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:14.000
I spend a lot of time in gas stations too -- empty train stations.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.000
So there's multiple databases.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:19.000
And there's thousands and thousands and thousands of images.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:22.000
There's actually 46,000 images right now on my site,

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:25.000
and the FBI has seen all of them --

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:28.000
at least I trust they've seen all of them.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.000
And then sometimes you don't get much information at all,

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.000
you just get this empty bed.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.000
And sometimes you get a lot of text information and no visual information.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.000
So you get something like this.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.000
This, by the way, is the location of my favorite sandwich shop in California --

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000
Vietnamese sandwich.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.000
So there's different categorizations

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000
of meals eaten outside

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:49.000
empty train stations, empty gas stations.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000
These are some of the meals that I've been cooking at home.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.000
So how do you know these are meals eaten at home?

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:56.000
Well the same plate shows up a whole bunch of times.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:59.000
So again, you have to do some detective work here.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:02.000
So sometimes the databases get so specific.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000
These are all tacos eaten in Mexico City

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.000
near a train station

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:09.000
on July fifth to July sixth.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.000
At 11:39 a.m. was this one.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:14.000
At 1:56 p.m. was this one. At 4:59 p.m. was this one.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:17.000
So I time-stamp my life every few moments.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.000
Every few moments I shoot the image.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.000
Now it's all done on my iPhone,

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.000
and it all goes straight up to my server,

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.000
and my server does all the backend work

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:28.000
and categorizes things and puts everything together.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.000
They need to know where I'm doing my business,

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:33.000
because they want to know about my business.

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:36.000
So on December 4th, I went here.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.000
And on Sunday, June 14th at 2009 --

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.000
this was actually about two o'clock in the afternoon

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.000
in Skowhegan, Maine -- this was my apartment there.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:46.000
So what you're basically seeing here

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.000
is all bits and pieces and all this information.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:51.000
If you go to my site, there's tons of things.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:54.000
And really, it's not the most user-friendly interface.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:58.000
It's actually quite user-unfriendly.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.000
And one of the reasons, also being part of the user-unfriendliness,

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.000
is that everything is there,

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.000
but you have to really work through it.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:08.000
So by me putting all this information out there,

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:11.000
what I'm basically telling you is I'm telling you everything.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.000
But in this barrage of noise

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.000
that I'm putting out,

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:19.000
I actually live an incredibly anonymous and private life.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:23.000
And you know very little about me actually.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:26.000
And really so I've come to the conclusion

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.000
that the way you protect your privacy,

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.000
particularly in an era where everything is cataloged

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.000
and everything is archived and everything is recorded,

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:35.000
there's no need to delete information anymore.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:38.000
So what do you do when everything is out there?

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.000
Well you have to take control over it.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:43.000
And if I give you this information directly,

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:46.000
it's a very different type of identity

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:49.000
than if you were to try to go through and try to get bits and pieces.

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:52.000
The other thing that's also interesting that's going on here

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:54.000
is the fact that intelligence agencies --

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:57.000
and it doesn't matter who they are --

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.000
they all operate in an industry

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.000
where their commodity is information,

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:03.000
or restricted access to information.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:06.000
And the reason their information has any value

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:09.000
is, well, because no one else has access to it.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.000
And by me cutting out the middle man

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:14.000
and giving it straight to you,

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:17.000
the information that the FBI has has no value,

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:20.000
so thus devaluing their currency.

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.000
And I understand that, on an individual level,

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.000
it's purely symbolic.

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.000
But if 300 million people in the U.S.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.000
started doing this,

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.000
we would have to redesign the entire intelligence system

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.000
from the ground up.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:35.000
Because it just wouldn't work if everybody was sharing everything.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:37.000
And we're getting to that.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.000
When I first started this project,

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.000
people were looking at me and saying,

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:44.000
"Why would you want to tell everybody what you're doing, where you're at?

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:46.000
Why are you posting these photos?"

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:50.000
This was an age before people were Tweeting everywhere

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:53.000
and 750 million people

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.000
were posting status messages

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:57.000
or poking people.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:00.000
So in a way, I'm glad that I'm completely obsolete.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:03.000
I'm still doing this project, but it is obsolete,

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:05.000
because you're all doing it.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:07.000
This is something that we all are doing on a daily basis,

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:09.000
whether we're aware of it or not.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:12.000
So we're creating our own archives and so on.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:15.000
And you know, some of my friends have always said,

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:17.000
"Hey, you're just paranoid. Why are you doing this?

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:19.000
Because no one's really watching.

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:21.000
No one's really going to bother you."

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:23.000
So one of the things that I do

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:25.000
is I actually look through my server logs very carefully.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.000
Because it's about surveillance.

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:30.000
I'm watching who's watching me.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.000
And I came up with these.

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.000
So these are some of my sample logs.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:37.000
And just little bits and pieces, and you can see some of the things there.

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:40.000
And I cleaned up the list a little bit so you can see.

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:43.000
So you can see that the Homeland Security likes to come by --

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:45.000
Department of Homeland Security.

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:47.000
You can see the National Security Agency likes to come by.

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:51.000
I actually moved very close to them. I live right down the street from them now.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.000
Central Intelligence Agency.

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:57.000
Executive Office of the President.

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:00.000
Not really sure why they show up, but they do.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.000
I think they kind of like to look at art.

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:06.000
And I'm glad that we have patrons of the arts in these fields.

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.000
So thank you very much. I appreciate it.

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:17.000
(Applause)

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:20.000
Bruno Giussani: Hasan, just curious.

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:23.000
You said, "Now everything automatically goes from my iPhone,"

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:25.000
but actually you do take the pictures and put on information.

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:28.000
So how many hours of the day does that take?

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.000
HE: Almost none.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.000
It's no different

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.000
than sending a text.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:37.000
It's no different than checking an email.

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:39.000
It's one of those things, we got by just fine before we had to do any of those.

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:41.000
So it's just become another day.

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:43.000
I mean, when we update a status message,

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:46.000
we don't really think about how long that's going to take.

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.000
So it's really just a matter of my phone clicking a couple of clicks,

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.000
send, and then it's done.

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.000
And everything's automated at the other end.

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:55.000
BG: On the day you are in a place where there is no coverage, the FBI gets crazy?

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.000
HE: Well it goes to the last point that I was at.

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:59.000
So it holds onto the very last point.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:01.000
So if I'm on a 12-hour flight,

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:04.000
you'll see the last airport that I departed from.

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:07.000
BG: Hasan, thank you very much. (HE: Thank you.)

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:09.000
(Applause)
