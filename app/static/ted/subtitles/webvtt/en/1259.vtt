00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Is there anything unique about human beings?

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
There is.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
We're the only creatures

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
with fully developed moral sentiments.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
We're obsessed with morality as social creatures.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
We need to know why people are doing what they're doing.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
And I personally am obsessed with morality.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
It was all due to this woman,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Sister Mary Marastela,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
also known as my mom.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
As an altar boy, I breathed in a lot of incense,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
and I learned to say phrases in Latin,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
but I also had time to think

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
about whether my mother's top-down morality

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
applied to everybody.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
I saw that people who were religious and non-religious

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
were equally obsessed with morality.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
I thought, maybe there's some earthly basis

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
for moral decisions.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
But I wanted to go further

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
than to say our brains make us moral.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
I want to know if there's a chemistry of morality.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
I want to know

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
if there was a moral molecule.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
After 10 years of experiments,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
I found it.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
Would you like to see it? I brought some with me.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
This little syringe

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
contains the moral molecule.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
(Laughter)

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
It's called oxytocin.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
So oxytocin is a simple and ancient molecule

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
found only in mammals.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
In rodents, it was known

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
to make mothers care for their offspring,

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
and in some creatures,

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
allowed for toleration of burrowmates.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
But in humans, it was only known

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
to facilitate birth and breastfeeding in women,

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
and is released by both sexes during sex.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
So I had this idea that oxytocin might be the moral molecule.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
I did what most of us do -- I tried it on some colleagues.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
One of them told me,

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
"Paul, that is the world's stupidist idea.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
It is," he said, "only a female molecule.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
It can't be that important."

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
But I countered, "Well men's brains make this too.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
There must be a reason why."

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
But he was right, it was a stupid idea.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
But it was testably stupid.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
In other words, I thought I could design an experiment

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
to see if oxytocin made people moral.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
Turns out it wasn't so easy.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000
First of all, oxytocin is a shy molecule.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
Baseline levels are near zero,

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
without some stimulus to cause its release.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
And when it's produced, it has a three-minute half-life,

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
and degrades rapidly at room temperature.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
So this experiment would have to cause a surge of oxytocin,

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
have to grab it fast and keep it cold.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
I think I can do that.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
Now luckily, oxytocin is produced

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000
both in the brain and in the blood,

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000
so I could do this experiment without learning neurosurgery.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000
Then I had to measure morality.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000
So taking on Morality with a capital M is a huge project.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000
So I started smaller.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.000
I studied one single virtue:

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
trustworthiness.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
Why? I had shown in the early 2000s

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
that countries with a higher proportion of trustworthy people

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000
are more prosperous.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000
So in these countries, more economic transactions occur

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
and more wealth is created,

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000
alleviating poverty.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000
So poor countries are by and large low trust countries.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000
So if I understood the chemistry of trustworthiness,

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000
I might help alleviate poverty.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000
But I'm also a skeptic.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
I don't want to just ask people, "Are you trustworthy?"

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
So instead I use

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
the Jerry Maguire approach to research.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
If you're so virtuous,

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
show me the money.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000
So what we do in my lab

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000
is we tempt people with virtue and vice by using money.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000
Let me show you how we do that.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000
So we recruit some people for an experiment.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.000
They all get $10 if they agree to show up.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.000
We give them lots of instruction, and we never ever deceive them.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.000
Then we match them in pairs by computer.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000
And in that pair, one person gets a message saying,

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000
"Do you want to give up some of your $10

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000
you earned for being here

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000
and ship it to someone else in the lab?"

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
The trick is you can't see them,

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
you can't talk to them.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000
You only do it one time.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000
Now whatever you give up

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.000
gets tripled in the other person's account.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000
You're going to make them a lot wealthier.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000
And they get a message by computer saying

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000
person one sent you this amount of money.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000
Do you want to keep it all,

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.000
or do you want to send some amount back?

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000
So think about this experiment for minute.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000
You're going to sit on these hard chairs for an hour and a half.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000
Some mad scientist is going to jab your arm with a needle

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
and take four tubes of blood.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000
And now you want me to give up this money and ship it to a stranger?

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.000
So this was the birth of vampire economics.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.000
Make a decision and give me some blood.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000
So in fact, experimental economists

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000
had run this test around the world,

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000
and for much higher stakes,

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000
and the consensus view

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000
was that the measure from the first person to the second was a measure of trust,

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.000
and the transfer from the second person back to the first

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000
measured trustworthiness.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000
But in fact, economists were flummoxed

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.000
on why the second person would ever return any money.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000
They assumed money is good,

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000
why not keep it all?

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000
That's not what we found.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.000
We found 90 percent of the first decision-makers sent money,

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000
and of those who received money,

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000
95 percent returned some of it.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000
But why?

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000
Well by measuring oxytocin

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000
we found that the more money the second person received,

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000
the more their brain produced oxytocin,

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000
and the more oxytocin on board,

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.000
the more money they returned.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.000
So we have a biology of trustworthiness.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000
But wait. What's wrong with this experiment?

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000
Two things.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.000
One is that nothing in the body happens in isolation.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.000
So we measured nine other molecules that interact with oxytocin,

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000
but they didn't have any effect.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000
But the second is

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.000
that I still only had this indirect relationship

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000
between oxytocin and trustworthiness.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.000
I didn't know for sure

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000
oxytocin caused trustworthiness.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000
So to make the experiment,

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.000
I knew I'd have to go into the brain

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000
and manipulate oxytocin directly.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000
I used everything short of a drill

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.000
to get oxytocin into my own brain.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.000
And I found I could do it

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000
with a nasal inhaler.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000
So along with colleagues in Zurich,

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.000
we put 200 men on oxytocin or placebo,

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.000
had that same trust test with money,

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.000
and we found that those on oxytocin not only showed more trust,

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.000
we can more than double the number of people

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.000
who sent all their money to a stranger --

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.000
all without altering mood or cognition.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:27.000
So oxytocin is the trust molecule,

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.000
but is it the moral molecule?

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000
Using the oxytocin inhaler,

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000
we ran more studies.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000
We showed that oxytocin infusion

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.000
increases generosity

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.000
in unilateral monetary transfers

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000
by 80 percent.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000
We showed it increases donations to charity

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.000
by 50 percent.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.000
We've also investigated

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.000
non-pharmacologic ways to raise oxytocin.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.000
These include massage,

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000
dancing and praying.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.000
Yes, my mom was happy about that last one.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.000
And whenever we raise oxytocin,

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000
people willingly open up their wallets

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.000
and share money with strangers.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.000
But why do they do this?

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.000
What does it feel like

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000
when your brain is flooded with oxytocin?

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.000
To investigate this question, we ran an experiment

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.000
where we had people watch a video

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.000
of a father and his four year-old son,

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.000
and his son has terminal brain cancer.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.000
After they watched the video, we had them rate their feelings

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.000
and took blood before and after to measure oxytocin.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.000
The change in oxytocin

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.000
predicted their feelings of empathy.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000
So it's empathy

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.000
that makes us connect to other people.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:37.000
It's empathy that makes us help other people.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:41.000
It's empathy that makes us moral.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.000
Now this idea is not new.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.000
A then unknown philosopher named Adam Smith

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.000
wrote a book in 1759

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.000
called "The Theory of Moral Sentiments."

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:52.000
In this book, Smith argued

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:55.000
that we are moral creatures, not because of a top-down reason,

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.000
but for a bottom-up reason.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.000
He said we're social creatures,

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.000
so we share the emotions of others.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:04.000
So if I do something that hurts you, I feel that pain.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.000
So I tend to avoid that.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:09.000
If I do something that makes you happy, I get to share your joy.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.000
So I tend to do those things.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.000
Now this is the same Adam Smith who, 17 years later,

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:16.000
would write a little book called "The Wealth of Nations" --

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.000
the founding document of economics.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:21.000
But he was, in fact, a moral philosopher,

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.000
and he was right on why we're moral.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:26.000
I just found the molecule behind it.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:29.000
But knowing that molecule is valuable,

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:32.000
because it tells us how to turn up this behavior

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.000
and what turns it off.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.000
In particular, it tells us

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.000
why we see immorality.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.000
So to investigate immorality,

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.000
let me bring you back now to 1980.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.000
I'm working at a gas station

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:48.000
on the outskirts of Santa Barbara, California.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000
You sit in a gas station all day,

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.000
you see lots of morality and immorality, let me tell you.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:55.000
So one Sunday afternoon, a man walks into my cashier's booth

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.000
with this beautiful jewelry box.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.000
Opens it up and there's a pearl necklace inside.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.000
And he said, "Hey, I was in the men's room.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:04.000
I just found this. What do you think we should do with it?"

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.000
"I don't know, put it in the lost and found."

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.000
"Well this is very valuable.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.000
We have to find the owner for this." I said, "Yea."

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.000
So we're trying to decide what to do with this,

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.000
and the phone rings.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.000
And a man says very excitedly,

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.000
"I was in your gas station a while ago,

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.000
and I bought this jewelry for my wife, and I can't find it."

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.000
I said, "Pearl necklace?" "Yeah."

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.000
"Hey, a guy just found it."

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.000
"Oh, you're saving my life. Here's my phone number.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.000
Tell that guy to wait half an hour.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.000
I'll be there and I'll give him a $200 reward."

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.000
Great, so I tell the guy, "Look, relax.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:35.000
Get yourself a fat reward. Life's good."

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.000
He said, "I can't do it.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.000
I have this job interview in Galena in 15 minutes,

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:42.000
and I need this job, I've got to go."

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:44.000
Again he asked me, "What do you think we should do?"

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:47.000
I'm in high school. I have no idea.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.000
So I said, "I'll hold it for you."

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:52.000
He said, "You know, you've been so nice, let's split the reward."

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.000
I'll give you the jewelry, you give me a hundred dollars,

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.000
and when the guy comes ... "

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.000
You see it. I was conned.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:01.000
So this is a classic con called the pigeon drop,

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.000
and I was the pigeon.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.000
So the way many cons work

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:08.000
is not that the conman gets the victim to trust him,

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:11.000
it's that he shows he trusts the victim.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.000
Now we know what happens.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.000
The victim's brain releases oxytocin,

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:18.000
and you're opening up your wallet or purse, giving away the money.

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.000
So who are these people

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:23.000
who manipulate our oxytocin systems?

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:26.000
We found, testing thousands of individuals,

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.000
that five percent of the population

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:31.000
don't release oxytocin on stimulus.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:35.000
So if you trust them, their brains don't release oxytocin.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:38.000
If there's money on the table, they keep it all.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.000
So there's a technical word for these people in my lab.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:43.000
We call them bastards.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.000
(Laughter)

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.000
These are not people you want to have a beer with.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:50.000
They have many of the attributes of psychopaths.

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:53.000
Now there are other ways the system can be inhibited.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:56.000
One is through improper nurturing.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:59.000
So we've studied sexually abused women,

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:02.000
and about half those don't release oxytocin on stimulus.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:04.000
You need enough nurturing

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:06.000
for this system to develop properly.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:09.000
Also, high stress inhibits oxytocin.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.000
So we all know this, when we're really stressed out,

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:14.000
we're not acting our best.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:17.000
There's another way oxytocin is inhibited, which is interesting --

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:20.000
through the action of testosterone.

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:23.000
So we, in experiments, have administered testosterone to men.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.000
And instead of sharing money,

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.000
they become selfish.

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:30.000
But interestingly,

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.000
high testosterone males are also more likely

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:35.000
to use their own money to punish others for being selfish.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:37.000
(Laughter)

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:40.000
Now think about this. It means, within our own biology,

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:43.000
we have the yin and yang of morality.

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.000
We have oxytocin that connects us to others,

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:47.000
makes us feel what they feel.

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.000
And we have testosterone.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.000
And men have 10 times the testosterone as women,

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.000
so men do this more than women --

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:56.000
we have testosterone that makes us want to punish

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.000
people who behave immorally.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.000
We don't need God or government telling us what to do.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:03.000
It's all inside of us.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:05.000
So you may be wondering:

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:07.000
these are beautiful laboratory experiments,

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:09.000
do they really apply to real life?

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:11.000
Yeah, I've been worrying about that too.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.000
So I've gone out of the lab

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:15.000
to see if this really holds in our daily lives.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:18.000
So last summer, I attended a wedding in Southern England.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:21.000
200 people in this beautiful Victorian mansion.

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:23.000
I didn't know a single person.

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:25.000
And I drove up in my rented Vauxhall.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.000
And I took out a centrifuge and dry ice

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:29.000
and needles and tubes.

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:31.000
And I took blood from the bride and the groom

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:33.000
and the wedding party and the family and the friends

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:35.000
before and immediately after the vows.

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:37.000
(Laughter)

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.000
And guess what?

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:41.000
Weddings cause a release of oxytocin,

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:44.000
but they do so in a very particular way.

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:46.000
Who is the center of the wedding solar system?

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.000
The bride.

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.000
She had the biggest increase in oxytocin.

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:53.000
Who loves the wedding almost as much as the bride?

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.000
Her mother, that's right.

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.000
Her mother was number two.

00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:59.000
Then the groom's father, then the groom,

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.000
then the family, then the friends --

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:03.000
arrayed around the bride

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:05.000
like planets around the Sun.

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:08.000
So I think it tells us that we've designed this ritual

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:10.000
to connect us to this new couple,

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.000
connect us emotionally.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:15.000
Why? Because we need them to be successful at reproducing

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:18.000
to perpetuate the species.

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:21.000
I also worried that my trust experiments with small amounts of money

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:25.000
didn't really capture how often we actually trust our lives to strangers.

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:27.000
So even though I have a fear of heights,

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:29.000
I recently strapped myself to another human being

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:32.000
and stepped out of an airplane at 12,000 ft.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.000
I took my blood before and after,

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:37.000
and I had a huge spike of oxytocin.

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:40.000
And there are so many ways we can connect to people.

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:42.000
For example, through social media.

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.000
Many people are Tweeting right now.

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:46.000
So we investigated the role of social media

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.000
and found the using social media

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:51.000
produced a solid double-digit increase in oxytocin.

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:54.000
So I ran this experiment recently for the Korean Broadcasting System.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:58.000
And they had the reporters and their producers participate.

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:00.000
And one of these guys, he must have been 22,

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:03.000
he had 150 percent spike in oxytocin.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:05.000
I mean, astounding; no one has this.

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:07.000
So he was using social media in private.

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:09.000
When I wrote my report to the Koreans,

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:11.000
I said, "Look, I don't know what this guy was doing,"

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:14.000
but my guess was interacting with his mother or his girlfriend.

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.000
They checked.

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.000
He was interacting on his girlfriend's Facebook page.

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:21.000
There you go. That's connection.

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:24.000
So there's tons of ways that we can connect to other people,

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.000
and it seems to be universal.

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.000
Two weeks ago,

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.000
I just got back from Papua New Guinea

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.000
where I went up to the highlands --

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:35.000
very isolated tribes of subsistence farmers

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:38.000
living as they have lived for millenia.

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:41.000
There are 800 different languages in the highlands.

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:44.000
These are the most primitive people in the world.

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:47.000
And they indeed also release oxytocin.

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:51.000
So oxytocin connects us to other people.

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:53.000
Oxytocin makes us feel what other people feel.

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:56.000
And it's so easy to cause people's brains

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:58.000
to release oxytocin.

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:00.000
I know how to do it,

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.000
and my favorite way to do it is, in fact, the easiest.

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:04.000
Let me show it to you.

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:11.000
Come here. Give me a hug.

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:13.000
(Laughter)

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:15.000
There you go.

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:24.000
(Applause)

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:26.000
So my penchant for hugging other people

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:28.000
has earned me the nickname Dr. Love.

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:30.000
I'm happy to share a little more love in the world,

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:32.000
it's great,

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:34.000
but here's your prescription from Dr. Love:

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:37.000
eight hugs a day.

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:39.000
We have found that people who release more oxytocin

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:41.000
are happier.

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:43.000
And they're happier

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:46.000
because they have better relationships of all types.

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:49.000
Dr. Love says eight hugs a day.

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:51.000
Eight hugs a day -- you'll be happier

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:53.000
and the world will be a better place.

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:56.000
Of course, if you don't like to touch people, I can always shove this up your nose.

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:58.000
(Laughter)

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:00.000
Thank you.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:13.000
(Applause)
