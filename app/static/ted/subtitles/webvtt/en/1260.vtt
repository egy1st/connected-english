00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
What is it about flying cars?

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
We've wanted to do this for about a hundred years.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
And there are historic attempts

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
that have had some level of technical success.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
But we haven't yet gotten to the point

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
where on your way here this morning

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
you see something that really, truly seamlessly integrates

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
the two-dimensional world that we're comfortable in

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
with the three-dimensional sky above us --

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
that, I don't know about you, but I really enjoy spending time in.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
We looked at the historical attempts that had been out there

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
and realized that, despite the fact

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
that we have a lot of modern innovations

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
to draw on today

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
that weren't available previously --

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
we have modern composite materials,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
we have aircraft engines that get good fuel economy

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
and have better power-to-rate ratios than have ever been available,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
we have glass cockpit avionics

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
that bring the information you need to fly

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
directly to you in the cockpit --

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
but without fundamentally addressing the problem from a different perspective,

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
we realized that we were going to be getting

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
the same result that people had been getting

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
for the last hundred years,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
which isn't where we want to be right now.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000
So instead of trying to make a car that can fly,

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
we decided to try to make a plane that could drive.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
And the result is the Terrafugia Transition.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
It's a two-seat, single-engine airplane

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
that works just like any other small airplane.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
You take off and land at a local airport.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
Then once you're on the ground,

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
you fold up the wings, drive it home,

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
park it in your garage.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
And it works.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
After two years of an innovative design and construction process,

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
the proof of concept made its public debut

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
in 2008.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
Now like with anything

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
that's really different from the status quo,

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
it didn't always go so well testing that aircraft.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
And we discovered that it's a very good thing

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
that, when you go home with something that's been broken,

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
you've actually learned a lot more

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
than when you managed to tick off all of your test objectives

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
the first time through.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
Still, we very much wanted to see

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
the aircraft that we'd all helped build

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
in the air, off the ground,

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
like it was supposed to be.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
And on our third high-speed testing deployment

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
on a bitter cold morning in upstate New York,

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
we got to do that for the first time.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
The picture behind me was snapped by the copilot in our chase aircraft

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
just moments after the wheels got off the ground for the first time.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
And we were all very flattered to see that image

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
become a symbol of accomplishing something

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
that people had thought was impossible

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
really the world over.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
The flight testing that followed that

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
was as basic and low-risk as we could make it,

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
but it still accomplished what we needed to

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
to take the program to the next step

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
and to gain the credibility that we needed

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000
within our eventual market, the general aviation community,

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
and with the regulators

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
that govern the use of design of aircraft, particularly in the States.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
The FAA, about a year ago,

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
gave us an exemption for the Transition

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000
to allow us to have an additional 110 lbs.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
within the light sport aircraft category.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
Now that doesn't sound like a lot, but it's very important,

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
because being able to deliver the Transition as a light sport aircraft

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
makes it simpler for us to certify it,

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
but it also makes it much easier

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000
for you to learn how to fly it.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000
A sport pilot can be certificated

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000
in as little as 20 hours of flight time.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
And at 110 lbs.,

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000
that's very important for solving the other side of the equation --

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
driving.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
It turns out that driving,

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000
with its associated design implementation and regulatory hurdles,

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000
is actually a harder problem to solve than flying.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
For those of us that spend most of our lives on the ground,

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
this may be counter-intuitive,

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.000
but driving has potholes, cobblestones,

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
pedestrians, other drivers

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000
and a rather long and detailed list

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000
of federal motor vehicle safety standards to contend with.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000
Fortunately, necessity remains the mother of invention,

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000
and a lot of the design work

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000
that we're the most proud of with the aircraft

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000
came out of solving the unique problems

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000
of operating it on the ground --

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000
everything from a continuously-variable transmission

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000
and liquid-based cooling system

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000
that allows us to use an aircraft engine

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000
in stop-and-go traffic,

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000
to a custom-designed gearbox

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
that powers either the propeller when you're flying or the wheels on the ground,

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
to the automated wing-folding mechanism that we'll see in a moment,

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000
to crash safety features.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000
We have a carbon fiber safety cage

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000
that protects the occupants

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.000
for less than 10 percent of the weight of a traditional steel chassis in a car.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000
Now this also, as good as it is, wasn't quite enough.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000
The regulations for vehicles on the road

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000
weren't written with an airplane in mind.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000
So we did need a little bit of support

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000
from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000
Now you may have seen in the news recently,

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
they came through with us at the end of last month

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
with a few special exemptions

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
that will allow the Transition to be sold

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000
in the same category as SUVs and light trucks.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000
As a multi-purpose passenger vehicle,

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.000
it is now officially "designed for occasional off-road use."

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000
(Laughter)

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.000
Now let's see it in action.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.000
You can see there the wings folded up just along the side of the plane.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.000
You're not powering the propeller, you're powering the wheels.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000
And it is under seven feet tall,

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.000
so it will fit in a standard construction garage.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000
And that's the automated wing-folding mechanism.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000
That's real time.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.000
You just push a few buttons in the cockpit, and the wings come out.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000
Once they're fully deployed,

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000
there's a mechanical lock that goes into place,

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000
again, from inside the cockpit.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000
And they're now fully capable of handling

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000
any of the loads you would see in flight --

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.000
just like putting down your convertible top.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.000
And you're all thinking what your neighbors would think of seeing that.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.000
(Video) Test Pilot: Until the vehicle flies,

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.000
75 percent of your risk is that first flight.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000
Radio: It actually flew. Yes.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000
Radio 2: That was gorgeous.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000
Radio: What did you think of that?

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.000
That was beautiful from up here, I tell you.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.000
AMD: See, we're all exceedingly excited about that little bunny hop.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000
And our test pilot gave us

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.000
the best feedback you can get from a test pilot after a first flight,

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000
which was that it was "remarkably unremarkable."

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000
He would go onto tell us

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000
that the Transition had been the easiest airplane to land

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:11.000
that he'd flown in his entire 30-year career as a test pilot.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000
So despite making something

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000
that is seemingly revolutionary,

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000
we really focused on doing

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000
as little new as possible.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.000
We leverage a lot of technology from the state-of-the-art in general aviation

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000
and from automotive racing.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.000
When we do have to do something truly out-of-the-box,

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.000
we use an incremental design, build, test, redesign cycle

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.000
that lets us reduce risk in baby steps.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.000
Now since we started Terrafugia about 6 years ago,

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000
we've had a lot of those baby steps.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000
We've gone from being three of us

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.000
working in the basement at MIT while we were still in graduate school

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000
to about two-dozen of us

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:52.000
working in an initial production facility outside of Boston.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000
We've had to overcome challenges

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000
like keeping the weight below the light sport limit that I talked about,

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.000
figuring out how to politely respond

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000
when a regulator tells you,

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.000
"But that won't fit through a toll booth with the wings extended --

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.000
(Laughter)

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.000
to all of the other associated durability and engineering issues

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.000
that we talked about on the ground.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.000
Still, if everything goes to our satisfaction

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000
with the testing and construction

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.000
of the two production prototypes

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.000
that we're working on right now,

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.000
those first deliveries

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.000
to the, about a hundred, people who have reserved an airplane at this point

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.000
should begin at the end of next year.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:28.000
The Transition will cost in line with other small airplanes.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:31.000
And I'm certainly not out to replace your Chevy,

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:34.000
but I do think that the Transition should be your next airplane.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000
Here's why.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.000
While nearly all of the commercial air travel in the world

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.000
goes through a relatively small number of large hub airports,

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:45.000
there is a huge underutilized resource out there.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.000
There are thousands of local airstrips

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:50.000
that don't see nearly as many aircraft operations a day as they could.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:53.000
On average, there's one within 20 to 30 miles

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.000
of wherever you are in the United States.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.000
The Transition gives you

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:00.000
a safer, more convenient and more fun way

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.000
of using this resource.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.000
For those of you who aren't yet pilots,

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.000
there's four main reasons why those of us who are

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.000
don't fly as much as we'd like to:

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.000
the weather, primarily,

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.000
cost, long door-to-door travel time

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.000
and mobility at your destination.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.000
Now, bad weather comes in,

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:20.000
just land, fold up the wings, drive home.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:23.000
Doesn't matter if it rains a little, you have a windshield wiper.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.000
Instead of paying to keep your airplane in a hanger,

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.000
park it in your garage.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.000
And the unleaded automotive fuel that we use

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000
is both cheaper and better for the environment

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.000
than traditional avgas.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.000
Door-to-door travel time is reduced,

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.000
because now, instead of lugging bags, finding a parking space,

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.000
taking off your shoes or pulling your airplane out of the hanger,

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.000
you're now just spending that time getting to where you want to go.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:48.000
And mobility to your destination is clearly solved.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000
Just fold up the wings and keep going.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:53.000
The Transition simultaneously expands our horizons

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:56.000
while making the world a smaller, more accessible place.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:59.000
It also continues to be a fabulous adventure.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.000
I hope you'll each take a moment

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:04.000
to think about how you could use something like this

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.000
to give yourself more access to your own world,

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:09.000
and to make your own travel more convenient and more fun.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.000
Thank you for giving me the opportunity to share it with you.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:17.000
(Applause)
