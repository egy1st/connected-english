00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
I'm a neuroscientist.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
And in neuroscience,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
we have to deal with many difficult questions about the brain.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
But I want to start with the easiest question

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
and the question you really should have all asked yourselves at some point in your life,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
because it's a fundamental question

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
if we want to understand brain function.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
And that is, why do we and other animals

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
have brains?

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Not all species on our planet have brains,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
so if we want to know what the brain is for,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
let's think about why we evolved one.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Now you may reason that we have one

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
to perceive the world or to think,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
and that's completely wrong.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
If you think about this question for any length of time,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
it's blindingly obvious why we have a brain.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
We have a brain for one reason and one reason only,

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
and that's to produce adaptable and complex movements.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
There is no other reason to have a brain.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
Think about it.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
Movement is the only way you have

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
of affecting the world around you.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
Now that's not quite true. There's one other way, and that's through sweating.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
But apart from that,

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
everything else goes through contractions of muscles.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
So think about communication --

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
speech, gestures, writing, sign language --

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
they're all mediated through contractions of your muscles.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
So it's really important to remember

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.000
that sensory, memory and cognitive processes are all important,

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
but they're only important

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
to either drive or suppress future movements.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
There can be no evolutionary advantage

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
to laying down memories of childhood

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
or perceiving the color of a rose

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
if it doesn't affect the way you're going to move later in life.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
Now for those who don't believe this argument,

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
we have trees and grass on our planet without the brain,

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
but the clinching evidence is this animal here --

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
the humble sea squirt.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
Rudimentary animal, has a nervous system,

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
swims around in the ocean in its juvenile life.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
And at some point of its life,

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
it implants on a rock.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
And the first thing it does in implanting on that rock, which it never leaves,

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
is to digest its own brain and nervous system

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
for food.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
So once you don't need to move,

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
you don't need the luxury of that brain.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
And this animal is often taken

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
as an analogy to what happens at universities

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
when professors get tenure,

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
but that's a different subject.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
(Applause)

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
So I am a movement chauvinist.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
I believe movement is the most important function of the brain --

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
don't let anyone tell you that it's not true.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
Now if movement is so important,

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
how well are we doing

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
understanding how the brain controls movement?

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
And the answer is we're doing extremely poorly; it's a very hard problem.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
But we can look at how well we're doing

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
by thinking about how well we're doing building machines

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
which can do what humans can do.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
Think about the game of chess.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
How well are we doing determining what piece to move where?

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000
If you pit Garry Kasparov here, when he's not in jail,

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
against IBM's Deep Blue,

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000
well the answer is IBM's Deep Blue will occasionally win.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000
And I think if IBM's Deep Blue played anyone in this room, it would win every time.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
That problem is solved.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
What about the problem

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
of picking up a chess piece,

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000
dexterously manipulating it and putting it back down on the board?

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.000
If you put a five year-old child's dexterity against the best robots of today,

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
the answer is simple:

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
the child wins easily.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
There's no competition at all.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000
Now why is that top problem so easy

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000
and the bottom problem so hard?

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000
One reason is a very smart five year-old

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
could tell you the algorithm for that top problem --

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
look at all possible moves to the end of the game

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000
and choose the one that makes you win.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
So it's a very simple algorithm.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
Now of course there are other moves,

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
but with vast computers we approximate

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
and come close to the optimal solution.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000
When it comes to being dexterous,

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000
it's not even clear what the algorithm is you have to solve to be dexterous.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
And we'll see you have to both perceive and act on the world,

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000
which has a lot of problems.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
But let me show you cutting-edge robotics.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000
Now a lot of robotics is very impressive,

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000
but manipulation robotics is really just in the dark ages.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000
So this is the end of a Ph.D. project

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000
from one of the best robotics institutes.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000
And the student has trained this robot

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000
to pour this water into a glass.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000
It's a hard problem because the water sloshes about, but it can do it.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.000
But it doesn't do it with anything like the agility of a human.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.000
Now if you want this robot to do a different task,

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.000
that's another three-year Ph.D. program.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000
There is no generalization at all

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000
from one task to another in robotics.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
Now we can compare this

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000
to cutting-edge human performance.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000
So what I'm going to show you is Emily Fox

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000
winning the world record for cup stacking.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000
Now the Americans in the audience will know all about cup stacking.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000
It's a high school sport

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000
where you have 12 cups you have to stack and unstack

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000
against the clock in a prescribed order.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.000
And this is her getting the world record in real time.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:32.000
(Laughter)

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:37.000
(Applause)

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000
And she's pretty happy.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000
We have no idea what is going on inside her brain when she does that,

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000
and that's what we'd like to know.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000
So in my group, what we try to do

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000
is reverse engineer how humans control movement.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000
And it sounds like an easy problem.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
You send a command down, it causes muscles to contract.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000
Your arm or body moves,

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000
and you get sensory feedback from vision, from skin, from muscles and so on.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000
The trouble is

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000
these signals are not the beautiful signals you want them to be.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000
So one thing that makes controlling movement difficult

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000
is, for example, sensory feedback is extremely noisy.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000
Now by noise, I do not mean sound.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000
We use it in the engineering and neuroscience sense

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000
meaning a random noise corrupting a signal.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.000
So the old days before digital radio when you were tuning in your radio

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000
and you heard "crrcckkk" on the station you wanted to hear,

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000
that was the noise.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.000
But more generally, this noise is something that corrupts the signal.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000
So for example, if you put your hand under a table

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000
and try to localize it with your other hand,

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000
you can be off by several centimeters

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000
due to the noise in sensory feedback.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.000
Similarly, when you put motor output on movement output,

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.000
it's extremely noisy.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000
Forget about trying to hit the bull's eye in darts,

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000
just aim for the same spot over and over again.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.000
You have a huge spread due to movement variability.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.000
And more than that, the outside world, or task,

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000
is both ambiguous and variable.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.000
The teapot could be full, it could be empty.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000
It changes over time.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:54.000
So we work in a whole sensory movement task soup of noise.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000
Now this noise is so great

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000
that society places a huge premium

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.000
on those of us who can reduce the consequences of noise.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.000
So if you're lucky enough to be able to knock a small white ball

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.000
into a hole several hundred yards away using a long metal stick,

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.000
our society will be willing to reward you

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.000
with hundreds of millions of dollars.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000
Now what I want to convince you of

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.000
is the brain also goes through a lot of effort

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.000
to reduce the negative consequences

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000
of this sort of noise and variability.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000
And to do that, I'm going to tell you about a framework

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.000
which is very popular in statistics and machine learning of the last 50 years

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000
called Bayesian decision theory.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.000
And it's more recently a unifying way

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.000
to think about how the brain deals with uncertainty.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.000
And the fundamental idea is you want to make inferences and then take actions.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.000
So let's think about the inference.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.000
You want to generate beliefs about the world.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000
So what are beliefs?

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000
Beliefs could be: where are my arms in space?

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.000
Am I looking at a cat or a fox?

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:49.000
But we're going to represent beliefs with probabilities.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000
So we're going to represent a belief

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000
with a number between zero and one --

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.000
zero meaning I don't believe it at all, one means I'm absolutely certain.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.000
And numbers in between give you the gray levels of uncertainty.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000
And the key idea to Bayesian inference

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.000
is you have two sources of information

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.000
from which to make your inference.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.000
You have data,

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000
and data in neuroscience is sensory input.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.000
So I have sensory input, which I can take in to make beliefs.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.000
But there's another source of information, and that's effectively prior knowledge.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.000
You accumulate knowledge throughout your life in memories.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.000
And the point about Bayesian decision theory

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.000
is it gives you the mathematics

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.000
of the optimal way to combine

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.000
your prior knowledge with your sensory evidence

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.000
to generate new beliefs.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000
And I've put the formula up there.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000
I'm not going to explain what that formula is, but it's very beautiful.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.000
And it has real beauty and real explanatory power.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.000
And what it really says, and what you want to estimate,

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.000
is the probability of different beliefs

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.000
given your sensory input.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.000
So let me give you an intuitive example.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:46.000
Imagine you're learning to play tennis

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.000
and you want to decide where the ball is going to bounce

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.000
as it comes over the net towards you.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000
There are two sources of information

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000
Bayes' rule tells you.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.000
There's sensory evidence -- you can use visual information auditory information,

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:00.000
and that might tell you it's going to land in that red spot.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.000
But you know that your senses are not perfect,

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.000
and therefore there's some variability of where it's going to land

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.000
shown by that cloud of red,

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:10.000
representing numbers between 0.5 and maybe 0.1.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.000
That information is available in the current shot,

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.000
but there's another source of information

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.000
not available on the current shot,

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:20.000
but only available by repeated experience in the game of tennis,

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.000
and that's that the ball doesn't bounce

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.000
with equal probability over the court during the match.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000
If you're playing against a very good opponent,

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000
they may distribute it in that green area,

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.000
which is the prior distribution,

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000
making it hard for you to return.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.000
Now both these sources of information carry important information.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.000
And what Bayes' rule says

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.000
is that I should multiply the numbers on the red by the numbers on the green

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.000
to get the numbers of the yellow, which have the ellipses,

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.000
and that's my belief.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:47.000
So it's the optimal way of combining information.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.000
Now I wouldn't tell you all this if it wasn't that a few years ago,

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000
we showed this is exactly what people do

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.000
when they learn new movement skills.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.000
And what it means

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.000
is we really are Bayesian inference machines.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:01.000
As we go around, we learn about statistics of the world and lay that down,

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.000
but we also learn

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.000
about how noisy our own sensory apparatus is,

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.000
and then combine those

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.000
in a real Bayesian way.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.000
Now a key part to the Bayesian is this part of the formula.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.000
And what this part really says

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.000
is I have to predict the probability

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.000
of different sensory feedbacks

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.000
given my beliefs.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:23.000
So that really means I have to make predictions of the future.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.000
And I want to convince you the brain does make predictions

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.000
of the sensory feedback it's going to get.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.000
And moreover, it profoundly changes your perceptions

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.000
by what you do.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.000
And to do that, I'll tell you

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.000
about how the brain deals with sensory input.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:38.000
So you send a command out,

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.000
you get sensory feedback back,

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.000
and that transformation is governed

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.000
by the physics of your body and your sensory apparatus.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.000
But you can imagine looking inside the brain.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.000
And here's inside the brain.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.000
You might have a little predictor, a neural simulator,

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.000
of the physics of your body and your senses.

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.000
So as you send a movement command down,

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.000
you tap a copy of that off

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.000
and run it into your neural simulator

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:03.000
to anticipate the sensory consequences of your actions.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.000
So as I shake this ketchup bottle,

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:08.000
I get some true sensory feedback as the function of time in the bottom row.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:11.000
And if I've got a good predictor, it predicts the same thing.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.000
Well why would I bother doing that?

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.000
I'm going to get the same feedback anyway.

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:17.000
Well there's good reasons.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.000
Imagine, as I shake the ketchup bottle,

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:22.000
someone very kindly comes up to me and taps it on the back for me.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.000
Now I get an extra source of sensory information

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.000
due to that external act.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.000
So I get two sources.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:31.000
I get you tapping on it, and I get me shaking it,

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:33.000
but from my senses' point of view,

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:36.000
that is combined together into one source of information.

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.000
Now there's good reason to believe

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:41.000
that you would want to be able to distinguish external events from internal events.

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:44.000
Because external events are actually much more behaviorally relevant

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:47.000
than feeling everything that's going on inside my body.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.000
So one way to reconstruct that

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.000
is to compare the prediction --

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:53.000
which is only based on your movement commands --

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.000
with the reality.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:58.000
Any discrepancy should hopefully be external.

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.000
So as I go around the world,

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:03.000
I'm making predictions of what I should get, subtracting them off.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:05.000
Everything left over is external to me.

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:07.000
What evidence is there for this?

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.000
Well there's one very clear example

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.000
where a sensation generated by myself feels very different

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.000
then if generated by another person.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.000
And so we decided the most obvious place to start

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.000
was with tickling.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.000
It's been known for a long time, you can't tickle yourself

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.000
as well as other people can.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:24.000
But it hasn't really been shown, it's because you have a neural simulator,

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.000
simulating your own body

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.000
and subtracting off that sense.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:31.000
So we can bring the experiments of the 21st century

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:34.000
by applying robotic technologies to this problem.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:37.000
And in effect, what we have is some sort of stick in one hand attached to a robot,

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.000
and they're going to move that back and forward.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.000
And then we're going to track that with a computer

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:43.000
and use it to control another robot,

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.000
which is going to tickle their palm with another stick.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:47.000
And then we're going to ask them to rate a bunch of things

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.000
including ticklishness.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.000
I'll show you just one part of our study.

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.000
And here I've taken away the robots,

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:56.000
but basically people move with their right arm sinusoidally back and forward.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:59.000
And we replay that to the other hand with a time delay.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.000
Either no time delay,

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.000
in which case light would just tickle your palm,

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:07.000
or with a time delay of two-tenths of three-tenths of a second.

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:09.000
So the important point here

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:12.000
is the right hand always does the same things -- sinusoidal movement.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:15.000
The left hand always is the same and puts sinusoidal tickle.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:17.000
All we're playing with is a tempo causality.

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:19.000
And as we go from naught to 0.1 second,

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:21.000
it becomes more ticklish.

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:23.000
As you go from 0.1 to 0.2,

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:25.000
it becomes more ticklish at the end.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.000
And by 0.2 of a second,

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:29.000
it's equivalently ticklish

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:31.000
to the robot that just tickled you without you doing anything.

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:33.000
So whatever is responsible for this cancellation

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:36.000
is extremely tightly coupled with tempo causality.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:39.000
And based on this illustration, we really convinced ourselves in the field

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:41.000
that the brain's making precise predictions

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:44.000
and subtracting them off from the sensations.

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:47.000
Now I have to admit, these are the worst studies my lab has ever run.

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:49.000
Because the tickle sensation on the palm comes and goes,

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:51.000
you need large numbers of subjects

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.000
with these stars making them significant.

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.000
So we were looking for a much more objective way

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.000
to assess this phenomena.

00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:59.000
And in the intervening years I had two daughters.

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:02.000
And one thing you notice about children in backseats of cars on long journeys,

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:04.000
they get into fights --

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:07.000
which started with one of them doing something to the other, the other retaliating.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:09.000
It quickly escalates.

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:12.000
And children tend to get into fights which escalate in terms of force.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.000
Now when I screamed at my children to stop,

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.000
sometimes they would both say to me

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:19.000
the other person hit them harder.

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:21.000
Now I happen to know my children don't lie,

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.000
so I thought, as a neuroscientist,

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:25.000
it was important how I could explain

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:27.000
how they were telling inconsistent truths.

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:29.000
And we hypothesize based on the tickling study

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:31.000
that when one child hits another,

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.000
they generate the movement command.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:36.000
They predict the sensory consequences and subtract it off.

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.000
So they actually think they've hit the person less hard than they have --

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.000
rather like the tickling.

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:42.000
Whereas the passive recipient

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.000
doesn't make the prediction, feels the full blow.

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:46.000
So if they retaliate with the same force,

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.000
the first person will think it's been escalated.

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.000
So we decided to test this in the lab.

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:53.000
(Laughter)

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.000
Now we don't work with children, we don't work with hitting,

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.000
but the concept is identical.

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:00.000
We bring in two adults. We tell them they're going to play a game.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.000
And so here's player one and player two sitting opposite to each other.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.000
And the game is very simple.

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:06.000
We started with a motor

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:08.000
with a little lever, a little force transfuser.

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:10.000
And we use this motor to apply force down to player one's fingers

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:13.000
for three seconds and then it stops.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:16.000
And that player's been told, remember the experience of that force

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.000
and use your other finger

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:20.000
to apply the same force

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:23.000
down to the other subject's finger through a force transfuser -- and they do that.

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:26.000
And player two's been told, remember the experience of that force.

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:29.000
Use your other hand to apply the force back down.

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:31.000
And so they take it in turns

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:33.000
to apply the force they've just experienced back and forward.

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:35.000
But critically,

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:38.000
they're briefed about the rules of the game in separate rooms.

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:40.000
So they don't know the rules the other person's playing by.

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.000
And what we've measured

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:44.000
is the force as a function of terms.

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.000
And if we look at what we start with,

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.000
a quarter of a Newton there, a number of turns,

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:50.000
perfect would be that red line.

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:53.000
And what we see in all pairs of subjects is this --

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:55.000
a 70 percent escalation in force

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:57.000
on each go.

00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:59.000
So it really suggests, when you're doing this --

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:01.000
based on this study and others we've done --

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.000
that the brain is canceling the sensory consequences

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:05.000
and underestimating the force it's producing.

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:07.000
So it re-shows the brain makes predictions

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:10.000
and fundamentally changes the precepts.

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:13.000
So we've made inferences, we've done predictions,

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:15.000
now we have to generate actions.

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:17.000
And what Bayes' rule says is, given my beliefs,

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:19.000
the action should in some sense be optimal.

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:21.000
But we've got a problem.

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:24.000
Tasks are symbolic -- I want to drink, I want to dance --

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:26.000
but the movement system has to contract 600 muscles

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:28.000
in a particular sequence.

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:30.000
And there's a big gap

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:32.000
between the task and the movement system.

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:34.000
So it could be bridged in infinitely many different ways.

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:36.000
So think about just a point to point movement.

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:38.000
I could choose these two paths

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:40.000
out of an infinite number of paths.

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:42.000
Having chosen a particular path,

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:44.000
I can hold my hand on that path

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:46.000
as infinitely many different joint configurations.

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:48.000
And I can hold my arm in a particular joint configuration

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:50.000
either very stiff or very relaxed.

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:53.000
So I have a huge amount of choice to make.

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:56.000
Now it turns out, we are extremely stereotypical.

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:59.000
We all move the same way pretty much.

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:01.000
And so it turns out we're so stereotypical,

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:03.000
our brains have got dedicated neural circuitry

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:05.000
to decode this stereotyping.

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:07.000
So if I take some dots

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:10.000
and set them in motion with biological motion,

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:13.000
your brain's circuitry would understand instantly what's going on.

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:15.000
Now this is a bunch of dots moving.

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:18.000
You will know what this person is doing,

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:21.000
whether happy, sad, old, young -- a huge amount of information.

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:23.000
If these dots were cars going on a racing circuit,

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:26.000
you would have absolutely no idea what's going on.

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:28.000
So why is it

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:30.000
that we move the particular ways we do?

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:32.000
Well let's think about what really happens.

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:35.000
Maybe we don't all quite move the same way.

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:37.000
Maybe there's variation in the population.

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:39.000
And maybe those who move better than others

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:41.000
have got more chance of getting their children into the next generation.

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:44.000
So in evolutionary scales, movements get better.

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:47.000
And perhaps in life, movements get better through learning.

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:49.000
So what is it about a movement which is good or bad?

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:51.000
Imagine I want to intercept this ball.

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:54.000
Here are two possible paths to that ball.

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:56.000
Well if I choose the left-hand path,

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:58.000
I can work out the forces required

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:00.000
in one of my muscles as a function of time.

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:02.000
But there's noise added to this.

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:05.000
So what I actually get, based on this lovely, smooth, desired force,

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:07.000
is a very noisy version.

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:10.000
So if I pick the same command through many times,

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:13.000
I will get a different noisy version each time, because noise changes each time.

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:15.000
So what I can show you here

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:17.000
is how the variability of the movement will evolve

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:19.000
if I choose that way.

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:22.000
If I choose a different way of moving -- on the right for example --

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:24.000
then I'll have a different command, different noise,

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:27.000
playing through a noisy system, very complicated.

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:30.000
All we can be sure of is the variability will be different.

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:32.000
If I move in this particular way,

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:35.000
I end up with a smaller variability across many movements.

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:37.000
So if I have to choose between those two,

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:39.000
I would choose the right one because it's less variable.

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:41.000
And the fundamental idea

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:43.000
is you want to plan your movements

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:46.000
so as to minimize the negative consequence of the noise.

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:48.000
And one intuition to get

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:50.000
is actually the amount of noise or variability I show here

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:52.000
gets bigger as the force gets bigger.

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:55.000
So you want to avoid big forces as one principle.

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:57.000
So we've shown that using this,

00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:59.000
we can explain a huge amount of data --

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:02.000
that exactly people are going about their lives planning movements

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:05.000
so as to minimize negative consequences of noise.

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:07.000
So I hope I've convinced you the brain is there

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:09.000
and evolved to control movement.

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:12.000
And it's an intellectual challenge to understand how we do that.

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:14.000
But it's also relevant

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:16.000
for disease and rehabilitation.

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:19.000
There are many diseases which effect movement.

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:21.000
And hopefully if we understand how we control movement,

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:23.000
we can apply that to robotic technology.

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:25.000
And finally, I want to remind you,

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:27.000
when you see animals do what look like very simple tasks,

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:29.000
the actual complexity of what is going on inside their brain

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:31.000
is really quite dramatic.

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:33.000
Thank you very much.

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:41.000
(Applause)

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:43.000
Chris Anderson: Quick question for you, Dan.

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:47.000
So you're a movement -- (DW: Chauvinist.) -- chauvinist.

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:50.000
Does that mean that you think that the other things we think our brains are about --

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:53.000
the dreaming, the yearning, the falling in love and all these things --

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:56.000
are a kind of side show, an accident?

00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:58.000
DW: No, no, actually I think they're all important

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:01.000
to drive the right movement behavior to get reproduction in the end.

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:04.000
So I think people who study sensation or memory

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:06.000
without realizing why you're laying down memories of childhood.

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:09.000
The fact that we forget most of our childhood, for example,

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:12.000
is probably fine, because it doesn't effect our movements later in life.

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:15.000
You only need to store things which are really going to effect movement.

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:18.000
CA: So you think that people thinking about the brain, and consciousness generally,

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:20.000
could get real insight

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:22.000
by saying, where does movement play in this game?

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:24.000
DW: So people have found out for example

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:26.000
that studying vision in the absence of realizing why you have vision

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:28.000
is a mistake.

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:30.000
You have to study vision with the realization

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:32.000
of how the movement system is going to use vision.

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:34.000
And it uses it very differently once you think about it that way.

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:37.000
CA: Well that was quite fascinating. Thank you very much indeed.

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:39.000
(Applause)
