00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
So magic is a very introverted field.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
While scientists regularly publish their latest research,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
we magicians do not like to share our methods and secrets.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
That's true even amongst peers.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
But if you look at creative practice as a form of research,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
or art as a form of R&amp;D for humanity,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
then how could a cyber illusionist like myself

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
share his research?

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Now my own speciality is combining digital technology and magic.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
And about three years ago,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
I started an exercise

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
in openness and inclusiveness

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
by reaching out into the open-source software community

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
to create new digital tools for magic --

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
tools that could eventually be shared with other artists

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
to start them off further on in the process

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000
and to get them to the poetry faster.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Today, I'd like to show you something which came out of these collaborations.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
It's an augmented reality

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
projection tracking and mapping system,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
or a digital storytelling tool.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
Could we bring down the lights please? Thank you.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
So let's give this a try.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
And I'm going to use it

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
to give you my take

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
on the stuff of life.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
(Applause)

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:33.000
(Music)

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
Terribly sorry. I forgot the floor.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
Wake up.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
Hey.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
Come on.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:02:07.000
(Music)

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
Please.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:27.000
(Music)

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
Come on.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
Ah, sorry about that.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
Forgot this.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:44.000
(Music)

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
Give it another try.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
Okay.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
He figured out the system.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:03.000
(Music)

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000
(Laughter)

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
(Applause)

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:17.000
(Music)

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
Uh oh.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:29.000
(Music)

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.000
All right. Let's try this.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000
Come on.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:57.000
(Music)

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
(Laughter)

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:25.000
(Music)

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000
Hey.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:05:01.000
(Music)

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000
You heard her, go ahead.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000
(Laughter)

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000
(Applause)

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000
Bye-bye.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:23.000
(Applause)
