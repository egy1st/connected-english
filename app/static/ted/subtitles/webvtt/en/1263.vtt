00:00:00.057 --> 00:00:03.673
The story I want to tell you about, started to me,

00:00:03.673 --> 00:00:07.825
in 1996 when I was studying in England.

00:00:07.825 --> 00:00:11.989
One day, I was glancing through my bank statement
(I didn't have much to look at)

00:00:11.989 --> 00:00:17.231
and I've noticed that in the upper corner there was
a symbol, that I'm going to show you,

00:00:17.331 --> 00:00:21.790
saying that document had been made in
plain language, for me to understand it.

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:24.130
The idea interested me; I tried to find out
what that was

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:28.298
and I found out that there was a campaign for the
simplification of language,

00:00:28.298 --> 00:00:30.039
which was the "Plain English Campaign".

00:00:30.085 --> 00:00:33.010
I thought it was a fabulous idea, for about 
one day or two,

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:34.749
and I've never thought about it since.

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:37.285
When I came back to Portugal, for good,

00:00:37.285 --> 00:00:42.430
I came across with several documents - for example, 
my work contract,

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:47.127
the papers I had to sign to buy a house, 
the electricity bill --

00:00:47.127 --> 00:00:50.528
a series of documents that reminded me of 
that bank statement.

00:00:50.528 --> 00:00:54.105
Not because they were equally clear and simple,

00:00:54.105 --> 00:00:56.711
but because they were the exact opposite.

00:00:56.711 --> 00:01:01.505
Because I had to read everything twice or thrice, 
to begin to understand what was written there.

00:01:01.505 --> 00:01:08.361
And then, that little seed that had been sown
in 1996, started germinating.

00:01:08.423 --> 00:01:10.174
And one day, I found myself

00:01:10.174 --> 00:01:14.174
entering through my boss' office and quitting 
my job to dedicate myself to this.

00:01:14.174 --> 00:01:17.634
And so, what did I find out, right off the start?

00:01:17.634 --> 00:01:20.558
I found out that it was a much more severe problem 
than I thought.

00:01:20.558 --> 00:01:25.024
It wasn't only about these documents being 
complex and annoying,

00:01:25.024 --> 00:01:28.324
it was the fact that Portuguese people's literacy --

00:01:28.324 --> 00:01:31.159
literacy is the hability to understand written documents --

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:36.692
is extremely low. I'm going to show you a chart about Portuguese people's literacy [rate].

00:01:36.692 --> 00:01:40.273
You know that about 10, 11% of people, in Portugal,

00:01:40.273 --> 00:01:43.082
don't know how to read nor write at all, yet.

00:01:43.082 --> 00:01:47.297
Over there are those who know, or say they know, 
how to read and write. So, what do we have?

00:01:47.297 --> 00:01:52.657
We have that group of red people in level 1, 
which is the lowest in literacy [rate].

00:01:52.657 --> 00:01:55.981
They are persons who are able to join letters,

00:01:55.981 --> 00:01:58.529
but they can't, actually, understand.

00:01:58.529 --> 00:02:02.216
For example, if a person, from that red group, 
has to pick up

00:02:02.216 --> 00:02:07.496
the package leaflet of a medicinal product, 
to give a dose of medicine to his/her child,

00:02:07.496 --> 00:02:09.965
he/she can't, can't understand the information.

00:02:09.965 --> 00:02:15.093
50% of the Portuguese. Then we have 30% more, 
those yellow ones,

00:02:15.093 --> 00:02:19.644
over there, people who get by
on the daily basis.

00:02:19.644 --> 00:02:23.018
That is, if they don't have to read anything too new 
or too different, they will manage.

00:02:23.018 --> 00:02:26.718
But, for example, if they work in a factory and 
a new machine arrives

00:02:26.718 --> 00:02:31.616
and they have to read the machine's manual 
to be able to work with it, they can't do it anymore.

00:02:31.616 --> 00:02:36.068
And there they go, 80% of the Portuguese people.

00:02:36.068 --> 00:02:38.684
Then we have a few more that can handle documents,

00:02:38.684 --> 00:02:40.111
as long as they are not too complex,

00:02:40.111 --> 00:02:45.550
and we have 5% of the population that 
can handle really complex documents.

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:50.587
Now, just so you don't think this is normal, 
that over there is Sweden.

00:02:50.587 --> 00:02:55.936
While we have 20% of people with the literacy 
considered essential for a daily basis,

00:02:55.936 --> 00:02:59.453
Sweden has 75%.

00:02:59.453 --> 00:03:01.561
And looking at that, what did I realize?

00:03:01.561 --> 00:03:04.896
I realized we live in an apartheid of information.

00:03:04.896 --> 00:03:10.647
I realized that there's a small minority of people 
who has indeed access to information

00:03:10.647 --> 00:03:16.041
and can use it to their advantage and 
a huge majority that can't.

00:03:16.041 --> 00:03:19.847
And because they can't, they are excluded 
and they are impaired.

00:03:19.847 --> 00:03:21.863
Let me give you an example.

00:03:21.863 --> 00:03:27.230
That one is Mr. Domingos, my building's doorkeeper. Mr. Domingos started to read at the age of 27,

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:30.278
so, he falls in that yellow group that 
we have seen a little while ago.

00:03:30.278 --> 00:03:32.231
From time to time, I'm arriving home and he says:

00:03:32.231 --> 00:03:34.362
"Miss Sandra!"; "Yes, Mr. Domingos."

00:03:34.362 --> 00:03:38.881
"Here is a little letter." So, the deal is: when Mr. Domingos or someone in the family or in the neighbourhood

00:03:38.881 --> 00:03:42.576
receives something that they don't understand, 
they come to me and I help them to translate it.

00:03:42.576 --> 00:03:44.186
And so, that time he said to me like this:

00:03:44.186 --> 00:03:47.911
"Oh, Miss Sandra, I'm about to throw this away, 
but check it if this is important."

00:03:47.911 --> 00:03:52.737
It was very important. He had been waiting, 
for quite a while, to have a knee surgery

00:03:52.737 --> 00:03:56.597
and that was the letter of the famous surgery-bank
checks. When a person is waiting for a long time,

00:03:56.597 --> 00:04:00.288
they get a bank check and with that bank check 
they can have that surgery in the private sector.

00:04:00.288 --> 00:04:03.324
It was almost thrown away into the garbage, 
Mr. Domingos' letter.

00:04:03.324 --> 00:04:05.475
In that same year, I've found out,

00:04:05.475 --> 00:04:09.069
only 20% of people had used these 
surgery-bank checks.

00:04:09.069 --> 00:04:15.156
The other 80%, I don't believe they had been cured
while they were waiting.

00:04:15.156 --> 00:04:18.192
They most likely did the same as Mr. Domingos:

00:04:18.192 --> 00:04:20.487
"Ah! What's this? I'm not understanding, 
it's going to the garbage".

00:04:20.487 --> 00:04:23.436
They lost the opportunity to have the surgery 
they needed.

00:04:23.436 --> 00:04:27.739
What happens here? When people don't understand

00:04:27.739 --> 00:04:31.307
this has severe consequences -- to the individual, 
but also for the country.

00:04:31.307 --> 00:04:34.519
When I don't understand which are my rights, 
the benefits I can have access to,

00:04:34.519 --> 00:04:39.368
I can't understand my duties and I'm not 
an active and participative citizen either.

00:04:39.368 --> 00:04:43.428
Now, maybe, you are sitting there and thinking:

00:04:43.428 --> 00:04:47.415
"Yeah, poor Mr. Domingos... Bad luck, isn't it? 
Me?! I'm in the green ones."

00:04:47.415 --> 00:04:51.468
"I'm absolutely sure that I'm one of the green ones. 
I was selected to come to TED! Hum?" (Laughter)

00:04:51.468 --> 00:04:55.796
So the deal is: I have here some texts to read to you

00:04:55.796 --> 00:04:59.640
and I'm going to see what color are you 
when I finish reading.

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:03.339
So, come on, this is an automobile insurance 
contract. It says this:

00:05:03.339 --> 00:05:09.825
"Unless contrary stipulation, the decease of the ensured person, the ensured capital is provided,

00:05:09.825 --> 00:05:15.660
in case of predeceasing of the beneficiary relatively to the ensured person, to the heirs of the last,

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:19.089
in case of the simultaneous decease of the ensured person and of the beneficiary,

00:05:19.089 --> 00:05:21.491
to the heirs of the last". Hum? (Laughter)

00:05:21.491 --> 00:05:26.535
Next, there's another one, from the medicines' 
package leaflet, that says the following:

00:05:26.535 --> 00:05:33.938
"Warning! It may also occur erythema, edema, 
vesiculation, keratolysis and urticaria."

00:05:33.999 --> 00:05:36.821
Hum? Are you clear?

00:05:37.005 --> 00:05:40.396
And this one is really good. This one, I signed
a renting contract to the new office on Friday

00:05:40.396 --> 00:05:41.724
and I laughed my head off.

00:05:41.724 --> 00:05:47.284
So, it said: "I, as a cosigner, assume the opportune 
payment of the rents,

00:05:47.284 --> 00:05:51.100
waiving the benefits of the division 
and prior foreclosure."

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:54.612
When I heard "opportune payment" ["storm payment" 
in Portuguese], I imagined myself bursting in there,

00:05:54.612 --> 00:05:58.498
slamming the door and saying: "Here's the money!!!"
(Laughter)

00:05:58.498 --> 00:05:59.847
But it's not! (Laughter) (Applause)

00:05:59.847 --> 00:06:00.796
But it's not! (Applause)

00:06:00.796 --> 00:06:02.001
(Applause)

00:06:02.001 --> 00:06:04.922
(Applause)

00:06:04.999 --> 00:06:08.983
So, it's this: when we leave our area of expertise --

00:06:08.983 --> 00:06:12.612
and it only takes a little; there is no need to go 
to the string theory or something like that,

00:06:12.612 --> 00:06:14.202
it only takes a little... (Laughter)

00:06:14.202 --> 00:06:15.943
What happens?

00:06:15.943 --> 00:06:19.639
We get as lost as Mr. Domingos.

00:06:19.639 --> 00:06:23.612
And these documents are not written 
by experts to experts,

00:06:23.612 --> 00:06:25.461
as the ones from the string theory.

00:06:25.461 --> 00:06:28.909
No! These are documents written for me, 
these are the public documents,

00:06:28.909 --> 00:06:32.613
the public documents I need to understand 
in my daily life,

00:06:32.613 --> 00:06:34.203
to govern myself, to live my life.

00:06:34.203 --> 00:06:36.938
These are the renting contracts, the package leaflet 
of the medicines.

00:06:36.938 --> 00:06:39.927
It's all this. The electricity bills.

00:06:40.096 --> 00:06:41.969
This has to be clear, so that I can understand.

00:06:41.969 --> 00:06:44.329
Because, if I can't understand, what happens?

00:06:44.329 --> 00:06:47.658
I make mistakes, I get wrong.

00:06:47.658 --> 00:06:51.691
I'm going to give you an example of mistakes that 
were committed, bad decisions made

00:06:51.691 --> 00:06:53.935
for not being able to understand documents.

00:06:53.935 --> 00:06:57.674
Do you remember the subprime crisis that 
took place in the United States?

00:06:57.674 --> 00:06:59.871
What happened?

00:06:59.871 --> 00:07:02.848
People signed those loans to buy houses,

00:07:02.848 --> 00:07:05.071
without truly understanding what they were signing.

00:07:05.071 --> 00:07:07.335
Because if they knew what they were signing,

00:07:07.335 --> 00:07:13.485
they'd know that as soon as the interest rate started
to rise, the monthly payment would also increase,

00:07:13.485 --> 00:07:16.669
they wouldn't be able to pay anymore and 
they would end up without a house.

00:07:16.669 --> 00:07:20.726
So, the rest, after that, next, everything 
crumbled down and we know the rest.

00:07:20.726 --> 00:07:25.989
Do you think that if there was a culture of clarity 
in the financial sector

00:07:25.989 --> 00:07:28.016
things would have got up to where they've got?

00:07:28.016 --> 00:07:31.521
I don't think so. So,

00:07:31.521 --> 00:07:34.847
how do you solve this problem,

00:07:34.909 --> 00:07:38.066
this such big difference between the 
literacy [rate] of the Portuguese,

00:07:38.097 --> 00:07:41.116
that is down here, and the complexity 
of the public documents,

00:07:41.116 --> 00:07:44.583
those ones we need to understand
in our daily lives, sorry,

00:07:44.583 --> 00:07:46.157
that are up here?

00:07:46.157 --> 00:07:48.728
So, the first think that comes to mind is,

00:07:48.728 --> 00:07:52.004
"If literacy is down here, let's make it rise" -- isn't it?

00:07:52.004 --> 00:07:53.926
Let's educate people.

00:07:53.942 --> 00:07:57.077
Let's, let's... of course we will, 
of course we will educate people.

00:07:57.077 --> 00:08:01.196
The thing is, it's hard and it's slow. 
And I don't even want to imagine

00:08:01.196 --> 00:08:05.351
how many generations it will take until we are 
at Sweden's level.

00:08:05.351 --> 00:08:07.848
But, besides that, it's not only because it is slow. 
There is another problem.

00:08:07.848 --> 00:08:11.681
If the language of the documents 
isn't simpler,

00:08:11.681 --> 00:08:16.680
we've already seen that people, even with 
a high literacy level, like you,

00:08:16.680 --> 00:08:19.844
if the language is hard, they don't get cleared,

00:08:19.844 --> 00:08:22.742
they continue to be unable to understand
these documents.

00:08:22.742 --> 00:08:26.746
So, besides increasing literacy [rate], and for now,

00:08:26.746 --> 00:08:30.840
it's much more important to reduce 
the complexity of documents

00:08:30.901 --> 00:08:33.719
and simplify the language.

00:08:35.304 --> 00:08:37.305
I'm going to show you an example.

00:08:37.305 --> 00:08:39.306
When I talk about simplifying the language. 
Notice!

00:08:39.306 --> 00:08:43.381
On the left side of a contract:

00:08:43.381 --> 00:08:46.815
"It is agreed that the insurance company, bla bla bla, 
bla bla bla, bla bla..."

00:08:46.815 --> 00:08:51.314
This is a before and after example. What do we mean with simplifying language?

00:08:51.314 --> 00:08:59.119
It's communicating in a simple and clear way, 
enabling our reader to understand it at first glance.

00:08:59.119 --> 00:09:03.043
What do you prefer? Before or after?

00:09:03.043 --> 00:09:05.311
There isn't much doubt, is there?

00:09:05.311 --> 00:09:11.449
So, how is this achieved? How can you make 
the State and companies communicate

00:09:11.449 --> 00:09:14.658
with citizens in a language they can understand 
at first glance?

00:09:14.658 --> 00:09:18.079
There are several ways. There are countries 
that are going by the path of legislation.

00:09:18.079 --> 00:09:24.144
For example, Sweden and the United States 
introduced, last year, a legislation that forces

00:09:24.144 --> 00:09:27.649
the State to communicate with people in 
a language they can understand.

00:09:27.649 --> 00:09:30.654
And you think, "Well, that's normal. 
They are countries that are a bit ahead.

00:09:30.654 --> 00:09:33.115
"Sweden, maybe, much more than the United States.

00:09:33.115 --> 00:09:34.765
"But they are countries that are a bit ahead.

00:09:34.765 --> 00:09:38.314
"It would be nice if in our country there was also 
legislation towards that, wouldn't it be?"

00:09:38.314 --> 00:09:42.862
So it would. And there is! Since 1999.

00:09:42.862 --> 00:09:45.584
The Law of the Administrative Modernization 
says that

00:09:45.584 --> 00:09:48.260
the communication between the State and the people

00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:53.613
should be simple, clear, concise, meaningful, 
without acronyms, bla bla bla...

00:09:53.613 --> 00:09:55.660
But the thing is: it is not applied. So, the question,

00:09:55.660 --> 00:09:58.928
the path of going through legislation, 
enforcing through legislation,

00:09:58.928 --> 00:10:02.922
works in those countries where laws 
are made to be applied.

00:10:02.922 --> 00:10:07.493
Now, there is another way, the way of marketing.

00:10:07.493 --> 00:10:10.200
How does that work? It's like this:

00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:14.847
private companies change their language; 
communicate in a clearer and simpler way,

00:10:14.847 --> 00:10:17.109
they make a big fuss about it, consumers love it,

00:10:17.109 --> 00:10:19.983
the sales rise, it works beautifully.

00:10:19.983 --> 00:10:21.973
But it works for the private sector.

00:10:21.973 --> 00:10:27.020
Now, what is the third path, and to me, 
the most important one?

00:10:27.020 --> 00:10:29.285
It's the path of civil movements,

00:10:29.316 --> 00:10:31.941
that are based in a mentality shift.

00:10:31.987 --> 00:10:34.628
In countries where this really went forward --

00:10:34.628 --> 00:10:36.787
do you remember the English label, of the
"Plain English Campaign"? --

00:10:36.787 --> 00:10:39.976
this is all based on a consumers' movement.

00:10:39.976 --> 00:10:44.503
So, what does it take for that civic movement 
to happen?

00:10:44.503 --> 00:10:47.350
We need to understand two very important things:

00:10:47.350 --> 00:10:52.381
First, wanting to understand these 
public documents is not a whim,

00:10:52.381 --> 00:10:54.729
is not an intellectual curiosity.

00:10:54.729 --> 00:10:56.897
It is a necessity that I have in my daily life.

00:10:56.897 --> 00:11:00.045
And above all, it is a right, it is everyone's right.

00:11:00.045 --> 00:11:03.790
On this side we have: understanding is a right.

00:11:03.790 --> 00:11:05.394
And we have to understand another thing too,

00:11:05.410 --> 00:11:08.983
which is: he who writes, has to write in order 
to be understood.

00:11:08.983 --> 00:11:11.034
How do we get there?

00:11:11.034 --> 00:11:15.960
First of all: we have to become demanding 
consumers and citizens.

00:11:15.960 --> 00:11:20.435
Think it this way: next time someone 
gives you a document

00:11:20.435 --> 00:11:23.428
that you just simply don't understand, don't be shy,

00:11:23.428 --> 00:11:26.152
don't keep quiet, pretending that you are 
understanding everything.

00:11:26.152 --> 00:11:28.772
No! Demand to understand. Ask.

00:11:28.772 --> 00:11:32.067
I know that this is not easy. Turn to the gentleman 
in the little suite and say:

00:11:32.067 --> 00:11:35.197
"Look here, this contract, this part, 
what does this mean?"

00:11:35.197 --> 00:11:39.411
It's not easy, and perhaps it's even a bit 
embarrassing, isn't it?

00:11:39.411 --> 00:11:41.444
But it is not. It's a sign of intelligence.

00:11:41.444 --> 00:11:44.984
What do you teach your children when 
they have doubts in school?

00:11:44.984 --> 00:11:48.573
"Don't say nothing to anyone, shut up really good 
and act smart."

00:11:48.573 --> 00:11:50.357
No, you don't, right? You say:

00:11:50.357 --> 00:11:54.216
"Look, when you don't understand, you put your hand 
up in the air and ask the teacher until you are cleared."

00:11:54.216 --> 00:11:58.220
And that is exactly what we have to do, 
as consumers and citizens.

00:11:58.220 --> 00:12:02.845
So, next time you come across with 
a document you don't understand,

00:12:02.845 --> 00:12:05.651
demand to understand, put aside your pride and ask

00:12:05.651 --> 00:12:07.791
until you get completely cleared.

00:12:07.791 --> 00:12:13.282
Then, there's the other side, which is:
"Okay, these awful documents

00:12:13.282 --> 00:12:15.389
"which are in circulation, they don't grow on trees.

00:12:15.389 --> 00:12:17.483
"Someone wrote them." Hum?

00:12:17.483 --> 00:12:21.986
Maybe, among this big group, some persons...

00:12:21.986 --> 00:12:26.639
I don't know, some lawyers, some public employees --
I'm not asking you to identify yourselves,

00:12:26.639 --> 00:12:29.172
but I ask you to search your own conscience.

00:12:29.172 --> 00:12:32.511
How many times do you write documents 
for the general public,

00:12:32.511 --> 00:12:35.127
for people that don't share your language,

00:12:35.127 --> 00:12:37.796
and you write them in a language that 
only you will understand?

00:12:37.796 --> 00:12:40.821
And you'll say: "Ah, that's because 
there is a reason, here!"

00:12:40.821 --> 00:12:42.413
Dear friends, I already heard all the reasons.

00:12:42.413 --> 00:12:45.178
There are thousands of reasons. They go like these:

00:12:45.178 --> 00:12:47.152
"Ah, it's the house's culture"; "Oh, my boss!"

00:12:47.152 --> 00:12:49.927
"Oh, the judge! And what if this goes to court?"

00:12:49.927 --> 00:12:52.508
"What you want is to destroy language. 
We have to educate people."

00:12:52.508 --> 00:12:54.483
"We can't lower the level"; bla, bla, bla...

00:12:54.483 --> 00:12:56.904
I've seen all of this. These are excuses.

00:12:56.904 --> 00:12:59.475
A while ago, they told us about Einstein.

00:12:59.475 --> 00:13:03.353
Einstein said this: "If you can't write about a subject,

00:13:03.353 --> 00:13:06.093
in a simple way, it's because, in fact, 
you don't understand it."

00:13:06.093 --> 00:13:09.637
So, if you... (Applause)

00:13:09.637 --> 00:13:11.547
To Einstein... (Applause)

00:13:11.547 --> 00:13:13.208
To Einstein...(Applause)

00:13:13.208 --> 00:13:15.907
So -- ah, ah, I don't have time! --

00:13:15.907 --> 00:13:20.479
so, if you do know what you want to say -- 
don't you? --

00:13:20.479 --> 00:13:22.645
you are aware of what you want to say,

00:13:22.645 --> 00:13:27.385
you just have to do one thing: believe that it is 
possible to write in a simple way.

00:13:27.385 --> 00:13:29.123
And how do you do that?

00:13:29.123 --> 00:13:33.034
It's very easy. You write to your grandmother. 
Hum?

00:13:33.034 --> 00:13:34.882
You write to your grandmother. I'm going 
to show grandma to you.

00:13:34.882 --> 00:13:37.192
(Laughter)

00:13:37.192 --> 00:13:38.951
You write with respect and without paternalism.

00:13:38.951 --> 00:13:42.450
And you use three techniques that I'm going 
to teach you. First of all:

00:13:42.450 --> 00:13:44.686
Start by the most important.

00:13:44.686 --> 00:13:48.565
Grandma has a lot to do. She is not going to read
three pages to get to the main idea.

00:13:48.565 --> 00:13:50.766
Start by the most important.

00:13:50.766 --> 00:13:54.438
Next, use short sentences, because grandma,

00:13:54.438 --> 00:13:55.648
like anyone of us,

00:13:55.648 --> 00:13:57.325
if you make very long sentences,

00:13:57.325 --> 00:13:59.859
she gets to the end and she can't remember what 
you said in the beginning, anymore.

00:13:59.859 --> 00:14:04.515
And lastly, the third, use plain words, those ones 
that grandma knows.

00:14:04.515 --> 00:14:06.833
Alright? It's easy!

00:14:06.833 --> 00:14:08.398
Before I leave,

00:14:08.398 --> 00:14:11.416
I would like to talk to you about "Clara" (Clear). 
"Clara" is a project of social responsibility.

00:14:11.416 --> 00:14:15.308
It has this mission: to change the way how public communication is made.

00:14:15.308 --> 00:14:16.239
What do we do?

00:14:16.239 --> 00:14:20.026
We are going to launch this year 
a collection of "Claro" guides,

00:14:20.026 --> 00:14:24.123
that is, we are going to pick very, very, 
very complex subjects and put them simple.

00:14:24.123 --> 00:14:26.303
We are going to start with the 
"Claro" Guide of Justice.

00:14:26.303 --> 00:14:30.170
I think it is an area... that comes in handy. 
(Applause)

00:14:30.170 --> 00:14:32.752
And now I'm going to follow Manuel [Forjaz]'s advise. 
If it's time to ask,

00:14:32.752 --> 00:14:35.766
whoever wants to sponsor the 
"Claro" Guide of Justice -- I don't know...

00:14:35.766 --> 00:14:38.834
for example, the EDP Foundation, or...ha? --

00:14:38.834 --> 00:14:41.712
come talk to me later.

00:14:41.712 --> 00:14:46.046
Another thing we will do is to grant prizes 
to the worse and best documents,

00:14:46.046 --> 00:14:49.565
because, indeed, there are people who are working
to communicate in a clearer way,

00:14:49.565 --> 00:14:50.814
and that have to be rewarded,

00:14:50.814 --> 00:14:54.407
and there are lazy people that do nothing 
about it and need to be humiliated.

00:14:54.407 --> 00:14:56.812
So, we'll give prizes to the worst and to the best.

00:14:56.812 --> 00:14:58.553
I'm counting on your help. (Applause)

00:14:58.553 --> 00:15:03.076
(Applause)

00:15:03.076 --> 00:15:07.091
We are going to launch... we are going to launch
the campaign via Clara's Facebook,

00:15:07.091 --> 00:15:10.182
so, send your friendship request and 
you'll be up to date.

00:15:10.182 --> 00:15:12.608
But, lastly, above all, what does "Clara" want?

00:15:12.608 --> 00:15:14.425
It wants to put two little things in your heads.

00:15:14.425 --> 00:15:18.069
The first one: demand to understand. Don't be shy.

00:15:18.069 --> 00:15:22.350
And write in order to be understood. 
Write to your grandma.

00:15:22.350 --> 00:15:26.766
And if you don't have a grandmother, write to 
Mr. Domingos, he will like it.

00:15:26.766 --> 00:15:29.643
Thank you. (Applause)
