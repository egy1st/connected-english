00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
So historically there has

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
been a huge divide between what people

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
consider to be non-living systems on one

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
side, and living systems on the other side.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
So we go from, say, this beautiful and

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
complex crystal as non-life, and this rather

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
beautiful and complex cat on the other side.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Over the last hundred and fifty years or so,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
science has kind of blurred this distinction

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
between non-living and living systems, and

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
now we consider that there may be a kind

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
of continuum that exists between the two.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
We'll just take one example here:

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
a virus is a natural system, right?

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
But it's very simple. It's very simplistic.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
It doesn't really satisfy all the requirements,

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
it doesn't have all the characteristics

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
of living systems and is in fact a parasite

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
on other living systems in order to, say,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
reproduce and evolve.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
But what we're going to be talking about here

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
tonight are experiments done on this sort of

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
non-living end of this spectrum -- so actually

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
doing chemical experiments in the laboratory,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
mixing together nonliving ingredients

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
to make new structures, and that these

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
new structures might have some of the

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
characteristics of living systems.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
Really what I'm talking about here is

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
trying to create a kind of artificial life.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
So what are these characteristics that I'm

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
talking about? These are them.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
We consider first that life has a body.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
Now this is necessary to distinguish the self

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
from the environment.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
Life also has a metabolism. Now this is a

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
process by which life can convert resources

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
from the environment into building blocks

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
so it can maintain and build itself.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
Life also has a kind of inheritable information.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
Now we, as humans, we store our information

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000
as DNA in our genomes and we pass this

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
information on to our offspring.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
If we couple the first two -- the body and the metabolism --

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
we can come up with a system that could

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
perhaps move and replicate, and if we

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
coupled these now to inheritable information,

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
we can come up with a system that would be

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
more lifelike, and would perhaps evolve.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
And so these are the things we will try to do

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
in the lab, make some experiments that have

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
one or more of these characteristics of life.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
So how do we do this? Well, we use

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
a model system that we term a protocell.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
You might think of this as kind of like a

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
primitive cell. It is a simple chemical

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000
model of a living cell, and if you consider

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
for example a cell in your body may have

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
on the order of millions of different types

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
of molecules that need to come together,

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
play together in a complex network

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000
to produce something that we call alive.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
In the laboratory what we want to do

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
is much the same, but with on the order of

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
tens of different types of molecules --

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
so a drastic reduction in complexity, but still

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
trying to produce something that looks lifelike.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
And so what we do is, we start simple

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000
and we work our way up to living systems.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
Consider for a moment this quote by

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
Leduc, a hundred years ago, considering a

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
kind of synthetic biology:

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
"The synthesis of life, should it ever occur,

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
will not be the sensational discovery which we

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
usually associate with the idea."

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
That's his first statement. So if we actually

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
create life in the laboratories, it's

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
probably not going to impact our lives at all.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
"If we accept the theory of evolution, then

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
the first dawn of synthesis of life must consist

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
in the production of forms intermediate

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
between the inorganic and the organic

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000
world, or between the non-living

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000
and living world, forms which possess

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000
only some of the rudimentary attributes of life"

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
-- so, the ones I just discussed --

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
"to which other attributes will be slowly added

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000
in the course of development by the

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
evolutionary actions of the environment."

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
So we start simple, we make some structures

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
that may have some of these characteristics

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
of life, and then we try to develop that

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000
to become more lifelike.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000
This is how we can start to make a protocell.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
We use this idea called self-assembly.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000
What that means is, I can mix some

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
chemicals together in a test tube in my lab,

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000
and these chemicals will start to self-associate

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000
to form larger and larger structures.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000
So say on the order of tens of thousands,

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000
hundreds of thousands of molecules will

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000
come together to form a large structure

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000
that didn't exist before.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000
And in this particular example,

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000
what I took is some membrane molecules,

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000
mixed those together in the right environment,

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000
and within seconds it forms these rather

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000
complex and beautiful structures here.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000
These membranes are also quite similar,

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000
morphologically and functionally,

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
to the membranes in your body,

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
and we can use these, as they say,

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000
to form the body of our protocell.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.000
Likewise,

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000
we can work with oil and water systems.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000
As you know, when you put oil and water together,

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000
they don't mix, but through self-assembly

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000
we can get a nice oil droplet to form,

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000
and we can actually use this as a body for

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000
our artificial organism or for our protocell,

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000
as you will see later.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000
So that's just forming some body stuff, right?

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000
Some architectures.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000
What about the other aspects of living systems?

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000
So we came up with this protocell model here

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
that I'm showing.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
We started with a natural occurring clay

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
called montmorillonite.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000
This is natural from the environment, this clay.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000
It forms a surface that is, say, chemically active.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000
It could run a metabolism on it.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000
Certain kind of molecules like to associate

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000
with the clay. For example, in this case, RNA, shown in red

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000
-- this is a relative of DNA,

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000
it's an informational molecule --

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000
it can come along and it starts to associate

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000
with the surface of this clay.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
This structure, then, can organize the

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000
formation of a membrane boundary around

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000
itself, so it can make a body of

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000
liquid molecules around itself, and that's

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000
shown in green here on this micrograph.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000
So just through self-assembly, mixing things

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.000
together in the lab, we can come up with, say,

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000
a metabolic surface with some

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000
informational molecules attached

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000
inside of this membrane body, right?

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:15.000
So we're on a road towards living systems.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000
But if you saw this protocell, you would not

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000
confuse this with something that was actually alive.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000
It's actually quite lifeless. Once it forms,

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000
it doesn't really do anything.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000
So, something is missing.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000
Some things are missing.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000
So some things that are missing is,

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000
for example, if you had a flow of energy

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.000
through a system, what we'd want

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.000
is a protocell that can harvest

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000
some of that energy in order to maintain itself,

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000
much like living systems do.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000
So we came up with a different protocell

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000
model, and this is actually simpler than the previous one.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000
In this protocell model, it's just an oil droplet,

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000
but a chemical metabolism inside

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.000
that allows this protocell to use energy

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.000
to do something, to actually become dynamic,

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.000
as we'll see here.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000
You add the droplet to the system.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000
It's a pool of water, and the protocell

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000
starts moving itself around in the system.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000
Okay? Oil droplet forms

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.000
through self-assembly, has a chemical

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.000
metabolism inside so it can use energy,

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000
and it uses that energy to move itself

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000
around in its environment.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000
As we heard earlier, movement is very

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000
important in these kinds of living systems.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.000
It is moving around, exploring its environment,

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.000
and remodeling its environment, as you see,

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000
by these chemical waves that are forming by the protocell.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000
So it's acting, in a sense, like a living system

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.000
trying to preserve itself.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:28.000
We take this same moving protocell here,

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000
and we put it in another experiment,

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000
get it moving. Then I'm going

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000
to add some food to the system,

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.000
and you'll see that in blue here, right?

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000
So I add some food source to the system.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.000
The protocell moves. It encounters the food.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.000
It reconfigures itself and actually then

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.000
is able to climb to the highest concentration

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000
of food in that system and stop there.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000
Alright? So not only do we have this system

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000
that has a body, it has a metabolism,

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.000
it can use energy, it moves around.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000
It can sense its local environment

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.000
and actually find resources

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000
in the environment to sustain itself.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000
Now, this doesn't have a brain, it doesn't have

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000
a neural system. This is just a sack of

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.000
chemicals that is able to have this interesting

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.000
and complex lifelike behavior.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.000
If we count the number of chemicals

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.000
in that system, actually, including the water

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.000
that's in the dish, we have five chemicals

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.000
that can do this.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.000
So then we put these protocells together in a

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.000
single experiment to see what they would do,

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.000
and depending on the conditions, we have

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.000
some protocells on the left that are

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.000
moving around and it likes to touch the other

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.000
structures in its environment.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000
On the other hand we have two moving

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000
protocells that like to circle each other,

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.000
and they form a kind of a dance, a complex dance with each other.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000
Right? So not only do individual protocells

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.000
have behavior, what we've interpreted as

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.000
behavior in this system, but we also have

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.000
basically population-level behavior

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:46.000
similar to what organisms have.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:49.000
So now that you're all experts on protocells,

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.000
we're going to play a game with these protocells.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.000
We're going to make two different kinds.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:56.000
Protocell A has a certain kind of chemistry

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.000
inside that, when activated, the protocell

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000
starts to vibrate around, just dancing.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000
So remember, these are primitive things,

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000
so dancing protocells, that's very

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.000
interesting to us. (Laughter)

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.000
The second protocell has a different

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.000
chemistry inside, and when activated,

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000
the protocells all come together and they fuse

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.000
into one big one. Right?

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.000
And we just put these two together

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.000
in the same system.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.000
So there's population A,

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.000
there's population B, and then

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.000
we activate the system,

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000
and protocell Bs, they're the blue ones,

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000
they all come together. They fuse together

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.000
to form one big blob, and the other protocell

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000
just dances around. And this just happens

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.000
until all of the energy in the system is

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:37.000
basically used up, and then, game over.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.000
So then I repeated this experiment

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.000
a bunch of times, and one time

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.000
something very interesting happened.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.000
So, I added these protocells together

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.000
to the system, and protocell A and protocell B

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.000
fused together to form a hybrid protocell AB.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000
That didn't happen before. There it goes.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:54.000
There's a protocell AB now in this system.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:57.000
Protocell AB likes to dance around for a bit,

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:00.000
while protocell B does the fusing, okay?

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.000
But then something even more interesting happens.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.000
Watch when these two large protocells,

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.000
the hybrid ones, fuse together.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:10.000
Now we have a dancing protocell

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:14.000
and a self-replication event. Right. (Laughter)

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.000
Just with blobs of chemicals, again.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.000
So the way this works is, you have

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.000
a simple system of five chemicals here,

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.000
a simple system here. When they hybridize,

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.000
you then form something that's different than

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.000
before, it's more complex than before,

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.000
and you get the emergence of another kind of

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.000
lifelike behavior which

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.000
in this case is replication.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.000
So since we can make some interesting

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.000
protocells that we like, interesting colors and

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.000
interesting behaviors, and they're very easy

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.000
to make, and they have interesting lifelike

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:43.000
properties, perhaps these protocells have

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.000
something to tell us about the origin of life

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.000
on the Earth. Perhaps these represent an

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.000
easily accessible step, one of the first steps

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:52.000
by which life got started on the early Earth.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.000
Certainly, there were molecules present on

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.000
the early Earth, but they wouldn't have been

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.000
these pure compounds that we worked with

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.000
in the lab and I showed in these experiments.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.000
Rather, they'd be a real complex mixture of

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.000
all kinds of stuff, because

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.000
uncontrolled chemical reactions produce

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.000
a diverse mixture of organic compounds.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:11.000
Think of it like a primordial ooze, okay?

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.000
And it's a pool that's too difficult to fully

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.000
characterize, even by modern methods, and

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:17.000
the product looks brown, like this tar here

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.000
on the left. A pure compound

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.000
is shown on the right, for contrast.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.000
So this is similar to what happens when you

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.000
take pure sugar crystals in your kitchen,

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.000
you put them in a pan, and you apply energy.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.000
You turn up the heat, you start making

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.000
or breaking chemical bonds in the sugar,

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:33.000
forming a brownish caramel, right?

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.000
If you let that go unregulated, you'll

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.000
continue to make and break chemical bonds,

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.000
forming an even more diverse mixture of

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.000
molecules that then forms this kind of black

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.000
tarry stuff in your pan, right, that's

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.000
difficult to wash out. So that's what

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.000
the origin of life would have looked like.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.000
You needed to get life out of this junk that

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.000
is present on the early Earth,

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:53.000
four, 4.5 billion years ago.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.000
So the challenge then is,

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.000
throw away all your pure chemicals in the lab,

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.000
and try to make some protocells with lifelike

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:02.000
properties from this kind of primordial ooze.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:04.000
So we're able to then see the self-assembly

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:06.000
of these oil droplet bodies again

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.000
that we've seen previously,

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.000
and the black spots inside of there

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.000
represent this kind of black tar -- this diverse,

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.000
very complex, organic black tar.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.000
And we put them into one of these

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.000
experiments, as you've seen earlier, and then

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.000
we watch lively movement that comes out.

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.000
They look really good, very nice movement,

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.000
and also they appear to have some kind of

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.000
behavior where they kind of circle

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:29.000
around each other and follow each other,

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.000
similar to what we've seen before -- but again,

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:33.000
working with just primordial conditions,

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.000
no pure chemicals.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:37.000
These are also, these tar-fueled protocells,

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.000
are also able to locate resources

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:40.000
in their environment.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:42.000
I'm going to add some resource from the left,

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:44.000
here, that defuses into the system,

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:46.000
and you can see, they really like that.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.000
They become very energetic, and able

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.000
to find the resource in the environment,

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.000
similar to what we saw before.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.000
But again, these are done in these primordial

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.000
conditions, really messy conditions,

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.000
not sort of sterile laboratory conditions.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.000
These are very dirty little protocells,

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.000
as a matter of fact. (Laughter)

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:05.000
But they have lifelike properties, is the point.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:08.000
So, doing these artificial life experiments

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:11.000
helps us define a potential path between

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:14.000
non-living and living systems.

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.000
And not only that, but it helps us

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.000
broaden our view of what life is

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.000
and what possible life there could be

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.000
out there -- life that could be very different

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:25.000
from life that we find here on Earth.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.000
And that leads me to the next

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:29.000
term, which is "weird life."

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:32.000
This is a term by Steve Benner.

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.000
This is used in reference to a report

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.000
in 2007 by the National Research Council

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.000
in the United States, wherein

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.000
they tried to understand how we can

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:42.000
look for life elsewhere in the universe, okay,

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:44.000
especially if that life is very different from life

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:47.000
on Earth. If we went to another planet and

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:49.000
we thought there might be life there,

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:51.000
how could we even recognize it as life?

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.000
Well, they came up with three very general

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.000
criteria. First is -- and they're listed here.

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.000
The first is, the system has to be in

00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:59.000
non-equilibrium. That means the system

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:00.000
cannot be dead, in a matter of fact.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.000
Basically what that means is, you have

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:04.000
an input of energy into the system that life

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:07.000
can use and exploit to maintain itself.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:09.000
This is similar to having the Sun shining

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:11.000
on the Earth, driving photosynthesis,

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:13.000
driving the ecosystem.

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:15.000
Without the Sun, there's likely to be

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:17.000
no life on this planet.

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:19.000
Secondly, life needs to be in liquid form,

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:21.000
so that means even if we had some

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.000
interesting structures, interesting molecules

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:25.000
together but they were frozen solid,

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:27.000
then this is not a good place for life.

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:29.000
And thirdly, we need to be able to make

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:31.000
and break chemical bonds. And again

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.000
this is important because life transforms

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:35.000
resources from the environment into

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:37.000
building blocks so it can maintain itself.

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:39.000
Now today, I told you about very strange

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:41.000
and weird protocells -- some that contain clay,

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:44.000
some that have primordial ooze in them,

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:46.000
some that have basically oil

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.000
instead of water inside of them.

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.000
Most of these don't contain DNA,

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.000
but yet they have lifelike properties.

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:55.000
But these protocells satisfy

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:58.000
these general requirements of living systems.

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:00.000
So by making these chemical, artificial

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.000
life experiments, we hope not only

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.000
to understand something fundamental

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:06.000
about the origin of life and the existence

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:08.000
of life on this planet, but also

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:10.000
what possible life there could be

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:13.000
out there in the universe. Thank you.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:17.000
(Applause)
