00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Hi. Today, I'm going to take you through glimpses

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
of about eight of my projects,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
done in collaboration with Danish artist Soren Pors.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
We call ourselves Pors and Rao,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
and we live and work in India.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
I'd like to begin with my very first object,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
which I call "The Uncle Phone."

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
And it was inspired by my uncle's peculiar habit

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
of constantly asking me to do things for him,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
almost like I were an extension of his body --

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
to turn on the lights or to bring him a glass of water,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
a pack of cigarettes.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
And as I grew up, it became worse and worse,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
And I started to think of it as a form of control.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
But of course, I could never say anything,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
because the uncle is a respected figure

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
in the Indian family.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
And the situation that irked me and mystified me the most

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
was his use of a landline telephone.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
He would hold on to the receiver and expect me to dial a number for him.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
And so as a response and as a gift to my uncle,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
I made him "The Uncle Phone."

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
It's so long that it requires two people to use it.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000
It's exactly the way my uncle uses a phone that's designed for one person.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
But the problem is that, when I left home and went to college,

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
I started missing his commands.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
And so I made him a golden typewriter

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
through which he could dispense his commands

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
to nephews and nieces around the world as an email.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
So what he had to do was take a piece of paper, roll it into the carriage,

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
type his email or command and pull the paper out.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
This device would automatically send the intended person

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
the letter as an email.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
So here you can see, we embedded a lot of electronics

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
that understands all of the mechanical actions

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
and converts it to digital.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
So my uncle is only dealing with a mechanical interface.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
And of course, the object had to be very grand and have a sense of ritualism,

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
the way my uncle likes it.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
The next work is a sound-sensitive installation

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
that we affectionately call "The Pygmies."

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
And we wanted to work with a notion of being

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.000
surrounded by a tribe of very shy, sensitive and sweet creatures.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
So how it works is we have these panels, which we have on the wall,

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
and behind them, we have these little creatures which hide.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
And as soon as it's silent, they sort of creep out.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
And if it's even more silent, they stretch their necks out.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
And at the slightest sound, they hide back again.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
So we had these panels on three walls of a room.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
And we had over 500 of these little pygmies hiding behind them.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
So this is how it works.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
This is a video prototype.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000
So when it's quiet, it's sort of coming out from behind the panels.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
And they hear like humans do, or real creatures do.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000
So they get immune to sounds that scare them after awhile.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000
And they don't react to background sounds.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000
You'll hear a train in moment that they don't react to.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
(Noise)

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
But they react to foreground sounds. You'll hear that in a second.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
(Whistling)

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
So we worked very hard

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000
to make them as lifelike as possible.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
So each pygmy has its own behavior, psyche,

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000
mood swings, personalities and so on.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
So this is a very early prototype.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
Of course, it got much better after that.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000
And we made them react to people,

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.000
but we found that people were being quite playful and childlike with them.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000
This is a video installation called "The Missing Person."

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
And we were quite intrigued

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000
with playing with the notion of invisibility.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000
How would it be possible to experience a sense of invisibility?

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
So we worked with a company

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
that specializes in camera surveillance,

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000
and we asked them to develop a piece of software with us,

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
using a camera

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
that could look at people in the room, track them

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000
and replace one person with the background, rendering them invisible.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.000
So I'm just going to show you a very early prototype.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000
On the right side you can see my colleague Soren,

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
who's actually in the space.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000
And on the left side, you'll see the processed video

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.000
where the camera has made him invisible.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000
Soren enters the room. Pop! He goes invisible.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000
And you can see that the camera is tracking him and erasing.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000
It's a very early video,

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000
so we haven't yet dealt with the overlap and all of that,

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000
but that got refined pretty soon, later.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000
So how we used it was in a room where we had a camera looking into the space,

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.000
and we had one monitor, one on each wall.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000
And as people walked into the room,

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.000
they would see themselves in the monitor, except with one difference:

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000
one person was constantly invisible

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000
wherever they moved in the room.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
So this is a work called "The Sun Shadow."

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.000
And it was almost like a sheet of paper,

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000
like a cutout of a childlike drawing

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000
of an oil spill or a sun.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000
And from the front, this object appeared to be very strong and robust,

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000
and from the side, it almost seemed very weak.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000
So people would walking into the room and they'd almost ignore it,

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000
thinking it was some crap laying around.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000
But as soon as they passed by,

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000
it would start to climb up the wall in jerky fashion.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000
And it would get exhausted, and it would collapse every time.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000
(Laughter)

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000
So this work

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000
is a caricature of an upside-down man.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000
His head is so heavy, full of heavy thoughts,

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000
that it's sort of fallen into his hat,

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000
and his body's grown out of him almost like a plant.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000
Well what he does is he moves around

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000
in a very drunken fashion on his head

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.000
in a very unpredictable and extremely slow movement.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.000
And it's kind of constrained by that circle.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.000
Because if that circle weren't there, and the floor was very even,

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000
it would start to wander about in the space.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000
And there's no wires.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000
So I'll just show you an instance --

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000
so when people enter the room, it activates this object.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000
And it very slowly, over a few minutes,

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000
sort of painfully goes up,

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000
and then it gains momentum

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000
and it looks like it's almost about to fall.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000
And this is an important moment,

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000
because we wanted to instill in the viewer

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000
an instinct to almost go and help, or save the subject.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000
But it doesn't really need it,

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.000
because it, again, sort of manages to pull itself up.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.000
So this work was a real technical challenge for us,

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.000
and we worked very hard, like most of our works, over years

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.000
to get the mechanics right and the equilibrium and the dynamics.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000
And it was very important for us

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000
to establish the exact moment that it would fall,

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.000
because if we made it in a way that it would topple over,

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.000
then it would damage itself,

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.000
and if it didn't fall enough, it wouldn't instill that fatalism,

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000
or that sense of wanting to go and help it.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000
So I'm going to show you a very quick video

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000
where we are doing a test scenario -- it's much faster.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.000
That's my colleague. He's let it go.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000
Now he's getting nervous, so he's going to go catch it.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000
But he doesn't need to,

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.000
because it manages to lift itself up on its own.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.000
So this is a work that we were very intrigued with,

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000
working with the aesthetic of fur

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000
embedded with thousands of tiny different sizes

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.000
of fiber optics, which twinkle like the night sky.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000
And it's at the scale of the night sky.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000
So we wrapped this around a blob-like form,

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000
which is in the shape of a teddy bear,

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000
which was hanging from the ceiling.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.000
And the idea was to sort of contrast

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.000
something very cold and distant and abstract like the universe

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.000
into the familiar form of a teddy bear,

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.000
which is very comforting and intimate.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.000
And the idea was that at some point

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000
you would stop looking at the form of a teddy bear

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.000
and you would almost perceive it to be a hole in the space,

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.000
and as if you were looking out into the twinkling night sky.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000
So this is the last work, and a work in progress,

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.000
and it's called "Space Filler."

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.000
Well imagine a small cube that's about this big

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000
standing in front of you in the middle of the room,

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.000
and as you approached it, it tried to intimidate you

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000
by growing into a cube

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.000
that's twice its height and [eight] times its volume.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.000
And so this object is constantly expanding and contracting

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000
to create a dynamic with people moving around it --

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.000
almost like it were trying

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.000
to conceal a secret within its seams or something.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.000
So we work with a lot of technology,

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000
but we don't really love technology,

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:07.000
because it gives us a lot of pain in our work over years and years.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000
But we use it because we're interested

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000
in the way that it can help us

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.000
to express the emotions and behavioral patterns

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.000
in these creatures that we create.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.000
And once a creature pops into our minds,

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.000
it's almost like the process of creation

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:23.000
is to discover the way this creature really wants to exist

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.000
and what form it wants to take and what way it wants to move.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.000
Thank you.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000
(Applause)
