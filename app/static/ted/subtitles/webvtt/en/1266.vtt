00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:05.000
I'd like to start with a short story.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
It's about a little boy

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.000
whose father was a history buff

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
and who used to take him by the hand

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
to visit the ruins of an ancient metropolis

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
on the outskirts of their camp.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
They would always stop by to visit

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
these huge winged bulls that used to guard

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
the gates of that ancient metropolis,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
and the boy used to be scared

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
of these winged bulls,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
but at the same time they excited him.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
And the dad used to use those bulls

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
to tell the boy stories about

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
that civilization and their work.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
Let's fast-forward to the

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
San Francisco Bay Area many decades later,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
where I started a technology company

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
that brought the world its first

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
3D laser scanning system.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
Let me show you how it works.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
Female Voice: Long range laser scanning

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
by sending out a pulse that's a laser beam of light.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
The system measures the beam's time of flight,

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
recording the time it takes for the light

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
to hit a surface and make its return.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
With two mirrors, the scanner calculates

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
the beam's horizontal and vertical angles,

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
giving accurate x, y, and z coordinates.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
The point is then recorded

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.000
into a 3D visualization program.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
All of this happens in seconds.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
Ben Kacyra: You can see here,

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
these systems are extremely fast.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
They collect millions of points at a time

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
with very high accuracy

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
and very high resolution.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
A surveyor with traditional survey tools

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
would be hard-pressed to produce

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
maybe 500 points in a whole day.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
These babies would be producing

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
something like ten thousand points a second.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
So, as you can imagine,

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
this was a paradigm shift

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
in the survey and construction

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
as well as in reality capture industry.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000
Approximately ten years ago,

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000
my wife and I started a foundation to do good,

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
and right about that time,

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000
the magnificent Bamiyan Buddhas,

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000
hundred and eighty foot tall in Afghanistan,

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000
were blown up by the Taliban.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
They were gone in an instant.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
And unfortunately, there was

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
no detailed documentation of these Buddhas.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
This clearly devastated me,

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
and I couldn't help but wonder about

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000
the fate of my old friends, the winged bulls,

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000
and the fate of the many, many

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000
heritage sites all over the world.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
Both my wife and I

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
were so touched by this

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
that we decided to

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000
expand the mission of our foundation

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.000
to include digital heritage preservation

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
of world sites.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000
We called the project CyArk,

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000
which stands for Cyber Archive.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
To date, with the help of

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000
a global network of partners,

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
we've completed close to fifty projects.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
Let me show you some of them:

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000
Chichen Itza,

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000
Rapa Nui --

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000
and what you're seeing here

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
are the cloud of points --

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
Babylon,

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
Rosslyn Chapel,

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
Pompeii,

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
and our latest project, Mt. Rushmore,

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000
which happened to be one of

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000
our most challenging projects.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000
As you see here, we had to develop

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.000
a special rig to bring the scanner

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.000
up close and personal.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000
The results of our work in the field

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000
are used to produce

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000
media and deliverables to be used

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000
by conservators and researchers.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.000
We also produce media for

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000
dissemination to the public --

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.000
free through the CyArk website.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.000
These would be used for education,

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000
cultural tourism, etc.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000
What you're looking at in here

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.000
is a 3D viewer that we developed

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000
that would allow the display

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000
and manipulation of [the] cloud of points

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.000
in real time, cutting sections through them

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000
and extracting dimensions.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.000
This happens to be the cloud of points

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:26.000
for Tikal.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
In here you see a traditional 2D

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
architectural engineering drawing

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000
that's used for preservation, and of course

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000
we tell the stories through fly-throughs.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000
And here, this is a fly-through

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000
the cloud of points of Tikal,

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.000
and here you see it rendered

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000
and photo-textured with the photography

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000
that we take of the site.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000
And so this is not a video.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
This is actual 3D points with

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.000
two to three millimeter accuracy.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000
And of course the data can be used

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.000
to develop 3D models that are

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.000
very accurate and very detailed.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000
And here you're looking at a model

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000
that's extracted from the cloud of points

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000
for Stirling Castle.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.000
It's used for studies, for visualization,

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.000
as well as for education.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000
And finally, we produce mobile apps

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.000
that include narrated virtual tools.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.000
The more I got involved

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000
in the heritage field,

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000
the more it became clear to me

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000
that we are losing the sites

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.000
and the stories faster than we can

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.000
physically preserve them.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000
Of course, earthquakes

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000
and all the natural phenomena --

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000
floods, tornadoes, etc. --

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.000
take their toll.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.000
However, what occurred to me was

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000
human-caused destruction, which was

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.000
not only causing a significant portion

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.000
of the destruction, but actually

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.000
it was accelerating.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.000
This includes arson,

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000
urban sprawl,

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.000
acid rain, not to mention

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000
terrorism and wars.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.000
It was getting more and more apparent

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000
that we're fighting a losing battle.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000
We're losing our sites

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.000
and the stories,

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.000
and basically we're losing

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.000
a piece -- and a significant piece --

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.000
of our collective memory.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000
Imagine us as a human race

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:32.000
not knowing where we came from.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.000
Luckily, in the last two or three decades,

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.000
digital technologies have been developing

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.000
that have helped us to develop tools

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000
that we've brought to bear

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000
in the digital preservation,

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.000
in our digital preservation war.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.000
This includes, for example,

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:52.000
the 3D laser scanning systems,

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:55.000
ever more powerful personal computers,

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.000
3D graphics,

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.000
high-definition digital photography,

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.000
not to mention the Internet.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.000
Because of this accelerated

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.000
pace of destruction,

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000
it became clear to us that we needed

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.000
to challenge ourselves and our partners

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.000
to accelerate our work.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.000
And we created a project

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:19.000
we call the CyArk 500 Challenge --

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:22.000
and that is to digitally preserve

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:25.000
500 World Heritage Sites

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.000
in five years.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000
We do have the technology

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000
that's scaleable,

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:35.000
and our network of global partners

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.000
has been expanding and can be expanded

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.000
at a rapid rate,

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.000
so we're comfortable

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:45.000
that this task can be accomplished.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.000
However, to me, the 500 is

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:52.000
really just the first 500.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:56.000
In order to sustain our work into the future,

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:59.000
we use technology centers

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:02.000
where we partner with

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000
local universities and colleges

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:07.000
to take the technology to them,

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:10.000
whereby they then can help us

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:13.000
with digital preservation of their heritage sites,

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:16.000
and at the same time, it gives them

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:20.000
the technology to benefit from in the future.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:24.000
Let me close with another short story.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000
Two years ago, we were approached

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:29.000
by a partner of ours to digitally preserve

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000
an important heritage site,

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:34.000
a UNESCO heritage site in Uganda,

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:37.000
the Royal Kasubi Tombs.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:40.000
The work was done successfully in the field,

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000
and the data was archived

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.000
and publicly disseminated

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:47.000
through the CyArk website.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.000
Last March,

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:52.000
we received very sad news.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:55.000
The Royal Tombs had been destroyed

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:58.000
by suspected arson.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:01.000
A few days later, we received a call:

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:04.000
"Is the data available

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:08.000
and can it be used for reconstruction?"

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:11.000
Our answer, of course, was yes.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:16.000
Let me leave you with a final thought.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:19.000
Our heritage is much more than

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.000
our collective memory --

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.000
it's our collective treasure.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:26.000
We owe it to our children,

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.000
our grandchildren and the generations

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:31.000
we will never meet

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.000
to keep it safe

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.000
and to pass it along.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.000
Thank you.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.000
(Applause)

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.000
Thank you.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.000
Thank you.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:54.000
Thank you.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:58.000
Well, I'm staying here because

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:01.000
we wanted to demonstrate to you

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:04.000
the power of this technology

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:07.000
and so, while I've been speaking,

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:10.000
you have been scanned.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:13.000
(Laughter)

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:17.000
The two wizards that I have

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.000
that are behind the curtain

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:22.000
will help me bring

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:27.000
the results on the screen.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:37.000
(Applause)

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:40.000
This is all in 3D and of course

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:43.000
you can fly through the cloud of points.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.000
You can look at it from on top,

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.000
from the ceiling.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.000
You can look from different vantage points,

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:52.000
but I'm going to ask Doug to zoom in

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:55.000
on an individual in the crowd,

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:58.000
just to show the amount of detail

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:01.000
that we can create.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:07.000
So you have been digitally preserved

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.000
in about four minutes.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.000
(Laughter)

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:15.000
I'd like to thank the wizards here.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:18.000
We were very lucky to have

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:22.000
two of our partners participate in this:

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.000
the Historic Scotland,

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:27.000
and the Glasgow School of Art.

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:31.000
I'd like to also thank personally

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:35.000
the efforts of David Mitchell,

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:38.000
who is the Director of Conservation

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.000
at Historic Scotland.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:42.000
David.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:45.000
(Applause)

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.000
And Doug Pritchard, who's the Head of

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:52.000
Visualization at the Glasgow School of Art.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.000
Let's give them a hand.

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:57.000
(Applause)

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:00.000
Thank you.
