00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Humans have long held a fascination

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
for the human brain.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
We chart it, we've described it,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
we've drawn it,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
we've mapped it.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Now just like the physical maps of our world

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
that have been highly influenced by technology --

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
think Google Maps,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
think GPS --

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
the same thing is happening for brain mapping

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
through transformation.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
So let's take a look at the brain.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Most people, when they first look at a fresh human brain,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
they say, "It doesn't look what you're typically looking at

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
when someone shows you a brain."

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Typically, what you're looking at is a fixed brain. It's gray.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
And this outer layer, this is the vasculature,

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
which is incredible, around a human brain.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
This is the blood vessels.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
20 percent of the oxygen

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
coming from your lungs,

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
20 percent of the blood pumped from your heart,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
is servicing this one organ.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
That's basically, if you hold two fists together,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
it's just slightly larger than the two fists.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
Scientists, sort of at the end of the 20th century,

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
learned that they could track blood flow

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
to map non-invasively

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
where activity was going on in the human brain.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
So for example, they can see in the back part of the brain,

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
which is just turning around there.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
There's the cerebellum; that's keeping you upright right now.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
It's keeping me standing. It's involved in coordinated movement.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
On the side here, this is temporal cortex.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
This is the area where primary auditory processing --

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
so you're hearing my words,

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
you're sending it up into higher language processing centers.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
Towards the front of the brain

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
is the place in which all of the more complex thought, decision making --

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.000
it's the last to mature in late adulthood.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
This is where all your decision-making processes are going on.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
It's the place where you're deciding right now

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
you probably aren't going to order the steak for dinner.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
So if you take a deeper look at the brain,

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
one of the things, if you look at it in cross-section,

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
what you can see

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
is that you can't really see a whole lot of structure there.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
But there's actually a lot of structure there.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
It's cells and it's wires all wired together.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
So about a hundred years ago,

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
some scientists invented a stain that would stain cells.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
And that's shown here in the the very light blue.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
You can see areas

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
where neuronal cell bodies are being stained.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
And what you can see is it's very non-uniform. You see a lot more structure there.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
So the outer part of that brain

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
is the neocortex.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000
It's one continuous processing unit, if you will.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
But you can also see things underneath there as well.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
And all of these blank areas

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
are the areas in which the wires are running through.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
They're probably less cell dense.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000
So there's about 86 billion neurons in our brain.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000
And as you can see, they're very non-uniformly distributed.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
And how they're distributed really contributes

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
to their underlying function.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
And of course, as I mentioned before,

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000
since we can now start to map brain function,

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000
we can start to tie these into the individual cells.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
So let's take a deeper look.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
Let's look at neurons.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
So as I mentioned, there are 86 billion neurons.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
There are also these smaller cells as you'll see.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
These are support cells -- astrocytes glia.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
And the nerves themselves

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
are the ones who are receiving input.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
They're storing it, they're processing it.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.000
Each neuron is connected via synapses

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000
to up to 10,000 other neurons in your brain.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000
And each neuron itself

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
is largely unique.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
The unique character of both individual neurons

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
and neurons within a collection of the brain

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000
are driven by fundamental properties

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
of their underlying biochemistry.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
These are proteins.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.000
They're proteins that are controlling things like ion channel movement.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.000
They're controlling who nervous system cells partner up with.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000
And they're controlling

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000
basically everything that the nervous system has to do.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.000
So if we zoom in to an even deeper level,

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000
all of those proteins

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000
are encoded by our genomes.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000
We each have 23 pairs of chromosomes.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000
We get one from mom, one from dad.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000
And on these chromosomes

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000
are roughly 25,000 genes.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000
They're encoded in the DNA.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.000
And the nature of a given cell

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000
driving its underlying biochemistry

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000
is dictated by which of these 25,000 genes

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000
are turned on

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000
and at what level they're turned on.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000
And so our project

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000
is seeking to look at this readout,

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000
understanding which of these 25,000 genes is turned on.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000
So in order to undertake such a project,

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.000
we obviously need brains.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000
So we sent our lab technician out.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000
We were seeking normal human brains.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
What we actually start with

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
is a medical examiner's office.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
This a place where the dead are brought in.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000
We are seeking normal human brains.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.000
There's a lot of criteria by which we're selecting these brains.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000
We want to make sure

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.000
that we have normal humans between the ages of 20 to 60,

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000
they died a somewhat natural death

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000
with no injury to the brain,

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000
no history of psychiatric disease,

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000
no drugs on board --

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
we do a toxicology workup.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000
And we're very careful

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000
about the brains that we do take.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000
We're also selecting for brains

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000
in which we can get the tissue,

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000
we can get consent to take the tissue

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000
within 24 hours of time of death.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.000
Because what we're trying to measure, the RNA --

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000
which is the readout from our genes --

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000
is very labile,

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000
and so we have to move very quickly.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.000
One side note on the collection of brains:

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000
because of the way that we collect,

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000
and because we require consent,

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.000
we actually have a lot more male brains than female brains.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.000
Males are much more likely to die an accidental death in the prime of their life.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000
And men are much more likely

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.000
to have their significant other, spouse, give consent

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.000
than the other way around.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:37.000
(Laughter)

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000
So the first thing that we do at the site of collection

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000
is we collect what's called an MR.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000
This is magnetic resonance imaging -- MRI.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.000
It's a standard template by which we're going to hang the rest of this data.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.000
So we collect this MR.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000
And you can think of this as our satellite view for our map.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000
The next thing we do

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.000
is we collect what's called a diffusion tensor imaging.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000
This maps the large cabling in the brain.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.000
And again, you can think of this

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000
as almost mapping our interstate highways, if you will.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.000
The brain is removed from the skull,

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.000
and then it's sliced into one-centimeter slices.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000
And those are frozen solid,

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000
and they're shipped to Seattle.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000
And in Seattle, we take these --

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000
this is a whole human hemisphere --

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.000
and we put them into what's basically a glorified meat slicer.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.000
There's a blade here that's going to cut across

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000
a section of the tissue

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000
and transfer it to a microscope slide.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000
We're going to then apply one of those stains to it,

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000
and we scan it.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.000
And then what we get is our first mapping.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000
So this is where experts come in

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.000
and they make basic anatomic assignments.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.000
You could consider this state boundaries, if you will,

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.000
those pretty broad outlines.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:42.000
From this, we're able to then fragment that brain into further pieces,

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000
which then we can put on a smaller cryostat.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.000
And this is just showing this here --

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.000
this frozen tissue, and it's being cut.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.000
This is 20 microns thin, so this is about a baby hair's width.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000
And remember, it's frozen.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000
And so you can see here,

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.000
old-fashioned technology of the paintbrush being applied.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.000
We take a microscope slide.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.000
Then we very carefully melt onto the slide.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000
This will then go onto a robot

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:07.000
that's going to apply one of those stains to it.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.000
And our anatomists are going to go in and take a deeper look at this.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.000
So again this is what they can see under the microscope.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.000
You can see collections and configurations

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.000
of large and small cells

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.000
in clusters and various places.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.000
And from there it's routine. They understand where to make these assignments.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.000
And they can make basically what's a reference atlas.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000
This is a more detailed map.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000
Our scientists then use this

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:34.000
to go back to another piece of that tissue

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000
and do what's called laser scanning microdissection.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.000
So the technician takes the instructions.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.000
They scribe along a place there.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.000
And then the laser actually cuts.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:46.000
You can see that blue dot there cutting. And that tissue falls off.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.000
You can see on the microscope slide here,

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.000
that's what's happening in real time.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:53.000
There's a container underneath that's collecting that tissue.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.000
We take that tissue,

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.000
we purify the RNA out of it

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.000
using some basic technology,

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.000
and then we put a florescent tag on it.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.000
We take that tagged material

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.000
and we put it on to something called a microarray.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.000
Now this may look like a bunch of dots to you,

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.000
but each one of these individual dots

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000
is actually a unique piece of the human genome

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.000
that we spotted down on glass.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:17.000
This has roughly 60,000 elements on it,

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:20.000
so we repeatedly measure various genes

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.000
of the 25,000 genes in the genome.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:25.000
And when we take a sample and we hybridize it to it,

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.000
we get a unique fingerprint, if you will,

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:30.000
quantitatively of what genes are turned on in that sample.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000
Now we do this over and over again,

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:35.000
this process for any given brain.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:38.000
We're taking over a thousand samples for each brain.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:41.000
This area shown here is an area called the hippocampus.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.000
It's involved in learning and memory.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:46.000
And it contributes to about 70 samples

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.000
of those thousand samples.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:52.000
So each sample gets us about 50,000 data points

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:55.000
with repeat measurements, a thousand samples.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.000
So roughly, we have 50 million data points

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.000
for a given human brain.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.000
We've done right now

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.000
two human brains-worth of data.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.000
We've put all of that together

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.000
into one thing,

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.000
and I'll show you what that synthesis looks like.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.000
It's basically a large data set of information

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.000
that's all freely available to any scientist around the world.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:18.000
They don't even have to log in to come use this tool,

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:22.000
mine this data, find interesting things out with this.

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:25.000
So here's the modalities that we put together.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:28.000
You'll start to recognize these things from what we've collected before.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.000
Here's the MR. It provides the framework.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:33.000
There's an operator side on the right that allows you to turn,

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.000
it allows you to zoom in,

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:38.000
it allows you to highlight individual structures.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.000
But most importantly,

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:43.000
we're now mapping into this anatomic framework,

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:46.000
which is a common framework for people to understand where genes are turned on.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.000
So the red levels

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.000
are where a gene is turned on to a great degree.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:53.000
Green is the sort of cool areas where it's not turned on.

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.000
And each gene gives us a fingerprint.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:10:00.000
And remember that we've assayed all the 25,000 genes in the genome

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:04.000
and have all of that data available.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.000
So what can scientists learn about this data?

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:09.000
We're just starting to look at this data ourselves.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:12.000
There's some basic things that you would want to understand.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.000
Two great examples are drugs,

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.000
Prozac and Wellbutrin.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:19.000
These are commonly prescribed antidepressants.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.000
Now remember, we're assaying genes.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:24.000
Genes send the instructions to make proteins.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.000
Proteins are targets for drugs.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.000
So drugs bind to proteins

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.000
and either turn them off, etc.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.000
So if you want to understand the action of drugs,

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:35.000
you want to understand how they're acting in the ways you want them to,

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.000
and also in the ways you don't want them to.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.000
In the side effect profile, etc.,

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.000
you want to see where those genes are turned on.

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.000
And for the first time, we can actually do that.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:46.000
We can do that in multiple individuals that we've assayed too.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:49.000
So now we can look throughout the brain.

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.000
We can see this unique fingerprint.

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:53.000
And we get confirmation.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:56.000
We get confirmation that, indeed, the gene is turned on --

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.000
for something like Prozac,

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:01.000
in serotonergic structures, things that are already known be affected --

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:03.000
but we also get to see the whole thing.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:05.000
We also get to see areas that no one has ever looked at before,

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:07.000
and we see these genes turned on there.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:10.000
It's as interesting a side effect as it could be.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.000
One other thing you can do with such a thing

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:15.000
is you can, because it's a pattern matching exercise,

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.000
because there's unique fingerprint,

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.000
we can actually scan through the entire genome

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.000
and find other proteins

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.000
that show a similar fingerprint.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:26.000
So if you're in drug discovery, for example,

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.000
you can go through

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.000
an entire listing of what the genome has on offer

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:34.000
to find perhaps better drug targets and optimize.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.000
Most of you are probably familiar

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.000
with genome-wide association studies

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:41.000
in the form of people covering in the news

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:44.000
saying, "Scientists have recently discovered the gene or genes

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:46.000
which affect X."

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.000
And so these kinds of studies

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.000
are routinely published by scientists

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.000
and they're great. They analyze large populations.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.000
They look at their entire genomes,

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.000
and they try to find hot spots of activity

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:59.000
that are linked causally to genes.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.000
But what you get out of such an exercise

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.000
is simply a list of genes.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:06.000
It tells you the what, but it doesn't tell you the where.

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:09.000
And so it's very important for those researchers

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:11.000
that we've created this resource.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.000
Now they can come in

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:15.000
and they can start to get clues about activity.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:17.000
They can start to look at common pathways --

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:20.000
other things that they simply haven't been able to do before.

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:24.000
So I think this audience in particular

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:27.000
can understand the importance of individuality.

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:29.000
And I think every human,

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:33.000
we all have different genetic backgrounds,

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:35.000
we all have lived separate lives.

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:37.000
But the fact is

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:40.000
our genomes are greater than 99 percent similar.

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:43.000
We're similar at the genetic level.

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:45.000
And what we're finding

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:47.000
is actually, even at the brain biochemical level,

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:49.000
we are quite similar.

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:51.000
And so this shows it's not 99 percent,

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.000
but it's roughly 90 percent correspondence

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:56.000
at a reasonable cutoff,

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.000
so everything in the cloud is roughly correlated.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.000
And then we find some outliers,

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:03.000
some things that lie beyond the cloud.

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:05.000
And those genes are interesting,

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:07.000
but they're very subtle.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:10.000
So I think it's an important message

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.000
to take home today

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:15.000
that even though we celebrate all of our differences,

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:17.000
we are quite similar

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:19.000
even at the brain level.

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:21.000
Now what do those differences look like?

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.000
This is an example of a study that we did

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:25.000
to follow up and see what exactly those differences were --

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:27.000
and they're quite subtle.

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:31.000
These are things where genes are turned on in an individual cell type.

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:34.000
These are two genes that we found as good examples.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:37.000
One is called RELN -- it's involved in early developmental cues.

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:39.000
DISC1 is a gene

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:41.000
that's deleted in schizophrenia.

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:43.000
These aren't schizophrenic individuals,

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:46.000
but they do show some population variation.

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.000
And so what you're looking at here

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.000
in donor one and donor four,

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.000
which are the exceptions to the other two,

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:54.000
that genes are being turned on

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.000
in a very specific subset of cells.

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:59.000
It's this dark purple precipitate within the cell

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:02.000
that's telling us a gene is turned on there.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.000
Whether or not that's due

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:06.000
to an individual's genetic background or their experiences,

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:08.000
we don't know.

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:11.000
Those kinds of studies require much larger populations.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:15.000
So I'm going to leave you with a final note

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:18.000
about the complexity of the brain

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:20.000
and how much more we have to go.

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:22.000
I think these resources are incredibly valuable.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:24.000
They give researchers a handle

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.000
on where to go.

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:29.000
But we only looked at a handful of individuals at this point.

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:31.000
We're certainly going to be looking at more.

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:33.000
I'll just close by saying

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:35.000
that the tools are there,

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:39.000
and this is truly an unexplored, undiscovered continent.

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:43.000
This is the new frontier, if you will.

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:45.000
And so for those who are undaunted,

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:47.000
but humbled by the complexity of the brain,

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:49.000
the future awaits.

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:51.000
Thanks.

00:14:51.000 --> 00:15:00.000
(Applause)
