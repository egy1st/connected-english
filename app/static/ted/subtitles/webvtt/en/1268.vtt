00:00:00.842 --> 00:00:05.696
Have you ever been in the position
of watching Silicon Valley take off

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:10.053
and wish that you had known
what was about to happen?

00:00:10.077 --> 00:00:12.126
(Laughter)

00:00:13.929 --> 00:00:16.928
So, I'm here to talk about
what I think is going to be

00:00:16.952 --> 00:00:21.986
the most intense disruption
of the technology world

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:23.958
that's occurred in the last 15 years.

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:30.047
And I believe the end product of it
will be entirely about engagement.

00:00:30.476 --> 00:00:34.609
In fact, I think it is possibly
a transformational change

00:00:34.633 --> 00:00:37.407
in the way we're going
to think about engagement.

00:00:37.431 --> 00:00:42.716
So what would you do if you knew today

00:00:43.978 --> 00:00:46.376
that there was going to be
a major technology cycle

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:48.183
beginning in the next couple years,

00:00:48.207 --> 00:00:50.066
and that you could participate in it?

00:00:50.411 --> 00:00:52.472
What would you do?

00:00:52.789 --> 00:00:53.955
(Audience) Jump in!

00:00:53.979 --> 00:00:57.429
So, this is the situation
in which I find myself:

00:00:57.969 --> 00:01:01.013
I'm a professional investor
about half the day,

00:01:02.052 --> 00:01:03.560
the daylight half.

00:01:03.584 --> 00:01:05.355
I was paying close attention earlier,

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:08.039
and I now know I need to have
10 hours sleep at night,

00:01:08.063 --> 00:01:10.687
which is tricky, because last
night the show ended

00:01:10.711 --> 00:01:13.718
about 12:30, and so I was, I got --

00:01:13.742 --> 00:01:16.646
and that was in Santa Rosa,
so I got home a little late.

00:01:17.175 --> 00:01:20.319
I want you to understand,
I've been studying the technology world,

00:01:20.343 --> 00:01:22.879
and things have already begun to change.

00:01:22.903 --> 00:01:24.353
But they're changing in ways

00:01:24.377 --> 00:01:27.303
that I see literally no
commentator referring to today.

00:01:28.091 --> 00:01:30.798
There are six things going on
that I'm going to focus on.

00:01:30.822 --> 00:01:33.691
I want you to understand,
each one of these is a hypothesis;

00:01:33.715 --> 00:01:35.568
it is subject to revision.

00:01:35.592 --> 00:01:37.953
It may even be subject to elimination.

00:01:37.977 --> 00:01:39.328
But I want you to understand

00:01:39.352 --> 00:01:42.769
I've been working with this group
of hypotheses now for about 10 months,

00:01:42.793 --> 00:01:45.953
and what's really interesting
is that I've been exposing them

00:01:45.977 --> 00:01:47.893
to a lot of people in the industry,

00:01:47.917 --> 00:01:50.632
and people have been finding it
very hard to debunk them.

00:01:50.656 --> 00:01:52.678
So I'm going to share them with you today,

00:01:52.702 --> 00:01:55.924
because I think collectively, we have
a chance of figuring this out.

00:01:55.948 --> 00:01:58.657
The first thing -- and I think
this is fairly obvious --

00:01:58.681 --> 00:02:00.579
is: Windows is dying.

00:02:00.603 --> 00:02:01.768
And --

00:02:01.792 --> 00:02:03.701
(Applause)

00:02:04.326 --> 00:02:06.150
I mean no disrespect to Microsoft,

00:02:06.174 --> 00:02:09.899
because I think, in fact, Microsoft
as a company has many things it can do

00:02:09.923 --> 00:02:11.266
to maintain growth,

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:14.006
but desktops would not be one of them.

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:17.192
And the key indicator here,
and the only one you need to know

00:02:17.216 --> 00:02:19.091
to understand what's going on here,

00:02:20.567 --> 00:02:25.129
is that smartphones have
basically taken Windows

00:02:25.153 --> 00:02:29.000
from 96% of internet-connected
devices 3 or 4 years ago,

00:02:30.038 --> 00:02:31.548
to under 50% now.

00:02:32.097 --> 00:02:33.737
And it is falling precipitously;

00:02:33.761 --> 00:02:37.434
they'll be under 30 percent,
probably about a year and a half from now.

00:02:38.468 --> 00:02:40.442
Microsoft has lots of things it can do.

00:02:40.466 --> 00:02:43.296
It can retreat to Exchange
and crank the price there.

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:45.741
But the reason this is so significant

00:02:45.765 --> 00:02:49.675
is that Windows and Enterprise
software, which is related to it --

00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:51.861
think SAP and people like that --

00:02:51.885 --> 00:02:56.406
those businesses account for hundreds
of billions of dollars in revenue.

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:59.714
And I'm suggesting we're going to have
a jump ball for that revenue.

00:02:59.738 --> 00:03:03.466
And in a world where the US economy
is not growing that rapidly,

00:03:04.532 --> 00:03:09.931
having somebody go away is the simplest
way to create room for new industries.

00:03:09.955 --> 00:03:12.548
And this is where the revenues
are going to come from.

00:03:12.572 --> 00:03:16.393
But guess what? Like a Ginsu
knife commercial, there's more!

00:03:16.417 --> 00:03:17.696
(Laughter)

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:21.104
It turns out Microsoft
is not the only company

00:03:21.128 --> 00:03:24.143
whose body is lying
across the railroad tracks today.

00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:27.490
Another one is Google.

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:31.054
Now, you may not have focused on this,

00:03:31.078 --> 00:03:35.378
but index search accounted for
90% of all search volume

00:03:35.402 --> 00:03:36.599
about 4 years ago.

00:03:38.234 --> 00:03:39.884
But an interesting thing happened.

00:03:39.908 --> 00:03:45.906
Google got to be so successful
that the index became full of garbage.

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:49.519
In fact, the entire Web
has become full of garbage.

00:03:50.106 --> 00:03:53.591
If you think about it, the Web has become
almost a digital Detroit.

00:03:53.615 --> 00:03:54.682
(Laughter)

00:03:54.706 --> 00:03:56.114
If you look hard enough,

00:03:56.138 --> 00:03:58.942
you can find really
compelling things there.

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:03.605
But if you aren't really careful,
you can get mugged.

00:04:03.629 --> 00:04:05.265
(Laughter)

00:04:05.289 --> 00:04:06.720
And it is no shock

00:04:06.744 --> 00:04:09.399
that each one of us
and everyone else out there

00:04:09.423 --> 00:04:13.020
have looked for other ways to find
the things we want to find.

00:04:13.044 --> 00:04:14.855
We started with Wikipedia,

00:04:14.879 --> 00:04:18.410
but then Facebook came along
for matters of taste and money;

00:04:18.434 --> 00:04:20.372
Twitter came along for real-time news;

00:04:20.396 --> 00:04:22.368
LinkedIn, for professional things;

00:04:22.392 --> 00:04:25.005
Match.com, for less professional things;

00:04:25.029 --> 00:04:27.848
TripAdvisor for travel,
Yelp for restaurants,

00:04:27.872 --> 00:04:32.018
Realtor.com for finding a home,
Dictionary.com for words,

00:04:32.042 --> 00:04:34.148
Wordnik for the whole language.

00:04:34.172 --> 00:04:36.320
So the thing has really changed.

00:04:36.344 --> 00:04:37.797
And here's what's interesting:

00:04:37.821 --> 00:04:40.854
like Microsoft, Google has
plenty of ways to respond

00:04:40.878 --> 00:04:42.505
in terms of growing its business.

00:04:42.529 --> 00:04:46.111
But what it cannot do
is recover its position

00:04:46.135 --> 00:04:48.119
as the dominant player on the internet.

00:04:48.746 --> 00:04:52.748
It is my belief that when
Google came along in 1998,

00:04:52.772 --> 00:04:55.503
the internet was an open-source,

00:04:55.527 --> 00:04:58.481
long-tail world with no leader.

00:04:58.505 --> 00:05:01.499
And Google stepped into this void,
provided leadership

00:05:01.523 --> 00:05:02.984
and implemented a strategy

00:05:03.008 --> 00:05:07.104
that systematically commoditized
all forms of content.

00:05:07.628 --> 00:05:11.052
And the simplest way to look at it
is to look at a Google results page:

00:05:11.076 --> 00:05:14.461
the only logo on that page is Google's;

00:05:14.485 --> 00:05:16.371
everything else is in the same font.

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:20.499
That form of commoditization
has been tremendous for Google

00:05:20.523 --> 00:05:22.807
and horrible for almost everyone else.

00:05:22.831 --> 00:05:26.132
And I believe, to a first
order, it is over --

00:05:26.156 --> 00:05:30.593
not because index search is going away,
but because, like word processing,

00:05:30.617 --> 00:05:33.340
it's gone from the most important
application we all had,

00:05:33.364 --> 00:05:35.352
to just another thing we do.

00:05:35.831 --> 00:05:38.176
And you see this in mobile in particular.

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:42.958
Because in mobile, people have found
other ways to find what they want.

00:05:42.982 --> 00:05:45.987
Index search is too disruptive
on a cell phone,

00:05:46.011 --> 00:05:49.967
so the rate of index search
is a small fraction on cell phones

00:05:49.991 --> 00:05:51.511
to what it is on desktops.

00:05:51.535 --> 00:05:56.266
And that is the leading indicator
that Google's recovery, if you will,

00:05:56.290 --> 00:05:58.637
will be in something other than search.

00:05:59.319 --> 00:06:04.295
The third hypothesis I have
is no longer controversial,

00:06:04.319 --> 00:06:06.536
but it's important
to understand what happened.

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:10.295
If the left-hand side of this equation
is the open-source World Wide Web,

00:06:10.319 --> 00:06:12.018
with its belief in the long tail,

00:06:12.042 --> 00:06:14.485
its belief in an absence of regulation,

00:06:14.509 --> 00:06:16.857
of an absence of security and control,

00:06:16.881 --> 00:06:18.959
it's really a frontier.

00:06:18.983 --> 00:06:21.117
Apple came along with a different vision.

00:06:21.141 --> 00:06:23.225
They said, "We think the Web is dead.

00:06:23.249 --> 00:06:24.932
We're going to go on the internet,

00:06:24.956 --> 00:06:26.607
because that's the big data store,

00:06:26.631 --> 00:06:31.957
and we're going to provide you
with branded, thoughtful, value-added,

00:06:31.981 --> 00:06:34.821
copyright-protected content."

00:06:35.502 --> 00:06:38.728
And people have overwhelmingly chosen that

00:06:38.752 --> 00:06:40.123
over Google's vision.

00:06:40.147 --> 00:06:41.628
Over the last three years,

00:06:41.652 --> 00:06:45.692
Apple's gone from being
an also-ran in computers

00:06:45.716 --> 00:06:51.826
to this year they will ship approximately
100 million internet-enabled devices.

00:06:52.693 --> 00:06:54.270
One hundred million.

00:06:54.294 --> 00:06:56.222
They'll probably be just short of that.

00:06:57.054 --> 00:06:59.518
The point here is, it's Apple's world.

00:07:01.849 --> 00:07:03.246
We're lucky to be part of it,

00:07:03.270 --> 00:07:05.991
because Steve is quite intolerant
about who he lets in.

00:07:06.015 --> 00:07:07.028
(Laughter)

00:07:07.052 --> 00:07:11.110
But think about this:
imagine Georgia in the Civil War. OK?

00:07:11.134 --> 00:07:12.928
Apple is Sherman,

00:07:12.952 --> 00:07:14.480
World Wide Web is Joe Johnston.

00:07:14.504 --> 00:07:16.421
And the point is, they've lost.

00:07:16.889 --> 00:07:18.831
So the Web is looking at this and going,

00:07:18.855 --> 00:07:20.450
"My God, we've got to come back."

00:07:20.474 --> 00:07:24.615
And the cost in order to do this is
they have to sacrifice Google.

00:07:25.253 --> 00:07:28.108
So Google has pushed
the pendulum of technology

00:07:28.132 --> 00:07:30.652
to the absolute limit of commoditization,

00:07:31.310 --> 00:07:34.085
to the point where people
who spent their whole lives

00:07:34.109 --> 00:07:37.606
developing really valuable,
compelling entertainment

00:07:37.630 --> 00:07:39.664
and really valuable, compelling journalism

00:07:39.688 --> 00:07:41.561
and really valuable, compelling novels,

00:07:41.585 --> 00:07:43.631
can't make money doing it anymore.

00:07:43.655 --> 00:07:48.391
So the Web said, "OK,
if Google's over here, and Apple's here,

00:07:48.415 --> 00:07:52.062
HTML 5, the next generation, is going
to be on the other side of Apple."

00:07:52.086 --> 00:07:55.704
So the new battle, instead of being
commoditization versus the App Store,

00:07:55.728 --> 00:08:00.085
is going to be between the App Store
and highly differentiated content.

00:08:00.109 --> 00:08:03.712
If you don't know what HTML 5 is,
let me help you understand.

00:08:03.736 --> 00:08:05.389
It is a programming language.

00:08:05.950 --> 00:08:08.025
But it's a profound one.

00:08:08.049 --> 00:08:09.945
Because for the first time,

00:08:09.969 --> 00:08:12.821
you're going to be able
to construct a web page

00:08:12.845 --> 00:08:16.535
where the entire thing can have
embedded interactivity,

00:08:16.559 --> 00:08:19.856
can have video, audio,
whatever it is that you want.

00:08:19.880 --> 00:08:21.840
But no more Flash boxes.

00:08:22.486 --> 00:08:24.145
And it's a huge, huge change,

00:08:24.169 --> 00:08:26.832
because it essentially
opens up a new canvas.

00:08:26.856 --> 00:08:29.873
And it doesn't just open it
up for The New York Times,

00:08:29.897 --> 00:08:32.341
it opens it up for everybody on WordPress,

00:08:32.365 --> 00:08:34.163
it opens it up for every band ...

00:08:34.855 --> 00:08:39.588
Because suddenly, the ability to produce
a differentiated, highly compelling,

00:08:39.612 --> 00:08:42.946
value-added -- maybe
even monetizable -- product

00:08:42.970 --> 00:08:44.336
will be there.

00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:47.628
And what's really interesting
is, thanks to Apple,

00:08:47.652 --> 00:08:50.627
there's nothing that commoditizers
can do about you.

00:08:51.609 --> 00:08:54.655
Apple may try to stop us,
but I don't think they will.

00:08:54.679 --> 00:08:56.517
I think they're smarter than that.

00:08:56.903 --> 00:08:59.797
So the key point is, I don't know
where we're going to stop

00:08:59.821 --> 00:09:01.519
as the pendulum swings back.

00:09:01.543 --> 00:09:05.092
But I think the days
of hypercommoditization are behind us.

00:09:05.517 --> 00:09:07.001
And we can all play in this.

00:09:07.025 --> 00:09:10.331
In a moment I'm going to tell you
how I'm doing it personally.

00:09:10.355 --> 00:09:11.522
Tablets.

00:09:12.187 --> 00:09:14.842
This is the other side
of why Windows is dead.

00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:17.984
If any of you does not own an iPad --

00:09:18.008 --> 00:09:21.449
Look, I don't own any Apple stock,
so I have no axe in this,

00:09:21.473 --> 00:09:26.095
but seriously, if you don't own an iPad,
you cannot possibly understand

00:09:26.119 --> 00:09:28.071
the most important things going on now.

00:09:28.095 --> 00:09:29.151
(Laughter)

00:09:29.175 --> 00:09:30.830
No, I'm really serious about this.

00:09:30.854 --> 00:09:34.832
And I think the most important point
is that the other players on this thing,

00:09:34.856 --> 00:09:36.390
at the moment,

00:09:36.414 --> 00:09:37.675
have made no impact.

00:09:38.166 --> 00:09:39.614
And keep in mind,

00:09:39.638 --> 00:09:44.277
it was our investment that built
Palm's webOS that HP's shipping

00:09:44.301 --> 00:09:46.025
soon, eventually, someday.

00:09:46.049 --> 00:09:47.799
(Laughter)

00:09:48.119 --> 00:09:50.617
I think it's highly probable
Apple wins this thing

00:09:50.641 --> 00:09:53.909
with market share closer
to what they have on the iPod

00:09:53.933 --> 00:09:55.893
than to what they have on the iPhone.

00:09:56.930 --> 00:09:58.824
That would be 70 or 80%.

00:09:58.848 --> 00:10:02.488
If that's right, Apple's going to be
50 to 100 billion dollars bigger

00:10:02.512 --> 00:10:03.669
in a few years

00:10:03.693 --> 00:10:04.844
than they are today.

00:10:05.318 --> 00:10:08.380
And I literally don't see anybody
else even challenging them.

00:10:09.013 --> 00:10:10.709
It's really important to understand

00:10:10.733 --> 00:10:14.103
that Apple's cost structure is so
favorable relative to everybody else,

00:10:14.127 --> 00:10:17.020
it's almost impossible to imagine
any of the cell phone guys,

00:10:17.044 --> 00:10:18.976
particularly Android guys, catching up.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:23.079
Because Apple's gross margins
exceed the retail price

00:10:23.103 --> 00:10:24.836
of almost every Android phone.

00:10:26.561 --> 00:10:29.037
Here is the one that I want
to leave you with

00:10:29.061 --> 00:10:31.200
as an investment idea, first and foremost.

00:10:31.224 --> 00:10:33.482
The mania on Wall Street is about social.

00:10:33.506 --> 00:10:36.921
Social is a sideshow.

00:10:36.945 --> 00:10:40.821
And I say this as somebody whose fund
has most of its money in Facebook.

00:10:41.671 --> 00:10:43.335
It is a one-off.

00:10:43.359 --> 00:10:44.874
This is not ...

00:10:45.731 --> 00:10:48.404
To borrow a phrase from Star Wars:

00:10:48.428 --> 00:10:50.899
this is not the mania
you are looking for.

00:10:51.969 --> 00:10:55.327
The one we're talking about will be
so much bigger than this.

00:10:55.351 --> 00:10:56.752
Facebook has won.

00:10:56.776 --> 00:10:59.407
It is the new Windows. OK?

00:10:59.431 --> 00:11:03.795
A few other guys -- Twitter,
Yelp, Skype, LinkedIn --

00:11:03.819 --> 00:11:07.455
are building successful platforms

00:11:07.479 --> 00:11:10.695
that are much smaller
than what Facebook has.

00:11:11.503 --> 00:11:12.758
And they'll be successful.

00:11:12.782 --> 00:11:16.370
But everybody else coming along is going
to have to follow the Zynga model.

00:11:16.394 --> 00:11:20.450
They're going to have to make themselves
subordinate to the platform of Facebook.

00:11:20.474 --> 00:11:23.995
And Zynga's inability to build
anything successful off of Facebook,

00:11:24.019 --> 00:11:28.783
I think, is the key indicator
of why this platform is so powerful.

00:11:28.807 --> 00:11:31.166
So if you do a start-up today
in the social world,

00:11:31.190 --> 00:11:32.527
build it on top of Facebook.

00:11:32.551 --> 00:11:34.664
It's the only piece of advice
I can give you.

00:11:34.688 --> 00:11:37.373
But the most important piece
of advice is: forget social.

00:11:37.397 --> 00:11:39.566
Social is now a feature,
it's not a platform.

00:11:39.590 --> 00:11:40.914
So embed social,

00:11:40.938 --> 00:11:44.473
the same way that Catherine said,
"Embed gamification into everything."

00:11:45.138 --> 00:11:46.686
It's all about engagement.

00:11:48.478 --> 00:11:51.862
The future is going to be different.

00:11:52.640 --> 00:11:54.021
And the core question is:

00:11:54.045 --> 00:11:56.022
What are we all going to do about it?

00:11:56.459 --> 00:12:00.235
What I do is very simple:
I believe in full-contact investing.

00:12:00.757 --> 00:12:04.150
So I looked at HTML 5
about a year ago, and I said,

00:12:04.174 --> 00:12:07.013
"This thing could be really important.
How do I find out?"

00:12:07.037 --> 00:12:08.617
So my band, Moonalice,

00:12:08.641 --> 00:12:11.547
which, a couple years ago,
did an album with T Bone Burnett,

00:12:11.571 --> 00:12:15.002
that we thought was going to be
a huge hit and blah, blah, blah ...

00:12:15.026 --> 00:12:19.545
Well, we learned that nobody cared about
hippie music done by old folks, so --

00:12:19.569 --> 00:12:20.632
(Laughter)

00:12:20.656 --> 00:12:23.557
So we put it all onto the net,
went on Facebook and Twitter.

00:12:23.581 --> 00:12:25.772
We started doing things
called "Twittercasts,"

00:12:25.796 --> 00:12:28.432
the first live concerts
and then prerecorded concerts,

00:12:28.456 --> 00:12:29.667
distributed over Twitter.

00:12:29.691 --> 00:12:33.134
Then we started using live stream,
the same thing we're using here today,

00:12:33.158 --> 00:12:35.262
to do internet-based
live video of our shows.

00:12:35.286 --> 00:12:38.147
And then recently, we bought
a satellite network.

00:12:38.171 --> 00:12:42.425
Why? 'Cause it cost less than three months
of what our manager used to cost.

00:12:42.449 --> 00:12:43.472
(Laughter)

00:12:43.496 --> 00:12:46.577
And right now, we broadcast
every one of our shows --

00:12:46.601 --> 00:12:47.958
other than the U2 show --

00:12:47.982 --> 00:12:50.642
live, in HTML 5,

00:12:50.666 --> 00:12:52.220
via satellite,

00:12:52.244 --> 00:12:54.348
in a system we totally control.

00:12:55.640 --> 00:13:00.174
We have an app that's about to ship
within the next month.

00:13:00.198 --> 00:13:03.953
It's -- "app" is the wrong term;
our website is being upgraded to HTML 5.

00:13:03.977 --> 00:13:07.599
And in it, you will be able,
from any phone, anywhere,

00:13:07.623 --> 00:13:10.126
to play any song we've ever played live

00:13:10.150 --> 00:13:11.937
and view any live video that we have,

00:13:11.961 --> 00:13:13.900
which is 150, 200 shows.

00:13:14.935 --> 00:13:18.387
Now, it cost practically
nothing to do this.

00:13:18.768 --> 00:13:21.046
And we're this teeny-weeny little band.

00:13:22.073 --> 00:13:24.871
Now, I know more about technology
than most people,

00:13:24.895 --> 00:13:28.511
but that's just because I know
more than most people who are 55.

00:13:28.535 --> 00:13:31.759
But people who are 18 to 20,
who live in this world,

00:13:31.783 --> 00:13:33.814
are going to be able
to use these platforms

00:13:33.838 --> 00:13:35.405
in music and everywhere else

00:13:35.429 --> 00:13:37.019
in a fundamentally different way.

00:13:38.319 --> 00:13:39.997
I think creativity is coming back.

00:13:40.021 --> 00:13:42.308
Moonalice is something
that's built around that.

00:13:42.332 --> 00:13:44.743
We have poster artists
for every single show.

00:13:45.187 --> 00:13:48.440
We have photographers who work
every show, we have painters.

00:13:48.464 --> 00:13:52.646
And the notion is, I believe
that creativity has been stifled,

00:13:52.670 --> 00:13:54.537
not so much by technology,

00:13:54.561 --> 00:13:59.725
but by the general deterioration
of American culture --

00:13:59.749 --> 00:14:02.099
you know, people's unwillingness
to be educated,

00:14:02.123 --> 00:14:07.728
this notion that we have to fall back
on ritual and beliefs, instead of facts.

00:14:08.338 --> 00:14:11.369
But I think technology is finally
going to do us a favor.

00:14:12.346 --> 00:14:16.913
I think it's finally going to give us
the tools to make us independent.

00:14:16.937 --> 00:14:18.645
And there's little glimmers, right?

00:14:18.669 --> 00:14:20.386
We see the Arab Spring

00:14:20.410 --> 00:14:22.768
and the impact that Twitter
and Facebook had.

00:14:24.164 --> 00:14:25.812
Pretty exciting.

00:14:25.836 --> 00:14:27.568
But imagine a world

00:14:28.505 --> 00:14:32.635
in which everything is an app.

00:14:32.659 --> 00:14:36.537
In HTML 5, digital Detroit
gets replaced by this thing

00:14:36.561 --> 00:14:38.958
where every tweet is an app,

00:14:38.982 --> 00:14:42.185
every advertisement
is an instance of a store.

00:14:42.801 --> 00:14:44.495
Think about what that means.

00:14:44.519 --> 00:14:46.603
So instead of seeing an Amazon display ad,

00:14:46.627 --> 00:14:50.235
you see the store, say,
on the New York Times Book Review.

00:14:50.944 --> 00:14:55.024
You can both create demand
and satisfy it in the same place.

00:14:55.395 --> 00:14:56.671
Why?

00:14:56.695 --> 00:14:58.425
Because that's better for everybody.

00:14:58.449 --> 00:15:01.411
Saves time, increases engagement,

00:15:01.435 --> 00:15:03.433
because it keeps you on the page.

00:15:03.457 --> 00:15:06.819
We're going from a web of elevators,

00:15:06.843 --> 00:15:11.075
where you go to different places,
and you go off sites and you lose people,

00:15:11.099 --> 00:15:12.678
to a control panel model.

00:15:13.402 --> 00:15:15.112
And guess who's going to make it?

00:15:15.841 --> 00:15:17.088
You are.

00:15:17.112 --> 00:15:18.294
Thank you very much.

00:15:18.318 --> 00:15:20.655
(Applause)
