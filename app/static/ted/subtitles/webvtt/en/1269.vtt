WEBVTT

00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:02.936
I started Improv Everywhere
about 10 years ago

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:06.456
when I moved to New York City
with an interest in acting and comedy.

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:09.456
Because I was new to the city,
I didn't have access to a stage,

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:12.856
so I decided to create
my own in public places.

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:15.256
So the first project
we're going to take a look at

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:17.176
is the very first No Pants Subway Ride.

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:19.176
Now, this took place in January of 2002.

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:21.136
And this woman is the star of the video.

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:22.896
She doesn't know she's being filmed.

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:24.856
She's being filmed with a hidden camera.

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:26.816
This is on the 6 train in New York City.

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:28.936
And this is the first stop along the line.

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:30.216
These are two Danish guys

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.640
who come in and sit down
next to the hidden camera.

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:35.896
And that's me right there in a brown coat.

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:37.576
It's about 30 degrees outside.

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:40.136
I'm wearing a hat. I'm wearing a scarf.

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:42.280
And the girl's going
to notice me right here.

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:50.256
(Laughter)

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.496
And as you'll see now,
I'm not wearing pants.

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:56.616
(Laughter)

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.576
At this point --

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:00.096
at this point she's noticed me,

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.736
but in New York there's weirdos
on any given train car.

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.215
One person's not that unusual.

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:07.656
She goes back to reading her book,
which is unfortunately titled "Rape."

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.016
(Laughter)

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.576
So she's noticed the unusual thing,
but she's gone back to her normal life.

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:16.536
Now, in the meantime, I have six friends

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.896
who are waiting
at the next six consecutive stops

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:20.576
in their underwear as well.

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:22.936
They're going to be entering
this car one by one.

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:25.456
We'll act as though
we don't know each other.

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:28.496
And we'll act as if it's just
an unfortunate mistake we've made,

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:30.696
forgetting our pants
on this cold January day.

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.240
(Laughter)

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:48.200
(Laughter continues)

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:58.536
So at this point,

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.896
she decides to put the rape book away.

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:02.976
(Laughter)

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.336
And she decides to be a little bit
more aware of her surroundings.

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:09.336
In the meantime, the two Danish guys
to the left of the camera,

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:10.576
they're cracking up.

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:13.576
They think this is the funniest thing
they've ever seen before.

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:16.280
And watch her make eye contact
with them right about now.

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:23.256
(Laughter)

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:25.096
And I love that moment in this video,

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:27.696
because before it became
a shared experience,

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:30.496
it was something
that was maybe a little bit scary,

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:32.776
or something that was
at least confusing to her.

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:34.896
And then, once it became
a shared experience,

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.336
it was funny and something
that she could laugh at.

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:40.960
So the train is now pulling
into the third stop along the 6 line.

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:58.176
(Laughter)

00:02:58.200 --> 00:02:59.896
So the video won't show everything.

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:02.016
This goes on for another four stops.

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:05.296
A total of seven guys
enter anonymously in their underwear.

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:08.056
At the eighth stop,
a girl came in with a giant duffel bag

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:10.536
and announced she had
pants for sale for a dollar --

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:13.776
like you might sell batteries
or candy on the train.

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:16.856
We all very matter-of-factly
bought a pair of pants, put them on

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:19.616
and said, "Thank you.
That's exactly what I needed today,"

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:22.816
and then exited without
revealing what had happened

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:24.656
and went in all different directions.

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:27.656
(Applause)

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:28.880
Thank you.

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:32.416
So that's a still from the video there.

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:34.416
And I love that girl's reaction so much.

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:36.440
And watching that videotape later that day

00:03:36.464 --> 00:03:38.776
inspired me to keep doing what I do.

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:41.336
And really one of the points
of Improv Everywhere

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:43.376
is to cause a scene in a public place

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:45.616
that is a positive experience
for other people.

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:49.096
It's a prank, but it's a prank
that gives somebody a great story to tell.

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:50.496
And her reaction inspired me

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:52.536
to do a second annual
No Pants Subway Ride.

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:54.465
And we've continued to do it every year.

00:03:54.489 --> 00:03:57.176
This January, we did
the 10th annual No Pants Subway Ride

00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:59.536
where a diverse group of 3,500 people

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:01.816
rode the train in their
underwear in New York --

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:03.896
almost every single
train line in the city.

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:06.296
And also in 50 other cities
around the world,

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:07.536
people participated.

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:09.696
(Laughter)

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:13.136
As I started taking improv class
at the Upright Citizens Brigade Theater

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:16.416
and meeting other creative people
and other performers and comedians,

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:18.495
I started amassing
a mailing list of people

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:20.495
who wanted to do these types of projects.

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:22.456
So I could do more large-scale projects.

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:24.816
Well, one day I was walking
through Union Square,

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:28.376
and I saw this building,
which had just been built in 2005.

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:31.216
There was a girl in one of the windows
and she was dancing.

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:33.416
It was very peculiar,
because it was dark out,

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:35.656
but she was backlit
with florescent lighting.

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:36.936
She was very much onstage

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:39.176
and I couldn't figure out
why she was doing it.

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:41.376
After about 15 seconds,
her friend appeared --

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:43.216
she had been hiding behind a display.

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:45.376
They laughed, hugged
each other and ran away.

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:47.136
Maybe she had been dared to do this.

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:48.456
So I got inspired by that.

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:51.416
Looking at the entire facade --
there were 70 total windows --

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:52.816
and I knew what I had to do.

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:54.376
(Laughter)

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:56.296
So this project is called Look Up More.

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:57.896
We had 70 actors dress in black.

00:04:57.920 --> 00:04:59.536
This was completely unauthorized.

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:01.696
We didn't let the stores know
we were coming.

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:03.616
And I stood in the park giving signals.

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:07.136
The first signal was for everybody
to hold up these four-foot tall letters

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:08.736
that spelled out "Look Up More,"

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:10.000
the name of the project.

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:14.280
The second signal was for everybody
to do jumping jacks together.

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:17.016
You'll see that start right here.

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:19.496
(Laughter)

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:21.736
And then we had dancing.
We had everyone dance.

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:23.096
And then we had dance solos

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:26.336
where only one person would dance
and everybody would point to them.

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:33.096
(Laughter)

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:34.736
So then I gave a new hand signal,

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:38.136
which signaled the next soloist
down below in Forever 21,

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:39.440
and he danced.

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:42.056
There were several other activities.

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:45.496
We had people jumping up and down,
people dropping to the ground.

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:47.976
And I was standing
just anonymously in a sweatshirt,

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.256
putting my hand on and off of a trashcan
to signal the advancement.

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:54.456
And because it was in Union Square Park,
right by a subway station,

00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:57.616
there were hundreds of people by the end
who stopped and looked up

00:05:57.640 --> 00:05:59.160
and watched what we were doing.

00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:03.176
There's a better photo of it.

00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:06.976
So that particular event
was inspired by a moment

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.336
that I happened to stumble upon.

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:10.856
The next project I want to show

00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:13.696
was given to me
in an email from a stranger.

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:16.056
A high school kid in Texas
wrote me in 2006

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:18.536
and said, "You should get
as many people as possible

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:21.136
to put on blue polo shirts and khaki pants

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:23.416
and go into a Best Buy and stand around."

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:25.856
(Laughter)

00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:28.136
(Applause)

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:32.656
So I wrote this high school kid
back immediately

00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:34.336
and I said, "Yes, you are correct.

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:36.856
I think I'll try to do that
this weekend. Thank you."

00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:38.256
So here's the video.

00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:39.776
So again, this is 2005.

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:42.296
This is the Best Buy in New York City.

00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:45.096
We had about 80 people
show up to participate,

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:46.416
entering one by one.

00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:48.917
There was an eight-year-old girl,
a 10-year-old girl.

00:06:48.941 --> 00:06:51.976
There was also a 65-year-old man
who participated.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:53.976
So a very diverse group of people.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:55.136
(Laughter)

00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:57.816
And I told people,
"Don't work. Don't actually do work.

00:06:57.840 --> 00:06:59.056
But also, don't shop.

00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:01.496
Just stand around
and don't face products."

00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:03.336
Now you can see the regular employees

00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:05.856
by the ones that have
the yellow tags on their shirt.

00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:07.616
Everybody else is one of our actors.

00:07:07.640 --> 00:07:09.496
(Laughter)

00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:11.976
The lower-level employees
thought it was very funny.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.976
Several of them went
to go get their camera from the break room

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:16.256
and took photos with us.

00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:19.336
A lot of them made jokes
about trying to get us to go to the back

00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:21.976
to get heavy television sets
for customers.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.936
The managers and the security guards,
on the other hand,

00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:27.256
did not find it particularly funny.

00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:28.896
You can see them in this footage.

00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:31.536
They're wearing either
a yellow shirt or a black shirt.

00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:33.376
And we were there probably 10 minutes

00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:35.896
before the managers decided to dial 911.

00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:38.176
(Laughter)

00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:39.976
So they started running around

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.576
telling everybody the cops were coming,
"Watch out, the cops are coming."

00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:46.216
And you can see the cops
in this footage right here.

00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:49.736
That's a cop wearing black right there,
being filmed with a hidden camera.

00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:52.416
Ultimately, the police
had to inform Best Buy management

00:07:52.440 --> 00:07:56.016
that it was not, in fact, illegal
to wear a blue polo shirt and khaki pants.

00:07:56.040 --> 00:07:58.336
(Laughter)

00:07:58.360 --> 00:08:01.856
(Applause)

00:08:01.880 --> 00:08:03.096
Thank you.

00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:04.816
(Applause)

00:08:04.840 --> 00:08:09.256
So we had been there for 20 minutes;
we were happy to exit the store.

00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:13.336
One thing the managers were trying to do
was to track down our cameras.

00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:16.856
And they caught a couple of my guys
who had hidden cameras in duffel bags.

00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:18.785
But the one camera guy they never caught

00:08:18.809 --> 00:08:21.016
was the guy that went in
just with a blank tape

00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:23.256
and went over to the Best Buy
camera department

00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:25.416
and just put his tape
in one of their cameras

00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:26.680
and pretended to shop.

00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:30.656
So I like that concept of using
their own technology against them.

00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:32.376
(Laughter)

00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:35.096
I think our best projects
are ones that are site-specific

00:08:35.120 --> 00:08:37.296
and happen at a particular
place for a reason.

00:08:37.320 --> 00:08:39.273
And one morning, I was riding the subway.

00:08:39.297 --> 00:08:41.416
I had to make a transfer
at the 53rd St. stop

00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:43.456
where there are
these two giant escalators.

00:08:43.480 --> 00:08:46.936
And it's a very depressing place
to be in the morning, it's very crowded.

00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:48.856
So I decided to try and stage something

00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:51.520
that could make it as happy
as possible for one morning.

00:08:52.400 --> 00:08:55.896
So this was in the winter of 2009 --
8:30 in the morning.

00:08:55.920 --> 00:08:57.456
It's morning rush hour.

00:08:57.480 --> 00:08:59.216
It's very cold outside.

00:08:59.240 --> 00:09:00.856
People are coming in from Queens,

00:09:00.880 --> 00:09:03.776
transferring from the E train
to the 6 train.

00:09:03.800 --> 00:09:06.896
And they're going up
these giant escalators

00:09:06.920 --> 00:09:08.458
on their way to their jobs.

00:09:10.840 --> 00:09:11.990
[Rob wants]

00:09:16.235 --> 00:09:17.647
[to give you]

00:09:20.175 --> 00:09:21.325
(Laughter)

00:09:21.349 --> 00:09:22.602
[a high five!]

00:09:22.626 --> 00:09:25.070
(Laughter)

00:09:25.094 --> 00:09:26.343
[Get ready!]

00:09:26.367 --> 00:09:33.336
(Laughter)

00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:39.976
(Applause)

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:41.216
Thank you.

00:09:41.240 --> 00:09:44.256
So there's a photograph
that illustrates it a little bit better.

00:09:44.280 --> 00:09:46.936
He gave 2,000 high fives that day,

00:09:46.960 --> 00:09:49.336
and he washed his hands
before and afterward

00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:50.776
and did not get sick.

00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:52.800
And that was done also without permission,

00:09:52.824 --> 00:09:54.936
although no one seemed to care.

00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:56.256
So I'd say over the years,

00:09:56.280 --> 00:09:59.496
one of the most common criticisms
I see of Improv Everywhere

00:09:59.520 --> 00:10:01.416
left anonymously on YouTube comments

00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:04.576
is: "These people
have too much time on their hands."

00:10:04.600 --> 00:10:07.536
And you know, not everybody's
going to like everything you do,

00:10:07.560 --> 00:10:10.856
and I've certainly developed a thick skin
thanks to Internet comments,

00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:12.536
but that one's always bothered me,

00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:14.896
because we don't have
too much time on our hands.

00:10:14.920 --> 00:10:17.016
The participants
in Improv Everywhere events

00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:19.696
have just as much leisure time
as any other New Yorkers,

00:10:19.720 --> 00:10:22.616
they just occasionally choose
to spend it in an unusual way.

00:10:22.640 --> 00:10:24.376
You know, every Saturday and Sunday,

00:10:24.400 --> 00:10:26.456
hundreds of thousands of people each fall

00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:29.176
gather in football stadiums
to watch games.

00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:32.256
And I've never seen anybody comment,
looking at a football game,

00:10:32.280 --> 00:10:35.736
"All those people in the stands,
they have too much time on their hands."

00:10:35.760 --> 00:10:37.016
And of course they don't.

00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:39.896
It's a perfectly wonderful way
to spent a weekend afternoon,

00:10:39.920 --> 00:10:41.776
watching a football game in a stadium.

00:10:41.800 --> 00:10:43.976
But I think it's also
a perfectly valid way

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:47.176
to spend an afternoon
freezing in place with 200 people

00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:48.856
in the Grand Central terminal

00:10:48.880 --> 00:10:51.176
or dressing up like a ghostbuster

00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:53.456
and running through
the New York Public Library.

00:10:53.480 --> 00:10:55.576
(Laughter)

00:10:55.600 --> 00:10:58.816
Or listening to the same MP3
as 3,000 other people

00:10:58.840 --> 00:11:00.976
and dancing silently in a park,

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:03.176
or bursting into song in a grocery store

00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:05.416
as part of a spontaneous musical,

00:11:05.440 --> 00:11:08.856
or diving into the ocean in Coney Island
wearing formal attire.

00:11:08.880 --> 00:11:10.296
(Laughter)

00:11:10.320 --> 00:11:12.256
You know, as kids, we're taught to play.

00:11:12.280 --> 00:11:14.656
And we're never given a reason
why we should play.

00:11:14.680 --> 00:11:16.896
It's just acceptable
that play is a good thing.

00:11:16.920 --> 00:11:19.656
And I think that's sort of
the point of Improv Everywhere.

00:11:19.680 --> 00:11:22.976
It's that there is no point
and that there doesn't have to be a point.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.016
We don't need a reason.
As long as it's fun

00:11:25.040 --> 00:11:27.256
and it seems like
it's going to be a funny idea

00:11:27.280 --> 00:11:29.576
and it seems like the people
who witness it

00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:31.056
will also have a fun time,

00:11:31.080 --> 00:11:32.456
then that's enough for us.

00:11:32.480 --> 00:11:34.496
And I think, as adults, we need to learn

00:11:34.520 --> 00:11:36.976
that there's no right
or wrong way to play.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:38.216
Thank you very much.

00:11:38.240 --> 00:11:42.079
(Applause)
