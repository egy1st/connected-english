WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.714
I was offered a position
as associate professor of medicine

00:00:03.738 --> 00:00:06.546
and chief of scientific visualization

00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:08.547
at Yale University

00:00:08.571 --> 00:00:10.180
in the department of medicine.

00:00:10.204 --> 00:00:12.976
And my job was to write
many of the algorithms and code

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:14.976
for NASA to do virtual surgery

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.976
in preparation for the astronauts
going into deep-space flight,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.976
so they could be kept in robotic pods.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.906
One of the fascinating things
about what we were working on

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:25.948
is that we were seeing,
using new scanning technologies,

00:00:25.972 --> 00:00:27.953
things that had never been seen before.

00:00:27.977 --> 00:00:29.551
Not only in disease management,

00:00:29.575 --> 00:00:32.976
but also things that allowed us
to see things about the body

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.976
that just made you marvel.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.976
I remember one of the first times
we were looking at collagen.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.976
And your entire body, everything --

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:42.976
your hair, skin, bone, nails --

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.976
everything is made of collagen.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.928
And it's a kind of rope-like structure
that twirls and swirls like this.

00:00:49.952 --> 00:00:54.157
And the only place that collagen
changes its structure

00:00:54.181 --> 00:00:55.957
is in the cornea of your eye.

00:00:55.981 --> 00:00:59.356
In your eye,
it becomes a grid formation,

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:02.687
and therefore, it becomes
transparent, as opposed to opaque.

00:01:02.711 --> 00:01:04.976
So perfectly organized a structure,

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.514
it was hard not to attribute
divinity to it.

00:01:07.538 --> 00:01:12.636
Because we kept on seeing this
in different parts of the body.

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:14.976
One of the opportunities I had

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.381
was one person was working
on a really interesting

00:01:17.405 --> 00:01:19.976
micromagnetic resonance
imaging machine with the NIH.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.976
And what we were going to do

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.976
was scan a new project

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.830
on the development of the fetus
from conception to birth

00:01:26.854 --> 00:01:28.528
using these new technologies.

00:01:28.552 --> 00:01:30.509
So I wrote the algorithms and code,

00:01:30.533 --> 00:01:32.976
and he built the hardware --
Paul Lauterbur --

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.533
then went onto win the Nobel
Prize for inventing the MRI.

00:01:36.557 --> 00:01:37.976
I got the data.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.660
And I'm going to show you
a sample of the piece,

00:01:40.684 --> 00:01:41.976
"From Conception to Birth."

(Applause)

00:05:41.841 --> 00:05:44.241
Alexander Tsiaras: Thank you.

00:05:44.265 --> 00:05:45.542
But as you can see,

00:05:45.566 --> 00:05:47.743
when you actually start
working on this data,

00:05:47.767 --> 00:05:48.976
it's pretty spectacular.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.615
And as we kept on scanning more and more,

00:05:51.639 --> 00:05:53.834
working on this project,

00:05:53.858 --> 00:05:55.929
looking at these two simple cells

00:05:55.953 --> 00:05:59.976
that have this unbelievable machinery
that will become the magic of you.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:01.976
And as we kept on working on this data,

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.976
looking at small clusters of the body,

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.976
these little pieces of tissue

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.932
that were the trophoblasts
coming off of the blastocyst,

00:06:10.956 --> 00:06:13.918
all of a sudden burrowing itself
into the side of the uterus,

00:06:13.942 --> 00:06:15.276
saying, "I'm here to stay."

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:17.176
Having conversation and communications

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:19.076
with the estrogens, the progesterones,

00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:21.705
saying, "I'm here to stay, plant me,"

00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:25.066
building this incredible trilinear fetus

00:06:25.090 --> 00:06:28.176
that becomes, within 44 days,
something that you can recognize,

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:31.976
and then at nine weeks
is really kind of a little human being.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:33.976
The marvel of this information:

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.368
How do we actually have
this biological mechanism

00:06:37.392 --> 00:06:38.692
inside our body

00:06:38.716 --> 00:06:40.605
to actually see this information?

00:06:40.629 --> 00:06:42.916
I'm going to show you
something pretty unique.

00:06:42.940 --> 00:06:44.933
Here's a human heart at 25 days.

00:06:44.957 --> 00:06:46.550
It's just basically two strands.

00:06:46.574 --> 00:06:48.276
And like this magnificent origami,

00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:52.976
cells are developing at one million cells
per second at four weeks,

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:54.976
as it's just folding on itself.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.781
Within five weeks, you start to see
the early atrium and the early ventricles.

00:06:58.805 --> 00:07:01.025
Six weeks, these folds are now beginning

00:07:01.049 --> 00:07:03.206
with the papilla
on the inside of the heart

00:07:03.230 --> 00:07:06.676
actually being able to pull down
each one of those valves in your heart

00:07:06.700 --> 00:07:08.976
until you get a mature heart --

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.889
and then basically the development
of the entire human body.

00:07:11.913 --> 00:07:15.976
The magic of the mechanisms
inside each genetic structure

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.976
saying exactly where
that nerve cell should go --

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.006
the complexity of these,

00:07:21.030 --> 00:07:23.927
the mathematical models
of how these things are indeed done

00:07:23.951 --> 00:07:25.822
are beyond human comprehension.

00:07:25.846 --> 00:07:27.769
Even though I am a mathematician,

00:07:27.793 --> 00:07:29.708
I look at this with marvel

00:07:29.732 --> 00:07:33.976
of how do these instruction sets
not make these mistakes

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:35.976
as they build what is us?

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.000
It's a mystery, it's magic, it's divinity.

00:07:38.024 --> 00:07:40.976
Then you start to take
a look at adult life.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.239
Take a look at this
little tuft of capillaries.

00:07:43.263 --> 00:07:45.976
It's just a tiny
sub-substructure, microscopic.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:50.647
But basically by the time you're
nine months and you're given birth,

00:07:50.671 --> 00:07:54.976
you have almost 60,000 miles
of vessels inside your body.

00:07:55.317 --> 00:07:57.444
And only one mile is visible.

00:07:57.468 --> 00:07:59.976
59,999 miles

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.976
that are basically bringing
nutrients and taking waste away.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.661
The complexity of building
that within a single system

00:08:05.685 --> 00:08:09.570
is, again, beyond any comprehension
or any existing mathematics today.

00:08:09.594 --> 00:08:10.976
And then instructions set,

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.785
from the brain to every other
part of the body --

00:08:13.809 --> 00:08:15.663
look at the complexity of the folding.

00:08:15.687 --> 00:08:17.076
Where does this intelligence

00:08:17.100 --> 00:08:19.915
of knowing that a fold can
actually hold more information,

00:08:19.939 --> 00:08:22.531
so as you actually watch
the baby's brain grow.

00:08:22.555 --> 00:08:24.699
And this is one of the things we're doing.

00:08:24.723 --> 00:08:26.276
We're launching two new studies

00:08:26.300 --> 00:08:29.073
of scanning babies' brains
from the moment they're born.

00:08:29.097 --> 00:08:31.288
Every six months
until they're six years old,

00:08:31.312 --> 00:08:33.976
we're going to be doing
about 250 children,

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:37.703
watching exactly how the gyri
and the sulci of the brains fold

00:08:37.727 --> 00:08:39.764
to see how this magnificent development

00:08:39.788 --> 00:08:42.376
actually turns into memories
and the marvel that is us.

00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:44.176
And it's not just our own existence,

00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:47.042
but how does the woman's body understand

00:08:47.066 --> 00:08:49.747
to have genetic structure
that not only builds her own,

00:08:49.771 --> 00:08:51.276
but then has the understanding

00:08:51.300 --> 00:08:52.976
that allows her to become

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.976
a walking immunological,
cardiovascular system

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:57.976
that basically is a mobile system

00:08:58.000 --> 00:08:59.835
that can actually nurture,

00:08:59.859 --> 00:09:01.976
treat this child with a kind of marvel

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:05.805
that is beyond, again,
our comprehension --

00:09:05.829 --> 00:09:09.014
the magic that is existence, that is us?

00:09:09.038 --> 00:09:10.176
Thank you.

00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:13.200
(Applause)
