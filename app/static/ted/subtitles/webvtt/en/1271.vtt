Narrator: Many of the tests are conducted

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:12.276
while Yves is strapped onto the wing,

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:15.057

is an integral part of the aircraft.

00:01:18.343 --> 00:01:21.976
Narrator: The wing has no steering
controls, no flaps, no rudder.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.976
Yves uses his body to steer the wing.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:26.976
Stefan Von Bergen: Well, he turns

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.381
by just putting his head
on one or the other side.

00:01:29.405 --> 00:01:31.976
And sometimes he assists that
with his hands,

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.417
sometimes even with the leg.

00:01:34.441 --> 00:01:38.540
He's acting as a human
fuselage, so to say.

00:01:38.564 --> 00:01:40.309
And that's quite unique.

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:44.914
Narrator: When he arches his back,
he gains altitude.

00:01:54.928 --> 00:01:58.285

he goes into a dive.

00:03:36.476 --> 00:03:37.976
There is Yves Rossy.

00:03:38.716 --> 00:03:40.976

So our first critical moment, it's open.

00:03:43.813 --> 00:03:46.384
He is down. Is he flying?

Commentator Two:
It looks like he's stabilized.

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:50.575
He's starting to make his climb.

There's that 90 degree turn.

00:03:52.838 --> 00:03:54.093

It's really an unreal feeling,

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:31.085
because normally you have a big thing,

00:05:31.109 --> 00:05:32.976
a plane, around you.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:38.526
And when I strap just this little harness,

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:40.106
this little wing,

00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:42.382
I really have the feeling of being a bird.

BG: How did you start to become Jetman?

00:05:45.162 --> 00:05:47.281
YR: It was about 20 years ago,

00:05:47.305 --> 00:05:49.598
when I discovered free falling.

00:05:49.622 --> 00:05:54.015
When you go out of an airplane,
you are almost naked.

00:05:54.039 --> 00:05:55.638
You take a position like that.

00:05:56.126 --> 00:05:59.936
And especially when you take
a tracking position,

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:02.976
you have the feeling that you are flying.

00:06:03.509 --> 00:06:07.670
And that's the nearest thing to the dream.

00:06:07.694 --> 00:06:10.182
You have no machine around you.

00:06:10.206 --> 00:06:11.976
You are just in the element.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.999
It's very short and only in one direction.

00:06:15.023 --> 00:06:16.059
(Laughter)

00:06:16.083 --> 00:06:19.005
So the idea was, okay,

00:06:19.029 --> 00:06:22.368
keep that feeling of freedom,

00:06:22.392 --> 00:06:25.765
but change the vector
and increase the time.

00:06:25.789 --> 00:06:28.158
BG: So I'm kind of curious,
what's your top speed?

00:06:28.761 --> 00:06:31.976
YR: It's about 300 km per hour
before looping.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.181
That means about 190 miles per hour.

00:06:35.205 --> 00:06:37.810
BG: What's the weight
of the equipment you're carrying?

00:06:37.834 --> 00:06:40.454

00:06:40.478 --> 00:06:43.211

I have 55 kilos on my back.

00:06:45.709 --> 00:06:47.113
BG: And you're not piloting?

00:06:47.137 --> 00:06:49.615
There is no handle, no steering, nothing?

00:06:49.639 --> 00:06:51.177
It is purely your body,

00:06:51.201 --> 00:06:53.678
and the wings become part
of the body and vice versa?

00:06:53.702 --> 00:06:55.130
YR: That's really the goal,

00:06:55.154 --> 00:06:57.890
because if you put in steering,

00:06:57.914 --> 00:07:00.555
then you reinvent the airplane.

00:07:00.579 --> 00:07:05.166
And I wanted to keep this
freedom of movement.

00:07:05.190 --> 00:07:08.174
And it's really like the kid
playing the airplane.

00:07:08.198 --> 00:07:09.848
I want to go down like that.

00:07:09.872 --> 00:07:12.325
And up I climb, I turn.

00:07:12.349 --> 00:07:15.698
It's really pure flying.

00:07:15.722 --> 00:07:18.575
It's not steering, it's flight.

00:07:18.599 --> 00:07:22.976

you personally, for that?

00:07:23.614 --> 00:07:26.976
YR: Actually, I try to stay just fit.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:32.067
I don't do special physical training.

00:07:32.091 --> 00:07:39.068
I just try to keep my mobility
through new activities.

00:07:39.863 --> 00:07:44.823
For example, last winter
I began with kite surfing.

00:07:44.847 --> 00:07:45.976
So, new things.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:47.976
So you have to adapt.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:53.555
I'm quite an experienced
manager of systems as a pilot,

00:07:53.579 --> 00:07:54.976
but this is, really --

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.364
You need fluidity,

00:07:57.388 --> 00:07:59.856
you need to be agile

00:07:59.880 --> 00:08:02.356
and also to adapt really fast.

00:08:02.380 --> 00:08:04.190
BG: Somebody in the audience asked me,

00:08:04.214 --> 00:08:05.976
"How does he breathe up there?"

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.977
Because you're going fast
and you're up at 3,000 meters or so.

00:08:09.001 --> 00:08:11.253
YR: Okay, up to 3,000 meters,

00:08:11.277 --> 00:08:14.943
it's not such a big problem with oxygen.

00:08:14.967 --> 00:08:17.529
But for example, bikers,

00:08:17.553 --> 00:08:19.524
they have the same speed.

00:08:19.548 --> 00:08:21.938
Just with the helmet, integral helmet,

00:08:21.962 --> 00:08:23.914
it's really no problem to breathe.

00:08:23.938 --> 00:08:26.705
BG: Describe for me the equipment,
since you have it here.

00:08:26.729 --> 00:08:28.820

turbines, working with kerosene.

00:08:40.800 --> 00:08:43.658
Harness, parachute.

00:08:43.682 --> 00:08:46.865
My only instruments
are an altimeter and time.

00:08:46.889 --> 00:08:50.044
I know I have about eight minutes fuel.

00:08:50.560 --> 00:08:52.976
So I just check before it's finished.

00:08:53.337 --> 00:08:55.480
(Laughter)

00:08:56.369 --> 00:08:57.976
And yeah, that's all.

00:08:58.655 --> 00:09:00.703
Two parachutes.

00:09:01.441 --> 00:09:06.118
That means, if I have a problem
with the first one I pull,

00:09:06.142 --> 00:09:09.760
I still have the possibility
to open the second one.

00:09:09.784 --> 00:09:11.180
And this is my life.

00:09:11.204 --> 00:09:14.220
That's the real important
thing about safety.

00:09:14.807 --> 00:09:18.379
I did use that during these last 15 years

00:09:18.403 --> 00:09:20.242
about 20 times.

00:09:20.266 --> 00:09:23.544
Never with that type of wing,
but at the beginning.

00:09:23.568 --> 00:09:26.607
I can release my wing

00:09:26.631 --> 00:09:29.757
when I am in a spin or unstable.

00:09:29.781 --> 00:09:32.474
BG: We saw the 2009 crossing
of the Gibraltar Strait

00:09:32.498 --> 00:09:33.976
where you lost control

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.785
and then you dived down into the clouds

00:09:36.809 --> 00:09:37.976
and in the ocean.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:41.797
So that was one of those cases
where you let the wings go, right?

00:09:41.821 --> 00:09:44.246
YR: Yeah. I did try in the clouds,

00:09:44.270 --> 00:09:46.976
but you lose orientation completely.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.556
So I did try to take, again,

00:09:49.580 --> 00:09:52.508
a climb altitude.

00:09:52.532 --> 00:09:54.580
I thought, okay, I will go out.

00:09:54.604 --> 00:09:57.395
But most probably,
I did something like that.

00:09:57.419 --> 00:09:58.489
(Laughter)

00:09:58.513 --> 00:10:00.976
BG: Something that is not
very safe, the image.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:04.045
YR: You feel great, but --

00:10:04.069 --> 00:10:06.323
(Laughter)

00:10:06.347 --> 00:10:08.291
But you have not the right altitude.

00:10:08.810 --> 00:10:11.508
So the next thing I saw was just blue.

00:10:11.532 --> 00:10:12.976
It was the sea.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.986
I have also an audible altimeter.

00:10:16.010 --> 00:10:18.312
So I was at my minimum altitude

00:10:18.336 --> 00:10:21.644
in that vector -- fast --

00:10:21.668 --> 00:10:23.521
so I pulled that.

00:10:23.545 --> 00:10:24.943
And then I did open my chute.

00:10:24.967 --> 00:10:28.539
BG: So the wings have their own parachute,
and you have your two parachutes.

00:10:28.563 --> 00:10:31.174
YR: Exactly. There is a rescue
parachute for the wing

00:10:31.198 --> 00:10:32.976
for two reasons:

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:34.715
so I can repair it afterward

00:10:34.739 --> 00:10:40.085
and especially so nobody takes
that, just on his head.

00:10:40.109 --> 00:10:42.340
BG: I see. Maybe come back here.

00:10:42.364 --> 00:10:44.793
This is risky stuff indeed.

00:10:44.817 --> 00:10:47.742
People have died trying
to do this kind of thing.

00:10:47.766 --> 00:10:50.862
And you don't look like a crazy guy;
you're a Swiss airline pilot,

00:10:50.886 --> 00:10:53.652
so you're rather a checklist kind of guy.

00:10:53.676 --> 00:10:55.446
I assume you have standards.

00:10:55.470 --> 00:10:58.177
YR: Yeah. I have no checklist for that.

00:10:58.201 --> 00:10:59.299
(Laughter)

00:10:59.323 --> 00:11:00.974
BG: Let's not tell your employer.

00:11:00.998 --> 00:11:02.090
(Laughter)

00:11:02.114 --> 00:11:04.000
YR: No, that's really two worlds.

00:11:05.686 --> 00:11:08.782
Civil aviation is something
that we know very well.

00:11:08.806 --> 00:11:11.702
We have a hundred years of experience.

00:11:11.726 --> 00:11:15.960
And you can adapt really precisely.

00:11:15.984 --> 00:11:18.976
With that, I have to adapt
to something new.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:20.563
That means improvise.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:24.230
So it's really a play
between these two approaches.

00:11:24.254 --> 00:11:27.469
Something that I know
very well, these principles.

00:11:27.493 --> 00:11:30.754
For example, we have
two engines on an Airbus;

00:11:30.778 --> 00:11:33.133
with only one engine, you can fly it.

00:11:33.157 --> 00:11:35.744
So plan B, always a plan B.

00:11:35.768 --> 00:11:37.674
In a fighter, you have an ejection seat.

00:11:37.698 --> 00:11:39.725
That's my ejection seat.

00:11:39.749 --> 00:11:42.725
So I have the approach
of a professional pilot

00:11:42.749 --> 00:11:47.994
with the respect of a pioneer

00:11:48.018 --> 00:11:49.722
in front of Mother Nature.

00:11:50.501 --> 00:11:52.976
BG: It's well said.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.132
What happens if one of the engines stops?

00:11:56.144 --> 00:11:59.773
YR: I do a roll.

00:11:59.797 --> 00:12:03.081
And then I stabilize,

00:12:03.105 --> 00:12:07.077
and according to my altitude,
I continue on two or three engines.

00:12:07.101 --> 00:12:08.658
It's sometimes possible.

00:12:08.682 --> 00:12:11.859
It's quite complicated to explain,

00:12:11.883 --> 00:12:15.253
but according to which regime I was,

00:12:15.277 --> 00:12:16.976
I can continue on two

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:20.619
and try to get a nice place to land,
and then I open my parachute.

00:12:20.643 --> 00:12:22.264
BG: So the beginning of the flight

00:12:22.288 --> 00:12:24.660
is actually you jump
off a plane or a helicopter,

00:12:24.684 --> 00:12:27.403
and you go on a dive
and accelerate the engines,

00:12:27.427 --> 00:12:29.976
and then you basically take off
mid-air somewhere.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:31.976
And then the landing, as we have seen,

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.842
arriving on this side of the Channel,

00:12:34.866 --> 00:12:36.561
is through a parachute.

00:12:36.585 --> 00:12:38.450
So just as a curiosity,

00:12:38.474 --> 00:12:41.331
where did you land when you flew
over the Grand Canyon?

00:12:41.896 --> 00:12:43.976
Did you land on the rim,
down at the bottom?

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:46.270
YR: It was down on the bottom.

00:12:46.294 --> 00:12:50.646
And I came back afterward
on the sled of the helicopter back.

00:12:50.670 --> 00:12:55.079
But it was too stony
and full of cactus on top.

00:12:55.103 --> 00:12:56.119
(Laughter)

00:12:56.143 --> 00:12:58.285
BG: That's exactly
why I asked the question.

00:12:58.309 --> 00:13:02.134
YR: And also, the currents
are quite funny there.

00:13:02.158 --> 00:13:04.364
There is big thermal activity,

00:13:04.388 --> 00:13:06.420
big difference in altitude also.

00:13:06.444 --> 00:13:10.353
So it was much safer for me
to land at the bottom.

00:13:10.941 --> 00:13:13.694
BG: I think that right now,
many people are asking,

00:13:13.718 --> 00:13:15.686
"When are you developing a double-seater

00:13:15.710 --> 00:13:16.976
so they can fly with you?"

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:19.182
YR: I have a standard answer.

00:13:19.206 --> 00:13:22.682
Have you ever seen tandem birds?

00:13:23.204 --> 00:13:24.207
(Laughter)

00:13:24.231 --> 00:13:25.372
BG: Perfect answer.

00:13:25.396 --> 00:13:28.446
(Applause)

00:13:33.803 --> 00:13:34.976
(Applause ends)

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:37.697
BG: Yves, one last question.

00:13:37.721 --> 00:13:39.976
What's next for you?
What's next for Jetman?

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:44.311
YR: First, to instruct a younger guy.

00:13:44.335 --> 00:13:47.354
I want to share it,
to do formation flights.

00:13:47.904 --> 00:13:50.418
And I plan to start from a cliff,

00:13:50.442 --> 00:13:52.323
like catapulted from a cliff.

00:13:52.347 --> 00:13:54.348
BG: So instead of jumping
off a plane, yes?

00:13:54.372 --> 00:13:58.276
YR: Yes, with the final goal to take off,
but with initial speed.

00:13:58.605 --> 00:14:00.612
Really, I go step by step.

00:14:00.636 --> 00:14:03.720
It seems a little bit crazy, but it's not.

00:14:03.744 --> 00:14:07.299
It's possible to start already now,
it's just too dangerous.

00:14:07.323 --> 00:14:09.283
(Laughter)

00:14:09.307 --> 00:14:14.695
Thanks to the increasing technology,
better technology,

00:14:14.719 --> 00:14:16.002
it will be safe.

00:14:16.026 --> 00:14:17.976
And I hope it will be for everybody.

00:14:18.811 --> 00:14:20.813
BG: Yves, thank you very much. Yves Rossy.

00:14:20.837 --> 00:14:23.897
(Applause)
