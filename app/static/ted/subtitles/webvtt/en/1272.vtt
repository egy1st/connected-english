00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.346
I've always had a fascination
for computers and technology,

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:08.070
and I made a few apps for the iPhone,
iPod touch, and iPad.

00:00:08.094 --> 00:00:10.536
I'd like to share a couple with you today.

00:00:11.189 --> 00:00:15.260
My first app was a unique
fortune teller called "Earth Fortune"

00:00:15.284 --> 00:00:17.673
that would display
different colors of Earth

00:00:17.697 --> 00:00:19.679
depending on what your fortune was.

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:23.993
My favorite and most successful app

00:00:24.017 --> 00:00:25.878
is "Bustin Jieber," which is --

00:00:25.902 --> 00:00:27.125
(Laughter)

00:00:27.149 --> 00:00:29.843
which is a Justin Bieber whack-a-mole.

00:00:29.867 --> 00:00:31.176
(Laughter)

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:34.583
I created it because
a lot of people at school

00:00:34.607 --> 00:00:36.924
disliked Justin Bieber a little bit,

00:00:36.948 --> 00:00:39.694
so I decided to make the app.

00:00:39.718 --> 00:00:41.873
So I went to work programming it,

00:00:41.897 --> 00:00:45.563
and I released it
just before the holidays in 2010.

00:00:46.724 --> 00:00:50.476
A lot of people ask me,
how did I make these?

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:53.392
A lot of times it's because
the person who asked the question

00:00:53.416 --> 00:00:55.438
wants to make an app also.

00:00:55.462 --> 00:00:58.565
A lot of kids these days
like to play games,

00:00:58.589 --> 00:01:02.119
but now they want to make them,
and it's difficult,

00:01:02.143 --> 00:01:07.079
because not many kids know where to go
to find out how to make a program.

00:01:07.103 --> 00:01:09.598
I mean, for soccer,
you could go to a soccer team.

00:01:09.622 --> 00:01:12.639
For violin, you could get
lessons for a violin.

00:01:12.663 --> 00:01:14.650
But what if you want to make an app?

00:01:14.674 --> 00:01:18.681
And the kid's parents might have done
some of these things when they were young,

00:01:18.705 --> 00:01:20.563
but not many parents have written apps.

00:01:20.587 --> 00:01:22.894
(Laughter)

00:01:22.918 --> 00:01:25.467
Where do you go to find out
how to make an app?

00:01:25.491 --> 00:01:28.227
Well, this is how I approached it,
this is what I did.

00:01:28.251 --> 00:01:33.425
First of all, I've been programming
in multiple other programming languages

00:01:33.449 --> 00:01:35.459
to get the basics down,

00:01:35.483 --> 00:01:39.078
such as Python, C, Java, etc.

00:01:39.761 --> 00:01:42.234
And then Apple released the iPhone,

00:01:42.258 --> 00:01:45.272
and with it, the iPhone
software development kit,

00:01:45.296 --> 00:01:48.875
and the software development kit
is a suite of tools

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:51.601
for creating and programming
an iPhone app.

00:01:52.888 --> 00:01:56.216
This opened up a whole new world
of possibilities for me,

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:59.510
and after playing with the software
development kit a little bit,

00:01:59.534 --> 00:02:03.421
I made a couple of apps,
I made some test apps.

00:02:03.445 --> 00:02:05.588
One of them happened to be
"Earth Fortune,"

00:02:05.612 --> 00:02:08.480
and I was ready to put
"Earth Fortune" on the App Store,

00:02:08.504 --> 00:02:12.879
and so I persuaded my parents
to pay the 99 dollar fee

00:02:12.903 --> 00:02:15.699
to be able to put my apps
on the App Store.

00:02:15.723 --> 00:02:18.693
They agreed, and now I have
apps on the App Store.

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:22.363
I've gotten a lot of interest
and encouragement

00:02:22.387 --> 00:02:26.056
from my family, friends, teachers
and even people at the Apple Store,

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:28.061
and that's been a huge help to me.

00:02:29.116 --> 00:02:32.218
I've gotten a lot
of inspiration from Steve Jobs,

00:02:32.242 --> 00:02:35.151
and I've started an app club at school,

00:02:35.175 --> 00:02:40.286
and a teacher at my school
is kindly sponsoring my app club.

00:02:40.821 --> 00:02:45.592
Any student at my school can come
and learn how to design an app.

00:02:47.274 --> 00:02:50.498
This is so I can share
my experiences with others.

00:02:51.404 --> 00:02:54.942
There's these programs
called the iPad Pilot Program,

00:02:54.966 --> 00:02:57.536
and some districts have them.

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:59.773
I'm fortunate enough to be part of one.

00:03:00.243 --> 00:03:04.242
A big challenge is,
how should the iPads be used,

00:03:04.266 --> 00:03:06.956
and what apps should we put on the iPads?

00:03:07.714 --> 00:03:11.516
So we're getting feedback
from teachers at the school

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:13.608
to see what kind of apps they'd like.

00:03:13.632 --> 00:03:16.416
When we design the app and we sell it,

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:22.259
it will be free to local districts;
and other districts that we sell to --

00:03:22.883 --> 00:03:26.203
all the money from that will go
into the local ed foundations.

00:03:27.776 --> 00:03:32.854
These days, students usually know
a little bit more than teachers

00:03:32.878 --> 00:03:34.438
with the technology.

00:03:34.462 --> 00:03:38.777
(Laughter)

00:03:38.801 --> 00:03:40.025
So --

00:03:40.049 --> 00:03:42.988
(Laughter)

00:03:43.012 --> 00:03:44.198
Sorry.

00:03:44.222 --> 00:03:46.885
(Laughter)

00:03:47.536 --> 00:03:49.615
So this is a resource to teachers,

00:03:49.639 --> 00:03:53.734
and educators should recognize
this resource and make good use of it.

00:03:53.758 --> 00:03:55.440
(Laughter)

00:03:56.333 --> 00:04:00.044
I'd like to finish up by saying
what I'd like to do in the future.

00:04:01.073 --> 00:04:05.052
First of all, I'd like to create
more apps, more games.

00:04:05.076 --> 00:04:08.006
I'm working with a third party
company to make an app.

00:04:08.741 --> 00:04:12.635
I'd like to get into Android
programming and development,

00:04:12.659 --> 00:04:14.946
and I'd like to continue my app club,

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:18.595
and find other ways for students
to share knowledge with others.

00:04:18.619 --> 00:04:19.778
Thank you.

00:04:19.802 --> 00:04:21.336
(Applause)
