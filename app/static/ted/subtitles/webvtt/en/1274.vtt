00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Have you ever wanted to stay young a little longer

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
and put off aging?

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
This is a dream of the ages.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
But scientists have for a long time

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
thought this just was never going to be possible.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
They thought you just wear out, there's nothing you can do about it --

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
kind of like an old shoe.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
But if you look in nature,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
you see that different kinds of animals

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
can have really different lifespans.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Now these animals are different from one another,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
because they have different genes.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
So that suggests

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
that somewhere in these genes, somewhere in the DNA,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
are genes for aging,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
genes that allow them to have different lifespans.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
So if there are genes like that,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
then you can imagine that,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
if you could change one of the genes in an experiment,

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
an aging gene,

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
maybe you could slow down aging and extend lifespan.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
And if you could do that, then you could find the genes for aging.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
And if they exist and you can find them,

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
then maybe one could eventually do something about it.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
So we've set out to look for genes that control aging.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
And we didn't study any of these animals.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
Instead, we studied a little, tiny, round worm called C. elegans,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
which is just about the size of a comma in a sentence.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
And we were really optimistic that we could find something

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
because there had been a report of a long-lived mutant.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
So we started to change genes at random,

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
looking for long-lived animals.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
And we were very lucky to find

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.000
that mutations that damage one single gene called daf-2

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
doubled the lifespan of the little worm.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
So you can see in black, after a month --

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
they're very short-lived; that's why we like to study them

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
for studies of aging --

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
in black, after a month, the normal worms are all dead.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
But at that time,

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
most of the mutant worms are still alive.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
And it isn't until twice as long

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
that they're all dead.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
And now I want to show what they actually look like in this movie here.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
So the first thing you're going to see

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
is the normal worm

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000
when it's about college student age -- a young adult.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
It's quite a cute little fellow.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
And next you're going to see the long-lived mutant when it's young.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
So this animal is going to live twice as long.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
Is it miserable? It doesn't seem to be.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
It's active. You can't tell the difference really.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
And they can be completely fertile --

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
have the same number of progeny as the normal worms do.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
Now get out your handkerchiefs here.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
You're going to see, in just two weeks,

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
the normal worms are old.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
You can see the little head moving down at the bottom there.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
But everything else is just lying there.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
The animal's clearly in the nursing home.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000
And if you look at the tissues of the animal, they're starting to deteriorate.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
You know, even if you've never seen one of these little C. elegans --

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
which probably most of you haven't seen one --

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
you can tell they're old -- isn't that interesting?

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000
So there's something about aging that's kind of universal.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000
And now here is the daf-2 mutant.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000
One gene is changed out of 20,000, and look at it.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000
It's the same age, but it's not in the nursing home;

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000
it's going skiing.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000
This is what's really cool: it's aging more slowly.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
It takes this worm two days

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
to age as much as the normal worm ages in one day.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
And when I tell people about this,

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.000
they tend to think of maybe an 80 or 90 year-old person

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
who looks really good for being 90 or 80.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000
But it's really more like this:

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000
let's say you're a 30 year-old guy -- or in your 30s --

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
and you're a bachelor and you're dating people.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000
And you meet someone you really like, you get to know her.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000
And you're in a restaurant, and you say, "Well how old are you?"

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
She says, "I'm 60."

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000
That's what it's like. And you would never know.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000
You would never know, until she told you.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.000
(Laughter)

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
Okay.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
So what is the daf-2 gene?

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
Well as you know, genes, which are part of the DNA,

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000
they're instructions to make a protein that does something.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000
And the daf-2 gene

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000
encodes a hormone receptor.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000
So what you see in the picture there

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000
is a cell with a hormone receptor in red

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000
punching through the edge of the cell.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000
So part of it is like a baseball glove.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000
Part of it's on the outside,

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000
and it's catching the hormone as it comes by in green.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000
And the other part is on the inside

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000
where it sends signals into the cell.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000
Okay, so what is the daf-2 receptor

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000
telling the inside of the cell?

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
I just told you that, if you make a mutation in the daf-2 gene cell,

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
that you get a receptor that doesn't work as well;

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000
the animal lives longer.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.000
So that means that the normal function of this hormone receptor

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000
is to speed up aging.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000
That's what that arrow means.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000
It speeds up aging. It makes it go faster.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000
So it's like the animal has the grim reaper inside of itself,

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000
speeding up aging.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.000
So this is altogether really, really interesting.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.000
It says that aging is subject to control by the genes,

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.000
and specifically by hormones.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
So what kind of hormones are these?

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
There's lots of hormones. There's testosterone, adrenalin.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
You know about a lot of them.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000
These hormones are similar

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000
to hormones that we have in our bodies.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000
The daf-2 hormone receptor

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000
is very similar to the receptor

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.000
for the hormone insulin and IGF-1.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000
Now you've all heard of at least insulin.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000
Insulin is a hormone that promotes the uptake of nutrients

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000
into your tissues after you eat a meal.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.000
And the hormone IGF-1 promotes growth.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.000
So these functions were known for these hormones for a long time,

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000
but our studies suggested

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000
that maybe they had a third function that nobody knew about --

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000
maybe they also affect aging.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000
And it's looking like that's the case.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.000
So after we made our discoveries with little C. elegans,

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000
people who worked on other kinds of animals

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.000
started asking, if we made the same daf-2 mutation,

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.000
the hormone receptor mutation, in other animals,

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000
will they live longer?

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000
And that is the case in flies.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.000
If you change this hormone pathway in flies, they live longer.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.000
And also in mice -- and mice are mammals like us.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000
So it's an ancient pathway,

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000
because it must have arisen a long time ago in evolution

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.000
such that it still works in all these animals.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.000
And also, the common precursor also gave rise to people.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000
So maybe it's working in people the same way.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000
And there are hints of this.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000
So for example, there was one study that was done

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.000
in a population of Ashkenazi Jews in New York City.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000
And just like any population,

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.000
most of the people live to be about 70 or 80,

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000
but some live to be 90 or 100.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000
And what they found

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.000
was that people who lived to 90 or 100

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.000
were more likely to have daf-2 mutations --

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000
that is, changes in the gene

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.000
that encodes the receptor for IGF-1.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:08.000
And these changes made the gene not act as well

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000
as the normal gene would have acted.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000
It damaged the gene.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000
So those are hints

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.000
suggesting that humans are susceptible

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.000
to the effects of the hormones for aging.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000
So the next question, of course, is:

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.000
Is there any effect on age-related disease?

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.000
As you age, you're much more likely

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000
to get cancer, Alzheimer's disease,

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000
heart disease, all sorts of diseases.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000
It turns out that these long-lived mutants

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.000
are more resistant to all these diseases.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.000
They hardly get cancer,

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.000
and when they do it's not as severe.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000
So it's really interesting, and it makes sense in a way,

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.000
that they're still young,

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.000
so why would they be getting diseases of aging until their old?

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000
So it suggests

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.000
that, if we could have a therapeutic or a pill to take

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.000
to replicate some of these effects in humans,

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000
maybe we would have a way

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000
of combating lots of different age-related diseases

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.000
all at once.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000
So how can a hormone ultimately affect the rate of aging?

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000
How could that work?

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.000
Well it turns out that in the daf-2 mutants,

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:08.000
a whole lot of genes are switched on in the DNA

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:11.000
that encode proteins that protect the cells and the tissues,

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.000
and repair damage.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:16.000
And the way that they're switched on

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:19.000
is by a gene regulator protein called FOXO.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.000
So in a daf-2 mutant --

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.000
you see that I have the X drawn here through the receptor.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.000
The receptor isn't working as well.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:28.000
Under those conditions, the FOXO protein in blue

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000
has gone into the nucleus --

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000
that little compartment there in the middle of the cell --

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.000
and it's sitting down on a gene binding to it.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000
You see one gene. There are lots of genes actually that bind on FOXO.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.000
And it's just sitting on one of them.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.000
So FOXO turns on a lot of genes.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.000
And the genes it turns on includes antioxidant genes,

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.000
genes I call carrot-giver genes,

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.000
whose protein products

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.000
actually help other proteins to function well --

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.000
to fold correctly and function correctly.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:54.000
And it can also escort them to the garbage cans of the cell

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.000
and recycle them if they're damaged.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.000
DNA repair genes

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000
are more active in these animals.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000
And the immune system is more active.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:05.000
And many of these different genes, we've shown,

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:08.000
actually contribute to the long lifespan of the daf-2 mutant.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.000
So it's really interesting.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000
These animals have within them

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.000
the latent capacity to live much longer than they normally do.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.000
They have the ability

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.000
to protect themselves from many kinds of damage,

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:22.000
which we think makes them live longer.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.000
So what about the normal worm?

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.000
Well when the daf-2 receptor is active,

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.000
then it triggers a series of events

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000
that prevent FOXO

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:34.000
from getting into the nucleus where the DNA is.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.000
So it can't turn the genes on.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.000
That's how it works. That's why we don't see the long lifespan,

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.000
until we have the daf-2 mutant.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000
But what good is this for the worm?

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.000
Well we think that insulin and IGF-1 hormones

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.000
are hormones that are particularly active

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.000
under favorable conditions -- in the good times --

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:52.000
when food is plentiful and there's not a lot of stress in the environment.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.000
Then they promote the uptake of nutrients.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:57.000
You can store the food, use it for energy,

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.000
grow, etc.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:02.000
But what we think is that, under conditions of stress,

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000
the levels of these hormones drop --

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:07.000
for example, having limited food supply.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.000
And that, we think,

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.000
is registered by the animal as a danger signal,

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.000
a signal that things are not okay

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:16.000
and that it should roll out its protective capacity.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:19.000
So it activates FOXO, FOXO goes to the DNA,

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.000
and that triggers the expression of these genes

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.000
that improves the ability of the cell

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.000
to protect itself and repair itself.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.000
And that's why we think the animals live longer.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.000
So you can think of FOXO

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:32.000
as being like a building superintendent.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.000
So maybe he's a little bit lazy,

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.000
but he's there, he's taking care of the building.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.000
But it's deteriorating.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:41.000
And then suddenly, he learns that there's going to be a hurricane.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.000
So he doesn't actually do anything himself.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.000
He gets on the telephone --

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.000
just like FOXO gets on the DNA --

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.000
and he calls up

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.000
the roofer, the window person,

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:54.000
the painter, the floor person.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.000
And they all come and they fortify the house.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.000
And then the hurricane comes through,

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.000
and the house is in much better condition than it would normally have been in.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.000
And not only that, it can also just last longer,

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.000
even if there isn't a hurricane.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.000
So that's the concept here

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:11.000
for how we think this life extension ability exists.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.000
Now the really cool thing about FOXO

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.000
is that there are different forms of it.

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:18.000
We all have FOXO genes,

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:21.000
but we don't all have exactly the same form of the FOXO gene.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.000
Just like we all have eyes,

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:26.000
but some of us have blue eyes and some of us have brown eyes.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:29.000
And there are certain forms of the FOXO gene

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.000
that have found to be more frequently present

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:33.000
in people who live to be 90 or 100.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.000
And that's the case all over the world,

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.000
as you can see from these stars.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.000
And each one of these stars represents a population

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.000
where scientists have asked,

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.000
"Okay, are there differences in the type of FOXO genes

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:46.000
among people who live a really long time?" and there are.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.000
We don't know the details of how this works,

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.000
but we do know then

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.000
that FOXO genes can impact

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:54.000
the lifespan of people.

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:57.000
And that means that, maybe if we tweak it a little bit,

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:01.000
we can increase the health and longevity of people.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:03.000
So this is really exciting to me.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:05.000
A FOXO is a protein that we found in these little, round worms

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:07.000
to affect lifespan,

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.000
and here it affects lifespan in people.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.000
So we've been trying in our lab now

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.000
to develop drugs

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.000
that will activate this FOXO cell

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.000
using human cells now

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.000
in order to try and come up with drugs

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:22.000
that will delay aging and age-related diseases.

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:25.000
And I'm really optimistic that this is going to work.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:28.000
There are lots of different proteins that are known to affect aging.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:31.000
And for at least one of them, there is a drug.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:33.000
There's one called TOR, which is another nutrient sensor,

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.000
like the insulin pathway.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:37.000
And mutations that damage the TOR gene --

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.000
just like the daf-2 mutations --

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.000
extend lifespan in worms

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:44.000
and flies and mice.

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:46.000
But in this case, there's already a drug called rapamycin

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.000
that binds to the TOR protein

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.000
and inhibits its activity.

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:53.000
And you can take rapamycin and give it to a mouse --

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.000
even when it's pretty old, like age 60 for a human,

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:57.000
that old for a mouse --

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.000
if you give the mouse rapamycin,

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.000
it will live longer.

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.000
Now I don't want you all to go out taking rapamycin.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:05.000
It is a drug for people,

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:08.000
but the reason is it suppresses the immune system.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:12.000
So people take it to prevent organ transplants from being rejected.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.000
So this may not be the perfect drug

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.000
for staying young longer.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:19.000
But still, here in the year 2011,

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:21.000
there's a drug that you can give to mice at a pretty old age

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:23.000
that will extend their lifespan,

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:25.000
which comes out of this science

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.000
that's been done in all these different animals.

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:29.000
So I'm really optimistic,

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:31.000
and I think it won't be too long, I hope,

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:34.000
before this age-old dream begins to come true.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.000
Thank you.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:45.000
(Applause)

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:48.000
Matt Ridley: Thank you, Cynthia.

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.000
Let me get this straight.

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:52.000
Although you're looking for a drug

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.000
that can solve aging

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:57.000
in old men like me,

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:00.000
what you could do now pretty well in the lab,

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.000
if you were allowed ethically,

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:05.000
is start a human life from scratch

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:08.000
with altered genes that would make it live for a lot longer?

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:11.000
CK: Ah, so the kinds of drugs I was talking about

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:13.000
would not change the genes,

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:16.000
they would just bind to the protein itself

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.000
and change its activity.

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:21.000
So if you stop taking the drug, the protein would go back to normal.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:24.000
You could change the genes in principle.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.000
There isn't the technology to do that.

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:28.000
But I don't think that's a good idea.

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.000
And the reason is

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.000
that these hormones,

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:35.000
like the insulin and the IGF hormones and the TOR pathway,

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:37.000
they're essential.

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:40.000
If you knock them out completely, then you're very sick.

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:43.000
So it might be that you would just have to fine tune it very carefully

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:46.000
to get the benefits without getting any problems.

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.000
And I think that's much better,

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.000
that kind of control would be much better as a drug.

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:53.000
And also, there are other ways of activating FOXO

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.000
that don't even involve insulin or IGF-1

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.000
that might even be safer.

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:00.000
MR: I wasn't suggesting that I was going to go and do it, but ...

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.000
(Laughter)

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:08.000
There's a phenomenon which you have written about and spoken about,

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:11.000
which is a negligible senescence.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:13.000
There are some creatures on this planet already

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:16.000
that don't really do aging.

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:19.000
Just move to one side for us, if you would.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:22.000
CK: There are. There are some animals that don't seem to age.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:26.000
For example, there are some tortoises called Blanding's turtles.

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.000
And they grow to be about this size.

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:31.000
And they've been tagged, and they've been found to be 70 years old.

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:33.000
And when you look at these 70 year-old turtles,

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:36.000
you can't tell the difference, just by looking,

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:38.000
between those turtles and 20 year-old turtles.

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:40.000
And the 70 year-old ones,

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:43.000
actually they're better at scouting out the good nesting places,

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:46.000
and they also have more progeny every year.

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:49.000
And there are other examples of these kinds of animals,

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:52.000
like turns, certain kinds of birds are like this.

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:54.000
And nobody knows if they really can live forever,

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:56.000
or what keeps them from aging.

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:58.000
It's not clear.

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:01.000
If you look at birds, which live a long time,

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:04.000
cells from the birds tend to be more resistant

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:06.000
to a lot of different environmental stresses

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:08.000
like high temperature

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:10.000
or hydrogen peroxide, things like that.

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:12.000
And our long-lived mutants are too.

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:14.000
They're more resistant to these kinds of stresses.

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:17.000
So it could be that the pathways that I've been talking about,

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:20.000
which are set to run really quickly in the worm,

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:23.000
have a different normal set point

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:26.000
in something like a bird, so that a bird can live a lot longer.

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:28.000
And maybe they're even set really differently

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:31.000
in animals with no senescence at all -- but we don't know.

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:33.000
MR: But what you're talking about here

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:36.000
is not extending human lifespan

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:38.000
by preventing death,

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:40.000
so much as extending human youthspan.

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:42.000
CK: Yes, that's right.

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:44.000
It's more like, say, if you were a dog.

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:46.000
You notice that you're getting old, and you look at your human

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:48.000
and you think, "Why isn't this human getting old?"

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:50.000
They're not getting old in the dog's lifespan.

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:52.000
It's more like that.

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:56.000
But now we're the human looking out and imagining a different human.

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:59.000
MR: Thank you very much indeed, Cynthia Kenyon.

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:02.000
(Applause)
