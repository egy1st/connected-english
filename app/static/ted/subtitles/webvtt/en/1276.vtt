WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
I'd like to apologize, first of all, to all of you

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
because I have no form

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
of PowerPoint presentation.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
So what I'm going to do

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
is, every now and again, I will make this gesture,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
and in a moment of PowerPoint democracy,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
you can imagine what you'd like to see.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
I do a radio show.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
The radio show is called "The Infinite Monkey Cage."

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
It's about science, it's about rationalism.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
So therefore, we get a lot of complaints

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
every single week --

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
complaints including one we get very often,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
which is to say the very title, "Infinite Monkey Cage,"

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
celebrates the idea of vivisection.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
We have made it quite clear to these people

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
that an infinite monkey cage is roomy.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
(Laughter)

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
We also had someone else who said,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
"'The Infinite Monkey Cage' idea is ridiculous.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
An infinite number of monkeys

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
could never write the works of Shakespeare.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
We know this because they did an experiment."

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.000
Yes, they gave 12 monkeys a typewriter for a week,

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
and after a week, they only used it as a bathroom.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
(Laughter)

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
So the main element though, the main complaint we get --

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
and one that I find most worrying --

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
is that people say, "Oh, why do you insist

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
on ruining the magic?

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
You bring in science, and it ruins the magic."

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
Now I'm an arts graduate;

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
I love myth and magic

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
and existentialism and self-loathing.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
That's what I do.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
But I also don't understand

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
how it does ruin the magic.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
All of the magic, I think,

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
that may well be taken away by science

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
is then replaced by something as wonderful.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
Astrology, for instance:

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
like many rationalists, I'm a Pisces.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
(Laughter)

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
Now astrology --

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
we remove the banal idea

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
that your life could be predicted;

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
that you'll, perhaps today, meet a lucky man

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
who's wearing a hat.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
That is gone.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
But if we want to look at the sky and see predictions, we still can.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
We can see predictions of galaxies forming,

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
of galaxies colliding into each other, of new solar systems.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
This is a wonderful thing.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
If the Sun could one day -- and indeed the Earth, in fact --

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.000
if the Earth could read its own astrological, astronomical chart,

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
one day it would say,

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
"Not a good day for making plans.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
You'll been engulfed by a red giant."

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
And that to me as well,

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
that if you think I'm worried about losing worlds,

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
well Many Worlds theory --

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
one of the most beautiful, fascinating,

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
sometimes terrifying ideas

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
from the quantum interpretation --

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
is a wonderful thing.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000
That every person here, every decision that you've made today,

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000
every decision you've made in your life,

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
you've not really made that decision,

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.000
but in fact, every single permutation of those decisions

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000
is made, each one going off into a new universe.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
That is a wonderful idea.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.000
If you ever think that your life is rubbish,

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
always remember

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
there's another you that's made much worse decisions than that.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
(Laughter)

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
If you ever think, "Ah, I want to end it all,"

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
don't end it all.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
Remember that in the majority of universes,

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
you don't even exist in the first place.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000
This to me, in its own strange way,

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
is very, very comforting.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
Now reincarnation, that's another thing gone -- the afterlife.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
But it's not gone.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
Science actually says

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000
we will live forever.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
Well, there is one proviso.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.000
We won't actually live forever. You won't live forever.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.000
Your consciousness, the you-ness of you, the me-ness of me --

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000
that gets this one go.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000
But every single thing that makes us,

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000
every atom in us,

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000
has already created a myriad of different things

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000
and will go on to create a myriad of new things.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000
We have been mountains

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000
and apples and pulsars

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000
and other people's knees.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.000
Who knows, maybe one of your atoms was once Napoleon's knee.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000
That is a good thing.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
Unlike the occupants of the universe,

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.000
the universe itself is not wasteful.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000
We are all totally recyclable.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000
And when we die,

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000
we don't even have to be placed in different refuse sacs.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000
This is a wonderful thing.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000
Understanding, to me,

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:17.000
does not remove the wonder and the joy.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.000
For instance, my wife could turn to me and she may say,

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000
"Why do you love me?"

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000
And I can with all honesty

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000
look her in the eye and say,

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
"Because our pheromones

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000
matched our olfactory receptors."

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000
(Laughter)

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000
Though I'll probably also say something

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000
about her hair and personality as well.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.000
And that is a wonderful thing there.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000
Love does not die because of that thing.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000
Pain doesn't go away either.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000
This is a terrible thing, even though I understand pain.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000
If someone punches me --

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000
and because of my personality,

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
this is recently a regular occurrence --

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000
I understand where the pain comes from.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000
It is basically momentum to energy

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000
where the four-vector is constant -- that's what it is.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000
But at no point can I react and go,

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:06.000
"Ha! Is that the best momentum-to-energy fourth vector constant you've got?"

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000
No, I just spit out a tooth.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000
(Laughter)

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.000
And that is all of these different things -- the love for my child.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000
I have a son. His name is Archie.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000
I'm very lucky,

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000
because he's better than all the other children.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000
Now I know you don't think that.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000
You may well have your own children

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.000
and think, "Oh no, my child's best."

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000
That's the wonderful thing about evolution --

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000
the predilection to believe

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000
that our child is best.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.000
Now in many ways, that's just a survival thing.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.000
The fact we see here is the vehicle for our genes,

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000
and therefore we love it.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.000
But we don't notice that bit; we just unconditionally love.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000
That is a wonderful thing.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000
Though I should say that my son is best

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.000
and is better than your children.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000
I've done some tests.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.000
And all of these things to me

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.000
give such joy and excitement and wonder.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.000
Even quantum mechanics can give you an excuse

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000
for bad housework, for instance.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.000
Perhaps you've been at home for a week on your own.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000
You house is in a terrible state.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.000
Your partner is about to return.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.000
You think, what should I do?

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.000
Do nothing.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000
All you have to do

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000
is, when she walks in, using a quantum interpretation,

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.000
say, "I'm so sorry.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.000
I stopped observing the house for a moment,

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.000
and when I started observing again,

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.000
everything had happened."

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000
(Laughter)

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.000
That's the strong anthropic principle of vacuuming.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.000
For me, it's a very, very important thing.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.000
Even on my journey up here --

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.000
the joy that I have on my journey up here every single time.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:40.000
If you actually think, you remove the myth and there is still something wonderful.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000
I'm sitting on a train.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000
Every time I breathe in,

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.000
I'm breathing in a million-billion-billion

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.000
atoms of oxygen.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.000
I'm sitting on a chair.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.000
Even though I know the chair is made of atoms

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000
and therefore actually in many ways empty space,

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000
I find it comfortable.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.000
I look out the window, and I realize

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000
that every single time we stop and I look out that window,

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000
framed in that window,

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000
wherever we are,

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.000
I am observing more life

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.000
than there is in the rest of the known universe

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000
beyond the planet Earth.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.000
If you go to the safari parks

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000
on Saturn or Jupiter,

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.000
you will be disappointed.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.000
And I realize I'm observing this

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.000
with the brain, the human brain,

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.000
the most complex thing in the known universe.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.000
That, to me, is an incredible thing.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.000
And do you know what, that might be enough.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:32.000
Steven Weinberg, the Nobel laureate, once said,

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.000
"The more the universe seems comprehensible,

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000
the more it seems pointless."

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.000
Now for some people,

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.000
that seems to lead to an idea of nihilism.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.000
But for me, it doesn't. That is a wonderful thing.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.000
I'm glad the universe is pointless.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.000
It means if I get to the end of my life,

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:50.000
the universe can't turn to me and go, "What have you been doing, you idiot?

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000
That's not the point."

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000
I can make my own purpose.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.000
You can make your own purpose.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.000
We have the individual power

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000
to go, "This is what I want to do."

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.000
And in a pointless universe, that, to me, is a wonderful thing.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.000
I have chosen to make silly jokes

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:08.000
about quantum mechanics and the Copenhagen interpretation.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:11.000
You, I imagine, can do much better things with your time.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.000
Thank you very much. Goodbye.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:17.000
