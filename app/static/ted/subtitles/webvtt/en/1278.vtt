WEBVTT

00:00:00.341 --> 00:00:01.666
I'm 36 years old.

00:00:01.690 --> 00:00:04.120
My first experience
with the video game business

00:00:04.144 --> 00:00:06.429
was neighbors who were wealthier than us

00:00:06.453 --> 00:00:09.014
bringing home an Atari 2600
and playing it.

00:00:09.038 --> 00:00:10.994
It was a pretty definitive moment for me.

00:00:11.409 --> 00:00:15.260
I also remember going to school,
and on an Apple II,

00:00:15.284 --> 00:00:18.328
playing a game called
"Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego?"

00:00:18.352 --> 00:00:20.412
an awesome game,

00:00:20.436 --> 00:00:24.710
which was the first time I played a game
in the school context.

00:00:24.734 --> 00:00:28.673
When you ask people about the video game
business and what's significant,

00:00:28.697 --> 00:00:32.342
most people think that Atari 2600
is really the nexus,

00:00:32.366 --> 00:00:34.380
the catalyst of the video game business.

00:00:34.404 --> 00:00:37.550
But I actually think that "Where
in the World is Carmen Sandiego?"

00:00:37.574 --> 00:00:40.148
is probably the most important
video game ever made,

00:00:40.172 --> 00:00:43.787
principally because it was
the first and the last time

00:00:43.811 --> 00:00:48.065
that parents, teachers and kids all agreed
that a video game was awesome.

00:00:48.089 --> 00:00:49.704
(Laughter)

00:00:49.728 --> 00:00:52.525
Now, that was a long time ago.

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:54.561
In fact, it was 1987.

00:00:54.585 --> 00:00:56.301
And it may surprise you to know

00:00:56.325 --> 00:00:59.250
that "Where in the World
is Carmen Sandiego?" continues to be

00:00:59.274 --> 00:01:03.029
the last substantial giant hit
in the entertainment business,

00:01:03.053 --> 00:01:07.570
despite the fact that it was 1987,
which is such an incredibly long time ago,

00:01:07.594 --> 00:01:10.335
and I'm only 36, so you can do the math.

00:01:10.359 --> 00:01:13.129
Things are completely different today
from what they were.

00:01:13.153 --> 00:01:14.421
Just as a simple example,

00:01:14.445 --> 00:01:16.848
in 1987, we thought
this guy was kind of crazy.

00:01:16.872 --> 00:01:18.797
Then we met this dude,

00:01:18.821 --> 00:01:21.839
who has really changed
our perspective on that subject.

00:01:21.863 --> 00:01:23.993
(Laughter)

00:01:24.017 --> 00:01:25.358
Things have changed.

00:01:25.382 --> 00:01:28.679
(Laughter)

00:01:28.703 --> 00:01:31.551
Anti-Bush political humor
goes a long way in Western Europe.

00:01:31.575 --> 00:01:32.600
(Laughter)

00:01:32.624 --> 00:01:35.329
So, between 1987 and now,

00:01:35.353 --> 00:01:37.691
I played a lot of this game
called "Civilization,"

00:01:37.715 --> 00:01:39.798
which was designed by a guy
named Sid Meier.

00:01:39.822 --> 00:01:44.099
In fact, I spent about 8- to 10,000
hours of my life playing "Civilization,"

00:01:44.123 --> 00:01:46.907
which is a long time I probably
should have spent studying.

00:01:46.931 --> 00:01:50.429
But nonetheless, I managed to turn
this love of video games into a job,

00:01:50.453 --> 00:01:52.730
first working on the Game
Developers Conference,

00:01:52.754 --> 00:01:56.493
helping to start the first successful
digital distribution company in games,

00:01:56.517 --> 00:01:57.674
called Trymedia,

00:01:57.698 --> 00:01:59.757
and then now, writing
the Gamification blog.

00:01:59.781 --> 00:02:02.367
I'm author of two books
on the subject of gamification,

00:02:02.391 --> 00:02:05.643
including the recent "Gamification
by Design," published by O'Reilly.

00:02:05.667 --> 00:02:07.393
And I chair the Gamification Summit,

00:02:07.417 --> 00:02:09.968
which is an event that brings
all this stuff together.

00:02:09.992 --> 00:02:12.400
So in many ways, I am parents' dream

00:02:12.424 --> 00:02:17.357
of how somebody can turn a sedentary
lifestyle of playing video games

00:02:17.381 --> 00:02:19.911
into an actual career
that pays real money.

00:02:19.935 --> 00:02:22.312
So when I get invited
to an event like this,

00:02:22.336 --> 00:02:25.098
I'm sure that all of you
expect me to get up here and say,

00:02:25.122 --> 00:02:27.013
"Games are awesome for your children."

00:02:27.037 --> 00:02:30.128
Right? Because I'm a games guy
and this is how I make my living.

00:02:30.152 --> 00:02:31.211
(Applause)

00:02:31.235 --> 00:02:32.459
Games will help children.

00:02:32.483 --> 00:02:34.959
But instead, I want to ask you
a different question,

00:02:34.983 --> 00:02:36.873
which is: Really, who needs games help?

00:02:36.897 --> 00:02:41.283
I started this process by thinking
about reading a particular article

00:02:41.307 --> 00:02:42.803
in the New York Times recently.

00:02:42.827 --> 00:02:45.221
In the article, a neuroscientist
was talking about

00:02:45.245 --> 00:02:48.662
how children were presenting themselves
with attention deficit disorder.

00:02:48.686 --> 00:02:50.402
Their parents would come in and say,

00:02:50.426 --> 00:02:52.780
"My kids can't possibly have ADD,

00:02:52.804 --> 00:02:55.958
because they're super good
at focusing on video games,

00:02:55.982 --> 00:02:58.229
But when they go to school,
they're really bad."

00:02:58.253 --> 00:03:01.048
The neuroscientist was debunking
this idea in the article.

00:03:01.072 --> 00:03:04.551
She trotted out researchers
like Dr Christopher Lucas at NYU,

00:03:04.575 --> 00:03:08.142
who said games don't teach
the right kind of attention skills

00:03:08.166 --> 00:03:10.697
where kids have sustained attention,

00:03:10.721 --> 00:03:12.884
where they're not receiving
regular rewards.

00:03:12.908 --> 00:03:14.259
And she trotted out experts

00:03:14.283 --> 00:03:17.118
like Dr Dimitri Christakis
at the University of Washington,

00:03:17.142 --> 00:03:19.426
who said that kids
who play a lot of video games

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:22.197
may find the real world unpalatable
or uninteresting,

00:03:22.221 --> 00:03:24.812
as a result of their
sensitization to games.

00:03:24.836 --> 00:03:28.414
So I sat there and thought to myself,
I'm scratching my head,

00:03:28.438 --> 00:03:31.799
is it that our children have ADD,

00:03:31.823 --> 00:03:37.392
or is our world just too freaking slow
for our children to appreciate?

00:03:37.416 --> 00:03:38.574
(Applause)

00:03:38.598 --> 00:03:42.037
Seriously, consider the picture
you're looking at right now,

00:03:42.061 --> 00:03:44.775
like in my era, even my grandfather's era,

00:03:44.799 --> 00:03:49.398
sitting down on a Sunday afternoon
to read a good book with a cup of tea --

00:03:49.422 --> 00:03:50.623
I just have to say,

00:03:50.647 --> 00:03:53.465
I don't think that today's kids
are ever going to do that.

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:55.982
The evidence is found
in the games they play.

00:03:56.006 --> 00:03:58.056
Consider the video game
"World of Warcraft."

00:03:58.080 --> 00:03:59.403
When I was growing up,

00:03:59.427 --> 00:04:02.759
the maximum skill that I was expected
to display in a video game

00:04:02.783 --> 00:04:04.394
was simple hand-eye coordination,

00:04:04.418 --> 00:04:06.212
a joystick and a firing button.

00:04:06.236 --> 00:04:09.265
Today's kids play games
in which they're expected to chat

00:04:09.289 --> 00:04:10.719
in text and voice,

00:04:10.743 --> 00:04:13.816
operate a character,
follow long- and short-term objectives,

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:17.428
and deal with their parents interrupting
them all the time to talk to them.

00:04:17.452 --> 00:04:18.545
(Laughter)

00:04:18.569 --> 00:04:21.373
Kids have to have
an extraordinary multitasking skill

00:04:21.397 --> 00:04:23.104
to be able to achieve things today.

00:04:23.128 --> 00:04:24.592
We never had to have that.

00:04:24.616 --> 00:04:29.160
It turns out things like that
actually make you smarter.

00:04:29.184 --> 00:04:32.668
Research by Arne May et Al
at the University of Regensburg in Germany

00:04:32.692 --> 00:04:36.758
found that when they gave participants --
this was actually done on adults --

00:04:36.782 --> 00:04:39.274
a simple task to learn, like juggling,

00:04:39.298 --> 00:04:40.788
in 12 weeks,

00:04:40.812 --> 00:04:42.679
people who were asked to learn juggling

00:04:42.703 --> 00:04:46.506
displayed a marked increase
in gray matter in their brain.

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:49.893
On an MRI, you can see
people get more gray matter

00:04:49.917 --> 00:04:51.799
after 12 weeks of learning juggling.

00:04:51.823 --> 00:04:54.502
In 2008, they went back
and redid the study

00:04:54.526 --> 00:04:56.581
to see why the gray matter increased.

00:04:56.605 --> 00:04:59.176
They discovered it was the act of learning

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:01.193
that produced the increased brain matter,

00:05:01.217 --> 00:05:03.814
not performance at the activity itself,

00:05:03.838 --> 00:05:05.683
which is a very interesting finding.

00:05:05.707 --> 00:05:09.724
It also reinforced this idea,
which should go over well here as well,

00:05:09.748 --> 00:05:13.222
that multilingual people
outperform monolingual people

00:05:13.246 --> 00:05:16.120
on most standardized tests by about 15%.

00:05:16.144 --> 00:05:19.654
There's something that happens
in the brain from that kind of activity.

00:05:19.678 --> 00:05:23.543
Andrea Kuszewski,
speaking at Harvard, talked about

00:05:23.567 --> 00:05:27.224
these five things that people do
to increase their grey matter

00:05:27.248 --> 00:05:30.589
and to teach themselves
to increase their fluid intelligence.

00:05:30.613 --> 00:05:34.296
"Fluid intelligence" is the intelligence
we use to problem-solve.

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:36.433
It's different from
crystalline intelligence,

00:05:36.457 --> 00:05:37.711
it helps us problem-solve.

00:05:37.735 --> 00:05:39.629
She identified, from the research,

00:05:39.653 --> 00:05:41.636
that there were five things you could do:

00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:42.811
seek novelty,

00:05:42.835 --> 00:05:43.986
challenge yourself,

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:45.161
think creatively,

00:05:45.185 --> 00:05:46.336
do things the hard way

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:47.511
and network.

00:05:47.535 --> 00:05:49.166
Think about those five things.

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:50.547
Any of you play video games?

00:05:50.571 --> 00:05:55.001
Does it resemble the basic pattern
of a video game to you in any way?

00:05:55.025 --> 00:05:58.931
These are five things that recur
in all very successful video games.

00:05:58.955 --> 00:06:04.332
It also is connected to a constant
and exponential increase in learning.

00:06:04.356 --> 00:06:08.801
Video games fundamentally present
a continuous process of learning to users.

00:06:08.825 --> 00:06:11.603
They don't just learn
for a little while and then stop.

00:06:11.627 --> 00:06:14.070
They're constantly evolving
and moving forward.

00:06:14.458 --> 00:06:18.467
It may, in fact, help us to explain
the Flynn effect, finally.

00:06:18.491 --> 00:06:20.938
The "Flynn effect,"
for those of you who don't know,

00:06:20.962 --> 00:06:24.278
is the pattern that human intelligence
is actually rising over time.

00:06:24.302 --> 00:06:28.205
So if we look at the history of IQ,
people, in fact, are getting smarter.

00:06:28.229 --> 00:06:29.504
In the US right now,

00:06:29.528 --> 00:06:34.213
average IQ is rising
at .36 points of IQ per year.

00:06:34.237 --> 00:06:36.960
What's been very interesting
is that in some countries --

00:06:36.984 --> 00:06:39.338
not to call anyone out,
but Denmark and Norway --

00:06:39.362 --> 00:06:42.377
in some countries, overall crystalline IQ

00:06:42.401 --> 00:06:45.440
has stopped or slowed down or declined.

00:06:45.464 --> 00:06:46.913
In other countries, though,

00:06:46.937 --> 00:06:50.090
particularly when looking at fluid IQ,
fluid intelligence,

00:06:50.114 --> 00:06:51.368
the number is increasing,

00:06:51.392 --> 00:06:55.192
and the rate of fluid intelligence
increase is increasing,

00:06:55.216 --> 00:06:57.316
starting in the 1990s.

00:06:57.710 --> 00:06:59.851
Coincidence? I think not.

00:06:59.875 --> 00:07:00.891
(Laughter)

00:07:00.915 --> 00:07:06.135
In fact, games are wired to produce
a particular kind of reaction in people.

00:07:06.159 --> 00:07:08.171
So we've got this learning brain increase,

00:07:08.195 --> 00:07:10.445
multitasking brain increase connection,

00:07:10.469 --> 00:07:13.756
and we also have a strong
dopamine loop in the brain.

00:07:13.780 --> 00:07:15.362
As games present a challenge,

00:07:15.386 --> 00:07:18.385
and you struggle to achieve that challenge
and you overcome it,

00:07:18.409 --> 00:07:20.099
dopamine is released in your brain.

00:07:20.123 --> 00:07:22.635
And that produces
an intrinsic reinforcement.

00:07:22.659 --> 00:07:26.166
In the words of Judy,
that produces an intrinsic reinforcement

00:07:26.190 --> 00:07:27.528
that causes you to go back

00:07:27.552 --> 00:07:31.255
and keep seeking that activity
over and over again.

00:07:31.279 --> 00:07:33.353
So this is really powerful stuff.

00:07:33.377 --> 00:07:38.273
I want to introduce you to an educator
who understands this in intricate detail,

00:07:38.297 --> 00:07:40.039
named Ananth Pai.

00:07:40.063 --> 00:07:42.939
Ananth was a very successful
businessperson

00:07:42.963 --> 00:07:45.159
who worked on process reengineering.

00:07:46.087 --> 00:07:49.797
When his kids went into school
in White Bear Lake, Minnesota,

00:07:49.821 --> 00:07:51.689
a suburb of Minneapolis-Saint Paul,

00:07:51.713 --> 00:07:53.070
he saw the education system

00:07:53.094 --> 00:07:55.341
and decided he wanted
to do something about it.

00:07:55.365 --> 00:07:58.337
So as an adult, he went back
and got a master's in [Education]

00:07:58.361 --> 00:08:01.162
and took over a class
at White Bear Lake Elementary School.

00:08:01.186 --> 00:08:03.973
Ananth Pai replaced
the standard curriculum

00:08:03.997 --> 00:08:06.871
with a video game based curriculum
of his own design,

00:08:06.895 --> 00:08:09.209
separating the kids into leaning styles

00:08:09.233 --> 00:08:12.178
and giving them Nintendo DS's
and computer games --

00:08:12.202 --> 00:08:14.428
everything off the shelf,
nothing custom --

00:08:14.452 --> 00:08:16.979
giving them Nintendo DS's
and computer games

00:08:17.003 --> 00:08:19.147
that were both individual
and social to play,

00:08:19.171 --> 00:08:21.418
that taught them math and language.

00:08:21.442 --> 00:08:23.257
Let me tell you what happened.

00:08:23.281 --> 00:08:27.020
In the space of 18 weeks,

00:08:27.044 --> 00:08:30.816
Mr. Pai's class went
from a below-3rd-grade level

00:08:30.840 --> 00:08:32.165
in reading and math

00:08:32.189 --> 00:08:35.711
to a mid-4th-grade level
in reading and math.

00:08:35.735 --> 00:08:39.037
In 18 weeks of a game-based curriculum.

00:08:39.061 --> 00:08:41.487
More importantly,
when you talk to the children,

00:08:41.511 --> 00:08:45.602
when they're interviewed on television,
even away from Mr. Pai,

00:08:45.626 --> 00:08:48.047
they say two things over and over again,

00:08:48.071 --> 00:08:50.137
that help them learn in his class:

00:08:50.161 --> 00:08:52.415
learning is fun,

00:08:52.439 --> 00:08:54.565
and learning is multiplayer.

00:08:55.186 --> 00:08:57.228
Whether they use those exact words or not,

00:08:57.252 --> 00:08:59.789
they say learning is fun
and learning is multiplayer.

00:08:59.813 --> 00:09:03.312
This is the key to making that experience
really successful for kids.

00:09:03.336 --> 00:09:05.928
It's also true, though,
that we need to talk about

00:09:05.952 --> 00:09:08.416
the relationship between kids
and violence in games.

00:09:08.440 --> 00:09:10.447
Study after study very clearly tells you

00:09:10.471 --> 00:09:13.056
that violent games
do not make children violent.

00:09:13.080 --> 00:09:14.828
We also must acknowledge, however,

00:09:14.852 --> 00:09:17.303
that if you have a child
predisposed to violence,

00:09:17.327 --> 00:09:20.549
violent games may help make them
a better violent child.

00:09:20.573 --> 00:09:23.920
If they train kids to do other things,
they also will train that,

00:09:23.944 --> 00:09:25.239
and we need to accept that,

00:09:25.263 --> 00:09:27.566
and we need to start
understanding the connection

00:09:27.590 --> 00:09:29.349
between games as a form of training.

00:09:29.373 --> 00:09:31.707
We can't blanket-say
that they don't affect kids.

00:09:31.731 --> 00:09:32.893
It's not true.

00:09:32.917 --> 00:09:36.778
I'd like to call the group of people
who are driving this trend forward

00:09:36.802 --> 00:09:37.961
"Generation G."

00:09:37.985 --> 00:09:42.113
There are 126 million millennials
in the United States and the EU,

00:09:42.137 --> 00:09:44.291
plus younger kids we can't yet count,

00:09:44.315 --> 00:09:45.776
that form Generation G.

00:09:45.800 --> 00:09:50.250
And the way that Generation G
is different from X, Y,

00:09:50.274 --> 00:09:52.983
and all the different generations
that we may belong to,

00:09:53.007 --> 00:09:55.910
is that video games
are the primary form of entertainment

00:09:55.934 --> 00:09:57.634
that Generation G is consuming.

00:09:57.658 --> 00:09:59.672
It is their primary form of entertainment.

00:09:59.696 --> 00:10:02.788
This is already starting to have
a tremendous effect on society.

00:10:02.812 --> 00:10:06.424
All around us, Generation G's desire
for game-like experiences

00:10:06.448 --> 00:10:08.033
is reshaping industries,

00:10:08.057 --> 00:10:12.866
from Foursquare, which caused the mobile
social networking ecosystem to start,

00:10:12.890 --> 00:10:18.411
to companies like Nike, Coke, Chase,
and also Kozinga,

00:10:18.435 --> 00:10:20.927
which owes much of its success to games.

00:10:20.951 --> 00:10:24.761
The trend that underlies this whole
pattern is called "gamification."

00:10:24.785 --> 00:10:27.179
It's a word that many of you,
I'm sure, have heard.

00:10:27.203 --> 00:10:31.333
A simple definition of gamification
is it's the process of using game thinking

00:10:31.357 --> 00:10:32.576
and game mechanics

00:10:32.600 --> 00:10:35.200
to engage audiences and solve problems.

00:10:35.224 --> 00:10:39.104
Part of the reason gamification has become
such an emergent topic right now

00:10:39.128 --> 00:10:42.668
is because of Generation G's effect
on culture and society already.

00:10:42.692 --> 00:10:44.265
Their expectations are different.

00:10:44.289 --> 00:10:46.824
Some examples of gamification
that you may have seen

00:10:46.848 --> 00:10:48.456
that are really fascinating to me

00:10:48.480 --> 00:10:50.990
are the emergence
of in-dash[board] games in cars.

00:10:51.014 --> 00:10:55.159
Today, if you buy a hybrid
or an electric vehicle,

00:10:55.183 --> 00:10:56.545
you'll almost certainly see

00:10:56.569 --> 00:10:59.373
the product of a hundred million
dollars' worth of tooling

00:10:59.397 --> 00:11:00.806
and research and development,

00:11:00.830 --> 00:11:03.209
in the form of a Tamagotchi-style game,

00:11:03.233 --> 00:11:07.381
in a dashboard designed to make you
a more ecological driver.

00:11:07.405 --> 00:11:10.426
Most of the game mechanics
are very simple:

00:11:10.450 --> 00:11:13.186
a plant grows as you drive
more ecologically

00:11:13.210 --> 00:11:14.652
and withers if you don't,

00:11:14.676 --> 00:11:16.694
like those virtual pets Tamagotchi.

00:11:16.718 --> 00:11:20.204
This is an example
of gamification at work.

00:11:20.228 --> 00:11:24.015
Another really interesting example
is a thing called "speed camera lottery,"

00:11:24.039 --> 00:11:28.220
designed by Kevin Richardson,
based in San Francisco, works for MTV.

00:11:28.244 --> 00:11:29.395
Awesome guy.

00:11:29.419 --> 00:11:31.513
This is the concept
in speed camera lottery:

00:11:31.537 --> 00:11:34.037
you know those speeding cameras
that you pass by,

00:11:34.061 --> 00:11:36.370
and they take your picture
and send you a ticket?

00:11:36.394 --> 00:11:37.872
In many Scandinavian countries,

00:11:37.896 --> 00:11:41.413
the ticket you get is actually based
not only on how fast you were going,

00:11:41.437 --> 00:11:44.779
but how much money you make:
the more you make, the bigger the ticket.

00:11:44.803 --> 00:11:47.633
Kevin reengineered
a speeding camera in Sweden

00:11:47.657 --> 00:11:49.352
that instead of just giving tickets

00:11:49.376 --> 00:11:52.405
to people who drive over the speed limit
that pass the camera,

00:11:52.429 --> 00:11:55.838
anybody who drives under the limit
is entered into a lottery

00:11:55.862 --> 00:11:58.212
to win the proceeds
of the people who speed.

00:11:58.236 --> 00:12:00.624
(Laughter)

00:12:00.648 --> 00:12:02.650
(Applause)

00:12:02.674 --> 00:12:06.334
It is game thinking --
that term I described earlier,

00:12:06.358 --> 00:12:08.197
the core foundation of gamification --

00:12:08.221 --> 00:12:10.951
in its purest and most beautiful form:

00:12:10.975 --> 00:12:13.067
take a big, negative reinforcement loop

00:12:13.091 --> 00:12:16.113
and turn it into small, incremental
positive reinforcement loop.

00:12:16.137 --> 00:12:20.537
It had the effect of dropping speed
by over 20% at that point of intervention.

00:12:20.561 --> 00:12:23.758
Corporations have also become aware
of the trend of gamification

00:12:23.782 --> 00:12:26.879
and the effect of games on people
like Generation G.

00:12:26.903 --> 00:12:28.846
Gartner Group says that by 2015,

00:12:28.870 --> 00:12:32.635
70% of all the Global 2000,
the biggest companies in the world,

00:12:32.659 --> 00:12:34.635
will be actively using gamification,

00:12:34.659 --> 00:12:37.347
and 50% of their process of innovation

00:12:37.371 --> 00:12:38.523
will be gamified,

00:12:38.547 --> 00:12:40.329
which is an astonishing thing.

00:12:40.353 --> 00:12:41.612
It's a huge change.

00:12:41.636 --> 00:12:45.236
What this all points to
is a future that looks pretty different

00:12:45.260 --> 00:12:47.033
from the world we live in today.

00:12:47.057 --> 00:12:50.467
Generation G and those driving
the gamification meme forward,

00:12:50.491 --> 00:12:52.779
are advocating for a different world.

00:12:52.803 --> 00:12:55.852
It's a world in which things
move at faster pace

00:12:55.876 --> 00:12:57.524
than they did for you and me.

00:12:57.548 --> 00:13:00.096
It's a world in which
there are rewards everywhere

00:13:00.120 --> 00:13:01.505
for actions that people take.

00:13:01.529 --> 00:13:03.865
The rewards don't always
have to be cash rewards.

00:13:03.889 --> 00:13:05.772
They can be meaningful status rewards,

00:13:05.796 --> 00:13:07.086
meaningful access rewards,

00:13:07.110 --> 00:13:09.175
meaningful power rewards.

00:13:09.199 --> 00:13:12.306
A world in which there's extensive
collaborative play.

00:13:12.330 --> 00:13:15.534
This is one of the things
that Generation G does so much differently

00:13:15.558 --> 00:13:16.720
than even my generation.

00:13:16.744 --> 00:13:20.893
I remember going to school and teachers
struggling to come up with exercises

00:13:20.917 --> 00:13:22.291
that we could do as a team,

00:13:22.315 --> 00:13:24.662
that would be graded as a team.

00:13:24.686 --> 00:13:28.463
In the end, those group exercises
always boiled down to an individual score,

00:13:28.487 --> 00:13:30.653
which distorted the way
that people behaved.

00:13:30.677 --> 00:13:33.127
But, Generation G plays a lot of games

00:13:33.151 --> 00:13:36.146
that are purely collaborative,
in which there is group value.

00:13:36.170 --> 00:13:38.626
This will also affect our world
in untold ways.

00:13:38.650 --> 00:13:42.790
And, Generation G, the fun future,
is a much more global world.

00:13:42.814 --> 00:13:46.778
It turns out that we are
already out of touch.

00:13:47.480 --> 00:13:52.983
We are the generation most out of touch
with our future or current children

00:13:53.007 --> 00:13:54.861
than any generation in history.

00:13:54.885 --> 00:13:59.000
We like to think that baby boomers'
parents were the most out-of-touch people

00:13:59.024 --> 00:14:00.187
in the world.

00:14:00.211 --> 00:14:02.858
They're the ones who had
to deal with the summer of love

00:14:02.882 --> 00:14:04.993
and sex and drugs
and all that kind of stuff.

00:14:05.017 --> 00:14:06.377
We still make phone calls.

00:14:06.401 --> 00:14:07.573
(Laughter)

00:14:07.597 --> 00:14:10.219
I mean, we are the ones with the problem,

00:14:10.243 --> 00:14:13.868
and we are going to be the most
out-of-touch generation in history.

00:14:13.892 --> 00:14:19.017
Of course, it's also true,
and I'm here to tell you:

00:14:19.041 --> 00:14:20.604
the kids are alright.

00:14:21.023 --> 00:14:23.096
They're going to be just fine.

00:14:23.120 --> 00:14:27.642
We don't need to worry, strictly speaking,

00:14:27.666 --> 00:14:31.049
about kids and games, and the effect
that it will have on the world.

00:14:31.073 --> 00:14:33.436
Not just are the kids
are going to be alright;

00:14:33.460 --> 00:14:35.808
frankly, the kids are going to be awesome.

00:14:36.316 --> 00:14:39.262
But it's going to take your help
to make the kids awesome.

00:14:39.286 --> 00:14:41.157
I have a prescription for you.

00:14:41.181 --> 00:14:47.161
This is the best prescription anybody
is ever going to write in your life.

00:14:47.185 --> 00:14:49.354
I'm going to write it for you right now,

00:14:49.378 --> 00:14:51.882
in your mind, I don't have an actual pad.

00:14:51.906 --> 00:14:54.257
Just for clarity, a disclaimer:
I'm not a doctor.

00:14:54.281 --> 00:14:55.814
(Laughter)

00:14:55.838 --> 00:14:58.925
I am, however, going to write
a prescription for you all.

00:14:58.949 --> 00:15:00.592
This is the prescription:

00:15:00.616 --> 00:15:02.878
if you have children
or you work with children,

00:15:02.902 --> 00:15:06.144
or you desire to work with children,
or you want to change he world,

00:15:06.168 --> 00:15:09.624
this is the absolute, positive best thing
that you can do with your time,

00:15:09.648 --> 00:15:13.677
from now until I see you in the retirement
home on the coast of Spain

00:15:13.701 --> 00:15:14.851
or in the virtual world,

00:15:14.875 --> 00:15:16.720
wherever you choose to retire,

00:15:16.744 --> 00:15:19.857
which is: get into the game
with your kids.

00:15:20.297 --> 00:15:23.815
Stop fighting the game trend,
if that's where you are right now.

00:15:23.839 --> 00:15:27.200
Don't fight the game trend.
Become one with the game.

00:15:27.224 --> 00:15:29.061
Enter the game. Understand it.

00:15:29.085 --> 00:15:31.860
Understand the dynamic
of how your children play

00:15:31.884 --> 00:15:33.500
the games that they play.

00:15:33.524 --> 00:15:37.723
Understand how their minds work
from the context of the game outward,

00:15:37.747 --> 00:15:40.570
rather than from the world outside inward.

00:15:40.594 --> 00:15:42.334
The world that we live in right now,

00:15:42.358 --> 00:15:45.716
the world of Sunday afternoons,
drinking a cup of herbal tea,

00:15:45.740 --> 00:15:49.279
reading some old book,
chilling out by the window,

00:15:49.303 --> 00:15:50.558
is over.

00:15:50.582 --> 00:15:52.394
(Laughter)

00:15:52.418 --> 00:15:53.680
And that's okay.

00:15:54.140 --> 00:15:57.850
There's a lot more things that we can do
that are fun and engaging.

00:15:57.874 --> 00:16:00.700
If you take away one thing
from today's presentation,

00:16:00.724 --> 00:16:03.729
I hope it is you get a chance
to go play with your kids.

00:16:03.753 --> 00:16:04.959
Thank you.

00:16:04.983 --> 00:16:06.423
(Applause)
