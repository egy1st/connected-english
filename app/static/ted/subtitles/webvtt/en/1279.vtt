00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:04.216
My mom is a strong black woman

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:07.520
who raised her kids to have
the same sense of strength and pride.

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:10.656
This spirit was epitomized
by a single wall

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:14.136
in our small, two-bedroom apartment
on the South Side of Chicago.

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:15.416
Two pictures hung proudly:

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:18.536
one larger-than-life photo
of my siblings and I

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:20.416
and the other a picture of my mom

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:21.656
at 12 years old

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:24.400
staring into the eyes
of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:28.816
When I was younger,
I used to stand on my tippy-toes,

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:30.096
stare at that picture,

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:32.695
close my eyes tightly,
and just pretend that it was me

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:36.536
gazing up at the man who revolutionized
the Civil Rights Movement,

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:39.336
who marched on Washington
and who transformed a generation

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:40.840
by his words, "I have a dream."

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.376
But I did get to meet him.

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:45.296
Now, obviously, I didn't meet Dr. King,

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:47.400
but I met a man named Dr. Vincent Harding.

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:49.976
He worked with Dr. King from day one

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.600
and even wrote some of his
most iconic speeches.

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:56.456
You see, this was a really
important moment for me as a kid,

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:58.616
because it was the first time
that I realized

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:01.136
that it wasn't just Dr. King
who led this revolution,

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:05.519
but he was surrounded by a movement
made up of anonymous extraordinaries.

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.216
Anonymous extraordinaries are people
who work selflessly and vigorously

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:12.496
for what they believe in,

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:15.696
people who are motivated by conviction
and not recognition.

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.856
It took me a long time to realize
the significance of this moment,

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:20.136
until I was much older.

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:22.016
And like I said, I grew up in Chicago.

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:24.096
I grew up in a rough, poor neighborhood,

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:26.096
but it didn't really matter to me as kid

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:29.216
because I literally have
the most incredible family in the world.

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:31.336
Two things that I did
struggle with a lot

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:32.576
growing up was one --

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:34.896
that my dad has been sick my whole life.

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.416
He suffers from Parkinson's
and pancreatitis,

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:40.736
and as a kid, it was so hard
for me to watch my hero

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:42.040
in so much pain.

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:44.976
And my other issue was with me.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.200
I guess you could say
I had an identity crisis.

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.736
I had to move four times
during high school,

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:53.056
and my freshman year I went
to an extremely racist high school.

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:54.456
Kids were so cruel.

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:56.136
They gave us hate letters,

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:57.976
wrote terrible things on our lockers

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.136
and because I'm biracial,
they would tell me,

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:02.816
"You can't be both.
You have to choose, black or white."

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:05.056
And in the end
I just resented being either.

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:07.936
And then all of a sudden,
my senior year rolls around, 2008,

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:10.936
and being mixed, being racially
ambiguous is this new cool fad,

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:14.176
like, "Natalie, now it's OK
for you to like you. You're pretty now."

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:17.416
I was over it. I was tired of caring
about what other people thought

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:19.056
and I just wanted to hurry up,

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:22.176
go through my classes,
whatever school I was going to be at next,

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:23.456
and graduate.

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:25.576
It wasn't until I was 17

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:27.696
and I saw a film
called "Invisible Children"

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:29.960
that something happened.

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:32.736
Child soldiers,

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:35.056
children as young as my nephews

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:39.216
being abducted,
given AK-47s and forced to kill,

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:42.296
not just anyone, but oftentimes
forced to kill their own parents,

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:44.096
their own siblings --

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:48.736
a rebel army committing mass murder
for no political or religious reason,

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:49.960
just because.

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:52.400
25 years.

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:55.896
25 years this conflict has been going on.

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:57.336
I'm 20 years old,

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:59.840
so that makes this conflict
five years older than me.

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:02.416
One man,

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:05.056
one man with one charismatic voice,

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:06.656
started this whole thing.

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:07.880
His name is Joseph Kony.

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:11.656
When I saw this film, something happened.

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:13.936
Something started
kind of stirring inside of me,

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:15.696
and I couldn't identify what it was.

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:17.856
I didn't know if it was rage,
if it was pity,

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:20.136
if I felt guilty
because this was the first time

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:21.840
I'd heard about a 25-year-long war.

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:24.416
I couldn't even give it a name.

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:27.186
All I knew is that it kicked me off my ass
and I started asking questions.

00:03:27.196 --> 00:03:30.816
What do I do? What can one 17-year-old do?

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:32.364
You've got to give me something.

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:34.166
And they gave me something.

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:37.496
The founders and filmmakers
at Invisible Children told me

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:38.776
that there was this bill,

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:40.816
that if we could
just get this bill passed,

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:43.616
it would do two things:
one, it would apprehend Joseph Kony

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:45.616
and the top commanders in his rebel army,

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:48.816
and two, it would provide funding
for the recovery of these regions

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:50.936
that had been devastated
by 25 years of war.

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:52.656
And I was like, done. Let me at it.

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:55.160
I swear I will do whatever I can
to make this happen.

00:03:55.800 --> 00:04:00.096
So myself and 99 other
idealistic 18- to 20-year-olds

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:03.200
hopped on a plane to intern
in San Diego with Invisible Children.

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:07.096
I was postponing college.
We weren't getting paid for this

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:10.296
and you could call it irresponsible
or crazy -- my parents did.

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:13.480
But for us, it would have been
insane not to go.

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:17.375
We all felt this urgency,
and we would do whatever it took

00:04:17.399 --> 00:04:19.120
to pass this bill.

00:04:19.839 --> 00:04:21.696
So we were given our first task.

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:25.496
We were going to plan an event called
the Rescue of Joseph Kony's Child Soldiers

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:28.656
where participants would come
in a hundred cities worldwide

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:30.136
and rally in their city center

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:32.256
until a celebrity or a political figure

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:35.176
came and used their voice
on behalf of these child soldiers,

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:37.400
and at that point each city was "rescued."

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:41.480
But the catch was, we weren't
leaving the cities until we were rescued.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.176
I was given Chicago and nine other cities

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:45.816
and I told my bosses, I was like,

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:49.296
"If we're going for big-name people,
why not go for the queen bee? Right?

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:50.776
Why not go for Oprah Winfrey?"

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:54.576
They thought I was a little idealistic,
but I mean, we were trying to think big.

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:56.256
We were doing an impossible thing,

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:58.496
so why not try to reach
more impossible things?

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:01.000
And so we had from January
to April to get this done.

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:05.496
This is the number of hours
that I spent on logistics,

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:07.896
from getting permits
to rallying participants

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:09.440
and finding venues.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.216
This is the number of times
that I was rejected

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:15.880
by celebrities' agents
or politicians' secretaries.

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:21.056
That is amount of money
that I spent personally

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:23.976
on Red Bull and Diet Coke
to stay awake during this movement.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:25.216
(Laughter)

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:26.800
You can judge me if you want to.

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:30.376
That is my hospital bill
from the kidney infection I got

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:33.816
from an overconsumption of caffeine
due to this event.

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:34.856
(Laughter)

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:37.576
These were just some
of the ridiculous things that we did

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:39.136
to try and pull this event off.

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:41.896
And so April 21 rolls around
and the event begins.

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:44.496
A hundred cities around the world.
They were beautiful.

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:47.816
Six days later, all the cities
were rescued but one:

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:49.416
Chicago.

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:51.816
So we were waiting in the city.

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:54.016
People started coming
from all over the world,

00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:55.993
all over the country to be reinforcements

00:05:56.017 --> 00:05:57.536
and join their voice with ours.

00:05:57.560 --> 00:05:58.816
And finally, on May 1,

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:01.136
we wrapped ourselves around Oprah's studio

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:02.656
and we got her attention.

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:05.336
This is a clip from a film
called "Together We Are Free"

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:08.240
documenting the rescue event
and my attempt to get Oprah.

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:13.016
(Video) Oprah Winfrey:
When I drove into the office,

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:16.136
there was a giant -- when you came in,
was there a group outside?

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:17.376
Crowd: Yes.

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:19.816
OW: Holding up signs
asking if I would talk to them

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:21.096
for just five minutes,

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:23.056
so I was happy to do so.

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:26.336
And they are with a group
called "Invisible Children,"

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:28.216
and I told this group outside

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:31.576
that I'd give them a minute
to state their case.

00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:34.376
Man: Oprah, thank you
so much for having us.

00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:40.056
Basically, these folks out here
have seen the story of 30,000 children

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:43.776
abducted by a rebel leader
named Joseph Kony.

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:45.496
And they're out here in solidarity,

00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:48.776
and they have been out here for six days.

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:51.656
This started 100,000 people worldwide.

00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:54.416
Now it's down to 500 standing strong

00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:56.896
so that you can raise
the profile of this issue

00:06:56.920 --> 00:07:01.136
and we can end the longest-running
war in Africa and rescue those kids

00:07:01.159 --> 00:07:03.695
that are child soldiers
still in East Africa.

00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:05.976
Oprah, I have to say
this girl Natalie here,

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:07.256
she's 18 years old.

00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:08.976
She was an intern for us this year,

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.736
and she said, "My one goal
is to get Oprah."

00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:14.456
She had 2,000 people come out on Saturday,

00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:15.696
but it rained.

00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:18.456
She stood here in the rain with 50 people.

00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:21.336
When they heard she was here,
hundreds started coming.

00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:23.376
People are here from Mexico, Australia.

00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:24.616
Natalie's 18.

00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:26.216
Don't think you're too young.

00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:27.976
You can change the world any day.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:29.216
Start now.

00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:30.456
Start today.

00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:32.960
(Cheers)

00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:37.176
Man: Was it worth it?

00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:39.680
Crowd: Yeah!

00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:45.816
Natalie! Natalie! Natalie!

00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:48.680
(Music)

00:07:51.640 --> 00:07:55.120
Together we are free!
Together we are free!

00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:04.536
(Applause)

00:08:04.560 --> 00:08:07.576
So you would think
that this is the moment in my life,

00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:10.040
the pinnacle that
made me an extraordinary.

00:08:10.920 --> 00:08:12.336
And it was an awesome moment.

00:08:12.360 --> 00:08:14.016
I mean, I was on top of the world.

00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:16.496
Ten million people
watched the "Oprah Winfrey Show."

00:08:16.520 --> 00:08:18.256
But looking back, that wasn't it.

00:08:18.280 --> 00:08:19.496
Don't get me wrong.

00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:21.136
Like I said, it was great moment.

00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:24.256
It made for a heck of a profile picture
on Facebook for a week.

00:08:24.280 --> 00:08:25.496
(Laughter)

00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:27.656
But I had been extraordinary all along,

00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:28.880
and I wasn't alone.

00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:32.135
You see, even though
my story was featured in this film,

00:08:32.159 --> 00:08:33.856
I was just one of a hundred interns

00:08:33.880 --> 00:08:36.559
who worked their tails off
to make this happen.

00:08:37.799 --> 00:08:39.015
I'm up in the air,

00:08:39.039 --> 00:08:41.216
but the guy that I'm sitting
on his shoulders,

00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:42.456
he's my best friend.

00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:43.856
His name is Johannes Oberman

00:08:43.880 --> 00:08:46.336
and Johannes worked with me
from day one in Chicago,

00:08:46.360 --> 00:08:49.160
just as long hours,
just as many sleepless nights as I did.

00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:52.696
The girl on the right,
her name's Bethany Bylsma.

00:08:52.720 --> 00:08:54.776
Bethany planned New York City and Boston,

00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:58.120
and they were seriously
the most beautiful events that we held.

00:08:58.640 --> 00:09:00.616
The girl on the left, her name's Colleen.

00:09:00.640 --> 00:09:02.696
Colleen moved to Mexico,

00:09:02.720 --> 00:09:04.256
moved, for three months,

00:09:04.280 --> 00:09:05.896
to plan five events there,

00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:08.216
only to be kicked out
the day before the events

00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:09.720
because of the swine flu.

00:09:10.880 --> 00:09:13.096
And then there was this family.

00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:15.536
This family, they didn't
get to come to the rescue.

00:09:15.560 --> 00:09:16.856
They couldn't make it out,

00:09:16.880 --> 00:09:19.216
but they ordered
a hundred boxes of pizza for us,

00:09:19.240 --> 00:09:22.056
delivered them to the corner
of Michigan and Randolph

00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:24.136
where we were all silently protesting.

00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:26.936
You see, it was people like this
doing whatever they could,

00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:29.136
simultaneously, single-mindedly,

00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:31.136
without a care to who was watching,

00:09:31.160 --> 00:09:32.856
that made this happen.

00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:34.816
It wasn't about us getting on Oprah,

00:09:34.840 --> 00:09:36.976
because when I got down
from their shoulders,

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:38.456
the war hadn't ended.

00:09:38.480 --> 00:09:39.736
It was about that bill.

00:09:39.760 --> 00:09:42.216
Oprah was just a checkpoint
on the way to that bill.

00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:43.496
That bill was the point.

00:09:43.520 --> 00:09:46.056
That bill is what we had
our eyes set on from day one.

00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:48.856
That was going to help us
end Africa's longest-running war.

00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:51.536
And that is what brought
a hundred thousand people

00:09:51.560 --> 00:09:53.720
out to the rescue event
from around the world.

00:09:55.120 --> 00:09:56.320
And it paid off:

00:09:57.560 --> 00:10:00.216
10 days after we were on Oprah,

00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:02.200
the bill was introduced into Congress.

00:10:02.840 --> 00:10:06.291
A year after that, it got unanimously

00:10:06.316 --> 00:10:09.856
267 cosponsors in Congress.

00:10:09.903 --> 00:10:11.292
And then one week after that,

00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:14.656
President Obama signed our bill into law.

00:10:14.680 --> 00:10:18.320
(Applause)

00:10:22.920 --> 00:10:25.056
And none of us interns got to be there.

00:10:25.080 --> 00:10:27.056
We didn't get to be there in this moment.

00:10:27.080 --> 00:10:28.296
Our founders were there.

00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:30.376
They're the guys
cheesing in the background.

00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:34.736
But that moment right there
is what made all of it worth it.

00:10:34.760 --> 00:10:38.096
It's what a hundred thousand
anonymous extraordinaries

00:10:38.120 --> 00:10:40.720
worked for so hard to make that happen.

00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:43.856
You know, the Oprah moments,

00:10:43.880 --> 00:10:46.976
they prove that the supposedly
impossible can be done.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.056
They inspire us.
They boost our confidence.

00:10:49.080 --> 00:10:51.376
But the moment isn't a movement.

00:10:51.400 --> 00:10:54.696
Even a lot of those moments
strung together don't fuel a movement.

00:10:54.720 --> 00:10:58.080
What fuels a movement are
the anonymous extraordinaries behind it.

00:10:58.960 --> 00:11:01.816
You know, for me, what kept me
pushing on through the rescue

00:11:01.840 --> 00:11:03.776
was the thought of those child soldiers.

00:11:03.800 --> 00:11:06.656
It became personal.
I was able to go to Africa at one point.

00:11:06.680 --> 00:11:08.136
I met these incredible people.

00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:11.536
I have friends that have been
living in this conflict their entire life,

00:11:11.560 --> 00:11:12.976
and it was personal to me.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.080
But that doesn't have to be
what drives you.

00:11:15.680 --> 00:11:18.816
You know, you may want
to be the next Shepard Fairey

00:11:18.840 --> 00:11:21.296
or the next JK Rowling

00:11:21.320 --> 00:11:22.616
or the next whoever.

00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:24.816
It doesn't matter, but whatever you want,

00:11:24.840 --> 00:11:27.416
chase after it
with everything that you have --

00:11:27.440 --> 00:11:29.336
not because of the fame or the fortune,

00:11:29.360 --> 00:11:31.536
but solely because
that's what you believe in,

00:11:31.560 --> 00:11:33.576
because that's what makes your heart sing.

00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:34.840
That's what your dance is.

00:11:36.360 --> 00:11:38.776
That's what is going
to define our generation,

00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:41.856
when we start chasing and fighting
after the things that we love

00:11:41.880 --> 00:11:43.336
and that we want to fight for.

00:11:43.360 --> 00:11:46.536
I cared too much in high school
about what people thought about me.

00:11:46.560 --> 00:11:48.696
That's what so awesome
about this conference,

00:11:48.720 --> 00:11:50.256
is so many of you are so young.

00:11:50.280 --> 00:11:53.756
Find that thing that inspires you
that you love, and just chase after it.

00:11:53.770 --> 00:11:54.976
You know, fight for that,

00:11:54.990 --> 00:11:57.336
because that is what
is going to change this world

00:11:57.360 --> 00:11:58.936
and that is what defines us.

00:11:58.960 --> 00:12:00.296
Despite what people think,

00:12:00.320 --> 00:12:03.976
my Oprah moments,
my being on TED, doesn't define me,

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.096
because if you were
to follow me home to LA,

00:12:06.120 --> 00:12:09.016
you would see me waiting tables
and nannying to pay the bills

00:12:09.040 --> 00:12:11.440
as I chase after my dream
of becoming a filmmaker.

00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:15.496
In the small, anonymous, monotonous

00:12:15.520 --> 00:12:17.256
every-single-day acts,

00:12:17.280 --> 00:12:20.000
I have to remind myself
to be extraordinary.

00:12:21.160 --> 00:12:24.456
And believe me, when the door
is closed and the cameras are off,

00:12:24.480 --> 00:12:26.136
it's tough.

00:12:26.160 --> 00:12:28.896
But if there's one thing
that I want to drive home to you,

00:12:28.920 --> 00:12:31.576
one thing that I can say,
not just to you but to myself,

00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:34.096
is that it is the acts
that make us extraordinary,

00:12:34.120 --> 00:12:36.400
not the Oprah moments. Thank you.
