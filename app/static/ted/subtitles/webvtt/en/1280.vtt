WEBVTT

00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.079
I want to talk to you about something

00:00:03.103 --> 00:00:04.341
kind of big.

00:00:06.682 --> 00:00:07.896
We'll start here.

00:00:09.577 --> 00:00:11.526
Sixty-five million years ago --

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:12.587
(Laughter)

00:00:12.611 --> 00:00:15.650
the dinosaurs had a bad day.

00:00:15.674 --> 00:00:18.285
(Laughter)

00:00:18.309 --> 00:00:21.584
A chunk of rock six miles across,

00:00:21.608 --> 00:00:25.349
moving something like 50 times
the speed of a rifle bullet,

00:00:25.373 --> 00:00:27.154
slammed into the Earth.

00:00:27.178 --> 00:00:29.634
It released its energy all at once,

00:00:29.658 --> 00:00:33.186
and it was an explosion
that was mind-numbing.

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:36.071
If you took every
nuclear weapon ever built

00:00:36.095 --> 00:00:37.654
at the height of the Cold War,

00:00:37.678 --> 00:00:39.050
lumped them together,

00:00:39.074 --> 00:00:41.576
and blew them up at the same time,

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:46.309
that would be one one-millionth
of the energy released at that moment.

00:00:46.996 --> 00:00:50.486
The dinosaurs had a really bad day.

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:51.675
OK?

00:00:51.699 --> 00:00:54.040
Now, a six-mile-wide rock is very large.

00:00:54.064 --> 00:00:55.429
We all live here in Boulder.

00:00:55.453 --> 00:00:57.853
If you look out your window
and see Longs Peak --

00:00:57.877 --> 00:00:59.592
you're probably familiar with it --

00:00:59.616 --> 00:01:02.629
now, scoop up Longs Peak
and put it out in space.

00:01:02.653 --> 00:01:05.338
Take ... Meeker, Mt. Meeker.

00:01:05.362 --> 00:01:08.099
Lump that in there,
and put that in space as well.

00:01:08.123 --> 00:01:11.151
And Mt. Everest. And K2.

00:01:11.175 --> 00:01:12.738
And the Indian peaks.

00:01:12.762 --> 00:01:16.626
Then you're starting to get an idea
of how much rock we're talking about, OK?

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:17.827
We know it was that big

00:01:17.851 --> 00:01:20.687
because of the impact it had
and the crater it left.

00:01:20.711 --> 00:01:24.676
It hit in what we now know
as Yucatan, the Gulf of Mexico.

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:27.310
You can see here,
there's the Yucatan Peninsula,

00:01:27.334 --> 00:01:29.707
if you recognize Cozumel
off the east coast there.

00:01:29.731 --> 00:01:32.447
Here is how big of a crater was left.

00:01:32.471 --> 00:01:33.644
It was huge.

00:01:33.668 --> 00:01:36.256
To give you a sense
of the scale ... there you go.

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:40.273
The scale here is 50 miles on top,
a hundred kilometers on the bottom.

00:01:40.297 --> 00:01:43.349
This thing was 300 kilometers
across -- 200 miles --

00:01:43.373 --> 00:01:46.950
an enormous crater that excavated
out vast amounts of earth

00:01:46.974 --> 00:01:51.545
that splashed around the globe
and set fires all over the planet,

00:01:51.569 --> 00:01:53.814
threw up enough dust to block out the sun.

00:01:53.838 --> 00:01:58.184
It wiped out 75 percent
of all species on Earth.

00:01:58.208 --> 00:02:01.096
Now, not all asteroids are that big.

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:02.445
Some of them are smaller.

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:06.209
Here is one that came in

00:02:06.233 --> 00:02:10.588
over the United States in October of 1992.

00:02:10.612 --> 00:02:12.348
It came in on a Friday night.

00:02:12.372 --> 00:02:13.628
Why is that important?

00:02:13.652 --> 00:02:17.424
Because back then, video cameras
were just starting to become popular,

00:02:17.448 --> 00:02:21.400
and parents would bring them
to their kids' football games

00:02:21.424 --> 00:02:23.247
to film their kids playing football.

00:02:23.271 --> 00:02:25.398
And since this came in on a Friday,

00:02:25.422 --> 00:02:28.863
they were able to get this great footage
of this thing breaking up

00:02:28.887 --> 00:02:32.342
as it came in over West Virginia,
Maryland, Pennsylvania and New Jersey

00:02:32.366 --> 00:02:33.676
until it did that

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:35.130
to a car in New York.

00:02:35.154 --> 00:02:36.730
(Laughter)

00:02:36.754 --> 00:02:40.252
Now, this is not a 200-mile-wide crater,

00:02:40.276 --> 00:02:43.757
but then again, you can see the rock,
which is sitting right here,

00:02:43.781 --> 00:02:45.175
about the size of a football,

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:47.581
that hit that car and did that damage.

00:02:47.605 --> 00:02:50.416
Now, this thing was probably
about the size of a school bus

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:51.597
when it first came in.

00:02:51.621 --> 00:02:53.598
It broke up through atmospheric pressure,

00:02:53.622 --> 00:02:55.721
it crumbled, and then
the pieces fell apart

00:02:55.745 --> 00:02:57.229
and did some damage.

00:02:57.253 --> 00:03:01.179
Now, you wouldn't want that falling
on your foot or your head,

00:03:01.203 --> 00:03:02.699
because it would do that to it.

00:03:02.723 --> 00:03:04.676
That would be bad.

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:07.964
But it won't wipe out, you know,
all life on Earth, so that's fine.

00:03:07.988 --> 00:03:11.676
But it turns out, you don't need
something six miles across

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:12.943
to do a lot of damage.

00:03:12.967 --> 00:03:16.662
There is a median point
between tiny rock and gigantic rock,

00:03:16.686 --> 00:03:20.554
and in fact, if any of you
have ever been to near Winslow, Arizona,

00:03:20.578 --> 00:03:24.097
there is a crater in the desert
there that is so iconic

00:03:24.121 --> 00:03:26.681
that it is actually
called "Meteor Crater."

00:03:26.705 --> 00:03:29.682
To give you a sense of scale,
this is about a mile wide.

00:03:29.706 --> 00:03:32.945
If you look up at the top,
that's a parking lot,

00:03:32.969 --> 00:03:35.863
and those are recreational
vehicles right there.

00:03:35.887 --> 00:03:38.961
So it's about a mile across,
600 feet deep.

00:03:38.985 --> 00:03:44.410
The object that formed this
was probably about 30 to 50 yards across,

00:03:44.434 --> 00:03:48.128
so roughly the size
of Macky Auditorium here.

00:03:48.152 --> 00:03:50.731
It came in at speeds that were tremendous,

00:03:50.755 --> 00:03:53.079
slammed into the ground, blew up,

00:03:53.103 --> 00:03:56.896
and exploded with the energy of roughly
a 20-megaton nuclear bomb --

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:58.487
a very hefty bomb.

00:03:58.511 --> 00:04:00.621
This was 50,000 years ago,

00:04:00.645 --> 00:04:03.515
so it may have wiped out
a few buffalo or antelope,

00:04:03.539 --> 00:04:06.097
or something like that out in the desert,

00:04:06.121 --> 00:04:09.922
but it probably would not have caused
global devastation.

00:04:09.946 --> 00:04:13.569
It turns out that these things
don't have to hit the ground

00:04:13.593 --> 00:04:15.176
to do a lot of damage.

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:19.057
Now, in 1908, over Siberia,
near the Tunguska region --

00:04:19.081 --> 00:04:22.262
for those of you who are Dan Aykroyd fans
and saw "Ghostbusters,"

00:04:22.286 --> 00:04:24.922
when he talked about the greatest
cross-dimensional rift

00:04:24.946 --> 00:04:26.880
since the Siberia blast of 1909,

00:04:26.904 --> 00:04:29.513
where he got the date
wrong, but that's OK.

00:04:29.537 --> 00:04:30.649
(Laughter)

00:04:30.673 --> 00:04:32.940
It was 1908. That's fine.
I can live with that.

00:04:32.964 --> 00:04:34.797
(Laughter)

00:04:34.821 --> 00:04:37.896
Another rock came
into the Earth's atmosphere

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:40.112
and this one blew up above the ground,

00:04:40.136 --> 00:04:42.449
several miles up
above the surface of the Earth.

00:04:42.473 --> 00:04:47.649
The heat from the explosion
set fire to the forest below it,

00:04:47.673 --> 00:04:50.850
and then the shock wave came down
and knocked down trees

00:04:50.874 --> 00:04:53.692
for hundreds of square miles.

00:04:53.716 --> 00:04:55.693
This did a huge amount of damage.

00:04:55.717 --> 00:04:58.462
And again, this was a rock
probably roughly the size

00:04:58.486 --> 00:05:00.564
of this auditorium that we're sitting in.

00:05:00.588 --> 00:05:02.565
In Meteor Crater, it was made of metal,

00:05:02.589 --> 00:05:05.233
and metal is much tougher,
so it made it to the ground.

00:05:05.257 --> 00:05:07.564
The one over Tunguska
was probably made of rock,

00:05:07.588 --> 00:05:10.382
and that's much more crumbly,
so it blew up in the air.

00:05:10.406 --> 00:05:15.091
Either way, these are tremendous
explosions -- 20 megatons.

00:05:15.115 --> 00:05:17.164
Now, when these things blow up,

00:05:17.188 --> 00:05:20.575
they're not going to do
global ecological damage.

00:05:20.599 --> 00:05:23.767
They're not going to do
something like the dinosaur killer did.

00:05:23.791 --> 00:05:25.260
They're just not big enough.

00:05:25.284 --> 00:05:27.970
But they will do global economic damage,

00:05:27.994 --> 00:05:30.512
because they don't have
to hit, necessarily,

00:05:30.536 --> 00:05:32.045
to do this kind of damage.

00:05:32.069 --> 00:05:34.676
They don't have to do global devastation.

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:37.512
If one of these things were to hit
pretty much anywhere,

00:05:37.536 --> 00:05:38.691
it would cause a panic.

00:05:38.715 --> 00:05:40.980
But if it came over a city,
an important city --

00:05:41.004 --> 00:05:43.268
not that any city
is more important than others,

00:05:43.292 --> 00:05:46.631
but some of them we depend on more
on the global economic basis --

00:05:46.655 --> 00:05:51.861
that could do a huge amount of damage
to us as a civilization.

00:05:51.885 --> 00:05:55.407
So, now that I've scared
the crap out of you --

00:05:55.431 --> 00:05:56.536
(Laughter)

00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:58.537
what can we do about this?

00:05:58.561 --> 00:06:00.648
This is a potential threat.

00:06:00.672 --> 00:06:05.058
Let me note that we have not had
a giant impact like the dinosaur killer

00:06:05.082 --> 00:06:06.369
for 65 million years.

00:06:06.393 --> 00:06:07.730
They're very rare.

00:06:07.754 --> 00:06:09.873
The smaller ones happen more often,

00:06:09.897 --> 00:06:12.424
but probably on the order of a millennium,

00:06:12.448 --> 00:06:15.824
every few centuries
or every few thousand years.

00:06:15.848 --> 00:06:17.900
But it's still something to be aware of.

00:06:17.924 --> 00:06:19.464
Well, what do we do about them?

00:06:19.488 --> 00:06:21.595
The first thing
we have to do is find them.

00:06:21.619 --> 00:06:25.861
This is an image of an asteroid
that passed us in 2009.

00:06:25.885 --> 00:06:27.682
It's right here.

00:06:27.706 --> 00:06:30.177
But you can see that it's extremely faint.

00:06:30.201 --> 00:06:32.534
I don't know if you can see that
in the back row.

00:06:32.558 --> 00:06:33.973
These are just stars.

00:06:33.997 --> 00:06:36.230
This is a rock
that was about 30 yards across,

00:06:36.254 --> 00:06:39.133
so roughly the size of the ones
that blew up over Tunguska

00:06:39.157 --> 00:06:41.383
and hit Arizona 50,000 years ago.

00:06:41.407 --> 00:06:42.569
These things are faint.

00:06:42.593 --> 00:06:45.019
They're hard to see,
and the sky is really big.

00:06:45.043 --> 00:06:46.963
We have to find these things first.

00:06:46.987 --> 00:06:49.266
Well, the good news is,
we're looking for them.

00:06:49.290 --> 00:06:51.583
NASA has devoted money to this;

00:06:51.607 --> 00:06:54.008
the National Science Foundation
and other countries

00:06:54.032 --> 00:06:55.447
are interested in doing this.

00:06:55.471 --> 00:06:58.224
We're building telescopes
that are looking for the threat.

00:06:58.248 --> 00:07:00.814
That's a great first step.
But what's the second step?

00:07:00.838 --> 00:07:04.286
The second step is if we see one heading
toward us, we have to stop it.

00:07:04.310 --> 00:07:05.461
What do we do?

00:07:05.485 --> 00:07:07.837
You've probably heard
about the asteroid Apophis.

00:07:07.861 --> 00:07:10.001
If you haven't yet, you will.

00:07:10.025 --> 00:07:12.690
If you've heard about the Mayan
2012 apocalypse,

00:07:12.714 --> 00:07:14.406
you're going to hear about Apophis,

00:07:14.430 --> 00:07:17.723
because you're keyed in
to all the doomsday networks, anyway.

00:07:17.747 --> 00:07:19.455
(Laughter)

00:07:19.479 --> 00:07:22.501
Apophis is an asteroid
that was discovered in 2004.

00:07:22.525 --> 00:07:26.257
It's roughly 250 [meters] across,
so it's pretty big --

00:07:26.281 --> 00:07:28.590
bigger than a football stadium.

00:07:28.614 --> 00:07:32.110
And it's going to pass
by the Earth in April of 2029.

00:07:32.134 --> 00:07:33.855
And it's going to pass us so close

00:07:33.879 --> 00:07:37.594
that it's actually going to come
underneath our weather satellites.

00:07:37.618 --> 00:07:41.317
The Earth's gravity is going to bend
the orbit of this thing so much

00:07:41.341 --> 00:07:42.743
that if it's just right,

00:07:42.767 --> 00:07:45.228
if it passes through this region of space,

00:07:45.252 --> 00:07:48.709
this kidney-bean-shaped region
called the keyhole,

00:07:48.733 --> 00:07:52.233
the Earth's gravity will bend it
just enough that seven years later,

00:07:52.257 --> 00:07:56.254
on April 13 -- which is a Friday,
I'll note -- in the year 2036 --

00:07:56.278 --> 00:07:57.301
(Laughter)

00:07:57.325 --> 00:07:59.065
you can't plan that kind of stuff --

00:07:59.089 --> 00:08:00.151
(Laughter)

00:08:00.175 --> 00:08:01.653
Apophis is going to hit us.

00:08:01.677 --> 00:08:06.036
And it's 250 meters across,
so it would do unbelievable damage.

00:08:06.060 --> 00:08:09.657
The good news is that the odds of it
actually passing through this keyhole

00:08:09.681 --> 00:08:12.652
and hitting us next go-around
are one in a million, roughly --

00:08:12.676 --> 00:08:13.827
very, very low odds.

00:08:13.851 --> 00:08:17.257
So I personally am not lying awake
at night worrying about this at all.

00:08:17.281 --> 00:08:18.975
I don't think Apophis is a problem.

00:08:18.999 --> 00:08:21.267
In fact, Apophis
is a blessing in disguise,

00:08:21.291 --> 00:08:23.876
because it woke us up
to the dangers of these things.

00:08:23.900 --> 00:08:26.077
This thing was discovered
just a few years ago

00:08:26.101 --> 00:08:27.944
and could hit us a few years from now.

00:08:27.968 --> 00:08:31.582
It won't, but it gives us a chance
to study these kinds of asteroids.

00:08:31.606 --> 00:08:35.112
We didn't really necessarily understand
these keyholes, and now we do,

00:08:35.136 --> 00:08:37.280
and it turns out that's really important,

00:08:37.304 --> 00:08:39.782
because how do you stop
an asteroid like this?

00:08:39.806 --> 00:08:41.328
Well, let me ask you:

00:08:41.352 --> 00:08:44.774
What happens if you're standing
in the road and a car's headed for you?

00:08:44.798 --> 00:08:45.968
What do you do?

00:08:45.992 --> 00:08:48.446
You do this. Right?
Move, and the car goes past you.

00:08:48.470 --> 00:08:50.790
But we can't move the Earth,
at least not easily,

00:08:50.814 --> 00:08:52.528
but we can move a small asteroid.

00:08:52.552 --> 00:08:54.747
And it turns out, we've even done it.

00:08:54.771 --> 00:08:58.732
In the year 2005, NASA launched
a probe called Deep Impact,

00:08:58.756 --> 00:09:03.217
which slammed a piece of itself
into the nucleus of a comet.

00:09:03.241 --> 00:09:05.110
Comets are very much like asteroids.

00:09:05.134 --> 00:09:07.253
The purpose wasn't to push it
out of the way;

00:09:07.277 --> 00:09:10.412
the purpose was to make a crater
to excavate the material

00:09:10.436 --> 00:09:12.991
and see what was underneath
the surface of this comet,

00:09:13.015 --> 00:09:14.711
which we learned quite a bit about.

00:09:14.735 --> 00:09:17.014
We did move the comet a little tiny bit --

00:09:17.038 --> 00:09:19.015
not very much, but that wasn't the point.

00:09:19.039 --> 00:09:20.876
However, think about this:

00:09:20.900 --> 00:09:25.252
This thing is orbiting the Sun
at 10, 20 miles per second.

00:09:25.276 --> 00:09:27.975
We shot a space probe
at it and hit it, OK?

00:09:27.999 --> 00:09:30.630
Imagine how hard that must be,
and we did it.

00:09:30.654 --> 00:09:32.457
That means we can do it again.

00:09:32.481 --> 00:09:36.620
If we see an asteroid that's coming
toward us, headed right for us,

00:09:36.644 --> 00:09:38.326
and we have two years to go?

00:09:38.350 --> 00:09:39.696
Boom! We hit it.

00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:42.243
You know, if you watch the movies --

00:09:42.267 --> 00:09:43.325
(Laughter)

00:09:43.349 --> 00:09:44.501
you might think:

00:09:44.525 --> 00:09:46.162
Why don't we use a nuclear weapon?

00:09:46.186 --> 00:09:48.539
Well, you can try that,
but the problem is timing.

00:09:48.563 --> 00:09:50.353
Shoot a nuclear weapon at this thing,

00:09:50.377 --> 00:09:53.309
you have to blow it up
within a few milliseconds of tolerance,

00:09:53.333 --> 00:09:54.509
or else you'll miss it.

00:09:54.533 --> 00:09:57.834
And there are a lot of other problems
with that; it's very hard to do.

00:09:57.858 --> 00:10:00.061
But just hitting something?
That's pretty easy.

00:10:00.085 --> 00:10:02.723
I think even NASA can do that,
and proved that they can.

00:10:02.747 --> 00:10:03.756
(Laughter)

00:10:03.780 --> 00:10:07.209
The problem is, if you hit this asteroid,
you've changed the orbit,

00:10:07.233 --> 00:10:08.385
you measure the orbit,

00:10:08.409 --> 00:10:11.336
then you find out, oh yeah,
we just pushed it into a keyhole,

00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:13.437
and now it's going to hit us
in three years.

00:10:13.461 --> 00:10:15.589
Well, my opinion is: fine!

00:10:15.613 --> 00:10:17.482
It's not hitting us in six months --

00:10:17.506 --> 00:10:18.668
that's good.

00:10:18.692 --> 00:10:21.460
Now we have three years
to do something else.

00:10:21.484 --> 00:10:22.852
And you can hit it again.

00:10:22.876 --> 00:10:24.186
That's kind of ham-fisted;

00:10:24.210 --> 00:10:26.879
you might just push it
into a third keyhole or whatever,

00:10:26.903 --> 00:10:28.076
so you don't do that.

00:10:28.100 --> 00:10:29.271
And this is the part --

00:10:29.766 --> 00:10:31.066
it's the part I just love.

00:10:31.090 --> 00:10:33.705
(Laughter)

00:10:33.729 --> 00:10:38.187
After the big macho "Grr ... bam!
We're gonna hit this thing in the face,"

00:10:38.211 --> 00:10:41.009
then we bring in the velvet gloves.

00:10:41.033 --> 00:10:42.876
(Laughter)

00:10:42.900 --> 00:10:45.789
There's a group of scientists
and engineers and astronauts,

00:10:45.813 --> 00:10:48.246
and they call themselves
The B612 Foundation.

00:10:48.270 --> 00:10:50.616
For those of you who've read
"The Little Prince,"

00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:52.608
you understand that reference, I hope --

00:10:52.632 --> 00:10:55.087
the little prince lived
on an asteroid called B612.

00:10:55.111 --> 00:10:58.823
These are smart guys -- men and women --
astronauts, like I said, engineers.

00:10:58.847 --> 00:11:02.107
Rusty Schweickart, who was an Apollo 9
astronaut, is on this.

00:11:02.131 --> 00:11:04.250
Dan Durda, my friend who made this image,

00:11:04.274 --> 00:11:08.181
works here at Southwest Research Institute
in Boulder, on Walnut Street.

00:11:08.205 --> 00:11:09.740
He created this image for this.

00:11:09.764 --> 00:11:12.418
He's actually one of the astronomers
who works for them.

00:11:12.442 --> 00:11:15.045
If we see an asteroid
that's going to hit the Earth

00:11:15.069 --> 00:11:16.782
and we have enough time,

00:11:16.806 --> 00:11:19.161
we can hit it to move it
into a better orbit.

00:11:19.185 --> 00:11:23.986
But then what we do is launch a probe
that has to weigh a ton or two.

00:11:24.010 --> 00:11:26.996
It doesn't have to be huge --
a couple of tons, not that big --

00:11:27.020 --> 00:11:28.733
and you park it near the asteroid.

00:11:28.757 --> 00:11:32.088
You don't land on it, because these things
are tumbling end over end.

00:11:32.112 --> 00:11:33.708
It's very hard to land on them.

00:11:33.732 --> 00:11:34.894
Instead you get near it.

00:11:34.918 --> 00:11:37.142
The gravity of the asteroid
pulls on the probe,

00:11:37.166 --> 00:11:39.190
and the probe
has a couple of tons of mass.

00:11:39.214 --> 00:11:40.947
It has a little tiny bit of gravity,

00:11:40.971 --> 00:11:44.200
but it's enough
that it can pull the asteroid,

00:11:44.224 --> 00:11:45.849
and you have your rocket set up --

00:11:45.873 --> 00:11:48.742
you can barely see it here,
but there's rocket plumes --

00:11:48.766 --> 00:11:52.140
and these guys are connected
by their own gravity,

00:11:52.164 --> 00:11:55.712
and if you move the probe
very slowly -- very, very gently,

00:11:55.736 --> 00:12:00.759
you can very easily finesse that rock
into a safe orbit.

00:12:00.783 --> 00:12:03.908
You can even put in orbit
around the Earth where we could mine it,

00:12:03.932 --> 00:12:06.726
although that's a whole other thing;
I won't go into that.

00:12:06.750 --> 00:12:07.777
(Laughter)

00:12:07.801 --> 00:12:09.553
But we'd be rich!

00:12:09.577 --> 00:12:15.011
(Laughter)

00:12:15.035 --> 00:12:17.059
So think about this, right?

00:12:17.745 --> 00:12:21.033
There are these giant rocks flying
out there, and they're hitting us,

00:12:21.057 --> 00:12:22.579
and they're doing damage to us.

00:12:22.603 --> 00:12:24.412
But we've figured out how to do this,

00:12:24.436 --> 00:12:26.653
and all the pieces
are in place to do this.

00:12:26.677 --> 00:12:29.878
We have astronomers
with telescopes, looking for them.

00:12:29.902 --> 00:12:32.173
We have very, very smart people,

00:12:32.197 --> 00:12:35.589
who are concerned about this
and figuring out how to fix the problem,

00:12:35.613 --> 00:12:37.445
and we have the technology to do this.

00:12:37.469 --> 00:12:39.671
This probe actually can't use
chemical rockets.

00:12:39.695 --> 00:12:42.353
Chemical rockets provide
too much thrust, too much push.

00:12:42.377 --> 00:12:43.939
The probe would just shoot away.

00:12:43.963 --> 00:12:46.014
We invented something called an ion drive,

00:12:46.038 --> 00:12:48.592
which is a very, very,
very low-thrust engine.

00:12:48.616 --> 00:12:51.925
It generates the force a piece of paper
would have on your hand --

00:12:51.949 --> 00:12:55.913
incredibly light, but it can run
for months and years,

00:12:55.937 --> 00:12:58.267
providing that very gentle push.

00:12:58.291 --> 00:13:00.880
If anybody here is a fan
of the original "Star Trek,"

00:13:00.904 --> 00:13:03.699
they ran across an alien ship
that had an ion drive,

00:13:03.723 --> 00:13:06.415
and Spock said, "They're very
technically sophisticated.

00:13:06.439 --> 00:13:08.940
They're a hundred years
ahead of us with this drive."

00:13:08.964 --> 00:13:10.510
Yeah, we have an ion drive now.

00:13:10.534 --> 00:13:13.516
We don't have the Enterprise,
but we've got an ion drive now.

00:13:13.540 --> 00:13:15.486
(Laughter)

00:13:15.510 --> 00:13:17.626
(Applause)

00:13:17.650 --> 00:13:18.876
Spock.

00:13:18.900 --> 00:13:21.032
(Laughter)

00:13:21.056 --> 00:13:22.253
So ...

00:13:23.788 --> 00:13:25.432
That's the difference --

00:13:25.456 --> 00:13:28.393
that's the difference
between us and the dinosaurs.

00:13:28.417 --> 00:13:29.859
This happened to them.

00:13:30.638 --> 00:13:32.453
It doesn't have to happen to us.

00:13:32.477 --> 00:13:35.635
The difference
between the dinosaurs and us

00:13:35.659 --> 00:13:37.774
is that we have a space program

00:13:37.798 --> 00:13:39.520
and we can vote,

00:13:39.544 --> 00:13:41.876
and so we can change our future.

00:13:41.900 --> 00:13:43.537
(Laughter)

00:13:43.561 --> 00:13:45.653
We have the ability to change our future.

00:13:45.677 --> 00:13:47.654
Sixty-five million years from now,

00:13:47.678 --> 00:13:51.582
we don't have to have our bones
collecting dust in a museum.

00:13:51.606 --> 00:13:52.774
Thank you very much.

00:13:52.798 --> 00:13:55.804
(Applause)
