00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Let me introduce to you Rezero.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
This little fellow was developed

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
by a group of 10 undergraduate students

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
at the Autonomous Systems Laboratory

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
at ETH-Zurich.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Our robot belongs to a family of robots

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
called Ballbots.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Instead of wheels, a Ballbot is balancing

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
and moving on one single ball.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
The main characteristics of such a system is

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
that there's one sole contact point to the ground.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
This means that the robot

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
is inherently unstable.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
It's like when I am trying to stand

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:32.000
on one foot.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
You might ask yourself, what's the usefulness

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
of a robot that's unstable?

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Now we'll explain that in a second.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Let me first explain how Rezero

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
actually keeps his balance.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
Rezero keeps his balance by constantly

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
measuring his pitch angle with a sensor.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
He then counteracts and avoids toppling over

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
by turning the motors appropriately.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
This happens 160 times per second,

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
and if anything fails in this process,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
Rezero would immediately fall to the ground.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
Now to move and to balance,

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
Rezero needs to turn the ball.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
The ball is driven by three special wheels

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
that allow Rezero to move into any direction

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
and also move around his own axis

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.000
at the same time.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
Due to his instability, Rezero is always

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
in motion. Now here's the trick.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
It's indeed exactly this instability that allows

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
a robot to move very [dynamically].

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
Let's play a little.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
You may have wondered what happens

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
if I give the robot a little push.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
In this mode, he's trying to maintain

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
his position.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
For the next demo, I'd like you to introduce

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
to my colleagues Michael, on the computer,

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
and Thomas who's helping me onstage.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
In the next mode, Rezero is passive,

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000
and we can move him around.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
With almost no force I can control

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
his position and his velocity.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
I can also make him spin.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
In the next mode, we can get Rezero

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000
to follow a person.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000
He's now keeping a constant distance to Thomas.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
This works with a laser sensor

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
that's mounted on top of Rezero.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
With the same method, we can also

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000
get him to circle a person.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.000
We call this the orbiting mode.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
All right, thank you, Thomas.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.000
(Applause)

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000
Now, what's the use of this technology?

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
For now, it's an experiment, but let me

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000
show you some possible future applications.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
Rezero could be used in exhibitions or parks.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
With a screen it could inform people or show

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000
them around in a fun and entertaining way.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000
In a hospital, this device could be used to

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
carry around medical equipment.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
Due to the Ballbot system, it has a very small

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.000
footprint and it's also easy to move around.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
And of course, who wouldn't like

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.000
to take a ride on one of these.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000
And these are more practical applications.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000
But there's also a certain beauty

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000
within this technology.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:49.000
(Music)

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:44.000
(Applause)

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000
Thank you.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:50.000
(Applause)

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
Thank you.
