00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Ladies and gentlemen, gather around.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
I would love to share with you a story.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Once upon a time

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
in 19th century Germany,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
there was the book.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Now during this time,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
the book was the king of storytelling.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
It was venerable.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
It was ubiquitous.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
But it was a little bit boring.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Because in its 400 years of existence,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
storytellers never evolved the book

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
as a storytelling device.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
But then one author arrived,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
and he changed the game forever.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
(Music)

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
His name was Lothar,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
Lothar Meggendorfer.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
Lothar Meggendorfer put his foot down,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
and he said, "Genug ist genug!"

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
He grabbed his pen,

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
he snatched his scissors.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
This man refused to fold to the conventions of normalcy

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
and just decided to fold.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
History would know Lothar Meggendorfer

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
as -- who else? --

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
the world's first true inventor

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
of the children's pop-up book.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
(Music)

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
For this delight and for this wonder,

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
people rejoiced.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
(Cheering)

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
They were happy because the story survived,

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
and that the world would keep on spinning.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
Lothar Meggendorfer wasn't the first

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
to evolve the way a story was told,

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
and he certainly wasn't the last.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
Whether storytellers realized it or not,

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
they were channeling Meggendorfer's spirit

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.000
when they moved opera to vaudville,

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
radio news to radio theater,

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
film to film in motion

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
to film in sound, color, 3D,

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
on VHS and on DVD.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000
There seemed to be no cure for this Meggendorferitis.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
And things got a lot more fun when the Internet came around.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
(Laughter)

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
Because, not only could people broadcast their stories throughout the world,

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
but they could do so

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
using what seemed to be an infinite amount of devices.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000
For example, one company

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
would tell a story of love

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
through its very own search engine.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
One Taiwanese production studio

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000
would interpret American politics in 3D.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:25.000
(Laughter)

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.000
And one man would tell the stories of his father

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
by using a platform called Twitter

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000
to communicate the excrement his father would gesticulate.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
And after all this, everyone paused;

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
they took a step back.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000
They realized that, in 6,000 years of storytelling,

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.000
they've gone from depicting hunting on cave walls

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.000
to depicting Shakespeare on Facebook walls.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000
And this was a cause for celebration.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
The art of storytelling has remained unchanged.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
And for the most part, the stories are recycled.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
But the way that humans tell the stories

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
has always evolved

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000
with pure, consistent novelty.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
And they remembered a man,

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
one amazing German,

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.000
every time a new storytelling device

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
popped up next.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
And for that,

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
the audience --

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
the lovely, beautiful audience --

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000
would live happily ever after.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:29.000
(Applause)
