00:00:00.833 --> 00:00:04.611
When I graduated UCLA,
I moved to Northern California,

00:00:04.635 --> 00:00:08.146
and I lived in a little town called Elk,
on the Mendocino coast.

00:00:08.733 --> 00:00:13.167
And I didn't have a phone or TV,
but I had US mail.

00:00:13.191 --> 00:00:16.561
And life was good back then --
if you could remember it.

00:00:17.693 --> 00:00:21.605
I'd go to the general store
for a cup of coffee and a brownie,

00:00:21.629 --> 00:00:23.870
I'd ship my film to San Francisco,

00:00:23.894 --> 00:00:27.411
and lo and behold, two days later,

00:00:27.435 --> 00:00:29.034
it would end up on my front door,

00:00:29.058 --> 00:00:33.298
which was way better than having
to fight the traffic of Hollywood.

00:00:33.925 --> 00:00:35.593
I didn't have much money,

00:00:35.617 --> 00:00:37.858
(Music)

00:00:37.882 --> 00:00:40.700
but I had time and a sense of wonder.

00:00:40.724 --> 00:00:43.588
So I started shooting
time-lapse photography.

00:00:43.987 --> 00:00:48.047
It would take me a month to shoot
a four-minute roll of film,

00:00:48.071 --> 00:00:49.874
because that's all I could afford.

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:54.811
I've been shooting time-lapse
flowers continuously, nonstop,

00:00:54.835 --> 00:00:56.624
24 hours a day, seven days a week,

00:00:56.648 --> 00:00:58.511
for over 30 years.

00:00:58.535 --> 00:01:02.258
And to see them move
is a dance I'll never get tired of.

00:01:03.417 --> 00:01:08.174
Their beauty immerses us
with color, taste, touch.

00:01:08.198 --> 00:01:11.009
It also provides a third
of the food we eat.

00:01:11.033 --> 00:01:14.109
(Music)

00:01:14.133 --> 00:01:17.965
Beauty and seduction
are nature's tools for survival,

00:01:17.989 --> 00:01:20.301
because we protect
what we fall in love with.

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:22.272
It opens our hearts

00:01:22.296 --> 00:01:24.798
and makes us realize
we are a part of nature,

00:01:24.822 --> 00:01:26.555
and we're not separate from it.

00:01:28.009 --> 00:01:30.033
When we see ourselves in nature,

00:01:30.057 --> 00:01:33.038
it also connects us to every one of us,

00:01:33.062 --> 00:01:35.945
because it's clear
that it's all connected in one.

00:01:37.693 --> 00:01:40.733
When people see my images,
a lot of times they'll say,

00:01:40.757 --> 00:01:42.047
"Oh my God."

00:01:42.693 --> 00:01:44.661
Have you ever wondered what that meant?

00:01:45.105 --> 00:01:47.794
The "oh" means it caught your attention;

00:01:47.818 --> 00:01:50.075
it makes you present, makes you mindful.

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:54.897
The "my" means it connects
with something deep inside your soul.

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:59.501
It creates a gateway for your inner voice
to rise up and be heard.

00:02:00.169 --> 00:02:01.446
And "God"?

00:02:02.065 --> 00:02:05.246
God is that personal journey
we all want to be on,

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:06.541
to be inspired,

00:02:07.717 --> 00:02:11.225
to feel like we're connected
to a universe that celebrates life.

00:02:13.225 --> 00:02:17.288
Did you know that 80 percent
of the information we receive

00:02:17.312 --> 00:02:19.439
comes through our eyes,

00:02:19.463 --> 00:02:22.648
and if you compare light energy
to musical scales,

00:02:22.672 --> 00:02:25.498
it would only be one octave
that the naked eye could see,

00:02:25.522 --> 00:02:27.006
which is right in the middle?

00:02:27.878 --> 00:02:29.807
And aren't we grateful for our brains,

00:02:29.831 --> 00:02:33.797
that can take this electrical impulse
that comes from light energy

00:02:33.821 --> 00:02:37.242
to create images in order
for us to explore our world?

00:02:39.141 --> 00:02:43.335
And aren't we grateful that we have hearts
that can feel these vibrations

00:02:43.359 --> 00:02:45.935
in order for us to allow ourselves

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:48.412
to feel the pleasure
and the beauty of nature?

00:02:53.911 --> 00:02:55.265
Nature's beauty is a gift

00:02:55.289 --> 00:02:58.553
that cultivates
appreciation and gratitude.

00:03:02.722 --> 00:03:05.381
So, I have a gift I want
to share with you today,

00:03:05.405 --> 00:03:08.900
a project I'm working on
called "Happiness Revealed."

00:03:08.924 --> 00:03:11.995
And it'll give us a glimpse
into that perspective --

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:15.408
from the point of view
of a child and an elderly man --

00:03:15.432 --> 00:03:16.725
of that world.

00:03:20.496 --> 00:03:23.269
Little girl: When I watch TV,

00:03:25.309 --> 00:03:30.468
it's just some shows
that you just -- that are pretend.

00:03:30.492 --> 00:03:32.914
And when you explore,

00:03:32.938 --> 00:03:37.894
you get more imagination
than you already had,

00:03:37.918 --> 00:03:41.090
and when you get more imagination,

00:03:41.114 --> 00:03:43.613
it makes you want to go deeper in

00:03:43.637 --> 00:03:46.817
so you can get more
and see beautifuller things,

00:03:46.841 --> 00:03:49.272
like the path,

00:03:49.296 --> 00:03:54.121
if it's a path, it could lead you
to a beach or something,

00:03:54.145 --> 00:03:55.788
and it could be beautiful.

00:03:58.752 --> 00:04:04.084
(Music)

00:04:25.211 --> 00:04:28.889
(Narrator) Brother David Steindl-Rast:
Do you think this is just another day

00:04:28.914 --> 00:04:30.405
in your life?

00:04:31.707 --> 00:04:34.383
It's not just another day.

00:04:34.407 --> 00:04:38.245
It's the one day that is given to you:

00:04:38.269 --> 00:04:39.589
today.

00:04:39.613 --> 00:04:41.919
(Music)

00:04:41.943 --> 00:04:43.854
It's given to you.

00:04:44.974 --> 00:04:46.421
It's a gift.

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:51.214
It's the only gift
that you have right now.

00:04:52.096 --> 00:04:54.977
And the only appropriate response

00:04:55.001 --> 00:04:56.779
is gratefulness.

00:04:58.413 --> 00:05:02.961
(Music)

00:05:06.092 --> 00:05:12.065
If you do nothing else
but to cultivate that response

00:05:12.089 --> 00:05:16.277
to the great gift that this unique day is,

00:05:17.478 --> 00:05:23.904
if you learn to respond
as if it were the first day in your life

00:05:23.928 --> 00:05:26.610
and the very last day,

00:05:26.634 --> 00:05:31.696
then you will have spent
this day very well.

00:05:32.664 --> 00:05:34.664
(Music)

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:37.465
Begin by opening your eyes

00:05:37.489 --> 00:05:40.964
and be surprised
that you have eyes you can open,

00:05:42.217 --> 00:05:47.473
that incredible array of colors
that is constantly offered to us

00:05:47.497 --> 00:05:49.648
for our pure enjoyment.

00:05:51.942 --> 00:05:53.714
Look at the sky.

00:05:55.359 --> 00:05:57.732
We so rarely look at the sky.

00:05:58.834 --> 00:06:05.163
We so rarely note how different it is
from moment to moment,

00:06:05.187 --> 00:06:07.068
with clouds coming and going.

00:06:08.921 --> 00:06:11.282
We just think of the weather,

00:06:11.306 --> 00:06:12.575
and even with the weather,

00:06:12.599 --> 00:06:15.874
we don't think of all
the many nuances of weather.

00:06:16.458 --> 00:06:19.528
We just think of "good weather"
and "bad weather."

00:06:20.647 --> 00:06:24.147
This day, right now, has unique weather,

00:06:25.359 --> 00:06:31.191
maybe a kind that will never exactly,
in that form, come again.

00:06:31.215 --> 00:06:35.262
The formation of clouds
in the sky will never be the same

00:06:35.286 --> 00:06:37.000
as it is right now.

00:06:38.127 --> 00:06:40.591
Open your eyes. Look at that.

00:06:41.447 --> 00:06:43.447
(Music)

00:06:44.013 --> 00:06:47.169
Look at the faces of people whom you meet.

00:06:48.821 --> 00:06:53.053
Each one has an incredible story

00:06:53.077 --> 00:06:56.157
behind their face,

00:06:56.181 --> 00:07:00.732
a story that you could never fully fathom,

00:07:02.444 --> 00:07:07.078
not only their own story,
but the story of their ancestors.

00:07:09.451 --> 00:07:11.444
We all go back so far,

00:07:13.482 --> 00:07:17.254
and in this present moment, on this day,

00:07:17.278 --> 00:07:21.965
all the people you meet,
all that life from generations

00:07:21.989 --> 00:07:24.943
and from so many places all over the world

00:07:26.155 --> 00:07:28.792
flows together and meets you here,

00:07:29.839 --> 00:07:32.028
like a life-giving water,

00:07:32.052 --> 00:07:34.867
if you only open your heart and drink.

00:07:35.740 --> 00:07:42.563
(Music)

00:07:43.480 --> 00:07:47.092
Open your heart to the incredible gifts

00:07:47.116 --> 00:07:49.749
that civilization gives to us.

00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:54.093
You flip a switch,
and there is electric light.

00:07:54.117 --> 00:07:59.735
You turn a faucet, and there
is warm water and cold water,

00:07:59.759 --> 00:08:01.641
and drinkable water.

00:08:02.280 --> 00:08:06.750
It's a gift that millions
and millions in the world

00:08:06.774 --> 00:08:08.738
will never experience.

00:08:09.837 --> 00:08:14.977
So these are just a few
of an enormous number of gifts

00:08:15.001 --> 00:08:16.830
to which we can open your heart.

00:08:18.513 --> 00:08:21.784
And so I wish you
that you will open your heart

00:08:21.808 --> 00:08:24.751
to all these blessings,

00:08:24.775 --> 00:08:27.191
and let them flow through you,

00:08:28.270 --> 00:08:31.608
that everyone whom you
will meet on this day

00:08:31.632 --> 00:08:33.889
will be blessed by you,

00:08:35.599 --> 00:08:37.328
just by your eyes,

00:08:39.048 --> 00:08:40.660
by your smile,

00:08:42.835 --> 00:08:44.255
by your touch,

00:08:46.153 --> 00:08:48.086
just by your presence.

00:08:50.517 --> 00:08:54.061
Let the gratefulness overflow

00:08:54.085 --> 00:08:56.623
into blessing all around you.

00:08:57.401 --> 00:08:59.401
(Music)

00:09:00.089 --> 00:09:03.544
And then, it will really be

00:09:03.568 --> 00:09:05.737
a good day.

00:09:15.650 --> 00:09:16.958
(Applause)

00:09:16.982 --> 00:09:18.419
Louie Schwartzberg: Thank you.

00:09:18.443 --> 00:09:19.539
(Applause)

00:09:19.563 --> 00:09:21.108
Thank you very much.

00:09:21.132 --> 00:09:26.531
(Applause)
