00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Meet Tony. He's my student.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
He's about my age,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
and he's in San Quentin State Prison.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
When Tony was 16 years old,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
one day, one moment,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
"It was mom's gun.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Just flash it, scare the guy. He's a punk.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
He took some money; we'll take his money. That'll teach him.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Then last minute, I'm thinking, 'Can't do this. This is wrong.'

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
My buddy says, 'C'mon, let's do this.'

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
I say, 'Let's do this.'"

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
And those three words, Tony's going to remember,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
because the next thing he knows, he hears the pop.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
There's the punk on the ground, puddle of blood.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
And that's felony murder --

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
25 to life, parole at 50 if you're lucky,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
and Tony's not feeling very lucky.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
So when we meet in my philosophy class in his prison

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
and I say, "In this class, we will discuss the foundations of ethics,"

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
Tony interrupts me.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
"What are you going to teach me about right and wrong?

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
I know what is wrong. I have done wrong.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
I am told every day,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
by every face I see, every wall I face, that I am wrong.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
If I ever get out of here, there will always be a mark by my name.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
I'm a convict; I am branded 'wrong.'

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
What are you going to tell me about right and wrong?"

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
So I say to Tony,

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
"Sorry, but it's worse than you think.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
You think you know right and wrong?

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
Then can you tell me what wrong is?

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
No, don't just give me an example.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
I want to know about wrongness itself, the idea of wrong.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
What is that idea?

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
What makes something wrong?

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
How do we know that it's wrong? Maybe you and I disagree.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
Maybe one of us is wrong about the wrong.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
Maybe it's you, maybe it's me -- but we're not here to trade opinions;

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
everyone's got an opinion.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
We are here for knowledge.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.000
Our enemy is thoughtlessness. This is philosophy."

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
And something changes for Tony.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
"Could be I'm wrong. I'm tired of being wrong.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
I want to know what is wrong.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
I want to know what I know."

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
What Tony sees in that moment is the project of philosophy,

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
the project that begins in wonder --

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
what Kant called "admiration and awe

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
at the starry sky above and the moral law within."

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
What can creatures like us know of such things?

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
It is the project that always takes us back to the condition of existence --

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
what Heidegger called "the always already there."

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000
It is the project of questioning what we believe and why we believe it --

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
what Socrates called "the examined life."

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
Socrates, a man wise enough to know that he knows nothing.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
Socrates died in prison,

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
his philosophy intact.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
So Tony starts doing his homework.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
He learns his whys and wherefores, his causes and correlations,

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
his logic, his fallacies.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
Turns out, Tony's got the philosophy muscle.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
His body is in prison, but his mind is free.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
Tony learns about the ontologically promiscuous,

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
the epistemologically anxious,

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000
the ethically dubious, the metaphysically ridiculous.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
That's Plato, Descartes, Nietzsche

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
and Bill Clinton.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
So when he gives me his final paper,

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
in which he argues that the categorical imperative

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
is perhaps too uncompromising

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
to deal with the conflict that affects our everyday

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
and challenges me to tell him

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
whether therefore we are condemned to moral failure,

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000
I say, "I don't know.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000
Let us think about that."

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000
Because in that moment, there's no mark by Tony's name;

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
it's just the two of us standing there.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
It is not professor and convict,

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000
it is just two minds ready to do philosophy.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
And I say to Tony,

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000
"Let's do this."

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000
Thank you.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:29.000
(Applause)
