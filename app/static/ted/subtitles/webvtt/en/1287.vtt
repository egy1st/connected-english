WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
So that's Johnny Depp, of course.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
And that's Johnny Depp's shoulder.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
And that's Johnny Depp's famous shoulder tattoo.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Some of you might know that, in 1990,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Depp got engaged to Winona Ryder,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
and he had tattooed on his right shoulder

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
"Winona forever."

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
And then three years later --

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
which in fairness, kind of is forever by Hollywood standards --

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
they broke up,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
and Johnny went and got a little bit of repair work done.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
And now his shoulder says, "Wino forever."

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
(Laughter)

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
So like Johnny Depp,

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
and like 25 percent of Americans

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
between the ages of 16 and 50,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
I have a tattoo.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
I first started thinking about getting it in my mid-20s,

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
but I deliberately waited a really long time.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
Because we all know people

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
who have gotten tattoos when they were 17

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
or 19 or 23

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
and regretted it by the time they were 30.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
That didn't happen to me.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
I got my tattoo when I was 29,

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
and I regretted it instantly.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
And by "regretted it,"

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
I mean that I stepped outside of the tattoo place --

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
this is just a couple miles from here

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
down on the Lower East Side --

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
and I had a massive emotional meltdown in broad daylight

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
on the corner of East Broadway and Canal Street.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
(Laughter)

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
Which is a great place to do it because nobody cares.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
(Laughter)

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000
And then I went home that night, and I had an even larger emotional meltdown,

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
which I'll say more about in a minute.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
And this was all actually quite shocking to me,

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
because prior to this moment,

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
I had prided myself

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
on having absolutely no regrets.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
I made a lot of mistakes

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
and dumb decisions, of course.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
I do that hourly.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
But I had always felt like, look, you know,

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
I made the best choice I could make

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
given who I was then,

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
given the information I had on hand.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
I learned a lesson from it.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
It somehow got me to where I am in life right now.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000
And okay, I wouldn't change it.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.000
In other words, I had drunk our great cultural Kool-Aid about regret,

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000
which is that lamenting things that occurred in the past

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
is an absolute waste of time,

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000
that we should always look forward and not backward,

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
and that one of the noblest and best things we can do

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
is strive to live a life free of regrets.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
This idea is nicely captured by this quote:

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
"Things without all remedy

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000
should be without regard;

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
what's done is done."

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000
And it seems like kind of an admirable philosophy at first --

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000
something we might all agree to sign onto ...

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000
until I tell you who said it.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
Right, so this is Lady MacBeth

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000
basically telling her husband to stop being such a wuss

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.000
for feeling bad about murdering people.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000
And as it happens, Shakespeare was onto something here,

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
as he generally was.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
Because the inability to experience regret

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000
is actually one of the diagnostic characteristics

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000
of sociopaths.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000
It's also, by the way, a characteristic of certain kinds of brain damage.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000
So people who have damage

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
to their orbital frontal cortex

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
seem to be unable to feel regret

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000
in the face of even obviously very poor decisions.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000
So if, in fact, you want to live a life free of regret,

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.000
there is an option open to you.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.000
It's called a lobotomy.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
But if you want to be fully functional

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000
and fully human

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000
and fully humane,

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000
I think you need to learn to live, not without regret, but with it.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000
So let's start off by defining some terms.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000
What is regret?

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000
Regret is the emotion we experience

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000
when we think that our present situation

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000
could be better or happier

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000
if we had done something different in the past.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000
So in other words, regret requires two things.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.000
It requires, first of all, agency -- we had to make a decision in the first place.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.000
And second of all, it requires imagination.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.000
We need to be able to imagine going back and making a different choice,

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.000
and then we need to be able to kind of spool this imaginary record forward

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:09.000
and imagine how things would be playing out in our present.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000
And in fact, the more we have of either of these things --

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.000
the more agency and the more imagination

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000
with respect to a given regret,

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.000
the more acute that regret will be.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000
So let's say for instance

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000
that you're on your way to your best friend's wedding

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.000
and you're trying to get to the airport and you're stuck in terrible traffic,

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
and you finally arrive at your gate

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
and you've missed your flight.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
You're going to experience more regret in that situation

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000
if you missed your flight by three minutes

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.000
than if you missed it by 20.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000
Why?

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000
Well because, if you miss your flight by three minutes,

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000
it is painfully easy to imagine

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000
that you could have made different decisions

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000
that would have led to a better outcome.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000
"I should have taken the bridge and not the tunnel.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.000
I should have gone through that yellow light."

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.000
These are the classic conditions that create regret.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.000
We feel regret when we think we are responsible

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000
for a decision that came out badly,

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000
but almost came out well.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000
Now within that framework,

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.000
we can obviously experience regret about a lot of different things.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.000
This session today is about behavioral economics.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.000
And most of what we know about regret

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000
comes to us out of that domain.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.000
We have a vast body of literature

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000
on consumer and financial decisions

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000
and the regrets associated with them --

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000
buyer's remorse, basically.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.000
But then finally, it occurred to some researchers to step back

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000
and say, well okay, but overall,

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000
what do we regret most in life?

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.000
Here's what the answers turn out to look like.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000
So top six regrets --

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000
the things we regret most in life:

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000
Number one by far, education.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000
33 percent of all of our regrets

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000
pertain to decisions we made about education.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000
We wish we'd gotten more of it.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.000
We wish we'd taken better advantage of the education that we did have.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.000
We wish we'd chosen to study a different topic.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.000
Others very high on our list of regrets

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.000
include career, romance, parenting,

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.000
various decisions and choices about our sense of self

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.000
and how we spend our leisure time --

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000
or actually more specifically,

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000
how we fail to spend our leisure time.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.000
The remaining regrets

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.000
pertain to these things:

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.000
finance, family issues unrelated to romance or parenting,

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.000
health, friends,

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.000
spirituality and community.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.000
So in other words, we know most of what we know about regret

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000
by the study of finance.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000
But it turns out, when you look overall at what people regret in life,

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.000
you know what, our financial decisions don't even rank.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:33.000
They account for less than three percent of our total regrets.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.000
So if you're sitting there stressing

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.000
about large cap versus small cap,

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000
or company A versus company B,

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.000
or should you buy the Subaru or the Prius,

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.000
you know what, let it go.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.000
Odds are, you're not going to care in five years.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.000
But for these things that we actually do really care about

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.000
and do experience profound regret around,

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:55.000
what does that experience feel like?

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.000
We all know the short answer.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000
It feels terrible. Regret feels awful.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000
But it turns out that regret feels awful

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.000
in four very specific and consistent ways.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.000
So the first consistent component of regret

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:10.000
is basically denial.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.000
When I went home that night after getting my tattoo,

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000
I basically stayed up all night.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.000
And for the first several hours,

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.000
there was exactly one thought in my head.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.000
And the thought was,

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.000
"Make it go away!"

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:28.000
This is an unbelievably primitive emotional response.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:31.000
I mean, it's right up there with, "I want my mommy!"

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.000
We're not trying to solve the problem.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:36.000
We're not trying to understand how the problem came about.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.000
We just want it to vanish.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.000
The second characteristic component of regret

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.000
is a sense of bewilderment.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:46.000
So the other thing I thought about there in my bedroom that night

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:49.000
was, "How could I have done that?

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:52.000
What was I thinking?"

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000
This real sense of alienation

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.000
from the part of us that made a decision we regret.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.000
We can't identify with that part.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000
We don't understand that part.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000
And we certainly don't have any empathy for that part --

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:05.000
which explains the third consistent component of regret,

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.000
which is an intense desire to punish ourselves.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.000
That's why, in the face of our regret,

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:12.000
the thing we consistently say is, "I could have kicked myself."

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.000
The fourth component here

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.000
is that regret is what psychologists call perseverative.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:20.000
To perseverate means to focus obsessively and repeatedly

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.000
on the exact same thing.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.000
Now the effect of perseveration

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000
is to basically take these first three components of regret

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:29.000
and put them on an infinite loop.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:32.000
So it's not that I sat there in my bedroom that night,

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:35.000
thinking, "Make it go away."

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.000
It's that I sat there and I thought,

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.000
"Make it go away. Make it go away.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.000
Make it go away. Make it go away."

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.000
So if you look at the psychological literature,

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:48.000
these are the four consistent defining components of regret.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.000
But I want to suggest that there's also a fifth one.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.000
And I think of this

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:56.000
as a kind of existential wake-up call.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.000
That night in my apartment,

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:01.000
after I got done kicking myself and so forth,

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.000
I lay in bed for a long time,

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:07.000
and I thought about skin grafts.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.000
And then I thought about how,

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.000
much as travel insurance doesn't cover acts of God,

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:16.000
probably my health insurance did not cover acts of idiocy.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:20.000
In point of fact, no insurance covers acts of idiocy.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.000
The whole point of acts of idiocy

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.000
is that they leave you totally uninsured;

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.000
they leave you exposed to the world

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:29.000
and exposed to your own vulnerability and fallibility

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:33.000
in face of, frankly, a fairly indifferent universe.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:37.000
This is obviously an incredibly painful experience.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:40.000
And I think it's particularly painful for us now in the West

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.000
in the grips of what I sometimes think of

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.000
as a Control-Z culture --

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.000
Control-Z like the computer command,

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.000
undo.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:52.000
We're incredibly used to not having to face

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.000
life's hard realities, in a certain sense.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.000
We think we can throw money at the problem

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.000
or throw technology at the problem --

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.000
we can undo and unfriend

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.000
and unfollow.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:06.000
And the problem is that there are certain things that happen in life

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:09.000
that we desperately want to change

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.000
and we cannot.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.000
Sometimes instead of Control-Z,

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.000
we actually have zero control.

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:19.000
And for those of us who are control freaks and perfectionists --

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.000
and I know where of I speak --

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.000
this is really hard,

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:26.000
because we want to do everything ourselves and we want to do it right.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.000
Now there is a case to be made

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:32.000
that control freaks and perfectionists should not get tattoos,

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:35.000
and I'm going to return to that point in a few minutes.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.000
But first I want to say

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.000
that the intensity and persistence

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:42.000
with which we experience these emotional components of regret

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.000
is obviously going to vary

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:47.000
depending on the specific thing that we're feeling regretful about.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.000
So for instance, here's one of my favorite

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:53.000
automatic generators of regret in modern life.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.000
(Laughter)

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.000
Text: Relpy to all.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.000
And the amazing thing

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:02.000
about this really insidious technological innovation

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:04.000
is that even just with this one thing,

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:07.000
we can experience a huge range of regret.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:10.000
You can accidentally hit "reply all" to an email

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:13.000
and torpedo a relationship.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:16.000
Or you can just have an incredibly embarrassing day at work.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:20.000
Or you can have your last day at work.

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.000
And this doesn't even touch

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:25.000
on the really profound regrets of a life.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.000
Because of course, sometimes we do make decisions

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:31.000
that have irrevocable and terrible consequences,

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:34.000
either for our own or for other people's

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.000
health and happiness and livelihoods,

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:40.000
and in the very worst case scenario, even their lives.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:43.000
Now obviously, those kinds of regrets

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:47.000
are incredibly piercing and enduring.

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:50.000
I mean, even the stupid "reply all" regrets

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:54.000
can leave us in a fit of excruciating agony for days.

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:58.000
So how are we supposed to live with this?

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.000
I want to suggest that there's three things

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:03.000
that help us to make our peace with regret.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:05.000
And the first of these

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:08.000
is to take some comfort in its universality.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:13.000
If you Google regret and tattoo,

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:15.000
you will get 11.5 million hits.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:17.000
(Laughter)

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:19.000
The FDA estimates

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:21.000
that of all the Americans who have tattoos,

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:24.000
17 percent of us regret getting them.

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:26.000
That is Johnny Depp and me

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.000
and our seven million friends.

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:31.000
And that's just regret about tattoos.

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:34.000
We are all in this together.

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:37.000
The second way that we can help make our peace with regret

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:40.000
is to laugh at ourselves.

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:42.000
Now in my case, this really wasn't a problem,

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:45.000
because it's actually very easy to laugh at yourself

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:47.000
when you're 29 years old and you want your mommy

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:50.000
because you don't like your new tattoo.

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:54.000
But it might seem like a kind of cruel or glib suggestion

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:57.000
when it comes to these more profound regrets.

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:00.000
I don't think that's the case though.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:03.000
All of us who've experienced regret

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:07.000
that contains real pain and real grief

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:10.000
understand that humor and even black humor

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:13.000
plays a crucial role in helping us survive.

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:15.000
It connects the poles of our lives back together,

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:17.000
the positive and the negative,

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:21.000
and it sends a little current of life back into us.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:24.000
The third way that I think we can help make our peace with regret

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:27.000
is through the passage of time,

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:29.000
which, as we know, heals all wounds --

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:32.000
except for tattoos, which are permanent.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:35.000
So it's been several years

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:38.000
since I got my own tattoo.

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:43.000
And do you guys just want to see it?

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:45.000
All right.

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:48.000
Actually, you know what, I should warn you,

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.000
you're going to be disappointed.

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:53.000
Because it's actually not that hideous.

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:56.000
I didn't tattoo Marilyn Manson's face

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:58.000
on some indiscreet part of myself or something.

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:00.000
When other people see my tattoo,

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.000
for the most part they like how it looks.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.000
It's just that I don't like how it looks.

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:07.000
And as I said earlier, I'm a perfectionist.

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:10.000
But I'll let you see it anyway.

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:17.000
This is my tattoo.

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:21.000
I can guess what some of you are thinking.

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:24.000
So let me reassure you about something.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.000
Some of your own regrets

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:30.000
are also not as ugly as you think they are.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.000
I got this tattoo

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.000
because I spent most of my 20s

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:36.000
living outside the country and traveling.

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:38.000
And when I came and settled in New York afterward,

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:40.000
I was worried that I would forget

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:43.000
some of the most important lessons that I learned during that time.

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:46.000
Specifically the two things I learned about myself

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.000
that I most didn't want to forget

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:51.000
was how important it felt to keep exploring

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:54.000
and, simultaneously, how important it is

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:57.000
to somehow keep an eye on your own true north.

00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:59.000
And what I loved about this image of the compass

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:01.000
was that I felt like it encapsulated both of these ideas

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:04.000
in one simple image.

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:07.000
And I thought it might serve as a kind of permanent mnemonic device.

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:10.000
Well it did.

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:13.000
But it turns out, it doesn't remind me of the thing I thought it would;

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:17.000
it reminds me constantly of something else instead.

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:19.000
It actually reminds me

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:22.000
of the most important lesson regret can teach us,

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:25.000
which is also one of the most important lessons life teaches us.

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:28.000
And ironically, I think it's probably the single most important thing

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:31.000
I possibly could have tattooed onto my body --

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:33.000
partly as a writer,

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:35.000
but also just as a human being.

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:39.000
Here's the thing,

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:41.000
if we have goals

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:43.000
and dreams,

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:47.000
and we want to do our best,

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:49.000
and if we love people

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:51.000
and we don't want to hurt them or lose them,

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:55.000
we should feel pain when things go wrong.

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:59.000
The point isn't to live without any regrets.

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:03.000
The point is to not hate ourselves for having them.

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:05.000
The lesson that I ultimately learned from my tattoo

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:07.000
and that I want to leave you with today

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:09.000
is this:

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:11.000
We need to learn to love

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:13.000
the flawed, imperfect things

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:15.000
that we create

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:18.000
and to forgive ourselves for creating them.

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:22.000
Regret doesn't remind us that we did badly.

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:25.000
It reminds us that we know we can do better.

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:27.000
Thank you.

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:30.000
(Applause)
