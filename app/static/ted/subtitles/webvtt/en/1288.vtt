00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:05.000
In 1994, I walked into a prison in Cambodia,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
and I met a 12-year-old boy

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
who had been tortured

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
and was denied access to counsel.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
And as I looked into his eyes, I realized

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
that for the hundreds of letters I had written

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
for political prisoners, that I would never have

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
written a letter for him,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
because he was not a 12-year-old boy who

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
had done something important for anybody.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
He was not a political prisoner.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
He was a 12-year-old boy who had

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
stolen a bicycle.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
What I also realized at that point was that

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
it was not only Cambodia, but

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
of the 113

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
developing countries that torture,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
93 of these countries have all passed laws

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
that say you have a right to a lawyer

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
and you have a right not to be tortured.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
And what I recognized was that there was an

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
incredible window of opportunity for us

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
as a world community to come together

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
and end torture as an investigative tool.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
We often think of torture as being

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
political torture or reserved for

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
just the worst, but, in fact,

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
95 percent of torture today

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
is not for political prisoners.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
It is for people who are

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
in broken-down legal systems,

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
and unfortunately because torture is

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
the cheapest form of investigation --

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
it's cheaper than having a legal system,

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
cheaper than having a lawyer

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
and early access to counsel --

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
it is what happens most of the time.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
I believe today that it is possible for us

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
as a world community, if we make a decision,

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
to come together and end torture

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
as an investigative tool in our lifetime,

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
but it will require three things.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
First is the training, empowerment,

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
and connection of defenders worldwide.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
The second is insuring that there is

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
systematic early access to counsel.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
And the third is commitment.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
So in the year 2000,

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
I began to wonder,

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000
what if we came together?

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
Could we do something

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
for these 93 countries?

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
And I founded International Bridges to Justice

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
which has a specific mission of

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
ending torture as an investigative tool

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
and implementing due process rights

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
in the 93 countries by placing trained lawyers

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
at an early stage in police stations

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
and in courtrooms.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
My first experiences, though, did come

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
from Cambodia, and at the time I remember

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
first coming to Cambodia and there were,

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
in 1994, still less than

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
10 attorneys in the country because

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
the Khmer Rouge had killed them all.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
And even 20 years later, there was only

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
10 lawyers in the country, so consequently

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
you'd walk into a prison and

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000
not only would you meet 12-year-old boys,

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
you'd meet women and you'd say,

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
"Why are you here?" Women would say,

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
"Well I've been here for 10 years because

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
my husband committed a crime, but they can't find him."

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
So it's just a place where there was no rule of law.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
The first group of defenders came together

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
and I still remember, as I was training, I said,

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
"Okay, what do you do for an investigation?"

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
And there was silence in the class, and finally

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
one woman stood up, [inaudible name],

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000
and she said "Khrew," which means "teacher."

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000
She said, "I have defended more than

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000
a hundred people, and I've never had to do

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000
any investigation,

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
because they all come with confessions."

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000
And we talked about, as a class, the fact that

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
number one, the confessions

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
might not be reliable, but number two,

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000
we did not want to encourage the police

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000
to keep doing this, especially

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
as it was now against the law.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000
And it took a lot of courage for these

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
defenders to decide that they would

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000
begin to stand up and support each other

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000
in implementing these laws.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000
And I still remember the first cases where

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000
they came, all 25 together, she would

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000
stand up, and they were in the back, and

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000
they would support her, and the judges kept

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000
saying, "No, no, no, no, we're going to do things

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000
the exact same way we've been doing them."

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000
But one day the perfect case came, and it

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000
was a woman who was a vegetable seller,

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000
she was sitting outside of a house.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
She said she actually saw the person

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
run out who she thinks stole

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
whatever the jewelry was, but the police

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000
came, they got her, there was nothing on her.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000
She was pregnant at the time. She had

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000
cigarette burns on her. She'd miscarried.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000
And when they brought her case

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000
to the judge, for the first time he stood up

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000
and he said, "Yes, there's no evidence

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000
except for your torture confession

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000
and you will be released."

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000
And the defenders began to take cases

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000
over and over again and

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000
you will see, they have step by step began

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000
to change the course of history in Cambodia.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000
But Cambodia is not alone.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000
I used to think, well is it Cambodia?

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000
Or is it other countries?

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000
But it is in so many countries.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000
In Burundi I walked into a prison and it wasn't

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.000
a 12-year-old boy, it was an 8-year-old boy

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000
for stealing a mobile phone.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000
Or a woman, I picked up her baby,

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000
really cute baby, I said "Your baby is so cute."

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000
It wasn't a baby, she was three.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
And she said "Yeah, but she's why I'm here,"

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000
because she was accused of stealing

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000
two diapers and an iron for her baby and

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000
still had been in prison.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000
And when I walked up to the prison director,

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000
I said, "You've got to let her out.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000
A judge would let her out."

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000
And he said, "Okay, we can talk about it,

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000
but look at my prison. Eighty percent

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000
of the two thousand people here

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000
are without a lawyer. What can we do?"

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000
So lawyers began to courageously

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.000
stand up together to organize a system

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000
where they can take cases.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000
But we realized that it's not only the training

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000
of the lawyers, but the connection

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000
of the lawyers that makes a difference.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000
For example, in Cambodia, it was that

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000
[inaudible name] did not go alone

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000
but she had 24 lawyers with her

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.000
who stood up together. And in the same way,

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.000
in China, they always tell me,

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000
"It's like a fresh wind in the desert

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000
when we can come together."

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000
Or in Zimbabwe, where I remember Innocent,

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000
after coming out of a prison where everybody

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000
stood up and said, "I've been here

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000
for one year, eight years, 12 years

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.000
without a lawyer,"

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000
he came and we had a training together

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.000
and he said, "I have heard it said" --

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000
because he had heard people mumbling

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000
and grumbling -- "I have heard it said that

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.000
we cannot help to create justice

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.000
because we do not have the resources."

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000
And then he said, "But I want you to know

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.000
that the lack of resources

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000
is never an excuse for injustice."

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000
And with that, he successfully

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.000
organized 68 lawyers who have been

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000
systematically taking the cases.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.000
The key that we see, though, is training

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000
and then early access.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000
I was recently in Egypt, and was inspired

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000
to meet with another group of lawyers,

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000
and what they told me is that they said,

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000
"Hey, look, we don't have police

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000
on the streets now. The police are

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000
one of the main reasons why we had

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000
the revolution. They were torturing everybody

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.000
all the time."

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.000
And I said, "But there's been tens of millions

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000
of dollars that have recently gone in

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000
to the development of the legal system here.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.000
What's going on?"

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:49.000
I met with one of the development agencies,

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000
and they were training prosecutors

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000
and judges, which is the normal bias,

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000
as opposed to defenders.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.000
And they showed me a manual which

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.000
actually was an excellent manual.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000
I said, "I'm gonna copy this."

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.000
It had everything in it. Lawyers can come

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.000
at the police station. It was perfect.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.000
Prosecutors were perfectly trained.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000
But I said to them, "I just have one question,

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000
which is, by the time that everybody got to

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.000
the prosecutor's office, what had happened to them?"

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000
And after a pause, they said,

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.000
"They had been tortured."

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.000
So the pieces are,

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.000
not only the training of the lawyers, but

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.000
us finding a way to systematically implement

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.000
early access to counsel, because they are

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000
the safeguard in the system

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:32.000
for people who are being tortured.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.000
And as I tell you this, I'm also aware of the

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000
fact that it sounds like, "Oh, okay, it sounds

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.000
like we could do it, but can we really do it?"

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.000
Because it sounds big.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:44.000
And there are many reasons why I believe it's possible.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:47.000
The first reason is the people on the ground

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:50.000
who find ways of creating miracles

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000
because of their commitment.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:55.000
It's not only Innocent, who I told you about

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:58.000
in Zimbabwe, but defenders all over the world

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:01.000
who are looking for these pieces.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:04.000
We have a program called JusticeMakers,

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.000
and we realized there are people that are

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.000
courageous and want to do things, but

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.000
how can we support them?

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000
So it's an online contest where it's only

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.000
five thousand dollars if you come up with

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.000
and innovative way of implementing justice.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.000
And there are 30 JusticeMakers

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.000
throughout the world, from Sri Lanka

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:23.000
to Swaziland to the DRC, who with

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:26.000
five thousand dollars do amazing things,

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000
through SMS programs,

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.000
through paralegal programs,

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000
through whatever they can do.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:36.000
And it's not only these JusticeMakers,

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.000
but people we courageously see

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:41.000
figure out who their networks are

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.000
and how they can move it forward.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.000
So in China, for instance, great laws

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:48.000
came out where it says police cannot

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.000
torture people or they will be punished.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:54.000
And I was sitting side by side with one of our

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:57.000
very courageous lawyers, and said,

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.000
"How can we get this out? How can we

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.000
make sure that this is implemented?

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.000
This is fantastic." And he said to me,

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.000
"Well, do you have money?" And I said,

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.000
"No." And he said, "That's okay,

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.000
we can still figure it out."

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.000
And on December 4, he organized

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.000
three thousand members

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.000
of the Youth Communist League,

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.000
from 14 of the top law schools,

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.000
who organized themselves, developed

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.000
posters with the new laws, and went

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.000
to the police stations and began what he says

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:26.000
is a non-violent legal revolution

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:29.000
to protect citizen rights.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.000
So I talked about the fact that we need

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.000
to train and support defenders.

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.000
We need to systematically implement

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.000
early access to counsel.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.000
But the third and most important thing is that

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.000
we make a commitment to this.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.000
And people often say to me, "You know,

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.000
this is great, but it's wildly idealistic.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.000
Never going to happen."

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.000
And the reason that I think that

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.000
those words are interesting is because

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.000
those were the same kinds of words

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.000
that were used for people who decided

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.000
they would end slavery, or end apartheid.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.000
It began with a small group of people

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.000
who decided they would commit.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.000
Now, there's one of our favorite poems

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.000
from the defenders, which they share

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.000
from each other, is:

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.000
"Take courage friends, the road is often long,

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.000
the path is never clear,

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.000
and the stakes are very high,

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.000
but deep down, you are not alone."

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:18.000
And I believe that if we can come together

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.000
as a world community to support not only

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:23.000
defenders, but also everyone in the system

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.000
who is looking towards it,

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:28.000
we can end torture as an investigative tool.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.000
I end always, because I'm sure the questions are --

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.000
and I'd be happy to talk to you

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.000
at any point -- "But what can I really do?"

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.000
Well, I would say this. First of all,

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.000
you know what you can do. But second of all,

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.000
I would leave you with the story of Vishna,

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:43.000
who actually was my inspiration

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.000
for starting International Bridges to Justice.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:48.000
Vishna was a 4-year-old boy when I met him

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.000
who was born in a Cambodian prison

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:53.000
in Kandal Province. But because he was

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.000
born in the prison, everybody loved him,

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.000
including the guards, so he was the only one

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.000
who was allowed to come

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.000
in and out of the bars.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:03.000
So, you know, there's bars. And by the time

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:05.000
that Vishna was getting bigger,

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:07.000
which means what gets bigger? Your head gets bigger.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.000
So he would come to the first bar,

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.000
the second bar and then the third bar,

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.000
and then really slowly move his head

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.000
so he could fit through, and come back,

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.000
third, second, first. And he would

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.000
grab my pinkie, because what he wanted

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.000
to do every day is he wanted to go visit.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.000
You know, he never quite made it to

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.000
all of them every day, but he wanted to visit

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.000
all 156 prisoners. And I would lift him,

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.000
and he would put his fingers through.

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.000
Or if they were dark cells, it was like iron

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:33.000
corrugated, and he would put his fingers through.

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.000
And most of the prisoners said that he was

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:37.000
their greatest joy and their sunshine, and they

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.000
looked forward to him. And I was like,

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.000
here's Vishna. He's a 4-year-old boy.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:43.000
He was born in a prison with almost nothing,

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.000
no material goods, but he had a sense of

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:47.000
his own heroic journey, which I believe

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.000
we are all born into. He said,

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.000
"Probably I can't do everything.

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.000
But I'm one. I can do something.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.000
And I will do the one thing that I can do."

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:57.000
So I thank you for having the prophetic

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:00.000
imagination to imagine the shaping

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.000
of a new world with us together,

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.000
and invite you into this journey with us.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.000
Thank you.

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:14.000
(Applause)

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.000
Thank you.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.000
(Applause)

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.000
Thank you.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.000
(Applause)
