00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
My subject today is learning.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
And in that spirit, I want to spring on you all a pop quiz.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Ready?

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
When does learning begin?

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Now as you ponder that question,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
maybe you're thinking about the first day of preschool

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
or kindergarten,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
the first time that kids are in a classroom with a teacher.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Or maybe you've called to mind the toddler phase

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
when children are learning how to walk and talk

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
and use a fork.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Maybe you've encountered the Zero-to-Three movement,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
which asserts that the most important years for learning

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
are the earliest ones.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
And so your answer to my question would be:

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
Learning begins at birth.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
Well today I want to present to you

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
an idea that may be surprising

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
and may even seem implausible,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
but which is supported by the latest evidence

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
from psychology and biology.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
And that is that some of the most important learning we ever do

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
happens before we're born,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
while we're still in the womb.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
Now I'm a science reporter.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
I write books and magazine articles.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
And I'm also a mother.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
And those two roles came together for me

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
in a book that I wrote called "Origins."

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
"Origins" is a report from the front lines

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
of an exciting new field

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
called fetal origins.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
Fetal origins is a scientific discipline

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
that emerged just about two decades ago,

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
and it's based on the theory

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
that our health and well-being throughout our lives

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
is crucially affected

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
by the nine months we spend in the womb.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.000
Now this theory was of more than just intellectual interest to me.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
I was myself pregnant

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
while I was doing the research for the book.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
And one of the most fascinating insights

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
I took from this work

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
is that we're all learning about the world

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
even before we enter it.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
When we hold our babies for the first time,

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
we might imagine that they're clean slates,

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
unmarked by life,

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
when in fact, they've already been shaped by us

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.000
and by the particular world we live in.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
Today I want to share with you some of the amazing things

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
that scientists are discovering

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
about what fetuses learn

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000
while they're still in their mothers' bellies.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
First of all,

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
they learn the sound of their mothers' voices.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
Because sounds from the outside world

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
have to travel through the mother's abdominal tissue

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.000
and through the amniotic fluid that surrounds the fetus,

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
the voices fetuses hear,

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000
starting around the fourth month of gestation,

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
are muted and muffled.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
One researcher says

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000
that they probably sound a lot like the the voice of Charlie Brown's teacher

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
in the old "Peanuts" cartoon.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
But the pregnant woman's own voice

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
reverberates through her body,

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000
reaching the fetus much more readily.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000
And because the fetus is with her all the time,

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000
it hears her voice a lot.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000
Once the baby's born, it recognizes her voice

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
and it prefers listening to her voice

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000
over anyone else's.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
How can we know this?

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
Newborn babies can't do much,

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000
but one thing they're really good at is sucking.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000
Researchers take advantage of this fact

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.000
by rigging up two rubber nipples,

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
so that if a baby sucks on one,

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000
it hears a recording of its mother's voice

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
on a pair of headphones,

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000
and if it sucks on the other nipple,

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.000
it hears a recording of a female stranger's voice.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.000
Babies quickly show their preference

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.000
by choosing the first one.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.000
Scientists also take advantage of the fact

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000
that babies will slow down their sucking

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000
when something interests them

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000
and resume their fast sucking

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.000
when they get bored.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000
This is how researchers discovered

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
that, after women repeatedly read aloud

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.000
a section of Dr. Seuss' "The Cat in the Hat" while they were pregnant,

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.000
their newborn babies recognized that passage

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.000
when they hear it outside the womb.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.000
My favorite experiment of this kind

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000
is the one that showed that the babies

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000
of women who watched a certain soap opera

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.000
every day during pregnancy

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.000
recognized the theme song of that show

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.000
once they were born.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
So fetuses are even learning

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000
about the particular language that's spoken

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000
in the world that they'll be born into.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000
A study published last year

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.000
found that from birth, from the moment of birth,

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000
babies cry in the accent

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.000
of their mother's native language.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.000
French babies cry on a rising note

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.000
while German babies end on a falling note,

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
imitating the melodic contours

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000
of those languages.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000
Now why would this kind of fetal learning

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000
be useful?

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.000
It may have evolved to aid the baby's survival.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000
From the moment of birth,

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000
the baby responds most to the voice

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000
of the person who is most likely to care for it --

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000
its mother.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000
It even makes its cries

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000
sound like the mother's language,

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.000
which may further endear the baby to the mother,

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000
and which may give the baby a head start

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000
in the critical task

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.000
of learning how to understand and speak

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000
its native language.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000
But it's not just sounds

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000
that fetuses are learning about in utero.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.000
It's also tastes and smells.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.000
By seven months of gestation,

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000
the fetus' taste buds are fully developed,

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.000
and its olfactory receptors, which allow it to smell,

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000
are functioning.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.000
The flavors of the food a pregnant woman eats

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000
find their way into the amniotic fluid,

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.000
which is continuously swallowed

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000
by the fetus.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.000
Babies seem to remember and prefer these tastes

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.000
once they're out in the world.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.000
In one experiment, a group of pregnant women

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000
was asked to drink a lot of carrot juice

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.000
during their third trimester of pregnancy,

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.000
while another group of pregnant women

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000
drank only water.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.000
Six months later, the women's infants

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.000
were offered cereal mixed with carrot juice,

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:18.000
and their facial expressions were observed while they ate it.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000
The offspring of the carrot juice drinking women

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000
ate more carrot-flavored cereal,

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000
and from the looks of it,

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000
they seemed to enjoy it more.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.000
A sort of French version of this experiment

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000
was carried out in Dijon, France

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.000
where researchers found

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.000
that mothers who consumed food and drink

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:41.000
flavored with licorice-flavored anise during pregnancy

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.000
showed a preference for anise

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.000
on their first day of life,

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000
and again, when they were tested later,

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000
on their fourth day of life.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:53.000
Babies whose mothers did not eat anise during pregnancy

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:57.000
showed a reaction that translated roughly as "yuck."

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.000
What this means

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000
is that fetuses are effectively being taught by their mothers

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:04.000
about what is safe and good to eat.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.000
Fetuses are also being taught

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.000
about the particular culture that they'll be joining

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.000
through one of culture's most powerful expressions,

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.000
which is food.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.000
They're being introduced to the characteristic flavors and spices

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.000
of their culture's cuisine

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:22.000
even before birth.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:25.000
Now it turns out that fetuses are learning even bigger lessons.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.000
But before I get to that,

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:31.000
I want to address something that you may be wondering about.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.000
The notion of fetal learning

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:36.000
may conjure up for you attempts to enrich the fetus --

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.000
like playing Mozart through headphones

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.000
placed on a pregnant belly.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.000
But actually, the nine-month-long process

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:46.000
of molding and shaping that goes on in the womb

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:50.000
is a lot more visceral and consequential than that.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:54.000
Much of what a pregnant woman encounters in her daily life --

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.000
the air she breathes,

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.000
the food and drink she consumes,

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000
the chemicals she's exposed to,

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000
even the emotions she feels --

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:05.000
are shared in some fashion with her fetus.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:08.000
They make up a mix of influences

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.000
as individual and idiosyncratic

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000
as the woman herself.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.000
The fetus incorporates these offerings

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.000
into its own body,

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:19.000
makes them part of its flesh and blood.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.000
And often it does something more.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:24.000
It treats these maternal contributions

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000
as information,

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000
as what I like to call biological postcards

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.000
from the world outside.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:34.000
So what a fetus is learning about in utero

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.000
is not Mozart's "Magic Flute"

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:40.000
but answers to questions much more critical to its survival.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000
Will it be born into a world of abundance

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.000
or scarcity?

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:47.000
Will it be safe and protected,

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:50.000
or will it face constant dangers and threats?

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.000
Will it live a long, fruitful life

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:55.000
or a short, harried one?

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:58.000
The pregnant woman's diet and stress level in particular

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:01.000
provide important clues to prevailing conditions

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:04.000
like a finger lifted to the wind.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.000
The resulting tuning and tweaking

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:09.000
of a fetus' brain and other organs

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.000
are part of what give us humans

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.000
our enormous flexibility,

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.000
our ability to thrive

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.000
in a huge variety of environments,

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.000
from the country to the city,

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:22.000
from the tundra to the desert.

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.000
To conclude, I want to tell you two stories

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:27.000
about how mothers teach their children about the world

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:30.000
even before they're born.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.000
In the autumn of 1944,

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:36.000
the darkest days of World War II,

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.000
German troops blockaded Western Holland,

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:42.000
turning away all shipments of food.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:44.000
The opening of the Nazi's siege

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:47.000
was followed by one of the harshest winters in decades --

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:51.000
so cold the water in the canals froze solid.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.000
Soon food became scarce,

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:57.000
with many Dutch surviving on just 500 calories a day --

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:00.000
a quarter of what they consumed before the war.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.000
As weeks of deprivation stretched into months,

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:06.000
some resorted to eating tulip bulbs.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.000
By the beginning of May,

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.000
the nation's carefully rationed food reserve

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.000
was completely exhausted.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:15.000
The specter of mass starvation loomed.

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:18.000
And then on May 5th, 1945,

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.000
the siege came to a sudden end

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.000
when Holland was liberated

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.000
by the Allies.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:27.000
The "Hunger Winter," as it came to be known,

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.000
killed some 10,000 people

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.000
and weakened thousands more.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:34.000
But there was another population that was affected --

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.000
the 40,000 fetuses

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:39.000
in utero during the siege.

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.000
Some of the effects of malnutrition during pregnancy

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.000
were immediately apparent

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.000
in higher rates of stillbirths,

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.000
birth defects, low birth weights

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.000
and infant mortality.

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:52.000
But others wouldn't be discovered for many years.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:54.000
Decades after the "Hunger Winter,"

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.000
researchers documented

00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:00.000
that people whose mothers were pregnant during the siege

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.000
have more obesity, more diabetes

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:05.000
and more heart disease in later life

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:08.000
than individuals who were gestated under normal conditions.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:12.000
These individuals' prenatal experience of starvation

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.000
seems to have changed their bodies

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.000
in myriad ways.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.000
They have higher blood pressure,

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.000
poorer cholesterol profiles

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.000
and reduced glucose tolerance --

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:25.000
a precursor of diabetes.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.000
Why would undernutrition in the womb

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.000
result in disease later?

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.000
One explanation

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:34.000
is that fetuses are making the best of a bad situation.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.000
When food is scarce,

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:39.000
they divert nutrients towards the really critical organ, the brain,

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.000
and away from other organs

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:43.000
like the heart and liver.

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:46.000
This keeps the fetus alive in the short-term,

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:49.000
but the bill comes due later on in life

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.000
when those other organs, deprived early on,

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:54.000
become more susceptible to disease.

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:57.000
But that may not be all that's going on.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.000
It seems that fetuses are taking cues

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:02.000
from the intrauterine environment

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.000
and tailoring their physiology accordingly.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.000
They're preparing themselves

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.000
for the kind of world they will encounter

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.000
on the other side of the womb.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.000
The fetus adjusts its metabolism

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:15.000
and other physiological processes

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:18.000
in anticipation of the environment that awaits it.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:21.000
And the basis of the fetus' prediction

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:23.000
is what its mother eats.

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:25.000
The meals a pregnant woman consumes

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.000
constitute a kind of story,

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:29.000
a fairy tale of abundance

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:32.000
or a grim chronicle of deprivation.

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:35.000
This story imparts information

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:37.000
that the fetus uses

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.000
to organize its body and its systems --

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:42.000
an adaptation to prevailing circumstances

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:45.000
that facilitates its future survival.

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:48.000
Faced with severely limited resources,

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:51.000
a smaller-sized child with reduced energy requirements

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.000
will, in fact, have a better chance

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.000
of living to adulthood.

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.000
The real trouble comes

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:00.000
when pregnant women are, in a sense, unreliable narrators,

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.000
when fetuses are led

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:04.000
to expect a world of scarcity

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:07.000
and are born instead into a world of plenty.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:10.000
This is what happened to the children of the Dutch "Hunger Winter."

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.000
And their higher rates of obesity,

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.000
diabetes and heart disease

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.000
are the result.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:19.000
Bodies that were built to hang onto every calorie

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:21.000
found themselves swimming in the superfluous calories

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:24.000
of the post-war Western diet.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:27.000
The world they had learned about while in utero

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:29.000
was not the same

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:32.000
as the world into which they were born.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.000
Here's another story.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:38.000
At 8:46 a.m. on September 11th, 2001,

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.000
there were tens of thousands of people

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:42.000
in the vicinity of the World Trade Center

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.000
in New York --

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:46.000
commuters spilling off trains,

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:49.000
waitresses setting tables for the morning rush,

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:53.000
brokers already working the phones on Wall Street.

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:56.000
1,700 of these people were pregnant women.

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:59.000
When the planes struck and the towers collapsed,

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:02.000
many of these women experienced the same horrors

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:05.000
inflicted on other survivors of the disaster --

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:07.000
the overwhelming chaos and confusion,

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:09.000
the rolling clouds

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:13.000
of potentially toxic dust and debris,

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:15.000
the heart-pounding fear for their lives.

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:17.000
About a year after 9/11,

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:20.000
researchers examined a group of women

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:22.000
who were pregnant

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:24.000
when they were exposed to the World Trade Center attack.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.000
In the babies of those women

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:29.000
who developed post-traumatic stress syndrome, or PTSD,

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:31.000
following their ordeal,

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:34.000
researchers discovered a biological marker

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:36.000
of susceptibility to PTSD --

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:39.000
an effect that was most pronounced

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:42.000
in infants whose mothers experienced the catastrophe

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:44.000
in their third trimester.

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.000
In other words,

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:49.000
the mothers with post-traumatic stress syndrome

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:52.000
had passed on a vulnerability to the condition

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:55.000
to their children while they were still in utero.

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:57.000
Now consider this:

00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:59.000
post-traumatic stress syndrome

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:02.000
appears to be a reaction to stress gone very wrong,

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:06.000
causing its victims tremendous unnecessary suffering.

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:09.000
But there's another way of thinking about PTSD.

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:12.000
What looks like pathology to us

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:14.000
may actually be a useful adaptation

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:16.000
in some circumstances.

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:19.000
In a particularly dangerous environment,

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:22.000
the characteristic manifestations of PTSD --

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:25.000
a hyper-awareness of one's surroundings,

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:28.000
a quick-trigger response to danger --

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:31.000
could save someone's life.

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:35.000
The notion that the prenatal transmission of PTSD risk is adaptive

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:37.000
is still speculative,

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:40.000
but I find it rather poignant.

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:42.000
It would mean that, even before birth,

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:44.000
mothers are warning their children

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:46.000
that it's a wild world out there,

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:49.000
telling them, "Be careful."

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:51.000
Let me be clear.

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:54.000
Fetal origins research is not about blaming women

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:56.000
for what happens during pregnancy.

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:59.000
It's about discovering how best to promote

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:02.000
the health and well-being of the next generation.

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:04.000
That important effort must include a focus

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:06.000
on what fetuses learn

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:09.000
during the nine months they spend in the womb.

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:12.000
Learning is one of life's most essential activities,

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:14.000
and it begins much earlier

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:16.000
than we ever imagined.

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:18.000
Thank you.

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:25.000
(Applause)
