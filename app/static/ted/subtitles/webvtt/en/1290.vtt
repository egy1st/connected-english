00:00:03.161 --> 00:00:25.117
(Music)

00:00:25.117 --> 00:00:27.412
Good afternoon.

00:00:27.412 --> 00:00:31.873
As you're all aware, we face difficult economic times.

00:00:31.873 --> 00:00:34.325
I come to you with a modest proposal

00:00:34.325 --> 00:00:36.857
for easing the financial burden.

00:00:36.857 --> 00:00:38.390
This idea came to me while talking to

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:41.362
a physicist friend of mine at MIT.

00:00:41.362 --> 00:00:44.051
He was struggling to explain something to me:

00:00:44.051 --> 00:00:48.627
a beautiful experiment that uses lasers to cool down matter.

00:00:48.627 --> 00:00:50.534
Now he confused me from the very start,

00:00:50.534 --> 00:00:52.888
because light doesn't cool things down.

00:00:52.888 --> 00:00:56.337
It makes it hotter. It's happening right now.

00:00:56.337 --> 00:00:58.880
The reason that you can see me standing here is because

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:02.652
this room is filled with more than 100 quintillion photons,

00:01:02.652 --> 00:01:06.187
and they're moving randomly through the space, near the speed of light.

00:01:06.187 --> 00:01:07.703
All of them are different colors,

00:01:07.703 --> 00:01:09.643
they're rippling with different frequencies,

00:01:09.643 --> 00:01:12.518
and they're bouncing off every surface, including me,

00:01:12.518 --> 00:01:14.928
and some of those are flying directly into your eyes,

00:01:14.928 --> 00:01:18.128
and that's why your brain is forming an image of me standing here.

00:01:18.128 --> 00:01:19.783
Now a laser is different.

00:01:19.783 --> 00:01:23.786
It also uses photons, but they're all synchronized,

00:01:23.786 --> 00:01:26.493
and if you focus them into a beam,

00:01:26.493 --> 00:01:28.888
what you have is an incredibly useful tool.

00:01:28.888 --> 00:01:31.024
The control of a laser is so precise

00:01:31.024 --> 00:01:33.698
that you can perform surgery inside of an eye,

00:01:33.698 --> 00:01:36.343
you can use it to store massive amounts of data,

00:01:36.343 --> 00:01:38.673
and you can use it for this beautiful experiment

00:01:38.673 --> 00:01:41.146
that my friend was struggling to explain.

00:01:41.146 --> 00:01:44.401
First you trap atoms in a special bottle.

00:01:44.401 --> 00:01:47.361
It uses electromagnetic fields to isolate the atoms

00:01:47.361 --> 00:01:49.547
from the noise of the environment.

00:01:49.547 --> 00:01:52.030
And the atoms themselves are quite violent,

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:56.074
but if you fire lasers that are precisely tuned to the right frequency,

00:01:56.074 --> 00:01:58.702
an atom will briefly absorb those photons

00:01:58.702 --> 00:02:00.585
and tend to slow down.

00:02:00.585 --> 00:02:03.897
Little by little it gets colder

00:02:03.897 --> 00:02:08.410
until eventually it approaches absolute zero.

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:11.586
Now if you use the right kind of atoms and you get them cold enough,

00:02:11.586 --> 00:02:15.363
something truly bizarre happens.

00:02:15.363 --> 00:02:18.185
It's no longer a solid, a liquid or a gas.

00:02:18.185 --> 00:02:22.125
It enters a new state of matter called a superfluid.

00:02:22.125 --> 00:02:24.412
The atoms lose their individual identity,

00:02:24.412 --> 00:02:27.239
and the rules from the quantum world take over,

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:31.334
and that's what gives superfluids such spooky properties.

00:02:31.334 --> 00:02:34.786
For example, if you shine light through a superfluid,

00:02:34.786 --> 00:02:37.811
it is able to slow photons down

00:02:37.811 --> 00:02:40.970
to 60 kilometers per hour.

00:02:47.585 --> 00:02:50.638
Another spooky property is that it flows

00:02:50.638 --> 00:02:53.274
with absolutely no viscosity or friction,

00:02:53.274 --> 00:02:55.538
so if you were to take the lid off that bottle,

00:02:55.538 --> 00:02:57.633
it won't stay inside.

00:02:57.633 --> 00:03:00.410
A thin film will creep up the inside wall,

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:04.634
flow over the top and right out the outside.

00:03:04.634 --> 00:03:07.591
Now of course, the moment that it does hit the outside environment,

00:03:07.591 --> 00:03:11.307
and its temperature rises by even a fraction of a degree,

00:03:11.307 --> 00:03:13.430
it immediately turns back into normal matter.

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:16.996
Superfluids are one of the most fragile things we've ever discovered.

00:03:16.996 --> 00:03:19.357
And this is the great pleasure of science:

00:03:19.357 --> 00:03:23.572
the defeat of our intuition through experimentation.

00:03:23.572 --> 00:03:25.261
But the experiment is not the end of the story,

00:03:25.261 --> 00:03:28.787
because you still have to transmit that knowledge to other people.

00:03:28.787 --> 00:03:31.163
I have a Ph.D in molecular biology.

00:03:31.163 --> 00:03:34.696
I still barely understand what most scientists are talking about.

00:03:34.696 --> 00:03:37.646
So as my friend was trying to explain that experiment,

00:03:37.646 --> 00:03:40.592
it seemed like the more he said,

00:03:40.592 --> 00:03:43.565
the less I understood.

00:03:43.565 --> 00:03:45.936
Because if you're trying to give someone the big picture

00:03:45.936 --> 00:03:50.015
of a complex idea, to really capture its essence,

00:03:50.015 --> 00:03:53.598
the fewer words you use, the better.

00:03:53.598 --> 00:03:56.917
In fact, the ideal may be to use no words at all.

00:03:56.917 --> 00:03:58.474
I remember thinking, my friend could have explained

00:03:58.474 --> 00:04:01.606
that entire experiment with a dance.

00:04:01.606 --> 00:04:05.974
Of course, there never seem to be any dancers around when you need them.

00:04:05.974 --> 00:04:07.863
Now, the idea is not as crazy as it sounds.

00:04:07.863 --> 00:04:11.365
I started a contest four years ago called Dance Your Ph.D.

00:04:11.365 --> 00:04:13.980
Instead of explaining their research with words,

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:16.880
scientists have to explain it with dance.

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:19.249
Now surprisingly, it seems to work.

00:04:19.249 --> 00:04:22.521
Dance really can make science easier to understand.

00:04:22.521 --> 00:04:24.317
But don't take my word for it.

00:04:24.317 --> 00:04:27.204
Go on the Internet and search for "Dance Your Ph.D."

00:04:27.204 --> 00:04:30.462
There are hundreds of dancing scientists waiting for you.

00:04:30.462 --> 00:04:32.545
The most surprising thing that I've learned while running this contest

00:04:32.545 --> 00:04:37.834
is that some scientists are now working directly with dancers on their research.

00:04:37.834 --> 00:04:39.714
For example, at the University of Minnesota,

00:04:39.714 --> 00:04:42.219
there's a biomedical engineer named David Odde,

00:04:42.219 --> 00:04:45.377
and he works with dancers to study how cells move.

00:04:45.377 --> 00:04:47.786
They do it by changing their shape.

00:04:47.786 --> 00:04:50.605
When a chemical signal washes up on one side,

00:04:50.605 --> 00:04:53.730
it triggers the cell to expand its shape on that side,

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:57.011
because the cell is constantly touching and tugging at the environment.

00:04:57.011 --> 00:05:00.982
So that allows cells to ooze along in the right directions.

00:05:00.982 --> 00:05:04.920
But what seems so slow and graceful from the outside

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:07.349
is really more like chaos inside,

00:05:07.349 --> 00:05:11.752
because cells control their shape with a skeleton of rigid protein fibers,

00:05:11.752 --> 00:05:14.597
and those fibers are constantly falling apart.

00:05:14.597 --> 00:05:17.166
But just as quickly as they explode,

00:05:17.166 --> 00:05:19.583
more proteins attach to the ends and grow them longer,

00:05:19.583 --> 00:05:21.766
so it's constantly changing

00:05:21.766 --> 00:05:24.764
just to remain exactly the same.

00:05:24.764 --> 00:05:27.934
Now, David builds mathematical models of this and then he tests those in the lab,

00:05:27.934 --> 00:05:30.709
but before he does that, he works with dancers

00:05:30.709 --> 00:05:34.410
to figure out what kinds of models to build in the first place.

00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:37.503
It's basically efficient brainstorming,

00:05:37.503 --> 00:05:39.758
and when I visited David to learn about his research,

00:05:39.758 --> 00:05:43.102
he used dancers to explain it to me

00:05:43.102 --> 00:05:47.644
rather than the usual method: PowerPoint.

00:05:47.644 --> 00:05:49.997
And this brings me to my modest proposal.

00:05:49.997 --> 00:05:52.866
I think that bad PowerPoint presentations

00:05:52.866 --> 00:05:55.538
are a serious threat to the global economy.

00:05:55.538 --> 00:06:03.467
(Laughter) (Applause)

00:06:03.467 --> 00:06:08.346
Now it does depend on how you measure it, of course,

00:06:08.346 --> 00:06:13.115
but one estimate has put the drain at 250 million dollars per day.

00:06:13.115 --> 00:06:15.296
Now that assumes half-hour presentations

00:06:15.296 --> 00:06:17.353
for an average audience of four people

00:06:17.353 --> 00:06:19.672
with salaries of 35,000 dollars,

00:06:19.672 --> 00:06:21.632
and it conservatively assumes that

00:06:21.632 --> 00:06:25.564
about a quarter of the presentations are a complete waste of time,

00:06:25.564 --> 00:06:28.143
and given that there are some apparently

00:06:28.143 --> 00:06:31.415
30 million PowerPoint presentations created every day,

00:06:31.415 --> 00:06:34.303
that would indeed add up to an annual waste

00:06:34.303 --> 00:06:37.399
of 100 billion dollars.

00:06:37.399 --> 00:06:39.767
Of course, that's just the time we're losing

00:06:39.767 --> 00:06:41.990
sitting through presentations.

00:06:41.990 --> 00:06:46.306
There are other costs, because PowerPoint is a tool,

00:06:46.306 --> 00:06:49.636
and like any tool, it can and will be abused.

00:06:49.636 --> 00:06:52.126
To borrow a concept from my country's CIA,

00:06:52.126 --> 00:06:55.241
it helps you to soften up your audience.

00:06:55.241 --> 00:06:59.489
It distracts them with pretty pictures, irrelevant data.

00:06:59.489 --> 00:07:03.229
It allows you to create the illusion of competence,

00:07:03.229 --> 00:07:05.989
the illusion of simplicity,

00:07:05.989 --> 00:07:10.716
and most destructively, the illusion of understanding.

00:07:10.716 --> 00:07:14.960
So now my country is 15 trillion dollars in debt.

00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:19.945
Our leaders are working tirelessly to try and find ways to save money.

00:07:19.945 --> 00:07:24.414
One idea is to drastically reduce public support for the arts.

00:07:24.414 --> 00:07:26.622
For example, our National Endowment for the Arts,

00:07:26.622 --> 00:07:29.199
with its $150 million budget,

00:07:29.199 --> 00:07:32.211
slashing that program would immediately reduce the national debt

00:07:32.211 --> 00:07:35.572
by about one one-thousandth of a percent.

00:07:35.572 --> 00:07:37.312
One certainly can't argue with those numbers.

00:07:37.312 --> 00:07:42.594
However, once we eliminate public funding for the arts,

00:07:42.594 --> 00:07:45.266
there will be some drawbacks.

00:07:45.266 --> 00:07:49.662
The artists on the street will swell the ranks of the unemployed.

00:07:49.662 --> 00:07:52.069
Many will turn to drug abuse and prostitution,

00:07:52.069 --> 00:07:55.188
and that will inevitably lower property values in urban neighborhoods.

00:07:55.188 --> 00:08:00.095
All of this could wipe out the savings we're hoping to make in the first place.

00:08:00.095 --> 00:08:03.336
I shall now, therefore, humbly propose my own thoughts,

00:08:03.336 --> 00:08:07.118
which I hope will not be liable to the least objection.

00:08:07.118 --> 00:08:09.011
Once we eliminate public funding for the artists,

00:08:09.011 --> 00:08:10.598
let's put them back to work

00:08:10.598 --> 00:08:13.619
by using them instead of PowerPoint.

00:08:13.619 --> 00:08:17.102
As a test case, I propose we start with American dancers.

00:08:17.102 --> 00:08:19.255
After all, they are the most perishable of their kind,

00:08:19.255 --> 00:08:21.414
prone to injury and very slow to heal

00:08:21.414 --> 00:08:24.231
due to our health care system.

00:08:24.231 --> 00:08:27.374
Rather than dancing our Ph.Ds,

00:08:27.374 --> 00:08:30.988
we should use dance to explain all of our complex problems.

00:08:30.988 --> 00:08:33.848
Imagine our politicians using dance

00:08:33.848 --> 00:08:37.626
to explain why we must invade a foreign country

00:08:37.626 --> 00:08:40.498
or bail out an investment bank.

00:08:40.498 --> 00:08:42.460
It's sure to help.

00:08:42.460 --> 00:08:46.212
Of course someday, in the deep future,

00:08:46.212 --> 00:08:48.593
a technology of persuasion

00:08:48.593 --> 00:08:52.022
even more powerful than PowerPoint may be invented,

00:08:52.022 --> 00:08:55.566
rendering dancers unnecessary as tools of rhetoric.

00:08:55.566 --> 00:08:58.142
However, I trust that by that day,

00:08:58.142 --> 00:09:01.457
we shall have passed this present financial calamity.

00:09:01.457 --> 00:09:04.823
Perhaps by then we will be able to afford the luxury

00:09:04.823 --> 00:09:07.943
of just sitting in an audience

00:09:07.943 --> 00:09:09.783
with no other purpose

00:09:09.783 --> 00:09:14.349
than to witness the human form in motion.

00:09:14.349 --> 00:10:25.174
(Music)

00:10:25.189 --> 00:10:54.204
(Applause)
