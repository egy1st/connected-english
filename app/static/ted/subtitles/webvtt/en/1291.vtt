00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Now when we think of our senses,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
we don't usually think of the reasons

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
why they probably evolved, from a biological perspective.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
We don't really think of the evolutionary need

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
to be protected by our senses,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
but that's probably why our senses really evolved --

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
to keep us safe, to allow us to live.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Really when we think of our senses,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
or when we think of the loss of the sense,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
we really think about something more like this:

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
the ability to touch something luxurious, to taste something delicious,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
to smell something fragrant,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
to see something beautiful.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
This is what we want out of our senses.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
We want beauty; we don't just want function.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
And when it comes to sensory restoration,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
we're still very far away from being able to provide beauty.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
And that's what I'd like to talk to you a little bit about today.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
Likewise for hearing.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
When we think about why we hear,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
we don't often think about the ability to hear an alarm or a siren,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
although clearly that's an important thing.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
Really what we want to hear is music.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:12.000
(Music)

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
So many of you know that that's Beethoven's Seventh Symphony.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
Many of you know that he was deaf, or near profoundly deaf,

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
when he wrote that.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
Now I'd like to impress upon you

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
how unusual it is that we can hear music.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
Music is just one of the strangest things that there is.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
It's acoustic vibrations in the air,

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
little waves of energy in the air that tickle our eardrum.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
Somehow in tickling our eardrum

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
that transmits energy down our hearing bones,

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
which get converted to a fluid impulse inside the cochlea

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
and then somehow converted into an electrical signal in our auditory nerves

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
that somehow wind up in our brains

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
as a perception of a song or a beautiful piece of music.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000
That process is entirely abstract and very, very unusual.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
And we could discuss that topic alone for days

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.000
to really try to figure out, how is it that we hear something that's emotional

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
from something that starts out as a vibration in the air?

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
Turns out that if you have hearing loss,

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
most people that lose their hearing

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
lose it at what's called the cochlea, the inner ear.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
And it's at the hair cell level that they do this.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
Now if you had to pick a sense to lose,

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
I have to be very honest with you

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
and say, we're better at restoring hearing

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
than we are at restoring any sense that there is.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
In fact, nothing even actually comes close

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
to our ability to restore hearing.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
And as a physician and a surgeon, I can confidently tell my patients

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
that if you had to pick a sense to lose,

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.000
we are the furthest along medically and surgically with hearing.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
As a musician, I can tell you

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
that if I had to have a cochlear implant,

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
I'd be heartbroken. I'd just be plainly heartbroken,

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.000
because I know that music would never sound the same to me.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000
Now this is a video that I'm going to show you

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
of a girl who's born deaf.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
She's in a very supportive environment.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000
Her mother's doing everything she can.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
Okay, play that video please.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
(Video) Mother: That's an owl.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000
Owl, yeah.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000
Owl. Owl.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
Yeah.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000
Baby. Baby.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000
You want it?

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000
(Kiss)

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
Charles Limb: Now despite everything going for this child

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
in terms of family support

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
and simple infused learning,

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.000
there is a limitation to what a child who's deaf, an infant who was born deaf,

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000
has in this world

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000
in terms of social, educational, vocational opportunities.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000
I'm not saying that they can't live a beautiful, wonderful life.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000
I'm saying that they're going to face obstacles

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.000
that most people who have normal hearing will not have to face.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000
Now hearing loss and the treatment for hearing loss

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000
has really evolved in the past 200 years.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000
I mean literally,

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.000
they used to do things like stick ear-shaped objects onto your ears

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000
and stick funnels in.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000
And that was the best you could do for hearing loss.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
Back then you couldn't even look at the eardrum.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
So it's not too surprising

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000
that there were no good treatments for hearing loss.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000
And now today we have the modern multi-channel cochlear implant,

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000
which is an outpatient procedure.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000
It's surgically placed inside the inner ear.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000
It takes about an hour and a half to two hours, depending on where it's done,

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000
under general anesthesia.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000
And in the end, you achieve something like this

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000
where an electrode array is inserted inside the cochlea.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000
Now actually, this is quite crude

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000
in comparison to our regular inner ear.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.000
But here is that same girl who is implanted now.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000
This is her 10 years later.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000
And this is a video that was taken

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000
by my surgical mentor, Dr. John Niparko, who implanted her.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000
If we could play this video please.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000
(Video) John Niparko: So you've written two books?

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.000
Girl: I have written two books. (Mother: Was the other one a book or a journal entry?)

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.000
Girl: No, the other one was a book. (Mother: Oh, okay.)

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.000
JN: Well this book has seven chapters,

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.000
and the last chapter

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:53.000
is entitled "The Good Things About Being Deaf."

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.000
Do you remember writing that chapter?

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.000
Girl: Yes I do. I remember writing every chapter.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000
JN: Yeah.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:05.000
Girl: Well sometimes my sister can be kind of annoying.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:09.000
So it comes in handy to not be annoyed by her.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.000
JN: I see. And who is that?

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000
Girl: Holly. (JN: Okay.)

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000
Mother: Her sister. (JN: Her sister.) Girl: My sister.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.000
JN: And how can you avoid being annoyed by her?

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.000
Girl: I just take off my CI, and I don't hear anything.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000
(Laughter)

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000
It comes in handy.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.000
JN: So you don't want to hear everything that's out there?

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000
Girl: No.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.000
CL: And so she's phenomenal.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.000
And there's no way that you can't look at that as an overwhelming success.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.000
It is. It's a huge success story in modern medicine.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.000
However, despite this incredible facility

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.000
that some cochlear implant users display with language,

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.000
you turn on the radio and all of a sudden they can't hear music almost at all.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000
In fact, most implant users really struggle

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.000
and dislike music because it sounds so bad.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.000
And so when it comes to this idea

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000
of restoring beauty to somebody's life,

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.000
we have a long way to go when it comes to audition.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000
Now there are a lot of reasons for that.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.000
I mentioned earlier the fact

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000
that music is a different capacity because it's abstract.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000
Language is very different. Language is very precise.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.000
In fact, the whole reason we use it

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.000
is because it has semantic-specificity.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.000
When you say a word,

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000
what you care is that word was perceived correctly.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000
You don't care that the word sounded pretty

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.000
when it was spoken.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.000
Music is entirely different.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.000
When you hear music, if it doesn't sound good, what's the point?

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.000
There's really very little point in listening to music

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000
when it doesn't sound good to you.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.000
The acoustics of music are much harder than those of language.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000
And you can see on this figure,

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000
that the frequency range

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000
and the decibel range, the dynamic range of music

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.000
is far more heterogeneous.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.000
So if we had to design a perfect cochlear implant,

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000
what we would try to do

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.000
is target it to be able to allow music transmission.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.000
Because I always view music as the pinnacle of hearing.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.000
If you can hear music,

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.000
you should be able to hear anything.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:55.000
Now the problems begin first with pitch perception.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.000
I mean, most of us know that pitch is a fundamental building block of music.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000
And without the ability to perceive pitch well,

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.000
music and melody is a very difficult thing to do --

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.000
forget about a harmony and things like that.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:08.000
Now this is a MIDI arrangement of Rachmaninoff's Prelude.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.000
Now if we could just play this.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:34.000
(Music)

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:37.000
Okay, now if we consider

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.000
that in a cochlear implant patient

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.000
pitch perception could be off as much as two octaves,

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.000
let's see what happens here

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.000
when we randomize this to within one semitone.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:49.000
We would be thrilled if we had one semitone pitch perception in cochlear implant users.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.000
Go ahead and play this one.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:08:14.000
(Music)

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.000
Now my goal in showing you that

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.000
is to show you that music is not robust to degradation.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:22.000
You distort it a little bit, especially in terms of pitch, and you've changed it.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.000
And it might be that you kind of like that.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000
That's kind of hypnotic.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000
But it certainly wasn't the way the music was intended.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.000
And you're not hearing the same thing

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000
that most people who have normal hearing are hearing.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.000
Now the other issue comes with,

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.000
not just the ability to tell pitches apart,

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.000
but the ability to tell sounds apart.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:41.000
Most cochlear implant users cannot tell the difference between an instrument.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.000
If we could play these two sound clips in succession.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.000
(Trumpet)

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.000
The trumpet.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.000
And the second one.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:50.000
(Violin)

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.000
That's a violin.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.000
These have similar wave forms. They're both sustained instruments.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.000
Cochlear implant users cannot tell the difference

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.000
between these instruments.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.000
The sound quality, or the sound of the sound

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000
is how I like to describe timbre, tone color --

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000
they cannot tell these things whatsoever.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:07.000
This implant is not transmitting

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:10.000
the quality of music that usually provides things like warmth.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:13.000
Now if you look at the brain of an individual who has a cochlear implant

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.000
and you have them listen to speech,

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.000
have them listen to rhythm and have them listen to melody,

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.000
what you find is that the auditory cortex

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.000
is the most active during speech.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.000
You would think that because these implants are optimized for speech,

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.000
they were designed for speech.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.000
But actually if you look at melody,

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.000
what you find is that there's very little cortical activity

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:32.000
in implant users compared with normal hearing controls.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.000
So for whatever reason,

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:37.000
this implant is not successfully stimulating auditory cortices

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:40.000
during melody perception.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.000
Now the next question is,

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:44.000
well how does it really sound?

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.000
Now we've been doing some studies

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:49.000
to really get a sense of what sound quality is like for these implant users.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.000
I'm going to play you two clips of Usher,

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.000
one which is normal

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.000
and one which has almost no high frequencies, almost no low frequencies

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.000
and not even that many mid frequencies.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.000
Go ahead and play that.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:03.000
(Music)

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:09.000
(Limited Frequency Music)

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:12.000
I had patients tell me that those sound the same.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:15.000
They cannot differentiate sound quality differences

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:17.000
between those two clips.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:20.000
Again, we are very, very far away in just getting to where we want to get to.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:23.000
Now the question comes to mind: Is there any hope?

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.000
And yes, there is hope.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.000
Now I don't know if anybody knows who this is.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.000
This is ... does somebody know?

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:32.000
This is Beethoven.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:35.000
Now why would we know what Beethoven's skull looks like?

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.000
Because his grave was exhumed.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:40.000
And it turns out that his temporal bones were harvested when he died

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.000
to try to look at the cause of his deafness,

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.000
which is why he has molding clay

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.000
and his skull is bulging out on the side there.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.000
But Beethoven composed music

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.000
long after he lost his hearing.

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:53.000
What that suggests is that, even in the case of hearing loss,

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.000
the capacity for music remains.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:59.000
The brains remain hardwired for music.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.000
I've been very lucky to work with Dr. David Ryugo

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:04.000
where I've been working on deaf cats that are white

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:07.000
and trying to figure out what happens when we give them cochlear implants.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:11.000
This is a cat that's been trained to respond to a trumpet for food.

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:24.000
(Music)

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.000
Text: Beethoven doesn't excite her.

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:40.000
(Music)

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:43.000
The "1812 Overture" isn't worth waking for.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:55.000
(Trumpet)

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:59.000
But she jumps to action when called to duty!

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:03.000
(Trumpet)

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:05.000
CL: Now I'm not suggesting

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:08.000
that the cat is hearing that trumpet the way we're hearing it.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.000
I'm suggesting that with training

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:13.000
you can imbue a musical sound with significance,

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:15.000
even in a cat.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:17.000
If we were to direct efforts

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:20.000
towards training cochlear implant users to hear music --

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:23.000
because right now there's virtually no effort put towards that,

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:25.000
no rehabilitative strategies,

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:28.000
very little in the way of technological advances to actually improve music --

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.000
we would come a long way.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:33.000
Now I want to show you one last video.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:35.000
And this is of a student of mine named Joseph

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:38.000
who I had the good fortune to work with for three years in my lab.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:41.000
He's deaf, and he learned to play the piano

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.000
after he received the cochlear implant.

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:46.000
And here's a video of Joseph.

00:12:46.000 --> 00:13:00.000
(Music)

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:33.000
(Video) Joseph: I was born in 1986.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:35.000
And at about four months old,

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:37.000
I was diagnosed with profoundly severe hearing loss.

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:39.000
Not long after,

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:41.000
I was fitted with hearing aids.

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:43.000
But although these hearing aids

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:45.000
were the most powerful hearing aids on the market at the time,

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.000
they weren't very helpful.

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:52.000
So as a result, I had to rely on lip reading a lot,

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:54.000
and I couldn't really hear what people were saying.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.000
When I was 12 years old,

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:59.000
I was one of the first few people in Singapore

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:02.000
who underwent cochlear implantation.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:06.000
And not long after I got my cochlear implant,

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:08.000
I started learning how to play piano.

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:10.000
And it was absolutely wonderful.

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:12.000
Since then, I've never looked back.

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:14.000
CL: Joseph is phenomenal. He's brilliant.

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.000
He is now a medical student at Yale University,

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.000
and he's contemplating a surgical career --

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:21.000
one of the first deaf individuals to consider a career in surgery.

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:24.000
There are almost no deaf surgeons anywhere.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:27.000
And this is really unheard of stuff, and this is all because of this technology.

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:29.000
And the fact that he can play the piano like that

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:31.000
is a testament to his brain.

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:34.000
Truth of the matter is you can play the piano without a cochlear implant,

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:36.000
because all you have to do is press the keys at the right time.

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:38.000
You don't actually have to hear it.

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:41.000
I know he doesn't hear well, because I've heard him do Karaoke.

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:43.000
(Laughter)

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:46.000
And it's one of the most awful things --

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.000
heartwarming, but awful.

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:50.000
(Laughter)

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:52.000
And so there is certainly a lot of hope,

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:54.000
but there's a lot more that needs to be done.

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:56.000
So I just want to conclude with the following words.

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:58.000
When it comes to restoration of hearing,

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:01.000
we have certainly come a long way, a remarkably long way.

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:04.000
And we have a much longer way to go

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:06.000
when it comes to the idea of restoring perfect hearing.

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:08.000
And let me tell you right now,

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:10.000
it's fine that we would all be very happy with speech.

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:12.000
But I tell you, if we lost our hearing,

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:14.000
if anyone here suddenly lost your hearing,

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:16.000
you would want perfect hearing back.

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:19.000
You wouldn't want decent hearing, you would want perfect hearing.

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:22.000
Restoration of basic sensory function is critical.

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:24.000
And I don't mean to understate

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:26.000
how important it is to restore basic function.

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:29.000
But it's really restoration of the ability to perceive beauty

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:31.000
where we can get inspiring.

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:33.000
And I don't think that we should give up on beauty.

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:35.000
And I want to thank you for your time.

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:38.000
(Applause)
