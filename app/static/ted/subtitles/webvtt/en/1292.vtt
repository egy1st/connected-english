WEBVTT

00:00:00.443 --> 00:00:03.916
I just want to start with a little bit
of a word of warning, and that is:

00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:07.870
my job here tonight is to be
a little bit of a "doctor bring-me-down."

00:00:07.894 --> 00:00:11.977
So bear with me for a few minutes,
and know that after this,

00:00:12.001 --> 00:00:14.580
things will get lighter and brighter.

00:00:14.604 --> 00:00:15.767
So let's start.

00:00:15.791 --> 00:00:18.590
I know that many of you have heard
the traveler's adage,

00:00:18.614 --> 00:00:22.650
"Take nothing but pictures,
leave nothing but footprints."

00:00:22.674 --> 00:00:23.828
Well, I'm going to say

00:00:23.852 --> 00:00:27.004
I don't think that's either as benign
nor as simple as it sounds,

00:00:27.028 --> 00:00:31.138
particularly for those of us in industries
who are portraying people

00:00:31.162 --> 00:00:32.610
in poor countries,

00:00:32.634 --> 00:00:34.031
in developing countries

00:00:34.055 --> 00:00:35.433
and portraying the poor.

00:00:35.457 --> 00:00:38.643
And those of us in those industries
are reporters, researchers

00:00:38.667 --> 00:00:40.150
and people working for NGOs;

00:00:40.174 --> 00:00:43.695
I suspect there are a lot of us
in those industries in the audience.

00:00:43.719 --> 00:00:47.100
We're going overseas
and bringing back pictures like this:

00:00:47.124 --> 00:00:48.996
of the utterly distressed

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:50.771
or the displaced

00:00:50.795 --> 00:00:52.768
or the hungry

00:00:52.792 --> 00:00:54.343
or the child laborers

00:00:54.367 --> 00:00:56.094
or the exotic.

00:00:56.118 --> 00:00:58.145
Now, Susan Sontag reminds us

00:00:58.169 --> 00:01:03.105
that photographs, in part, help define
what we have the right to observe,

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:04.577
but more importantly,

00:01:04.601 --> 00:01:06.505
they are an ethics of seeing.

00:01:06.529 --> 00:01:10.349
And I think right now is a good time
to review our ethics of seeing,

00:01:10.373 --> 00:01:14.209
as our industries of reporting
and research and NGO work

00:01:14.233 --> 00:01:16.053
are collapsing and changing,

00:01:16.077 --> 00:01:19.936
in part, by what's being driven by
what's happening in the economy.

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:23.297
But it's making us forge
new relationships.

00:01:23.321 --> 00:01:26.562
And those new relationships
have some fuzzy boundaries.

00:01:26.586 --> 00:01:29.290
I worked at the edge
of some of these fuzzy boundaries,

00:01:29.314 --> 00:01:32.289
and I want to share with you
some of my observations.

00:01:32.313 --> 00:01:37.145
My ethics of seeing is informed
by 25 years as a reporter

00:01:37.169 --> 00:01:40.204
covering emerging economies
and international relations.

00:01:40.228 --> 00:01:43.709
And I believe in a free
and independent press.

00:01:43.733 --> 00:01:46.781
I believe that journalism
is a public good.

00:01:46.805 --> 00:01:49.170
But it's getting harder to do that job,

00:01:49.194 --> 00:01:51.329
in part, because of the massive layoffs,

00:01:51.353 --> 00:01:55.006
because the budgets for international
reporting aren't there anymore,

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:58.674
new technologies and new platforms
begging new content,

00:01:58.698 --> 00:02:01.296
and there are a lot of new journalisms.

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:05.933
There's activist journalism,
humanitarian journalism, peace journalism,

00:02:05.957 --> 00:02:09.867
and we are all looking to cover
the important stories of our time.

00:02:09.891 --> 00:02:16.403
So we're going to NGOs and asking them
if we can embed in their projects.

00:02:16.889 --> 00:02:21.470
This is in part because they're doing
important work in interesting places.

00:02:21.494 --> 00:02:22.775
That's one example here:

00:02:22.799 --> 00:02:26.193
this is a project I worked on
in the Blue Nile in Ethiopia.

00:02:26.217 --> 00:02:30.778
NGOs understand the benefits
of having reporters tag along

00:02:30.802 --> 00:02:31.999
on their team.

00:02:32.023 --> 00:02:35.799
They need the publicity,
they are under tremendous pressure,

00:02:35.823 --> 00:02:39.777
they're competing in a very crowded
market for compassion.

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:43.572
So they're also looking to reporters
and to hire freelance reporters

00:02:43.596 --> 00:02:46.244
to help them develop
their public relations material

00:02:46.268 --> 00:02:48.186
and their media material.

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:50.718
Now, researchers are also under pressure.

00:02:50.742 --> 00:02:56.192
They're under pressure to communicate
their science outside of the academy.

00:02:56.216 --> 00:02:59.788
So they're collaborating with reporters,
because for many researchers,

00:02:59.812 --> 00:03:04.265
it's difficult for them
to write a simple story or a clear story.

00:03:04.289 --> 00:03:06.655
And the benefit for reporters

00:03:06.679 --> 00:03:11.538
is that covering field research
is some of the best work out there.

00:03:11.562 --> 00:03:13.197
You not only get to cover science,

00:03:13.221 --> 00:03:15.604
but you get to meet
interesting scientists,

00:03:15.628 --> 00:03:18.412
like my PhD advisor Revi Sterling,

00:03:18.436 --> 00:03:22.156
she, of the magic research
high tops there.

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:24.530
And it was a discussion with Revi

00:03:24.554 --> 00:03:28.005
that brought us to the edge
of the researcher and reporter,

00:03:28.029 --> 00:03:29.603
that fuzzy boundary.

00:03:29.627 --> 00:03:31.456
And I said to her,

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:34.922
"I was looking forward
to going to developing countries

00:03:34.946 --> 00:03:38.589
and doing research and covering stories
at the same time."

00:03:39.138 --> 00:03:41.697
She said, "I don't think so, girlfriend."

00:03:42.593 --> 00:03:47.272
And that confusion, that mutual confusion,
drove us to publish a paper

00:03:47.296 --> 00:03:50.800
on the conflicting ethics
and the contradictory practices

00:03:50.824 --> 00:03:52.389
of research and reporting.

00:03:52.413 --> 00:03:54.446
We started with the understanding

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:57.719
that researchers and reporters
are distant cousins,

00:03:57.743 --> 00:04:00.861
equally storytellers and social analysts.

00:04:00.885 --> 00:04:05.982
But we don't see nor portray
developing communities the same way.

00:04:06.452 --> 00:04:10.568
Here's a very classic example.
This is Somalia, 1992.

00:04:10.592 --> 00:04:12.402
It could be Somalia today.

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:14.862
And this is a standard operating procedure

00:04:14.886 --> 00:04:18.217
for much of the news video
and the news pictures that you see,

00:04:18.241 --> 00:04:21.085
where a group of reporters
will be trucked in,

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:23.706
escorted to the site of a disaster,

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:27.254
they'll produce their material,
take their pictures, get their interviews,

00:04:27.278 --> 00:04:28.893
and then they'll be escorted out.

00:04:28.917 --> 00:04:31.574
This is decidedly not a research setting.

00:04:32.305 --> 00:04:35.129
Now, sometimes, we're working
on feature stories.

00:04:35.153 --> 00:04:37.055
This is an image I took of a woman

00:04:37.079 --> 00:04:40.182
in Bhongir Village
in Andhra Pradesh in India.

00:04:40.206 --> 00:04:42.138
She's at a microfinance meeting.

00:04:42.162 --> 00:04:43.579
It's a terrific story.

00:04:43.926 --> 00:04:46.571
What's important here
is that she is identifiable.

00:04:46.595 --> 00:04:48.420
You can see her face.

00:04:48.444 --> 00:04:51.177
This also is not a research picture.

00:04:51.201 --> 00:04:54.462
This is much more representative
of a research picture.

00:04:54.486 --> 00:04:59.498
It's a research site: you see young women
accessing new technologies.

00:05:00.157 --> 00:05:04.146
It's more of a time stamp,
it's a documentation of research.

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:06.379
I couldn't use this for news.

00:05:07.078 --> 00:05:10.177
It doesn't tell enough,
and it wouldn't sell.

00:05:10.201 --> 00:05:12.780
But then, the differences
are even deeper than that.

00:05:12.804 --> 00:05:17.865
Revi and I analyzed some of the mandates
that researchers are under.

00:05:17.889 --> 00:05:20.575
They are under some very strict rules

00:05:20.599 --> 00:05:23.084
governed by their university
research review boards

00:05:23.108 --> 00:05:26.682
when it comes to content
and confidentiality.

00:05:26.706 --> 00:05:32.021
Researchers are mandated to acquire
document-informed consent.

00:05:32.045 --> 00:05:34.921
Well, as a reporter, if I hang
a microphone on someone,

00:05:34.945 --> 00:05:36.218
that is consent.

00:05:36.657 --> 00:05:40.693
And when it comes to creating the story,
I'll fact-check as a reporter,

00:05:40.717 --> 00:05:43.945
but I don't invite company
to create that story,

00:05:43.969 --> 00:05:45.979
whereas social scientists, researchers,

00:05:46.003 --> 00:05:48.307
and particularly
participatory researchers,

00:05:48.331 --> 00:05:52.286
will often work on constructing
the narrative with the community.

00:05:52.968 --> 00:05:55.468
And when it comes
to paying for information,

00:05:55.492 --> 00:05:58.616
"checkbook journalism"
is roundly discouraged,

00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:02.891
in part, because of the bias it introduces
in the kind of information you get.

00:06:02.915 --> 00:06:06.570
But social scientists understand
that people's time is valuable

00:06:06.594 --> 00:06:08.496
so they pay them for that time.

00:06:09.131 --> 00:06:11.381
So while journalists are well-placed

00:06:11.405 --> 00:06:14.133
to convey the beauty
of the scientific process --

00:06:14.157 --> 00:06:16.604
and I would add, the NGO process --

00:06:16.628 --> 00:06:18.256
what about the warts?

00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:22.555
What happens if a research project
is not particularly well-designed,

00:06:22.579 --> 00:06:26.611
or an NGO project
doesn't fulfill its goals?

00:06:26.635 --> 00:06:28.874
Or the other kind of warts,

00:06:28.898 --> 00:06:32.303
you know, what happens after dark
when the drinks happen.

00:06:32.327 --> 00:06:38.901
Research environments
and reporting trips and NGO projects

00:06:38.925 --> 00:06:40.880
are very intimate environments;

00:06:40.904 --> 00:06:44.061
you make good friends
while you're doing good work.

00:06:44.085 --> 00:06:47.352
But there's a little bit
of Johnnie Walker journalism after dark,

00:06:47.376 --> 00:06:51.170
and what happens to that line
between embedded

00:06:51.194 --> 00:06:52.778
and in-bedded?

00:06:52.802 --> 00:06:55.434
Or what do you do with the odd
and odious behavior?

00:06:55.458 --> 00:06:59.219
The point is that you'll want
to negotiate in advance

00:06:59.243 --> 00:07:00.761
what is on the record

00:07:00.785 --> 00:07:02.422
and off the record.

00:07:02.446 --> 00:07:04.980
I'm going to turn now to some NGO imagery

00:07:05.004 --> 00:07:08.271
which will be familiar
to some of you in this audience.

00:07:09.907 --> 00:07:13.147
(Video) Narrator: For about 70 cents,
you can buy a can of soda,

00:07:13.171 --> 00:07:14.488
regular or diet.

00:07:16.669 --> 00:07:19.655
In Ethiopia, for just 70 cents a day,

00:07:19.679 --> 00:07:23.351
you can feed a child like Jamal
nourishing meals.

00:07:24.159 --> 00:07:27.682
For about 70 cents,
you can also buy a cup of coffee.

00:07:28.572 --> 00:07:31.266
In Guatemala, for 70 cents a day,

00:07:31.290 --> 00:07:35.895
you can help a child like Vilma get
the clothes she needs to attend school.

00:07:36.911 --> 00:07:39.372
Leslie Dodson: Now, there's
some very common imagery

00:07:39.396 --> 00:07:40.953
that's been around for 40 years.

00:07:40.977 --> 00:07:43.428
That's part of Sally Struthers's
famine campaign.

00:07:45.174 --> 00:07:47.947
Some of it is very familiar;
it's the Madonna and child.

00:07:47.971 --> 00:07:53.199
Women and children are very effective
in terms of NGO campaigns.

00:07:53.223 --> 00:07:55.666
We've been looking at this imagery
for a long time,

00:07:55.690 --> 00:07:59.230
for hundreds and hundreds of years;
the Madonna and child.

00:07:59.254 --> 00:08:01.244
Here is [Duccio],

00:08:02.982 --> 00:08:04.574
and here is Michelangelo.

00:08:05.145 --> 00:08:08.309
My concern is: Are we
one-noting the genders

00:08:08.333 --> 00:08:13.058
in our narratives of poverty
in developing communities?

00:08:13.082 --> 00:08:17.653
Do we have women as victims,
and are men only the perpetrators?

00:08:17.677 --> 00:08:20.961
Are they the guys with the AK-47s
or the boy soldiers?

00:08:20.985 --> 00:08:23.734
Because that doesn't leave
room for stories

00:08:23.758 --> 00:08:28.610
like the man who's selling ice cream
at the refuge camp in Southern Sudan,

00:08:28.634 --> 00:08:29.923
where we did a project,

00:08:29.947 --> 00:08:35.404
or the stories of the men who are working
on the bridge over the Blue Nile.

00:08:35.428 --> 00:08:36.640
So I wonder:

00:08:36.664 --> 00:08:39.713
Are these stories inconvenient
to our narratives?

00:08:40.235 --> 00:08:41.758
And what about this narrative?

00:08:43.980 --> 00:08:46.436
This is a for-profit game,

00:08:47.388 --> 00:08:50.967
and its aim is to make development fun.

00:08:50.991 --> 00:08:55.058
One question is: Did they
inadvertently make fun of?

00:08:55.082 --> 00:08:58.900
Another set of questions is:
What are the rights of these children?

00:08:58.924 --> 00:09:01.634
What rights of publicity
or privacy do they have?

00:09:01.658 --> 00:09:03.235
Did they get paid?

00:09:03.259 --> 00:09:04.425
Should they get paid?

00:09:04.449 --> 00:09:06.100
Should they share in the profit?

00:09:06.124 --> 00:09:08.250
This is a for-profit game.

00:09:08.274 --> 00:09:10.441
Did they sign talent waivers?

00:09:10.465 --> 00:09:13.075
I have to use these
when I'm working with NGOs

00:09:13.099 --> 00:09:16.331
and documentary filmmakers
here in the States.

00:09:16.355 --> 00:09:19.768
In the States, we take our right
to privacy and publicity

00:09:19.792 --> 00:09:21.319
very seriously.

00:09:21.343 --> 00:09:24.589
So what is it about getting
on a long-haul flight

00:09:24.613 --> 00:09:26.779
that makes these rights vaporize?

00:09:27.176 --> 00:09:30.049
I don't want to just pick on our friends
in the gaming arts;

00:09:30.073 --> 00:09:31.866
I'll turn to the graphic arts,

00:09:31.890 --> 00:09:37.599
where we often see these monolithic,
homogeneous stories

00:09:37.623 --> 00:09:40.389
about the great country of Africa.

00:09:41.943 --> 00:09:45.185
But Africa is not a country,
it's a continent.

00:09:45.209 --> 00:09:49.330
It's 54 countries and thousands
and thousands of languages.

00:09:49.921 --> 00:09:53.534
So my question is:
Is this imagery productive,

00:09:53.558 --> 00:09:55.350
or is it reductive?

00:09:55.374 --> 00:09:57.311
I know that it's popular.

00:09:57.335 --> 00:10:01.116
USAID just launched
their campaign "Forward" --

00:10:01.140 --> 00:10:05.255
FWD: Famine, War and Drought.

00:10:05.279 --> 00:10:08.651
And by looking at it, you would think
that was happening all the time,

00:10:08.675 --> 00:10:09.833
all over Africa.

00:10:09.857 --> 00:10:12.583
But this is about what's happening
in the Horn of Africa.

00:10:12.607 --> 00:10:18.035
And I'm still trying to make sense
of Africa in a piece of Wonder Bread.

00:10:18.682 --> 00:10:20.443
I'm wondering about that.

00:10:20.467 --> 00:10:23.524
Germaine Greer has wondered
about the same things and she says,

00:10:23.548 --> 00:10:26.841
"At breakfast and at dinner,
we can sharpen our own appetites

00:10:26.865 --> 00:10:31.148
with a plentiful dose
of the pornography of war, genocide,

00:10:31.172 --> 00:10:33.097
destitution and disease."

00:10:33.493 --> 00:10:35.998
She's right. We have
sharpened our appetites.

00:10:36.022 --> 00:10:38.974
But we can also sharpen our insights.

00:10:38.998 --> 00:10:43.225
It is not always war,
insurrection and disease.

00:10:43.632 --> 00:10:45.838
This is a picture out of South Sudan,

00:10:45.862 --> 00:10:48.764
just a couple of months
before the new country was born.

00:10:48.788 --> 00:10:54.095
I will continue to work as a researcher
and a reporter in developing countries,

00:10:54.119 --> 00:10:57.308
but I do it with an altered
ethic of seeing.

00:10:57.756 --> 00:11:01.215
I ask myself whether
my pictures are pandering,

00:11:01.239 --> 00:11:03.750
whether they contribute to stereotypes,

00:11:03.774 --> 00:11:06.453
whether the images match the message,

00:11:07.055 --> 00:11:10.753
am I complacent or am I complicit?

00:11:11.645 --> 00:11:12.802
Thank you.

00:11:12.826 --> 00:11:14.328
(Applause)
