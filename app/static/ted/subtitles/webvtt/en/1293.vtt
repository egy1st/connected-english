00:00:00.609 --> 00:00:05.297
(Singing) I see the moon.
The moon sees me.

00:00:06.296 --> 00:00:11.564
The moon sees somebody that I don't see.

00:00:12.708 --> 00:00:18.351
God bless the moon, and God bless me.

00:00:19.243 --> 00:00:24.655
And God bless the somebody
that I don't see.

00:00:25.673 --> 00:00:31.331
If I get to heaven, before you do,

00:00:31.987 --> 00:00:37.770
I'll make a hole and pull you through.

00:00:38.083 --> 00:00:43.552
And I'll write your name on every star,

00:00:44.062 --> 00:00:46.704
and that way the world

00:00:47.356 --> 00:00:50.638
won't seem so far.

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:54.770
The astronaut will not be at work today.

00:00:55.111 --> 00:00:56.767
He has called in sick.

00:00:56.791 --> 00:01:01.919
He has turned off his cell phone,
his laptop, his pager, his alarm clock.

00:01:01.943 --> 00:01:05.092
There is a fat yellow cat
asleep on his couch,

00:01:05.116 --> 00:01:06.860
raindrops against the window

00:01:06.884 --> 00:01:10.599
and not even the hint
of coffee in the kitchen air.

00:01:10.623 --> 00:01:11.872
Everybody is in a tizzy.

00:01:11.896 --> 00:01:15.842
The engineers on the 15th floor have
stopped working on their particle machine.

00:01:15.866 --> 00:01:17.644
The anti-gravity room is leaking,

00:01:17.668 --> 00:01:19.548
and even the freckled kid with glasses,

00:01:19.572 --> 00:01:22.246
whose only job is to take
out the trash, is nervous,

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:24.979
fumbles the bag, spills
a banana peel and a paper cup.

00:01:25.003 --> 00:01:26.425
Nobody notices.

00:01:26.449 --> 00:01:29.874
They are too busy recalculating
what this all mean for lost time.

00:01:29.898 --> 00:01:31.930
How many galaxies
are we losing per second?

00:01:31.954 --> 00:01:34.004
How long before next rocket
can be launched?

00:01:34.028 --> 00:01:36.899
Somewhere an electron
flies off its energy cloud.

00:01:36.923 --> 00:01:38.889
A black hole has erupted.

00:01:38.913 --> 00:01:41.214
A mother finishes setting
the table for dinner.

00:01:41.238 --> 00:01:43.299
A Law &amp; Order marathon is starting.

00:01:43.323 --> 00:01:45.544
The astronaut is asleep.

00:01:45.568 --> 00:01:47.471
He has forgotten to turn off his watch,

00:01:47.495 --> 00:01:50.246
which ticks, like a metal
pulse against his wrist.

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:51.845
He does not hear it.

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:54.918
He dreams of coral reefs and plankton.

00:01:54.942 --> 00:01:58.081
His fingers find
the pillowcase's sailing masts.

00:01:58.105 --> 00:02:01.173
He turns on his side,
opens his eyes at once.

00:02:01.197 --> 00:02:05.927
He thinks that scuba divers must have
the most wonderful job in the world.

00:02:05.951 --> 00:02:08.794
So much water to glide through!

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:16.298
(Applause)

00:02:16.322 --> 00:02:18.103
Thank you.

00:02:18.127 --> 00:02:22.228
When I was little, I could
not understand the concept

00:02:22.996 --> 00:02:25.041
that you could only live one life.

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:27.140
I don't mean this metaphorically.

00:02:27.164 --> 00:02:30.115
I mean, I literally thought
that I was going to get to do

00:02:30.433 --> 00:02:32.479
everything there was to do

00:02:32.503 --> 00:02:35.099
and be everything there was to be.

00:02:35.123 --> 00:02:36.527
It was only a matter of time.

00:02:36.899 --> 00:02:39.923
And there was no limitation
based on age or gender

00:02:39.947 --> 00:02:43.034
or race or even appropriate time period.

00:02:43.058 --> 00:02:46.509
I was sure that I was going
to actually experience

00:02:46.533 --> 00:02:50.327
what it felt like to be a leader
of the civil rights movement

00:02:50.351 --> 00:02:53.985
or a ten-year old boy living
on a farm during the dust bowl

00:02:54.009 --> 00:02:57.627
or an emperor of the Tang
dynasty in China.

00:02:57.651 --> 00:02:59.652
My mom says that when people asked me

00:02:59.676 --> 00:03:03.255
what I wanted to be when I grew up,
my typical response was:

00:03:03.279 --> 00:03:05.047
princess-ballerina-astronaut.

00:03:05.458 --> 00:03:08.603
And what she doesn't understand
is that I wasn't trying to invent

00:03:08.627 --> 00:03:10.610
some combined super profession.

00:03:10.634 --> 00:03:14.011
I was listing things I thought
I was gonna get to be:

00:03:14.035 --> 00:03:17.096
a princess and a ballerina
and an astronaut.

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:19.859
and I'm pretty sure the list
probably went on from there.

00:03:19.883 --> 00:03:21.881
I usually just got cut off.

00:03:21.905 --> 00:03:24.771
It was never a question
of if I was gonna get to do something

00:03:24.795 --> 00:03:26.855
so much of a question of when.

00:03:27.278 --> 00:03:29.755
And I was sure that if I was going
to do everything,

00:03:29.779 --> 00:03:32.215
that it probably meant I had
to move pretty quickly,

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:34.485
because there was a lot
of stuff I needed to do.

00:03:34.509 --> 00:03:36.779
So my life was constantly
in a state of rushing.

00:03:36.803 --> 00:03:38.970
I was always scared
that I was falling behind.

00:03:38.994 --> 00:03:42.374
And since I grew up
in New York City, as far as I could tell,

00:03:42.398 --> 00:03:44.224
rushing was pretty normal.

00:03:45.128 --> 00:03:48.763
But, as I grew up, I had
this sinking realization,

00:03:49.108 --> 00:03:53.398
that I wasn't gonna get to live
any more than one life.

00:03:53.422 --> 00:03:56.428
I only knew what it felt like
to be a teenage girl

00:03:56.452 --> 00:03:57.603
in New York City,

00:03:57.627 --> 00:03:59.918
not a teenage boy in New Zealand,

00:03:59.942 --> 00:04:03.019
not a prom queen in Kansas.

00:04:03.043 --> 00:04:04.964
I only got to see through my lens.

00:04:04.988 --> 00:04:08.296
And it was around this time
that I became obsessed with stories,

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:11.447
because it was through stories
that I was able to see

00:04:11.471 --> 00:04:15.193
through someone else's lens,
however briefly or imperfectly.

00:04:15.589 --> 00:04:18.701
And I started craving hearing
other people's experiences

00:04:18.725 --> 00:04:22.288
because I was so jealous
that there were entire lives

00:04:22.312 --> 00:04:24.003
that I was never gonna get to live,

00:04:24.027 --> 00:04:26.702
and I wanted to hear
about everything that I was missing.

00:04:26.726 --> 00:04:28.020
And by transitive property,

00:04:28.044 --> 00:04:31.273
I realized that some people
were never gonna get to experience

00:04:31.297 --> 00:04:33.981
what it felt like to be a teenage girl
in New York city.

00:04:34.005 --> 00:04:35.910
Which meant that they weren't gonna know

00:04:35.934 --> 00:04:39.156
what the subway ride
after your first kiss feels like,

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:41.998
or how quiet it gets when its snows.

00:04:42.022 --> 00:04:44.634
And I wanted them to know,
I wanted to tell them.

00:04:44.658 --> 00:04:47.085
And this became the focus of my obsession.

00:04:47.109 --> 00:04:50.734
I busied myself telling stories
and sharing stories and collecting them.

00:04:50.758 --> 00:04:52.742
And it's not until recently

00:04:52.766 --> 00:04:57.075
that I realized that
I can't always rush poetry.

00:04:57.666 --> 00:05:01.004
In April for National Poetry Month,
there's this challenge

00:05:01.028 --> 00:05:04.146
that many poets in the poetry
community participate in,

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:06.234
and its called the 30/30 Challenge.

00:05:06.551 --> 00:05:09.273
The idea is you write a new poem

00:05:09.297 --> 00:05:12.234
every single day
for the entire month of April.

00:05:12.916 --> 00:05:14.972
And last year, I tried it
for the first time

00:05:14.996 --> 00:05:19.146
and was thrilled by the efficiency
at which I was able to produce poetry.

00:05:19.765 --> 00:05:23.375
But at the end of the month, I looked
back at these 30 poems I had written

00:05:23.399 --> 00:05:27.418
and discovered that they were
all trying to tell the same story,

00:05:27.442 --> 00:05:32.251
it had just taken me 30 tries to figure
out the way that it wanted to be told.

00:05:32.275 --> 00:05:36.196
And I realized that this is probably true
of other stories on an even larger scale.

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:38.648
I have stories that I have
tried to tell for years,

00:05:38.672 --> 00:05:43.060
rewriting and rewriting and constantly
searching for the right words.

00:05:43.084 --> 00:05:46.369
There's a French poet and essayist
by the name of Paul ValÃ©ry

00:05:46.393 --> 00:05:49.869
who said a poem is never
finished, it is only abandoned.

00:05:50.178 --> 00:05:51.329
And this terrifies me

00:05:51.353 --> 00:05:54.732
because it implies that I could keep
re-editing and rewriting forever

00:05:54.756 --> 00:05:58.209
and its up to me to decide
when a poem is finished

00:05:58.233 --> 00:06:00.344
and when I can walk away from it.

00:06:00.978 --> 00:06:03.685
And this goes directly against
my very obsessive nature

00:06:03.709 --> 00:06:07.328
to try to find the right answer
and the perfect words and the right form.

00:06:07.352 --> 00:06:09.433
And I use poetry in my life,

00:06:09.457 --> 00:06:12.169
as a way to help me navigate
and work through things.

00:06:12.193 --> 00:06:15.399
But just because I end the poem,
doesn't mean that I've solved

00:06:15.423 --> 00:06:17.407
what it was I was puzzling through.

00:06:18.001 --> 00:06:19.835
I like to revisit old poetry

00:06:19.859 --> 00:06:23.674
because it shows me exactly
where I was at that moment

00:06:23.698 --> 00:06:25.611
and what it was I was trying to navigate

00:06:25.635 --> 00:06:27.769
and the words that I chose to help me.

00:06:28.468 --> 00:06:29.821
Now, I have a story

00:06:29.845 --> 00:06:32.694
that I've been stumbling
over for years and years

00:06:32.718 --> 00:06:35.368
and I'm not sure if I've found
the perfect form,

00:06:35.392 --> 00:06:37.384
or whether this is just one attempt

00:06:37.408 --> 00:06:41.153
and I will try to rewrite it later
in search of a better way to tell it.

00:06:41.177 --> 00:06:44.177
But I do know that later, when I look back

00:06:44.201 --> 00:06:48.200
I will be able to know that
this is where I was at this moment

00:06:48.224 --> 00:06:50.423
and this is what I was trying to navigate,

00:06:50.447 --> 00:06:53.274
with these words, here,
in this room, with you.

00:06:56.105 --> 00:06:57.255
So --

00:06:58.652 --> 00:07:00.152
Smile.

00:07:05.310 --> 00:07:06.794
It didn't always work this way.

00:07:07.874 --> 00:07:10.281
There's a time you had
to get your hands dirty.

00:07:10.305 --> 00:07:14.090
When you were in the dark,
for most of it, fumbling was a given.

00:07:14.416 --> 00:07:17.812
If you needed more
contrast, more saturation,

00:07:17.836 --> 00:07:19.939
darker darks and brighter brights,

00:07:19.963 --> 00:07:22.660
they called it extended development.

00:07:22.684 --> 00:07:25.986
It meant you spent longer inhaling
chemicals, longer up to your wrist.

00:07:26.010 --> 00:07:27.302
It wasn't always easy.

00:07:27.937 --> 00:07:30.707
Grandpa Stewart was a Navy photographer.

00:07:30.731 --> 00:07:33.675
Young, red-faced
with his sleeves rolled up,

00:07:33.699 --> 00:07:36.327
fists of fingers like fat rolls of coins,

00:07:36.351 --> 00:07:39.171
he looked like Popeye
the sailor man come to life.

00:07:39.195 --> 00:07:41.612
Crooked smile, tuft of chest hair,

00:07:41.636 --> 00:07:45.017
he showed up to World War II,
with a smirk and a hobby.

00:07:45.041 --> 00:07:47.707
When they asked him if he knew
much about photography,

00:07:47.731 --> 00:07:51.019
he lied, learned to read
Europe like a map,

00:07:51.043 --> 00:07:54.233
upside down, from the height
of a fighter plane,

00:07:54.257 --> 00:07:56.758
camera snapping, eyelids flapping

00:07:56.782 --> 00:07:58.997
the darkest darks and brightest brights.

00:07:59.021 --> 00:08:02.007
He learned war like he could
read his way home.

00:08:02.520 --> 00:08:05.624
When other men returned,
they would put their weapons out to rest,

00:08:05.648 --> 00:08:08.275
but he brought the lenses
and the cameras home with him.

00:08:08.299 --> 00:08:11.362
Opened a shop, turned it
into a family affair.

00:08:11.386 --> 00:08:14.806
My father was born into this
world of black and white.

00:08:14.830 --> 00:08:18.000
His basketball hands learned
the tiny clicks and slides

00:08:18.024 --> 00:08:20.595
of lens into frame, film into camera,

00:08:20.619 --> 00:08:22.096
chemical into plastic bin.

00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:24.944
His father knew the equipment
but not the art.

00:08:25.308 --> 00:08:27.151
He knew the darks but not the brights.

00:08:27.175 --> 00:08:30.850
My father learned the magic,
spent his time following light.

00:08:30.874 --> 00:08:34.508
Once he traveled across the country
to follow a forest fire,

00:08:34.532 --> 00:08:37.087
hunted it with his camera for a week.

00:08:37.929 --> 00:08:39.381
"Follow the light," he said.

00:08:39.698 --> 00:08:40.874
"Follow the light."

00:08:40.898 --> 00:08:44.071
There are parts of me
I only recognize from photographs.

00:08:44.095 --> 00:08:46.801
The loft on Wooster Street
with the creaky hallways,

00:08:46.825 --> 00:08:49.525
the twelve-foot ceilings,
white walls and cold floors.

00:08:49.549 --> 00:08:52.348
This was my mother's home,
before she was mother.

00:08:52.372 --> 00:08:55.229
Before she was wife, she was artist.

00:08:55.253 --> 00:08:56.992
And the only two rooms in the house,

00:08:57.016 --> 00:08:59.547
with walls that reached
all the way up to the ceiling,

00:08:59.571 --> 00:09:01.158
and doors that opened and closed,

00:09:01.182 --> 00:09:03.443
were the bathroom and the darkroom.

00:09:03.814 --> 00:09:05.893
The darkroom she built herself,

00:09:05.917 --> 00:09:10.512
with custom-made stainless steel sinks,
an 8x10 bed enlarger

00:09:10.536 --> 00:09:12.948
that moved up and down
by a giant hand crank,

00:09:12.972 --> 00:09:14.655
a bank of color-balanced lights,

00:09:14.679 --> 00:09:16.644
a white glass wall for viewing prints,

00:09:16.668 --> 00:09:19.010
a drying rack that moved
in and out from the wall.

00:09:19.034 --> 00:09:21.120
My mother built herself a darkroom.

00:09:21.144 --> 00:09:22.407
Made it her home.

00:09:22.431 --> 00:09:25.091
Fell in love with a man
with basketball hands,

00:09:25.115 --> 00:09:26.995
with the way he looked at light.

00:09:27.375 --> 00:09:29.458
They got married. Had a baby.

00:09:29.482 --> 00:09:31.672
Moved to a house near a park.

00:09:31.696 --> 00:09:33.609
But they kept the loft on Wooster Street

00:09:33.633 --> 00:09:36.182
for birthday parties and treasure hunts.

00:09:36.206 --> 00:09:38.610
The baby tipped the grayscale,

00:09:38.634 --> 00:09:42.269
filled her parents' photo albums
with red balloons and yellow icing.

00:09:42.293 --> 00:09:45.062
The baby grew into a girl
without freckles,

00:09:45.086 --> 00:09:46.578
with a crooked smile,

00:09:46.602 --> 00:09:51.062
who didnât understand why her friends
did not have darkrooms in their houses,

00:09:51.086 --> 00:09:52.998
who never saw her parents kiss,

00:09:53.022 --> 00:09:54.554
who never saw them hold hands.

00:09:55.006 --> 00:09:56.744
But one day, another baby showed up.

00:09:56.768 --> 00:09:59.951
This one with perfect straight
hair and bubble gum cheeks.

00:09:59.975 --> 00:10:01.601
They named him sweet potato.

00:10:01.625 --> 00:10:03.557
When he laughed, he laughed so loudly

00:10:03.581 --> 00:10:05.739
he scared the pigeons on the fire escape

00:10:05.763 --> 00:10:08.739
And the four of them lived
in that house near the park.

00:10:08.763 --> 00:10:11.318
The girl with no freckles,
the sweet potato boy,

00:10:11.342 --> 00:10:13.468
the basketball father and darkroom mother

00:10:13.492 --> 00:10:16.120
and they lit their candles
and said their prayers,

00:10:16.144 --> 00:10:18.198
and the corners of the photographs curled.

00:10:18.959 --> 00:10:21.467
One day, some towers fell.

00:10:21.491 --> 00:10:25.220
And the house near the park
became a house under ash, so they escaped

00:10:25.244 --> 00:10:28.507
in backpacks, on bicycles to darkrooms

00:10:28.531 --> 00:10:31.360
But the loft of Wooster Street
was built for an artist,

00:10:31.384 --> 00:10:34.138
not a family of pigeons,

00:10:34.162 --> 00:10:37.534
and walls that do not reach the ceiling
do not hold in the yelling

00:10:37.558 --> 00:10:41.800
and the man with basketball hands
put his weapons out to rest.

00:10:41.824 --> 00:10:45.063
He could not fight this war,
and no maps pointed home.

00:10:45.442 --> 00:10:47.641
His hands no longer fit his camera,

00:10:47.665 --> 00:10:49.252
no longer fit his wife's,

00:10:49.276 --> 00:10:50.712
no longer fit his body.

00:10:51.299 --> 00:10:53.983
The sweet potato boy mashed
his fists into his mouth

00:10:54.007 --> 00:10:55.580
until he had nothing more to say.

00:10:55.604 --> 00:10:58.902
So, the girl without freckles
went treasure hunting on her own.

00:10:59.497 --> 00:11:02.908
And on Wooster Street, in a building
with the creaky hallways

00:11:02.932 --> 00:11:04.760
and the loft with the 12-foot ceilings

00:11:04.784 --> 00:11:06.752
and the darkroom with too many sinks

00:11:06.776 --> 00:11:09.298
under the color-balanced lights,
she found a note,

00:11:09.322 --> 00:11:13.575
tacked to the wall with a thumb-tack,
left over from a time before towers,

00:11:13.933 --> 00:11:16.564
from the time before babies.

00:11:16.588 --> 00:11:21.520
And the note said: "A guy sure loves
the girl who works in the darkroom."

00:11:22.758 --> 00:11:25.710
It was a year before my father
picked up a camera again.

00:11:26.238 --> 00:11:28.776
His first time out, he followed
the Christmas lights,

00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:31.283
dotting their way through
New York City's trees,

00:11:31.307 --> 00:11:36.006
tiny dots of light, blinking out at him
from out of the darkest darks.

00:11:36.030 --> 00:11:39.928
A year later he traveled
across the country to follow a forest fire

00:11:39.952 --> 00:11:42.464
stayed for a week hunting
it with his camera,

00:11:42.488 --> 00:11:44.340
it was ravaging the West Coast

00:11:44.364 --> 00:11:46.594
eating 18-wheeler trucks in its stride.

00:11:46.618 --> 00:11:48.197
On the other side of the country,

00:11:48.221 --> 00:11:51.579
I went to class and wrote a poem
in the margins of my notebook.

00:11:51.603 --> 00:11:53.563
We have both learned the art of capture.

00:11:54.059 --> 00:11:56.912
Maybe we are learning
the art of embracing.

00:11:56.936 --> 00:12:00.039
Maybe we are learning
the art of letting go.

00:12:01.357 --> 00:12:06.023
(Applause)
