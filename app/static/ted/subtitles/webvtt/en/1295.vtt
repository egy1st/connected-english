WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
How many of you had to fill out a web form

00:00:02.024 --> 00:00:03.536
where you've been asked to read

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:05.696
a distorted sequence
of characters like this?

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:07.673
How many of you found it really annoying?

00:00:07.697 --> 00:00:08.796
(Laughter)

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:10.556
OK, outstanding. So I invented that.

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:12.416
(Laughter)

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:14.296
Or I was one of the people who did it.

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:15.856
That thing is called a CAPTCHA.

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:19.016
And it is there to make sure
you, the entity filling out the form,

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:20.896
are a human and not a computer program

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:23.496
that was written to submit
the form millions of times.

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:27.176
The reason it works is because humans,
at least non-visually-impaired humans,

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:29.616
have no trouble reading
these distorted characters,

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.616
whereas programs can't do it as well yet.

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:33.136
In the case of Ticketmaster,

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:35.256
the reason you have
to type these characters

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.416
is to prevent scalpers
from writing a program

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.696
that can buy millions
of tickets, two at a time.

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:41.656
CAPTCHAs are used all over the Internet.

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:43.256
And since they're used so often,

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:46.416
a lot of times the sequence
of random characters shown to the user

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:47.656
is not so fortunate.

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:50.336
So this is an example
from the Yahoo registration page.

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:53.176
The random characters
that happened to be shown to the user

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:55.896
were W, A, I, T,
which, of course, spell a word.

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.016
But the best part is the message

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:00.496
that the Yahoo help desk
got about 20 minutes later.

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:03.656
[Help! I've been waiting
for over 20 minutes and nothing happens.]

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:08.536
(Laughter)

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:10.465
This person thought they needed to wait.

00:01:10.489 --> 00:01:12.896
This, of course,
is not as bad as this poor person.

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:15.296
(Laughter)

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:19.056
CAPTCHA Project is something that we did
at Carnegie Melllon over 10 years ago,

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:20.536
and it's been used everywhere.

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:23.696
Let me now tell you about a project
that we did a few years later,

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:25.936
which is sort of
the next evolution of CAPTCHA.

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:27.936
This is a project that we call reCAPTCHA,

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.736
which is something that we started
here at Carnegie Mellon,

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:32.768
then we turned it into a start-up company.

00:01:32.792 --> 00:01:36.380
And then about a year and a half ago,
Google actually acquired this company.

00:01:36.404 --> 00:01:38.411
Let me tell you what this project started.

00:01:38.435 --> 00:01:40.966
This project started
from the following realization:

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:43.427
It turns out that approximately
200 million CAPTCHAs

00:01:43.451 --> 00:01:45.602
are typed everyday
by people around the world.

00:01:45.626 --> 00:01:48.110
When I first heard this,
I was quite proud of myself.

00:01:48.134 --> 00:01:50.475
I thought, look at the impact
my research has had.

00:01:50.499 --> 00:01:51.983
But then I started feeling bad.

00:01:52.007 --> 00:01:54.213
Here's the thing:
each time you type a CAPTCHA,

00:01:54.237 --> 00:01:56.576
essentially, you waste
10 seconds of your time.

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:58.536
And if you multiply that by 200 million,

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.576
you get that humanity is wasting
about 500,000 hours every day

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:03.136
typing these annoying CAPTCHAs.

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:04.176
(Laughter)

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:05.629
So then I started feeling bad.

00:02:05.653 --> 00:02:07.456
(Laughter)

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:10.976
And then I started thinking, of course,
we can't just get rid of CAPTCHAs,

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.256
because the security of the web
depends on them.

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:15.696
But then I started thinking,
can we use this effort

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:17.656
for something that is good for humanity?

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:19.176
So see, here's the thing.

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.816
While you're typing a CAPTCHA,
during those 10 seconds,

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:23.696
your brain is doing something amazing.

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:26.536
Your brain is doing something
that computers cannot yet do.

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:29.256
So can we get you to do useful work
for those 10 seconds?

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:32.776
Is there some humongous problem
that we cannot yet get computers to solve,

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:35.576
yet we can split
into tiny 10-second chunks

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:37.776
such that each time
somebody solves a CAPTCHA,

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:39.736
they solve a little bit of this problem?

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:42.896
And the answer to that is "yes,"
and this is what we're doing now.

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:44.856
Nowadays, while you're typing a CAPTCHA,

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:47.309
not only are you authenticating
yourself as a human,

00:02:47.333 --> 00:02:49.776
but in addition you're helping us
to digitize books.

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:51.256
Let me explain how this works.

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:53.696
There's a lot of projects
trying to digitize books.

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:55.856
Google has one.
The Internet Archive has one.

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:58.376
Amazon, with the Kindle,
is trying to digitize books.

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:01.576
Basically, the way this works
is you start with an old book.

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:03.176
You've seen those things, right?

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:04.416
Like a book?

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:05.696
(Laughter)

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:08.256
So you start with a book
and then you scan it.

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:09.496
Now, scanning a book

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:11.896
is like taking a digital
photograph of every page.

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:13.736
It gives you an image for every page.

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:16.336
This is an image with text
for every page of the book.

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:19.496
The next step in the process
is that the computer needs to be able

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:21.256
to decipher the words in this image.

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:24.696
That's using a technology called OCR,
for optical character recognition,

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:26.136
which takes a picture of text

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:28.336
and tries to figure out
what text is in there.

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:31.016
Now, the problem
is that OCR is not perfect.

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:32.456
Especially for older books

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:35.616
where the ink has faded
and the pages have turned yellow,

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:37.576
OCR cannot recognize a lot of the words.

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:40.056
For things that were written
more than 50 years ago,

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:42.936
the computer cannot recognize
about 30 percent of the words.

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:46.336
So now we're taking all of the words
that the computer cannot recognize

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:48.616
and we're getting people
to read them for us

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:50.856
while they're typing
a CAPTCHA on the Internet.

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:54.056
So the next time you type a CAPTCHA,
these words that you're typing

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:56.656
are actually words from books
that are being digitized

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:58.536
that the computer could not recognize.

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:01.016
The reason we have
two words nowadays instead of one

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:02.456
is because one of the words

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:05.056
is a word that the system
just got out of a book,

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:08.096
it didn't know what it was
and it's going to present it to you.

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:10.816
But since it doesn't know the answer,
it cannot grade it.

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:12.216
So we give you another word,

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:14.240
for which the system does know the answer.

00:04:14.264 --> 00:04:17.336
We don't tell you which one's which
and we say, please type both.

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:18.935
And if you type the correct word

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:21.336
for the one for which
the system knows the answer,

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:22.616
it assumes you are human

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:26.096
and it also gets some confidence
that you typed the other word correctly.

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:28.576
And if we repeat this process
to 10 different people

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:30.496
and they agree on what the new word is,

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:32.736
then we get one more word
digitized accurately.

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:34.336
So this is how the system works.

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:36.976
And since we released it
about three or four years ago,

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.936
a lot of websites have started
switching from the old CAPTCHA,

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:41.496
where people wasted their time,

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:44.456
to the new CAPTCHA where people
are helping to digitize books.

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:46.656
So every time you buy
tickets on Ticketmaster,

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:48.056
you help to digitize a book.

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:50.696
Facebook: Every time
you add a friend or poke somebody,

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:52.096
you help to digitize a book.

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:55.056
Twitter and about 350,000 other sites
are all using reCAPTCHA.

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:57.896
And the number of sites
that are using reCAPTCHA is so high

00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:01.056
that the number of words
we're digitizing per day is really large.

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:02.496
It's about 100 million a day,

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:06.016
which is the equivalent of about
two and a half million books a year.

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:08.176
And this is all being done
one word at a time

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:10.416
by just people typing
CAPTCHAs on the Internet.

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:17.320
(Applause)

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:18.896
Now, of course,

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:22.256
since we're doing so many words per day,

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:23.536
funny things can happen.

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:26.176
This is especially true
because now we're giving people

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:28.696
two randomly chosen English words
next to each other.

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:30.056
So funny things can happen.

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:31.816
For example, we presented this word.

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:34.576
It's the word "Christians";
there's nothing wrong with it.

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:37.536
But if you present it along
with another randomly chosen word,

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:38.896
bad things can happen.

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:40.136
So we get this.

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:41.376
[bad Christians]

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:44.296
But it's even worse, because
the website where we showed this

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:47.376
actually happened to be called
The Embassy of the Kingdom of God.

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:49.096
(Laughter)

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:50.336
Oops.

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:54.216
(Laughter)

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:55.936
Here's another really bad one.

00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:57.256
JohnEdwards.com

00:05:57.280 --> 00:05:58.496
[Damn liberal]

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:03.016
(Laughter)

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:05.856
So we keep on insulting people
left and right everyday.

00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:07.896
Of course, we're not
just insulting people.

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:11.096
Here's the thing. Since we're presenting
two randomly chosen words,

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:12.576
interesting things can happen.

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:17.216
So this actually has given rise
to a really big Internet meme

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:19.776
that tens of thousands of people
have participated in,

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:21.456
which is called CAPTCHA art.

00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:23.456
I'm sure some of you have heard about it.

00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:24.736
Here's how it works.

00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:27.376
Imagine you're using the Internet
and you see a CAPTCHA

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:29.136
that you think is somewhat peculiar,

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:30.376
like this CAPTCHA.

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:31.616
[invisible toaster]

00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:34.376
What you're supposed to do
is you take a screenshot of it.

00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:38.056
Then of course, you fill out the CAPTCHA
because you help us digitize a book.

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:39.576
But first you take a screenshot

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:41.976
and then you draw something
that is related to it.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:43.696
(Laughter)

00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:44.936
That's how it works.

00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:46.296
(Laughter)

00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:48.976
There are tens of thousands of these.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.072
Some of them are very cute.

00:06:51.096 --> 00:06:52.309
[clenched it]

00:06:52.333 --> 00:06:54.176
(Laughter)

00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:55.736
Some of them are funnier.

00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:56.976
[stoned Founders]

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:01.376
(Laughter)

00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:04.829
And some of them,
like paleontological shvisle ...

00:07:04.853 --> 00:07:06.776
(Laughter)

00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:08.016
they contain Snoop Dogg.

00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:11.176
(Laughter)

00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:13.776
OK, so this is my favorite
number of reCAPTCHA.

00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:16.976
So this is the favorite thing
that I like about this whole project.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:18.816
This is the number of distinct people

00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:22.576
that have helped us digitize at least
one word out of a book through reCAPTCHA:

00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:25.656
750 million, a little over 10 percent
of the world's population,

00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:27.576
has helped us digitize human knowledge.

00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:30.696
And it is numbers like these
that motivate my research agenda.

00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:33.776
So the question that motivates
my research is the following:

00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:36.216
If you look at humanity's
large-scale achievements,

00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:37.456
these really big things

00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:40.195
that humanity has gotten together
and done historically --

00:07:40.219 --> 00:07:42.696
like, for example,
building the pyramids of Egypt

00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:44.296
or the Panama Canal

00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:46.376
or putting a man on the Moon --

00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:48.096
there is a curious fact about them,

00:07:48.120 --> 00:07:51.456
and it is that they were all done
with about the same number of people.

00:07:51.480 --> 00:07:54.176
It's weird; they were all done
with about 100,000 people.

00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:56.856
And the reason for that is because,
before the Internet,

00:07:56.880 --> 00:07:58.736
coordinating more than 100,000 people,

00:07:58.760 --> 00:08:01.776
let alone paying them,
was essentially impossible.

00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:04.456
But now with the Internet,
I've just shown you a project

00:08:04.480 --> 00:08:07.976
where we've gotten 750 million people
to help us digitize human knowledge.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.176
So the question
that motivates my research is,

00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:12.336
if we can put a man
on the Moon with 100,000,

00:08:12.360 --> 00:08:14.536
what can we do with 100 million?

00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:15.816
So based on this question,

00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:18.896
we've had a lot of different projects
that we've been working on.

00:08:18.920 --> 00:08:21.456
Let me tell you about one
that I'm most excited about.

00:08:21.480 --> 00:08:24.136
This is something that we've been
semiquietly working on

00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:25.856
for the last year and a half or so.

00:08:25.880 --> 00:08:28.256
It hasn't yet been launched.
It's called Duolingo.

00:08:28.280 --> 00:08:30.016
Since it hasn't been launched, shhh!

00:08:30.040 --> 00:08:31.696
(Laughter)

00:08:31.720 --> 00:08:33.976
Yeah, I can trust you'll do that.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.216
So this is the project.
Here's how it started.

00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:39.816
It started with me posing a question
to my graduate student, Severin Hacker.

00:08:39.840 --> 00:08:41.120
OK, that's Severin Hacker.

00:08:42.039 --> 00:08:44.256
So I posed the question
to my graduate student.

00:08:44.280 --> 00:08:47.256
By the way, you did hear me correctly;
his last name is Hacker.

00:08:47.280 --> 00:08:48.296
(Laughter)

00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:51.616
So I posed this question to him:
How can we get 100 million people

00:08:51.640 --> 00:08:54.600
translating the web
into every major language for free?

00:08:55.240 --> 00:08:57.656
There's a lot of things
to say about this question.

00:08:57.680 --> 00:08:59.336
First of all, translating the web.

00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:02.156
Right now, the web
is partitioned into multiple languages.

00:09:02.180 --> 00:09:03.996
A large fraction of it is in English.

00:09:04.020 --> 00:09:06.236
If you don't know English,
you can't access it.

00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:08.956
But there's large fractions
in other different languages,

00:09:08.980 --> 00:09:11.236
and if you don't know them,
you can't access it.

00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:13.356
So I would like to translate
all of the web,

00:09:13.380 --> 00:09:15.756
or at least most of it,
into every major language.

00:09:15.780 --> 00:09:17.276
That's what I would like to do.

00:09:17.300 --> 00:09:21.776
Now, some of you may say,
why can't we use computers to translate?

00:09:21.800 --> 00:09:23.896
Machine translation
is starting to translate

00:09:23.920 --> 00:09:25.376
some sentences here and there.

00:09:25.400 --> 00:09:27.376
Why can't we use it to translate the web?

00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:29.736
The problem with that
is it's not yet good enough

00:09:29.760 --> 00:09:32.256
and it probably won't be
for the next 15 to 20 years.

00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:34.616
It makes a lot of mistakes.
Even when it doesn't,

00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:38.216
since it makes so many mistakes,
you don't know whether to trust it or not.

00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:39.656
So let me show you an example

00:09:39.680 --> 00:09:41.936
of something that was
translated with a machine.

00:09:41.960 --> 00:09:43.416
Actually, it was a forum post.

00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:46.616
It was somebody who was trying
to ask a question about JavaScript.

00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:49.256
It was translated
from Japanese into English.

00:09:49.280 --> 00:09:51.056
So I'll just let you read.

00:09:51.080 --> 00:09:52.856
This person starts apologizing

00:09:52.880 --> 00:09:55.336
for the fact that
it's translated with a computer.

00:09:55.360 --> 00:09:59.136
So the next sentence is going to be
the preamble to the question.

00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:00.816
So he's just explaining something.

00:10:00.840 --> 00:10:02.896
Remember, it's a question
about JavaScript.

00:10:02.920 --> 00:10:05.536
[At often, the goat-time
install a error is vomit.]

00:10:05.560 --> 00:10:10.656
(Laughter)

00:10:10.680 --> 00:10:14.216
Then comes the first part of the question.

00:10:14.240 --> 00:10:17.176
[How many times like the wind,
a pole, and the dragon?]

00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:21.856
(Laughter)

00:10:21.880 --> 00:10:23.936
Then comes my favorite part
of the question.

00:10:23.960 --> 00:10:25.896
[This insult to father's stones?]

00:10:25.920 --> 00:10:29.776
(Laughter)

00:10:29.800 --> 00:10:31.096
And then comes the ending,

00:10:31.120 --> 00:10:33.256
which is my favorite part
of the whole thing.

00:10:33.280 --> 00:10:36.416
[Please apologize for your stupidity.
There are a many thank you.]

00:10:36.440 --> 00:10:38.616
(Laughter)

00:10:38.640 --> 00:10:41.576
OK, so computer translation,
not yet good enough.

00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:42.856
So back to the question.

00:10:42.880 --> 00:10:45.856
So we need people
to translate the whole web.

00:10:45.880 --> 00:10:47.856
So now the next question you may have is,

00:10:47.880 --> 00:10:50.056
well, why can't we just
pay people to do this?

00:10:50.080 --> 00:10:53.176
We could pay professional translators
to translate the whole web.

00:10:53.200 --> 00:10:54.456
We could do that.

00:10:54.480 --> 00:10:56.696
Unfortunately, it would be
extremely expensive.

00:10:56.720 --> 00:10:59.976
For example, translating a tiny fraction
of the whole web, Wikipedia,

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.496
into one other language, Spanish.

00:11:02.520 --> 00:11:04.496
OK? Wikipedia exists in Spanish,

00:11:04.520 --> 00:11:06.976
but it's very small
compared to the size of English.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.176
It's about 20 percent
of the size of English.

00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:12.056
If we wanted to translate
the other 80 percent into Spanish,

00:11:12.080 --> 00:11:14.216
it would cost at least
50 million dollars --

00:11:14.240 --> 00:11:17.896
and this is even at the most exploited,
outsourcing country out there.

00:11:17.920 --> 00:11:19.376
So it would be very expensive.

00:11:19.400 --> 00:11:22.162
So what we want to do is,
we want to get 100 million people

00:11:22.186 --> 00:11:24.776
translating the web
into every major language for free.

00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:27.216
If this is what you want to do,
you quickly realize

00:11:27.240 --> 00:11:30.176
you're going to run
into two big hurdles, two big obstacles.

00:11:30.200 --> 00:11:33.496
The first one is a lack of bilinguals.

00:11:33.520 --> 00:11:35.696
So I don't even know

00:11:35.720 --> 00:11:38.456
if there exists 100 million people
out there using the web

00:11:38.480 --> 00:11:40.776
who are bilingual enough
to help us translate.

00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:42.016
That's a big problem.

00:11:42.040 --> 00:11:45.216
The other problem you're going to run into
is a lack of motivation.

00:11:45.240 --> 00:11:48.776
How are we going to motivate people
to actually translate the web for free?

00:11:48.800 --> 00:11:51.096
Normally, you have to pay
people to do this.

00:11:51.120 --> 00:11:53.736
So how are we going to motivate them
to do it for free?

00:11:53.760 --> 00:11:57.496
When we were starting to think about this,
we were blocked by these two things.

00:11:57.520 --> 00:11:59.216
But then we realized, there's a way

00:11:59.240 --> 00:12:01.696
to solve both these problems
with the same solution.

00:12:01.720 --> 00:12:03.336
To kill two birds with one stone.

00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:05.496
And that is to transform
language translation

00:12:05.520 --> 00:12:08.336
into something that millions
of people want to do

00:12:08.360 --> 00:12:11.496
and that also helps
with the problem of lack of bilinguals,

00:12:11.520 --> 00:12:13.896
and that is language education.

00:12:13.920 --> 00:12:15.896
So it turns out that today,

00:12:15.920 --> 00:12:19.320
there are over 1.2 billion people
learning a foreign language.

00:12:20.040 --> 00:12:22.256
People really want
to learn a foreign language.

00:12:22.280 --> 00:12:25.416
And it's not just because
they're being forced to do so in school.

00:12:25.440 --> 00:12:27.856
In the US alone,
there are over five million people

00:12:27.880 --> 00:12:30.776
who have paid over $500
for software to learn a new language.

00:12:30.800 --> 00:12:32.976
So people really want
to learn a new language.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:35.736
So what we've been working on
for the last year and a half

00:12:35.760 --> 00:12:37.816
is a new website --
it's called Duolingo --

00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:40.696
where the basic idea is
people learn a new language for free

00:12:40.720 --> 00:12:42.776
while simultaneously translating the web.

00:12:42.800 --> 00:12:45.336
And so basically,
they're learning by doing.

00:12:45.360 --> 00:12:46.576
So the way this works

00:12:46.600 --> 00:12:50.016
is whenever you're a just a beginner,
we give you very simple sentences.

00:12:50.040 --> 00:12:52.416
There's a lot of very simple
sentences on the web.

00:12:52.440 --> 00:12:55.656
We give you very simple sentences
along with what each word means.

00:12:55.680 --> 00:12:57.016
And as you translate them

00:12:57.040 --> 00:12:59.256
and as you see how other people
translate them,

00:12:59.280 --> 00:13:00.856
you start learning the language.

00:13:00.880 --> 00:13:02.296
And as you get more advanced,

00:13:02.320 --> 00:13:04.576
we give you more complex
sentences to translate.

00:13:04.600 --> 00:13:06.616
But at all times,
you're learning by doing.

00:13:06.640 --> 00:13:10.336
Now, the crazy thing about this method
is that it actually really works.

00:13:10.360 --> 00:13:12.216
People are really learning a language.

00:13:12.240 --> 00:13:14.856
We're mostly done building it
and now we're testing it.

00:13:14.880 --> 00:13:16.936
People really can
learn a language with it.

00:13:16.960 --> 00:13:20.456
And they learn it about as well
as the leading language learning software.

00:13:20.480 --> 00:13:22.296
So people really do learn a language.

00:13:22.320 --> 00:13:25.816
And not only do they learn it as well,
but actually it's more interesting.

00:13:25.840 --> 00:13:28.736
Because with Duolingo,
people are learning with real content.

00:13:28.760 --> 00:13:30.936
As opposed to learning
with made-up sentences,

00:13:30.960 --> 00:13:34.296
people are learning with real content,
which is inherently interesting.

00:13:34.320 --> 00:13:36.136
So people really do learn a language.

00:13:36.160 --> 00:13:37.776
But perhaps more surprisingly,

00:13:37.800 --> 00:13:40.536
the translations that we get
from people using the site,

00:13:40.560 --> 00:13:42.336
even though they're just beginners,

00:13:42.360 --> 00:13:43.736
the translations that we get

00:13:43.760 --> 00:13:46.696
are as accurate as those
of professional language translators,

00:13:46.720 --> 00:13:47.936
which is very surprising.

00:13:47.960 --> 00:13:49.496
So let me show you one example.

00:13:49.520 --> 00:13:52.536
This is a sentence that was translated
from German into English.

00:13:52.560 --> 00:13:55.336
The top is the German.
The middle is an English translation

00:13:55.360 --> 00:13:57.616
that was done by a professional translator

00:13:57.640 --> 00:14:00.016
who we paid 20 cents a word
for this translation.

00:14:00.040 --> 00:14:02.736
And the bottom is a translation
by users of Duolingo,

00:14:02.760 --> 00:14:06.496
none of whom knew any German
before they started using the site.

00:14:06.520 --> 00:14:08.496
If you can see, it's pretty much perfect.

00:14:08.520 --> 00:14:10.056
Of course, we play a trick here

00:14:10.080 --> 00:14:13.416
to make the translations as good
as professional language translators.

00:14:13.440 --> 00:14:15.776
We combine the translations
of multiple beginners

00:14:15.800 --> 00:14:18.696
to get the quality
of a single professional translator.

00:14:18.720 --> 00:14:23.256
Now, even though
we're combining the translations,

00:14:23.280 --> 00:14:26.056
the site actually
can translate pretty fast.

00:14:26.080 --> 00:14:27.296
So let me show you,

00:14:27.320 --> 00:14:30.256
this is our estimates
of how fast we could translate Wikipedia

00:14:30.280 --> 00:14:31.576
from English into Spanish.

00:14:31.600 --> 00:14:34.576
Remember, this is
50 million dollars' worth of value.

00:14:34.600 --> 00:14:37.056
So if we wanted to translate
Wikipedia into Spanish,

00:14:37.080 --> 00:14:39.776
we could do it in five weeks
with 100,000 active users.

00:14:39.800 --> 00:14:42.856
And we could do it in about 80 hours
with a million active users.

00:14:42.880 --> 00:14:45.336
Since all the projects
my group has worked on so far

00:14:45.360 --> 00:14:46.816
have gotten millions of users,

00:14:46.840 --> 00:14:49.736
we're hopeful that we'll be able
to translate extremely fast.

00:14:49.760 --> 00:14:52.736
Now, the thing that
I'm most excited about with Duolingo

00:14:52.760 --> 00:14:56.496
is I think this provides a fair
business model for language education.

00:14:56.520 --> 00:14:57.736
So here's the thing:

00:14:57.760 --> 00:15:00.096
The current business model
for language education

00:15:00.120 --> 00:15:01.496
is the student pays,

00:15:01.520 --> 00:15:04.576
and in particular, the student
pays Rosetta Stone 500 dollars.

00:15:04.600 --> 00:15:06.416
(Laughter)

00:15:06.440 --> 00:15:08.096
That's the current business model.

00:15:08.120 --> 00:15:09.856
The problem with this business model

00:15:09.880 --> 00:15:13.176
is that 95 percent of the world's
population doesn't have 500 dollars.

00:15:13.200 --> 00:15:15.976
So it's extremely unfair towards the poor.

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:17.936
This is totally biased towards the rich.

00:15:17.960 --> 00:15:19.576
Now, see, in Duolingo,

00:15:19.600 --> 00:15:23.256
because while you learn,
you're actually creating value,

00:15:23.280 --> 00:15:24.616
you're translating stuff --

00:15:24.640 --> 00:15:27.576
which, for example, we could
charge somebody for translations,

00:15:27.600 --> 00:15:29.456
so this is how we could monetize this.

00:15:29.480 --> 00:15:32.096
Since people are creating value
while they're learning,

00:15:32.120 --> 00:15:35.216
they don't have to pay with their money,
they pay with their time.

00:15:35.240 --> 00:15:37.163
But the magical thing here

00:15:37.187 --> 00:15:40.183
is that is time that would have had
to have been spent anyways

00:15:40.207 --> 00:15:41.416
learning the language.

00:15:41.440 --> 00:15:43.016
So the nice thing about Duolingo

00:15:43.040 --> 00:15:45.376
is, I think, it provides
a fair business model --

00:15:45.400 --> 00:15:47.776
one that doesn't discriminate
against poor people.

00:15:47.800 --> 00:15:49.256
So here's the site. Thank you.

00:15:49.280 --> 00:15:56.280
(Applause)

00:15:57.800 --> 00:16:00.216
We haven't yet launched,

00:16:00.240 --> 00:16:03.536
but if you go there, you can sign up
to be part of our private beta,

00:16:03.560 --> 00:16:06.216
which is probably going to start
in three or four weeks.

00:16:06.240 --> 00:16:07.576
We haven't yet launched it.

00:16:07.600 --> 00:16:09.416
By the way, I'm the one talking here,

00:16:09.440 --> 00:16:11.816
but Duolingo is the work
of a really awesome team,

00:16:11.840 --> 00:16:13.576
some of whom are here. So thank you.

00:16:13.600 --> 00:16:18.840
(Applause)
