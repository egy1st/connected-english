00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.000
I'm here to spread the word about the

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
magnificence of spiders

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
and how much we can learn from them.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Spiders are truly global citizens.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
You can find spiders in nearly

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
every terrestrial habitat.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
This red dot marks

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
the Great Basin of North America,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
and I'm involved with an alpine biodiversity

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
project there with some collaborators.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Here's one of our field sites,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
and just to give you a sense of perspective,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
this little blue smudge here,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
that's one of my collaborators.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
This is a rugged and barren landscape,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
yet there are quite a few spiders here.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Turning rocks over revealed this crab spider

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
grappling with a beetle.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
Spiders are not just everywhere,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
but they're extremely diverse.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
There are over 40,000 described species

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.000
of spiders.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
To put that number into perspective,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
here's a graph comparing the 40,000

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
species of spiders

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
to the 400 species of primates.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
There are two orders of magnitude more

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
spiders than primates.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.000
Spiders are also extremely old.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
On the bottom here,

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
this is the geologic timescale,

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
and the numbers on it indicate millions

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
of years from the present, so the zero here,

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
that would be today.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
So what this figure shows is that spiders

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.000
date back to almost 380 million years.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
To put that into perspective, this red

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
vertical bar here marks the divergence time

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
of humans from chimpanzees,

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
a mere seven million years ago.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
All spiders make silk

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
at some point in their life.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
Most spiders use copious amounts of silk,

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
and silk is essential to their survival

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
and reproduction.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
Even fossil spiders can make silk,

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
as we can see from this impression of

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000
a spinneret on this fossil spider.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
So this means that both spiders

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
and spider silk have been around

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000
for 380 million years.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
It doesn't take long from working with spiders

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
to start noticing how essential silk is

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
to just about every aspect of their life.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
Spiders use silk for many purposes, including

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
the trailing safety dragline,

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
wrapping eggs for reproduction,

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
protective retreats

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
and catching prey.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
There are many kinds of spider silk.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
For example, this garden spider can make

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
seven different kinds of silks.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
When you look at this orb web, you're actually

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000
seeing many types of silk fibers.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
The frame and radii of this web

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
is made up of one type of silk,

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
while the capture spiral is a composite

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
of two different silks:

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000
the filament and the sticky droplet.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000
How does an individual spider

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000
make so many kinds of silk?

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
To answer that, you have to look a lot closer

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
at the spinneret region of a spider.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
So silk comes out of the spinnerets, and for

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
those of us spider silk biologists, this is what

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
we call the "business end" of the spider. (Laughter)

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
We spend long days ...

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
Hey! Don't laugh. That's my life.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
(Laughter)

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
We spend long days and nights

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000
staring at this part of the spider.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
And this is what we see.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
You can see multiple fibers

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000
coming out of the spinnerets, because

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.000
each spinneret has many spigots on it.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.000
Each of these silk fibers exits from the spigot,

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
and if you were to trace the fiber back

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.000
into the spider, what you would find is that

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000
each spigot connects to its own individual

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000
silk gland. A silk gland kind of looks like a sac

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000
with a lot of silk proteins stuck inside.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000
So if you ever have the opportunity to dissect

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000
an orb-web-weaving spider,

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000
and I hope you do,

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000
what you would find is a bounty

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.000
of beautiful, translucent silk glands.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000
Inside each spider, there are hundreds

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.000
of silk glands, sometimes thousands.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.000
These can be grouped into seven categories.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
They differ by size, shape,

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000
and sometimes even color.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000
In an orb-web-weaving spider,

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000
you can find seven types of silk glands,

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000
and what I have depicted here in this picture,

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000
let's start at the one o'clock position,

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000
there's tubuliform silk glands, which are used

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000
to make the outer silk of an egg sac.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000
There's the aggregate and flagelliform silk

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000
glands which combine to make the sticky

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.000
capture spiral of an orb web.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.000
Pyriform silk glands make the attachment

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.000
cement -- that's the silk that's used to adhere

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000
silk lines to a substrate.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000
There's also aciniform silk,

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000
which is used to wrap prey.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000
Minor ampullate silk is used in web construction.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000
And the most studied silk line

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000
of them all: major ampullate silk.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000
This is the silk that's used to make the frame

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.000
and radii of an orb web, and also

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.000
the safety trailing dragline.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.000
But what, exactly, is spider silk?

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.000
Spider silk is almost entirely protein.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000
Nearly all of these proteins can be explained

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.000
by a single gene family,

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000
so this means that the diversity of silk types

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:08.000
we see today is encoded by one gene family,

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.000
so presumably the original spider ancestor

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000
made one kind of silk,

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.000
and over the last 380 million years,

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.000
that one silk gene has duplicated

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.000
and then diverged, specialized,

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.000
over and over and over again, to get

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000
the large variety of flavors of spider silks

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000
that we have today.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000
There are several features that all these silks

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.000
have in common. They all have a common

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000
design, such as they're all very long --

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.000
they're sort of outlandishly long

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000
compared to other proteins.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.000
They're very repetitive, and they're very rich

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.000
in the amino acids glycine and alanine.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.000
To give you an idea of what

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000
a spider silk protein looks like,

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000
this is a dragline silk protein,

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.000
it's just a portion of it,

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000
from the black widow spider.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.000
This is the kind of sequence that I love

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.000
looking at day and night. (Laughter)

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.000
So what you're seeing here is the one letter

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.000
abbreviation for amino acids, and I've colored

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000
in the glycines with green,

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000
and the alanines in red, and so

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.000
you can see it's just a lot of G's and A's.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.000
You can also see that there's a lot of short

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.000
sequence motifs that repeat over and over

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.000
and over again, so for example there's a lot of

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.000
what we call polyalanines, or iterated A's,

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:28.000
AAAAA. There's GGQ. There's GGY.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000
You can think of these short motifs

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.000
that repeat over and over again as words,

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.000
and these words occur in sentences.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.000
So for example this would be one sentence,

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.000
and you would get this sort of green region

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.000
and the red polyalanine, that repeats

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.000
over and over and over again,

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000
and you can have that hundreds and

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000
hundreds and hundreds of times within

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000
an individual silk molecule.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000
Silks made by the same spider can have

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.000
dramatically different repeat sequences.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.000
At the top of the screen, you're seeing

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.000
the repeat unit from the dragline silk

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.000
of a garden argiope spider.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.000
It's short. And on the bottom,

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000
this is the repeat sequence for the

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000
egg case, or tubuliform silk protein,

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.000
for the exact same spider. And you can see

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.000
how dramatically different

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:19.000
these silk proteins are -- so this is

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.000
sort of the beauty of the diversification

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.000
of the spider silk gene family.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.000
You can see that the repeat units differ

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.000
in length. They also differ in sequence.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000
So I've colored in the glycines again

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:32.000
in green, alanine in red, and the serines,

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.000
the letter S, in purple. And you can see

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.000
that the top repeat unit can be explained

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:40.000
almost entirely by green and red,

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.000
and the bottom repeat unit has

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.000
a substantial amount of purple.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:47.000
What silk biologists do is we try to relate

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.000
these sequences, these amino acid

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.000
sequences, to the mechanical properties

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.000
of the silk fibers.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:56.000
Now, it's really convenient that spiders use their silk

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.000
completely outside their body.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000
This makes testing spider silk really, really

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000
easy to do in the laboratory, because

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:05.000
we're actually, you know, testing it in air

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.000
that's exactly the environment that

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.000
spiders are using their silk proteins.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.000
So this makes quantifying silk properties by

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.000
methods such as tensile testing, which is

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.000
basically, you know, tugging on one end

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.000
of the fiber, very amenable.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:21.000
Here are stress-strain curves

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.000
generated by tensile testing

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:26.000
five fibers made by the same spider.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:29.000
So what you can see here is that

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:32.000
the five fibers have different behaviors.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.000
Specifically, if you look on the vertical axis,

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:37.000
that's stress. If you look at the maximum

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.000
stress value for each of these fibers,

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.000
you can see that there's a lot of variation,

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.000
and in fact dragline, or major ampullate silk,

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.000
is the strongest of these fibers.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:50.000
We think that's because the dragline silk,

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:53.000
which is used to make the frame and radii

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.000
for a web, needs to be very strong.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.000
On the other hand, if you were to look at

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.000
strain -- this is how much a fiber can be

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.000
extended -- if you look at the maximum value

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:04.000
here, again, there's a lot of variation

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.000
and the clear winner is flagelliform,

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.000
or the capture spiral filament.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.000
In fact, this flagelliform fiber can

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:14.000
actually stretch over twice its original length.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:17.000
So silk fibers vary in their strength

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.000
and also their extensibility.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.000
In the case of the capture spiral,

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.000
it needs to be so stretchy to absorb

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.000
the impact of flying prey.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.000
If it wasn't able to stretch so much, then

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.000
basically when an insect hit the web,

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.000
it would just trampoline right off of it.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.000
So if the web was made entirely out of

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:36.000
dragline silk, an insect is very likely to just

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.000
bounce right off. But by having really, really

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.000
stretchy capture spiral silk, the web is actually

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.000
able to absorb the impact

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.000
of that intercepted prey.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.000
There's quite a bit of variation within

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:50.000
the fibers that an individual spider can make.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:53.000
We call that the tool kit of a spider.

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.000
That's what the spider has

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.000
to interact with their environment.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.000
But how about variation among spider

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.000
species, so looking at one type of silk

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:04.000
and looking at different species of spiders?

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.000
This is an area that's largely unexplored

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:10.000
but here's a little bit of data I can show you.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.000
This is the comparison of the toughness

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.000
of the dragline spilk spun

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.000
by 21 species of spiders.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.000
Some of them are orb-weaving spiders and

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:21.000
some of them are non-orb-weaving spiders.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.000
It's been hypothesized that

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:26.000
orb-weaving spiders, like this argiope here,

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.000
should have the toughest dragline silks

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:31.000
because they must intercept flying prey.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:34.000
What you see here on this toughness graph

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.000
is the higher the black dot is on the graph,

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.000
the higher the toughness.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:41.000
The 21 species are indicated here by this

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:44.000
phylogeny, this evolutionary tree, that shows

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.000
their genetic relationships, and I've colored

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:49.000
in yellow the orb-web-weaving spiders.

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:52.000
If you look right here at the two red arrows,

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:55.000
they point to the toughness values

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.000
for the draglines of nephila clavipes and

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.000
araneus diadematus.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.000
These are the two species of spiders

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:04.000
for which the vast majority of time and money

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:07.000
on synthetic spider silk research has been

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:10.000
to replicate their dragline silk proteins.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:14.000
Yet, their draglines are not the toughest.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:17.000
In fact, the toughest dragline in this survey

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:20.000
is this one right here in this white region,

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.000
a non orb-web-weaving spider.

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.000
This is the dragline spun by scytodes,

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.000
the spitting spider.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:29.000
Scytodes doesn't use a web at all

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.000
to catch prey. Instead, scytodes

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:34.000
sort of lurks around and waits for prey

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:37.000
to get close to it, and then immobilizes prey

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:41.000
by spraying a silk-like venom onto that insect.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:44.000
Think of hunting with silly string.

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:47.000
That's how scytodes forages.

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.000
We don't really know why scytodes

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:52.000
needs such a tough dragline,

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:55.000
but it's unexpected results like this that make

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:59.000
bio-prospecting so exciting and worthwhile.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.000
It frees us from the constraints

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.000
of our imagination.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:05.000
Now I'm going to mark on

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:08.000
the toughness values for nylon fiber,

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:11.000
bombyx -- or domesticated silkworm silk --

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:14.000
wool, Kevlar, and carbon fibers.

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.000
And what you can see is that nearly

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.000
all the spider draglines surpass them.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:22.000
It's the combination of strength, extensibility

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:25.000
and toughness that makes spider silk so

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:28.000
special, and that has attracted the attention

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:31.000
of biomimeticists, so people that turn

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:34.000
to nature to try to find new solutions.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:37.000
And the strength, extensibility and toughness

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:40.000
of spider silks combined with the fact that

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:43.000
silks do not elicit an immune response,

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:46.000
have attracted a lot of interest in the use

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.000
of spider silks in biomedical applications,

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.000
for example, as a component of

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:53.000
artificial tendons, for serving as

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:57.000
guides to regrow nerves, and for

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:00.000
scaffolds for tissue growth.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:03.000
Spider silks also have a lot of potential

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:05.000
for their anti-ballistic capabilities.

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:07.000
Silks could be incorporated into body

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:10.000
and equipment armor that would be more

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.000
lightweight and flexible

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:15.000
than any armor available today.

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:18.000
In addition to these biomimetic

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:20.000
applications of spider silks,

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:24.000
personally, I find studying spider silks

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:27.000
just fascinating in and of itself.

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:31.000
I love when I'm in the laboratory,

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:34.000
a new spider silk sequence comes in.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:37.000
That's just the best. (Laughter)

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:40.000
It's like the spiders are sharing

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:42.000
an ancient secret with me, and that's why

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.000
I'm going to spend the rest of my life

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:46.000
studying spider silk.

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:49.000
The next time you see a spider web,

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:52.000
please, pause and look a little closer.

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:54.000
You'll be seeing one of the most

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:57.000
high-performance materials known to man.

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:59.000
To borrow from the writings

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:02.000
of a spider named Charlotte,

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.000
silk is terrific.

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:07.000
Thank you. (Applause)

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:08.000
(Applause)
