00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Over the last 13 years --

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
one, three, 13 years --

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
I've been part of an exceptional team at InSightec in Israel

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
and partners around the world

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
for taking this idea, this concept,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
noninvasive surgery,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
from the research lab to routine clinical use.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
And this is what I'll tell you about.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
13 years --

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
for some of you, you can empathize with that number.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
For me, today, on this date,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
it's like a second bar mitzvah experience.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
(Laughter)

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
So this dream

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
is really enabled

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
by the convergence

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
of two known technologies.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
One is the focused ultrasound,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
and the other one is the

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
vision-enabled magnetic resonance imaging.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
So let's first talk about focused ultrasound.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
And I hold in my hand

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
a tissue-mimicking phantom.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
It is made out of silicon.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
It is transparent, made just for you.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
So you see, it's all intact,

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
completely transparent.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
I'll take you now to the acoustic lab.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
You see the phantom within the aquarium.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
This is a setup I put in a physics lab.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
On the right-hand side,

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
you see an ultrasonic transducer.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
So the ultrasonic transducer

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
emits basically an ultrasonic beam

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
that focuses inside the phantom.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.000
Okay, when you hear the click,

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
this is when the energy starts to emit

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
and you see a little lesion form

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
inside the phantom.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
Okay, so everything around it

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
is whole and intact.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
It's just a lesion formed inside.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
So think about, this is in your brain.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
We need to reach a target inside the brain.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
We can do it without harming any tissue.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
So this is, I think,

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
the first kosher Hippocratic surgical system.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
(Laughter)

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
Okay, so let's talk a little bit about ultrasound,

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
the force of ultrasound.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
You know all about imaging, right, ultrasound imaging.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000
And you know also about lithotripsy --

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000
breaking kidney stones.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000
But ultrasound can be shaped

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000
to be anything in between,

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000
because it's a mechanical force.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
Basically, it's a force acting on a tissue

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
that it transverses.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
So you can change the intensity, the frequency,

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
the duration, the pulse shape of the ultrasound

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
to create anything

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000
from an airbrush to a hammer.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
And I am going to show you

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
multiple applications in the medical field

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
that can be enabled

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
just by focusing,

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000
physically focusing.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
So this idea

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
of harnessing focused ultrasound to treat lesions in the brain

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
is not new at all.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000
When I was born, this idea was already conceived

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000
by pioneers such as the Fry brothers

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
and Lars Leksell,

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000
who is know actually

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000
as the inventor of the gammaknife.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000
But you may not know

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
that he tried to perform lobotomies in the brain,

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
noninvasively,

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000
with focused ultrasound in the '50s.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
He failed,

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000
so he then invented the gammaknife.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000
And it makes you ponder

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.000
why those pioneers failed.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
And there was something fundamental

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000
that they were missing.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
They were missing the vision.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.000
It wasn't until the invention of the MR

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000
and really the integration of MR

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000
with focused ultrasound

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.000
that we could get the feedback --

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.000
both the anatomical and the physiological

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.000
in order to have a completely noninvasive, closed-loop

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.000
surgical procedure.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000
So this is how it looks, you know,

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.000
the operating room of the future today.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.000
This is an MR suite with a focused ultrasound system.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
And I will give you several examples.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000
So the first one is in the brain.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000
One of the neurological conditions

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000
that can be treated with focused ultrasound

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000
are movement disorders,

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.000
like Parkinson's or essential tremor.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.000
What is typical to those conditions,

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.000
to essential tremor for example,

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.000
is inability

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.000
to drink or eat cereal or soup

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.000
without spilling everything all over you,

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.000
or write legibly so people can understand it,

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.000
and be really independent in your life

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000
without the help of others.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.000
So I'd like you to meet John.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000
John is a retired professor of history

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000
from Virginia.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.000
So he suffered from essential tremor for many years.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:51.000
And medication didn't help him anymore.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000
And many of those patients refused to undergo surgery

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000
to have people cut into their brain.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.000
And about four or five months ago,

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:04.000
he underwent an experimental procedure.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.000
It is approved under an FDAIDE

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000
at the University of Virginia

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000
in Charlottesville

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000
using focused ultrasound

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.000
to ablate a point in his thalamus.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.000
And this is his handwriting.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.000
"On June 20th," if you can read it,

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.000
"2011."

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000
This is his handwriting

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000
on the morning of the treatment

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.000
before going into the MR

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.000
So now I'll take you through

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.000
[what] a typical procedure like that looks like,

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.000
[what] noninvasive surgery looks like.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.000
So we put the patient on the MR table.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000
We attach a transducer, in this case, to the brain,

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.000
but if it will be a different organ,

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:52.000
it will be a different transducer attached to the patient.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.000
And the physician

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.000
will then take a regular MR scan.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.000
And the objective of that?

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000
I don't have a pointer here,

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:06.000
but you see the green, sort of rectangle or trapezoid?

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000
This is the sort of general area of the treatment.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000
It's a safety boundary

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000
around the target.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000
It's a target in the thalamus.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.000
So once those pictures are acquired

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.000
and the physician has drawn

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.000
all the necessary safety limits and so on,

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000
he selects basically a point --

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.000
you see the round point in the middle where the cursor is --

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.000
and he presses this blue button called "sonicate."

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.000
We call this instance of injecting the energy,

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.000
we call it sonication.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.000
The only handwork the physician does here

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.000
is moving a mouse.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:43.000
This is the only device he needs in this treatment.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:46.000
So he presses "sonicate," and this is what happens.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.000
You see the transducer, the light blue.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.000
There's water in between the skull and the transducer.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000
And it does this burst of energy.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000
It elevates the temperature.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.000
We first need to verify

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.000
that we are on target.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000
So the first sonication

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.000
is at lower energy.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.000
It doesn't do any damage,

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.000
but it elevates the temperature

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000
by a few degrees.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000
And one of the unique capabilities

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.000
that we leverage with the MR

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:17.000
is the ability to measure temperature noninvasively.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.000
This is really a unique capability of the MR.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.000
It is not being used

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.000
in regular diagnostic imaging.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.000
But here we can get

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.000
both the anatomical imaging and the temperature maps in real time.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:32.000
And you can see the points there on the graph.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.000
The temperature was raised

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000
to 43 degrees C temporarily.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.000
This doesn't cause any damage.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.000
But the point is we are right on target.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.000
So once the physician verifies

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:46.000
that the focus spot is on the target he has chosen,

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:49.000
then we move to perform

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.000
a full-energy ablation

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.000
like you see here.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:56.000
And you see the temperature rises

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.000
to like 55 to 60 degrees C.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000
If you do it for more than a second,

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.000
it's enough to basically destroy

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.000
the proteins of the cells.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.000
This is the outcome from a patient perspective --

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:12.000
same day after the treatment.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.000
This is an immediate relief.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:19.000
(Applause)

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.000
Thank you.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:24.000
John is one of [about] a dozen

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:28.000
very heroic, courageous people

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.000
who volunteered for the study.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000
And you have to understand

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.000
what is in people's mind

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:37.000
when they are willing to take the risk.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:40.000
And this is a quote from John after he wrote it.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000
He said, "Miraculous."

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:46.000
And his wife said, "This is the happiest moment of my life."

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.000
And you wonder why.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.000
I mean, one of the messages I like to carry over

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:54.000
is, what about defending quality of life?

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.000
I mean, those people lose their independence.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.000
They are dependent on others.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:01.000
And John today is fully independent.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:04.000
He returned to a normal life routine.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.000
And he also plays golf,

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.000
like you do in Virginia

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:12.000
when you are retired.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:17.000
Okay, so you can see here the spot.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.000
It's like three millimeters in the middle of the brain.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.000
There's no damage outside.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:24.000
He suffers from no neurodeficit.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:27.000
There's no recovery needed, no nothing.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.000
He's back to his normal life.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.000
Let's move now

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.000
to a more painful subject.

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.000
Pain is something

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.000
that can make your life miserable.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.000
And people are suffering from all kinds of pain

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:43.000
like neuropathic pain, lower-back pain

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:46.000
and cancer pain from bone metastases,

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:49.000
when the metastases get to your bones,

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:52.000
sometimes they are very painful.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.000
All those I've indicated

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.000
have already been shown

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.000
to be successfully treated

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:01.000
by focused ultrasound

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:04.000
relieving the pain, again, very fast.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.000
And I would like to tell you

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:10.000
about PJ.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:14.000
He's a 78 year-old farmer

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:17.000
who suffered from -- how should I say it? --

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.000
it's called pain in the butt.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:22.000
He had metastases in his right buttock,

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.000
and he couldn't sit

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.000
even with medication.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:30.000
He had to forgo all the farm activities.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.000
He was treated with radiation therapy,

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.000
state-of-the-art radiation therapy,

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.000
but it didn't help.

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:42.000
Many patients like that favor radiation therapy.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.000
And again, he volunteered

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.000
to a pivotal study

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:49.000
that we ran worldwide,

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:52.000
also in the U.S.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:56.000
And his wife actually took him.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.000
They drove like three hours

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:01.000
from their farm to the hospital.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:04.000
He had to sit on a cushion,

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:06.000
stand still, not move,

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:09.000
because it was very painful.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.000
He took the treatment,

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:14.000
and on the way back,

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:18.000
he drove the truck by himself.

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:21.000
So again, this is an immediate relief.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.000
And you have to understand

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.000
what those people feel

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:28.000
and what their family experiences

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.000
when it happens.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.000
He returned again

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.000
to his daily routine on the farm.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.000
He rides his tractor.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:40.000
He rides his horse to their mountain cabin regularly.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:43.000
And he has been very happy.

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:46.000
But now, you ask me,

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.000
but what about war, the war on cancer?

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:51.000
Show us some primary cancer.

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.000
What can be done there?

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.000
So I have good news and bad news.

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:58.000
The good news: there's a lot that can be done.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:01.000
And it has been shown actually outside of the U.S.

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:05.000
And doing that in the U.S.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:07.000
is very painful.

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:11.000
I don't see, without this nation

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:15.000
taking it as some collective will

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:18.000
or something that is a national goal to make that happen,

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.000
it will not happen.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.000
And it's not just because of regulation;

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:25.000
it's because of the amount of money needed

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:29.000
under the current evidence-based medicine

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:31.000
and the size of trials and so on

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:33.000
to make it happen.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:35.000
So the first two applications

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:38.000
are breast cancer and prostate cancer.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:41.000
They were the first to be treated by focused ultrasound.

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:46.000
And we have better-than-surgery results in breasts.

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.000
But I have a message for the men here.

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:51.000
We heard here yesterday Quyen

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:54.000
talking about the adverse event trait

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.000
in prostate cancer.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.000
There is a unique opportunity now

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:01.000
with focused ultrasound guided by MR,

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:04.000
because we can actually think about

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:06.000
prostate lumpectomy --

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.000
treating just the focal lesion

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:10.000
and not removing the whole gland,

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:13.000
and by that, avoiding all the issues

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:16.000
with potency and incontinence.

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:23.000
Well, there are other cancer tumors in the abdomen --

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:25.000
quite lethal, very lethal actually --

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:28.000
pancreas, liver, kidney.

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.000
The challenge there

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:33.000
with a breathing and awake patient --

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:35.000
and in all our treatments,

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:37.000
the patient is awake and conscious

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:41.000
and speaks with the physician --

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:44.000
is you have to teach the MR some tricks

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:47.000
how to do it in real time.

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:49.000
And this will take time.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:51.000
This will take two years.

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:54.000
But I have now a message to the ladies.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:57.000
And this is, in 2004,

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:00.000
the FDA has approved MR-guided focused ultrasounds

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:05.000
for the treatment of symptomatic uterine fibroids.

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:09.000
Women suffer from that disease.

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:11.000
All those tumors

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:13.000
have heavy bleeding during periods,

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:15.000
abdominal pressure, back pain,

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:17.000
frequent urination.

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:21.000
And sometimes, they cannot even conceive and become pregnant

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:23.000
because of the fibroid.

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:25.000
This is Frances.

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:27.000
She was diagnosed with a grapefruit-sized fibroid.

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:29.000
This is a big fibroid.

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:31.000
She was offered a hysterectomy,

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:33.000
but this is an inconceivable proposition

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:36.000
for someone who wants to keep her pregnancy option.

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:40.000
So she elected to undergo a focused ultrasound procedure

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.000
in 2008.

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:46.000
And in 2010, she became a first-time mother to a healthy baby.

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.000
So new life was born.

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:50.000
(Applause)

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:53.000
So in conclusion,

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:56.000
I'd like to leave you with actually four messages.

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:58.000
One is, think about the amount

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:00.000
of suffering that is saved

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:04.000
from patients undergoing noninvasive surgery,

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:08.000
and also the economical and emotional burden

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:11.000
removed from their families and communities

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:15.000
and the society at large --

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:21.000
and I think also from their physicians, by the way.

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:24.000
And the other thing I would like you to think about

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:27.000
is the new type of relationship

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:29.000
between physician and patients

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:32.000
when you have a patient on the table

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:35.000
[who] is awake and can even monitor the treatment.

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:37.000
In all our treatments,

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:39.000
the patient holds a stop sonication button.

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:43.000
He can stop the surgery at any moment.

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:46.000
And with that note,

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:49.000
I would like to thank you for listening.

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:52.000
(Applause)
