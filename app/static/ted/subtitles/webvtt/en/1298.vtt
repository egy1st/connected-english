00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Okay, I have no idea what we're going to play.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
I won't be able to tell you what it is until it happens.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
I didn't realize there was going to be a little music before.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
So I think I'm going to start with what I just heard.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:21.000
(Music)

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:55.000
(Applause)

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000
Okay, so first of all,

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.000
let's welcome Mr. Jamire Williams on the drums,

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000
(Applause)

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000
Burniss Travis on the bass,

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000
(Applause)

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.000
and Mr. Christian Sands on the piano.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.000
(Applause)

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000
So the bandstand, as we call it,

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000
this is an incredible space.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.000
It is really a sacred space.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.000
And one of the things that is really sacred about it

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.000
is that you have no opportunity to think about the future,

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000
or the past.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000
You really are alive right here in this moment.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000
There are so many decisions being made

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000
when you walk on the bandstand.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.000
We had no idea what key we were going to play in.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.000
In the middle, we sort of made our way

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000
into a song called "Titi Boom."

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.000
But that could have happened -- maybe, maybe not.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000
Everyone's listening. We're responding.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.000
You have no time for projected ideas.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:49.000
So the idea of a mistake:

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000
From the perspective of a jazz musician,

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.000
it's easier to talk about someone else's mistake.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.000
So the way I perceive a mistake when I'm on the bandstand --

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000
first of all, we don't really see it as a mistake.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.000
The only mistake lies

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.000
in that I'm not able to perceive

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.000
what it is that someone else did.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:10.000
Every "mistake" is an opportunity in jazz.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.000
So it's hard to even describe

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.000
what a funny note would be.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.000
So for example, if I played a color, like we were playing on a palette,

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.000
that sounded like this ...

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.000
(Music)

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.000
So if Christian played a note -- like play an F.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.000
(Music)

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.000
See, these are all right inside of the color palette.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:32.000
If you played an E.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.000
See, these all lie right inside

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000
of this general emotional palette that we were painting.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.000
If you played an F# though,

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:42.000
(Dissonance)

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:45.000
to most people's ears, they would perceive that as a mistake.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.000
So I'm going to show you, we're going to play just for a second.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.000
And we're going to play on this palette.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.000
And at some point, Christian will introduce this note.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.000
And we won't react to it.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.000
He'll introduce it for a second

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.000
and then I'll stop, I'll talk for a second.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.000
We'll see what happens when we play with this palette.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:09.000
(Music)

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:28.000
So someone could conceptually perceive that as a mistake.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.000
The only way that I would say it was a mistake

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000
is in that we didn't react to it.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.000
It was an opportunity that was missed.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:37.000
So it's unpredictable. We'll paint this palette again.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:40.000
He'll play it. I don't know how we'll react to it, but something will change.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000
We'll all accept his ideas,

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.000
or not.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:54.000
(Music)

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.000
So you see, he played this note.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.000
I ended up creating a melody out of it.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.000
The texture changed in the drums this time.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:02.000
It got a little bit more rhythmic, a little bit more intense

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.000
in response to how I responded to it.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.000
So there is no mistake.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.000
The only mistake is if I'm not aware,

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.000
if each individual musician is not aware

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:14.000
and accepting enough of his fellow band member

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:17.000
to incorporate the idea and we don't allow for creativity.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:21.000
So jazz, this bandstand is absolutely amazing.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.000
It's a very purifying experience.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:26.000
And I know that I speak for all of us when I tell you that we don't take it for granted.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:30.000
We know that to be able to come on the bandstand and play music is a blessing.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:33.000
So how does this all relate to behavioral finance?

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.000
Well we're jazz musicians,

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.000
so stereotypically we don't have a great relationship to finance.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:40.000
(Laughter)

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:43.000
Anyway, I just wanted to sort of point out the way that we handle it.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.000
And the other dynamic of it

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:48.000
is that we don't micromanage in jazz.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.000
You have some people who do.

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.000
But what that does

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:54.000
is it actually limits the artistic possibilities.

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:57.000
If I come up and I dictate to the band

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.000
that I want to play like this and I want the music to go this way,

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.000
and I just jump right in ...

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:03.000
ready, just play some time.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:05.000
One, two, one, two, three, four.

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:17.000
(Music)

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.000
It's kind of chaotic because I'm bullying my ideas.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.000
I'm telling them, "You come with me over this way."

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.000
If I really want the music to go there,

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.000
the best way for me to do it is to listen.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.000
This is a science of listening.

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.000
It has far more to do with what I can perceive

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.000
than what it is that I can do.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:34.000
So if I want the music to get to a certain level of intensity,

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.000
the first step for me is

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.000
to be patient, to listen to what's going on

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:41.000
and pull from something that's going on around me.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:44.000
When you do that, you engage and inspire the other musicians

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:46.000
and they give you more, and gradually it builds.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:49.000
Watch. One, two, a one, two, three, four.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:59.000
(Music)

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:32.000
Totally different experience when I'm pulling ideas.

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.000
It's much more organic. It's much more nuanced.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.000
It's not about bullying my vision or anything like that.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.000
It's about being here in the moment,

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.000
accepting one another

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:42.000
and allowing creativity to flow.

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:44.000
Thank you.

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:49.000
(Applause)
