00:00:01.442 --> 00:00:03.992
Hello everybody,
thanks for having me today.

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:05.865
I'm a little bit injured,

00:00:05.889 --> 00:00:09.181
but it takes more than a car
to stop me from talking to you.

00:00:09.205 --> 00:00:11.721
(Laughter)

00:00:11.745 --> 00:00:14.912
(Applause)

00:00:14.936 --> 00:00:16.208
Maybe a tank?

00:00:18.919 --> 00:00:22.020
So today, I want to talk
about the microprinter,

00:00:22.044 --> 00:00:24.838
about my work, how everything started,

00:00:24.862 --> 00:00:30.583
what was my motivation to build
the smallest 3-D printer in the world.

00:00:30.607 --> 00:00:33.926
Let's start with my daily business.

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:38.281
So, my normal working field is called
two-photon polymerization.

00:00:39.111 --> 00:00:42.369
It sounds very nerdy, it is very nerdy.

00:00:42.393 --> 00:00:43.712
(Laughter)

00:00:44.465 --> 00:00:47.801
What do you need for making this stuff?

00:00:47.825 --> 00:00:50.025
You need a complex laser system,

00:00:50.049 --> 00:00:52.367
a so-called femtosecond laser system,

00:00:52.391 --> 00:00:57.854
which you focus onto a very tiny spot --
very, very, very tiny --

00:00:57.878 --> 00:01:03.571
and this is a very expensive,
not very durable laser system. (Laughs)

00:01:04.264 --> 00:01:08.453
And on the other hand, you need
a very complex positioning system.

00:01:08.477 --> 00:01:12.064
We call it "Agathe,"
because it's very heavy,

00:01:12.088 --> 00:01:14.393
and we thought Agathe was a nice name.

00:01:14.417 --> 00:01:15.567
(Laughter)

00:01:16.757 --> 00:01:20.198
And, well, you need this system
to move the laser through,

00:01:20.222 --> 00:01:24.103
for example, at the very accurate
level, about 200 nanometers,

00:01:24.127 --> 00:01:25.286
so very accurate.

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:27.793
And, well, what can you do with that?

00:01:27.817 --> 00:01:31.124
You can do things
that you cannot see with your eyes.

00:01:31.148 --> 00:01:33.516
So you can print out whatever you want,

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:37.859
you can print out a tower bridge,
you can print out Agathe's husband ...

00:01:38.343 --> 00:01:40.311
(Laughter)

00:01:41.145 --> 00:01:47.210
OK, but, what makes it so mind-blowing?

00:01:47.234 --> 00:01:53.610
You maybe notice this scale bar,
and it's 100 microns for the tower bridge

00:01:53.634 --> 00:01:56.017
and 20 microns for the fat man.

00:01:56.041 --> 00:02:00.672
For comparison, the diameter
of a human hair is around 50 microns.

00:02:00.696 --> 00:02:05.954
So these objects are like
a dust particle or even smaller,

00:02:05.978 --> 00:02:08.738
so you can hardly see them.

00:02:09.551 --> 00:02:13.796
What you can also do
and what we are also working on

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:17.908
is improving the system,
improving the resins,

00:02:17.932 --> 00:02:23.537
the material we use for catching
a worm or something else.

00:02:23.561 --> 00:02:28.891
Inside the resin, we move the laser
through the resin, it gets polymerized,

00:02:28.915 --> 00:02:31.729
and we catch a living animal,

00:02:31.753 --> 00:02:33.447
here, a special worm.

00:02:33.471 --> 00:02:37.282
What we're trying to do,
or what the next step would be,

00:02:37.306 --> 00:02:43.874
is to make biocompatible polymers
and maybe to write some things

00:02:43.898 --> 00:02:47.150
inside your body
or inside the body of a worm,

00:02:47.174 --> 00:02:52.079
or to attach cells
to our structures, and so on.

00:02:52.103 --> 00:02:55.237
But, OK, that's my normal working field.

00:02:55.261 --> 00:02:59.679
Today I want to tell the story
behind the microprinter.

00:02:59.703 --> 00:03:01.438
What was my motivation?

00:03:01.462 --> 00:03:06.001
Well, everything started
on Monday morning, 6:30.

00:03:06.025 --> 00:03:09.223
OK, that's a lie. Maybe it was 10 o'clock.

00:03:09.247 --> 00:03:10.264
(Laughter)

00:03:10.288 --> 00:03:15.255
I went to my laser lab, which is located
near Karlsplatz, in Freihaus,

00:03:15.279 --> 00:03:17.709
at the Vienna University of Technology.

00:03:17.733 --> 00:03:21.697
I went in, and I saw
that this laser system was broken,

00:03:21.721 --> 00:03:23.044
and I tried to fix it.

00:03:23.068 --> 00:03:26.510
It took me half a day, several hours.

00:03:26.534 --> 00:03:30.814
Then I noticed, OK, there is a major
issue with the pump source.

00:03:30.838 --> 00:03:34.230
I cannot fix that myself; we have to call
the service technician.

00:03:34.254 --> 00:03:37.741
And from that point on,
I noticed I had time to think.

00:03:37.765 --> 00:03:42.122
So I thought, "What to do now?
Maybe start to write my PhD thesis."

00:03:42.146 --> 00:03:44.459
(Laughter)

00:03:44.483 --> 00:03:46.972
No, no, not a good idea at all.

00:03:46.996 --> 00:03:51.588
So I started thinking, maybe
write a scientific paper.

00:03:51.612 --> 00:03:53.144
Not a good idea at all.

00:03:53.168 --> 00:03:57.090
And then, on Saturday,
after a week of thinking,

00:03:57.114 --> 00:03:58.480
I came up with the idea

00:03:58.504 --> 00:04:01.624
to build the smallest
3-D microprinter in the world.

00:04:01.648 --> 00:04:03.023
(Laughter)

00:04:03.047 --> 00:04:05.322
Or, the smallest 3-D printer in the world.

00:04:05.346 --> 00:04:08.719
(Applause)

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:14.412
So I called my professor
and told him about it.

00:04:14.436 --> 00:04:17.169
"Hey, let's build the thing!
I have time. Is it OK?"

00:04:17.193 --> 00:04:18.352
"Go ahead, build it."

00:04:18.376 --> 00:04:21.813
And so I went to the university,
and from that point on,

00:04:21.837 --> 00:04:25.092
I just put everything out of my brain
inside the computer

00:04:25.116 --> 00:04:28.587
to make this CAD construction
of the whole thing.

00:04:28.611 --> 00:04:33.870
And after a few months,
we had the first test run with the system.

00:04:33.894 --> 00:04:38.195
It worked brilliantly
from the first test on,

00:04:38.219 --> 00:04:43.536
and it had the same resolution
as systems which cost 60,000 euros,

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:47.640
and we only spent 1,500 euros
for the system,

00:04:47.664 --> 00:04:51.620
not including my salary,

00:04:51.644 --> 00:04:54.355
but that wouldn't add so much on its own.

00:04:54.379 --> 00:04:55.797
(Laughter)

00:04:55.821 --> 00:04:57.639
OK, how does this work?

00:04:57.663 --> 00:04:59.164
I brought you a video

00:04:59.188 --> 00:05:04.053
where you can see how you can put
in your three-dimensional file.

00:05:04.077 --> 00:05:09.160
This video was produced
by a friend of mine, Junior Veloso.

00:05:09.184 --> 00:05:12.950
And you can see, you have
a set stage which moves up.

00:05:12.974 --> 00:05:15.483
And under the set stage,
there is a liquid,

00:05:15.507 --> 00:05:18.511
which gets solidified by the light.

00:05:18.535 --> 00:05:23.600
And slice by slice, you create the model,

00:05:23.624 --> 00:05:29.586
so you really pull it out of the liquid.

00:05:30.091 --> 00:05:33.601
And it just depends
on how big your model is.

00:05:33.625 --> 00:05:37.560
Maybe you have 100 slices,
1,000 or 10,000 slices.

00:05:37.584 --> 00:05:40.219
So that's how it works.

00:05:40.243 --> 00:05:43.542
Of course, this is a much bigger machine
than the microprinter,

00:05:43.566 --> 00:05:46.181
but it uses more or less
the same principles,

00:05:46.205 --> 00:05:48.425
so that's what I want to show you.

00:05:48.449 --> 00:05:51.721
At the end, this head, this alien head,

00:05:51.745 --> 00:05:53.906
is attached to the building platform,

00:05:53.930 --> 00:06:00.138
and when the process is done,
you just simply have to break the head

00:06:00.162 --> 00:06:02.900
from the support structure you need,

00:06:02.924 --> 00:06:05.038
and then everything is ready.

00:06:05.843 --> 00:06:07.233
So.

00:06:08.663 --> 00:06:11.958
OK, but what does
the microprinter look like?

00:06:11.982 --> 00:06:15.420
Well, maybe some of you
have already seen this picture.

00:06:15.444 --> 00:06:20.681
I also brought it to you in person,
so I want to kindly introduce you

00:06:20.705 --> 00:06:23.655
to the 3-D microprinter,
which looks like this.

00:06:23.679 --> 00:06:27.752
So it's very small,
it's really a desktop version.

00:06:27.776 --> 00:06:29.666
It's a really affordable system.

00:06:29.690 --> 00:06:33.953
And we are really proud of it,
actually, and --

00:06:33.977 --> 00:06:35.977
(Laughter)

00:06:37.006 --> 00:06:42.724
And you have this tiny little system;
there are bigger ones.

00:06:42.748 --> 00:06:45.365
What can you do
with a cheap, affordable system?

00:06:45.389 --> 00:06:50.115
For example, you all know
these hearing aids?

00:06:50.139 --> 00:06:54.492
They have to be produced
individually for each person,

00:06:54.516 --> 00:06:56.217
so this is a perfect example

00:06:56.241 --> 00:07:00.797
for using this technology
to create the shell for a hearing aid.

00:07:01.847 --> 00:07:04.676
Normally, you go to the store,
they scan your ear,

00:07:04.700 --> 00:07:09.036
they send the data
to Germany via email, and --

00:07:09.060 --> 00:07:10.753
(Laughter)

00:07:10.777 --> 00:07:13.054
and then they print it out with a --

00:07:13.078 --> 00:07:14.084
(Applause)

00:07:14.108 --> 00:07:15.449
Thank you.

00:07:15.473 --> 00:07:18.589
(Applause)

00:07:20.894 --> 00:07:23.155
Then they print it out with a big machine,

00:07:23.179 --> 00:07:26.721
and then, when it's ready
to send back to Vienna

00:07:26.745 --> 00:07:28.244
or wherever you are --

00:07:29.284 --> 00:07:30.452
via post --

00:07:31.249 --> 00:07:33.038
then they put in the electronics.

00:07:33.062 --> 00:07:35.439
When you have a microprinter
in your store,

00:07:35.463 --> 00:07:37.527
you can go to the store,

00:07:37.551 --> 00:07:39.116
they scan your ear,

00:07:39.140 --> 00:07:42.004
they just press "Print,"

00:07:42.028 --> 00:07:45.474
the 3-D model gets sliced,

00:07:45.498 --> 00:07:47.141
and you can go for a coffee,

00:07:47.165 --> 00:07:50.465
you can go to the university,
whatever you want,

00:07:50.489 --> 00:07:56.036
and instead of five days, you can have
your ear shell or your hearing aid

00:07:56.060 --> 00:07:58.596
in just one day.

00:07:59.065 --> 00:08:03.353
And that is an example
of how these tiny little machines

00:08:03.377 --> 00:08:07.897
or other cheap 3-D printers
could change our everyday lives.

00:08:08.539 --> 00:08:09.784
So thank you very much,

00:08:09.808 --> 00:08:13.855
and start printing whatever
you want, whatever you need.

00:08:13.879 --> 00:08:15.909
(Applause)
