00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Frank Gehry: I listened to this scientist this morning.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Dr. Mullis was talking about his experiments,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
and I realized that I almost became a scientist.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:16.000
When I was 14 my parents bought me a chemistry set

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
and I decided to make water.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:28.000
(Laughter)

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.000
So, I made a hydrogen generator and I made an oxygen generator,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
and I had the two pipes leading into a beaker

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
and I threw a match in.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
(Laughter)

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
And the glass -- luckily I turned around --

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
I had it all in my back

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
and I was about 15 feet away.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
The wall was covered with ...

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
I had an explosion.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.000
Richard Saul Wurman: Really?

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.000
FG: People on the street came and knocked on the door

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
to see if I was okay.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:02.000
RSW: ... huh. (Laughter)

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
I'd like to start

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
this session again.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.000
The gentleman to my left is the very famous, perhaps overly famous,

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
Frank Gehry.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:15.000
(Laughter)

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.000
(Applause)

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
And Frank, you've come to a place in your life, which is astonishing.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.000
I mean it is astonishing for an artist, for an architect,

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
to become actually an icon and a legend in their own time.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
I mean you have become, whether you can giggle at it

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
because it's a funny ... you know, it's a strange thought,

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
but your building is an icon --

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
you can draw a little picture of that building, it can be used in ads --

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.000
and you've had not rock star status, but celebrity status

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:48.000
in doing what you wanted to do for most of your life.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000
And I know the road was extremely difficult.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.000
And it didn't seem, at least, that your sell outs,

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.000
whatever they were, were very big.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:07.000
You kept moving ahead in a life where you're dependent

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
on working for somebody.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
But that's an interesting thing for a creative person.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
A lot of us work for people;

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
we're in the hands of other people.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.000
And that's one of the great dilemmas -- we're in a creativity session --

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
it's one of the great dilemmas in creativity:

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.000
how to do work that's big enough and not sell out.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
And you've achieved that

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.000
and that makes your win doubly big, triply big.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.000
It's not quite a question but you can comment on it.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
It's a big issue.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000
FG: Well, I've always just ...

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:45.000
I've never really gone out looking for work.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000
I always waited for it to sort of hit me on the head.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
And when I started out,

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
I thought that architecture was a service business

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
and that you had to please the clients and stuff.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.000
And I realized when I'd come into the meetings

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:06.000
with these corrugated metal and chain link stuff,

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
and people would just look at me

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
like I'd just landed from Mars.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000
But I couldn't do anything else.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000
That was my response to the people in the time.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.000
And actually, it was responding to clients that I had

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000
who didn't have very much money, so they couldn't afford very much.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
I think it was circumstantial.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:31.000
Until I got to my house, where the client was my wife.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.000
We bought this tiny little bungalow in Santa Monica

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.000
and for like 50 grand I built a house around it.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.000
And a few people got excited about it.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.000
I was visiting with an artist, Michael Heizer,

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000
out in the desert near Las Vegas somewhere.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.000
He's building this huge concrete place.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.000
And it was late in the evening. We'd had a lot to drink.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.000
We were standing out in the desert all alone and,

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000
thinking about my house, he said,

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:03.000
"Did it ever occur to you if you built stuff more permanent,

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.000
somewhere in 2000 years somebody's going to like it?"

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.000
(Laughter)

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:17.000
So, I thought, "Yeah, that's probably a good idea."

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:21.000
Luckily I started to get some clients that had a little more money,

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000
so the stuff was a little more permanent.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000
But I just found out the world ain't going to last that long,

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000
this guy was telling us the other day.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.000
So where do we go now?

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000
Back to -- everything's so temporary.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:39.000
I don't see it the way you characterized it.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.000
For me, every day is a new thing.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:49.000
I approach each project with a new insecurity,

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000
almost like the first project I ever did,

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:55.000
and I get the sweats,

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000
I go in and start working, I'm not sure where I'm going --

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000
if I knew where I was going, I wouldn't do it.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000
When I can predict or plan it, I don't do it.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000
I discard it.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.000
So I approach it with the same trepidation.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:13.000
Obviously, over time I have a lot more confidence

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000
that it's going to be OK.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.000
I do run a kind of a business --

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000
I've got 120 people

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000
and you've got to pay them,

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000
so there's a lot of responsibility involved --

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:29.000
but the actual work on the project is with,

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000
I think, a healthy insecurity.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:38.000
And like the playwright said the other day -- I could relate to him:

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000
you're not sure.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.000
When Bilbao was finished and I looked at it,

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000
I saw all the mistakes, I saw ...

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.000
They weren't mistakes;

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000
I saw everything that I would have changed

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.000
and I was embarrassed by it.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.000
I felt an embarrassment -- "How could I have done that?

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:00.000
How could I have made shapes like that or done stuff like that?"

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:06.000
It's taken several years to now look at it detached and say --

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:11.000
as you walk around the corner and a piece of it works with the road

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:15.000
and the street, and it appears to have a relationship --

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000
that I started to like it.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.000
RSW: What's the status of the New York project?

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000
FG: I don't really know.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:26.000
Tom Krens came to me with Bilbao and explained it all to me,

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000
and I thought he was nuts.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000
I didn't think he knew what he was doing,

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000
and he pulled it off.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:36.000
So, I think he's Icarus and Phoenix all in one guy.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.000
(Laughter)

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:42.000
He gets up there and then he ... comes back up.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000
They're still talking about it.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:53.000
September 11 generated some interest

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:57.000
in moving it over to Ground Zero,

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.000
and I'm totally against that.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:10.000
I just feel uncomfortable talking about or building anything on Ground Zero

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.000
I think for a long time.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.000
RSW: The picture on the screen,

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.000
is that Disney?

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:19.000
FG: Yeah.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.000
RSW: How much further along is it than that,

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:22.000
and when will that be finished?

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:28.000
FG: That will be finished in 2003 -- September, October --

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:36.000
and I'm hoping Kyu, and Herbie, and Yo-Yo and all those guys

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.000
come play with us at that place.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.000
Luckily, today most of the people I'm working with are people I really like.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:47.000
Richard Koshalek is probably one of the main reasons

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:50.000
that Disney Hall came to me.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:53.000
He's been a cheerleader for quite a long time.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:57.000
There aren't many people around that are really involved

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.000
with architecture as clients.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:03.000
If you think about the world,

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.000
and even just in this audience,

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:11.000
most of us are involved with buildings.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:14.000
Nothing that you would call architecture, right?

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:18.000
And so to find one, a guy like that,

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.000
you hang on to him.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:24.000
He's become the head of Art Center,

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:28.000
and there's a building by Craig Ellwood there.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:32.000
I knew Craig and respected him.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.000
They want to add to it

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:35.000
and it's hard to add to a building like that --

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:39.000
it's a beautiful, minimalist, black steel building --

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:48.000
and Richard wants to add a library and more student stuff

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000
and it's a lot of acreage.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:55.000
I convinced him to let me bring in another architect

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:58.000
from Portugal: Alvaro Siza.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.000
RSW: Why did you want that?

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000
FG: I knew you'd ask that question.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.000
It was intuitive.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:09.000
(Laughter)

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:15.000
Alvaro Siza grew up and lived in Portugal

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:20.000
and is probably considered the Portuguese main guy in architecture.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:23.000
I visited with him a few years ago

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.000
and he showed me his early work,

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:30.000
and his early work had a resemblance to my early work.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:35.000
When I came out of college,

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:39.000
I started to try to do things contextually in Southern California,

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:45.000
and you got into the logic of Spanish colonial tile roofs

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.000
and things like that.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:52.000
I tried to understand that language as a beginning,

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.000
as a place to jump off,

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:59.000
and there was so much of it being done by spec builders

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:03.000
and it was trivialized so much that it wasn't ...

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.000
I just stopped.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.000
I mean, Charlie Moore did a bunch of it,

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:11.000
but it didn't feel good to me.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:14.000
Siza, on the other hand, continued in Portugal

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:17.000
where the real stuff was

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:25.000
and evolved a modern language that relates to that historic language.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:31.000
And I always felt that he should come to Southern California

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:32.000
and do a building.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:36.000
I tried to get him a couple of jobs and they didn't pan out.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:44.000
I like the idea of collaboration with people like that

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:48.000
because it pushes you.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:56.000
I've done it with Claes Oldenburg and with Richard Serra,

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:00.000
who doesn't think architecture is art.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.000
Did you see that thing?

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:05.000
RSW: No. What did he say?

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:07.000
FG: He calls architecture "plumbing."

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:10.000
(Laughter)

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:13.000
FG: Anyway, the Siza thing.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.000
It's a richer experience.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:19.000
It must be like that for Kyu doing things with musicians --

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.000
it's similar to that I would imagine --

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.000
where you ... huh?

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.000
Audience: Liquid architecture.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.000
FG: Liquid architecture.

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:28.000
(Laughter)

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:32.000
Where you ... It's like jazz: you improvise, you work together,

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:38.000
you play off each other, you make something,

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.000
they make something.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:43.000
And I think

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:47.000
for me, it's a way of trying to understand the city

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.000
and what might happen in the city.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:52.000
RSW: Is it going to be near the current campus?

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.000
Or is it going to be down near ...

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.000
FG: No, it's near the current campus.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.000
Anyway, he's that kind of patron.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.000
It's not his money, of course.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:03.000
(Laughter)

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:05.000
RSW: What's his schedule on that?

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:06.000
FG: I don't know.

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.000
What's the schedule, Richard?

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.000
Richard Koshalek: [Unclear] starts from 2004.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.000
FG: 2004.

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:15.000
You can come to the opening. I'll invite you.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:23.000
No, but the issue of city building in democracy is interesting

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:26.000
because it creates chaos, right?

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:30.000
Everybody doing their thing makes a very chaotic environment,

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:35.000
and if you can figure out how to work off each other --

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:40.000
if you can get a bunch of people

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:44.000
who respect each other's work and play off each other,

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:46.000
you might be able to create models for

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:54.000
how to build sections of the city without resorting to the one architect.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.000
Like the Rockefeller Center model,

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:59.000
which is kind of from another era.

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:02.000
RSW: I found the most remarkable thing.

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:07.000
My preconception of Bilbao was this wonderful building,

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:09.000
you go inside and there'd be extraordinary spaces.

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:12.000
I'd seen drawings you had presented here at TED.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:17.000
The surprise of Bilbao was in its context to the city.

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:19.000
That was the surprise of going across the river,

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:21.000
of going on the highway around it,

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:24.000
of walking down the street and finding it.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:27.000
That was the real surprise of Bilbao.

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:28.000
FG: But you know, Richard,

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.000
most architects when they present their work --

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:31.000
most of the people we know,

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:34.000
you get up and you talk about your work,

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:41.000
and it's almost like you tell everybody you're a good guy

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:46.000
by saying, "Look, I'm worried about the context,

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.000
I'm worried about the city,

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:51.000
I'm worried about my client,

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:53.000
I worry about budget, that I'm on time."

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.000
Blah, blah, blah and all that stuff.

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:59.000
And it's like cleansing yourself so that you can ...

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:06.000
by saying all that, it means your work is good somehow.

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:09.000
And I think everybody --

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:12.000
I mean that should be a matter of fact, like gravity.

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:15.000
You're not going to defy gravity.

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:17.000
You've got to work with the building department.

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:21.000
If you don't meet the budgets, you're not going to get much work.

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:25.000
If it leaks --

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:27.000
Bilbao did not leak.

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:31.000
I was so proud.

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:33.000
(Laughter)

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:36.000
The MIT project -- they were interviewing me for MIT

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:39.000
and they sent their facilities people to Bilbao.

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:41.000
I met them in Bilbao.

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:43.000
They came for three days.

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:45.000
RSW: This is the computer building?

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:46.000
FG: Yeah, the computer building.

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.000
They were there three days and it rained every day

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:50.000
and they kept walking around --

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:52.000
I noticed they were looking under things

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:54.000
and looking for things,

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:58.000
and they wanted to know where the buckets were hidden, you know?

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:00.000
People put buckets out ...

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.000
I was clean. There wasn't a bloody leak in the place,

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:05.000
it was just fantastic.

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:07.000
But you've got to --

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:11.000
yeah, well up until then every building leaked, so this ...

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:16.000
(Laughter)

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:18.000
RSW: Frank had a sort of ...

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:19.000
FG: Ask Miriam!

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:24.000
RW: ... sort of had a fame. His fame was built on that in L.A. for a while.

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:27.000
(Laughter)

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:30.000
FG: You've all heard the Frank Lloyd Wright story,

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:32.000
when the woman called and said,

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:37.000
"Mr. Wright, I'm sitting on the couch

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:39.000
and the water's pouring in on my head."

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:41.000
And he said, "Madam, move your chair."

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:45.000
(Laughter)

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:49.000
So, some years later I was doing a building,

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:51.000
a little house on the beach for Norton Simon,

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:55.000
and his secretary, who was kind of a hell on wheels type lady,

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:57.000
called me and said,

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:01.000
"Mr. Simon's sitting at his desk

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:03.000
and the water's coming in on his head."

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:05.000
And I told her the Frank Lloyd Wright story.

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:07.000
RSW: Didn't get a laugh.

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:09.000
FG: No. Not now either.

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:14.000
(Laughter)

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:20.000
But my point is that ... and I call it the "then what?"

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:22.000
OK, you solved all the problems,

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:25.000
you did all the stuff, you made nice,

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:27.000
you loved your clients,

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:29.000
you loved the city,

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:31.000
you're a good guy, you're a good person ...

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:33.000
and then what?

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:35.000
What do you bring to it?

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:39.000
And I think that's what I've always been interested in,

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:46.000
is that -- which is a personal kind of expression.

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:55.000
Bilbao, I think, shows that you can have

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:57.000
that kind of personal expression

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:01.000
and still touch all the bases that are necessary

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:03.000
of fitting into the city.

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:05.000
That's what reminded me of it.

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:10.000
And I think that's the issue, you know;

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:14.000
it's the "then what" that most clients who hire architects --

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:19.000
most clients aren't hiring architects for that.

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:23.000
They're hiring them to get it done, get it on budget,

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:26.000
be polite,

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:37.000
and they're missing out on the real value of an architect.

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:40.000
RSW: At a certain point a number of years ago, people --

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:47.000
when Michael Graves was a fashion, before teapots ...

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:50.000
FG: I did a teapot and nobody bought it.

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:52.000
(Laughter)

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:54.000
RSW: Did it leak?

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:55.000
FG: No.

00:17:55.000 --> 00:18:01.000
(Laughter)

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:07.000
RSW: ... people wanted a Michael Graves building.

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:12.000
Is that a curse, that people want a Bilbao building?

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:17.000
FG: Yeah.

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:22.000
Since Bilbao opened, which is now four, five years,

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:26.000
both Krens and I have been called

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:31.000
with at least 100 opportunities --

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:38.000
China, Brazil, other parts of Spain --

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:41.000
to come in and do the Bilbao effect.

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:44.000
And I've met with some of these people.

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:46.000
Usually I say no right away,

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:49.000
but some of them come with pedigree

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:52.000
and they sound well-intentioned

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:57.000
and they get you for at least one or two meetings.

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:03.000
In one case, I flew all the way to Malaga with a team

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:09.000
because the thing was signed with seals and various

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:15.000
very official seals from the city,

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:19.000
and that they wanted me to come and do a building in their port.

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:21.000
I asked them what kind of building it was.

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:24.000
"When you get here we'll explain it." Blah, blah, blah.

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:27.000
So four of us went.

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:32.000
And they took us -- they put us up in a great hotel

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:35.000
and we were looking over the bay,

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:38.000
and then they took us in a boat out in the water

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:41.000
and showed us all these sights in the harbor.

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:46.000
Each one was more beautiful than the other.

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:51.000
And then we were going to have lunch with the mayor

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:53.000
and we were going to have dinner with

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:57.000
the most important people in Malaga.

00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:00.000
Just before going to lunch with the mayor,

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:03.000
we went to the harbor commissioner.

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:06.000
It was a table as long as this carpet

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:08.000
and the harbor commissioner was here,

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:10.000
and I was here, and my guys.

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:13.000
We sat down, and we had a drink of water

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:15.000
and everybody was quiet.

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:17.000
And the guy looked at me and said,

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:20.000
"Now what can I do for you, Mr. Gehry?"

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:24.000
(Laughter)

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:26.000
RSW: Oh, my God.

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:28.000
FG: So, I got up.

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:30.000
I said to my team,

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:32.000
"Let's get out of here."

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:33.000
We stood up, we walked out.

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:36.000
They followed -- the guy that dragged us there followed us and he said,

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:38.000
"You mean you're not going to have lunch with the mayor?"

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:40.000
I said, "Nope."

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:42.000
"You're not going to have dinner at all?"

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:46.000
They just brought us there to hustle this group,

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:48.000
you know, to create a project.

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:50.000
And we get a lot of that.

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:56.000
Luckily, I'm old enough that

00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:59.000
I can complain I can't travel.

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:01.000
(Laughter)

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:04.000
I don't have my own plane yet.

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:09.000
RSW: Well, I'm going to wind this up and wind up the meeting

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:11.000
because it's been very long.

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:13.000
But let me just say a couple words.

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:15.000
FG: Can I say something?

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:19.000
Are you going to talk about me or you?

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:22.000
(Laughter)

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:25.000
(Applause)

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:28.000
RSW: Once a shit, always a shit!

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:33.000
FG: Because I want to get a standing ovation like everybody, so ...

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:35.000
RSW: You're going to get one! You're going to get one!

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:36.000
(Laughter)

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:38.000
I'm going to make it for you!

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:39.000
FG: No, no. Wait a minute!

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:41.000
(Applause)
