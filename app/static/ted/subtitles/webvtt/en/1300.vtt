WEBVTT

00:00:01.193 --> 00:00:03.490
Meet Inook. He's a pretty happy guy.

00:00:03.514 --> 00:00:05.097
And I'd be pretty happy, too,

00:00:05.121 --> 00:00:09.116
if this was the first time my community
had just gained access to fresh water.

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:10.884
Inook is from the country of Malawi,

00:00:10.908 --> 00:00:13.636
the small sliver of a country
in Southern Africa,

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:15.803
known as "The Warm Heart of Africa."

00:00:15.827 --> 00:00:19.652
Over the past 10 years, five million
more people like Inook in Malawi

00:00:19.676 --> 00:00:21.335
have gained access to fresh water.

00:00:22.509 --> 00:00:27.120
But what's unfortunate
is that this picture is a lie.

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:30.488
I'll come back to that in a second.

00:00:31.171 --> 00:00:34.960
Ten years ago, two Waterloo engineers
sparked a movement across Canada,

00:00:34.984 --> 00:00:36.421
"Engineers Without Borders."

00:00:36.445 --> 00:00:40.760
This movement was based on the concept
that it was completely unacceptable

00:00:40.784 --> 00:00:44.194
that 5 million people in Malawi
did not have access to fresh water,

00:00:44.218 --> 00:00:47.116
when us engineers back in Canada
were working on problems

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:49.427
such as making a photocopier
increase its speed

00:00:49.451 --> 00:00:52.388
from 149 pages a minute
to 151 pages per minute.

00:00:52.904 --> 00:00:55.348
We needed to work
on problems that mattered.

00:00:55.372 --> 00:00:57.973
I was fortunate, I founded
the Calgary chapter here.

00:00:57.997 --> 00:01:00.419
I got to be the first director
of overseas programs

00:01:00.443 --> 00:01:02.361
for Engineers Without Borders in Africa,

00:01:02.385 --> 00:01:03.866
where I worked for four years.

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:06.079
And I got to work
with hundreds of businesses,

00:01:06.103 --> 00:01:08.153
non-government organizations, governments,

00:01:08.177 --> 00:01:10.361
all working in this field of development.

00:01:10.971 --> 00:01:13.931
It was really fantastic working
for Engineers Without Borders

00:01:13.955 --> 00:01:17.111
because even though we worked
on hundred-million-dollar projects,

00:01:17.135 --> 00:01:18.316
we had this philosophy

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:21.879
that if we were really going to understand
the problems in local Africa,

00:01:21.903 --> 00:01:24.564
we needed to live like local Africans.

00:01:24.588 --> 00:01:27.221
So, as a lot of ex-patriots
would spend most of the time

00:01:27.245 --> 00:01:29.090
in the capital cities and boardrooms,

00:01:29.114 --> 00:01:32.969
we'd spend our time in villages
learning local languages,

00:01:32.993 --> 00:01:35.031
traveling on public transports.

00:01:35.055 --> 00:01:39.535
And what this allowed us to do
was to get a really deep understanding

00:01:39.559 --> 00:01:41.527
of what was going on at the field level.

00:01:41.551 --> 00:01:42.969
Combined with this experience

00:01:42.993 --> 00:01:45.823
and hundreds of other Engineers
Without Borders experiences,

00:01:45.847 --> 00:01:49.644
we got a really interesting perspective
of what's going on in this aid industry.

00:01:49.668 --> 00:01:52.196
The aid industry has gotten
a lot of attention lately.

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:55.320
A lot of economists have become authors
and have written about it.

00:01:55.344 --> 00:01:57.839
There's a lot of controversy
about its effectiveness,

00:01:57.863 --> 00:02:00.944
some even asking
the question, "Has aid failed?"

00:02:00.968 --> 00:02:02.801
It's a very interesting question.

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:05.561
Now, I can confidently say

00:02:05.585 --> 00:02:08.034
on behalf of Engineers
Without Borders staff members

00:02:08.058 --> 00:02:11.708
that, failed or not, we definitely feel
that the aid system is broken.

00:02:12.675 --> 00:02:13.828
And when I say broken,

00:02:13.852 --> 00:02:16.549
I'm not talking about
what the media usually talks about.

00:02:16.573 --> 00:02:19.634
It's not about corrupt dictators
or about corruption.

00:02:19.658 --> 00:02:22.484
Those issues still happen in Africa,

00:02:22.508 --> 00:02:25.875
but they're much more the minority
than they are the mainstream today.

00:02:25.899 --> 00:02:27.627
I'm talking about aid being broken

00:02:27.651 --> 00:02:31.533
in democratically elected,
stable governments with no civil unrest,

00:02:31.557 --> 00:02:34.093
countries like Ghana, Malawi and Zambia.

00:02:35.484 --> 00:02:37.335
So, I talked about Malawi.

00:02:37.758 --> 00:02:42.088
The World Bank has stated
that 80% of the people in Malawi

00:02:42.112 --> 00:02:43.971
have access to fresh water sources.

00:02:43.995 --> 00:02:46.927
So one of our staff members
in Malawi, this is Owen,

00:02:46.951 --> 00:02:48.906
was visiting one of those water points.

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:50.459
It was a gravity-fed system

00:02:50.483 --> 00:02:52.805
that was commissioned
by the Canadian government

00:02:52.829 --> 00:02:54.836
and finished about a year and a half ago.

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:57.248
A gravity-fed system
basically is a bunch of pipes

00:02:57.272 --> 00:02:59.666
that pipe water down
from an elevated region

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:02.287
down into a number of communities
where there are taps,

00:03:02.311 --> 00:03:03.890
and people can access that water.

00:03:03.914 --> 00:03:06.474
And he was going around
turning on some of those taps,

00:03:06.498 --> 00:03:07.713
and some weren't working.

00:03:07.737 --> 00:03:09.098
So he asked the community,

00:03:09.122 --> 00:03:11.042
"How many of these aren't working?"

00:03:11.066 --> 00:03:13.381
And they said, "Well, out of 113, 81."

00:03:14.245 --> 00:03:17.320
81? What's the problem? What's going on?

00:03:17.344 --> 00:03:21.537
He found out that a lot of the pipes
had sprung leaks and broken down.

00:03:22.245 --> 00:03:25.140
All right, not a big deal,
pipes break down everywhere.

00:03:25.164 --> 00:03:27.652
But the problem
with this project was that,

00:03:27.676 --> 00:03:29.686
even though the infrastructure was built,

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:34.078
there was no thinking about
who was going to maintain the system.

00:03:34.102 --> 00:03:37.602
Some people really took initiative
and tried to fix the pipes themselves,

00:03:37.626 --> 00:03:40.682
but there was a lack
of affordable spare parts available.

00:03:40.706 --> 00:03:42.643
This situation is typical.

00:03:43.685 --> 00:03:49.494
This is a graphic showing one area
of Malawi, I think it's an urban area,

00:03:49.518 --> 00:03:52.479
where the green dots
are functional water points,

00:03:52.503 --> 00:03:55.190
yellow, are ones that are working
but breaking down,

00:03:55.214 --> 00:03:56.934
and red are not functional.

00:03:56.958 --> 00:03:58.122
Hardly eighty percent.

00:03:58.146 --> 00:04:00.789
Actually, Engineers Without Borders
has done some work

00:04:00.813 --> 00:04:04.423
and found out that even though there's 80%
coverage of water points,

00:04:04.447 --> 00:04:06.083
40% are not working.

00:04:07.519 --> 00:04:09.360
See, this issue is ...

00:04:09.384 --> 00:04:11.834
A lot of donors and projects
end up focusing on

00:04:11.858 --> 00:04:13.438
the hardware side of the issue

00:04:13.462 --> 00:04:17.503
and not really realizing the importance
of the software side of things.

00:04:18.416 --> 00:04:21.744
At first it's like, software --
of course you have to do maintenance.

00:04:21.768 --> 00:04:24.663
But when you think about it
as people donating to charities,

00:04:24.687 --> 00:04:26.148
it makes you feel a lot better

00:04:26.172 --> 00:04:28.856
if you know that your money went
to something tangible,

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:31.170
something like a well,
something like a school,

00:04:31.194 --> 00:04:33.037
something like giving a family a goat.

00:04:33.061 --> 00:04:35.524
It's not as sexy and easy
to tell your friends about

00:04:35.548 --> 00:04:38.995
how you helped fund a water committee
or paid for teacher salaries.

00:04:39.019 --> 00:04:42.420
So when I say that
this picture of Inook is a lie,

00:04:43.775 --> 00:04:45.899
it's not a lie when the picture is taken.

00:04:46.701 --> 00:04:50.348
It only becomes a lie
a year or two afterwards.

00:04:52.047 --> 00:04:55.114
When looking at these pictures,
one of my great colleagues said,

00:04:55.138 --> 00:04:57.653
"Everything people see
from Africa doesn't matter.

00:04:57.677 --> 00:05:01.209
And everything that matters
from Africa, people don't get to see."

00:05:01.233 --> 00:05:04.752
And this problem goes a lot further
that just broken down water points.

00:05:04.776 --> 00:05:09.475
Owen, after seeing this water point,
discovered not more than 30 feet away:

00:05:09.499 --> 00:05:12.955
"Hey there's another set of taps
that look really broken down, too,

00:05:12.979 --> 00:05:14.937
but they're not attached to the system."

00:05:14.961 --> 00:05:17.189
And he asked the community, "What's that?"

00:05:17.213 --> 00:05:21.171
They said: "Oh, that's the American
government gravity-fed water system."

00:05:22.537 --> 00:05:24.212
It was built over ten years ago.

00:05:25.323 --> 00:05:27.073
He said, "What happened to that?"

00:05:27.097 --> 00:05:30.726
They said, "Oh, it also broke down
about a year and a half later."

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:34.906
How is it that a project
that failed ten years ago

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:38.189
was rebuilt with almost
the same technology, same process,

00:05:38.213 --> 00:05:41.308
and had exactly the same failure
ten years later?

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:46.626
I've recently joined a start-up company
that sells goods online,

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:48.832
a lot of them from Africa,
fair-trade goods --

00:05:48.856 --> 00:05:50.985
it's sort of like the ethical
eBay or Amazon.

00:05:51.009 --> 00:05:53.747
And what we've learned
being a private sector start-up is,

00:05:53.771 --> 00:05:55.308
if we don't serve our customers

00:05:55.332 --> 00:05:57.648
and we don't provide them
the product they need,

00:05:57.672 --> 00:05:58.831
they won't buy it.

00:05:58.855 --> 00:06:01.953
And then if we don't innovate, change
and adapt to their needs,

00:06:01.977 --> 00:06:03.148
we go out of business.

00:06:03.172 --> 00:06:05.140
They have a power to hold us accountable.

00:06:05.164 --> 00:06:06.701
If we look to the public sector,

00:06:06.725 --> 00:06:09.768
it doesn't adapt and change
quite as fast as the private sector,

00:06:09.792 --> 00:06:11.054
but at the end of the day,

00:06:11.078 --> 00:06:14.356
if the elected government doesn't meet
the needs of its constituents,

00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:16.497
they have a chance
to vote them out of power,

00:06:16.521 --> 00:06:18.192
therefore holding them accountable.

00:06:18.216 --> 00:06:19.665
But in the development sector,

00:06:19.689 --> 00:06:22.287
if they don't serve the needs
of their beneficiaries --

00:06:22.311 --> 00:06:25.549
and they're not just NGOs, but governments
and businesses as well --

00:06:25.573 --> 00:06:28.686
the beneficiaries have no power
to vote them out or to fire them.

00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:31.271
The people who have that power
are the donors.

00:06:31.295 --> 00:06:34.548
And when you look at the system,
you can see some of the challenges.

00:06:34.572 --> 00:06:37.734
Development is the sector
that focuses more on pleasing the donors

00:06:37.758 --> 00:06:40.045
and making them happy
and communicating to them,

00:06:40.069 --> 00:06:42.890
as opposed to understanding
the needs of the beneficiaries.

00:06:42.914 --> 00:06:46.315
Because of that, systematic challenge
is very slow to innovate,

00:06:46.339 --> 00:06:47.829
there's very little change,

00:06:47.853 --> 00:06:50.675
and you get exactly the same project
built ten years later

00:06:50.699 --> 00:06:52.420
that fails in exactly the same way.

00:06:52.444 --> 00:06:53.836
So what we do about this?

00:06:54.285 --> 00:06:55.885
First answer is easy:

00:06:55.909 --> 00:06:57.923
we invest in the private
and public sectors

00:06:57.947 --> 00:06:59.126
in the developing world.

00:06:59.150 --> 00:07:02.005
They're inherently structurally built
to be more sustainable

00:07:02.029 --> 00:07:04.482
and to allow beneficiaries
to hold them accountable.

00:07:04.506 --> 00:07:07.550
However, 70% of people
in sub-Saharan Africa

00:07:07.574 --> 00:07:10.617
still make less than two dollars
a day and are still in poverty.

00:07:10.641 --> 00:07:13.918
And a lot of that reason is because
the private and the public sector

00:07:13.942 --> 00:07:15.615
are not serving them appropriately.

00:07:15.639 --> 00:07:18.710
So we do need to invest in businesses
and governments in Africa,

00:07:18.734 --> 00:07:22.052
but it's still going to take a long time
for the problems to be fixed.

00:07:22.076 --> 00:07:24.068
Therefore, that leaves us with one option

00:07:24.092 --> 00:07:25.871
and we need to work with this system.

00:07:25.895 --> 00:07:27.286
Therefore, we have to fix it.

00:07:27.310 --> 00:07:30.767
We need to make it more accountable,
more creative and more transparent.

00:07:30.791 --> 00:07:33.818
We need to start innovating,
coming up with really neat ideas --

00:07:33.842 --> 00:07:37.146
ideas like giving beneficiaries
a chance to rate their projects

00:07:37.170 --> 00:07:38.649
using their mobile phones --

00:07:38.673 --> 00:07:41.367
that donors and NGOs can understand.

00:07:41.391 --> 00:07:44.972
Or moving our donors
closer to our beneficiaries.

00:07:44.996 --> 00:07:46.347
Currently, only 20%

00:07:46.371 --> 00:07:49.479
of the Canadian International
Development Agency's African staff

00:07:49.503 --> 00:07:50.873
are based in Africa.

00:07:50.897 --> 00:07:55.378
Ideas like funding development sectors
like VCs fund businesses:

00:07:55.402 --> 00:07:58.572
What would it be like if a donor
funded ten projects

00:07:58.596 --> 00:08:01.134
and expected four of them to do OK,

00:08:01.158 --> 00:08:02.531
one of them to do fantastic

00:08:02.555 --> 00:08:04.279
and five of them to fail?

00:08:04.303 --> 00:08:08.419
And not all of the solutions
need to be that complex.

00:08:09.162 --> 00:08:12.626
Engineers Without Borders is working on
one that's actually quite simple;

00:08:12.650 --> 00:08:14.311
it's admitting failure.

00:08:14.335 --> 00:08:17.245
My first project with Engineers
Without Borders was in India.

00:08:17.269 --> 00:08:18.863
I worked with a bunch of schools,

00:08:18.887 --> 00:08:21.351
the poorest schools in India,
the untouchable caste.

00:08:21.375 --> 00:08:24.302
This is Bani, she was a girl
who was in one of those schools

00:08:24.326 --> 00:08:27.391
and she and her classmates had to spend
two to three hours a day

00:08:27.415 --> 00:08:30.040
walking to collect water
to bring it back to the school

00:08:30.064 --> 00:08:32.660
so they could have fresh water
to drink and for cooking

00:08:32.684 --> 00:08:34.196
and for going to the bathroom.

00:08:34.220 --> 00:08:37.341
My job in Engineers Without Borders
was to help solve the problem.

00:08:37.365 --> 00:08:38.799
I worked with the communities;

00:08:38.823 --> 00:08:40.995
we came up with rainwater
harvesting solutions

00:08:41.019 --> 00:08:43.611
to collect water from the rooftops
during the monsoons,

00:08:43.635 --> 00:08:46.709
bring it through gutters, filter
and store it for the dry season.

00:08:46.733 --> 00:08:49.658
I worked there for a number
of months, and by the time I left,

00:08:49.682 --> 00:08:51.983
we had the project funded
and being implemented.

00:08:52.007 --> 00:08:54.123
I returned back home
to Canada almost a hero.

00:08:54.147 --> 00:08:56.845
My friends and family
were like, "Wow, that's fantastic!

00:08:56.869 --> 00:09:00.318
You gave up your job in the oil
and gas sector to go volunteer in India.

00:09:00.342 --> 00:09:01.836
That's really inspiring."

00:09:03.114 --> 00:09:06.800
A year later, I contacted my NGO
to see how everything was going

00:09:06.824 --> 00:09:08.859
with the rainwater harvesting systems.

00:09:09.962 --> 00:09:13.614
And they told me that not a single one
was still operating.

00:09:15.654 --> 00:09:18.949
The reason was because a lot
of them had been built,

00:09:18.973 --> 00:09:21.334
but some of them had broken down

00:09:21.358 --> 00:09:24.173
because there was no maintenance
schedule put in place.

00:09:25.065 --> 00:09:28.088
I had made the exact same mistake
that I criticized earlier.

00:09:30.941 --> 00:09:33.303
When I thought of my friends
and family back home

00:09:33.327 --> 00:09:34.769
who thought I was such a hero,

00:09:34.793 --> 00:09:36.146
I felt like an impostor.

00:09:37.897 --> 00:09:40.566
I thought of Bani,
I didn't help her at all.

00:09:41.978 --> 00:09:44.058
Admitting failure is actually quite hard,

00:09:44.082 --> 00:09:46.305
and I didn't tell many people about this.

00:09:46.329 --> 00:09:50.829
And one of the only things
that helped me feel better about this --

00:09:50.853 --> 00:09:52.941
and it's a bit of a shame to say this —

00:09:52.965 --> 00:09:54.259
was that I started to learn

00:09:54.283 --> 00:09:57.586
that other people in Engineers
Without Borders had failed, too.

00:09:57.610 --> 00:10:01.122
But Engineers Without Borders has
this culture of embracing failure openly

00:10:01.146 --> 00:10:02.560
and letting us talk about it.

00:10:02.584 --> 00:10:05.378
And it was only through a bunch
of us talking about failure

00:10:05.402 --> 00:10:08.098
that we really got to see
we're making a lot of mistakes,

00:10:08.122 --> 00:10:10.912
and we're making the same mistakes
and can learn from them.

00:10:10.936 --> 00:10:12.769
And we started to innovate and change.

00:10:12.793 --> 00:10:15.393
Engineers Without Borders
is drastically different now,

00:10:15.417 --> 00:10:19.077
10 years later than what we thought
Engineers should be doing in development.

00:10:19.101 --> 00:10:22.418
We don't build water points anymore;
in fact, we don't build anything

00:10:22.442 --> 00:10:23.593
other than spreadsheets.

00:10:23.617 --> 00:10:25.831
We now have this innovative
marketing campaign,

00:10:25.855 --> 00:10:27.448
"Sponsor an African spreadsheet,"

00:10:27.472 --> 00:10:30.871
because we understand that
the problems are not hardware problems;

00:10:30.895 --> 00:10:32.989
it's all about
that software side of things.

00:10:33.013 --> 00:10:35.302
But it's a hard concept
to get across to people;

00:10:35.326 --> 00:10:37.055
they want to fund wells and schools.

00:10:37.079 --> 00:10:39.453
But it's really about
the software side of things,

00:10:39.477 --> 00:10:42.174
and it's a lot longer a process
to fund those things.

00:10:42.198 --> 00:10:44.041
And it's not sexy, but it works.

00:10:44.065 --> 00:10:48.415
Our staff members were really exited
to share this failure internally,

00:10:48.439 --> 00:10:51.745
but we still were not doing a good job
of letting other people know.

00:10:51.769 --> 00:10:55.216
And some very courageous field staff
were getting upset at the management

00:10:55.240 --> 00:10:58.073
because other projects were
going to make the same failures;

00:10:58.097 --> 00:10:59.253
they weren't learning.

00:10:59.277 --> 00:11:01.034
So they pushed our management staff.

00:11:01.058 --> 00:11:03.243
And we were nervous
publishing our failures,

00:11:03.267 --> 00:11:04.681
but for the last three years,

00:11:04.705 --> 00:11:07.756
Engineers Without Borders has published
an annual failure report

00:11:07.780 --> 00:11:09.888
citing our biggest failures.

00:11:09.912 --> 00:11:12.341
At first, I was asked,
"What do your donors think?"

00:11:12.365 --> 00:11:16.440
and I think, "How would my donors feel

00:11:16.464 --> 00:11:21.276
if they knew the money they had spent
and saved up and generously donated

00:11:21.300 --> 00:11:22.655
had had no impact?"

00:11:23.327 --> 00:11:24.963
And you know, that's tough.

00:11:25.957 --> 00:11:28.105
And our donors felt that, too.

00:11:28.129 --> 00:11:30.541
But once they started
reading the failures,

00:11:30.565 --> 00:11:32.964
they understood the power
of those lessons learned

00:11:32.988 --> 00:11:35.585
and realized it's an injustice
not to be sharing these.

00:11:35.609 --> 00:11:37.925
Then we realized that not
everyone reads reports,

00:11:37.949 --> 00:11:40.075
so we built a website,
admittingfailure.com.

00:11:40.099 --> 00:11:43.592
This is for all organizations to come
and start admitting their failures,

00:11:43.616 --> 00:11:46.540
and to start having
a discussion about failure.

00:11:46.564 --> 00:11:48.011
The concept is catching on.

00:11:48.035 --> 00:11:51.562
The Harvard Business Review, just last
month, published their first review

00:11:51.586 --> 00:11:52.854
focused on failure.

00:11:52.878 --> 00:11:55.445
Two big companies lately
have also dealt with failure.

00:11:55.469 --> 00:11:58.118
I talk to my friends
in other sectors and they're like,

00:11:58.142 --> 00:12:01.091
"It's not just the development sector
that has this challenge,

00:12:01.115 --> 00:12:03.082
it crosses into a lot of other sectors."

00:12:03.106 --> 00:12:04.937
Two companies had big failures lately.

00:12:04.961 --> 00:12:08.531
What's interesting about them is,
one of them publicly admitted the failure

00:12:08.555 --> 00:12:12.057
and talked about what they learned
from it and what they'll do next time.

00:12:12.081 --> 00:12:15.187
The other one kind of tried
to not talk about it at all.

00:12:15.211 --> 00:12:19.994
It will be interesting looking forward
to see which of those strategies works.

00:12:20.018 --> 00:12:23.016
I'd like to ask people to, first of all,

00:12:23.040 --> 00:12:29.015
think about: How does your organization
think about and share failure?

00:12:29.525 --> 00:12:31.135
Maybe ask the person next to you,

00:12:31.159 --> 00:12:34.487
because I think it can generate
some really interesting conversations.

00:12:34.511 --> 00:12:39.338
And lastly, I'd like to turn back
to this question, "Has aid failed?"

00:12:39.362 --> 00:12:42.048
I think I'll say that, for me,
the answer is "Yes,"

00:12:42.913 --> 00:12:45.161
but only because it hasn't failed enough.

00:12:46.106 --> 00:12:47.257
Thank you.

00:12:47.281 --> 00:12:48.797
(Applause)
