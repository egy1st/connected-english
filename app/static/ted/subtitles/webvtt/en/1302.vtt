00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
I want to talk to you

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
about one of the biggest myths in medicine,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
and that is the idea

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
that all we need are more medical breakthroughs

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
and then all of our problems will be solved.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Our society loves to romanticize

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
the idea of the single, solo inventor

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
who, working late in the lab one night,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
makes an earthshaking discovery,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
and voila, overnight everything's changed.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
That's a very appealing picture,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
however, it's just not true.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
In fact, medicine today is a team sport.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
And in many ways,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
it always has been.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
I'd like to share with you a story

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
about how I've experienced this very dramatically

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
in my own work.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
I'm a surgeon,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
and we surgeons have always had

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
this special relationship with light.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000
When I make an incision inside a patient's body, it's dark.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
We need to shine light to see what we're doing.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
And this is why, traditionally,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
surgeries have always started so early in the morning --

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
to take advantage of daylight hours.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
And if you look at historical pictures

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
of the early operating rooms,

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
they have been on top of buildings.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
For example, this is the oldest operating room in the Western world,

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
in London,

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
where the operating room

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
is actually on top of a church

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
with a skylight coming in.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
And then this is a picture

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
of one of the most famous hospitals in America.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
This is Mass General in Boston.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
And do you know where the operating room is?

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
Here it is

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
on the top of the building

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
with plenty of windows to let light in.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
So nowadays in the operating room,

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
we no longer need to use sunlight.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
And because we no longer need to use sunlight,

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
we have very specialized lights

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
that are made for the operating room.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
We have an opportunity

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
to bring in other kinds of lights --

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
lights that can allow us to see

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
what we currently don't see.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
And this is what I think

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
is the magic of fluorescence.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
So let me back up a little bit.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
When we are in medical school,

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
we learn our anatomy from illustrations such as this

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000
where everything's color-coded.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
Nerves are yellow, arteries are red,

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
veins are blue.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000
That's so easy anybody could become a surgeon, right?

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
However, when we have a real patient on the table,

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
this is the same neck dissection --

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
not so easy to tell the difference

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
between different structures.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000
We heard over the last couple days

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
what an urgent problem

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
cancer still is in our society,

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
what a pressing need it is

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
for us to not have

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.000
one person die every minute.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
Well if cancer can be caught early,

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:56.000
enough such that someone can have their cancer taken out,

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
excised with surgery,

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
I don't care if it has this gene or that gene,

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
or if it has this protein or that protein,

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
it's in the jar.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000
It's done, it's out, you're cured of cancer.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
This is how we excise cancers.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000
We do our best, based upon our training

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000
and the way the cancer looks and the way it feels

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000
and its relationship to other structures and all of our experience,

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000
we say, you know what, the cancer's gone.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000
We've made a good job. We've taken it out.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
That's what the surgeon is saying in the operating room

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
when the patient's on the table.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.000
But then we actually don't know that it's all out.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.000
We actually have to take samples from the surgical bed,

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000
what's left behind in the patient,

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.000
and then send those bits to the pathology lab.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000
In the meanwhile, the patient's on the operating room table.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000
The nurses, anesthesiologist, the surgeon,

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000
all the assistants are waiting around.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000
And we wait.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000
The pathologist takes that sample,

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.000
freezes it, cuts it, looks in the microscope one by one

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000
and then calls back into the room.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000
And that may be 20 minutes later per piece.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
So if you've sent three specimens,

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
it's an hour later.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000
And very often they say,

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000
"You know what, points A and B are okay,

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000
but point C, you still have some residual cancer there.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.000
Please go cut that piece out."

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.000
So we go back and we do that again, and again.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000
And this whole process:

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000
"Okay you're done.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000
We think the entire tumor is out."

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.000
But very often several days later,

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.000
the patient's gone home,

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000
we get a phone call:

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000
"I'm sorry,

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000
once we looked at the final pathology,

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000
once we looked at the final specimen,

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000
we actually found that there's a couple other spots

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.000
where the margins are positive.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.000
There's still cancer in your patient."

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.000
So now you're faced with telling your patient, first of all,

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000
that they may need another surgery,

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000
or that they need additional therapy

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:53.000
such as radiation or chemotherapy.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000
So wouldn't it be better

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000
if we could really tell,

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000
if the surgeon could really tell,

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000
whether or not there's still cancer on the surgical field?

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000
I mean, in many ways, the way that we're doing it,

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:10.000
we're still operating in the dark.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.000
So in 2004, during my surgical residency,

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000
I had the great fortune

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000
to meet Dr. Roger Tsien,

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.000
who went on to win the Nobel Prize for chemistry

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000
in 2008.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000
Roger and his team

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.000
were working on a way to detect cancer,

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000
and they had a very clever molecule

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000
that they had come up with.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.000
The molecule they had developed

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000
had three parts.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.000
The main part of it is the blue part, polycation,

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000
and it's basically very sticky

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000
to every tissue in your body.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000
So imagine that you make a solution

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000
full of this sticky material

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.000
and inject it into the veins of someone who has cancer,

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000
everything's going to get lit up.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000
Nothing will be specific.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.000
There's no specificity there.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000
So they added two additional components.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.000
The first one is a polyanionic segment,

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000
which basically acts as a non-stick backing

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.000
like the back of a sticker.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.000
So when those two are together, the molecule is neutral

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.000
and nothing gets stuck down.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.000
And the two pieces are then linked

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.000
by something that can only be cut

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000
if you have the right molecular scissors --

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.000
for example, the kind of protease enzymes

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.000
that tumors make.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.000
So here in this situation,

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:27.000
if you make a solution full of this three-part molecule

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000
along with the dye, which is shown in green,

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.000
and you inject it into the vein

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000
of someone who has cancer,

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000
normal tissue can't cut it.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.000
The molecule passes through and gets excreted.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.000
However, in the presence of the tumor,

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.000
now there are molecular scissors

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.000
that can break this molecule apart

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000
right there at the cleavable site.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000
And now, boom,

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000
the tumor labels itself

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000
and it gets fluorescent.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.000
So here's an example of a nerve

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.000
that has tumor surrounding it.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000
Can you tell where the tumor is?

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.000
I couldn't when I was working on this.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.000
But here it is. It's fluorescent.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.000
Now it's green.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:10.000
See, so every single one in the audience

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.000
now can tell where the cancer is.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:16.000
We can tell in the operating room, in the field,

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.000
at a molecular level,

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.000
where is the cancer and what the surgeon needs to do

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.000
and how much more work they need to do

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:25.000
to cut that out.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.000
And the cool thing about fluorescence

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.000
is that it's not only bright,

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.000
it actually can shine through tissue.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:36.000
The light that the fluorescence emits

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.000
can go through tissue.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:41.000
So even if the tumor is not right on the surface,

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:44.000
you'll still be able to see it.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.000
In this movie, you can see

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:49.000
that the tumor is green.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:52.000
There's actually normal muscle on top of it. See that?

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000
And I'm peeling that muscle away.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.000
But even before I peel that muscle away,

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:59.000
you saw that there was a tumor underneath.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:02.000
So that's the beauty of having a tumor

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:05.000
that's labeled with fluorescent molecules.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.000
That you can, not only see the margins

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.000
right there on a molecular level,

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:12.000
but you can see it even if it's not right on the top --

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.000
even if it's beyond your field of view.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.000
And this works for metastatic lymph nodes also.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.000
Sentinel lymph node dissection

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:24.000
has really changed the way that we manage breast cancer, melanoma.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000
Women used to get

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000
really debilitating surgeries

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.000
to excise all of the axillary lymph nodes.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:34.000
But when sentinel lymph node

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:37.000
came into our treatment protocol,

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:40.000
the surgeon basically looks for the single node

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:43.000
that is the first draining lymph node of the cancer.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:46.000
And then if that node has cancer,

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.000
the woman would go on to get

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000
the axillary lymph node dissection.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.000
So what that means

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:55.000
is if the lymph node did not have cancer,

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.000
the woman would be saved

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.000
from having unnecessary surgery.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:02.000
But sentinel lymph node, the way that we do it today,

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000
is kind of like having a road map

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.000
just to know where to go.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.000
So if you're driving on the freeway

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.000
and you want to know where's the next gas station,

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:13.000
you have a map to tell you that that gas station is down the road.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.000
It doesn't tell you whether or not

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.000
the gas station has gas.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:20.000
You have to cut it out, bring it back home,

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.000
cut it up, look inside

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.000
and say, "Oh yes, it does have gas."

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.000
So that takes more time.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.000
Patients are still on the operating room table.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.000
Anesthesiologists, surgeons are waiting around.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.000
That takes time.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:35.000
So with our technology, we can tell right away.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:38.000
You see a lot of little, roundish bumps there.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:41.000
Some of these are swollen lymph nodes

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.000
that look a little larger than others.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:46.000
Who amongst us hasn't had swollen lymph nodes with a cold?

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.000
That doesn't mean that there's cancer inside.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.000
Well with our technology,

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:53.000
the surgeon is able to tell immediately

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.000
which nodes have cancer.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.000
I won't go into this very much,

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.000
but our technology, besides being able

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:03.000
to tag tumor and metastatic lymph nodes with fluorescence,

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:07.000
we can also use the same smart three-part molecule

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:10.000
to tag gadolinium onto the system

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.000
so you can do this noninvasively.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.000
The patient has cancer,

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.000
you want to know if the lymph nodes have cancer

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.000
even before you go in.

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:21.000
Well you can see this on an MRI.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.000
So in surgery,

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:26.000
it's important to know what to cut out.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.000
But equally important

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:31.000
is to preserve things

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:34.000
that are important for function.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:37.000
So it's very important to avoid inadvertent injury.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.000
And what I'm talking about

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.000
are nerves.

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.000
Nerves, if they are injured,

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.000
can cause paralysis,

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:48.000
can cause pain.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.000
In the setting of prostate cancer,

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.000
up to 60 percent of men

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:54.000
after prostate cancer surgery

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.000
may have urinary incontinence

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.000
and erectile disfunction.

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:01.000
That's a lot of people to have a lot of problems --

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:03.000
and this is even in

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:05.000
so-called nerve-sparing surgery,

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:09.000
which means that the surgeon is aware of the problem,

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.000
and they are trying to avoid the nerves.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:14.000
But you know what, these little nerves are so small,

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:17.000
in the context of prostate cancer,

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.000
that they are actually never seen.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.000
They are traced

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.000
just by their known anatomical path

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.000
along vasculature.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:29.000
And they're known because somebody has decided to study them,

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.000
which means that we're still learning

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:33.000
about where they are.

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:36.000
Crazy to think that we're having surgery,

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:39.000
we're trying to excise cancer, we don't know where the cancer is.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:42.000
We're trying to preserve nerves; we can't see where they are.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:44.000
So I said, wouldn't it be great

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:46.000
if we could find a way

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:49.000
to see nerves with fluorescence?

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:53.000
And at first this didn't get a lot of support.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.000
People said, "We've been doing it this way for all these years.

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:57.000
What's the problem?

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:00.000
We haven't had that many complications."

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.000
But I went ahead anyway.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.000
And Roger helped me.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:07.000
And he brought his whole team with him.

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:11.000
So there's that teamwork thing again.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:14.000
And we eventually discovered molecules

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.000
that were specifically labeling nerves.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.000
And when we made a solution of this,

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.000
tagged with the fluorescence

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:23.000
and injected in the body of a mouse,

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:25.000
their nerves literally glowed.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.000
You can see where they are.

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:31.000
Here you're looking at a sciatic nerve of a mouse,

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:34.000
and you can see that that big, fat portion you can see very easily.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:37.000
But in fact, at the tip of that where I'm dissecting now,

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:40.000
there's actually very fine arborizations

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:42.000
that can't really be seen.

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:46.000
You see what looks like little Medusa heads coming out.

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.000
We have been able to see nerves

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:51.000
for facial expression, for facial movement, for breathing --

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.000
every single nerve --

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:56.000
nerves for urinary function around the prostate.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:59.000
We've been able to see every single nerve.

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:03.000
When we put these two probes together ...

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:05.000
So here's a tumor.

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:08.000
Do you guys know where the margins of this tumor is?

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:11.000
Now you do.

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:14.000
What about the nerve that's going into this tumor?

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.000
That white portion there is easy to see.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.000
But what about the part that goes into the tumor?

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:20.000
Do you know where it's going?

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.000
Now you do.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.000
Basically, we've come up with a way

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.000
to stain tissue

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:28.000
and color-code the surgical field.

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:31.000
This was a bit of a breakthrough.

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:35.000
I think that it'll change the way that we do surgery.

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:37.000
We published our results

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:39.000
in the proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:41.000
and in Nature Biotechnology.

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:44.000
We received commentary in Discover magazine,

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:46.000
in The Economist.

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:49.000
And we showed it to a lot of my surgical colleagues.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:51.000
They said, "Wow!

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:53.000
I have patients

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.000
who would benefit from this.

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.000
I think that this will result in my surgeries

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:59.000
with a better outcome

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:02.000
and fewer complications."

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.000
What needs to happen now

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:07.000
is further development of our technology

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:09.000
along with development

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:11.000
of the instrumentation

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:13.000
that allows us to see

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:16.000
this sort of fluorescence in the operating room.

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.000
The eventual goal

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:21.000
is that we'll get this into patients.

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:24.000
However, we've discovered

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.000
that there's actually no straightforward mechanism

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.000
to develop a molecule

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.000
for one-time use.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:33.000
Understandably, the majority of the medical industry

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:37.000
is focused on multiple-use drugs,

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:40.000
such as long-term daily medications.

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:43.000
We are focused on making this technology better.

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:46.000
We're focused on adding drugs,

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.000
adding growth factors,

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:50.000
killing nerves that are causing problems

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:53.000
and not the surrounding tissue.

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:57.000
We know that this can be done and we're committed to doing it.

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:01.000
I'd like to leave you with this final thought.

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.000
Successful innovation

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:06.000
is not a single breakthrough.

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:09.000
It is not a sprint.

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:13.000
It is not an event for the solo runner.

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:15.000
Successful innovation

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:18.000
is a team sport, it's a relay race.

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:22.000
It requires one team for the breakthrough

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:24.000
and another team

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:26.000
to get the breakthrough accepted and adopted.

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:29.000
And this takes the long-term steady courage

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:31.000
of the day-in day-out struggle

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:34.000
to educate, to persuade

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:37.000
and to win acceptance.

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:39.000
And that is the light that I want to shine

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:41.000
on health and medicine today.

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:43.000
Thank you very much.

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:47.000
(Applause)
