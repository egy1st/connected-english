00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
I'm here to talk to you

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
about the economic invisibility of nature.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
The bad news

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
is that mother nature's back office isn't working yet,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
so those invoices don't get issued.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
But we need to do something about this problem.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
I began my life as a markets professional

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
and continued to take an interest,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
but most of my recent effort

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
has been looking at the value

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
of what comes to human beings from nature,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
and which doesn't get priced by the markets.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
A project called TEEB was started in 2007,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
and it was launched by a group of environment ministers

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
of the G8+5.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
And their basic inspiration

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
was a stern review of Lord Stern.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
They asked themselves a question:

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
If economics could make such a convincing case

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
for early action on climate change,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
well why can't the same be done for conservation?

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
Why can't an equivalent case be made

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
for nature?

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
And the answer is: Yeah, it can.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
But it's not that straightforward.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
Biodiversity, the living fabric of this planet, is not a gas.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
It exists in many layers,

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
ecosystems, species and genes across many scales --

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
international, national, local, community --

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
and doing for nature

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
what Lord Stern and his team did for nature is not that easy.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
And yet, we began.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
We began the project with an interim report,

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
which quickly pulled together

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
a lot of information that had been collected on the subject

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
by many, many researchers.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
And amongst our compiled results

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
was the startling revelation

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
that, in fact, we were losing natural capital --

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
the benefits that flow from nature to us.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
We were losing it at an extraordinary rate --

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
in fact, of the order of two to four trillion dollars-worth

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
of natural capital.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
This came out in 2008,

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
which was, of course, around the time that the banking crisis had shown

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
that we had lost financial capital

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
of the order of two and a half trillion dollars.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
So this was comparable in size to that kind of loss.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
We then have gone on since

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
to present for [the] international community,

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
for governments,

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
for local governments and for business

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
and for people, for you and me,

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
a whole slew of reports, which were presented at the U.N. last year,

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000
which address the economic invisibility of nature

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
and describe what can be done to solve it.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
What is this about?

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
A picture that you're familiar with --

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
the Amazon rainforests.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000
It's a massive store of carbon, it's an amazing store of biodiversity,

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
but what people don't really know

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
is this also is a rain factory.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
Because the northeastern trade winds,

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
as they go over the Amazonas,

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
effectively gather the water vapor.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
Something like 20 billion tons per day of water vapor

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000
is sucked up by the northeastern trade winds,

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000
and eventually precipitates in the form of rain

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000
across the La Plata Basin.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000
This rainfall cycle, this rainfall factory,

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
effectively feeds an agricultural economy

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
of the order of 240 billion dollars-worth

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
in Latin America.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000
But the question arises: Okay, so how much

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
do Uruguay, Paraguay, Argentina

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
and indeed the state of Mato Grosso in Brazil

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
pay for that vital input to that economy

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
to the state of Amazonas, which produces that rainfall?

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000
And the answer is zilch,

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000
exactly zero.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
That's the economic invisibility of nature.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
That can't keep going on,

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000
because economic incentives and disincentives are very powerful.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
Economics has become the currency of policy.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000
And unless we address

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000
this invisibility,

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000
we are going to get the results that we are seeing,

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.000
which is a gradual degradation and loss

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
of this valuable natural asset.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
It's not just about the Amazonas, or indeed about rainforests.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
No matter what level you look at,

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000
whether it's at the ecosystem level or at the species level or at the genetic level,

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000
we see the same problem again and again.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.000
So rainfall cycle and water regulation by rainforests

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000
at an ecosystem level.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000
At the species level,

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000
it's been estimated that insect-based pollination,

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.000
bees pollinating fruit and so on,

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.000
is something like 190 billion dollars-worth.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000
That's something like eight percent

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.000
of the total agricultural output globally.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
It completely passes below the radar screen.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.000
But when did a bee actually ever give you an invoice?

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.000
Or for that matter, if you look at the genetic level,

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.000
60 percent of medicines were prospected,

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.000
were found first as molecules in a rainforest or a reef.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000
Once again, most of that doesn't get paid.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000
And that brings me to another aspect of this,

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.000
which is, to whom should this get paid?

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000
That genetic material

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000
probably belonged, if it could belong to anyone,

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000
to a local community of poor people

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.000
who parted with the knowledge that helped the researchers to find the molecule,

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000
which then became the medicine.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000
They were the ones that didn't get paid.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000
And if you look at the species level,

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000
you saw about fish.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.000
Today, the depletion of ocean fisheries is so significant

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:45.000
that effectively it is effecting the ability of the poor,

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000
the artisanal fisher folk

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000
and those who fish for their own livelihoods,

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000
to feed their families.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000
Something like a billion people depend on fish,

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000
the quantity of fish in the oceans.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.000
A billion people depend on fish

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000
for their main source for animal protein.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000
And at this rate at which we are losing fish,

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000
it is a human problem of enormous dimensions,

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000
a health problem

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000
of a kind we haven't seen before.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000
And finally, at the ecosystem level,

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.000
whether it's flood prevention or drought control provided by the forests,

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000
or whether it is the ability of poor farmers

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000
to go out and gather leaf litter

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000
for their cattle and goats,

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000
or whether it's the ability of their wives

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000
to go and collect fuel wood from the forest,

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000
it is actually the poor

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000
who depend most on these ecosystem services.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000
We did estimates in our study

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000
that for countries like Brazil, India and Indonesia,

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.000
even though ecosystem services --

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.000
these benefits that flow from nature to humanity for free --

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000
they're not very big in percentage terms of GDP --

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000
two, four, eight, 10, 15 percent --

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.000
but in these countries, if we measure how much they're worth to the poor,

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000
the answers are more like

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.000
45 percent, 75 percent, 90 percent.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000
That's the difference.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.000
Because these are important benefits for the poor.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.000
And you can't really have a proper model for development

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.000
if at the same time you're destroying or allowing

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.000
the degradation of the very asset, the most important asset,

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.000
which is your development asset,

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000
that is ecological infrastructure.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000
How bad can things get?

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.000
Well here a picture of something called the mean species abundance.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000
It's basically a measure

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000
of how many tigers, toads, ticks or whatever on average

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.000
of biomass of various species are around.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000
The green represents the percentage.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.000
If you start green, it's like 80 to 100 percent.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000
If it's yellow, it's 40 to 60 percent.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000
And these are percentages versus the original state, so to speak,

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.000
the pre-industrial era, 1750.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000
Now I'm going to show you

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000
how business as usual will affect this.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.000
And just watch the change in colors

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.000
in India, China, Europe,

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000
sub-Saharan Africa

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.000
as we move on and consume global biomass

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:49.000
at a rate which is actually not going to be able to sustain us.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000
See that again.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000
The only places that remain green -- and that's not good news --

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.000
is, in fact, places like the Gobi Desert,

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.000
like the tundra and like the Sahara.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000
But that doesn't help because there were very few species

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000
and volume of biomass there in the first place.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000
This is the challenge.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:07.000
The reason this is happening

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:10.000
boils down, in my mind, to one basic problem,

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.000
which is our inability to perceive the difference

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.000
between public benefits

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.000
and private profits.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:19.000
We tend to constantly ignore public wealth

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.000
simply because it is in the common wealth,

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.000
it's common goods.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.000
And here's an example from Thailand

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:29.000
where we found that, because the value of a mangrove is not that much --

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:33.000
it's about $600 over the life of nine years that this has been measured --

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.000
compared to its value as a shrimp farm,

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.000
which is more like $9,600,

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:40.000
there has been a gradual trend to deplete the mangroves

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.000
and convert them to shrimp farms.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:46.000
But of course, if you look at exactly what those profits are,

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.000
almost 8,000 of those dollars

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.000
are, in fact, subsidies.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:53.000
So you compare the two sides of the coin

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.000
and you find that it's more like 1,200 to 600.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.000
That's not that hard.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.000
But on the other hand, if you start measuring,

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.000
how much would it actually cost

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.000
to restore the land of the shrimp farm

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.000
back to productive use?

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.000
Once salt deposition and chemical deposition

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.000
has had its effects,

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:12.000
that answer is more like $12,000 of cost.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.000
And if you see the benefits of the mangrove

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:17.000
in terms of the storm protection and cyclone protection that you get

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.000
and in terms of the fisheries, the fish nurseries,

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.000
that provide fish for the poor,

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.000
that answer is more like $11,000.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.000
So now look at the different lens.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.000
If you look at the lens of public wealth

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.000
as against the lens of private profits,

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000
you get a completely different answer,

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:34.000
which is clearly conservation makes more sense,

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.000
and not destruction.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.000
So is this just a story from South Thailand?

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.000
Sorry, this is a global story.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.000
And here's what the same calculation looks like,

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:46.000
which was done recently -- well I say recently, over the last 10 years --

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.000
by a group called TRUCOST.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000
And they calculated for the top 3,000 corporations,

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.000
what are the externalities?

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.000
In other words, what are the costs of doing business as usual?

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:57.000
This is not illegal stuff, this is basically business as usual,

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:00.000
which causes climate-changing emissions, which have an economic cost.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.000
It causes pollutants being issued, which have an economic cost,

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.000
health cost and so on.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.000
Use of freshwater.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.000
If you drill water to make coke near a village farm,

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.000
that's not illegal, but yes, it costs the community.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.000
Can we stop this, and how?

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:16.000
I think the first point to make is that we need to recognize natural capital.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:19.000
Basically the stuff of life is natural capital,

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:22.000
and we need to recognize and build that into our systems.

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.000
When we measure GDP

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.000
as a measure of economic performance at the national level,

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:29.000
we don't include our biggest asset at the country level.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.000
When we measure corporate performances,

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.000
we don't include our impacts on nature

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.000
and what our business costs society.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.000
That has to stop.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:40.000
In fact, this was what really inspired my interest in this phase.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.000
I began a project way back called the Green Accounting Project.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:44.000
That was in the early 2000s

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:47.000
when India was going gung-ho about GDP growth

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.000
as the means forward --

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.000
looking at China with its stellar growths of eight, nine, 10 percent

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.000
and wondering, why can we do the same?

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.000
And a few friends of mine and I

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.000
decided this doesn't make sense.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:00.000
This is going to create more cost to society and more losses.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.000
So we decided to do a massive set of calculations

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:05.000
and started producing green accounts for India and its states.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.000
That's how my interests began

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.000
and went to the TEEB project.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:12.000
Calculating this at the national level is one thing, and it has begun.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.000
And the World Bank has acknowledged this

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.000
and they've started a project called WAVES --

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.000
Wealth Accounting and Valuation of Ecosystem Services.

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.000
But calculating this at the next level,

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.000
that means at the business sector level, is important.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.000
And actually we've done this with the TEEB project.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:27.000
We've done this for a very difficult case,

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.000
which was for deforestation in China.

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:32.000
This is important, because in China in 1997,

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:35.000
the Yellow River actually went dry for nine months

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.000
causing severe loss of agriculture output

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.000
and pain and loss to society.

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.000
Just a year later the Yangtze flooded,

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:44.000
causing something like 5,500 deaths.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.000
So clearly there was a problem with deforestation.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:49.000
It was associated largely with the construction industry.

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.000
And the Chinese government responded sensibly

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:53.000
and placed a ban on felling.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.000
A retrospective on 40 years

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:59.000
shows that if we had accounted for these costs --

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.000
the cost of loss of topsoil,

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:03.000
the cost of loss of waterways,

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:06.000
the lost productivity, the loss to local communities

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.000
as a result of all these factors,

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.000
desertification and so on --

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.000
those costs are almost twice as much

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.000
as the market price of timber.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:17.000
So in fact, the price of timber in the Beijing marketplace

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.000
ought to have been three-times what it was

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:22.000
had it reflected the true pain and the costs

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.000
to the society within China.

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:27.000
Of course, after the event one can be wise.

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.000
The way to do this is to do it on a company basis,

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.000
to take leadership forward,

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:34.000
and to do it for as many important sectors which have a cost,

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.000
and to disclose these answers.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.000
Someone once asked me, "Who is better or worse,

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.000
is it Unilever or is it P&amp;G

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:43.000
when it comes to their impact on rainforests in Indonesia?"

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.000
And I couldn't answer because neither of these companies,

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:47.000
good though they are and professional though they are,

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:50.000
do not calculate or disclose their externalities.

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.000
But if we look at companies like PUMA --

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.000
Jochen Zeitz, their CEO and chairman,

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.000
once challenged me at a function,

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:59.000
saying that he's going to implement my project before I finish it.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:02.000
Well I think we kind of did it at the same time, but he's done it.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.000
He's basically worked the cost to PUMA.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.000
PUMA has 2.7 billion dollars of turnover,

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.000
300 million dollars of profits,

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.000
200 million dollars after tax,

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:13.000
94 million dollars of externalities, cost to business.

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:15.000
Now that's not a happy situation for them,

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:17.000
but they have the confidence and the courage

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:20.000
to come forward and say, "Here's what we are measuring.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.000
We are measuring it because we know

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:24.000
that you cannot manage what you do not measure."

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:26.000
That's an example, I think, for us to look at

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.000
and for us to draw comfort from.

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.000
If more companies did this,

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.000
and if more sectors engaged this as sectors,

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.000
you could have analysts, business analysts,

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:37.000
and you could have people like us and consumers and NGOs

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:40.000
actually look and compare the social performance of companies.

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:43.000
Today we can't yet do that, but I think the path is laid out.

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:45.000
This can be done.

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:47.000
And I'm delighted that the Institute of Chartered Accountants in the U.K.

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:49.000
has already set up a coalition to do this,

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:51.000
an international coalition.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:54.000
The other favorite, if you like, solution for me

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.000
is the creation of green carbon markets.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.000
And by the way, these are my favorites --

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.000
externalities calculation and green carbon markets.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:04.000
TEEB has more than a dozen separate groups of solutions

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:06.000
including protected area evaluation

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.000
and payments for ecosystem services

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:11.000
and eco-certification and you name it, but these are the favorites.

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:13.000
What's green carbon?

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:15.000
Today what we have is basically a brown carbon marketplace.

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:17.000
It's about energy emissions.

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:19.000
The European Union ETS is the main marketplace.

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:21.000
It's not doing too well. We've over-issued.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.000
A bit like inflation: you over-issue currency,

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:26.000
you get what you see, declining prices.

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:29.000
But that's all about energy and industry.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:31.000
But what we're missing is also some other emissions

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.000
like black carbon, that is soot.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:35.000
What we're also missing is blue carbon,

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:37.000
which, by the way, is the largest store of carbon --

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:39.000
more than 55 percent.

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:41.000
Thankfully, the flux, in other words, the flow of emissions

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:43.000
from the ocean to the atmosphere and vice versa,

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:45.000
is more or less balanced.

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.000
In fact, what's being absorbed

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:50.000
is something like 25 percent of our emissions,

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.000
which then leads to acidification

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:54.000
or lower alkalinity in oceans.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.000
More of that in a minute.

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:58.000
And finally, there's deforestation,

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:00.000
and there's emission of methane

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.000
from agriculture.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.000
Green carbon,

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:06.000
which is the deforestation and agricultural emissions,

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:08.000
and blue carbon

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:10.000
together comprise 25 percent of our emissions.

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:12.000
We have the means already in our hands,

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:14.000
through a structure, through a mechanism, called REDD Plus --

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.000
a scheme for the reduced emissions

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:19.000
from deforestation and forest degradation.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:22.000
And already Norway has contributed a billion dollars each

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:24.000
towards Indonesia and Brazil

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.000
to implement this Red Plus scheme.

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.000
So we actually have some movement forward.

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.000
But the thing is to do a lot more of that.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:33.000
Will this solve the problem? Will economics solve everything?

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:35.000
Well I'm afraid not.

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:38.000
There is an area that is the oceans, coral reefs.

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:40.000
As you can see,

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.000
they cut across the entire globe

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:44.000
all the way from Micronesia

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:47.000
across Indonesia, Malaysia, India, Madagascar

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:49.000
and to the West of the Caribbean.

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:51.000
These red dots, these red areas,

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:53.000
basically provide the food and livelihood

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:55.000
for more than half a billion people.

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:58.000
So that's almost an eighth of society.

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:01.000
And the sad thing is that, as these coral reefs are lost --

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.000
and scientists tell us

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:06.000
that any level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere above 350 parts per million

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:09.000
is too dangerous for the survival of these reefs --

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:11.000
we are not only risking the extinction

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:13.000
of the entire coral species, the warm water corals,

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:17.000
we're not only risking a fourth of all fish species which are in the oceans,

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:19.000
but we are risking the very lives and livelihoods

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:22.000
of more than 500 million people

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:25.000
who live in the developing world in poor countries.

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:28.000
So in selecting targets of 450 parts per million

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:31.000
and selecting two degrees at the climate negotiations,

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:34.000
what we have done is we've made an ethical choice.

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:37.000
We've actually kind of made an ethical choice in society

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:39.000
to not have coral reefs.

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:41.000
Well what I will say to you in parting

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:43.000
is that we may have done that.

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:45.000
Let's think about it and what it means,

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:47.000
but please, let's not do more of that.

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:49.000
Because mother nature only has that much
