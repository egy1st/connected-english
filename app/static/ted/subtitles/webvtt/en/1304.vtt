WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Ben Roche: So I'm Ben, by the way.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Homaro Cantu: And I'm Homaro.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
BR: And we're chefs. So when Moto

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
opened in 2004, people didn't really know

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
what to expect. A lot of people thought

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
that it was a Japanese restaurant, and

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
maybe it was the name, maybe it was

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
the logo, which was like a Japanese

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
character, but anyway, we had all these

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
requests for Japanese food, which is

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
really not what we did. And after about

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
the ten thousandth request for a maki roll,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
we decided to give the people

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
what they wanted. So this picture is

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
an example of printed food, and this was

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
the first foray into what we like to call

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
flavor transformation. So this is all

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
the ingredients, all the flavor of, you know,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
a standard maki roll, printed onto

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
a little piece of paper.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
HC: So our diners started to get bored

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
with this idea, and we decided to give them

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
the same course twice, so here we actually

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
took an element from the maki roll and

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
and took a picture of a dish and then

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
basically served that picture with the dish.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
So this dish in particular is basically

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
champagne with seafood.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
The champagne grapes that you see are

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
actually carbonated grapes. A little bit of

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
seafood and some crÃ¨me fraiche and the

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
picture actually tastes exactly like the dish. (Laughter)

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
BR: But it's not all just edible pictures.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
We decided to do something

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
a little bit different and transform flavors

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
that were very familiar -- so in this case,

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
we have carrot cake.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
So we take a carrot cake, put it

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
in a blender, and we have kind of like

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
a carrot cake juice, and then that went into

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
a balloon frozen in liquid nitrogen to create

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
this hollow shell of carrot cake

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
ice cream, I guess, and it comes off

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
looking like, you know,

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
Jupiter's floating around your plate.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
So yeah, we're transforming things into

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
something that you have absolutely

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
no reference for.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
HC: And here's something we have no

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
reference to eat. This is a cigar, and

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
basically it's a Cuban cigar made out of

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
a Cuban pork sandwich, so we take these

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
spices that go into the pork shoulder,

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
we fashion that into ash. We take

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
the sandwich and wrap it up in

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
a collard green, put an edible label

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
that bears no similarity to

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
a Cohiba cigar label, and we put it

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
in a dollar ninety-nine ashtray and charge

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
you about twenty bucks for it. (Laughter)

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
HC: Delicious.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
BR: That's not it, though.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
Instead of making foods that

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
look like things that you wouldn't eat,

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
we decided to make ingredients

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
look like dishes that you know.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
So this is a plate of nachos.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
The difference between our nachos

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
and the other guy's nachos,

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
is that this is actually a dessert.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
So the chips are candied,

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
the ground beef is made from chocolate,

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
and the cheese is made from a shredded

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
mango sorbet that gets shredded

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
into liquid nitrogen to look like cheese.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
And after doing all of this

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000
dematerialization and reconfiguring

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000
of this, of these ingredients, we realized

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
that it was pretty cool,

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
because as we served it, we learned that

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
the dish actually behaves like the real thing,

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000
where the cheese begins to melt.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
So when you're looking at this thing

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
in the dining room, you have this sensation

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
that this is actually a plate of nachos,

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
and it's not really until you begin tasting it

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
that you realize this is a dessert, and

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000
it's just kind of like a mind-ripper.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000
(Laughter)

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
HC: So we had been creating

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
all of these dishes out of a

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000
kitchen that was more like

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
a mechanic's shop than a kitchen, and

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
the next logical step for us was to install

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
a state-of-the-art laboratory,

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
and that's what we have here.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000
So we put this in the basement, and we

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000
got really serious about food, like

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
serious experimentation.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000
BR: One of the really cool things about

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
the lab, besides that we have a new

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000
science lab in the kitchen, is that,

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000
you know, with this new equipment, and

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000
this new approach, all these

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000
different doors to creativity that we never

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000
knew were there began to open, and so the

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000
experiments and the food and the dishes

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.000
that we created, they just kept going

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000
further and further out there.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000
HC: Let's talk about flavor transformation,

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000
and let's actually make some cool stuff.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000
You see a cow with its tongue hanging out.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000
What I see is a cow about to eat something

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.000
delicious. What is that cow eating?

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
And why is it delicious?

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000
So the cow, basically, eats three basic

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.000
things in their feed: corn, beets, and barley,

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000
and so what I do is I actually

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000
challenge my staff with these crazy,

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.000
wild ideas. Can we take what the cow

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000
eats, remove the cow, and then make

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000
some hamburgers out of that?

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000
And basically the reaction tends to be

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000
kind of like this. (Laughter)

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000
BR: Yeah, that's our chef de cuisine,

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000
Chris Jones. This is not the only guy

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
that just flips out when we assign

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000
a ridiculous task, but a lot of these ideas,

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000
they're hard to understand.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000
They're hard to just get automatically.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.000
There's a lot of research and a lot of

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.000
failure, trial and error -- I guess, more error --

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000
that goes into each and every dish,

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000
so we don't always get it right, and it takes

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000
a while for us to be able to explain that

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000
to people.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000
HC: So, after about a day of Chris and I

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000
staring at each other, we came up with

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000
something that was pretty close

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000
to the hamburger patty, and as you can

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000
see it basically forms like hamburger meat.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.000
This is made from three ingredients:

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000
beets, barley, corn, and so it

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000
actually cooks up like hamburger meat,

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000
looks and tastes like hamburger meat,

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.000
and not only that, but it's basically

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000
removing the cow from the equation.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.000
So replicating food, taking it into that

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000
next level is where we're going.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.000
(Applause)

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000
BR: And it's definitely the world's first

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000
bleeding veggie burger,

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.000
which is a cool side effect.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000
And a miracle berry, if you're not familiar

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000
with it, is a natural ingredient, and it

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.000
contains a special property.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000
It's a glycoprotein called miraculin,

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.000
a naturally occurring thing. It still freaks

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000
me out every time I eat it, but it has a

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000
unique ability to mask certain taste

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.000
receptors on your tongue, so that primarily

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000
sour taste receptors, so normally things

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.000
that would taste very sour or tart,

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.000
somehow begin to taste very sweet.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000
HC: You're about to eat a lemon,

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.000
and now it tastes like lemonade.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000
Let's just stop and think about the

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.000
economic benefits of something like that.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000
We could eliminate sugar across the board

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.000
for all confectionary products and sodas,

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000
and we can replace it with

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000
all-natural fresh fruit.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.000
BR: So you see us here cutting up

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.000
some watermelon. The idea with this

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.000
is that we're going to eliminate tons of

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.000
food miles, wasted energy,

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.000
and overfishing of tuna by creating tuna,

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.000
or any exotic produce or item

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.000
from a very far-away place,

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:28.000
with local, organic produce;

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000
so we have a watermelon from Wisconsin.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000
HC: So if miracle berries take sour things

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000
and turn them into sweet things,

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000
we have this other pixie dust

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.000
that we put on the watermelon, and it

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.000
makes it go from sweet to savory.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.000
So after we do that, we put it into

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.000
a vacuum bag, add a little bit of seaweed,

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.000
some spices, and we roll it, and this

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.000
starts taking on the appearance of tuna.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.000
So the key now is to make it

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000
behave like tuna.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000
BR: And then after a quick dip into some

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.000
liquid nitrogen to get that perfect sear,

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000
we really have something that looks,

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:04.000
tastes and behaves like the real thing.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:07.000
HC: So the key thing to remember here is,

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:10.000
we don't really care

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.000
what this tuna really is.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.000
As long as it's good for you and good for

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.000
the environment, it doesn't matter.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.000
But where is this going?

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.000
How can we take this idea of tricking your

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.000
tastebuds and leapfrog it into something

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.000
that we can do today that could be

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.000
a disruptive food technology?

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.000
So here's the next challenge.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000
I told the staff, let's just take a bunch

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000
of wild plants, think of them as

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.000
food ingredients. As long as they're

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000
non-poisonous to the human body,

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.000
go out around Chicago sidewalks,

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.000
take it, blend it, cook it and then

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.000
have everybody flavor-trip on it at Moto.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.000
Let's charge them a boatload of cash for this

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:49.000
and see what they think. (Laughter)

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.000
BR: Yeah, so you can imagine, a task

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.000
like this -- this is another one of those

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.000
assignments that the kitchen staff

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.000
hated us for. But we really had to almost

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:00.000
relearn how to cook in general,

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000
because these are ingredients, you know,

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000
plant life that we're, one, unfamiliar with,

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.000
and two, we have no reference for how

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.000
to cook these things because

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.000
people don't eat them.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000
So we really had to think about new, creative ways

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.000
to flavor, new ways to cook

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.000
and to change texture -- and that was

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.000
the main issue with this challenge.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:21.000
HC: So this is where we step into the future

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.000
and we leapfrog ahead.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.000
So developing nations

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.000
and first-world nations,

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.000
imagine if you could take these wild plants

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000
and consume them, food miles would

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.000
basically turn into food feet.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.000
This disruptive mentality of what food is

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:38.000
would essentially open up the encyclopedia

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.000
of what raw ingredients are, even if we just

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000
swapped out, say, one of these for flour,

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.000
that would eliminate so much energy

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.000
and so much waste.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.000
And to give you a simple example here as to

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000
what we actually fed these customers,

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.000
there's a bale of hay there

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.000
and some crab apples.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.000
And basically we took hay and crab apples

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.000
and made barbecue sauce out of those two ingredients.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.000
People swore they were eating

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:04.000
barbecue sauce, and this is free food.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:07.000
BR: Thanks, guys.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:13.000
(Applause)
