00:00:00.841 --> 00:00:03.007
I'm actually going to share
something with you

00:00:03.031 --> 00:00:05.928
I haven't talked about
probably in more than 10 years.

00:00:05.952 --> 00:00:08.976
So bear with me as I take you
through this journey.

00:00:09.622 --> 00:00:11.097
When I was 22 years old,

00:00:11.121 --> 00:00:14.623
I came home from work,
put a leash on my dog

00:00:14.647 --> 00:00:16.401
and went for my usual run.

00:00:17.353 --> 00:00:19.040
I had no idea that at that moment,

00:00:19.064 --> 00:00:20.976
my life was going to change forever.

00:00:21.675 --> 00:00:24.405
While I was preparing my dog for the run,

00:00:25.222 --> 00:00:28.372
a man was finishing drinking at a bar,

00:00:28.396 --> 00:00:30.737
picked up his car keys, got into a car

00:00:30.761 --> 00:00:32.293
and headed south,

00:00:32.317 --> 00:00:33.991
or wherever he was.

00:00:35.276 --> 00:00:36.824
I was running across the street,

00:00:36.848 --> 00:00:39.028
and the only thing
that I actually remember

00:00:39.052 --> 00:00:41.519
is feeling like a grenade
went off in my head.

00:00:42.218 --> 00:00:45.900
And I remember
putting my hands on the ground

00:00:45.924 --> 00:00:47.786
and feeling my life's blood

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:51.238
emptying out of my neck and my mouth.

00:00:53.218 --> 00:00:55.398
What had happened is, he ran a red light

00:00:55.422 --> 00:00:56.999
and hit me and my dog.

00:00:57.563 --> 00:00:59.585
She ended up underneath the car.

00:01:00.897 --> 00:01:02.458
I flew out in front of the car,

00:01:02.482 --> 00:01:04.672
and then he ran over my legs.

00:01:04.696 --> 00:01:06.918
My left leg got caught up
in the wheel well --

00:01:06.942 --> 00:01:08.215
spun it around.

00:01:11.192 --> 00:01:13.255
The bumper of the car hit my throat,

00:01:13.279 --> 00:01:14.779
slicing it open.

00:01:15.724 --> 00:01:17.690
I ended up with blunt chest trauma.

00:01:18.348 --> 00:01:22.341
Your aorta comes up behind your heart,
it's your major artery --

00:01:22.365 --> 00:01:27.202
and it was severed, so my blood
was gurgling out of my mouth.

00:01:27.226 --> 00:01:30.821
It foamed, and ... horrible things
were happening to me.

00:01:33.201 --> 00:01:34.891
I had no idea what was going on,

00:01:34.915 --> 00:01:36.566
but strangers intervened,

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:40.088
kept my heart moving, beating.

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.786
I say "moving," because it was quivering,

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.476
and they were trying to put
a beat back into it.

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.771
Somebody was smart
and put a Bic pen in my neck

00:01:48.795 --> 00:01:52.129
to open up my airway,
so I could get some air in there.

00:01:52.153 --> 00:01:53.476
And my lung collapsed,

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:56.475
so somebody cut me open
and put a pen in there as well,

00:01:56.499 --> 00:02:01.773
to stop that catastrophic
event from happening.

00:02:03.597 --> 00:02:05.793
Somehow I ended up at the hospital.

00:02:05.817 --> 00:02:07.080
I was wrapped in ice,

00:02:07.104 --> 00:02:10.122
and then eventually put
into a drug-induced coma.

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:14.591
Eighteen months later, I woke up.

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:17.476
I was blind, I couldn't speak

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:19.389
and I couldn't walk.

00:02:19.413 --> 00:02:21.245
I was 64 pounds.

00:02:25.285 --> 00:02:29.272
The hospital really has no idea
what to do with people like that.

00:02:29.296 --> 00:02:32.066
And in fact, they started
to call me a "gomer."

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:34.956
That's another story
we won't even get into.

00:02:36.433 --> 00:02:39.766
I had so many surgeries
to put my neck back together,

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:41.476
to repair my heart a few times.

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:44.018
Some things worked, some things didn't.

00:02:44.042 --> 00:02:45.933
I had lots of titanium put in me;

00:02:45.957 --> 00:02:47.369
cadaver bones,

00:02:47.393 --> 00:02:50.171
to try to get my feet
moving the right way.

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:52.395
And I ended up with a plastic nose,

00:02:52.419 --> 00:02:54.609
porcelain teeth
and all kinds of other things.

00:02:54.633 --> 00:02:57.011
But eventually,
I started to look human again.

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:00.930
But ...

00:03:03.841 --> 00:03:06.085
It's hard sometimes
to talk about these things,

00:03:06.109 --> 00:03:07.377
so bear with me.

00:03:08.293 --> 00:03:10.671
I had more than 50 surgeries.

00:03:10.695 --> 00:03:12.296
But who's counting?

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:14.103
(Laughter)

00:03:14.127 --> 00:03:17.374
So eventually, the hospital decided
it was time for me to go.

00:03:17.398 --> 00:03:20.232
They needed to open up
space for somebody else

00:03:20.256 --> 00:03:23.476
that they thought could come back

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:26.476
from whatever they were going through.

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:29.358
Everybody lost faith in me
being able to recover.

00:03:29.898 --> 00:03:32.937
So they basically put a map
up on the wall, threw a dart,

00:03:32.961 --> 00:03:35.956
and it landed at a senior home,
here in Colorado.

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:39.739
And I know all of you
are scratching your head:

00:03:39.763 --> 00:03:40.990
"A senior citizens' home?

00:03:41.014 --> 00:03:43.144
What in the world
are you going to do there?"

00:03:43.168 --> 00:03:45.599
But if you think about
all of the skills and talent

00:03:45.623 --> 00:03:48.171
that are in this room right now,

00:03:48.195 --> 00:03:50.234
that's what a senior home has.

00:03:50.258 --> 00:03:52.320
So there were all these skills and talents

00:03:52.344 --> 00:03:53.827
that these seniors had.

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:57.165
The one advantage
they had over most of you

00:03:57.189 --> 00:03:58.340
is wisdom,

00:03:58.364 --> 00:04:00.554
because they had a long life.

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:03.704
And I needed that wisdom
at that moment in my life.

00:04:04.355 --> 00:04:06.151
But imagine what it was like for them

00:04:06.175 --> 00:04:08.072
when I showed up at their doorstep.

00:04:09.017 --> 00:04:12.580
At that point, I had gained
four pounds, so I was 68 pounds.

00:04:13.001 --> 00:04:14.244
I was bald.

00:04:14.879 --> 00:04:16.886
I was wearing hospital scrubs.

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:19.577
And somebody donated tennis shoes for me.

00:04:19.601 --> 00:04:22.770
And I had a white cane in one hand

00:04:22.794 --> 00:04:25.802
and a suitcase full of medical
records in another hand.

00:04:26.183 --> 00:04:28.374
So the senior citizens realized

00:04:28.398 --> 00:04:30.690
that they needed to have
an emergency meeting.

00:04:30.714 --> 00:04:32.476
(Laughter)

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:35.476
So they pulled back
and they were looking at each other,

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:39.571
and they were going, "OK,
what skills do we have in this room?

00:04:39.595 --> 00:04:41.730
This kid needs a lot of work."

00:04:42.269 --> 00:04:47.078
So they eventually started
matching their talents and skills

00:04:47.102 --> 00:04:48.476
to all of my needs.

00:04:49.015 --> 00:04:51.175
But one of the first things
they needed to do

00:04:51.199 --> 00:04:53.374
was assess what I needed right away.

00:04:53.398 --> 00:04:56.537
I needed to figure out how to eat
like a normal human being,

00:04:56.561 --> 00:04:59.902
since I'd been eating
through a tube in my chest

00:04:59.926 --> 00:05:01.476
and through my veins.

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:04.703
So I had to go
through trying to eat again.

00:05:04.727 --> 00:05:06.476
And they went through that process.

00:05:06.909 --> 00:05:08.476
And then they had to figure out:

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:10.251
"Well, she needs furniture.

00:05:10.275 --> 00:05:13.356
She is sleeping in the corner
of this apartment."

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:15.476
So they went to their storage lockers

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:17.476
and all gathered their extra furniture --

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:19.641
gave me pots and pans, blankets --

00:05:21.038 --> 00:05:22.214
everything.

00:05:23.317 --> 00:05:26.795
And then the next thing that I needed

00:05:26.819 --> 00:05:27.985
was a makeover.

00:05:28.296 --> 00:05:29.446
(Laughter)

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:31.025
So out went the green scrubs,

00:05:31.049 --> 00:05:33.915
and in came the polyester
and floral prints.

00:05:33.939 --> 00:05:38.230
(Laughter)

00:05:38.254 --> 00:05:40.362
We're not going to talk
about the hairstyles

00:05:40.386 --> 00:05:43.464
they tried to force on me
once my hair grew back.

00:05:44.003 --> 00:05:45.738
But I did say no to the blue hair.

00:05:45.762 --> 00:05:47.895
(Laughter)

00:05:49.317 --> 00:05:52.993
So eventually, what went on is,

00:05:53.017 --> 00:05:55.897
they decided that, well,
I need to learn to speak.

00:05:55.921 --> 00:05:57.725
You can't be an independent person

00:05:57.749 --> 00:06:00.476
if you're not able to speak
and you can't see.

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:03.417
So they figured not being able
to see is one thing,

00:06:03.441 --> 00:06:05.019
but they need to get me to talk.

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:08.476
So while Sally, the office manager,

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:10.396
was teaching me to speak in the day --

00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:14.545
it's hard, because when you're a kid,
you take things for granted.

00:06:14.569 --> 00:06:16.266
You learn things unconsciously.

00:06:16.290 --> 00:06:19.757
But for me, I was an adult
and it was embarrassing,

00:06:19.781 --> 00:06:23.683
and I had to learn how to coordinate
my new throat with my tongue

00:06:23.707 --> 00:06:26.476
and my new teeth and my lips,

00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:28.971
and capture the air and get the word out.

00:06:28.995 --> 00:06:30.823
So, I acted like a two-year-old,

00:06:30.847 --> 00:06:32.583
and refused to work.

00:06:34.152 --> 00:06:36.640
But the men had a better idea.

00:06:36.664 --> 00:06:38.986
They were going to make it fun for me.

00:06:39.010 --> 00:06:42.785
So they were teaching me
cuss-word Scrabble at night.

00:06:42.809 --> 00:06:45.924
(Laughter)

00:06:47.112 --> 00:06:50.742
And then, secretly,
how to swear like a sailor.

00:06:50.766 --> 00:06:51.779
(Laughter)

00:06:51.803 --> 00:06:55.611
I'm going to just leave it
to your imagination

00:06:55.635 --> 00:06:58.151
as to what my first words were --

00:06:58.175 --> 00:06:59.166
(Laughter)

00:06:59.190 --> 00:07:02.167
when Sally finally got
my confidence built.

00:07:02.191 --> 00:07:04.380
(Laughter)

00:07:04.404 --> 00:07:06.404
So I moved on from there.

00:07:06.428 --> 00:07:09.604
And a former teacher
who happened to have Alzheimer's

00:07:09.628 --> 00:07:11.959
took on the task of teaching me to write.

00:07:13.356 --> 00:07:15.673
The redundancy was actually good for me.

00:07:15.697 --> 00:07:17.476
So, we'll just keep moving on.

00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:21.710
(Laughter)

00:07:24.369 --> 00:07:26.564
One of the pivotal times for me

00:07:26.588 --> 00:07:29.255
was actually learning
to cross the street again

00:07:29.279 --> 00:07:30.921
as a blind person.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:33.469
So close your eyes.

00:07:34.261 --> 00:07:37.155
Now imagine you have to cross a street.

00:07:37.179 --> 00:07:39.742
You don't know how far that street is,

00:07:40.861 --> 00:07:43.476
and you don't know
if you're going straight.

00:07:43.500 --> 00:07:46.059
And you hear cars whizzing back and forth,

00:07:46.908 --> 00:07:48.476
and you had a horrible accident

00:07:48.500 --> 00:07:50.793
that landed you in this situation.

00:07:51.293 --> 00:07:53.847
So there were two obstacles
I had to get through.

00:07:54.500 --> 00:07:57.289
One was post-traumatic stress disorder.

00:07:57.932 --> 00:08:01.693
Every time I approached
the corner or the curb,

00:08:01.717 --> 00:08:03.004
I would panic.

00:08:03.028 --> 00:08:04.829
And the second one

00:08:04.853 --> 00:08:07.987
was actually trying to figure out
how to cross that street.

00:08:08.500 --> 00:08:11.386
So one of the seniors just came up to me,

00:08:11.410 --> 00:08:14.742
and she pushed me
up to the corner and said,

00:08:14.766 --> 00:08:17.761
"When you think it's time to go,
just stick the cane out there.

00:08:17.785 --> 00:08:19.612
If it's hit, don't cross the street."

00:08:19.636 --> 00:08:25.131
(Laughter)

00:08:25.155 --> 00:08:26.580
Made perfect sense.

00:08:26.604 --> 00:08:27.741
(Laughter)

00:08:27.765 --> 00:08:31.354
But by the third cane
that went whizzing across the road --

00:08:31.378 --> 00:08:32.729
(Laughter)

00:08:32.753 --> 00:08:35.810
they realized that they needed
to put their resources together,

00:08:35.834 --> 00:08:37.304
and they raised funds

00:08:37.328 --> 00:08:39.415
so that I could go
to the Braille Institute

00:08:39.439 --> 00:08:44.036
and actually gain the skills
to be a blind person,

00:08:44.060 --> 00:08:46.058
and also to go get a guide dog,

00:08:46.082 --> 00:08:47.452
who transformed my life.

00:08:47.955 --> 00:08:49.724
And I was able to return to college

00:08:49.748 --> 00:08:53.476
because of the senior citizens
who invested in me,

00:08:53.500 --> 00:08:56.633
and also the guide dog
and skill set I had gained.

00:08:57.500 --> 00:08:59.770
Ten years later, I gained my sight back.

00:08:59.794 --> 00:09:01.183
Not magically --

00:09:01.865 --> 00:09:04.834
I opted in for three surgeries,

00:09:04.858 --> 00:09:06.728
and one of them was experimental.

00:09:06.752 --> 00:09:08.476
It was actually robotic surgery

00:09:08.500 --> 00:09:10.998
that removed a hematoma
from behind my eye.

00:09:13.096 --> 00:09:17.925
The biggest change for me
was that the world moved forward,

00:09:17.949 --> 00:09:21.991
that there were innovations
and all kinds of new things --

00:09:22.015 --> 00:09:23.944
cellphones, laptops,

00:09:23.968 --> 00:09:26.615
all these things
that I had never seen before.

00:09:26.639 --> 00:09:28.291
And as a blind person,

00:09:28.315 --> 00:09:30.834
your visual memory fades,

00:09:30.858 --> 00:09:34.876
and is replaced with how you
feel about things

00:09:34.900 --> 00:09:36.719
and how things sound

00:09:36.743 --> 00:09:38.100
and how things smell.

00:09:39.500 --> 00:09:41.986
So one day, I was in my room

00:09:42.010 --> 00:09:44.083
and I saw this thing sitting in my room.

00:09:44.107 --> 00:09:45.476
I thought it was a monster,

00:09:45.500 --> 00:09:47.615
so I was walking around it.

00:09:47.639 --> 00:09:49.641
And I go, "I'm just going to touch it."

00:09:49.665 --> 00:09:51.047
And I touched it and I went,

00:09:51.071 --> 00:09:53.189
"Oh my God, it's a laundry basket."

00:09:54.332 --> 00:09:57.214
(Laughter)

00:09:58.217 --> 00:10:02.253
Everything is different
when you're a sighted person,

00:10:02.277 --> 00:10:03.939
because you take that for granted.

00:10:03.963 --> 00:10:07.974
But when you're blind,
you have the tactile memory for things.

00:10:08.815 --> 00:10:11.364
The biggest change for me
was looking down at my hands

00:10:11.388 --> 00:10:14.208
and seeing that I'd lost
10 years of my life.

00:10:15.301 --> 00:10:18.360
I thought that time
had stood still for some reason

00:10:18.384 --> 00:10:20.218
and moved on for family and friends.

00:10:20.242 --> 00:10:21.726
But when I looked down,

00:10:21.750 --> 00:10:24.320
I realized that time
marched on for me, too,

00:10:24.344 --> 00:10:26.068
and that I needed to get caught up.

00:10:26.092 --> 00:10:27.567
So I got going on it.

00:10:29.167 --> 00:10:33.087
We didn't have words like "crowdsourcing"
and "radical collaboration"

00:10:33.111 --> 00:10:34.476
when I had my accident.

00:10:34.853 --> 00:10:36.616
But the concept held true --

00:10:36.640 --> 00:10:39.053
people working with people to rebuild me;

00:10:39.077 --> 00:10:41.886
people working with people
to reeducate me.

00:10:41.910 --> 00:10:43.727
I wouldn't be standing here today

00:10:43.751 --> 00:10:47.476
if it wasn't for extreme
radical collaboration.

00:10:47.500 --> 00:10:48.794
Thank you so much.

00:10:48.818 --> 00:10:52.301
(Applause)
