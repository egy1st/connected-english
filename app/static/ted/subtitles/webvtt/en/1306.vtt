WEBVTT

00:00:01.142 --> 00:00:02.897
So, my name is Roger Doiron,

00:00:02.921 --> 00:00:05.342
and I have a subversive plot.

00:00:05.366 --> 00:00:07.618
(Laughter)

00:00:07.642 --> 00:00:08.946
(Applause)

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:11.320
It is so subversive, in fact,

00:00:11.344 --> 00:00:15.468
that it has the potential
to radically alter the balance of power,

00:00:15.492 --> 00:00:17.547
not only in our own country,

00:00:17.571 --> 00:00:19.008
but in the entire world.

00:00:19.824 --> 00:00:21.379
Now I realize, I'm sounding --

00:00:21.403 --> 00:00:22.416
(Laughter)

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:25.196
a little bit like Dr. Evil now.

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:26.392
I understand that.

00:00:26.416 --> 00:00:29.202
But trust me -- we have very,
very little in common.

00:00:29.226 --> 00:00:32.887
His plots are all about
destruction and secrecy,

00:00:32.911 --> 00:00:35.939
whereas my plots are about
creation and openness.

00:00:35.963 --> 00:00:38.472
In fact, my plot can only work

00:00:38.496 --> 00:00:41.206
if I share it with as many
people as possible.

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:43.086
So I'm going to share it with you now,

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.948
but you have to promise me
you're going to share it in turn.

00:00:45.972 --> 00:00:47.269
So here it is.

00:00:47.293 --> 00:00:49.680
Huh. That's not so good, is it?

00:00:49.704 --> 00:00:53.419
There's nothing particularly radical
or revolutionary about a patch of grass.

00:00:53.443 --> 00:00:56.814
What starts to get interesting
is when we turn it into this.

00:00:57.759 --> 00:01:00.066
Now, I would like to suggest to you all

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.151
that gardening is a subversive activity.

00:01:03.175 --> 00:01:04.696
(Laughter)

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:07.678
Think about this:
food is a form of energy.

00:01:08.578 --> 00:01:09.928
It's what our body runs on,

00:01:09.952 --> 00:01:11.769
but it's also a form of power.

00:01:12.428 --> 00:01:15.842
And when we encourage people
to grow some of their own food,

00:01:15.866 --> 00:01:19.154
we're encouraging them
to take power into their hands,

00:01:19.178 --> 00:01:21.153
power over their diet,

00:01:21.177 --> 00:01:23.024
power over their health

00:01:23.048 --> 00:01:25.390
and some power over their pocketbooks.

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:29.679
So I think that's quite subversive,
because we're also necessarily

00:01:29.703 --> 00:01:32.630
talking about taking that power away

00:01:32.654 --> 00:01:33.874
from someone else,

00:01:34.496 --> 00:01:37.708
from other actors in society
that currently have power

00:01:37.732 --> 00:01:39.157
over food and health.

00:01:39.181 --> 00:01:41.652
You can think about
who those actors might be.

00:01:42.627 --> 00:01:46.491
I also look at gardening
as a sort of healthy gateway drug,

00:01:46.515 --> 00:01:49.879
you might say, to other forms
of food freedom.

00:01:49.903 --> 00:01:52.460
It's not long after you plant a garden

00:01:52.484 --> 00:01:55.960
that you start to say, "Hey,
I need to start to learn how to cook."

00:01:55.984 --> 00:01:58.484
(Laughter)

00:01:58.508 --> 00:02:01.292
"You know, I might want
to look into food preservation

00:02:01.316 --> 00:02:04.612
or I might want to look up
where my local farmer's market

00:02:04.636 --> 00:02:06.147
is located in my town."

00:02:07.076 --> 00:02:09.980
Now the other thing, of course,
with planting a garden,

00:02:10.004 --> 00:02:12.626
especially a garden
in front of a white house

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:14.604
and on a sunny south lawn,

00:02:14.628 --> 00:02:16.857
is you never know who you might influence.

00:02:16.881 --> 00:02:18.469
(Laughter)

00:02:18.493 --> 00:02:22.172
Now, I'm not exactly sure
what my white house garden's influence

00:02:22.196 --> 00:02:24.548
was on the First Lady's,

00:02:24.572 --> 00:02:25.815
but I can tell you this:

00:02:25.839 --> 00:02:28.040
she's had an enormous influence on me

00:02:28.064 --> 00:02:29.323
since planting hers.

00:02:29.347 --> 00:02:30.765
Now it hasn't been --

00:02:30.789 --> 00:02:34.092
(Laughter)

00:02:34.116 --> 00:02:36.193
it hasn't been in the area of fashion.

00:02:36.217 --> 00:02:40.314
I understand that she's just
in a completely different league there,

00:02:40.338 --> 00:02:42.259
and I'm not even trying to compete.

00:02:43.037 --> 00:02:46.465
But she's really inspired me
to think much more boldly

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:49.628
about the role that I want to have
in the garden movement.

00:02:50.189 --> 00:02:53.119
And so this is sort of
what I'm aspiring to here.

00:02:53.143 --> 00:02:55.663
(Laughter)

00:02:55.687 --> 00:02:57.880
Now, pretty modest, right?

00:02:58.472 --> 00:02:59.658
I like this picture.

00:02:59.682 --> 00:03:01.467
I think it sort of captures me well,

00:03:01.491 --> 00:03:03.834
not that I have any
divine connections whatsoever,

00:03:03.858 --> 00:03:06.619
but I like my facial expression there,

00:03:06.643 --> 00:03:09.380
because, if I've got
a worried look on my face,

00:03:09.404 --> 00:03:13.072
it's not simply because I've got
20 pounds of squash over my head,

00:03:13.096 --> 00:03:16.655
but it's because I've got some
pretty heavy topics on my mind.

00:03:16.679 --> 00:03:19.207
And I want to share some of those
with you right now,

00:03:19.231 --> 00:03:23.130
starting off in the form of a very
short video I've produced for you,

00:03:23.154 --> 00:03:27.541
which is my best effort
to sum up the history of gastronomy

00:03:27.565 --> 00:03:29.135
in about 15 seconds.

00:03:30.806 --> 00:03:34.572
("Also sprach Zarathustra" plays)

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:48.930
(Laughter)

00:03:52.862 --> 00:03:54.344
So, here we are.

00:03:54.368 --> 00:03:59.256
(Applause)

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:00.817
Now, that's a funny little clip,

00:04:00.841 --> 00:04:03.286
but it'd be even funnier
if it weren't so tragic

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:04.626
and if it weren't so true.

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:08.533
The reality is that we are in the midst
of an obesity epidemic,

00:04:08.557 --> 00:04:10.980
and it's not simply
limited to our country.

00:04:11.004 --> 00:04:13.182
It's spreading around the world right now.

00:04:13.206 --> 00:04:15.137
And in a sort of parallel universe,

00:04:15.161 --> 00:04:17.997
we're also seeing
that hunger is on the rise.

00:04:18.021 --> 00:04:21.631
Over 900 million people
right now are affected by it.

00:04:21.655 --> 00:04:24.537
That's three times the population
of the United States.

00:04:24.561 --> 00:04:25.837
But at the same time,

00:04:25.861 --> 00:04:27.589
world food prices are rising

00:04:28.571 --> 00:04:33.247
and world population is rising
and is set to reach 10 billion people

00:04:33.271 --> 00:04:34.843
by the end of the century.

00:04:34.867 --> 00:04:38.249
Now, another thing about the population
is we know that it's increasing,

00:04:38.273 --> 00:04:41.585
but a lot of us don't realize
that it's also changing.

00:04:41.609 --> 00:04:43.673
There's a fundamental shift taking place.

00:04:43.697 --> 00:04:48.520
As of 2007, we went from being
a primarily rural planet

00:04:48.544 --> 00:04:50.628
to being a primarily urban one,

00:04:50.652 --> 00:04:53.796
and that has implications
for how we're going to feed these people,

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:57.073
how we're going to get the food
to the people in the cities.

00:04:57.595 --> 00:05:00.116
Now, I imagine that there are
some Stephen King fans

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:01.310
in the audience here,

00:05:01.334 --> 00:05:02.939
and I'm one of them.

00:05:02.963 --> 00:05:07.318
But I can tell you, I haven't read
anything scarier than this here,

00:05:07.342 --> 00:05:08.668
and that's this statistic:

00:05:08.692 --> 00:05:12.356
in order to keep up
with the growing population,

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:16.656
we're going to need to grow more food
over the course of the next 50 years

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:21.447
than we have grown over the course
of the past 10,000 years combined.

00:05:22.326 --> 00:05:24.385
What makes this even more challenging

00:05:24.409 --> 00:05:28.433
is that we're going to need
to grow all this food with less,

00:05:28.457 --> 00:05:29.887
and when I say less,

00:05:29.911 --> 00:05:31.210
I mean a number of things.

00:05:31.234 --> 00:05:32.971
Less oil, for example.

00:05:32.995 --> 00:05:36.356
Most reputable geologists believe
that we've already reached

00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:38.294
peak oil production in the world.

00:05:38.318 --> 00:05:42.468
Now, you might not think in terms
of oil and food as being linked,

00:05:42.492 --> 00:05:44.766
but there's a very strong link, in fact.

00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:48.401
It takes 10 calories of fossil fuel energy

00:05:48.425 --> 00:05:50.723
in our highly industrialized food system

00:05:50.747 --> 00:05:53.357
in order to produce
one calorie of food energy.

00:05:54.294 --> 00:05:57.233
We'll also need to grow
more food with less water.

00:05:57.257 --> 00:06:00.544
These three images come from three
very different parts of the planet,

00:06:00.568 --> 00:06:04.402
but they all tell the same story
of catastrophic drought.

00:06:04.881 --> 00:06:07.729
We'll also need to grow
more food with less farmland.

00:06:07.753 --> 00:06:11.156
Here, the pressures differ
from one place to the next.

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:14.087
In the Global South,
we're seeing desertification,

00:06:14.111 --> 00:06:16.598
whereas in the north,
we're seeing suburban sprawl.

00:06:17.561 --> 00:06:21.284
We'll also have to grow more food
with less climate stability

00:06:21.308 --> 00:06:23.599
and less genetic diversity.

00:06:23.623 --> 00:06:25.106
Now, this is really important.

00:06:25.130 --> 00:06:27.067
We need our genetic varieties

00:06:27.091 --> 00:06:31.990
because they're a sort of insurance policy
against climate change.

00:06:32.014 --> 00:06:33.202
We heard earlier today

00:06:33.226 --> 00:06:35.495
"not putting all of our eggs
in one basket."

00:06:35.519 --> 00:06:39.131
Well, we shouldn't be doing
the same with our tomatoes, either.

00:06:39.155 --> 00:06:42.980
We're also going to need
to grow more food with less time.

00:06:43.358 --> 00:06:46.765
Now here, I'm not simply talking
about the ticking time bomb

00:06:46.789 --> 00:06:48.490
that is the global population.

00:06:48.514 --> 00:06:51.683
I'm talking about
the amount of time we all have

00:06:51.707 --> 00:06:54.240
in order to put
a decent meal on the table.

00:06:54.264 --> 00:06:57.522
And that "31" figure there
is not something arbitrary.

00:06:57.546 --> 00:07:01.285
That's the average amount of time
the American family spends

00:07:01.309 --> 00:07:05.094
preparing, eating and cleaning up
after meals per day.

00:07:06.824 --> 00:07:08.032
31 minutes.

00:07:08.056 --> 00:07:12.410
So somewhere in there, we're going
to need to also fit in growing food.

00:07:12.434 --> 00:07:13.592
Alright?

00:07:13.616 --> 00:07:15.441
And I think we do need to do that,

00:07:15.465 --> 00:07:18.312
but that's also going to mean
that somewhere along the way,

00:07:18.336 --> 00:07:19.985
something's going to have to give.

00:07:20.009 --> 00:07:22.983
So it sort of leaves us feeling like this.

00:07:23.007 --> 00:07:24.199
(Laughter)

00:07:24.223 --> 00:07:25.387
You know?

00:07:25.411 --> 00:07:27.971
It's time to leave town
or even perhaps leave planets.

00:07:27.995 --> 00:07:29.546
But where do we go?

00:07:29.570 --> 00:07:31.679
Where do we go
when we only have one planet?

00:07:31.703 --> 00:07:34.324
And where do we go
where the going gets tough?

00:07:34.348 --> 00:07:38.239
Well, if we were to listen to a lot
of our political leaders over the years,

00:07:38.263 --> 00:07:39.719
we would simply go shopping.

00:07:39.743 --> 00:07:41.115
Right?

00:07:41.139 --> 00:07:43.633
Because we have this unwavering belief,

00:07:43.657 --> 00:07:45.611
especially in American political culture,

00:07:45.635 --> 00:07:48.334
that we can shop our way
out of just about any problem.

00:07:49.114 --> 00:07:51.115
But the reality is something different.

00:07:51.139 --> 00:07:54.634
We're not going to solve
our food problems and our health problems

00:07:54.658 --> 00:07:57.929
simply by switching from regular Coke

00:07:57.953 --> 00:08:01.383
to some future green iteration thereof.

00:08:02.451 --> 00:08:07.642
And although the large food companies
would like us to believe

00:08:07.666 --> 00:08:11.328
that we can give our children
all of the vitamins, minerals

00:08:11.352 --> 00:08:13.819
and immunity-building
substances that they need

00:08:13.843 --> 00:08:16.505
without even leaving
the chocolatey cereal aisle --

00:08:16.529 --> 00:08:17.569
(Laughter)

00:08:17.593 --> 00:08:19.675
the truth is something quite different.

00:08:19.699 --> 00:08:22.487
Now, what's become
even more troublesome of late

00:08:22.511 --> 00:08:27.463
is that even the foods
that ought to be healthy aren't always so,

00:08:27.487 --> 00:08:30.689
and we're starting to lose confidence
in our food system, I think.

00:08:30.713 --> 00:08:34.024
The bigger it becomes
and the more complex it becomes.

00:08:34.048 --> 00:08:35.954
And we've seen this time and time again.

00:08:35.978 --> 00:08:39.609
This is an image
from the latest E. coli outbreak.

00:08:39.633 --> 00:08:41.304
In this case, it was in Europe,

00:08:41.328 --> 00:08:46.224
and we think it was started
with bean sprouts, of all things.

00:08:47.017 --> 00:08:50.010
So we have this sort of
shopper's dilemma right now.

00:08:50.034 --> 00:08:52.140
We have all of these different foods --

00:08:52.164 --> 00:08:56.330
30,000 foods in the average
big-box grocery store --

00:08:56.354 --> 00:08:58.815
but we have less confidence
in those foods,

00:08:58.839 --> 00:09:01.406
and we have less confidence in the actors

00:09:01.430 --> 00:09:03.584
that are putting those foods
on the shelves.

00:09:04.192 --> 00:09:06.583
I think we need to redefine
what good food is.

00:09:07.011 --> 00:09:09.515
This is an interesting image
from Berlin, Germany,

00:09:09.539 --> 00:09:12.945
where somebody started planting
shopping carts and leaving them around.

00:09:12.969 --> 00:09:14.521
Those are potatoes, by the way.

00:09:14.845 --> 00:09:17.404
But in addition to redefining
what good food is,

00:09:17.428 --> 00:09:19.991
I think we need to redefine
our living spaces.

00:09:20.015 --> 00:09:22.327
Instead of seeing this as a yard,

00:09:23.186 --> 00:09:26.742
we need to think of it more
as like a full-service greengrocer.

00:09:26.766 --> 00:09:29.795
That's, in fact, my yard,
and that's how I look at it.

00:09:29.819 --> 00:09:33.016
That's what we transformed our yard into,

00:09:33.040 --> 00:09:35.371
and I think a really key
message is this one:

00:09:35.395 --> 00:09:37.824
gardens grow good food.

00:09:38.330 --> 00:09:39.906
And when I say good food,

00:09:39.930 --> 00:09:41.661
I mean a number of different things.

00:09:41.685 --> 00:09:43.133
I mean food that is safe,

00:09:43.157 --> 00:09:44.589
food that is healthy,

00:09:44.613 --> 00:09:46.554
food that is absolutely gorgeous

00:09:46.578 --> 00:09:47.764
and delicious.

00:09:48.319 --> 00:09:50.530
Another important message is this one:

00:09:50.554 --> 00:09:53.303
gardens grow healthy kids and families.

00:09:53.327 --> 00:09:55.831
Those happen to be my two youngest sons,

00:09:55.855 --> 00:09:58.155
and they look healthy
and they are healthy,

00:09:58.179 --> 00:10:02.147
and I think it has to do with the fact
that they grew up in gardens

00:10:02.171 --> 00:10:04.491
and they know where good food comes from.

00:10:04.515 --> 00:10:07.993
And in fact, they know how
to grow some of it themselves.

00:10:08.017 --> 00:10:11.433
But in the current economy,
I think it's key to get this message out,

00:10:11.457 --> 00:10:16.065
that gardens also grow
important economic savings for families.

00:10:16.089 --> 00:10:18.817
And you can pretty much
take my word on this one,

00:10:18.841 --> 00:10:23.566
because in addition to crunching
the vegetables a couple of years ago,

00:10:23.590 --> 00:10:25.838
my wife and I also crunched the numbers,

00:10:25.862 --> 00:10:27.981
and we found out that at the end,

00:10:28.005 --> 00:10:31.715
we had saved well over 2,000 dollars
by growing our own food.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.162
So you could be asking this question now:

00:10:35.186 --> 00:10:39.441
If gardens grow all of these great things,
how do we grow more gardens?

00:10:39.465 --> 00:10:42.126
That's, in fact, the question
that my organization,

00:10:42.150 --> 00:10:43.620
Kitchen Gardens International,

00:10:43.644 --> 00:10:46.189
is both asking and answering.

00:10:46.213 --> 00:10:48.254
And our answer is essentially this one:

00:10:48.278 --> 00:10:52.368
we're going to need to leverage
the resources and power that we have,

00:10:52.392 --> 00:10:55.041
the gardens and gardeners that we have,

00:10:55.065 --> 00:10:58.028
in order to grow and inspire even more.

00:10:58.492 --> 00:11:01.858
And as I said before, you never know
who you might inspire.

00:11:01.882 --> 00:11:03.631
(Laughter)

00:11:03.655 --> 00:11:06.492
Now if this campaign was successful,

00:11:06.516 --> 00:11:11.115
I think it wasn't simply because we had
a visionary First Lady

00:11:11.139 --> 00:11:13.581
taking up residence at the White House --

00:11:13.605 --> 00:11:15.656
that certainly was a major part of it --

00:11:15.680 --> 00:11:18.912
and it wasn't simply because we had
some celebrity chefs and authors

00:11:18.936 --> 00:11:21.099
saying this would be a good idea to do.

00:11:21.123 --> 00:11:23.881
I think it was ultimately made possible

00:11:23.905 --> 00:11:27.233
by the fact that there were
a lot of people who wanted it to happen.

00:11:27.257 --> 00:11:29.445
There was a movement that made it happen.

00:11:29.469 --> 00:11:32.821
And my organization tried
to sort of channel some of that energy

00:11:32.845 --> 00:11:33.998
of the movement

00:11:34.022 --> 00:11:36.309
and direct it towards the White House.

00:11:36.333 --> 00:11:37.525
And we had a lot of luck

00:11:37.549 --> 00:11:40.185
in terms of getting our message
out there to the media.

00:11:40.209 --> 00:11:43.731
We had a petition on Facebook,
110,000 signatures.

00:11:43.755 --> 00:11:46.202
We had viral images and videos,

00:11:46.226 --> 00:11:50.064
and we did crazy things like
symbolically putting the White House lawn

00:11:50.088 --> 00:11:52.259
up for sale on eBay.

00:11:53.141 --> 00:11:54.528
But we need to do even more,

00:11:54.552 --> 00:11:56.763
and what we're trying to do
in my organization

00:11:56.787 --> 00:11:58.128
is to connect people online,

00:11:58.152 --> 00:12:00.308
but also to connect people in person.

00:12:00.332 --> 00:12:03.296
This is an image from a little
holiday we invented

00:12:03.320 --> 00:12:05.289
called "World Kitchen Garden Day."

00:12:05.313 --> 00:12:07.274
It's at the end of August each year,

00:12:07.298 --> 00:12:09.907
and it's just about bringing
people together in gardens

00:12:09.931 --> 00:12:11.327
to learn from one another,

00:12:11.351 --> 00:12:14.119
to experience a garden
as a community experience.

00:12:14.143 --> 00:12:16.935
We also need to grow
the next generation of gardeners,

00:12:16.959 --> 00:12:19.566
and we're doing that
in the United States and abroad.

00:12:20.110 --> 00:12:23.164
But there's still so much more
that needs to be done,

00:12:23.188 --> 00:12:26.205
and I think this slide sort of captures
where we need to go.

00:12:26.229 --> 00:12:27.549
We need a road map,

00:12:27.573 --> 00:12:29.357
and I picked this slide for a reason.

00:12:29.381 --> 00:12:31.094
We've got a bike garden on the left

00:12:31.118 --> 00:12:33.160
and a map of the Netherlands on the right.

00:12:33.184 --> 00:12:35.172
I was in the Netherlands early this year

00:12:35.196 --> 00:12:39.168
and was absolutely amazed
by the amount of bikes on the road;

00:12:39.192 --> 00:12:42.874
26 percent of all trips taken
in the Netherlands are by bicycle,

00:12:42.898 --> 00:12:44.250
and it's gotten me thinking:

00:12:44.274 --> 00:12:47.212
How do we get that happening
in terms of food and gardens?

00:12:47.236 --> 00:12:50.962
How would we get 26 percent of all produce
coming from backyard gardens?

00:12:50.986 --> 00:12:52.657
That might sound like a lot,

00:12:52.681 --> 00:12:55.840
because we're probably at about
two percent at the most right now.

00:12:55.864 --> 00:12:57.537
But if you take into consideration

00:12:57.561 --> 00:13:00.842
that at the peak of the victory garden
movement last century,

00:13:00.866 --> 00:13:04.149
40 percent of all produce
was coming from gardens.

00:13:04.173 --> 00:13:06.147
We can get there again.

00:13:06.171 --> 00:13:08.135
And I think this is a really good start.

00:13:08.159 --> 00:13:11.030
The White House garden
is certainly very inspirational.

00:13:11.054 --> 00:13:14.222
That's actually sort of a snapshot
of what the garden looked like

00:13:14.246 --> 00:13:16.270
when it was planted earlier this spring --

00:13:16.294 --> 00:13:19.034
lots of diversity, lots of healthy crops.

00:13:19.058 --> 00:13:22.002
However, this is not a good representation

00:13:22.026 --> 00:13:23.895
of our federal agriculture policy.

00:13:23.919 --> 00:13:25.480
(Laughter)

00:13:25.504 --> 00:13:30.183
If we were to take the model here,
the diagram of that particular garden,

00:13:30.207 --> 00:13:34.647
and sort of transpose it
onto our federal agriculture policy,

00:13:34.671 --> 00:13:35.907
we'd get this:

00:13:36.759 --> 00:13:39.726
billions of billions of dollars
going to support

00:13:39.750 --> 00:13:42.258
just a handful of commodity crops

00:13:43.032 --> 00:13:46.795
with just that tiny little bit at the top
for fruits and vegetables.

00:13:46.819 --> 00:13:49.439
This is scandalous. This is scandalous.

00:13:49.463 --> 00:13:51.435
We need to do something about this.

00:13:53.774 --> 00:13:57.493
I think one place we could start
is we could look at the tax code.

00:13:57.517 --> 00:14:01.291
We're already using the tax code
to encourage green transport

00:14:01.315 --> 00:14:02.679
and green shelter.

00:14:02.703 --> 00:14:04.046
Why not green food?

00:14:04.070 --> 00:14:07.344
We're in the midst now of talking
about another stimulus package.

00:14:07.368 --> 00:14:10.122
Why not a garden stimulus package?

00:14:10.146 --> 00:14:11.322
Why not?

00:14:11.346 --> 00:14:14.100
(Applause)

00:14:19.395 --> 00:14:21.839
In terms of other things
that we need to be doing,

00:14:21.863 --> 00:14:23.801
we need to move down to the local level

00:14:23.825 --> 00:14:26.276
and we need to make sure
that gardens are legal.

00:14:26.300 --> 00:14:28.387
This is an illegal garden.
At least it was.

00:14:28.411 --> 00:14:30.268
It's from Michigan earlier this year.

00:14:30.292 --> 00:14:33.219
It was planted by a woman,
a mother of four,

00:14:33.243 --> 00:14:36.508
and she nearly faced
a 93-day jail sentence

00:14:36.532 --> 00:14:38.745
because she planted it in her front yard.

00:14:39.175 --> 00:14:43.320
We still have laws from the 20th century.

00:14:43.344 --> 00:14:49.058
We need to bring our codes up
to the realities that we are facing now.

00:14:49.082 --> 00:14:52.851
We need to figure out also
new ways of getting people into gardens,

00:14:52.875 --> 00:14:54.402
people who don't have yards.

00:14:55.223 --> 00:14:58.984
I think we also need to set
garden entrepreneurism free,

00:14:59.008 --> 00:15:01.242
and I'm happy to say, as a Mainer,

00:15:01.266 --> 00:15:03.629
that we are leading the way in this area.

00:15:03.653 --> 00:15:06.110
Earlier this year, a number of Maine towns

00:15:06.134 --> 00:15:08.525
passed local food sovereignty laws

00:15:08.549 --> 00:15:11.485
that allow town residents
to not only grow food

00:15:11.509 --> 00:15:12.830
where they want to grow it

00:15:12.854 --> 00:15:15.727
but to also sell it
the way they want to sell it

00:15:15.751 --> 00:15:17.838
and to the people they want to sell it to.

00:15:17.862 --> 00:15:19.689
I think that's an incentive.

00:15:19.713 --> 00:15:21.547
There are a lot of gardeners out there

00:15:21.571 --> 00:15:24.928
that would be interested in scaling up
their production if they could,

00:15:24.952 --> 00:15:26.803
if they had a financial incentive.

00:15:27.247 --> 00:15:29.428
I also think that we need to examine

00:15:29.452 --> 00:15:32.454
the composition of the movement right now.

00:15:32.478 --> 00:15:34.750
(Laughter)

00:15:34.774 --> 00:15:38.239
If the movement were a 1960s beach flick,

00:15:38.263 --> 00:15:40.033
it would be "Where The Boys Aren't."

00:15:40.057 --> 00:15:41.074
(Laughter)

00:15:41.098 --> 00:15:43.327
So I'm going to take you to task, guys.

00:15:43.351 --> 00:15:47.656
It's not right and it's not fair
that the burden of this responsibility --

00:15:47.680 --> 00:15:49.411
feeding our country and the world --

00:15:49.435 --> 00:15:50.680
should be with the women.

00:15:50.704 --> 00:15:51.878
OK?

00:15:51.902 --> 00:15:55.119
(Applause)

00:15:55.143 --> 00:15:56.924
And I'm going to challenge the women

00:15:56.948 --> 00:15:59.916
to come up with really clever,
creative ways of getting guys

00:15:59.940 --> 00:16:01.205
into the gardens, too.

00:16:01.229 --> 00:16:02.576
(Laughter)

00:16:02.600 --> 00:16:04.192
Perhaps wearing a bathing suit?

00:16:04.216 --> 00:16:06.704
(Laughter)

00:16:06.728 --> 00:16:10.248
But beyond that, I think we need
to reexamine the infrastructure

00:16:10.272 --> 00:16:11.948
that we have in place for gardens.

00:16:11.972 --> 00:16:14.255
I think we need to create
new infrastructure.

00:16:14.279 --> 00:16:18.053
And this is one of the things
my organization is working on right now,

00:16:18.077 --> 00:16:22.961
sort of a local communications
infrastructure, very place-based,

00:16:22.985 --> 00:16:26.651
that allows people in the same area
to connect with one another

00:16:26.675 --> 00:16:28.794
and to help each other out.

00:16:29.128 --> 00:16:31.236
I think we're lacking this
at the moment --

00:16:31.260 --> 00:16:32.865
(Laughter)

00:16:32.889 --> 00:16:34.237
but we can do it.

00:16:34.261 --> 00:16:36.279
The technology is certainly there.

00:16:36.303 --> 00:16:39.554
In addition to that, I think we need
another type of infrastructure.

00:16:39.578 --> 00:16:41.757
It would be good if we could
all get together.

00:16:41.781 --> 00:16:45.100
I think if we've learned anything
through the TED experience,

00:16:45.124 --> 00:16:47.860
it's that there is power
when we bring people together,

00:16:47.884 --> 00:16:51.297
and I think we need to bring people
together at the local level as well.

00:16:51.321 --> 00:16:54.519
And I think we can take some inspiration
from a previous movement,

00:16:54.543 --> 00:16:55.980
which was the grange movement,

00:16:56.004 --> 00:17:00.557
a rural movement which brought farmers
together in a single building

00:17:00.581 --> 00:17:04.011
to meet and to recreate
and learn how to become better farmers.

00:17:04.035 --> 00:17:05.969
I think we need a network

00:17:05.993 --> 00:17:08.088
of suburban granges now.

00:17:09.916 --> 00:17:12.086
I think one of the last
things that we need

00:17:12.110 --> 00:17:14.804
is to not lose the fun of food.

00:17:14.828 --> 00:17:20.287
Food is at its best when it's delicious
but shared as part of a community,

00:17:20.311 --> 00:17:24.698
and I think that gardens can get
some of that community vibe back as well.

00:17:24.722 --> 00:17:27.314
So I'm going to leave with one last video,

00:17:27.338 --> 00:17:31.378
and I'm going to revisit the short video
that I showed you before,

00:17:31.402 --> 00:17:35.434
but I'm going to suggest
an alternative ending.

00:17:35.458 --> 00:17:38.213
And I think this ending
is well within our reach,

00:17:38.237 --> 00:17:41.097
but it's really going to require
that we all pull together.

00:17:41.121 --> 00:17:44.011
So here's the new history of gastronomy.

00:17:45.750 --> 00:17:48.165
("Also sprach Zarathustra" plays)

00:18:02.456 --> 00:18:07.807
(Applause)

00:18:24.944 --> 00:18:30.420
(Applause and cheers)

00:18:33.692 --> 00:18:35.835
Thank you very much.
Thank you all. Thank you.
