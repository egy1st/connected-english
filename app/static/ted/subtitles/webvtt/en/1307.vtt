00:00:01.037 --> 00:00:03.001
I hope you're all healthy,

00:00:03.025 --> 00:00:07.202
and I hope we will all remain healthy
for the indefinite future.

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:10.570
But that hope is a little bit unrealistic,

00:00:10.594 --> 00:00:12.560
and so I've got a second back-up hope.

00:00:12.584 --> 00:00:16.722
The second back-up hope is that,
insofar as we have health problems,

00:00:16.746 --> 00:00:20.081
we will have good medicines
to take care of them.

00:00:20.105 --> 00:00:24.473
Medicines are very cheap to produce
and they're very effective --

00:00:24.497 --> 00:00:27.640
much more pleasant, actually,
than the alternatives:

00:00:27.664 --> 00:00:31.716
hospitalization, operations,
emergency rooms, the morgue ...

00:00:32.271 --> 00:00:33.837
None of these are good things.

00:00:33.861 --> 00:00:37.452
So we should be very grateful
that we have pharmacologists around,

00:00:37.476 --> 00:00:40.393
people who research these things
and develop new medicines.

00:00:41.013 --> 00:00:44.776
And we should be grateful
that we have a pharmaceutical industry

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:46.891
that supports their activities.

00:00:47.599 --> 00:00:50.634
But there is a problem,
and you can tell from the fact

00:00:50.658 --> 00:00:53.108
that the pharmaceutical
industry isn't well-loved.

00:00:53.132 --> 00:00:58.092
In fact, in terms of popularity, they rank
just about with the tobacco companies

00:00:58.116 --> 00:00:59.856
and the arms manufacturers.

00:01:00.352 --> 00:01:04.170
So that's the problem
I want to talk with you about today.

00:01:05.384 --> 00:01:08.187
How would you organize
the pharmaceutical industry?

00:01:08.211 --> 00:01:10.613
If we did it all over again,
how would you do it?

00:01:10.637 --> 00:01:13.738
I think we would think
of three main principles.

00:01:14.202 --> 00:01:15.369
The first one is:

00:01:15.393 --> 00:01:19.739
we want patients to have access
to all the important medicines.

00:01:19.763 --> 00:01:22.537
Remember, these things
are very cheap to produce.

00:01:22.561 --> 00:01:25.286
So everybody in the world
should have access

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:27.604
to all the important medicines.

00:01:28.081 --> 00:01:30.989
Secondly, we want innovative activities,

00:01:31.013 --> 00:01:34.845
the research and development
that pharmaceutical companies do,

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:38.547
to track the diseases that are
the most important, the most damaging.

00:01:38.571 --> 00:01:41.642
We want them to aim
for the greatest health impact.

00:01:42.256 --> 00:01:45.546
And thirdly, we want
the whole system to be efficient.

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:50.398
We want as little of the money
that goes into the system to go to waste,

00:01:50.422 --> 00:01:53.928
to go for overhead,
for red tape, and so on and so forth.

00:01:54.484 --> 00:01:56.422
Very simple three points.

00:01:57.636 --> 00:01:59.596
Now what about the existing system?

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:03.219
I think it does poorly
on all these three counts.

00:02:03.243 --> 00:02:05.834
First, universal access: forget about it.

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:10.532
The vast majority of human beings
do not have access to medicines,

00:02:10.556 --> 00:02:12.909
at least while they're still under patent.

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:17.925
There are extremely high markups,
and that's the problem.

00:02:17.949 --> 00:02:21.878
The problem is that even though
these medicines are very cheap to produce,

00:02:21.902 --> 00:02:26.267
they cost a great amount of money
during the time that they're under patent,

00:02:26.291 --> 00:02:31.004
and the reason for that is
that rich people can pay a lot of money.

00:02:31.028 --> 00:02:33.620
Pharmaceutical companies
have a temporary monopoly;

00:02:33.644 --> 00:02:36.688
they price for the rich,
they forget about the poor.

00:02:37.334 --> 00:02:39.629
The second problem is innovation.

00:02:40.082 --> 00:02:44.655
Again, we don't focus on the diseases
that do the most damage,

00:02:44.679 --> 00:02:49.378
and that's often put
into the phrase "the 10/90 gap."

00:02:49.402 --> 00:02:53.085
Ten percent of all the money spent
on pharmaceutical research

00:02:53.109 --> 00:02:56.236
is focusing on diseases
that account for ninety percent

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:58.372
of the global burden of disease.

00:02:58.396 --> 00:03:02.114
And vice versa -- ninety percent
of the money is spent on diseases

00:03:02.138 --> 00:03:05.777
that account for only ten percent
of the global burden of disease.

00:03:05.801 --> 00:03:10.498
So there's a huge mismatch between
where we spend the research money

00:03:10.522 --> 00:03:13.159
and where the greatest problems are.

00:03:13.778 --> 00:03:15.174
Now, both these problems --

00:03:15.198 --> 00:03:17.943
the problem with innovation
and the problem with access --

00:03:17.967 --> 00:03:19.382
have to do with this:

00:03:20.118 --> 00:03:22.041
the distribution of money in the world.

00:03:22.065 --> 00:03:23.358
It's extremely unequal.

00:03:23.382 --> 00:03:27.721
The blue area here is the top quarter
of the human population.

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:31.838
They have more than ninety percent
of the global household income.

00:03:32.399 --> 00:03:34.876
The bottom half of humanity,
on the other hand,

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:38.199
has not even three percent
of global household income.

00:03:38.223 --> 00:03:42.658
So if you're a pharmaceutical company
and you look for profit opportunities,

00:03:42.682 --> 00:03:45.628
you look at this sort of chart and say,
"Where's the money?

00:03:45.652 --> 00:03:47.235
What am I going to research?

00:03:47.259 --> 00:03:49.649
Who am I going to provide with medicines?"

00:03:50.982 --> 00:03:54.734
And again, that is in the context
of there being only one way

00:03:54.758 --> 00:03:58.183
in which pharmaceutical companies
make money under the present system,

00:03:58.207 --> 00:04:00.379
that is, through patent-protected markups.

00:04:00.403 --> 00:04:02.822
That's how they make their money,
through markups.

00:04:02.846 --> 00:04:04.889
And if you make money through markups,

00:04:04.913 --> 00:04:09.740
then obviously, you will go to where
the people have the most income.

00:04:11.232 --> 00:04:12.974
Now in terms of overall efficiency,

00:04:12.998 --> 00:04:15.951
the system also does very, very poorly.

00:04:16.553 --> 00:04:19.144
A lot of money goes
for lobbying politicians

00:04:19.168 --> 00:04:22.901
in order to extend patent periods --
to "evergreen," as it's called.

00:04:22.925 --> 00:04:24.613
Data exclusivity and so on.

00:04:24.637 --> 00:04:26.147
A lot of money goes for gaming,

00:04:26.171 --> 00:04:32.019
where brand-name companies pay generic
companies to delay entry, for example.

00:04:32.043 --> 00:04:35.938
A lot of money goes to take our patents
in all the different jurisdictions.

00:04:35.962 --> 00:04:38.532
Money goes – even larger
amounts – for litigation.

00:04:38.556 --> 00:04:40.108
They're litigating endlessly --

00:04:40.132 --> 00:04:42.306
brand-name company
against brand-name company,

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:44.631
brand-name company
against generic company ...

00:04:44.655 --> 00:04:46.044
Enormous amounts go there.

00:04:46.068 --> 00:04:49.137
People say pharmaceutical companies
make a lot of profit.

00:04:49.161 --> 00:04:54.046
Well, yes and no; they do, but a lot of it
goes to these wasteful activities.

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:56.817
Deadweight losses -- I won't
even tell you what they are,

00:04:56.841 --> 00:04:58.268
because it's too complicated.

00:04:58.292 --> 00:05:00.899
But there's also wasteful marketing.

00:05:00.923 --> 00:05:04.176
A lot of the money
that pharmaceutical companies make

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:05.972
goes into advertising campaigns,

00:05:05.996 --> 00:05:07.749
trying to win favor with doctors,

00:05:07.773 --> 00:05:10.418
trying to persuade patients
to try this medicine.

00:05:10.858 --> 00:05:13.623
And these marketing battles,
of course, are a pure waste,

00:05:13.647 --> 00:05:16.932
because what one company spends
to get patients over to their drug,

00:05:16.956 --> 00:05:18.938
another company spends to win them back.

00:05:19.341 --> 00:05:22.222
And then there is counterfeiting
in the developing countries.

00:05:22.246 --> 00:05:25.627
A lot of the drugs there, often more than
fifty percent of what's sold,

00:05:25.651 --> 00:05:27.619
are counterfeit drugs, where people say,

00:05:27.643 --> 00:05:31.038
"Because the drug is so expensive,
I can offer you a cheaper version."

00:05:31.062 --> 00:05:32.958
But of course it's not the real thing,

00:05:32.982 --> 00:05:35.548
it's either diluted
or it's completely inert.

00:05:35.572 --> 00:05:39.250
So on the whole, all the money
that is spent on pharmaceuticals --

00:05:39.274 --> 00:05:42.586
and it's roughly a trillion dollars
now, per annum --

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:45.597
much of that money
is absolutely going to waste,

00:05:45.621 --> 00:05:47.716
it's not going to where
it should be going,

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:50.066
namely, to the development
of new medicines

00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:53.114
and to the manufacturing
of ones that we already have.

00:05:54.061 --> 00:05:56.634
Now, many people think
that the solution to the problem

00:05:56.658 --> 00:05:59.592
is moral pressure
on pharmaceutical companies.

00:06:00.719 --> 00:06:04.022
And, sure -- pharmaceutical companies
have moral obligations,

00:06:04.046 --> 00:06:05.447
just like we do.

00:06:05.471 --> 00:06:06.914
When we have to make a choice,

00:06:06.938 --> 00:06:10.335
often between having a little extra money
and saving a human life,

00:06:11.105 --> 00:06:14.419
we often feel that we have a duty
to spend the money

00:06:14.443 --> 00:06:15.737
and save the life.

00:06:15.761 --> 00:06:18.747
And why should pharmaceutical
companies be any different?

00:06:19.663 --> 00:06:24.173
But really, it isn't realistic
to expect pharmaceutical companies

00:06:24.197 --> 00:06:27.644
to act as well as you
or maybe I might act.

00:06:28.342 --> 00:06:29.980
And the reason is threefold.

00:06:30.605 --> 00:06:34.774
One is that pharmaceutical companies
are bound to their shareholders.

00:06:35.441 --> 00:06:38.669
The executive of such a company
wouldn't last very long

00:06:38.693 --> 00:06:42.957
if he gave a lot of money away,
or she, for good purposes,

00:06:42.981 --> 00:06:46.893
and thereby lost money
for the shareholders.

00:06:46.917 --> 00:06:48.225
They would be replaced.

00:06:48.905 --> 00:06:52.718
Also, pharmaceutical companies stand
in fierce competition with one another,

00:06:52.742 --> 00:06:56.107
and if you do more, if you are nicer
than the other company,

00:06:56.131 --> 00:06:58.675
sooner or later, you'll be
driven out of the market.

00:06:58.699 --> 00:06:59.858
You will not survive.

00:06:59.882 --> 00:07:02.095
The other company will gain market share.

00:07:03.294 --> 00:07:04.821
And finally, remember --

00:07:04.845 --> 00:07:07.897
the entire industry
is dependent for its income

00:07:07.921 --> 00:07:10.191
on one thing and one thing only: markups.

00:07:10.968 --> 00:07:14.753
And ultimately, you have
to be sustainable.

00:07:14.777 --> 00:07:17.112
If you spend a lot of money
on helping poor people

00:07:17.136 --> 00:07:19.750
and you don't get paid for it,
and you lose this money;

00:07:19.774 --> 00:07:23.885
you cannot continue
with your innovative activities.

00:07:24.456 --> 00:07:26.713
So for these reasons,
it's just unrealistic

00:07:26.737 --> 00:07:30.228
to expect that pharmaceutical companies
will solve the problem

00:07:30.252 --> 00:07:31.884
on moral grounds.

00:07:31.908 --> 00:07:33.689
Who, then, should solve the problem?

00:07:33.713 --> 00:07:35.158
I suggest it has to be us.

00:07:35.662 --> 00:07:39.417
We, citizens and politicians,
have to do better

00:07:39.441 --> 00:07:42.564
in terms of regulating
the pharmaceutical industry,

00:07:42.588 --> 00:07:45.220
focusing them,
giving them the right incentives,

00:07:45.244 --> 00:07:47.986
focusing them on the problems
that really matter.

00:07:49.452 --> 00:07:52.478
The potential gains here are enormous.

00:07:52.502 --> 00:07:57.058
About one third of all deaths
each day, each year,

00:07:57.082 --> 00:08:00.494
are due to the diseases of poverty
in the developing world.

00:08:00.518 --> 00:08:06.542
Fifty thousand people every day
die prematurely from these diseases.

00:08:07.122 --> 00:08:09.691
And that's not even counting
all the diseases

00:08:09.715 --> 00:08:12.237
that we know only too well
in the rich countries:

00:08:12.261 --> 00:08:14.179
cancer, heart disease and so on.

00:08:14.203 --> 00:08:16.826
Again, poor people die often much earlier,

00:08:16.850 --> 00:08:20.650
because they don't have good medical care,
including good medicines.

00:08:21.672 --> 00:08:26.074
And even in rich countries, many patients
are not getting the best medicine.

00:08:26.098 --> 00:08:29.576
That's sometimes due to the fact
that insurance companies won't cover it,

00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:32.296
because the price
is so absolutely ridiculous.

00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:33.892
And it's also due, sometimes,

00:08:33.916 --> 00:08:37.575
to the fact that doctors
and patients are falsely influenced

00:08:37.599 --> 00:08:40.835
by advertising campaigns
of pharmaceutical companies.

00:08:42.169 --> 00:08:44.976
So what can we do?
How can we change the system?

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:48.617
I want to show you a way
in which we can better incentivize

00:08:48.641 --> 00:08:52.113
pharmaceutical innovation and
the provision [of] medicines

00:08:52.137 --> 00:08:54.103
to poor people and rich alike.

00:08:54.764 --> 00:08:56.647
And that is the Health Impact Fund.

00:08:56.671 --> 00:09:00.633
The Health Impact Fund is basically
opening up the second track

00:09:00.657 --> 00:09:05.057
with which pharmaceutical innovators
can be rewarded for their activities.

00:09:05.081 --> 00:09:06.247
They have a choice.

00:09:06.271 --> 00:09:10.942
They can either go with the old system,
with patent-protected markups,

00:09:10.966 --> 00:09:13.355
or they can go with the new system,

00:09:13.379 --> 00:09:16.077
being rewarded on the basis
of the health impact

00:09:16.101 --> 00:09:18.203
of the medicines that they develop.

00:09:18.823 --> 00:09:21.691
And with each particular medicine,
they have their choice.

00:09:21.715 --> 00:09:24.762
So they can be partly on one track,
partly on the other,

00:09:24.786 --> 00:09:26.248
with different products.

00:09:26.272 --> 00:09:28.965
Now, how would
the Health Impact Fund work?

00:09:30.045 --> 00:09:32.273
There would be a fixed
reward pool every year.

00:09:32.297 --> 00:09:34.297
We start with maybe six billion dollars,

00:09:34.321 --> 00:09:36.116
but that can eventually be revved up.

00:09:36.140 --> 00:09:39.783
Remember that the total money
that the world spends on pharmaceuticals

00:09:39.807 --> 00:09:40.965
is a trillion.

00:09:40.989 --> 00:09:44.039
So it's a thousand billion;
six billion is a drop in the bucket.

00:09:44.063 --> 00:09:46.804
It's relatively small,
but it would work with six billion,

00:09:46.828 --> 00:09:50.592
and we'd get a lot of bang for the buck
if we introduced the Health Impact Fund

00:09:50.616 --> 00:09:52.254
with just six billion dollars.

00:09:52.906 --> 00:09:56.442
If you have a product
and you want to register it

00:09:56.466 --> 00:09:58.178
with the Health Impact Fund,

00:09:58.202 --> 00:10:01.593
you will be rewarded
for a period of 10 years.

00:10:01.617 --> 00:10:07.373
During these 10 years, you get a share
of these annual reward pools.

00:10:07.397 --> 00:10:12.807
That share would be proportional to
your share of the health impact achieved

00:10:12.831 --> 00:10:14.700
by all these registered products.

00:10:15.162 --> 00:10:19.807
So if your product accounts
for eight percent of the health impact

00:10:19.831 --> 00:10:21.926
of all the registered products,

00:10:21.950 --> 00:10:25.634
you get eight percent
of the reward money that year.

00:10:25.658 --> 00:10:27.535
That repeats for 10 years,

00:10:27.559 --> 00:10:30.887
and at the end of the 10 years,
your product goes generic,

00:10:30.911 --> 00:10:34.225
so you basically lose
any further income from it.

00:10:36.081 --> 00:10:40.150
Each year, the health impact
from your product would be evaluated,

00:10:40.174 --> 00:10:42.773
and you would be paid on that basis.

00:10:43.496 --> 00:10:46.949
Now, if you take that reward
from the Health Impact Fund,

00:10:46.973 --> 00:10:49.927
you can't claim the other reward,
you can't mark up the price.

00:10:49.951 --> 00:10:51.437
You have to sell at cost.

00:10:51.461 --> 00:10:53.052
What does that mean?

00:10:53.703 --> 00:10:56.613
Well, it doesn't mean
that the pharmaceutical company tells us

00:10:56.637 --> 00:10:57.801
what their cost is;

00:10:57.825 --> 00:11:02.022
but rather, our preferred way
of determining what the real cost is

00:11:02.046 --> 00:11:04.803
of making a medicine, of manufacturing it,

00:11:04.827 --> 00:11:08.460
is to ask the registrant to put
the production of the medicine

00:11:08.484 --> 00:11:13.678
out for tender, let generic companies
compete for the production,

00:11:13.702 --> 00:11:17.646
and then the innovator would buy
the product from the cheapest supplier

00:11:17.670 --> 00:11:23.047
and would sell it at that same
lowest possible price to patients.

00:11:23.762 --> 00:11:28.750
So the innovator would make no money
at all on selling the product,

00:11:28.774 --> 00:11:33.115
but would make all its money
from the health impact rewards.

00:11:34.129 --> 00:11:38.547
Now, how do we assess the impact
of the introduction of a medicine?

00:11:39.289 --> 00:11:43.048
Well, we assess it relative
to the preceding state of the art.

00:11:43.072 --> 00:11:45.740
So some people,
before the medicine came along,

00:11:45.764 --> 00:11:47.102
had no treatment at all.

00:11:47.126 --> 00:11:50.155
Now for the first time, they have
treatment, because it's cheap;

00:11:50.179 --> 00:11:51.399
people can afford it.

00:11:51.423 --> 00:11:54.820
So here, the impact is the difference
between being treated

00:11:54.844 --> 00:11:56.171
and not being treated.

00:11:56.766 --> 00:12:00.436
In other cases, the new product
is better than the old products,

00:12:00.460 --> 00:12:03.588
and so a person gets switched over
to a better product,

00:12:03.612 --> 00:12:07.939
and we pay for the impact,
for the difference the new product makes.

00:12:08.748 --> 00:12:11.036
If you have a product
on the Health Impact Fund

00:12:11.060 --> 00:12:13.750
and you simply switch somebody
from an existing product

00:12:13.774 --> 00:12:16.620
to another product, to your product,
and it's no better,

00:12:16.644 --> 00:12:17.800
you get no money.

00:12:17.824 --> 00:12:20.756
That's in stark contrast
to the existing system,

00:12:20.780 --> 00:12:24.141
where you get a lot of money
for switching somebody from one product

00:12:24.165 --> 00:12:26.927
to an equal product that is your product.

00:12:27.400 --> 00:12:30.086
The Health Impact Fund
does not pay for that.

00:12:31.435 --> 00:12:35.071
We quantify health impact in terms
of quality-adjusted life years.

00:12:35.095 --> 00:12:37.554
That method has been around
for about 20 years,

00:12:37.578 --> 00:12:39.106
and it's very easy to explain.

00:12:39.130 --> 00:12:41.751
Just think of a human life
as a kind of plank.

00:12:41.775 --> 00:12:44.506
It's eighty inches long, one inch high.

00:12:44.530 --> 00:12:47.002
And when you die prematurely
before you reach 80,

00:12:47.026 --> 00:12:48.962
well, the plank is a little shorter.

00:12:48.986 --> 00:12:52.088
And if you're sick during
the time that you live,

00:12:52.112 --> 00:12:53.922
the plank is a little bit thinner.

00:12:54.688 --> 00:12:58.388
And what diseases can nibble away,
medicines can restore,

00:12:58.412 --> 00:13:02.663
or medicines can avert
the taking away of these parts.

00:13:03.203 --> 00:13:05.517
And they get paid for that.

00:13:05.541 --> 00:13:07.213
That's the method, basically.

00:13:08.808 --> 00:13:12.311
Now, we look – of course,
each year, we have to assess.

00:13:12.335 --> 00:13:14.540
We have to spend
a considerable amount of money

00:13:14.564 --> 00:13:16.382
looking at how these various medicines

00:13:16.406 --> 00:13:18.609
that are registered
with the Health Impact Fund

00:13:18.633 --> 00:13:20.147
are doing in various countries.

00:13:20.171 --> 00:13:22.216
And here, statistics is extremely helpful.

00:13:22.240 --> 00:13:25.946
You all know how exit polling works.
This is a similar method.

00:13:25.970 --> 00:13:29.505
You look for a statistically
significant sample,

00:13:29.529 --> 00:13:33.494
and then try to figure out
what the health impact of the medicine is

00:13:33.518 --> 00:13:36.561
in different locations,
in different demographic groups ...

00:13:36.585 --> 00:13:39.609
And, of course, you look very carefully
at the actual world --

00:13:39.633 --> 00:13:44.203
this is in contrast to how medicines
are today rewarded.

00:13:44.227 --> 00:13:46.903
Sometimes, there is a reward
based on performance,

00:13:46.927 --> 00:13:51.461
but it's the performance in clinical
trials, in the laboratory, if you like,

00:13:51.485 --> 00:13:54.477
and not the performance in the real world.

00:13:54.501 --> 00:13:58.514
The Health Impact Fund
would look at real-world impact.

00:13:58.538 --> 00:14:01.720
It would look not just
at the quality of a drug,

00:14:01.744 --> 00:14:05.315
but also at how widely it is distributed,

00:14:05.339 --> 00:14:08.690
whether the innovator manages
to target those patients

00:14:08.714 --> 00:14:10.974
who can benefit the most,

00:14:10.998 --> 00:14:14.610
and also, how well the drug
is used in the field.

00:14:14.634 --> 00:14:18.787
So innovators would have much
stronger incentives than they do now

00:14:18.811 --> 00:14:21.278
to make sure that every patient
who takes the drug

00:14:21.302 --> 00:14:24.293
knows exactly how to take it
to optimal effect.

00:14:24.317 --> 00:14:29.021
Today, most packaged inserts are not even
translated into local languages,

00:14:29.045 --> 00:14:33.936
and so it's not surprising that patients
don't make the best use of the product.

00:14:35.555 --> 00:14:37.563
Now, how would the financing work?

00:14:38.369 --> 00:14:41.333
Basically, the Health Impact Fund,
as I said, could start

00:14:41.357 --> 00:14:43.316
with something like six billion dollars.

00:14:43.340 --> 00:14:45.733
It's not nothing, but it's also
not a lot of money,

00:14:45.757 --> 00:14:48.868
compared to what the world is already
spending on pharmaceuticals.

00:14:48.892 --> 00:14:51.714
So the best way to think of it
is as a new way of paying

00:14:51.738 --> 00:14:54.897
for what we are already paying for,
namely, new medicines.

00:14:54.921 --> 00:14:57.667
You pay with one hand
through the tax system,

00:14:57.691 --> 00:15:00.292
but you get something back
with the other hand,

00:15:00.316 --> 00:15:02.741
because you also get
these medicines for cheap.

00:15:02.765 --> 00:15:04.485
This is not just for poor people --

00:15:04.509 --> 00:15:09.596
everybody will have these Health Impact
Fund registered medicines at cost,

00:15:09.620 --> 00:15:11.499
at a very low price.

00:15:12.649 --> 00:15:17.699
One very important hurdle here,
politically, is that we have to make sure

00:15:17.723 --> 00:15:20.998
that we have long-term
visibility for innovators,

00:15:21.022 --> 00:15:23.734
that innovators know
that the money is actually there,

00:15:23.758 --> 00:15:27.919
and so we need governments
to fund the Health Impact Fund,

00:15:27.943 --> 00:15:30.973
because only governments can make
predictable commitments

00:15:30.997 --> 00:15:33.067
for a long period of time.

00:15:33.699 --> 00:15:38.493
Because the Health Impact Fund
registration is voluntary,

00:15:38.517 --> 00:15:42.056
you basically have
a self-adjusting reward rate.

00:15:42.080 --> 00:15:45.217
As the rate rises too high,

00:15:46.129 --> 00:15:48.951
innovators will come in
and drive the rate down.

00:15:48.975 --> 00:15:51.494
Conversely, if the rate falls too low,

00:15:51.518 --> 00:15:55.258
innovators would be reluctant
to register, and the rate will recover.

00:15:55.282 --> 00:15:58.660
So the rate will always be
at a reasonable level.

00:15:59.819 --> 00:16:03.163
The Health Impact Fund
is beneficial for all parties.

00:16:03.187 --> 00:16:07.019
It benefits innovators
by giving them a new market,

00:16:07.043 --> 00:16:11.098
and most importantly, by overcoming
their public relations problems

00:16:11.122 --> 00:16:12.438
that we started with.

00:16:13.198 --> 00:16:14.749
It benefits patients,

00:16:14.773 --> 00:16:18.145
because patients are much more likely
to get the right medicine,

00:16:18.169 --> 00:16:21.131
and also for these
medicines to be developed,

00:16:21.155 --> 00:16:22.954
the medicines that we most need.

00:16:23.658 --> 00:16:27.067
And it also benefits governments
or taxpayers, if you like,

00:16:27.091 --> 00:16:30.556
because it creates a permanent source
of pharmaceutical innovation

00:16:30.580 --> 00:16:32.920
that will be here for all future times.

00:16:32.944 --> 00:16:36.502
It's a kind of machine that always
directs pharmaceutical innovation

00:16:36.526 --> 00:16:38.650
to where we have the greatest problems,

00:16:38.674 --> 00:16:41.365
maybe for diseases
that don't even exist yet.

00:16:41.389 --> 00:16:44.501
The Health Impact Fund
will always channel innovation

00:16:44.525 --> 00:16:46.667
in the direction where it's most needed.

00:16:47.321 --> 00:16:49.563
Now, we have a little bit of help already.

00:16:49.587 --> 00:16:53.371
You can see here the number of people
who have agreed to help us,

00:16:53.395 --> 00:16:55.605
but we want your help as well.

00:16:55.629 --> 00:17:00.075
We want you to join us,
maybe to talk with your government

00:17:00.099 --> 00:17:01.775
to help us with publicity,

00:17:01.799 --> 00:17:06.278
to help us with your ideas in perfecting
the Health Impact Fund scheme.

00:17:06.787 --> 00:17:09.491
And what we most urgently need
for the moment

00:17:09.515 --> 00:17:11.565
is to start a pilot.

00:17:12.060 --> 00:17:16.194
The pilot would introduce one medicine
into one jurisdiction

00:17:16.218 --> 00:17:18.765
on the Health Impact Fund model.

00:17:18.789 --> 00:17:23.994
The innovator would get paid according
to the cost of the medicine for the sales,

00:17:24.018 --> 00:17:28.064
and would then get additional money
on the basis of the health impact.

00:17:29.286 --> 00:17:34.748
Here, we need funding for the rewards,
funding for the assessment,

00:17:34.772 --> 00:17:37.365
and in particular, we need
political support

00:17:37.389 --> 00:17:43.375
to get politicians to support
a pilot of that sort.

00:17:43.906 --> 00:17:48.070
If you have any further questions,
don't hesitate to write us

00:17:48.094 --> 00:17:49.897
and contact us at this address.

00:17:49.921 --> 00:17:51.080
Thank you very much.

00:17:51.104 --> 00:17:54.377
(Applause)
