00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
I'm here to talk about

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
the wonder and the mystery

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
of conscious minds.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
The wonder is about the fact

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
that we all woke up this morning

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
and we had with it

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
the amazing return of our conscious mind.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
We recovered minds with a complete sense of self

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
and a complete sense of our own existence,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
yet we hardly ever pause to consider this wonder.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
We should, in fact,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
because without having this possibility of conscious minds,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
we would have no knowledge whatsoever

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
about our humanity;

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
we would have no knowledge whatsoever about the world.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
We would have no pains, but also no joys.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
We would have no access to love

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
or to the ability to create.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
And of course, Scott Fitzgerald said famously

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
that "he who invented consciousness

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
would have a lot to be blamed for."

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
But he also forgot

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
that without consciousness,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
he would have no access to true happiness

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
and even the possibility of transcendence.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
So much for the wonder, now for the mystery.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
This is a mystery

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
that has really been extremely hard to elucidate.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
All the way back into early philosophy

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
and certainly throughout the history of neuroscience,

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
this has been one mystery

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
that has always resisted elucidation,

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
has got major controversies.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
And there are actually many people

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
that think we should not even touch it;

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
we should just leave it alone, it's not to be solved.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
I don't believe that,

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
and I think the situation is changing.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
It would be ridiculous to claim

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
that we know how we make consciousness

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
in our brains,

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
but we certainly can begin

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
to approach the question,

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
and we can begin to see the shape of a solution.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000
And one more wonder to celebrate

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000
is the fact that we have imaging technologies

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000
that now allow us to go inside the human brain

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
and be able to do, for example,

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
what you're seeing right now.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
These are images that come from Hanna Damasio's lab,

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
and which show you, in a living brain,

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
the reconstruction of that brain.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
And this is a person who is alive.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
This is not a person

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000
that is being studied at autopsy.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
And even more --

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
and this is something that one can be really amazed about --

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
is what I'm going to show you next,

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
which is going underneath the surface of the brain

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
and actually looking in the living brain

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000
at real connections, real pathways.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000
So all of those colored lines

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000
correspond to bunches of axons,

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
the fibers that join cell bodies

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000
to synapses.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
And I'm sorry to disappoint you, they don't come in color.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
But at any rate, they are there.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
The colors are codes for the direction,

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
from whether it is back to front

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
or vice versa.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
At any rate, what is consciousness?

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
What is a conscious mind?

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
And we could take a very simple view

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.000
and say, well, it is that which we lose

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:13.000
when we fall into deep sleep without dreams,

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
or when we go under anesthesia,

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
and it is what we regain

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
when we recover from sleep

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
or from anesthesia.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.000
But what is exactly that stuff that we lose under anesthesia,

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
or when we are in deep, dreamless sleep?

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000
Well first of all,

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
it is a mind,

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000
which is a flow of mental images.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000
And of course consider images

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000
that can be sensory patterns,

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000
visual, such as you're having right now

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000
in relation to the stage and me,

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000
or auditory images,

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000
as you are having now in relation to my words.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000
That flow of mental images

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000
is mind.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000
But there is something else

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000
that we are all experiencing in this room.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000
We are not passive exhibitors

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.000
of visual or auditory

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000
or tactile images.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
We have selves.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000
We have a Me

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000
that is automatically present

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000
in our minds right now.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000
We own our minds.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.000
And we have a sense that it's everyone of us

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000
that is experiencing this --

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000
not the person who is sitting next to you.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.000
So in order to have a conscious mind,

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:25.000
you have a self within the conscious mind.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.000
So a conscious mind is a mind with a self in it.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000
The self introduces the subjective perspective in the mind,

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000
and we are only fully conscious

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000
when self comes to mind.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.000
So what we need to know to even address this mystery

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.000
is, number one, how are minds are put together in the brain,

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:45.000
and, number two, how selves are constructed.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000
Now the first part, the first problem,

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.000
is relatively easy -- it's not easy at all --

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:55.000
but it is something that has been approached gradually in neuroscience.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.000
And it's quite clear that, in order to make minds,

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.000
we need to construct neural maps.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.000
So imagine a grid, like the one I'm showing you right now,

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000
and now imagine, within that grid,

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000
that two-dimensional sheet,

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000
imagine neurons.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000
And picture, if you will,

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000
a billboard, a digital billboard,

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000
where you have elements

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000
that can be either lit or not.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.000
And depending on how you create the pattern

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.000
of lighting or not lighting,

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000
the digital elements,

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000
or, for that matter, the neurons in the sheet,

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000
you're going to be able to construct a map.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000
This, of course, is a visual map that I'm showing you,

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.000
but this applies to any kind of map --

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.000
auditory, for example, in relation to sound frequencies,

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.000
or to the maps that we construct with our skin

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.000
in relation to an object that we palpate.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000
Now to bring home the point

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.000
of how close it is --

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.000
the relationship between the grid of neurons

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000
and the topographical arrangement

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.000
of the activity of the neurons

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000
and our mental experience --

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.000
I'm going to tell you a personal story.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.000
So if I cover my left eye --

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.000
I'm talking about me personally, not all of you --

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.000
if I cover my left eye,

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.000
I look at the grid -- pretty much like the one I'm showing you.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.000
Everything is nice and fine and perpendicular.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000
But sometime ago, I discovered

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.000
that if I cover my left eye,

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.000
instead what I get is this.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.000
I look at the grid and I see a warping

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.000
at the edge of my central-left field.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000
Very odd -- I've analyzed this for a while.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.000
But sometime ago,

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.000
through the help of an opthamologist colleague of mine,

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.000
Carmen Puliafito,

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.000
who developed a laser scanner of the retina,

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.000
I found out the the following.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000
If I scan my retina

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.000
through the horizontal plane that you see there in the little corner,

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000
what I get is the following.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.000
On the right side, my retina is perfectly symmetrical.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.000
You see the going down towards the fovea

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000
where the optic nerve begins.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.000
But on my left retina there is a bump,

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.000
which is marked there by the red arrow.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000
And it corresponds to a little cyst

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.000
that is located below.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.000
And that is exactly what causes

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.000
the warping of my visual image.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000
So just think of this:

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.000
you have a grid of neurons,

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:17.000
and now you have a plane mechanical change

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.000
in the position of the grid,

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.000
and you get a warping of your mental experience.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.000
So this is how close

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.000
your mental experience

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:28.000
and the activity of the neurons in the retina,

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:31.000
which is a part of the brain located in the eyeball,

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:34.000
or, for that matter, a sheet of visual cortex.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000
So from the retina

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.000
you go onto visual cortex.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.000
And of course, the brain adds on

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.000
a lot of information

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.000
to what is going on

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.000
in the signals that come from the retina.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.000
And in that image there,

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.000
you see a variety of islands

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:53.000
of what I call image-making regions in the brain.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.000
You have the green for example,

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.000
that corresponds to tactile information,

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:00.000
or the blue that corresponds to auditory information.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000
And something else that happens

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:05.000
is that those image-making regions

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.000
where you have the plotting

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.000
of all these neural maps,

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.000
can then provide signals

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:14.000
to this ocean of purple that you see around,

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.000
which is the association cortex,

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:19.000
where you can make records of what went on

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.000
in those islands of image-making.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.000
And the great beauty

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:26.000
is that you can then go from memory,

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000
out of those association cortices,

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.000
and produce back images

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:34.000
in the very same regions that have perception.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:37.000
So think about how wonderfully convenient and lazy

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.000
the brain is.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.000
So it provides certain areas

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.000
for perception and image-making.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.000
And those are exactly the same

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:48.000
that are going to be used for image-making

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.000
when we recall information.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:54.000
So far the mystery of the conscious mind

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.000
is diminishing a little bit

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.000
because we have a general sense

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.000
of how we make these images.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000
But what about the self?

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:05.000
The self is really the elusive problem.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.000
And for a long time,

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.000
people did not even want to touch it,

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.000
because they'd say,

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:14.000
"How can you have this reference point, this stability,

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.000
that is required to maintain

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:19.000
the continuity of selves day after day?"

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:22.000
And I thought about a solution to this problem.

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.000
It's the following.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.000
We generate brain maps

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.000
of the body's interior

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:31.000
and use them as the reference for all other maps.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:34.000
So let me tell you just a little bit about how I came to this.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.000
I came to this because,

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:40.000
if you're going to have a reference that we know as self --

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.000
the Me, the I

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.000
in our own processing --

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.000
we need to have something that is stable,

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:50.000
something that does not deviate much

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.000
from day to day.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.000
Well it so happens that we have a singular body.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:57.000
We have one body, not two, not three.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.000
And so that is a beginning.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.000
There is just one reference point, which is the body.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:04.000
But then, of course, the body has many parts,

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.000
and things grow at different rates,

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.000
and they have different sizes and different people;

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:11.000
however, not so with the interior.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.000
The things that have to do

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.000
with what is known as our internal milieu --

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:17.000
for example, the whole management

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.000
of the chemistries within our body

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.000
are, in fact, extremely maintained

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.000
day after day

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.000
for one very good reason.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.000
If you deviate too much

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.000
in the parameters

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.000
that are close to the midline

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:34.000
of that life-permitting survival range,

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.000
you go into disease or death.

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:39.000
So we have an in-built system

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.000
within our own lives

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:44.000
that ensures some kind of continuity.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:47.000
I like to call it an almost infinite sameness from day to day.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:51.000
Because if you don't have that sameness, physiologically,

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:53.000
you're going to be sick or you're going to die.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:56.000
So that's one more element for this continuity.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.000
And the final thing

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.000
is that there is a very tight coupling

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:04.000
between the regulation of our body within the brain

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:06.000
and the body itself,

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:09.000
unlike any other coupling.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.000
So for example, I'm making images of you,

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:14.000
but there's no physiological bond

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:17.000
between the images I have of you as an audience

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.000
and my brain.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:23.000
However, there is a close, permanently maintained bond

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:26.000
between the body regulating parts of my brain

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.000
and my own body.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:31.000
So here's how it looks. Look at the region there.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:34.000
There is the brain stem in between the cerebral cortex

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.000
and the spinal cord.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.000
And it is within that region

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.000
that I'm going to highlight now

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:43.000
that we have this housing

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:46.000
of all the life-regulation devices

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.000
of the body.

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:51.000
This is so specific that, for example,

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:54.000
if you look at the part that is covered in red

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.000
in the upper part of the brain stem,

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:59.000
if you damage that as a result of a stroke, for example,

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.000
what you get is coma

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.000
or vegetative state,

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:05.000
which is a state, of course,

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:07.000
in which your mind disappears,

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:10.000
your consciousness disappears.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.000
What happens then actually

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:15.000
is that you lose the grounding of the self,

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:18.000
you have no longer access to any feeling of your own existence,

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:21.000
and, in fact, there can be images going on,

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:23.000
being formed in the cerebral cortex,

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:25.000
except you don't know they're there.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:28.000
You have, in effect, lost consciousness

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:32.000
when you have damage to that red section of the brain stem.

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:35.000
But if you consider the green part of the brain stem,

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:37.000
nothing like that happens.

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.000
It is that specific.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:42.000
So in that green component of the brain stem,

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:45.000
if you damage it, and often it happens,

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:47.000
what you get is complete paralysis,

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:50.000
but your conscious mind is maintained.

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:53.000
You feel, you know, you have a fully conscious mind

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:56.000
that you can report very indirectly.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:59.000
This is a horrific condition. You don't want to see it.

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.000
And people are, in fact, imprisoned

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:03.000
within their own bodies,

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:05.000
but they do have a mind.

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:07.000
There was a very interesting film,

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:09.000
one of the rare good films done

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:11.000
about a situation like this,

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:13.000
by Julian Schnabel some years ago

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:16.000
about a patient that was in that condition.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.000
So now I'm going to show you a picture.

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:20.000
I promise not to say anything about this,

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.000
except this is to frighten you.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.000
It's just to tell you

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:27.000
that in that red section of the brain stem,

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:29.000
there are, to make it simple,

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:32.000
all those little squares that correspond to modules

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:35.000
that actually make brain maps

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:38.000
of different aspects of our interior,

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.000
different aspects of our body.

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:43.000
They are exquisitely topographic

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:45.000
and they are exquisitely interconnected

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.000
in a recursive pattern.

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:50.000
And it is out of this and out of this tight coupling

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.000
between the brain stem and the body

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:54.000
that I believe -- and I could be wrong,

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.000
but I don't think I am --

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:59.000
that you generate this mapping of the body

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:02.000
that provides the grounding for the self

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.000
and that comes in the form of feelings --

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:06.000
primordial feelings, by the way.

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:08.000
So what is the picture that we get here?

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:10.000
Look at "cerebral cortex," look at "brain stem,"

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:12.000
look at "body,"

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:15.000
and you get the picture of the interconnectivity

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:19.000
in which you have the brain stem providing the grounding for the self

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:22.000
in a very tight interconnection with the body.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:24.000
And you have the cerebral cortex

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:27.000
providing the great spectacle of our minds

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:29.000
with the profusion of images

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:32.000
that are, in fact, the contents of our minds

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:35.000
and that we normally pay most attention to,

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:37.000
as we should, because that's really

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.000
the film that is rolling in our minds.

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:41.000
But look at the arrows.

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:43.000
They're not there for looks.

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:46.000
They're there because there's this very close interaction.

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.000
You cannot have a conscious mind

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:50.000
if you don't have the interaction

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:52.000
between cerebral cortex and brain stem.

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:54.000
You cannot have a conscious mind

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:56.000
if you don't have the interaction

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:58.000
between the brain stem and the body.

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:00.000
Another thing that is interesting

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.000
is that the brain stem that we have

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:04.000
is shared with a variety of other species.

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:06.000
So throughout vertebrates,

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:09.000
the design of the brain stem is very similar to ours,

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:11.000
which is one of the reasons why I think

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:14.000
those other species have conscious minds like we do.

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:17.000
Except that they're not as rich as ours,

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:19.000
because they don't have a cerebral cortex like we do.

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:21.000
That's where the difference is.

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:24.000
And I strongly disagree with the idea

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:27.000
that consciousness should be considered

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:29.000
as the great product of the cerebral cortex.

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:31.000
Only the wealth of our minds is,

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:34.000
not the very fact that we have a self

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:36.000
that we can refer

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:38.000
to our own existence,

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:42.000
and that we have any sense of person.

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:45.000
Now there are three levels of self to consider --

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:48.000
the proto, the core and the autobiographical.

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:50.000
The first two are shared

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:52.000
with many, many other species,

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:54.000
and they are really coming out

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:56.000
largely of the brain stem

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:59.000
and whatever there is of cortex in those species.

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:01.000
It's the autobiographical self

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:03.000
which some species have, I think.

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:06.000
Cetaceans and primates have also

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:08.000
an autobiographical self to a certain degree.

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:10.000
And everybody's dogs at home

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:13.000
have an autobiographical self to a certain degree.

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:15.000
But the novelty is here.

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:17.000
The autobiographical self is built

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:19.000
on the basis of past memories

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:22.000
and memories of the plans that we have made;

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:25.000
it's the lived past and the anticipated future.

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:27.000
And the autobiographical self

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:30.000
has prompted extended memory, reasoning,

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:32.000
imagination, creativity and language.

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:35.000
And out of that came the instruments of culture --

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:37.000
religions, justice,

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:39.000
trade, the arts, science, technology.

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:41.000
And it is within that culture

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:43.000
that we really can get --

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:45.000
and this is the novelty --

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:49.000
something that is not entirely set by our biology.

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:51.000
It is developed in the cultures.

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:55.000
It developed in collectives of human beings.

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:57.000
And this is, of course, the culture

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:00.000
where we have developed something that I like to call

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:02.000
socio-cultural regulation.

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:04.000
And finally, you could rightly ask,

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:06.000
why care about this?

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:09.000
Why care if it is the brain stem or the cerebral cortex

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:11.000
and how this is made?

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:13.000
Three reasons. First, curiosity.

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:15.000
Primates are extremely curious --

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:17.000
and humans most of all.

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:20.000
And if we are interested, for example,

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:22.000
in the fact that anti-gravity

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:24.000
is pulling galaxies away from the Earth,

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:26.000
why should we not be interested in what is going on

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:29.000
inside of human beings?

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:31.000
Second, understanding society and culture.

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:33.000
We should look

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:35.000
at how society and culture

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:37.000
in this socio-cultural regulation

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:39.000
are a work in progress.

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:41.000
And finally, medicine.

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:43.000
Let's not forget that some of the worst diseases

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:45.000
of humankind

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:47.000
are diseases such as depression,

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:50.000
Alzheimer's disease, drug addiction.

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:53.000
Think of strokes that can devastate your mind

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:55.000
or render you unconscious.

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:58.000
You have no prayer

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:01.000
of treating those diseases effectively

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:03.000
and in a non-serendipitous way

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:05.000
if you do not know how this works.

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:07.000
So that's a very good reason

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:09.000
beyond curiosity

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:11.000
to justify what we're doing,

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:14.000
and to justify having some interest in what is going on in our brains.

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:16.000
Thank you for your attention.

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:21.000
