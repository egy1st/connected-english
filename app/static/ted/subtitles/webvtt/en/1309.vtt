00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
I study how the brain processes

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
information. That is, how it takes

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
information in from the outside world, and

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
converts it into patterns of electrical activity,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
and then how it uses those patterns

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
to allow you to do things --

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
to see, hear, to reach for an object.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
So I'm really a basic scientist, not

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
a clinician, but in the last year and a half

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
I've started to switch over, to use what

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
we've been learning about these patterns

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
of activity to develop prosthetic devices,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
and what I wanted to do today is show you

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
an example of this.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
It's really our first foray into this.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
It's the development of a prosthetic device

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
for treating blindness.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
So let me start in on that problem.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
There are 10 million people in the U.S.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
and many more worldwide who are blind

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
or are facing blindness due to diseases

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
of the retina, diseases like

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
macular degeneration, and there's little

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
that can be done for them.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
There are some drug treatments, but

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
they're only effective on a small fraction

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
of the population. And so, for the vast

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
majority of patients, their best hope for

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
regaining sight is through prosthetic devices.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
The problem is that current prosthetics

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
don't work very well. They're still very

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
limited in the vision that they can provide.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
And so, you know, for example, with these

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
devices, patients can see simple things

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
like bright lights and high contrast edges,

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
not very much more, so nothing close

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
to normal vision has been possible.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
So what I'm going to tell you about today

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
is a device that we've been working on

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
that I think has the potential to make

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
a difference, to be much more effective,

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
and what I wanted to do is show you

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
how it works. Okay, so let me back up a

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
little bit and show you how a normal retina

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
works first so you can see the problem

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
that we were trying to solve.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
Here you have a retina.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
So you have an image, a retina, and a brain.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
So when you look at something, like this image

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
of this baby's face, it goes into your eye

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
and it lands on your retina, on the front-end

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
cells here, the photoreceptors.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
Then what happens is the retinal circuitry,

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
the middle part, goes to work on it,

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
and what it does is it performs operations

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
on it, it extracts information from it, and it

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
converts that information into a code.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
And the code is in the form of these patterns

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
of electrical pulses that get sent

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
up to the brain, and so the key thing is

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
that the image ultimately gets converted

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
into a code. And when I say code,

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
I do literally mean code.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000
Like this pattern of pulses here actually means "baby's face,"

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
and so when the brain gets this pattern

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
of pulses, it knows that what was out there

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
was a baby's face, and if it

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
got a different pattern it would know

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
that what was out there was, say, a dog,

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
or another pattern would be a house.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
Anyway, you get the idea.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
And, of course, in real life, it's all dynamic,

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
meaning that it's changing all the time,

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
so the patterns of pulses are changing

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
all the time because the world you're

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
looking at is changing all the time too.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
So, you know, it's sort of a complicated

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000
thing. You have these patterns of pulses

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
coming out of your eye every millisecond

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
telling your brain what it is that you're seeing.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
So what happens when a person

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
gets a retinal degenerative disease like

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
macular degeneration? What happens is

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000
is that, the front-end cells die,

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
the photoreceptors die, and over time,

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
all the cells and the circuits that are

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
connected to them, they die too.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
Until the only things that you have left

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
are these cells here, the output cells,

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
the ones that send the signals to the brain,

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
but because of all that degeneration

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
they aren't sending any signals anymore.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
They aren't getting any input, so

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000
the person's brain no longer gets

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
any visual information --

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000
that is, he or she is blind.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
So, a solution to the problem, then,

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
would be to build a device that could mimic

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000
the actions of that front-end circuitry

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000
and send signals to the retina's output cells,

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
and they can go back to doing their

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000
normal job of sending signals to the brain.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
So this is what we've been working on,

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000
and this is what our prosthetic does.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000
So it consists of two parts, what we call

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000
an encoder and a transducer.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000
And so the encoder does just

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000
what I was saying: it mimics the actions

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000
of the front-end circuitry -- so it takes images

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000
in and converts them into the retina's code.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000
And then the transducer then makes the

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000
output cells send the code on up

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000
to the brain, and the result is

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000
a retinal prosthetic that can produce

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000
normal retinal output.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000
So a completely blind retina,

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000
even one with no front-end circuitry at all,

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
no photoreceptors,

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000
can now send out normal signals,

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.000
signals that the brain can understand.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000
So no other device has been able

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000
to do this.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000
Okay, so I just want to take

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000
a sentence or two to say something about

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000
the encoder and what it's doing, because

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000
it's really the key part and it's

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000
sort of interesting and kind of cool.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000
I'm not sure "cool" is really the right word, but

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.000
you know what I mean.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000
So what it's doing is, it's replacing

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000
the retinal circuitry, really the guts of

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000
the retinal circuitry, with a set of equations,

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000
a set of equations that we can implement

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000
on a chip. So it's just math.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.000
In other words, we're not literally replacing

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000
the components of the retina.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000
It's not like we're making a little mini-device

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000
for each of the different cell types.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000
We've just abstracted what the

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000
retina's doing with a set of equations.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000
And so, in a way, the equations are serving

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
as sort of a codebook. An image comes in,

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.000
goes through the set of equations,

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000
and out comes streams of electrical pulses,

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:01.000
just like a normal retina would produce.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000
Now let me put my money

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000
where my mouth is and show you that

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000
we can actually produce normal output,

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000
and what the implications of this are.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000
Here are three sets of

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000
firing patterns. The top one is from

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000
a normal animal, the middle one is from

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000
a blind animal that's been treated with

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000
this encoder-transducer device, and the

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000
bottom one is from a blind animal treated

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000
with a standard prosthetic.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000
So the bottom one is the state-of-the-art

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000
device that's out there right now, which is

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000
basically made up of light detectors,

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000
but no encoder. So what we did was we

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.000
presented movies of everyday things --

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.000
people, babies, park benches,

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000
you know, regular things happening -- and

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000
we recorded the responses from the retinas

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000
of these three groups of animals.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000
Now just to orient you, each box is showing

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000
the firing patterns of several cells,

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000
and just as in the previous slides,

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.000
each row is a different cell,

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000
and I just made the pulses a little bit smaller

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.000
and thinner so I could show you

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000
a long stretch of data.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000
So as you can see, the firing patterns

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000
from the blind animal treated with

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000
the encoder-transducer really do very

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.000
closely match the normal firing patterns --

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.000
and it's not perfect, but it's pretty good --

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000
and the blind animal treated with

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000
the standard prosthetic,

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000
the responses really don't.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.000
And so with the standard method,

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000
the cells do fire, they just don't fire

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.000
in the normal firing patterns because

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.000
they don't have the right code.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.000
How important is this?

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.000
What's the potential impact

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:28.000
on a patient's ability to see?

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000
So I'm just going to show you one

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000
bottom-line experiment that answers this,

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000
and of course I've got a lot of other data,

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000
so if you're interested I'm happy

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.000
to show more. So the experiment

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.000
is called a reconstruction experiment.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000
So what we did is we took a moment

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.000
in time from these recordings and asked,

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000
what was the retina seeing at that moment?

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000
Can we reconstruct what the retina

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000
was seeing from the responses

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000
from the firing patterns?

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.000
So, when we did this for responses

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.000
from the standard method and from

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000
our encoder and transducer.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.000
So let me show you, and I'm going to

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.000
start with the standard method first.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.000
So you can see that it's pretty limited,

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000
and because the firing patterns aren't

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000
in the right code, they're very limited in

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.000
what they can tell you about

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000
what's out there. So you can see that

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.000
there's something there, but it's not so clear

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.000
what that something is, and this just sort of

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.000
circles back to what I was saying in the

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.000
beginning, that with the standard method,

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.000
patients can see high-contrast edges, they

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.000
can see light, but it doesn't easily go

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000
further than that. So what was

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:32.000
the image? It was a baby's face.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.000
So what about with our approach,

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000
adding the code? And you can see

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.000
that it's much better. Not only can you

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.000
tell that it's a baby's face, but you can

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.000
tell that it's this baby's face, which is a

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.000
really challenging task.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.000
So on the left is the encoder

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.000
alone, and on the right is from an actual

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.000
blind retina, so the encoder and the transducer.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000
But the key one really is the encoder alone,

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000
because we can team up the encoder with

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.000
the different transducer.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.000
This is just actually the first one that we tried.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000
I just wanted to say something about the standard method.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000
When this first came out, it was just a really

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000
exciting thing, the idea that you

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:07.000
even make a blind retina respond at all.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:10.000
But there was this limiting factor,

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000
the issue of the code, and how to make

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.000
the cells respond better,

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.000
produce normal responses,

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.000
and so this was our contribution.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.000
Now I just want to wrap up,

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.000
and as I was mentioning earlier

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.000
of course I have a lot of other data

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000
if you're interested, but I just wanted to give

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000
this sort of basic idea

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.000
of being able to communicate

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.000
with the brain in its language, and

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.000
the potential power of being able to do that.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.000
So it's different from the motor prosthetics

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.000
where you're communicating from the brain

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000
to a device. Here we have to communicate

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.000
from the outside world

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000
into the brain and be understood,

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.000
and be understood by the brain.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000
And then the last thing I wanted

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.000
to say, really, is to emphasize

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.000
that the idea generalizes.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.000
So the same strategy that we used

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.000
to find the code for the retina we can also

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.000
use to find the code for other areas,

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000
for example, the auditory system and

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000
the motor system, so for treating deafness

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.000
and for motor disorders.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.000
So just the same way that we were able to

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.000
jump over the damaged

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.000
circuitry in the retina to get to the retina's

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.000
output cells, we can jump over the

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.000
damaged circuitry in the cochlea

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.000
to get the auditory nerve,

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.000
or jump over damaged areas in the cortex,

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:23.000
in the motor cortex, to bridge the gap

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.000
produced by a stroke.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.000
I just want to end with a simple

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.000
message that understanding the code

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.000
is really, really important, and if we

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.000
can understand the code,

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.000
the language of the brain, things become

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.000
possible that didn't seem obviously

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.000
possible before. Thank you.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:44.000
(Applause)
