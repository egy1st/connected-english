00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Do you remember the story

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
of Odysseus and the Sirens

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
from high school or junior high school?

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
There was this hero, Odysseus, who's heading back home

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
after the Trojan War.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
And he's standing on the deck of his ship,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
he's talking to his first mate,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
and he's saying,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
"Tomorrow, we will sail past those rocks,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
and on those rocks sit some beautiful women

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
called Sirens.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
And these women sing an enchanting song,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
a song so alluring

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
that all sailors who hear it

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
crash into the rocks and die."

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
Now you would expect, given that,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
that they would choose an alternate route around the Sirens,

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
but instead Odysseus says,

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
"I want to hear that song.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
And so what I'm going to do

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
is I'm going to pour wax in the ears

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
of you and all the men --

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
stay with me --

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
so that you can't hear the song,

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
and then I'm going to have you tie me to the mast

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
so that I can listen

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
and we can all sail by unaffected."

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
So this is a captain

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
putting the life of every single person on the ship at risk

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
so that he can hear a song.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
And I'd like to think if this was the case,

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
they probably would have rehearsed it a few times.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
Odysseus would have said, "Okay, let's do a dry run.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
You tie me to the mast, and I'm going to beg and plead.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
And no matter what I say, you cannot untie me from the mast.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
All right, so tie me to the mast."

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
And the first mate takes a rope

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
and ties Odysseus to the mast in a nice knot.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
And Odysseus does his best job playacting

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
and says, "Untie me. Untie me.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
I want to hear that song. Untie me."

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
And the first mate wisely resists

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
and doesn't untie Odysseus.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
And then Odysseus says, "I see that you can get it.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
All right, untie me now and we'll get some dinner."

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
And the first mate hesitates.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
He's like, "Is this still the rehearsal,

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
or should I untie him?"

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
And the first mate thinks,

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
"Well, I guess at some point the rehearsal has to end."

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
So he unties Odysseus, and Odysseus flips out.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
He's like, "You idiot. You moron.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
If you do that tomorrow, I'll be dead, you'll be dead,

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
every single one of the men will be dead.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
Now just don't untie me no matter what."

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
He throws the first mate to the ground.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
This repeats itself through the night --

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
rehearsal, tying to the mast,

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
conning his way out of it,

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
beating the poor first mate up mercilessly.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
Hilarity ensues.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
Tying yourself to a mast

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
is perhaps the oldest written example

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000
of what psychologists call a commitment device.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000
A commitment device is a decision that you make

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000
with a cool head to bind yourself

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
so that you don't do something regrettable

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
when you have a hot head.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
Because there's two heads inside one person

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
when you think about it.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000
Scholars have long invoked this metaphor of two selves

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000
when it comes to questions of temptation.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000
There is first, the present self.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.000
This is like Odysseus when he's hearing the song.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
He just wants to get to the front row.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
He just thinks about the here and now and the immediate gratification.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
But then there's this other self, the future self.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000
This is Odysseus as an old man

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000
who wants nothing more than to retire in a sunny villa

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
with his wife Penelope

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000
outside of Ithaca -- the other one.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.000
So why do we need commitment devices?

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000
Well resisting temptation is hard,

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.000
as the 19th century English economist

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
Nassau William Senior said,

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
"To abstain from the enjoyment which is in our power,

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000
or to seek distant rather than immediate results,

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000
are among the most painful exertions

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000
of the human will."

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.000
If you set goals for yourself and you're like a lot of other people,

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000
you probably realize

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000
it's not that your goals are physically impossible

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000
that's keeping you from achieving them,

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.000
it's that you lack the self-discipline to stick to them.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000
It's physically possible to lose weight.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000
It's physically possible to exercise more.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000
But resisting temptation

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000
is hard.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000
The other reason

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000
that it's difficult to resist temptation

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000
is because it's an unequal battle

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000
between the present self and the future self.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000
I mean, let's face it, the present self is present.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.000
It's in control. It's in power right now.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000
It has these strong, heroic arms

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000
that can lift doughnuts into your mouth.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.000
And the future self is not even around.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.000
It's off in the future. It's weak.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.000
It doesn't even have a lawyer present.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000
There's nobody to stick up for the future self.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000
And so the present self can trounce

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
all over its dreams.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.000
So there's this battle between the two selves that's being fought,

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000
and we need commitment devices

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.000
to level the playing field between the two.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.000
Now I'm a big fan of commitment devices actually.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.000
Tying yourself to the mast is the oldest one, but there are other ones

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:51.000
such as locking a credit card away with a key

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000
or not bringing junk food into the house so you won't eat it

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000
or unplugging your Internet connection

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000
so you can use your computer.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000
I was creating commitment devices of my own

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000
long before I knew what they were.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000
So when I was a starving post-doc

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000
at Columbia University,

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000
I was deep in a publish-or-perish phase of my career.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000
I had to write five pages a day

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000
towards papers

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.000
or I would have to give up five dollars.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.000
And when you try to execute these commitment devices,

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000
you realize the devil is really in the details.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.000
Because it's not that easy to get rid of five dollars.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.000
I mean, you can't burn it; that's illegal.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000
And I thought, well I could give it to a charity

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000
or give it to my wife or something like that.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.000
But then I thought, oh, I'm sending myself mixed messages.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.000
Because not writing is bad, but giving to charity is good.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.000
So then I would kind of justify not writing

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000
by giving a gift.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000
And then I kind of flipped that around and thought,

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.000
well I could give it to the neo-Nazis.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.000
But then I was like, that's more bad than writing is good,

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.000
and so that wouldn't work.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000
So ultimately, I just decided

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.000
I would leave it in an envelope on the subway.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000
Sometimes a good person would find it,

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000
sometimes a bad person would find it.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.000
On average, it was just a completely pointless exchange of money

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.000
that I would regret.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.000
(Laughter)

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.000
Such it is with commitment devices.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:13.000
But despite my like for them,

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000
there's two nagging concerns

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000
that I've always had about commitment devices,

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.000
and you might feel this if you use them yourself.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.000
So the first is,

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.000
when you've got one of these devices going,

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.000
such as this contract to write everyday or pay,

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000
it's just a constant reminder

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000
that you have no self-control.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000
You're just telling yourself, "Without you, commitment device,

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.000
I am nothing, I have no self-discipline."

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.000
And then when you're ever in a situation

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:40.000
where you don't have a commitment device in place --

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000
like, "Oh my God, that person's offering me a doughnut,

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000
and I have no defense mechanism," --

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.000
you just eat it.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:49.000
So I don't like the way that they take the power away from you.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:52.000
I think self-discipline is something, it's like a muscle.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:55.000
The more you exercise it, the stronger it gets.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.000
The other problem with commitment devices

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.000
is that you can always weasel your way out of them.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000
You say, "Well, of course I can't write today,

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.000
because I'm giving a TEDTalk and I have five media interviews,

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:08.000
and then I'm going to a cocktail party and then I'll be drunk after that.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:11.000
And so there's no way that this is going to work."

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.000
So in effect, you are like Odysseus and the first mate

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000
in one person.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.000
You're putting yourself, you're binding yourself,

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.000
and you're weaseling your way out of it,

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.000
and then you're beating yourself up afterwards.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.000
So I've been working

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.000
for about a decade now

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.000
on finding other ways

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000
to change people's relationship to the future self

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000
without using commitment devices.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.000
In particular, I'm interested in the relationship

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.000
to the future financial self.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.000
And this is a timely issue.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.000
I'm talking about the topic of saving.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.000
Now saving is a classic two selves problem.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.000
The present self does not want to save at all.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.000
It wants to consume.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:53.000
Whereas the future self wants the present self to save.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.000
So this is a timely problem.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.000
We look at the savings rate

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:01.000
and it has been declining since the 1950s.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:04.000
At the same time, the Retirement Risk Index,

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:07.000
the chance of not being able to meet your needs in retirement,

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.000
has been increasing.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.000
And we're at a situation now

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.000
where for every three baby boomers,

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.000
the McKinsey Global Institute predicts

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:19.000
that two will not be able to meet their pre-retirement needs

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.000
while they're in retirement.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:24.000
So what can we do about this?

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.000
There's a philosopher, Derek Parfit,

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:30.000
who said some words that were inspiring to my coauthors and I.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.000
He said that, "We might neglect our future selves

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:37.000
because of some failure of belief or imagination."

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.000
That is to say,

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.000
we somehow might not believe that we're going to get old,

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.000
or we might not be able to imagine

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000
that we're going to get old some day.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.000
On the one hand, it sounds ridiculous.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000
Of course, we know that we're going to get old.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:53.000
But aren't there things that we believe and don't believe at the same time?

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:56.000
So my coauthors and I have used computers,

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.000
the greatest tool of our time,

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.000
to assist people's imagination

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.000
and help them imagine what it might be like

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.000
to go into the future.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:08.000
And I'll show you some of these tools right here.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.000
The first is called the distribution builder.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:13.000
It shows people what the future might be like

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:16.000
by showing them a hundred equally probable outcomes

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.000
that might be obtained in the future.

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:21.000
Each outcome is shown by one of these markers,

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.000
and each sits on a row

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.000
that represents a level of wealth and retirement.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.000
Being up at the top

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.000
means that you're enjoying a high income in retirement.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.000
Being down at the bottom

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.000
means that you're struggling to make ends meet.

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.000
When you make an investment,

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.000
what you're really saying is, "I accept

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.000
that any one of these 100 things

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.000
could happen to me and determine my wealth."

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:44.000
Now you can try to move your outcomes around.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:47.000
You can try to manipulate your fate, like this person is doing,

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.000
but it costs you something to do it.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:53.000
It means that you have to save more today.

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.000
Once you find an investment that you're happy with,

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.000
what people do is they click "done"

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.000
and the markers begin to disappear,

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.000
slowly, one by one.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.000
It simulates what it is like to invest in something

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:06.000
and to watch that investment pan out.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:09.000
At the end, there will only be one marker left standing

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:12.000
and it will determine our wealth in retirement.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.000
Yes, this person retired

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:18.000
at 150 percent of their working income in retirement.

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.000
They're making more money while retired

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.000
than they were making while they were working.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.000
If you're like most people,

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:28.000
just seeing that gave you a small sense of elation and joy --

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.000
just to think about making

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:33.000
50 percent more money in retirement than before.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.000
However, had you ended up on the very bottom,

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.000
it might have given you a slight sense

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.000
of dread and/or nausea

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:43.000
thinking about struggling to get by in retirement.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.000
By using this tool over and over

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:48.000
and simulating outcome after outcome,

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.000
people can understand

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:53.000
that the investments and savings that they undertake today

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.000
determine their well-being in the future.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:58.000
Now people are motivated through emotions,

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:01.000
but different people find different things motivating.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:04.000
This is a simulation

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:06.000
that uses graphics,

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.000
but other people find motivating what money can buy,

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.000
not just numbers.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.000
So here I made a distribution builder

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:15.000
where instead of showing numerical outcomes,

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:18.000
I show people what those outcomes will get you,

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.000
in particular apartments that you can afford

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:23.000
if you're retiring on 3,000, 2,500,

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:26.000
2,000 dollars per month and so on.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.000
As you move down the ladder of apartments,

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:31.000
you see that they get worse and worse.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:35.000
Some of them look like places I lived in as a graduate student.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:39.000
And as you get to the very bottom,

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.000
you're faced with the unfortunate reality

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:43.000
that if you don't save anything for retirement,

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:46.000
you won't be able to afford any housing at all.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.000
Those are actual pictures of actual apartments

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.000
renting for that amount

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.000
as advertised on the Internet.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.000
The last thing I'll show you,

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.000
the last behavioral time machine,

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:59.000
is something that I created with Hal Hershfield,

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:02.000
who was introduced to me by my coauthor on a previous project,

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.000
Bill Sharpe.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.000
And what it is

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.000
is an exploration into virtual reality.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:11.000
So what we do is we take pictures of people --

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.000
in this case, college-age people --

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:15.000
and we use software to age them

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:18.000
and show these people what they'll look like

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.000
when they're 60, 70, 80 years old.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.000
And we try to test

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:25.000
whether actually assisting your imagination

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.000
by looking at the face of your future self

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:29.000
can change you investment behavior.

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:32.000
So this is one of our experiments.

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:35.000
Here we see the face of the young subject on the left.

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:37.000
He's given a control

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.000
that allows him to adjust his savings rate.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:41.000
As he moves his savings rate down,

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.000
it means that he's saving zero

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:45.000
when it's all the way here at the left.

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:47.000
You can see his current annual income --

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:50.000
this is the percentage of his paycheck that he can take home today --

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:52.000
is quite high, 91 percent,

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.000
but his retirement income is quite low.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.000
He's going to retire on 44 percent

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:59.000
of what he earned while he was working.

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:02.000
If he saves the maximum legal amount,

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:04.000
his retirement income goes up,

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:06.000
but he's unhappy

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:09.000
because now he has less money on the left-hand side to spend today.

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:13.000
Other conditions show people the future self.

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:16.000
And from the future self's point of view, everything is in reverse.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.000
If you save very little,

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:20.000
the future self is unhappy

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:23.000
living on 44 percent of the income.

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:26.000
Whereas if the present self saves a lot,

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:28.000
the future self is delighted,

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:31.000
where the income is close up near 100 percent.

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:34.000
To bring this to a wider audience,

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:37.000
I've been working with Hal and Allianz

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:40.000
to create something we call the behavioral time machine,

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:43.000
in which you not only get to see yourself in the future,

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:46.000
but you get to see anticipated emotional reactions

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:49.000
to different levels of retirement wealth.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:51.000
So for instance,

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:53.000
here is somebody using the tool.

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.000
And just watch the facial expressions

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.000
as they move the slider.

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:59.000
The younger face gets happier and happier, saving nothing.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:01.000
The older face is miserable.

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:03.000
And slowly, slowly we're bringing it up to a moderate savings rate.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:05.000
And then it's a high savings rate.

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:07.000
The younger face is getting unhappy.

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:09.000
The older face is quite pleased

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:12.000
with the decision.

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:14.000
We're going to see if this has an effect on what people do.

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.000
And what's nice about it

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:19.000
is it's not something that biasing people actually,

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:21.000
because as one face smiles,

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:23.000
the other face frowns.

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:25.000
It's not telling you which way to put the slider,

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:28.000
it's just reminding you that you are

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.000
connected to and legally tied to

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.000
this future self.

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:35.000
Your decisions today are going to determine its well-being.

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:38.000
And that's something that's easy to forget.

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:41.000
This use of virtual reality

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:43.000
is not just good for making people look older.

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:45.000
There are programs you can get

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:47.000
to see how people might look

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:50.000
if they smoke, if they get too much exposure to the sun,

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:52.000
if they gain weight and so on.

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:54.000
And what's good is,

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:57.000
unlike in the experiments that Hal and myself ran with Russ Smith,

00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:59.000
you don't have to program these by yourself

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:02.000
in order to see the virtual reality.

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:05.000
There are applications you can get on smartphones for just a few dollars

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:07.000
that do the same thing.

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:09.000
This is actually a picture of Hal, my coauthor.

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:12.000
You might recognize him from the previous demos.

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:15.000
And just for kicks we ran his picture

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:18.000
through the balding, aging and weight gain software

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.000
to see how he would look.

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:23.000
Hal is here, so I think we owe it to him as well as yourself

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:26.000
to disabuse you of that last image.

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:29.000
And I'll close it there.

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:31.000
On behalf of Hal and myself,

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:33.000
I wish all the best to your present and future selves.

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:35.000
Thank you.

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:38.000
(Applause)
