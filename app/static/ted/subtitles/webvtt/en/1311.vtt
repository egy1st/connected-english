WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
I've been in Afghanistan for 21 years.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
I work for the Red Cross

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
and I'm a physical therapist.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
My job is to make arms and legs --

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
well it's not completely true.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
We do more than that.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
We provide the patients,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
the Afghan disabled,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
first with the physical rehabilitation

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
then with the social reintegration.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
It's a very logical plan,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
but it was not always like this.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
For many years, we were just providing them

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
with artificial limbs.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
It took quite many years

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.000
for the program to become what it is now.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
Today, I would like to tell you a story,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
the story of a big change,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
and the story of the people

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
who made this change possible.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
I arrived in Afghanistan

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000
in 1990

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
to work in a hospital

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
for war victims.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
And then, not only for war victims,

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
but it was for any kind of patient.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
I was also working

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
in the orthopedic center, we call it.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
This is the place where we make the legs.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
At that time

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
I found myself

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
in a strange situation.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
I felt not quite ready

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
for that job.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
There was so much to learn.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
There were so many things new to me.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
But it was a terrific job.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
But as soon as the fighting intensified,

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
the physical rehabilitation was suspended.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
There were many other things to do.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
So the orthopedic center was closed

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
because physical rehabilitation

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.000
was not considered a priority.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
It was a strange sensation.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000
Anyway, you know every time I make this speech --

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
it's not the first time -- but it's an emotion.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
It's something that comes out from the past.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
It's 21 years,

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
but they are still all there.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
Anyway, in 1992,

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
the Mujahideen took all Afghanistan.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
And the orthopedic center was closed.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
I was assigned to work for the homeless,

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
for the internally displaced people.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
But one day, something happened.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
I was coming back

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000
from a big food distribution in a mosque

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.000
where tens and tens of people

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.000
were squatting in terrible conditions.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000
I wanted to go home. I was driving.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
You know, when you want to forget,

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
you don't want to see things,

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000
so you just want to go to your room, to lock yourself inside

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.000
and say, "That's enough."

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
A bomb fell not far from my car --

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
well, far enough, but big noise.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.000
And everybody disappeared from the street.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000
The cars disappeared as well.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000
I ducked.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
And only one figure

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
remained in the middle of the road.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000
It was a man in a wheelchair

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000
desperately trying to move away.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
Well I'm not a particularly brave person,

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
I have to confess it,

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.000
but I could not just ignore him.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000
So I stopped the car

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000
and I went to help.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000
The man was without legs

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000
and only with one arm.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000
Behind him there was a child, his son,

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000
red in the face

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:51.000
in an effort to push the father.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000
So I took him into a safe place.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.000
And I ask, "What are you doing out in the street

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000
in this situation?"

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
"I work," he said.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.000
I wondered, what work?

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.000
And then I ask an even more stupid question:

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000
"Why don't you have the prostheses?

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000
Why don't you have the artificial legs?"

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.000
And he said, "The Red Cross has closed."

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.000
Well without thinking, I told him

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000
"Come tomorrow.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:25.000
We will provide you with a pair of legs."

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.000
The man, his name was Mahmoud,

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.000
and the child, whose name was Rafi, left.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.000
And then I said, "Oh, my God. What did I say?

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000
The center is closed,

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000
no staff around.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.000
Maybe the machinery is broken.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.000
Who is going to make the legs for him?"

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:50.000
So I hoped that he would not come.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.000
This is the streets of Kabul

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.000
in those days.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.000
So I said, "Well I will give him some money."

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000
And so the following day,

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.000
I went to the orthopedic center.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.000
And I spoke with a gatekeeper.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000
I was ready to tell him,

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.000
"Listen, if someone such-and-such comes tomorrow,

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.000
please tell him that it was a mistake.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000
Nothing can be done.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000
Give him some money."

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000
But Mahmoud and his son were already there.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000
And they were not alone.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:29.000
There were 15, maybe 20, people like him waiting.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:33.000
And there was some staff too.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.000
Among them there was my right-hand man,

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.000
Najmuddin.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.000
And the gatekeeper told me,

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:45.000
"They come everyday to see if the center will open."

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000
I said, "No.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.000
We have to go away. We cannot stay here."

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.000
They were bombing -- not very close -- but you could hear the noise of the bombs.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.000
So, "We cannot stay here, it's dangerous.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000
It's not a priority."

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:01.000
But Najmuddin told me, "Listen now, we're here."

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.000
At least we can start repairing the prostheses, the broken prostheses of the people

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.000
and maybe try to do something

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000
for people like Mahmoud."

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.000
I said, "No, please. We cannot do that.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.000
It's really dangerous.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.000
We have other things to do."

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.000
But they insisted.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000
When you have 20 people

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000
in front of you, looking at you

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.000
and you are the one who has to decide ...

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:28.000
So we started doing some repairs.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000
Also one of the physical therapists

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000
reported that Mahmoud

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000
could be provided with a leg,

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000
but not immediately.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.000
The legs were swollen

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.000
and the knees were stiff,

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000
so he needed a long preparation.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000
Believe me, I was worried

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.000
because I was breaking the rules.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.000
I was doing something

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.000
that I was not supposed to do.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000
In the evening,

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000
I went to speak with the bosses at the headquarters,

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.000
and I told them -- I lied --

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.000
I told them, "Listen, we are going to start

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.000
a couple of hours per day,

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.000
just a few repairs."

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.000
Maybe some of them are here now.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:10.000
(Laughter)

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.000
So we started.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:16.000
I was working, I was going everyday

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:19.000
to work for the homeless.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.000
And Najmuddin was staying there,

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.000
doing everything and reporting on the patients.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:26.000
He was telling me, "Patients are coming."

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.000
We knew that many more patients

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:31.000
could not come, prevented by the fighting.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.000
But people were coming.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:36.000
And Mahmoud was coming every day.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.000
And slowly, slowly

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.000
week after week

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.000
his legs were improving.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:47.000
The stump or cast prosthesis was made,

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.000
and he was starting

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:52.000
the real physical rehabilitation.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000
He was coming every day,

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.000
crossing the front line.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.000
A couple of times I crossed the front line

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:01.000
in the very place where Mahmoud and his son were crossing.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:04.000
I tell you, it was something so sinister

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:09.000
that I was astonished he could do it every day.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:13.000
But finally, the great day arrived.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.000
Mahmoud was going to be discharged

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.000
with his new legs.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.000
It was April, I remember,

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.000
a very beautiful day.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.000
April in Kabul is beautiful,

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:26.000
full of roses, full of flowers.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:29.000
We could not possibly stay indoors,

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:32.000
with all these sandbags at the windows.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:35.000
Very sad, dark.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:38.000
So we chose a small spot in the garden.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:41.000
And Mahmoud put on his prostheses,

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:44.000
the other patients did the same,

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000
and they started practicing

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.000
for the last time before being discharged.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000
Suddenly, they started fighting.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:54.000
Two groups of Mujahideen started fighting.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:57.000
We could hear in the air

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.000
the bullets passing.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.000
So we dashed, all of us,

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:04.000
towards the shelter.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.000
Mahmoud grabbed his son, I grabbed someone else.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.000
Everybody was grabbing something.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.000
And we ran.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.000
You know, 50 meters can be a long distance

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.000
if you are totally exposed,

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:19.000
but we managed to reach the shelter.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:22.000
Inside, all of us panting,

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:26.000
I sat a moment and I heard Rafi telling his father,

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:29.000
"Father, you can run faster than me."

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.000
(Laughter)

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:34.000
And Mahmoud, "Of course I can.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:37.000
I can run, and now you can go to school.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:40.000
No need of staying with me all the day

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.000
pushing my wheelchair."

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:44.000
Later on, we took them home.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.000
And I will never forget

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:49.000
Mahmoud and his son walking together

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:52.000
pushing the empty wheelchair.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:55.000
And then I understood,

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:59.000
physical rehabilitation is a priority.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:03.000
Dignity cannot wait for better times.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:08.000
From that day on, we never closed a single day.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.000
Well sometimes we were suspended for a few hours,

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:14.000
but we never, we never closed it again.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.000
I met Mahmoud one year later.

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:22.000
He was in good shape --

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:25.000
a bit thinner.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:28.000
He needed to change his prostheses --

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:31.000
a new pair of prostheses.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:33.000
I asked about his son.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.000
He told me, "He's at school. He'd doing quite well."

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:39.000
But I understood he wanted to tell me something.

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:43.000
So I asked him, "What is that?"

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.000
He was sweating.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:49.000
He was clearly embarrassed.

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:52.000
And he was standing in front of me,

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:55.000
his head down.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:59.000
He said, "You have taught me to walk.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:02.000
Thank you very much.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:06.000
Now help me not to be a beggar anymore."

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.000
That was the job.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:11.000
"My children are growing.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.000
I feel ashamed.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:16.000
I don't want them to be teased at school

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:19.000
by the other students."

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.000
I said, "Okay."

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.000
I thought, how much money do I have in my pocket?

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.000
Just to give him some money.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.000
It was the easiest way.

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.000
He read my mind,

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:34.000
and he said, "I ask for a job."

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:38.000
And then he added something

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:42.000
I will never forget for the rest of my life.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:48.000
He said, "I am a scrap of a man,

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.000
but if you help me,

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:53.000
I'm ready to do anything,

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:57.000
even if I have to crawl on the ground."

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.000
And then he sat down.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:03.000
I sat down too with goosebumps everywhere.

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:11.000
Legless, with only one arm,

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:14.000
illiterate,

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:17.000
unskilled --

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:21.000
what job for him?

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:25.000
Najmuddin told me, "Well we have a vacancy

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.000
in the carpentry shop."

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:32.000
"What?" I said, "Stop."

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:37.000
"Well yes, we need to increase the production of feet.

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:40.000
We need to employ someone

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:44.000
to glue and to screw the sole of the feet.

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:47.000
We need to increase the production."

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:49.000
"Excuse me?"

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:53.000
I could not believe.

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:56.000
And then he said,

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:59.000
"No, we can modify the workbench

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.000
maybe to put a special stool,

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:05.000
a special anvil, special vice,

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:07.000
and maybe an electric screwdriver."

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:10.000
I said, "Listen, it's insane.

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:13.000
And it's even cruel to think of anything like this.

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:16.000
That's a production line and a very fast one.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.000
It's cruel

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:20.000
to offer him a job

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:25.000
knowing that he's going to fail."

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:29.000
But with Najmuddin, we cannot discuss.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:35.000
So the only things I could manage to obtain

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:39.000
was a kind of a compromise.

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:41.000
Only one week --

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:44.000
one week try and not a single day more.

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:46.000
One week later,

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:50.000
Mahmoud was the fastest in the production line.

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:53.000
I told Najmuddin, "That's a trick.

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.000
I can't believe it."

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.000
The production was up 20 percent.

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:00.000
"It's a trick, it's a trick," I said.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.000
And then I asked for verification.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:05.000
It was true.

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:08.000
The comment of Najmuddin was Mahmoud has something to prove.

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:10.000
I understood

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:13.000
that I was wrong again.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:15.000
Mahmoud had looked taller.

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:21.000
I remember him sitting behind the workbench smiling.

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:24.000
He was a new man,

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:27.000
taller again.

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:29.000
Of course, I understood

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:33.000
that what made him stand tall --

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:35.000
yeah they were the legs, thank you very much --

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:38.000
but as a first step,

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:40.000
it was the dignity.

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:43.000
He has regained his full dignity

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:45.000
thanks to that job.

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:47.000
So of course, I understood.

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:50.000
And then we started a new policy --

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:52.000
a new policy completely different.

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:54.000
We decided to employ

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:56.000
as many disabled as possible

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:58.000
to train them in any possible job.

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:01.000
It became a policy of "positive discrimination,"

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:04.000
we call it now.

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:06.000
And you know what?

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:08.000
It's good for everybody.

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:11.000
Everybody benefits from that --

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:13.000
those employed, of course,

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:15.000
because they get a job

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:17.000
and dignity.

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:19.000
But also for the newcomers.

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:22.000
They are 7,000 every year --

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:24.000
people coming for the first time.

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:26.000
And you should see the faces of these people

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:29.000
when they realize that those assisting them are like them.

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:31.000
Sometimes you see them,

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:34.000
they look, "Oh."

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:36.000
And you see the faces.

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:41.000
And then the surprise turns into hope.

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:46.000
And it's easy for me as well to train someone

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:49.000
who has already passed through the experience of disability.

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:53.000
Poof, they learn much faster -- the motivation,

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:55.000
the empathy they can establish with the patient

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:58.000
is completely different, completely.

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:02.000
Scraps of men do not exist.

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:04.000
People like Mahmoud

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:07.000
are agents of change.

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:10.000
And when you start changing, you cannot stop.

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:12.000
So employing people, yes,

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:15.000
but also we started programming projects

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:17.000
of microfinance, education.

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:19.000
And when you start, you cannot stop.

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:21.000
So you do vocational training,

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:24.000
home education for those who cannot go to school.

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:26.000
Physical therapies can be done, not only in the orthopedic center,

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:28.000
but also in the houses of the people.

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:32.000
There is always a better way to do things.

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:35.000
That's Najmuddin, the one with the white coat.

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:38.000
Terrible Najmuddin, is that one.

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:40.000
I have learned a lot

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:42.000
from people like Najmuddin, Mahmoud, Rafi.

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:44.000
They are my teachers.

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:47.000
I have a wish, a big wish,

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:50.000
that this way of working, this way of thinking,

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:53.000
is going to be implemented in other countries.

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:57.000
There are plenty of countries at war like Afghanistan.

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:01.000
It is possible and it is not difficult.

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:03.000
All we have to do

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:06.000
is to listen to the people

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:09.000
that we are supposed assist,

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:11.000
to make them part

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:14.000
of the decision-making process

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:17.000
and then, of course, to adapt.

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:20.000
This is my big wish.

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:24.000
Well don't think that the changes in Afghanistan are over;

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:26.000
not at all. We are going on.

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:29.000
Recently we have just started a program,

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:31.000
a sport program --

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:33.000
basketball for wheelchair users.

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:36.000
We transport the wheelchairs everywhere.

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:39.000
We have several teams in the main part of Afghanistan.

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:41.000
At the beginning,

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:44.000
when Anajulina told me,

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:46.000
"We would like to start it,"

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:48.000
I hesitated.

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:50.000
I said, "No," you can imagine.

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:52.000
I said, "No, no, no, no, we can't."

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:54.000
And then I asked the usual question:

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:56.000
"Is it a priority?

00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:59.000
Is it really necessary?"

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:01.000
Well now you should see me.

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:04.000
I never miss a single training session.

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:07.000
The night before a match I'm very nervous.

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:11.000
And you should see me during the match.

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:14.000
I shout like a true Italian.

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:17.000
(Laughter)

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:21.000
What's next? What is going to be the next change?

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:23.000
Well I don't know yet,

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:25.000
but I'm sure Najmuddin and his friends,

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:27.000
they have it already in mind.

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:30.000
That was my story. Thank you very much.

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:41.000
(Applause)
