00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
I've spent the last decade

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
subjecting myself to pain and humiliation,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
hopefully for a good cause,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
which is self-improvement.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
And I've done this in three parts.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
So first I started with the mind.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
And I decided to try to get smarter

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
by reading the entire Encyclopedia Britannica

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
from A to Z --

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
or, more precisely, from "a-ak" to "Zywiec."

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
And here's a little image of that.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
And this was an amazing year.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
It was really a fascinating journey.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
It was painful at times,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
especially for those around me.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
My wife started to fine me one dollar

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
for every irrelevant fact I inserted into conversation.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000
So it had its downsides.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
But after that,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
I decided to work on the spirit.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
As I mentioned last year,

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
I grew up with no religion at all.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
I'm Jewish,

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
but I'm Jewish in the same way the Olive Garden is Italian.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
(Laughter)

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
Not really.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
But I decided to learn about the Bible and my heritage

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
by actually diving in

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
and trying to live it and immerse myself in it.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
So I decided to follow all the rules of the Bible.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
And from the Ten Commandments

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
to growing my beard --

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
because Leviticus says you cannot shave.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
So this is what I looked like by the end.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
Thank you for that reaction.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
(Laughter)

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
I look a little like Moses, or Ted Kaczynski.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
I got both of them.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
So there was the topiary there.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
And there's the sheep.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
Now the final part of the trilogy

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
was I wanted to focus on the body

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
and try to be the healthiest person I could be,

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
the healthiest person alive.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
So that's what I've been doing the last couple of years.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
And I just finished a couple of months ago.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
And I have to say, thank God.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
Because living so healthily was killing me.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
(Laughter)

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
It was so overwhelming,

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
because the amount of things you have to do,

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
it's just mind-boggling.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
I was listening to all the experts

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
and talking to sort of a board of medical advisers.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
And they were telling me

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
all the things I had to do.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
I had to eat right,

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000
exercise, meditate, pet dogs,

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
because that lowers the blood pressure.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
I wrote the book on a treadmill,

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
and it took me about a thousand miles

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
to write the book.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
I had to put on sunscreen.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
This was no small feat,

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
because if you listen to dermatologists,

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000
they say that you should have a shot glass full of sunscreen.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
And you have to reapply it every two to four hours.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
So I think half of my book advance

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
went into sunscreen.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
I was like a glazed doughnut

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
for most of the year.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
There was the washing of hands.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
I had to do that properly.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
And my immunologist told me

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000
that I should also wipe down

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000
all of the remote controls and iPhones in my house,

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000
because those are just orgies of germs.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
So that took a lot of time.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000
I also tried to be the safest person I could be,

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
because that's a part of health.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
I was inspired

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000
by the Danish Safety Council.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
They started a public campaign

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000
that says, "A walking helmet is a good helmet."

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.000
So they believe you should not just wear helmets for biking,

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.000
but also for walking around.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.000
And you can see there

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
they're shopping with their helmets.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
(Laughter)

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000
Well yeah, I tried that.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000
Now it's a little extreme, I admit.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000
But if you think about this,

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.000
this is actually -- the "Freakonomics" authors wrote about this --

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.000
that more people die on a per mile basis

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000
from drunk walking

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000
than from drunk driving.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000
So something to think about tonight

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.000
if you've had a couple.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000
So I finished,

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
and it was a success in a sense.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.000
All of the markers went in the right direction.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.000
My cholesterol went down, I lost weight,

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:09.000
my wife stopped telling me that I looked pregnant.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000
So that was nice.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000
And it was successful overall.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000
But I also learned that I was too healthy,

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000
and that was unhealthy.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.000
I was so focused on doing all these things

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.000
that I was neglecting my friends and family.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000
And as Dan Buettner can tell you,

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000
having a strong social network

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000
is so crucial to our health.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000
So I finished.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000
And I kind of went overboard

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.000
on the week after the project was over.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000
I went to the dark side,

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000
and I just indulged myself.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000
It was like something out of Caligula.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000
(Laughter)

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000
Without the sex part.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000
Because I have three young kids,

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000
so that wasn't happening.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000
But the over-eating and over-drinking, definitely.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:02.000
And I finally have stabilized.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000
So now I'm back

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.000
to adopting many -- not all; I don't wear a helmet anymore --

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.000
but dozens of healthy behaviors

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.000
that I adopted during my year.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.000
It was really a life-changing project.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.000
And I, of course, don't have time to go into all of them.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.000
Let me just tell you two really quickly.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000
The first is -- and this was surprising to me;

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000
I didn't expect this to come out --

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.000
but I live a much quieter life now.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.000
Because we live in such a noisy world.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:36.000
There's trains and planes and cars

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.000
and Bill O'Reilly, he's very noisy.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.000
(Laughter)

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:47.000
And this is a real underestimated, under-appreciated health hazard --

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.000
not just because it harms our hearing, which it obviously does,

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.000
but it actually initiates

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.000
the fight-or-flight response.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.000
A loud noise will get your fight-or-flight response going.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.000
And this, over the years,

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.000
can cause real damage, cardiovascular damage.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.000
The World Health Organization just did a big study

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.000
that they published this year.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.000
And it was done in Europe.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.000
And they estimated

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:17.000
that 1.6 million years of healthy living

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.000
are lost every year in Europe

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.000
because of noise pollution.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.000
So they think it's actually very deadly.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000
And by the way,

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.000
it's also terrible for your brain.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:34.000
It really impairs cognition.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000
And our Founding Fathers knew about this.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.000
When they wrote the Constitution,

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:42.000
they put dirt all over the cobblestones outside the hall

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.000
so that they could concentrate.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.000
So without noise reduction technology,

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.000
our country would not exist.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000
So as a patriot,

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000
I felt it was important to --

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.000
I wear all the earplugs and the earphones,

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.000
and it's really improved my life

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.000
in a surprising and unexpected way.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.000
And the second point I want to make, the final point,

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:11.000
is that -- and it's actually been a theme of TEDMED --

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:15.000
that joy is so important to your health,

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:19.000
that very few of these behaviors

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.000
will stick with me

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:26.000
unless there's some sense of pleasure and joy in them.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.000
And just to give you one instance of this:

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000
food.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:34.000
The junk food industry

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000
is really great

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.000
at pressing our pleasure buttons

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:41.000
and figuring out what's the most pleasurable.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.000
But I think we can use their techniques

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.000
and apply them to healthy food.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.000
To give just one example,

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:50.000
we love crunchiness, mouthfeel.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:54.000
So I basically have tried to incorporate crunchiness

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.000
into a lot of my recipes --

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.000
throw in some sunflower seeds.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000
And you can almost trick yourself

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000
into thinking you're eating Doritos.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000
(Laughter)

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.000
And it has made me a healthier person.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.000
So that is it.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.000
The book about it comes out in April.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000
It's called "Drop Dead Healthy."

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.000
And I hope that I don't get sick during the book tour.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.000
That's my greatest hope.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.000
So thank you very much.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:21.000
(Applause)
