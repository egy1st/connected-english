00:00:00.801 --> 00:00:04.173
There have been many revolutions
over the last century,

00:00:04.197 --> 00:00:08.417
but perhaps none as significant
as the longevity revolution.

00:00:09.242 --> 00:00:13.592
We are living on average
today 34 years longer

00:00:13.616 --> 00:00:16.094
than our great-grandparents did --
think about that.

00:00:16.118 --> 00:00:19.372
That's an entire second adult lifetime

00:00:19.396 --> 00:00:21.170
that's been added to our lifespan.

00:00:21.734 --> 00:00:23.081
And yet, for the most part,

00:00:23.105 --> 00:00:26.476
our culture has not come to terms
with what this means.

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:29.265
We're still living with the old paradigm

00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:31.266
of age as an arch.

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:33.206
That's the metaphor, the old metaphor.

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:35.340
You're born, you peak at midlife

00:00:35.364 --> 00:00:37.476
and decline into decrepitude.

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.173
(Laughter)

00:00:39.197 --> 00:00:41.315
Age as pathology.

00:00:42.204 --> 00:00:46.476
But many people today -- philosophers,
artists, doctors, scientists --

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.824
are taking a new look
at what I call "the third act" --

00:00:49.848 --> 00:00:51.870
the last three decades of life.

00:00:52.364 --> 00:00:57.476
They realize that this is actually
a developmental stage of life

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:59.890
with its own significance,

00:00:59.914 --> 00:01:04.963
as different from midlife
as adolescence is from childhood.

00:01:05.732 --> 00:01:08.671
And they are asking --
we should all be asking:

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:11.164
How do we use this time?

00:01:11.684 --> 00:01:13.612
How do we live it successfully?

00:01:13.636 --> 00:01:17.169
What is the appropriate
new metaphor for aging?

00:01:17.594 --> 00:01:21.205
I've spent the last year researching
and writing about this subject.

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:26.476
And I have come to find
that a more appropriate metaphor for aging

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:28.040
is a staircase --

00:01:29.071 --> 00:01:32.158
the upward ascension of the human spirit,

00:01:32.182 --> 00:01:36.476
bringing us into wisdom,
wholeness, and authenticity.

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:38.809
Age not at all as pathology.

00:01:38.833 --> 00:01:40.476
Age as potential.

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:41.919
And guess what?

00:01:41.943 --> 00:01:44.583
This potential is not for the lucky few.

00:01:44.607 --> 00:01:47.683
It turns out, most people over 50

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:52.987
feel better, are less stressed,
less hostile, less anxious.

00:01:53.011 --> 00:01:56.477
We tend to see commonalities
more than differences.

00:01:56.501 --> 00:01:59.311
Some of the studies even say
we're happier.

00:01:59.335 --> 00:02:00.365
(Laughter)

00:02:00.389 --> 00:02:03.109
This is not what I expected, trust me.

00:02:03.133 --> 00:02:05.270
I come from a long line of depressives.

00:02:05.928 --> 00:02:08.248
As I was approaching my late 40s,

00:02:08.272 --> 00:02:10.065
when I would wake up in the morning,

00:02:10.089 --> 00:02:12.520
my first six thoughts
would all be negative.

00:02:12.544 --> 00:02:13.706
And I got scared.

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:17.013
I thought, "Oh my gosh.
I'm going to become a crotchety old lady."

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:22.041
But now that I am actually smack-dab
in the middle of my own third act,

00:02:22.065 --> 00:02:24.476
I realize I've never been happier.

00:02:25.142 --> 00:02:28.478
I have such a powerful
feeling of well-being.

00:02:29.524 --> 00:02:30.772
And I've discovered

00:02:31.376 --> 00:02:33.353
that when you're inside oldness,

00:02:33.377 --> 00:02:35.730
as opposed to looking
at it from the outside,

00:02:35.754 --> 00:02:37.024
fear subsides.

00:02:37.048 --> 00:02:39.380
You realize you're still yourself --

00:02:39.404 --> 00:02:40.760
maybe even more so.

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:45.490
Picasso once said, "It takes
a long time to become young."

00:02:45.514 --> 00:02:47.682
(Laughter)

00:02:47.706 --> 00:02:49.556
I don't want to romanticize aging.

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:51.255
Obviously, there's no guarantee

00:02:51.279 --> 00:02:53.714
that it can be a time
of fruition and growth.

00:02:54.421 --> 00:02:56.081
Some of it is a matter of luck.

00:02:56.105 --> 00:02:58.645
Some of it, obviously, is genetic.

00:02:58.669 --> 00:03:00.793
One third of it, in fact, is genetic.

00:03:00.817 --> 00:03:03.080
And there isn't much we can do about that.

00:03:03.555 --> 00:03:08.450
But that means that two-thirds
of how well we do in the third act,

00:03:08.474 --> 00:03:10.300
we can do something about.

00:03:10.981 --> 00:03:13.247
We're going to discuss what we can do

00:03:13.271 --> 00:03:16.247
to make these added years
really successful,

00:03:16.698 --> 00:03:19.067
and use them to make a difference.

00:03:19.848 --> 00:03:22.040
Now, let me say something
about the staircase,

00:03:22.064 --> 00:03:26.081
which may seem like an odd
metaphor for seniors,

00:03:26.105 --> 00:03:29.068
given the fact that many seniors
are challenged by stairs.

00:03:29.092 --> 00:03:30.406
(Laughter)

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:32.400
Myself included.

00:03:33.888 --> 00:03:39.119
As you may know, the entire world
operates on a universal law:

00:03:39.143 --> 00:03:42.284
entropy, the second law of thermodynamics.

00:03:42.674 --> 00:03:45.563
Entropy means that everything
in the world -- everything --

00:03:45.587 --> 00:03:47.749
is in a state of decline and decay --

00:03:47.773 --> 00:03:48.946
the arch.

00:03:49.389 --> 00:03:52.465
There's only one exception
to this universal law,

00:03:53.188 --> 00:03:54.808
and that is the human spirit,

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:59.452
which can continue to evolve
upwards, the staircase,

00:03:59.476 --> 00:04:04.051
bringing us into wholeness,
authenticity, and wisdom.

00:04:04.404 --> 00:04:06.895
And here's an example of what I mean.

00:04:06.919 --> 00:04:08.976
This upward ascension

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.535
can happen even in the face
of extreme physical challenges.

00:04:12.559 --> 00:04:16.747
About three years ago,
I read an article in the New York Times.

00:04:16.872 --> 00:04:18.912
It was about a man named Neil Selinger --

00:04:18.936 --> 00:04:21.614
57 years old, a retired lawyer,

00:04:21.638 --> 00:04:24.713
who had joined the writers'
group at Sarah Lawrence,

00:04:24.737 --> 00:04:26.992
where he found his writer's voice.

00:04:27.576 --> 00:04:28.793
Two years later,

00:04:28.817 --> 00:04:33.143
he was diagnosed with ALS,
commonly known as Lou Gehrig's disease.

00:04:33.167 --> 00:04:35.530
It's a terrible disease. It's fatal.

00:04:35.554 --> 00:04:39.042
It wastes the body,
but the mind remains intact.

00:04:39.627 --> 00:04:42.603
In this article,
Mr. Selinger wrote the following

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.459
to describe what was happening to him.

00:04:46.269 --> 00:04:47.511
And I quote:

00:04:48.372 --> 00:04:50.348
"As my muscles weakened,

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:52.975
my writing became stronger.

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:56.273
As I slowly lost my speech,

00:04:56.712 --> 00:04:58.330
I gained my voice.

00:04:59.206 --> 00:05:01.368
As I diminished, I grew.

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:03.717
As I lost so much,

00:05:03.741 --> 00:05:06.519
I finally started to find myself."

00:05:08.432 --> 00:05:09.684
Neil Selinger, to me,

00:05:09.708 --> 00:05:13.089
is the embodiment
of mounting the staircase

00:05:13.113 --> 00:05:14.621
in his third act.

00:05:15.642 --> 00:05:18.380
Now we're all born with spirit, all of us,

00:05:18.404 --> 00:05:22.548
but sometimes it gets tamped down
beneath the challenges of life,

00:05:22.572 --> 00:05:24.429
violence, abuse, neglect.

00:05:25.507 --> 00:05:28.087
Perhaps our parents
suffered from depression.

00:05:28.111 --> 00:05:33.017
Perhaps they weren't able to love us
beyond how we performed in the world.

00:05:33.936 --> 00:05:37.976
Perhaps we still suffer
from a psychic pain, a wound.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.565
Perhaps we feel
that many of our relationships

00:05:40.589 --> 00:05:41.976
have not had closure.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.508
And so we can feel unfinished.

00:05:45.563 --> 00:05:49.019
Perhaps the task of the third act

00:05:49.131 --> 00:05:52.299
is to finish up the task
of finishing ourselves.

00:05:53.405 --> 00:05:58.954
For me, it began as I was approaching
my third act, my 60th birthday.

00:05:59.642 --> 00:06:01.154
How was I supposed to live it?

00:06:01.563 --> 00:06:04.475
What was I supposed to accomplish
in this final act?

00:06:04.499 --> 00:06:08.102
And I realized that,
in order to know where I was going,

00:06:08.682 --> 00:06:10.234
I had to know where I'd been.

00:06:10.849 --> 00:06:14.976
And so I went back
and I studied my first two acts,

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.623
trying to see who I was then,

00:06:17.647 --> 00:06:23.090
who I really was, not who my parents
or other people told me I was,

00:06:23.114 --> 00:06:24.740
or treated me like I was.

00:06:24.764 --> 00:06:25.932
But who was I?

00:06:25.956 --> 00:06:28.745
Who were my parents --
not as parents, but as people?

00:06:29.753 --> 00:06:31.458
Who were my grandparents?

00:06:31.482 --> 00:06:33.248
How did they treat my parents?

00:06:33.272 --> 00:06:34.595
These kinds of things.

00:06:37.305 --> 00:06:39.915
I discovered, a couple of years later,

00:06:39.939 --> 00:06:42.916
that this process that I had gone through

00:06:42.940 --> 00:06:46.680
is called by psychologists
"doing a life review."

00:06:46.704 --> 00:06:50.570
And they say it can give new significance
and clarity and meaning

00:06:50.594 --> 00:06:52.036
to a person's life.

00:06:52.690 --> 00:06:55.362
You may discover, as I did,

00:06:55.386 --> 00:06:58.362
that a lot of things
that you used to think were your fault,

00:06:59.326 --> 00:07:02.111
a lot of things you used
to think about yourself,

00:07:02.135 --> 00:07:04.223
really had nothing to do with you.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.976
It wasn't your fault; you're just fine.

00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:11.401
And you're able to go back
and forgive them.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:13.352
And forgive yourself.

00:07:13.959 --> 00:07:16.638
You're able to free yourself

00:07:17.146 --> 00:07:18.356
from your past.

00:07:18.912 --> 00:07:22.380
You can work to change
your relationship to your past.

00:07:23.134 --> 00:07:25.037
Now while I was writing about this,

00:07:25.061 --> 00:07:28.273
I came upon a book called
"Man's Search for Meaning"

00:07:28.297 --> 00:07:29.798
by Viktor Frankl.

00:07:29.822 --> 00:07:32.397
Viktor Frankl was a German psychiatrist

00:07:32.421 --> 00:07:35.182
who'd spent five years
in a Nazi concentration camp.

00:07:35.722 --> 00:07:37.963
And he wrote that,
while he was in the camp,

00:07:38.674 --> 00:07:42.127
he could tell, should
they ever be released,

00:07:42.151 --> 00:07:46.473
which of the people would be OK,
and which would not.

00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:48.371
And he wrote this:

00:07:52.115 --> 00:07:54.764
"Everything you have in life
can be taken from you

00:07:54.788 --> 00:07:56.141
except one thing:

00:07:56.904 --> 00:08:01.855
your freedom to choose
how you will respond to the situation.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.650
This is what determines
the quality of the life we've lived --

00:08:06.674 --> 00:08:08.730
not whether we've been rich or poor,

00:08:08.754 --> 00:08:10.486
famous or unknown,

00:08:10.510 --> 00:08:11.939
healthy or suffering.

00:08:12.714 --> 00:08:18.363
What determines our quality of life
is how we relate to these realities,

00:08:18.387 --> 00:08:20.539
what kind of meaning we assign them,

00:08:20.563 --> 00:08:23.730
what kind of attitude
we cling to about them,

00:08:23.754 --> 00:08:26.554
what state of mind
we allow them to trigger."

00:08:27.746 --> 00:08:30.429
Perhaps the central purpose
of the third act

00:08:30.453 --> 00:08:34.430
is to go back and to try, if appropriate,

00:08:34.454 --> 00:08:38.064
to change our relationship to the past.

00:08:38.714 --> 00:08:41.896
It turns out that cognitive research shows

00:08:41.920 --> 00:08:43.700
when we are able to do this,

00:08:43.724 --> 00:08:46.303
it manifests neurologically --

00:08:46.327 --> 00:08:49.420
neural pathways are created in the brain.

00:08:49.444 --> 00:08:51.421
You see, if you have, over time,

00:08:51.445 --> 00:08:54.848
reacted negatively
to past events and people,

00:08:54.872 --> 00:08:57.154
neural pathways are laid down

00:08:57.178 --> 00:09:00.615
by chemical and electrical signals
that are sent through the brain.

00:09:00.976 --> 00:09:04.446
And over time, these neural pathways
become hardwired.

00:09:04.470 --> 00:09:07.296
They become the norm --
even if it's bad for us,

00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:10.098
because it causes us stress and anxiety.

00:09:10.929 --> 00:09:12.389
If, however,

00:09:12.413 --> 00:09:16.149
we can go back and alter our relationship,

00:09:16.173 --> 00:09:20.469
re-vision our relationship
to past people and events,

00:09:20.493 --> 00:09:22.442
neural pathways can change.

00:09:22.466 --> 00:09:26.424
And if we can maintain
the more positive feelings

00:09:26.448 --> 00:09:27.605
about the past,

00:09:27.629 --> 00:09:29.431
that becomes the new norm.

00:09:29.455 --> 00:09:32.034
It's like resetting a thermostat.

00:09:32.872 --> 00:09:35.936
It's not having experiences

00:09:35.960 --> 00:09:38.392
that makes us wise.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:44.269
It's reflecting on the experiences
that we've had that makes us wise

00:09:44.293 --> 00:09:46.270
and that helps us become whole,

00:09:46.294 --> 00:09:48.507
brings wisdom and authenticity.

00:09:48.531 --> 00:09:51.272
It helps us become
what we might have been.

00:09:52.405 --> 00:09:54.642
Women start off whole, don't we?

00:09:54.666 --> 00:09:57.438
I mean, as girls, we're feisty --
"Yeah? Who says?"

00:09:57.462 --> 00:09:58.512
(Laughter)

00:09:58.536 --> 00:09:59.701
We have agency.

00:09:59.725 --> 00:10:02.175
We are the subjects of our own lives.

00:10:02.199 --> 00:10:03.583
But very often,

00:10:03.607 --> 00:10:06.192
many, if not most of us,
when we hit puberty,

00:10:06.216 --> 00:10:09.000
we start worrying
about fitting in and being popular.

00:10:09.579 --> 00:10:13.555
And we become the subjects
and objects of other people's lives.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.020
But now, in our third acts,

00:10:16.770 --> 00:10:21.379
it may be possible for us
to circle back to where we started,

00:10:22.070 --> 00:10:24.577
and know it for the first time.

00:10:24.969 --> 00:10:26.382
And if we can do that,

00:10:26.406 --> 00:10:28.972
it will not just be for ourselves.

00:10:29.618 --> 00:10:33.048
Older women are the largest
demographic in the world.

00:10:33.833 --> 00:10:37.163
If we can go back and redefine ourselves

00:10:37.187 --> 00:10:38.770
and become whole,

00:10:38.794 --> 00:10:42.679
this will create
a cultural shift in the world,

00:10:43.548 --> 00:10:46.769
and it will give an example
to younger generations

00:10:46.793 --> 00:10:49.658
so that they can reconceive
their own lifespan.

00:10:49.682 --> 00:10:50.952
Thank you very much.

00:10:50.976 --> 00:10:57.865
(Applause)
