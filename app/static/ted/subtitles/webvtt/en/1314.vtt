00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
There's a poem written

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
by a very famous English poet

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
at the end of the 19th century.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
It was said to echo in Churchill's brain

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
in the 1930s.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
And the poem goes:

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
"On the idle hill of summer,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
lazy with the flow of streams,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
hark I hear a distant drummer,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
drumming like a sound in dreams,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
far and near and low and louder on the roads of earth go by,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
dear to friend and food to powder,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
soldiers marching,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
soon to die."

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Those who are interested in poetry,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
the poem is "A Shropshire Lad" written by A.E. Housman.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
But what Housman understood,

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
and you hear it in the symphonies of Nielsen too,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
was that the long, hot, silvan summers

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
of stability of the 19th century

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
were coming to a close,

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
and that we were about to move

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
into one of those terrifying periods of history

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
when power changes.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
And these are always periods, ladies and gentlemen,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
accompanied by turbulence,

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
and all too often by blood.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
And my message for you

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
is that I believe we are condemned, if you like,

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
to live at just one of those moments in history

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
when the gimbals upon which

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
the established order of power is beginning to change

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
and the new look of the world,

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
the new powers that exist in the world,

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
are beginning to take form.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
And these are -- and we see it very clearly today --

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
nearly always highly turbulent times, highly difficult times,

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
and all too often very bloody times.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
By the way, it happens about once every century.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
You might argue that the last time it happened --

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
and that's what Housman felt coming and what Churchill felt too --

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
was that when power passed from the old nations,

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
the old powers of Europe,

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
across the Atlantic to the new emerging power

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
of the United States of America --

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
the beginning of the American century.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
And of course, into the vacuum

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
where the too-old European powers used to be

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
were played the two bloody catastrophes

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
of the last century --

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
the one in the first part and the one in the second part: the two great World Wars.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
Mao Zedong used to refer to them as the European civil wars,

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000
and it's probably a more accurate way of describing them.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
Well, ladies and gentlemen,

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
we live at one of those times.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
But for us, I want to talk about three factors today.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
And the first of these, the first two of these,

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
is about a shift in power.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000
And the second is about some new dimension which I want to refer to,

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
which has never quite happened in the way it's happening now.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
But let's talk about the shifts of power that are occurring to the world.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
And what is happening today

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
is, in one sense, frightening

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
because it's never happened before.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
We have seen lateral shifts of power --

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000
the power of Greece passed to Rome

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
and the power shifts that occurred

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000
during the European civilizations --

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
but we are seeing something slightly different.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
For power is not just moving laterally

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000
from nation to nation.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
It's also moving vertically.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
What's happening today is that the power that was encased,

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
held to accountability, held to the rule of law,

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
within the institution of the nation state

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000
has now migrated in very large measure onto the global stage.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
The globalization of power --

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
we talk about the globalization of markets,

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.000
but actually it's the globalization of real power.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
And where, at the nation state level

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000
that power is held to accountability

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000
subject to the rule of law,

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.000
on the international stage it is not.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.000
The international stage and the global stage where power now resides:

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.000
the power of the Internet, the power of the satellite broadcasters,

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.000
the power of the money changers --

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000
this vast money-go-round

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.000
that circulates now 32 times the amount of money necessary

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.000
for the trade it's supposed to be there to finance --

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000
the money changers, if you like,

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000
the financial speculators

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000
that have brought us all to our knees quite recently,

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000
the power of the multinational corporations

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.000
now developing budgets

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000
often bigger than medium-sized countries.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000
These live in a global space

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
which is largely unregulated,

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.000
not subject to the rule of law,

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000
and in which people may act free of constraint.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.000
Now that suits the powerful

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000
up to a moment.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000
It's always suitable for those who have the most power

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000
to operate in spaces without constraint,

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000
but the lesson of history is that, sooner or later,

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000
unregulated space --

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000
space not subject to the rule of law --

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.000
becomes populated, not just by the things you wanted --

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000
international trade, the Internet, etc. --

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000
but also by the things you don't want --

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.000
international criminality, international terrorism.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000
The revelation of 9/11

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:39.000
is that even if you are the most powerful nation on earth,

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.000
nevertheless,

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000
those who inhabit that space can attack you

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000
even in your most iconic of cities

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000
one bright September morning.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000
It's said that something like 60 percent

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.000
of the four million dollars that was taken to fund 9/11

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.000
actually passed through the institutions of the Twin Towers

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000
which 9/11 destroyed.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000
You see, our enemies also use this space --

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000
the space of mass travel, the Internet, satellite broadcasters --

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000
to be able to get around their poison,

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000
which is about destroying our systems and our ways.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000
Sooner or later,

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000
sooner or later,

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000
the rule of history

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000
is that where power goes

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.000
governance must follow.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000
And if it is therefore the case, as I believe it is,

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000
that one of the phenomenon of our time

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000
is the globalization of power,

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.000
then it follows that one of the challenges of our time

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.000
is to bring governance to the global space.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.000
And I believe that the decades ahead of us now

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:39.000
will be to a greater or lesser extent turbulent

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.000
the more or less we are able to achieve that aim:

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.000
to bring governance to the global space.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000
Now notice, I'm not talking about government.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.000
I'm not talking about setting up

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.000
some global democratic institution.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000
My own view, by the way, ladies and gentlemen,

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.000
is that this is unlikely to be done

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000
by spawning more U.N. institutions.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.000
If we didn't have the U.N., we'd have to invent it.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000
The world needs an international forum.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:05.000
It needs a means by which you can legitimize international action.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000
But when it comes to governance of the global space,

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.000
my guess is this won't happen

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000
through the creation of more U.N. institutions.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.000
It will actually happen by the powerful coming together

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000
and making treaty-based systems,

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.000
treaty-based agreements,

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.000
to govern that global space.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.000
And if you look, you can see them happening, already beginning to emerge.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.000
The World Trade Organization: treaty-based organization,

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000
entirely treaty-based,

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.000
and yet, powerful enough to hold even the most powerful, the United States,

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000
to account if necessary.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000
Kyoto: the beginnings of struggling to create

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.000
a treaty-based organization.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.000
The G20:

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000
we know now that we have to put together an institution

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000
which is capable of bringing governance

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.000
to that financial space for financial speculation.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.000
And that's what the G20 is, a treaty-based institution.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.000
Now there's a problem there,

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000
and we'll come back to it in a minute,

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.000
which is that if you bring the most powerful together

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.000
to make the rules in treaty-based institutions,

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.000
to fill that governance space,

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.000
then what happens to the weak who are left out?

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.000
And that's a big problem,

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000
and we'll return to it in just a second.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000
So there's my first message,

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.000
that if you are to pass through these turbulent times

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.000
more or less turbulently,

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.000
then our success in doing that

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.000
will in large measure depend on our capacity

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.000
to bring sensible governance

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.000
to the global space.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:28.000
And watch that beginning to happen.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000
My second point is,

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000
and I know I don't have to talk to an audience like this

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.000
about such a thing,

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:37.000
but power is not just shifting vertically,

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.000
it's also shifting horizontally.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.000
You might argue that the story, the history of civilizations,

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:45.000
has been civilizations gathered around seas --

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.000
with the first ones around the Mediterranean,

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:52.000
the more recent ones in the ascendents of Western power around the Atlantic.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000
Well it seems to me

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.000
that we're now seeing a fundamental shift of power, broadly speaking,

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:00.000
away from nations gathered around the Atlantic [seaboard]

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000
to the nations gathered around the Pacific rim.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000
Now that begins with economic power,

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.000
but that's the way it always begins.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:09.000
You already begin to see the development of foreign policies,

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.000
the augmentation of military budgets

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:14.000
occurring in the other growing powers in the world.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.000
I think actually

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.000
this is not so much a shift from the West to the East;

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.000
something different is happening.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.000
My guess is, for what it's worth,

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.000
is that the United States will remain

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000
the most powerful nation on earth

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:29.000
for the next 10 years, 15,

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:32.000
but the context in which she holds her power

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:35.000
has now radically altered; it has radically changed.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.000
We are coming out of 50 years,

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.000
most unusual years, of history

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.000
in which we have had a totally mono-polar world,

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.000
in which every compass needle

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000
for or against

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:49.000
has to be referenced by its position to Washington --

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:53.000
a world bestrode by a single colossus.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.000
But that's not a usual case in history.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.000
In fact, what's now emerging

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.000
is the much more normal case of history.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.000
You're beginning to see the emergence

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.000
of a multi-polar world.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.000
Up until now,

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:08.000
the United States has been the dominant feature of our world.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.000
They will remain the most powerful nation,

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.000
but they will be the most powerful nation

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.000
in an increasingly multi-polar world.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:17.000
And you begin to see the alternative centers of power building up --

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.000
in China, of course,

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:22.000
though my own guess is that China's ascent to greatness is not smooth.

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.000
It's going to be quite grumpy

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.000
as China begins to democratize her society

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.000
after liberalizing her economy.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:31.000
But that's a subject of a different discussion.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.000
You see India, you see Brazil.

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.000
You see increasingly

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:38.000
that the world now looks actually, for us Europeans,

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:41.000
much more like Europe in the 19th century.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.000
Europe in the 19th century:

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.000
a great British foreign secretary, Lord Canning,

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:48.000
used to describe it as the "European concert of powers."

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.000
There was a balance, a five-sided balance.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:53.000
Britain always played to the balance.

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.000
If Paris got together with Berlin,

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:58.000
Britain got together with Vienna and Rome to provide a counterbalance.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.000
Now notice,

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.000
in a period which is dominated by a mono-polar world,

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.000
you have fixed alliances --

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.000
NATO, the Warsaw Pact.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.000
A fixed polarity of power

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.000
means fixed alliances.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.000
But a multiple polarity of power

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.000
means shifting and changing alliances.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.000
And that's the world we're coming into,

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.000
in which we will increasingly see

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.000
that our alliances are not fixed.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.000
Canning, the great British foreign secretary once said,

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.000
"Britain has a common interest,

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.000
but no common allies."

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.000
And we will see increasingly

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.000
that even we in the West

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.000
will reach out, have to reach out,

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.000
beyond the cozy circle of the Atlantic powers

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.000
to make alliances with others

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:39.000
if we want to get things done in the world.

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.000
Note, that when we went into Libya,

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.000
it was not good enough for the West to do it alone;

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.000
we had to bring others in.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:48.000
We had to bring, in this case, the Arab League in.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:51.000
My guess is Iraq and Afghanistan are the last times

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:53.000
when the West has tried to do it themselves,

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.000
and we haven't succeeded.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.000
My guess

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:00.000
is that we're reaching the beginning of the end of 400 years --

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:03.000
I say 400 years because it's the end of the Ottoman Empire --

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:05.000
of the hegemony of Western power,

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:08.000
Western institutions and Western values.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:12.000
You know, up until now, if the West got its act together,

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.000
it could propose and dispose

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.000
in every corner of the world.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.000
But that's no longer true.

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.000
Take the last financial crisis

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.000
after the Second World War.

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.000
The West got together --

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:27.000
the Bretton Woods Institution, World Bank, International Monetary Fund --

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.000
the problem solved.

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.000
Now we have to call in others.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:33.000
Now we have to create the G20.

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.000
Now we have to reach beyond the cozy circle

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:37.000
of our Western friends.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.000
Let me make a prediction for you,

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:42.000
which is probably even more startling.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:45.000
I suspect we are now reaching the end

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:47.000
of 400 years

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.000
when Western power was enough.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.000
People say to me, "The Chinese, of course,

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.000
they'll never get themselves involved

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.000
in peace-making, multilateral peace-making around the world."

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:57.000
Oh yes? Why not?

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.000
How many Chinese troops

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.000
are serving under the blue beret, serving under the blue flag,

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.000
serving under the U.N. command in the world today?

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:05.000
3,700.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:08.000
How many Americans? 11.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.000
What is the largest naval contingent

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:13.000
tackling the issue of Somali pirates?

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:15.000
The Chinese naval contingent.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:17.000
Of course they are, they are a mercantilist nation.

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:19.000
They want to keep the sea lanes open.

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:22.000
Increasingly, we are going to have to do business

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:25.000
with people with whom we do not share values,

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:28.000
but with whom, for the moment, we share common interests.

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.000
It's a whole new different way

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:33.000
of looking at the world that is now emerging.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:35.000
And here's the third factor,

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:38.000
which is totally different.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.000
Today in our modern world,

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:42.000
because of the Internet,

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:45.000
because of the kinds of things people have been talking about here,

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:49.000
everything is connected to everything.

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:51.000
We are now interdependent.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.000
We are now interlocked,

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.000
as nations, as individuals,

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.000
in a way which has never been the case before,

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:00.000
never been the case before.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.000
The interrelationship of nations,

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:04.000
well it's always existed.

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:07.000
Diplomacy is about managing the interrelationship of nations.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:09.000
But now we are intimately locked together.

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:11.000
You get swine flu in Mexico,

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:13.000
it's a problem for Charles de Gaulle Airport

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:15.000
24 hours later.

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:18.000
Lehman Brothers goes down, the whole lot collapses.

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:21.000
There are fires in the steppes of Russia,

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.000
food riots in Africa.

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:27.000
We are all now deeply, deeply, deeply interconnected.

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:30.000
And what that means

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:34.000
is the idea of a nation state acting alone,

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:36.000
not connected with others,

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.000
not working with others,

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.000
is no longer a viable proposition.

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:43.000
Because the actions of a nation state

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:45.000
are neither confined to itself,

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.000
nor is it sufficient for the nation state itself

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:49.000
to control its own territory,

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:52.000
because the effects outside the nation state

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:55.000
are now beginning to affect what happens inside them.

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.000
I was a young soldier

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:01.000
in the last of the small empire wars of Britain.

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:03.000
At that time, the defense of my country

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:06.000
was about one thing and one thing only:

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:09.000
how strong was our army, how strong was our air force,

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:11.000
how strong was our navy and how strong were our allies.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:13.000
That was when the enemy was outside the walls.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:16.000
Now the enemy is inside the walls.

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.000
Now if I want to talk about the defense of my country,

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:20.000
I have to speak to the Minister of Health

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:23.000
because pandemic disease is a threat to my security,

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:25.000
I have to speak to the Minister of Agriculture

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:27.000
because food security is a threat to my security,

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:31.000
I have to speak to the Minister of Industry

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:34.000
because the fragility of our hi-tech infrastructure

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:36.000
is now a point of attack for our enemies --

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:38.000
as we see from cyber warfare --

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:41.000
I have to speak to the Minister of Home Affairs

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:43.000
because who has entered my country,

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:46.000
who lives in that terraced house in that inner city

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.000
has a direct effect on what happens in my country --

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:52.000
as we in London saw in the 7/7 bombings.

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:55.000
It's no longer the case that the security of a country

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:58.000
is simply a matter for its soldiers and its ministry of defense.

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:01.000
It's its capacity to lock together its institutions.

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:04.000
And this tells you something very important.

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:06.000
It tells you that, in fact,

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:09.000
our governments, vertically constructed,

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:11.000
constructed on the economic model of the Industrial Revolution --

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:14.000
vertical hierarchy, specialization of tasks,

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:16.000
command structures --

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:18.000
have got the wrong structures completely.

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.000
You in business know

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:22.000
that the paradigm structure of our time, ladies and gentlemen,

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:24.000
is the network.

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:26.000
It's your capacity to network that matters,

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:29.000
both within your governments and externally.

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:31.000
So here is Ashdown's third law.

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:34.000
By the way, don't ask me about Ashdown's first law and second law

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:36.000
because I haven't invented those yet;

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:38.000
it always sounds better if there's a third law, doesn't it?

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:41.000
Ashdown's third law is that in the modern age,

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:43.000
where everything is connected to everything,

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:46.000
the most important thing about what you can do

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:48.000
is what you can do with others.

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:50.000
The most important bit about your structure --

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:52.000
whether you're a government, whether you're an army regiment,

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:54.000
whether you're a business --

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:56.000
is your docking points, your interconnectors,

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:58.000
your capacity to network with others.

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:00.000
You understand that in industry;

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:03.000
governments don't.

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:05.000
But now one final thing.

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:08.000
If it is the case, ladies and gentlemen -- and it is --

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:10.000
that we are now locked together

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:12.000
in a way that has never been quite the same before,

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:16.000
then it's also the case that we share a destiny with each other.

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:19.000
Suddenly and for the very first time,

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:22.000
collective defense, the thing that has dominated us

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:24.000
as the concept of securing our nations,

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:26.000
is no longer enough.

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:28.000
It used to be the case

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:30.000
that if my tribe was more powerful than their tribe, I was safe;

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:33.000
if my country was more powerful than their country, I was safe;

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:36.000
my alliance, like NATO, was more powerful than their alliance, I was safe.

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:38.000
It is no longer the case.

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:41.000
The advent of the interconnectedness

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:43.000
and of the weapons of mass destruction

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:45.000
means that, increasingly,

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:47.000
I share a destiny with my enemy.

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:49.000
When I was a diplomat

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:52.000
negotiating the disarmament treaties with the Soviet Union

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:54.000
in Geneva in the 1970s,

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:56.000
we succeeded because we understood

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:58.000
we shared a destiny with them.

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:01.000
Collective security is not enough.

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:03.000
Peace has come to Northern Ireland

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:06.000
because both sides realized that the zero-sum game couldn't work.

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:09.000
They shared a destiny with their enemies.

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:11.000
One of the great barriers to peace in the Middle East

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:14.000
is that both sides, both Israel and, I think, the Palestinians,

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:16.000
do not understand

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:19.000
that they share a collective destiny.

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:21.000
And so suddenly, ladies and gentlemen,

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:23.000
what has been the proposition

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:26.000
of visionaries and poets down the ages

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:28.000
becomes something we have to take seriously

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:30.000
as a matter of public policy.

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:33.000
I started with a poem, I'll end with one.

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:36.000
The great poem of John Donne's.

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:40.000
"Send not for whom the bell tolls."

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:42.000
The poem is called "No Man is an Island."

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:44.000
And it goes:

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:47.000
"Every man's death affected me,

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:49.000
for I am involved in mankind,

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:51.000
send not to ask

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:53.000
for whom the bell tolls,

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:55.000
it tolls for thee."

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:58.000
For John Donne, a recommendation of morality.

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:00.000
For us, I think,

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:03.000
part of the equation for our survival.

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:05.000
Thank you very much.

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:08.000
(Applause)
