00:00:00.214 --> 00:00:04.370
There's currently over a thousand
TED Talks on the TED website.

00:00:04.394 --> 00:00:09.390
And I guess many of you here
think that this is quite fantastic,

00:00:09.414 --> 00:00:11.288
except for me, I don't agree with this.

00:00:11.312 --> 00:00:12.897
I think we have a situation here.

00:00:12.921 --> 00:00:16.288
Because if you think about it,
1,000 TED Talks,

00:00:16.396 --> 00:00:19.829
that's over 1,000 ideas worth spreading.

00:00:19.853 --> 00:00:23.442
How on earth are you going
to spread a thousand ideas?

00:00:23.466 --> 00:00:26.334
Even if you just try
to get all of those ideas into your head

00:00:26.358 --> 00:00:28.379
by watching all those thousand TED videos,

00:00:28.403 --> 00:00:32.142
it would actually currently take you
over 250 hours to do so.

00:00:32.563 --> 00:00:35.127
And I did a little calculation of this.

00:00:35.151 --> 00:00:39.313
The damage to the economy for each one
who does this is around $15,000.

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:43.213
So having seen this danger to the economy,

00:00:43.237 --> 00:00:46.340
I thought, we need to find
a solution to this problem.

00:00:46.364 --> 00:00:48.122
Here's my approach to it all.

00:00:48.146 --> 00:00:51.352
If you look at the current situation,
you have a thousand TED Talks.

00:00:51.376 --> 00:00:56.251
Each of those TED Talks has
an average length of about 2,300 words.

00:00:56.275 --> 00:01:00.975
Now take this together, and you end up
with 2.3 million words of TED Talks,

00:01:00.999 --> 00:01:03.685
which is about
three Bibles-worth of content.

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:04.710
(Laughter)

00:01:04.734 --> 00:01:09.190
The obvious question here is,
does a TED Talk really need 2,300 words?

00:01:09.214 --> 00:01:10.679
Isn't there something shorter?

00:01:10.703 --> 00:01:12.783
I mean, if you have
an idea worth spreading,

00:01:12.807 --> 00:01:16.265
surely you can put it
into something shorter than 2,300 words.

00:01:16.289 --> 00:01:18.983
The only question is,
how short can you get?

00:01:19.007 --> 00:01:22.295
What's the minimum amount of words
you would need to do a TED Talk?

00:01:22.945 --> 00:01:24.667
While I was pondering this question,

00:01:24.691 --> 00:01:27.888
I came across this urban legend
about Ernest Hemingway,

00:01:27.912 --> 00:01:30.984
who allegedly said
that these six words here:

00:01:31.008 --> 00:01:33.860
"For sale: baby shoes, never worn,"

00:01:33.884 --> 00:01:36.217
were the best novel he had ever written.

00:01:36.622 --> 00:01:39.248
And I also encountered a project
called Six-Word Memoirs

00:01:39.272 --> 00:01:41.392
where people were asked,
take your whole life

00:01:41.416 --> 00:01:44.152
and please sum this up
into six words, such as these here:

00:01:44.176 --> 00:01:46.187
"Found true love, married someone else."

00:01:46.211 --> 00:01:48.586
Or "Living in existential
vacuum; it sucks."

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:49.976
I actually like that one.

00:01:50.692 --> 00:01:53.088
So if a novel can be put into six words

00:01:53.112 --> 00:01:56.590
and a whole memoir can be put
into six words,

00:01:56.718 --> 00:01:59.639
you don't need more than six
words for a TED Talk.

00:01:59.663 --> 00:02:02.881
We could have been done by lunch here.

00:02:02.905 --> 00:02:04.388
(Laughter)

00:02:04.412 --> 00:02:06.622
And if you did this
for all thousand TED Talks,

00:02:06.646 --> 00:02:09.974
you would get from 2.3 million
words down to 6,000.

00:02:09.998 --> 00:02:11.871
So I thought this was quite worthwhile.

00:02:11.895 --> 00:02:13.653
So I started asking all my friends,

00:02:13.677 --> 00:02:16.675
please take your favorite TED Talk
and put that into six words.

00:02:16.699 --> 00:02:18.943
So here are some of the results
that I received.

00:02:18.967 --> 00:02:20.315
I think they're quite nice.

00:02:20.339 --> 00:02:23.439
For example, Dan Pink's talk
on motivation, which was pretty good,

00:02:23.463 --> 00:02:26.569
if you haven't seen it:
"Drop carrot. Drop stick. Bring meaning."

00:02:26.593 --> 00:02:29.465
It's what he's basically talking about
in those 18,5 minutes.

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:31.783
Or some even included references
to the speakers,

00:02:31.807 --> 00:02:35.011
such as Nathan Myhrvold's speaking style,
or the one of Tim Ferriss,

00:02:35.035 --> 00:02:37.444
which might be considered
a bit strenuous at times.

00:02:37.468 --> 00:02:40.189
The challenge here is,
if I try to systematically do this,

00:02:40.213 --> 00:02:42.538
I would probably end up
with a lot of summaries,

00:02:42.562 --> 00:02:44.334
but not with many friends in the end.

00:02:44.358 --> 00:02:47.853
So I had to find a different method,
preferably involving total strangers.

00:02:47.877 --> 00:02:51.213
And luckily, there's a website for that,
called Mechanical Turk,

00:02:51.237 --> 00:02:53.405
which is a website
where you can post tasks

00:02:53.429 --> 00:02:55.119
that you don't want to do yourself,

00:02:55.143 --> 00:02:58.148
such as "Please summarize this text
for me in six words."

00:02:58.172 --> 00:03:01.007
And I didn't allow any low-cost
countries to work on this,

00:03:01.031 --> 00:03:04.731
but I found out I could get
a six-word summary for just 10 cents,

00:03:04.755 --> 00:03:07.001
which I think is a pretty good price.

00:03:07.025 --> 00:03:08.725
Even then, unfortunately,

00:03:08.749 --> 00:03:11.594
it's not possible to summarize
each TED Talk individually.

00:03:11.618 --> 00:03:14.372
Because if you do the math,
you have a thousand TED Talks,

00:03:14.396 --> 00:03:15.562
you pay 10 cents each;

00:03:15.586 --> 00:03:18.531
you have to do more than one summary
for each of those talks,

00:03:18.555 --> 00:03:21.342
because some of them will probably
be, or are, really bad.

00:03:21.366 --> 00:03:24.176
So I would end up paying
hundreds of dollars.

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:25.976
So I thought of a different way,

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.374
by thinking, well, the talks
revolve around certain themes.

00:03:29.398 --> 00:03:34.059
So what if I don't let people summarize
individual TED Talks to six words,

00:03:34.083 --> 00:03:36.099
but give them 10 TED Talks
at the same time

00:03:36.123 --> 00:03:38.744
and say, "Please do a six-word
summary for that one."

00:03:38.768 --> 00:03:40.931
I would cut my costs by 90 percent.

00:03:40.955 --> 00:03:43.485
So for $60,

00:03:43.509 --> 00:03:47.500
I could summarize a thousand TED Talks
into just 600 summaries,

00:03:47.524 --> 00:03:49.522
which would actually be quite nice.

00:03:49.546 --> 00:03:51.839
Some of you might actually
right now be thinking,

00:03:51.863 --> 00:03:55.361
it's downright crazy to have 10 TED Talks
summarized into just six words.

00:03:55.385 --> 00:03:56.665
But it's actually not,

00:03:56.689 --> 00:03:59.818
because there's an example
by statistics professor Hans Rosling.

00:03:59.842 --> 00:04:02.428
I guess many of you have seen
one or more of his talks.

00:04:02.452 --> 00:04:03.788
He's got eight talks online,

00:04:03.812 --> 00:04:06.528
and those can basically be summed up
into just four words,

00:04:06.552 --> 00:04:10.795
because that's all he's basically
showing us, our intuition is really bad.

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:12.546
He always proves us wrong.

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:15.133
So people on the Internet,
some didn't do so well.

00:04:15.157 --> 00:04:18.550
And when I asked them to summarize
the 10 TED Talks at the same time,

00:04:18.574 --> 00:04:20.054
some took the easy route out.

00:04:20.078 --> 00:04:22.399
They just had some general comment.

00:04:22.513 --> 00:04:25.549
There were others --
and I found this quite cheeky --

00:04:25.573 --> 00:04:27.983
They used their six words
to talk back to me

00:04:28.007 --> 00:04:30.316
and ask me if I'd been too much
on Google lately.

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:31.499
(Laughter)

00:04:31.523 --> 00:04:34.616
And finally also, I never understood this,

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:37.774
some people really came up
with their own version of the truth.

00:04:37.798 --> 00:04:40.607
I don't know any TED Talk
that contains this.

00:04:40.631 --> 00:04:42.181
But, oh well.

00:04:42.205 --> 00:04:44.541
In the end, however,
and this is really amazing,

00:04:44.565 --> 00:04:47.405
for each of those 10 TED Talk
clusters that I submitted,

00:04:47.429 --> 00:04:49.391
I actually received meaningful summaries.

00:04:49.415 --> 00:04:50.858
Here are some of my favorites.

00:04:50.882 --> 00:04:53.162
For example, for the TED Talks about food,

00:04:53.186 --> 00:04:56.645
someone summed this up into: "Food shaping
body, brains and environment,"

00:04:56.669 --> 00:04:58.057
which I think is pretty good.

00:04:58.081 --> 00:05:01.371
Or happiness: "Striving toward happiness =
moving toward unhappiness."

00:05:01.395 --> 00:05:02.548
So here I was.

00:05:02.572 --> 00:05:04.582
I had started out
with a thousand TED Talks

00:05:04.606 --> 00:05:07.331
and I had 600 six-word
summaries for those.

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:10.033
Actually, it sounded nice
in the beginning,

00:05:10.057 --> 00:05:13.455
but when you look at 600 summaries,
it's quite a lot, it's a huge list.

00:05:13.479 --> 00:05:14.494
(Laughter)

00:05:14.518 --> 00:05:17.576
So I thought, I probably have
to take this one step further here

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:21.228
and create summaries of the summaries,
and this is exactly what I did.

00:05:21.252 --> 00:05:24.522
So I took the 600 summaries that I had,
put them into nine groups

00:05:24.546 --> 00:05:28.434
according to the ratings that the talks
had originally received on TED.com

00:05:28.458 --> 00:05:31.343
and asked people to do summaries of those.

00:05:31.779 --> 00:05:33.751
Again, there were some misunderstandings.

00:05:33.775 --> 00:05:36.740
For example, when I had a cluster
of all the "Beautiful" talks,

00:05:36.764 --> 00:05:39.983
someone thought I was just trying
to find the ultimate pick-up line.

00:05:40.007 --> 00:05:42.184
But in the end, amazingly,

00:05:42.208 --> 00:05:43.789
again, people were able to do it.

00:05:43.813 --> 00:05:45.867
For example, all the courageous TED Talks:

00:05:45.891 --> 00:05:48.330
"People dying" or "People
suffering" was also one,

00:05:48.354 --> 00:05:49.751
"with easy solutions around."

00:05:49.775 --> 00:05:52.260
Or the recipe for the ultimate
jaw-dropping TED Talk:

00:05:52.284 --> 00:05:54.815
"Flickr photos of intergalactic
classical composer."

00:05:54.839 --> 00:05:57.197
I mean that's the essence of it all.

00:05:57.712 --> 00:06:02.684
Now I had my nine groups, but, I mean,
it's already quite a reduction.

00:06:02.708 --> 00:06:06.143
But of course, once you are that far,
you're not really satisfied.

00:06:06.167 --> 00:06:08.992
I wanted to go all the way,
all the way down the distillery,

00:06:09.016 --> 00:06:10.906
starting out with a thousand TED Talks.

00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:14.294
I wanted to have a thousand TED Talks
summarized into just six words --

00:06:14.318 --> 00:06:17.796
which would be a 99.9997 percent
reduction in content.

00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:21.457
And I would only pay $99.50 --

00:06:21.481 --> 00:06:23.632
so stay even below $100 for it.

00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:26.303
So I had 50 overall summaries done.

00:06:26.327 --> 00:06:27.735
This time I paid 25 cents

00:06:27.759 --> 00:06:29.863
because I thought the task
was a bit harder.

00:06:29.887 --> 00:06:33.315
And unfortunately,
when I first received the answers --

00:06:33.339 --> 00:06:36.557
and here, you'll see six of the answers --
I was a bit disappointed.

00:06:36.581 --> 00:06:39.805
Because I think you'll agree,
they all summarize some aspect of TED,

00:06:39.829 --> 00:06:41.753
but to me, they felt a bit bland,

00:06:41.777 --> 00:06:45.046
or they just had
a certain aspect of TED in them.

00:06:45.070 --> 00:06:46.834
So I was almost ready to give up

00:06:46.858 --> 00:06:49.957
when one night, I played around
with these sentences

00:06:49.981 --> 00:06:53.904
and found out that there's actually
a beautiful solution in here.

00:06:53.928 --> 00:06:56.292
So here it is,

00:06:56.316 --> 00:07:00.298
a crowd-sourced, six-word
summary of a thousand TED Talks

00:07:00.322 --> 00:07:02.681
at the value of $99.50:

00:07:03.530 --> 00:07:06.172
"Why the worry? I'd rather wonder."

00:07:06.196 --> 00:07:07.459
Thank you very much.

00:07:07.483 --> 00:07:13.468
(Applause)
