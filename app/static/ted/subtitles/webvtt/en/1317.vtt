WEBVTT

00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:01.856
I believe

00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:06.410
that we can both unravel
the mysteries of the universe

00:00:06.434 --> 00:00:09.448
and save human lives at the same time

00:00:09.472 --> 00:00:12.141
through interdisciplinary research.

00:00:12.165 --> 00:00:16.697
And I'm going to share with you today
just one story, my story,

00:00:16.721 --> 00:00:18.629
that has crossed these paths.

00:00:18.653 --> 00:00:22.082
We start the in supernova
remnant Cassiopeia A.

00:00:22.106 --> 00:00:25.807
It's one of the youngest ones
in our galaxy, about 330 years old.

00:00:25.831 --> 00:00:28.297
An astronomy colleague
approached me one day,

00:00:28.321 --> 00:00:31.644
and she had over eight years
of magnificent data,

00:00:31.668 --> 00:00:34.959
just trying to understand
the 3-D structure of this nebula,

00:00:34.983 --> 00:00:36.497
the supernova remnant.

00:00:36.521 --> 00:00:38.294
But she had no way to look at it.

00:00:39.078 --> 00:00:43.677
So I looked at the data with her
and said, "I think I can help you."

00:00:43.701 --> 00:00:45.726
And although -- and this is all real data

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.193
you're seeing on the screen above me --

00:00:48.217 --> 00:00:50.282
this is the Hollywood rendering version,

00:00:50.306 --> 00:00:54.754
but the rough draft I made with her
looks something more like this.

00:00:54.778 --> 00:00:58.635
And she was able to make novel discoveries
about how supernovas explode

00:00:58.659 --> 00:01:01.216
and how shells explode within it,

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:05.129
using a piece of software developed
at Brigham and Women's Hospital

00:01:05.153 --> 00:01:06.462
here in Boston,

00:01:06.486 --> 00:01:08.308
called 3D Slicer.

00:01:08.332 --> 00:01:12.546
It was originally developed
for looking at patients' brain scans,

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.024
doing surgical planning

00:01:14.048 --> 00:01:16.678
and doing 3-D renderings of anatomy.

00:01:16.702 --> 00:01:21.428
Who knew our solution was lurking
just across the river?

00:01:21.452 --> 00:01:23.955
Now, people don't believe me

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:26.846
when I tell them that astronomy
and medical imaging --

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:28.768
these two seemingly different fields --

00:01:28.792 --> 00:01:29.947
are really similar.

00:01:29.971 --> 00:01:33.245
So we're going to play a little game
I like to call "Which is which?"

00:01:33.269 --> 00:01:35.959
I play this with new doctors
and astronomers I work with.

00:01:35.983 --> 00:01:38.212
I'm going to show you
two images on the screen.

00:01:38.236 --> 00:01:41.510
One of them is biomedical
and one of them is astronomical,

00:01:41.534 --> 00:01:44.857
and you have to pick them
correctly in your head.

00:01:44.881 --> 00:01:46.498
So here is the first set.

00:01:46.522 --> 00:01:50.171
And again, one of these is biomedical
and one is astronomical.

00:01:50.195 --> 00:01:53.842
I'll give you a second
to make your little vote mentally.

00:01:57.533 --> 00:02:00.860
So it turns out the one on the left
is some of the raw data

00:02:00.884 --> 00:02:03.221
of the supernova remnant
we were just looking at,

00:02:03.245 --> 00:02:06.108
and on the right, we have
an angiogram of a patient's heart

00:02:06.132 --> 00:02:07.297
and coronary arteries.

00:02:07.321 --> 00:02:08.997
OK, we're going to try another one.

00:02:09.021 --> 00:02:12.351
Now, this one is much closer
to my daily bread and butter.

00:02:12.375 --> 00:02:14.673
Tell me which is which.

00:02:14.697 --> 00:02:17.324
And one of these is literally
millimeters across,

00:02:17.348 --> 00:02:19.914
and the other is billions of miles.

00:02:25.881 --> 00:02:29.427
So, it turns out the one on the left
is a confocal microscopy image

00:02:29.451 --> 00:02:30.607
of a human cornea,

00:02:30.631 --> 00:02:33.705
and on the right, we have
a radio telescope image

00:02:33.729 --> 00:02:36.349
of the star-forming region NGC-1333.

00:02:36.373 --> 00:02:39.106
Now, aside from the fact
that these images look similar

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:42.053
and that doctors trying to find
a tumor in a patient's brain

00:02:42.077 --> 00:02:43.823
or a young star forming is similar,

00:02:43.847 --> 00:02:46.590
the way the data comes
from the machine or the telescope

00:02:46.614 --> 00:02:48.216
is remarkably similar.

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:50.720
Here's an MRI scanner.

00:02:50.744 --> 00:02:53.731
And if you've never seen
the raw data of a patient's brain,

00:02:53.755 --> 00:02:55.085
this is what it looks like.

00:02:55.109 --> 00:02:57.636
When the MRI scanner
is acquiring the data,

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:58.945
it goes in slices.

00:02:58.969 --> 00:03:01.715
So you can see
the patient's nose, their eyes;

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:04.429
it kind of progresses
towards the middle of the head;

00:03:04.453 --> 00:03:06.542
you can start to see the cortex,

00:03:06.566 --> 00:03:09.601
and it steps through
to the back of the brain.

00:03:09.625 --> 00:03:10.942
Now, believe it or not,

00:03:10.966 --> 00:03:15.585
telescopes, and particularly radio
telescopes, operate in a similar manner.

00:03:15.609 --> 00:03:18.677
If we were to look at the raw data
from these telescopes ...

00:03:18.701 --> 00:03:21.956
We're going to look
at a nebula called M16.

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:25.208
We start with this radio telescope
at the front of the nebula,

00:03:25.232 --> 00:03:27.556
stepping back towards
the middle of the nebula,

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:29.923
just like the middle
of the patient's brain --

00:03:29.947 --> 00:03:32.997
those bright regions
are where young stars are forming --

00:03:33.021 --> 00:03:34.889
all the way to the back of the nebula,

00:03:34.913 --> 00:03:37.442
just like the back of the patient's head.

00:03:37.466 --> 00:03:41.659
Now, although the doctors
are able to then take this data

00:03:41.683 --> 00:03:44.371
and look at it in 3-D
and do surgical planning,

00:03:44.395 --> 00:03:46.027
this is cutting-edge,

00:03:46.051 --> 00:03:48.435
just about as good as you get
with any astronomer,

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:53.515
and this is what they have to look at
to understand the 3-D structure

00:03:53.539 --> 00:03:56.513
and velocity's momentum in our universe.

00:03:56.537 --> 00:03:58.222
But we can do better.

00:03:58.246 --> 00:04:01.591
So, you might recognize
this nebula more like this:

00:04:01.615 --> 00:04:05.742
the famous Hubble image of the Pillars
of Creation or the Eagle Nebula.

00:04:05.766 --> 00:04:08.799
And, I'm going to fade this
out onto a radio image,

00:04:08.823 --> 00:04:11.007
it's a false color in the background,

00:04:11.031 --> 00:04:13.751
and fade away the Hubble image
you're used to.

00:04:14.329 --> 00:04:17.945
But we don't need to just look
at this in 3-D, we can look at it in 2-D,

00:04:17.969 --> 00:04:22.003
and here I'm using a radiology
tool kit called OsiriX.

00:04:22.027 --> 00:04:24.399
When I showed this
to astronomer Marc Pound,

00:04:24.423 --> 00:04:25.748
whose data this is,

00:04:25.772 --> 00:04:29.131
he was amazed, because he had
been trying so hard

00:04:29.155 --> 00:04:31.972
to study the impact
of a young group of stars.

00:04:31.996 --> 00:04:33.179
And he had this theory

00:04:33.203 --> 00:04:36.347
that there's this wind crashing
and tossing the pillars over,

00:04:36.371 --> 00:04:40.004
and it took him months to prove this
with conventional visualization.

00:04:40.028 --> 00:04:43.656
But in one shot, you can
see the shock wave of wind

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:46.645
blasting through across
to the left-hand side of the screen.

00:04:47.388 --> 00:04:50.484
Now, I don't think myself
or any of my collaborators

00:04:50.508 --> 00:04:53.413
would've anticipated
how far this has gone,

00:04:53.437 --> 00:04:55.936
and by sharing the medical
technology with astronomy

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:57.314
and astronomy with medical,

00:04:57.338 --> 00:05:00.231
we've been able to find
new stars and supernova remnants,

00:05:00.255 --> 00:05:03.458
and revolutionize how you do
heart diagnostics

00:05:03.482 --> 00:05:08.104
and look at data for different patients
and organize it and data-mine it.

00:05:08.128 --> 00:05:10.741
I don't have time to show you
all these great projects,

00:05:10.765 --> 00:05:12.210
but I'll show you one of them.

00:05:12.234 --> 00:05:14.414
This is a collaboration
I've been working on,

00:05:14.438 --> 00:05:16.660
called The Multiscale
Hemodynamics Project.

00:05:16.684 --> 00:05:19.397
I'm working with doctors
at Brigham and Women's Hospital.

00:05:19.421 --> 00:05:23.643
Now, what this represents is a novel way
of doing heart disease diagnostics.

00:05:23.667 --> 00:05:27.720
And instead of the conventional
invasive angiography,

00:05:27.744 --> 00:05:29.519
this is just a CT scan.

00:05:29.543 --> 00:05:31.635
What you see here
are the coronary arteries.

00:05:31.659 --> 00:05:34.903
So you have your heart, and the arteries
wrap around the outside.

00:05:34.927 --> 00:05:37.658
These are the arteries
you worry about getting blocked

00:05:37.682 --> 00:05:39.100
and giving you a heart attack

00:05:39.124 --> 00:05:40.278
and killing you.

00:05:40.302 --> 00:05:42.575
So it's really important
that we look at them.

00:05:42.599 --> 00:05:45.540
Now, this is a CT scan of a patient

00:05:45.564 --> 00:05:49.719
with a blood-flow simulation --
that's the coloring up there.

00:05:49.743 --> 00:05:54.615
That simulation was originally developed
for studying the structure of DNA,

00:05:54.639 --> 00:05:58.245
and then the visualization was done
with a tool kit called VisIt,

00:05:58.269 --> 00:06:01.130
originally developed
for physics simulations.

00:06:01.154 --> 00:06:02.689
Interdisciplinary.

00:06:02.713 --> 00:06:06.460
My assignment was to try and come up with
a new way of looking at this

00:06:06.484 --> 00:06:09.169
to make it optimal
for the doctors and hospital:

00:06:09.193 --> 00:06:12.757
How can we make it the most efficient
for them for a diagnosis?

00:06:12.781 --> 00:06:14.693
And I came up with this image.

00:06:15.038 --> 00:06:16.197
It's 2-D;

00:06:16.221 --> 00:06:20.320
I took the whole artery and collapsed
everything into a 2-D plane.

00:06:20.783 --> 00:06:22.308
I got some very quizzical looks

00:06:22.332 --> 00:06:24.497
when I showed this
to the doctors originally.

00:06:24.521 --> 00:06:27.912
But I was inspired to do this
representation from my astronomy work,

00:06:27.936 --> 00:06:31.213
where we've been using these
tree diagrams along the bottom

00:06:31.237 --> 00:06:33.353
to understand the structure of nebulae.

00:06:33.377 --> 00:06:35.050
Well, we were inspired in that work

00:06:35.074 --> 00:06:37.439
from the bioinformatics
and genome community,

00:06:37.463 --> 00:06:41.098
where they use these tree diagrams
to understand their gene expression data.

00:06:41.122 --> 00:06:43.960
They were inspired
by the evolutionary biologists,

00:06:43.984 --> 00:06:47.878
who use these tree diagrams to understand
how species evolve and are related,

00:06:47.902 --> 00:06:50.940
the first of which was drawn
by Sir Charles Darwin.

00:06:50.964 --> 00:06:53.799
Here's an example
from his "Origin of the Species."

00:06:53.823 --> 00:06:58.198
So, straight from Darwin,
through biology, physics, astronomy,

00:06:58.222 --> 00:06:59.564
back to medical imaging.

00:07:00.036 --> 00:07:01.236
Interdisciplinary.

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:05.732
One may say, "Well, is this
2-D representation better?"

00:07:05.756 --> 00:07:09.669
I did a study at Harvard Medical School
to answer just that question.

00:07:09.693 --> 00:07:14.380
And it turns out, if you present
the image on the left to a doctor,

00:07:14.404 --> 00:07:18.825
on average, they find about 39%
of the high-risk regions

00:07:18.849 --> 00:07:21.750
that could explode or block
your heart and kill you.

00:07:21.774 --> 00:07:23.957
On the right, we can do a little better,

00:07:23.981 --> 00:07:28.371
and they're able to find 62% of these
high-risk, dangerous regions.

00:07:28.395 --> 00:07:30.813
But we can do even better,

00:07:30.837 --> 00:07:33.926
simply by changing the colors.

00:07:33.950 --> 00:07:37.571
The rainbow color map is a sin most
doctors and astronomers and physicists

00:07:37.595 --> 00:07:40.161
are guilty of using. (Laughs)

00:07:40.185 --> 00:07:44.784
And it doesn't focus the best
qualities of your visual system.

00:07:44.808 --> 00:07:48.422
The human system can see
brightness variation, contrast ...

00:07:48.446 --> 00:07:51.498
not really good at that whole
"green-yellow-blue" thing.

00:07:51.522 --> 00:07:53.979
But now, if you look in the shades of red

00:07:54.003 --> 00:07:57.160
and highlight the regions
that are most diseased with dark red,

00:07:57.184 --> 00:08:00.912
now doctors can find 91%
of the high-risk regions,

00:08:00.936 --> 00:08:02.663
simply by changing the colors.

00:08:02.687 --> 00:08:05.966
(Applause)

00:08:05.990 --> 00:08:09.033
And I would have never known
the importance of color

00:08:09.057 --> 00:08:12.374
if it was not for my computer science
and visualization collaborators

00:08:12.398 --> 00:08:13.553
showing this to me.

00:08:13.577 --> 00:08:15.709
So again: interdisciplinary collaboration.

00:08:15.733 --> 00:08:18.413
How do you even get
a collaboration like this?

00:08:18.437 --> 00:08:20.487
In the case of astronomical medicine,

00:08:20.511 --> 00:08:23.598
it started with a Harvard Astronomy
professor, Alyssa Goodman,

00:08:23.622 --> 00:08:28.035
serendipitously meeting a computer
scientist and imaging specialist

00:08:28.059 --> 00:08:29.741
from Brigham and Woman’s Hospital,

00:08:29.765 --> 00:08:31.904
and their recruitment
of a very adventurous,

00:08:31.928 --> 00:08:33.866
open-minded, young student. (Laughter)

00:08:33.890 --> 00:08:37.897
And from there, it has exploded:
we've pulled in cardiologists

00:08:37.921 --> 00:08:40.503
and computer scientists and radiologists

00:08:40.527 --> 00:08:44.861
and astronomers, physicists,
chemists, computational physicists --

00:08:44.885 --> 00:08:47.076
I mean, we've brought
so many people together.

00:08:47.100 --> 00:08:48.723
And it's been enlightening

00:08:48.747 --> 00:08:52.635
to share domains and information
across borders.

00:08:52.659 --> 00:08:53.841
And we're still going.

00:08:53.865 --> 00:08:57.074
And although most of the people
up on the screen are from Harvard

00:08:57.098 --> 00:08:58.249
or Harvard Med,

00:08:58.273 --> 00:09:01.701
now we cross different institutions
and continents to work together.

00:09:01.725 --> 00:09:04.349
All I can say is,
it has just been wonderful.

00:09:04.373 --> 00:09:06.574
We're continuing to make new discoveries.

00:09:06.598 --> 00:09:08.495
And I just urge you:

00:09:08.519 --> 00:09:11.500
attend conferences not in your own domain,

00:09:11.524 --> 00:09:14.443
read books and journals not
in your own discipline,

00:09:14.467 --> 00:09:17.109
watch TED talks and come
to events like this

00:09:17.133 --> 00:09:19.887
and say hi to the neighbor
sitting next to you,

00:09:19.911 --> 00:09:21.408
because you really never know

00:09:21.432 --> 00:09:24.428
where your next great idea
is going to come from.

00:09:24.452 --> 00:09:25.651
Thank you.

00:09:25.675 --> 00:09:28.589
(Applause)
