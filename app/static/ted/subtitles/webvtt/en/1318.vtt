00:00:00.458 --> 00:00:03.444
I was told to come here
and tell you all stories,

00:00:03.444 --> 00:00:07.657
but what I'd like to do is instead
tell you why I'm suspicious of stories,

00:00:07.657 --> 00:00:10.006
why stories make me nervous.

00:00:10.006 --> 00:00:13.125
In fact, the more inspired
a story makes me feel,

00:00:13.125 --> 00:00:15.385
very often, the more nervous I get.

00:00:15.385 --> 00:00:16.515
(Laughter)

00:00:16.515 --> 00:00:19.305
So the best stories
are often the trickiest ones.

00:00:19.305 --> 00:00:22.695
The good and bad things about stories
is that they are a kind of filter.

00:00:22.695 --> 00:00:25.606
They take a lot of information,
and they leave some of it out,

00:00:25.606 --> 00:00:27.350
and they keep some of it in.

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:31.656
But the thing about this filter is
that it always leaves the same things in.

00:00:31.656 --> 00:00:34.777
You're always left
with the same few simple stories.

00:00:34.777 --> 00:00:37.173
There is the old saying
that just about every story

00:00:37.173 --> 00:00:40.614
can be summed up
as "a stranger came to town."

00:00:40.614 --> 00:00:42.466
There is a book by Christopher Booker,

00:00:42.466 --> 00:00:45.360
where he claims there are really
just seven types of stories.

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.030
There is monster, rags to riches, quest,

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:52.019
voyage and return,
comedy, tragedy, rebirth.

00:00:52.019 --> 00:00:54.234
You don't have to agree
with that list exactly,

00:00:54.234 --> 00:00:57.564
but the point is this:
if you think in terms of stories,

00:00:57.564 --> 00:01:01.776
you're telling yourself the same things
over and over again.

00:01:01.776 --> 00:01:04.796
There was a study done,
we asked some people--

00:01:10.723 --> 00:01:13.933
people were asked to describe their lives.

00:01:13.933 --> 00:01:15.614
When asked to describe their lives,

00:01:15.614 --> 00:01:18.861
what is interesting
is how few people said "mess".

00:01:18.861 --> 00:01:20.313
(Laughter)

00:01:20.313 --> 00:01:24.355
It's probably the best answer,
I don't mean that in a bad way.

00:01:24.355 --> 00:01:26.768
"Mess" can be liberating,
"mess" can be empowering,

00:01:26.768 --> 00:01:30.416
"mess" can be a way
of drawing upon multiple strengths.

00:01:30.416 --> 00:01:34.784
But what people wanted to say was,
"My life is a journey."

00:01:34.784 --> 00:01:39.530
51% wanted to turn
his or her life into a story.

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:44.368
11% said, "My life is a battle."
Again, that is a kind of story.

00:01:44.368 --> 00:01:48.472
8% said, "My life is a novel."
5% said, "My life is a play."

00:01:48.472 --> 00:01:51.798
I don't think anyone said,
"My life is a reality TV show."

00:01:51.798 --> 00:01:52.958
(Laughter)

00:01:52.958 --> 00:01:56.653
But again, we're imposing order
on the mess we observe,

00:01:56.653 --> 00:01:58.283
and it's taking the same patterns,

00:01:58.283 --> 00:02:01.349
and the thing is when something
is in the form of a story,

00:02:01.349 --> 00:02:03.853
often, we remember it when we shouldn't.

00:02:03.853 --> 00:02:05.426
So how many of you know the story

00:02:05.426 --> 00:02:08.197
about George Washington
and the cherry tree?

00:02:08.197 --> 00:02:10.467
It's not obvious that is
exactly what happened.

00:02:10.467 --> 00:02:15.405
The story of Paul Revere, it's not obvious
that that is exactly the way it happened.

00:02:15.405 --> 00:02:19.135
So again, we should be
suspicious of stories.

00:02:19.135 --> 00:02:22.468
We're biologically programmed
to respond to them.

00:02:22.468 --> 00:02:25.410
They contain a lot of information.
They have social power.

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:27.314
They connect us to other people.

00:02:27.314 --> 00:02:30.039
So they are like a candy that we're fed

00:02:30.039 --> 00:02:33.516
when we consume political information,
when we read novels.

00:02:33.516 --> 00:02:36.912
When we read non-fiction books,
we're really being fed stories.

00:02:36.912 --> 00:02:39.295
Non-fiction is, in a sense,
the new fiction.

00:02:39.295 --> 00:02:42.120
The book may happen to say true things,

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:46.550
but again, everything's taking
the same form of these stories.

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:50.449
So what are the problems
of relying too heavily on stories?

00:02:50.449 --> 00:02:52.346
You view your life like this

00:02:52.346 --> 00:02:55.696
instead of the mess
that it is or it ought to be.

00:02:55.696 --> 00:02:59.763
But more specifically,
I think of a few major problems

00:02:59.763 --> 00:03:02.801
when we think too much
in terms of narrative.

00:03:03.401 --> 00:03:05.455
First, narratives tend to be too simple,

00:03:05.455 --> 00:03:07.896
for the point of a narrative
is to strip it away,

00:03:07.896 --> 00:03:09.502
not just into 18 minutes,

00:03:09.502 --> 00:03:12.954
but most narratives 
you can present in a sentence or two.

00:03:12.954 --> 00:03:14.815
When you strip away detail,

00:03:14.815 --> 00:03:18.443
you tend to tell stories
in terms of good versus evil,

00:03:18.443 --> 00:03:22.044
whether it's a story about your own life
or a story about politics.

00:03:22.604 --> 00:03:26.458
I know some things actually are
good versus evil, we all know this, right?

00:03:26.458 --> 00:03:27.965
But I think, as a general rule,

00:03:27.965 --> 00:03:32.039
we're too inclined to tell
the good versus evil story.

00:03:32.039 --> 00:03:33.289
As a simple rule of thumb,

00:03:33.289 --> 00:03:37.539
just imagine that every time
you're telling a good versus evil story,

00:03:37.539 --> 00:03:41.715
you're basically lowering your IQ
by ten points or more.

00:03:41.715 --> 00:03:45.052
If you just adopt that
as a kind of inner mental habit,

00:03:45.052 --> 00:03:48.354
it's, in my view, one way to get
a lot smarter pretty quickly.

00:03:48.354 --> 00:03:49.973
You don't have to read any books.

00:03:49.973 --> 00:03:52.028
Just imagine yourself pressing a button

00:03:52.028 --> 00:03:54.646
every time you tell
the good versus evil story,

00:03:54.646 --> 00:03:56.223
and by pressing that button,

00:03:56.223 --> 00:03:58.793
you're lowering your IQ
by ten points or more.

00:03:59.283 --> 00:04:01.284
Another set of stories that are popular--

00:04:01.284 --> 00:04:04.651
if you know Oliver Stone's movies,
or Michael Moore's movies,

00:04:04.651 --> 00:04:08.253
you can't make a movie and say:
"It was all a big accident."

00:04:08.253 --> 00:04:12.927
No, it has to be a conspiracy,
people plotting together,

00:04:12.927 --> 00:04:16.307
because in a story,
a story is about intention.

00:04:16.307 --> 00:04:20.568
A story is not about spontaneous order
or complex human institutions

00:04:20.568 --> 00:04:23.748
which are the product of human action,
but not of human design.

00:04:23.748 --> 00:04:27.835
No, a story is about evil people
plotting together.

00:04:27.835 --> 00:04:30.473
So when you hear stories about plots,

00:04:30.473 --> 00:04:33.493
or even stories about good people
plotting things together,

00:04:33.493 --> 00:04:35.617
just like when you're watching movies,

00:04:35.617 --> 00:04:38.356
this, again, is reason to be suspicious.

00:04:38.356 --> 00:04:40.367
As a good rule of thumb, if you're asking:

00:04:40.367 --> 00:04:43.736
"When I hear a story, when should I
be especially suspicious?"

00:04:43.736 --> 00:04:48.692
If you hear a story and you think:
"Wow, that would make a great movie!"

00:04:48.692 --> 00:04:49.774
(Laughter)

00:04:49.774 --> 00:04:53.632
That's when the "uh-oh" reaction
should pop in a bit more,

00:04:53.632 --> 00:04:55.566
and you should start thinking in terms

00:04:55.566 --> 00:04:58.425
of how the whole thing
is maybe a bit of a mess.

00:04:59.285 --> 00:05:04.483
Another common story or storyline is
the claim that we "have to get tough".

00:05:05.233 --> 00:05:07.534
You'll hear this in so many contexts.

00:05:07.534 --> 00:05:12.801
We have to get tough with the banks.
We had to get tough with the labor unions.

00:05:12.801 --> 00:05:14.937
We need to get tough
with some other country,

00:05:14.937 --> 00:05:18.756
some foreign dictator,
someone we're negotiating with.

00:05:18.756 --> 00:05:21.105
Again, the point is not
against getting tough.

00:05:21.105 --> 00:05:22.865
Sometimes we should get tough.

00:05:22.865 --> 00:05:26.087
That we got tough with the Nazis
was a good thing.

00:05:26.827 --> 00:05:32.181
But this is again a story we fall back
upon all too readily, all too quickly.

00:05:32.181 --> 00:05:34.478
When we don't really know
why something happened,

00:05:34.478 --> 00:05:38.187
we blame someone, and we say:
"We need to get tough with them!"

00:05:38.187 --> 00:05:40.771
As if it had never occurred
to your predecessor,

00:05:40.771 --> 00:05:42.989
this idea of getting tough.

00:05:42.989 --> 00:05:46.095
I view it usually
as a kind of mental laziness.

00:05:46.095 --> 00:05:49.377
It's a simple story you tell:
"We need to get tough,

00:05:49.377 --> 00:05:52.078
we needed to get tough,
we will have to get tough."

00:05:52.078 --> 00:05:54.973
Usually, that is a kind of warning signal.

00:05:55.623 --> 00:05:58.784
Another kind of problem with stories is

00:05:58.784 --> 00:06:02.206
you can only fit so many stories
into your mind at once,

00:06:02.206 --> 00:06:05.268
or in the course of a day,
or even over the course of a lifetime.

00:06:05.268 --> 00:06:08.134
So your stories are serving
too many purposes.

00:06:08.134 --> 00:06:11.027
For instance, just to get
out of bed in the morning,

00:06:11.027 --> 00:06:13.110
you tell yourself the story

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:16.620
that your job is really important,
what you're doing is really important

00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:18.456
(Laughter)

00:06:18.456 --> 00:06:23.994
and maybe it is, but I tell myself
that story even when it's not.

00:06:24.694 --> 00:06:26.956
And you know what? That story works.

00:06:26.956 --> 00:06:28.610
It gets me out of bed.

00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:30.968
It's a kind of self-deception,

00:06:30.968 --> 00:06:33.575
but the problem comes
when I need to change that story.

00:06:33.575 --> 00:06:37.796
The whole point of the story is
that I grab onto it and I hold it,

00:06:37.796 --> 00:06:39.630
and it gets me out of bed.

00:06:39.630 --> 00:06:43.143
So when I'm really doing something
that is actually just a waste of time,

00:06:43.143 --> 00:06:44.958
in my mess of a life,

00:06:44.958 --> 00:06:49.369
I'm too tied into my story
that got me out of bed,

00:06:49.369 --> 00:06:53.107
and ideally, I ought to have some
very complex story map in my mind,

00:06:53.107 --> 00:06:56.962
you know, with combinatorials
and a matrix of computation, and the like,

00:06:56.962 --> 00:06:58.868
but that is not how stories work.

00:06:58.868 --> 00:07:00.927
Stories in order to work 
have to be simple,

00:07:00.927 --> 00:07:04.637
easily grasped, easily told
to others, easily remembered.

00:07:04.637 --> 00:07:07.747
So stories will serve dual
and conflicting purposes,

00:07:07.747 --> 00:07:10.636
and very often they will lead us astray.

00:07:10.636 --> 00:07:13.477
I used to think I was
within the camp of economists,

00:07:13.477 --> 00:07:17.537
I was one of the good guys,
and I was allied with other good guys,

00:07:17.537 --> 00:07:20.666
and we were fighting
the ideas of the bad guys.

00:07:20.666 --> 00:07:22.278
I used to think that!

00:07:22.828 --> 00:07:24.944
And probably, I was wrong.

00:07:24.944 --> 00:07:26.952
Maybe sometimes, I'm one of the good guys,

00:07:26.952 --> 00:07:31.283
but on some issues, I finally realized:
"Hey, I wasn't one of the good guys."

00:07:31.283 --> 00:07:34.705
I'm not sure I was the bad guy
in the sense of having evil intent,

00:07:34.705 --> 00:07:37.959
but it was very hard for me
to get away with that story.

00:07:39.959 --> 00:07:43.753
One interesting thing
about cognitive biases

00:07:43.753 --> 00:07:46.237
is they are the subject
of so many books these days.

00:07:46.237 --> 00:07:50.750
There's the Nudge book,
the Sway book, the Blink book,

00:07:50.750 --> 00:07:52.508
like the one-title book,

00:07:52.508 --> 00:07:55.681
all about the ways in which we screw up.

00:07:55.681 --> 00:07:57.137
And there are so many ways,

00:07:57.137 --> 00:08:00.865
but what I find interesting
is that none of these books identify

00:08:00.865 --> 00:08:05.067
what, to me, is the single, central,
most important way we screw up,

00:08:05.067 --> 00:08:08.762
and that is that we tell
ourselves too many stories,

00:08:08.762 --> 00:08:11.487
or we are too easily seduced by stories.

00:08:11.487 --> 00:08:13.577
Why don't these books tell us that?

00:08:13.577 --> 00:08:16.645
It's because the books themselves
are all about stories.

00:08:17.205 --> 00:08:20.983
The more of these books you read,
you're learning about some of your biases,

00:08:20.983 --> 00:08:24.920
but you're making some
of your other biases essentially worse.

00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:28.262
So the books themselves
are part of your cognitive bias.

00:08:28.822 --> 00:08:31.376
Often, people buy them
as a kind of talisman, like:

00:08:31.376 --> 00:08:35.243
"I bought this book. I won't be
'Predictably Irrational'."

00:08:35.243 --> 00:08:37.903
(Laughter)

00:08:37.903 --> 00:08:39.835
It's like people want to hear the worst,

00:08:39.835 --> 00:08:43.576
so psychologically, they can prepare
for it or defend against it.

00:08:43.576 --> 00:08:46.714
It's why there is
such a market for pessimism.

00:08:46.714 --> 00:08:49.617
But to think that by buying the book
gets you somewhere,

00:08:49.617 --> 00:08:51.535
that's maybe the bigger fallacy.

00:08:51.535 --> 00:08:54.797
It's just like the evidence that shows
that the most dangerous people

00:08:54.797 --> 00:08:57.556
are those who have been taught
some financial literacy.

00:08:57.556 --> 00:09:00.179
They're the ones who go out
and make the worst mistakes.

00:09:00.179 --> 00:09:03.043
It's the people who realize
they don't know anything at all,

00:09:03.043 --> 00:09:05.052
that end up doing pretty well.

00:09:05.592 --> 00:09:07.155
A third problem with stories

00:09:07.155 --> 00:09:10.533
is that outsiders
manipulate us using stories,

00:09:10.533 --> 00:09:13.939
and we all like to think advertising
only works on the other guy,

00:09:13.939 --> 00:09:18.483
but, of course, that's not how it is,
advertising works on all of us.

00:09:18.483 --> 00:09:20.796
So if you're too attached to stories,

00:09:20.796 --> 00:09:25.008
what will happen is people
selling products come along,

00:09:25.008 --> 00:09:27.386
and they will bundle
their product with a story.

00:09:27.386 --> 00:09:29.033
You're like, "Hey, a free story!"

00:09:29.033 --> 00:09:30.678
And you end up buying the product,

00:09:30.678 --> 00:09:32.868
because the product
and the story go together.

00:09:32.868 --> 00:09:33.906
(Laugther)

00:09:33.906 --> 00:09:35.845
If you think about how capitalism works,

00:09:35.845 --> 00:09:37.198
there is a bias here.

00:09:37.198 --> 00:09:39.932
Let's consider two kinds
of stories about cars.

00:09:40.422 --> 00:09:43.380
Story A is: "Buy this car,

00:09:43.380 --> 00:09:46.998
and you will have beautiful, romantic
partners and a fascinating life."

00:09:46.998 --> 00:09:48.508
(Laughter)

00:09:49.398 --> 00:09:50.628
There are a lot of people

00:09:50.628 --> 00:09:53.123
who have a financial incentive
to promote that story.

00:09:53.123 --> 00:09:55.221
But, say, the alternative story is:

00:09:55.671 --> 00:09:59.661
"You don't actually need a car
as nice as your income would indicate.

00:09:59.661 --> 00:10:03.102
What you usually do is look
at what your peers do and copy them.

00:10:03.102 --> 00:10:05.246
That is a good heuristic
for lots of problems,

00:10:05.246 --> 00:10:07.569
but when it comes to cars,
just buy a Toyota."

00:10:07.569 --> 00:10:09.749
(Laughter)

00:10:09.749 --> 00:10:11.490
Maybe Toyota has an incentive there,

00:10:11.490 --> 00:10:14.686
but even Toyota is making
more money off the luxury cars,

00:10:14.686 --> 00:10:16.623
and less money off the cheaper cars.

00:10:16.623 --> 00:10:19.303
So if you think which set of stories
you end up hearing,

00:10:19.303 --> 00:10:22.783
you end up hearing the glamor stories,
the seductive stories,

00:10:22.783 --> 00:10:25.060
and again I'm telling you,
don't trust them.

00:10:25.060 --> 00:10:29.281
There are people using
your love of stories to manipulate you.

00:10:30.331 --> 00:10:31.501
Pull back and say:

00:10:31.501 --> 00:10:32.599
"What are the messages,

00:10:32.599 --> 00:10:35.383
what are the stories
that no one has an incentive to tell?"

00:10:35.383 --> 00:10:39.970
Start telling yourself those, and then see
if any of your decisions change.

00:10:39.970 --> 00:10:41.646
That is one simple way.

00:10:41.646 --> 00:10:45.107
You can never get out of the pattern
of thinking in terms of stories,

00:10:45.107 --> 00:10:48.743
but you can improve the extent
to which you think in stories,

00:10:48.743 --> 00:10:50.807
and make some better decisions.

00:10:51.517 --> 00:10:54.671
So if I'm thinking about this talk,
I'm wondering, of course,

00:10:54.671 --> 00:10:57.298
what is it you take away from this talk?

00:10:57.298 --> 00:11:01.077
What story do you take away
from Tyler Cowen?

00:11:01.510 --> 00:11:04.686
One story you might be
like the story of the quest.

00:11:04.686 --> 00:11:07.111
"Tyler was a man on a quest.

00:11:07.111 --> 00:11:12.703
Tyler came here, and he told us
not to think so much in terms of stories."

00:11:13.418 --> 00:11:15.908
That would be a story
you could tell about this talk.

00:11:15.908 --> 00:11:17.805
(Laughter)

00:11:17.805 --> 00:11:19.787
It would fit a pretty well-known pattern.

00:11:19.787 --> 00:11:22.676
You might remember it.
You could tell it to other people.

00:11:22.676 --> 00:11:24.396
"This weird guy came, and he said,

00:11:24.396 --> 00:11:27.796
'Don't think in terms of stories.
Let me tell you what happened today!'"

00:11:27.796 --> 00:11:28.799
(Laughter)

00:11:28.799 --> 00:11:30.330
And you tell your story.

00:11:30.330 --> 00:11:31.971
(Laugther)

00:11:33.021 --> 00:11:37.343
Another possibility is
you might tell a story of rebirth.

00:11:37.833 --> 00:11:42.052
You might say, "I used to think
too much in terms of stories

00:11:42.052 --> 00:11:44.794
(Laughter)

00:11:44.794 --> 00:11:46.912
but then I heard Tyler Cowen

00:11:46.912 --> 00:11:47.878
(Laughter)

00:11:47.878 --> 00:11:51.152
and now I think less in terms of stories!"

00:11:51.152 --> 00:11:53.952
That too is a narrative you will remember,

00:11:53.952 --> 00:11:57.773
you can tell to other people,
and again, it may stick.

00:11:58.463 --> 00:12:02.506
You also could tell
a story of deep tragedy.

00:12:03.086 --> 00:12:05.021
"This guy Tyler Cowen came

00:12:05.021 --> 00:12:06.271
(Laughter)

00:12:06.271 --> 00:12:08.873
and he told us not to think
in terms of stories,

00:12:08.873 --> 00:12:10.811
but all he could do was tell us stories

00:12:10.811 --> 00:12:11.877
(Laughter)

00:12:11.877 --> 00:12:15.838
about how other people think
too much in terms of stories."

00:12:15.838 --> 00:12:17.797
(Laughter)

00:12:18.454 --> 00:12:23.073
So, today, which is it?
Is it like quest, rebirth, tragedy?

00:12:23.523 --> 00:12:26.016
Or maybe some combination of the three?

00:12:26.626 --> 00:12:29.404
I'm really not sure,
and I'm not here to tell you

00:12:29.404 --> 00:12:33.359
to burn your DVD player
and throw out your Tolstoy.

00:12:33.939 --> 00:12:38.231
To think in terms of stories
is fundamentally human.

00:12:38.231 --> 00:12:43.434
There is a Gabriel Garcia Marquez
memoir "Living to Tell the Tale"

00:12:44.004 --> 00:12:47.465
that we use memory in stories
to make sense of what we've done,

00:12:47.465 --> 00:12:51.958
to give meaning to our lives, to establish
connections with other people.

00:12:51.958 --> 00:12:56.028
None of this will go away,
should go away, or can go away.

00:12:56.028 --> 00:13:00.658
But again, as an economist,
I'm thinking about life on the margin,

00:13:01.338 --> 00:13:02.954
the extra decision.

00:13:02.954 --> 00:13:07.063
Should we think more in terms of stories,
or less in terms of stories?

00:13:07.063 --> 00:13:11.195
When we hear stories,
should we be more suspicious?

00:13:11.195 --> 00:13:13.963
And what kind of stories
should we be suspicious of?

00:13:13.963 --> 00:13:18.587
Again, I'm telling you it's the stories,
very often, that you like the most,

00:13:18.587 --> 00:13:22.447
that you find the most rewarding,
the most inspiring.

00:13:22.447 --> 00:13:26.148
The stories that don't focus
on opportunity cost,

00:13:26.148 --> 00:13:29.969
or the complex, unintended
consequences of human action,

00:13:29.969 --> 00:13:33.863
because that very often
does not make for a good story.

00:13:33.863 --> 00:13:38.513
So often a story is a story
of triumph, a story of struggle;

00:13:38.513 --> 00:13:43.020
there are opposing forces,
which are either evil or ignorant;

00:13:43.020 --> 00:13:46.310
there is a person on a quest,
someone making a voyage,

00:13:46.310 --> 00:13:48.369
and a stranger coming to town.

00:13:49.049 --> 00:13:53.769
And those are your categories,
but don't let them make you too happy.

00:13:54.870 --> 00:13:56.219
(Laughter)

00:13:57.419 --> 00:13:59.194
As an alternative,

00:13:59.954 --> 00:14:03.283
at the margin
- again, no burning of Tolstoy -

00:14:03.283 --> 00:14:06.239
but just be a little more messy.

00:14:06.739 --> 00:14:11.226
If I actually had to live those journeys,
and quests, and battles,

00:14:11.226 --> 00:14:13.263
that would be so oppressive to me!

00:14:13.263 --> 00:14:16.000
It's like, my goodness,
can't I just have my life

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:19.645
in its messy, ordinary 
- I hesitate to use the word - glory

00:14:19.645 --> 00:14:21.655
but that it's fun for me?

00:14:21.655 --> 00:14:24.008
Do I really have to follow
some kind of narrative?

00:14:24.008 --> 00:14:25.240
Can't I just live?

00:14:25.780 --> 00:14:28.826
So be more comfortable with messy.

00:14:29.456 --> 00:14:32.176
Be more comfortable with agnostic,

00:14:32.176 --> 00:14:34.871
and I mean this about the things
that make you feel good.

00:14:34.871 --> 00:14:37.644
It's so easy to pick out
a few areas to be agnostic in,

00:14:37.644 --> 00:14:38.997
and then feel good about it,

00:14:38.997 --> 00:14:42.828
like, "I am agnostic
about religion, or politics."

00:14:42.828 --> 00:14:47.040
It's a kind of portfolio move you make
to be more dogmatic elsewhere, right?

00:14:47.040 --> 00:14:49.220
(Laughter)

00:14:49.220 --> 00:14:50.290
Sometimes,

00:14:50.290 --> 00:14:53.836
the most intellectually trustworthy people
are the ones who pick one area,

00:14:53.836 --> 00:14:57.028
and they are totally dogmatic in that,
so pig-headedly unreasonable,

00:14:57.028 --> 00:14:59.678
that you think,
"How can they possibly believe that?"

00:14:59.678 --> 00:15:04.170
But it soaks up their stubbornness,

00:15:04.170 --> 00:15:06.900
and then, on other things,
they can be pretty open-minded.

00:15:07.340 --> 00:15:11.079
So don't fall into the trap of thinking
because you're agnostic on some things,

00:15:11.079 --> 00:15:13.092
that you're being fundamentally reasonable

00:15:13.092 --> 00:15:16.192
about your self-deception, your stories,
and your open-mindedness.

00:15:16.192 --> 00:15:18.339
(Laughter)

00:15:18.889 --> 00:15:22.756
[Think about] this idea of hovering,
of epistemological hovering,

00:15:22.756 --> 00:15:26.413
and messiness, and incompleteness,

00:15:26.413 --> 00:15:29.049
[and how] not everything 
ties up into a neat bow,

00:15:29.049 --> 00:15:31.879
and you're really not on a journey here.

00:15:31.879 --> 00:15:34.746
You're here for some
messy reason or reasons,

00:15:34.746 --> 00:15:38.833
and maybe you don't know what it is,
and maybe I don't know what it is,

00:15:38.833 --> 00:15:42.113
but anyway, I'm happy to be invited,
and thank you all for listening.

00:15:42.113 --> 00:15:43.111
(Laughter)

00:15:43.111 --> 00:15:44.822
(Applause)
