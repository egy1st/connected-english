Lauren Hodge: If you were going to a restaurant and wanted a healthier option,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
which would you choose, grilled or fried chicken?

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Now most people would answer grilled,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
and it's true that grilled chicken does contain less fat and fewer calories.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
However, grilled chicken poses a hidden danger.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
The hidden danger is heterocyclic amines --

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
specifically phenomethylimidazopyridine,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
or PhIP --

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
(laughter)

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
which is the immunogenic or carcinogenic compound.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
A carcinogen is any substance or agent

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
that causes abnormal growth of cells,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
which can also cause them to metastasize or spread.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
They are also organic compounds

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
in which one or more of the hydrogens in ammonia

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
is replaced with a more complex group.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Studies show that antioxidants

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
are known to decrease these heterocyclic amines.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
However, no studies exist yet

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
that show how or why.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
These here are five different organizations that classify carcinogens.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
And as you can see, none of the organizations consider the compounds to be safe,

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
which justifies the need to decrease them in our diet.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
Now you might wonder how a 13 year-old girl could come up with this idea.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
And I was led to it through a series of events.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
I first learned about it through a lawsuit I read about in my doctor's office --

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
(Laughter)

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
which was between the Physician's Committee for Responsible Medicine

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
and seven different fast food restaurants.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
They weren't sued because there was carcinogens in the chicken,

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000
but they were sued because of California's Proposition 65,

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
which stated that if there's anything dangerous in the products

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
then the companies had to give a clear warning.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
So I was very surprised about this.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
And I was wondering why nobody knew more

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
about this dangerous grilled chicken,

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
which doesn't seem very harmful.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
But then one night, my mom was cooking grilled chicken for dinner,

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
and I noticed that the edges of the chicken,

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
which had been marinated in lemon juice, turned white.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
And later in biology class, I learned that it's due to a process called denaturing,

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
which is where the proteins will change shape

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
and lose their ability to chemically function.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
So I combined these two ideas and I formulated a hypothesis,

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
saying that, could possibly

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
the carcinogens be decreased due to a marinade

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
and could it be due to the differences in PH?

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
So my idea was born,

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
and I had the project set up and a hypothesis,

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
so what was my next step?

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
Well obviously I had to find a lab to work at

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
because I didn't have the equipment in my school.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
I thought this would be easy,

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
but I emailed about 200 different people

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
within a five-hour radius of where I lived,

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000
and I got one positive response that said that they could work with me.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
Most of the others either never responded back,

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
said they didn't have the time

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
or didn't have the equipment and couldn't help me.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
So it was a big commitment

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
to drive to the lab to work multiple times.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
However, it was a great opportunity to work in a real lab --

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
so I could finally start my project.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
The first stage was completed at home,

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
which consisted of marinating the chicken,

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
grilling the chicken, amassing it

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000
and preparing it to be transported to the lab.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
The second stage was completed

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
at the Penn State University main campus lab,

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
which is where I extracted the chemicals,

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
changed the PH so I could run it through the equipment

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
and separated the compounds I needed

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000
from the rest of the chicken.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
The final stages, when I ran the samples

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
through a high-pressure

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000
liquid chromatography mass spectrometer,

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000
which separated the compounds and analyzed the chemicals

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
and told me exactly how much carcinogens I had

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
in my chicken.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
So when I went through the data, I had very surprising results,

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000
because I found that four out of the five marinating ingredients

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
actually inhibited the carcinogen formation.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
When compared with the unmarinated chicken,

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000
which is what I used as my control,

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
I found that lemon juice worked by far the best,

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000
which decreased the carcinogens

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000
by about 98 percent.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.000
The saltwater marinade and the brown sugar marinade

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
also worked very well,

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
decreasing the carcinogens by about 60 percent.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000
Olive oil slightly decreased the PhIP formation,

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000
but it was nearly negligible.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000
And the soy sauce results were inconclusive

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000
because of the large data range,

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000
but it seems like soy sauce

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000
actually increased the potential carcinogens.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000
Another important factor that I didn't take into account initially

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000
was the time cooked.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000
And I found that if you increase the time cooked,

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000
the amount of carcinogens rapidly increases.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
So the best way to marinate chicken, based on this,

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
is to, not under-cook,

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
but definitely don't over-cook and char the chicken,

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:05.000
and marinate in either lemon juice, brown sugar or saltwater.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:11.000
(Applause)

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.000
Based on these findings, I have a question for you.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.000
Would you be willing to make a simple change in your diet

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000
that could potentially save your life?

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000
Now I'm not saying that if you eat grilled chicken that's not marinated,

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000
you're definitely going to catch cancer and die.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.000
However, anything you can do

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000
to decrease the risk of potential carcinogens

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000
can definitely increase the quality of lifestyle.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
Is it worth it to you?

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000
How will you cook your chicken now?

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:50.000
(Applause)

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
Shree Bose: Hi everyone. I'm Shree Bose.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000
I was the 17-18 year-old age category winner

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000
and then the grand prize winner.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000
And I want all of you

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000
to imagine a little girl

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.000
holding a dead blue spinach plant.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.000
And she's standing in front of you and she's explaining to you

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000
that little kids will eat their vegetables

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000
if they're different colors.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000
Sounds ridiculous, right.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000
But that was me years ago.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000
And that was my first science fair project.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.000
It got a bit more complicated from there.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000
My older brother Panaki Bose

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.000
spent hours of his time explaining atoms to me

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.000
when I barely understood basic algebra.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.000
My parents suffered through many more of my science fair projects,

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.000
including a remote controlled garbage can.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000
(Laughter)

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.000
And then came the summer after my freshman year,

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.000
when my grandfather passed away due to cancer.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.000
And I remember watching my family go through that

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.000
and thinking that I never wanted another family

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.000
to feel that kind of loss.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000
So, armed with all the wisdom

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.000
of freshman year biology,

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.000
I decided I wanted to do cancer research

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.000
at 15.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000
Good plan.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.000
So I started emailing all of these professors in my area

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:07.000
asking to work under their supervision in a lab.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.000
Got rejected by all except one.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.000
And then went on, my next summer,

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.000
to work under Dr. Basu

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.000
at the UNT Health Center at Fort Worth, Texas.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.000
And that is where the research began.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.000
So ovarian cancer

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.000
is one of those cancers that most people don't know about,

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.000
or at least don't pay that much attention to.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.000
But yet, it's the fifth leading cause of cancer deaths

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.000
among women in the United States.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.000
In fact, one in 70 women

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.000
will be diagnosed with ovarian cancer.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000
One in 100

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.000
will die from it.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.000
Chemotherapy, one of the most effective ways

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.000
used to treat cancer today,

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000
involves giving patients really high doses of chemicals

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.000
to try and kill off cancer cells.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.000
Cisplatin is a relatively common

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:55.000
ovarian cancer chemotherapy drug --

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.000
a relatively simple molecule made in the lab

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000
that messes with the DNA of cancer cells

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000
and causes them to kill themselves.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000
Sounds great, right?

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.000
But here's the problem:

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.000
sometimes patients become resistant to the drug,

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.000
and then years after they've been declared to be cancer free,

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.000
they come back.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.000
And this time, they no longer respond to the drug.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.000
It's a huge problem.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.000
In fact, it's one of the biggest problems

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.000
with chemotherapy today.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.000
So we wanted to figure out

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.000
how these ovarian cancer cells are becoming resistant

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000
to this drug called Cisplatin.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000
And we wanted to figure this out,

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.000
because if we could figure that out,

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:36.000
then we might be able to prevent that resistance from ever happening.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.000
So that's what we set out to do.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:41.000
And we thought it had something to do with this protein called AMP kinase,

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.000
an energy protein.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:46.000
So we ran all of these tests blocking the protein,

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.000
and we saw this huge shift.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.000
I mean, on the slide, you can see

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000
that on our sensitive side,

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000
these cells that are responding to the drug,

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.000
when we start blocking the protein,

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:59.000
the number of dying cells -- those colored dots --

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.000
they're going down.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:04.000
But then on this side, with the same treatment,

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:07.000
they're going up -- interesting.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.000
But those are dots on a screen for you;

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.000
what exactly does that mean?

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.000
Well basically that means

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.000
that this protein is changing

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.000
from the sensitive cell to the resistant cell.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:21.000
And in fact, it might be changing the cells themselves

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:24.000
to make the cells resistant.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000
And that's huge.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000
In fact, it means that if a patient comes in

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.000
and they're resistant to this drug,

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.000
then if we give them a chemical to block this protein,

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.000
then we can treat them again

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.000
with the same drug.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:40.000
And that's huge for chemotherapy effectiveness --

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:44.000
possibly for many different types of cancer.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000
So that was my work,

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:49.000
and it was my way of reimagining the future

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:53.000
for future research, with figuring out exactly what this protein does,

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:56.000
but also for the future of chemotherapy effectiveness --

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:59.000
so maybe all grandfathers with cancer

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:02.000
have a little bit more time to spend with their grandchildren.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:06.000
But my work wasn't just about the research.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:09.000
It was about finding my passion.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.000
That's why being the grand prize winner

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.000
of the Google Global Science Fair --

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.000
cute picture, right --

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:18.000
it was so exciting to me and it was such an amazing honor.

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.000
And ever since then,

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.000
I've gotten to do some pretty cool stuff --

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.000
from getting to meet the president

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.000
to getting to be on this stage

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.000
to talk to all of you guys.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:31.000
But like I said, my journey wasn't just about the research,

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.000
it was about finding my passion,

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.000
and it was about making my own opportunities

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:38.000
when I didn't even know what I was doing.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.000
It was about inspiration

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.000
and determination

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:44.000
and never giving up on my interest

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:47.000
for science and learning and growing.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:50.000
After all, my story begins

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.000
with a dried, withered spinach plant

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.000
and it's only getting better from there.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.000
Thank you.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:06.000
(Applause)

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:11.000
Naomi Shah: Hi everyone. I'm Naomi Shah,

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.000
and today I'll be talking to you about my research

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.000
involving indoor air quality

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:17.000
and asthmatic patients.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:20.000
1.6 million deaths worldwide.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:23.000
One death every 20 seconds.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:27.000
People spend over 90 percent of their lives indoors.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.000
And the economic burden of asthma

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:32.000
exceeds that of HIV and tuberculosis combined.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:35.000
Now these statistics had a huge impact on me,

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:38.000
but what really sparked my interest in my research

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.000
was watching both my dad and my brother

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.000
suffer from chronic allergies year-round.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.000
It confused me;

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.000
why did these allergy symptoms persist

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.000
well past the pollen season?

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:51.000
With this question in mind, I started researching,

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:54.000
and I soon found that indoor air pollutants were the culprit.

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.000
As soon as I realized this,

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.000
I investigated the underlying relationship

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.000
between four prevalent air pollutants

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:03.000
and their affect on the lung health of asthmatic patients.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:06.000
At first, I just wanted to figure out

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:09.000
which of these four pollutants have the largest negative health impact

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:12.000
on the lung health of asthmatic patients.

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:15.000
But soon after, I developed a novel mathematical model

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.000
that essentially quantifies the effect

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:20.000
of these environmental pollutants

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.000
on the lung health of asthmatic patients.

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.000
And it surprises me

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.000
that no model currently exists

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.000
that quantifies the effect of environmental factors

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.000
on human lung health,

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:33.000
because that relationship seems so important.

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.000
So with that in mind,

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:37.000
I started researching more, I started investigating more,

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.000
and I became very passionate.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.000
Because I realized

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:43.000
that if we could find a way to target remediation,

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.000
we could also find a way

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:49.000
to treat asthmatic patients more effectively.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.000
For example, volatile organic compounds

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.000
are chemical pollutants

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.000
that are found in our schools, homes and workplaces.

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:57.000
They're everywhere.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.000
These chemical pollutants

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.000
are currently not a criteria air pollutant,

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.000
as defined by the U.S. Clean Air Act.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:05.000
Which is surprising to me,

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:07.000
because these chemical pollutants, through my research,

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:10.000
I show that they had a very large negative impact

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.000
on the lung health of asthmatic patients

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.000
and thus should be regulated.

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.000
So today I want to show you

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:19.000
my interactive software model that I created.

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:21.000
I'm going to show it to you on my laptop.

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:23.000
And I have a volunteer subject in the audience today,

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:25.000
Julie.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:28.000
And all of Julie's data has been pre-entered

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.000
into my interactive software model.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.000
And this can be used by anyone.

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.000
So I want you to imagine that you're in Julie's shoes,

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.000
or someone who's really close to you

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:39.000
who suffers from asthma or another lung disorder.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:41.000
So Julie's going to her doctor's office

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.000
to get treated for her asthma.

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:45.000
And the doctor has her sit down,

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:48.000
and he takes her peak expiratory flow rate --

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.000
which is essentially her exhalation rate,

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:53.000
or the amount of air that she can breathe out in one breath.

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.000
So that peak expiratory flow rate,

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.000
I've entered it up into the interactive software model.

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:00.000
I've also entered in her age, her gender and her height.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.000
I've assumed that she lives in an average household

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:04.000
with average air pollutant levels.

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:06.000
So any user can come in here

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.000
and click on "lung function report"

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:10.000
and it'll take them to this report that I created.

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:14.000
And this report really drives home the crux of my research.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:18.000
So what it shows -- if you want to focus on that top graph in the right-hand corner --

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:20.000
it shows Julie's actual peak expiratory flow rate

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.000
in the yellow bar.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:25.000
This is the measurement that she took in her doctor's office.

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:27.000
In the blue bar at the bottom of the graph,

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:30.000
it shows what her peak expiratory flow rate,

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.000
what her exhalation rate or lung health, should be

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:35.000
based on her age, gender and height.

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:38.000
So the doctor sees this difference between the yellow bar and the blue bar,

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:41.000
and he says, "Wow, we need to give her steroids,

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:44.000
medication and inhalers."

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:47.000
But I want everyone here to reimagine a world

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:49.000
where instead of prescribing steroids,

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:51.000
inhalers and medication,

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:53.000
the doctor turns to Julie and says,

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.000
"Why don't you go home and clean out your air filters.

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.000
Clean out the air ducts in your home,

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:59.000
in your workplace, in your school.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:02.000
Stop the use of incense and candles.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.000
And if you're remodeling your house,

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:07.000
take out all the carpeting and put in hardwood flooring."

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:09.000
Because these solutions are natural,

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:11.000
these solutions are sustainable,

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:14.000
and these solutions are long-term investments --

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.000
long-term investments that we're making

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.000
for our generation and for future generations.

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:21.000
Because these environmental solutions

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:24.000
that Julie can make in her home, her workplace and her school

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:27.000
are impacting everyone that lives around her.

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:29.000
So I'm very passionate about this research

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:31.000
and I really want to continue it

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:34.000
and expand it to more disorders besides asthma,

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:37.000
more respiratory disorders, as well as more pollutants.

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.000
But before I end my talk today,

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:41.000
I want to leave you with one saying.

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:44.000
And that saying is that genetics loads the gun,

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.000
but the environment pulls the trigger.

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.000
And that made a huge impact on me

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:50.000
when I was doing this research.

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:52.000
Because what I feel, is a lot of us think

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:55.000
that the environment is at a macro level,

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:57.000
that we can't do anything to change our air quality

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:00.000
or to change the climate or anything.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:03.000
But if each one of us takes initiative in our own home,

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:06.000
in our own school and in our own workplace,

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:08.000
we can make a huge difference in air quality.

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:12.000
Because remember, we spend 90 percent of our lives indoors.

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:15.000
And air quality and air pollutants

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:18.000
have a huge impact on the lung health of asthmatic patients,

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.000
anyone with a respiratory disorder

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:22.000
and really all of us in general.

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:24.000
So I want you to reimagine a world

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:26.000
with better air quality,

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:28.000
better quality of life

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:30.000
and better quality of living for everyone

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:32.000
including our future generations.

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:34.000
Thank you.

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:41.000
(Applause)

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:43.000
Lisa Ling: Right.

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:48.000
Can I have Shree and Lauren come up really quickly?

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:50.000
Your Google Science Fair champions.

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:52.000
Your winners.

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:55.000
(Applause)
