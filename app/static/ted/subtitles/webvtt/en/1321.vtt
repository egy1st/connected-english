00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Amongst all the troubling deficits we struggle with today --

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
we think of financial and economic primarily --

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
the ones that concern me most

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
is the deficit of political dialogue --

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
our ability to address modern conflicts

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
as they are,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
to go to the source of what they're all about

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
and to understand the key players

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
and to deal with them.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
We who are diplomats,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
we are trained to deal with conflicts between states and issues between states.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
And I can tell you, our agenda is full.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
There is trade, there is disarmament,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
there is cross-border relations.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
But the picture is changing,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
and we are seeing that there are new key players

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
coming onto the scene.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
We loosely call them "groups."

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
They may represent social, religious,

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
political, economic, military realities.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
And we struggle with how to deal with them.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
The rules of engagement:

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
how to talk, when to talk,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
and how to deal with them.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
Let me show you a slide here

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
which illustrates the character of conflicts

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
since 1946 until today.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
You see the green

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
is a traditional interstate conflict,

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
the ones we used to read about.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
The red is modern conflict,

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
conflicts within states.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
These are quite different,

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
and they are outside the grasp

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
of modern diplomacy.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
And the core of these key actors

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
are groups

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
who represent different interests

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
inside countries.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
And the way they deal with their conflicts rapidly spreads to other countries.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
So in a way, it is everybody's business.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
Another acknowledgment we've seen during these years,

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
recent years,

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
is that very few

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.000
of these domestic interstate, intrastate conflicts

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
can be solved militarily.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
They may have to be dealt with with military means,

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
but they cannot be solved by military means.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
They need political solutions.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
And we, therefore, have a problem,

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
because they escape traditional diplomacy.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
And we have among states

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
a reluctance in dealing with them.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
Plus, during the last decade,

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
we've been in the mode

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
where dealing with groups

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
was conceptually and politically dangerous.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
After 9/11,

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
either you were with us or against us.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
It was black or white.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
And groups are very often

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
immediately label terrorists.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000
And who would talk to terrorists?

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
The West, as I would see it,

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
comes out of that decade weakened,

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000
because we didn't understand the group.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000
So we've spent more time

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000
on focusing on why we should not talk to others

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
than finding out how we talk to others.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000
Now I'm not naive.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
You cannot talk to everybody all the time.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000
And there are times you should walk.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
And sometimes military intervention is necessary.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000
I happen to believe that Libya was necessary

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000
and that military intervention in Afghanistan was also necessary.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000
And my country relies on its security

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000
through military alliance, that's clear.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000
But still we have a large deficit

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000
in dealing with and understanding modern conflict.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000
Let us turn to Afghanistan.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
10 years after that military intervention,

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
that country is far from secure.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000
The situation, to be honest, is very serious.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.000
Now again, the military is necessary,

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.000
but the military is no problem-solver.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.000
When I first came to Afghanistan in 2005 as a foreign minister,

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000
I met the commander of ISAF,

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000
the international troops.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000
And he told me that, "This can be won militarily, minister.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.000
We just have to persevere."

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000
Now four COM ISAF's later,

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000
we hear a different message:

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000
"This cannot be won militarily.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000
We need military presence,

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000
but we need to move to politics.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000
We can only solve this through a political solution.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
And it is not us who will solve it;

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
Afghans have to solve it."

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
But then they need a different political process

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:05.000
than the one they were given in 2001, 2002.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.000
They need an inclusive process

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.000
where the real fabric of this very complicated society

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000
can deal with their issues.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000
Everybody seems to agree with that.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000
It was very controversial to say three, four, five years ago.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000
Now everybody agrees.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.000
But now, as we prepare to talk,

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.000
we understand how little we know.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000
Because we didn't talk.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000
We didn't grasp what was going on.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000
The International Committee of the Red Cross, the ICRC,

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000
is talking to everyone,

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.000
and it is doing so because it is neutral.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000
And that's one reason why

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000
that organization probably

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000
is the best informed key player

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000
to understand modern conflict --

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000
because they talk.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.000
My point is that you don't have to be neutral to talk.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000
And you don't have to agree

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000
when you sit down with the other side.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.000
And you can always walk.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000
But if you don't talk,

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000
you can't engage the other side.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000
And the other side which you're going to engage

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.000
is the one with whom you profoundly disagree.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.000
Prime Minister Rabin said when he engaged the Oslo process,

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000
"You don't make peace with your friends,

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000
you make peace with your enemies."

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000
It's hard, but it is necessary.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000
Let me go one step further.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000
This is Tahrir Square.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000
There's a revolution going on.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000
The Arab Spring is heading into fall

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000
and is moving into winter.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.000
It will last for a long, long time.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.000
And who knows what it will be called in the end.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000
That's not the point.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.000
The point is that we are probably seeing,

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000
for the first time in the history of the Arab world,

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000
a revolution bottom-up --

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000
people's revolution.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.000
Social groups are taking to the streets.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000
And we find out in the West

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.000
that we know very little about what's happening.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:57.000
Because we never talk to the people in these countries.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.000
Most governments followed

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000
the dictate of the authoritarian leaders

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.000
to stay away from these different groups,

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:07.000
because they were terrorists.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.000
So now that they are emerging in the street

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.000
and we salute the democratic revolution,

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000
we find out how little we know.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.000
Right now, the discussion goes,

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.000
"Should we talk to the Muslim Brotherhood?

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.000
Should we talk to Hamas?

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.000
If we talk to them, we may legitimize them."

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000
I think that is wrong.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000
If you talk in the right way, you make it very clear

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.000
that talking is not agreeing.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.000
And how can we tell the Muslim Brotherhood,

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.000
as we should,

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:39.000
that they must respect minority rights,

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.000
if we don't accept majority rights?

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.000
Because they may turn out to be a majority.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.000
How can we escape [having] a double-standard,

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.000
if we at the same time preach democracy

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000
and at the same time

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000
don't want to deal with the groups that are representative?

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.000
How will we ever be interlocutors?

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000
Now my diplomats are instructed

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000
to talk to all these groups.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.000
But talking can be done in different ways.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:08.000
We make a distinction between talking from a diplomatic level

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:11.000
and talking at the political level.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.000
Now talking can be accompanied with aid or not with aid.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.000
Talking can be accompanied with inclusion or not inclusion.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.000
There's a big array

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.000
of the ways of dealing with this.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.000
So if we refuse

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:26.000
to talk to these new groups

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.000
that are going to be dominating the news in years to come,

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000
we will further radicalization,

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.000
I believe.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:36.000
We will make the road from violent activities into politics

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.000
harder to travel.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:41.000
And if we cannot demonstrate to these groups

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.000
that if you move towards democracy,

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:46.000
if you move towards taking part

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:49.000
in civilized and normal standards among states,

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:52.000
there are some rewards on the other side.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000
The paradox here

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.000
is that the last decade probably was a lost decade

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.000
for making progress on this.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:03.000
And the paradox is that the decade before the last decade was so promising --

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.000
and for one reason primarily.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.000
And the reason is what happened in South Africa:

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.000
Nelson Mandela.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000
When Mandela came out of prison

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.000
after 27 years of captivity,

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.000
if he had told his people,

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.000
"It's time to take up the arms,

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.000
it's time to fight,"

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.000
he would have been followed.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.000
And I think the international community

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.000
would have said, "Fair enough.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.000
It's their right to fight."

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:32.000
Now as you know, Mandela didn't do that.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:35.000
In his memoirs, "Long Road to Freedom,"

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.000
he wrote that he survived

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:40.000
during those years of captivity

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:43.000
because he always decided to look upon his oppressor

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:46.000
as also being a human being,

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:49.000
also being a human being.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:54.000
So he engaged a political process of dialogue,

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:57.000
not as a strategy of the weak,

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:00.000
but as a strategy of the strong.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.000
And he engaged talking profoundly

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.000
by settling some of the most tricky issues

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:08.000
through a truth and reconciliation process

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.000
where people came and talked.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.000
Now South African friends will know

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.000
that was very painful.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:17.000
So what can we learn from all of this?

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.000
Dialogue is not easy --

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:22.000
not between individuals, not between groups, not between governments --

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:25.000
but it is very necessary.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:29.000
If we're going to deal with political conflict-solving of conflicts,

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:32.000
if we're going to understand these new groups

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:35.000
which are coming from bottom-up,

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:38.000
supported by technology, which is available to all,

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:41.000
we diplomats cannot be sitting back in the banquets

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:44.000
believing that we are doing interstate relations.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.000
We have to connect

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.000
with these profound changes.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.000
And what is dialogue really about?

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.000
When I enter into dialogue,

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.000
I really hope that the other side

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.000
would pick up my points of view,

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.000
that I would impress upon them

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.000
my opinions and my values.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.000
I cannot do that

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.000
unless I send the signals that I will be open

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:07.000
to listen to the other side's signals.

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:10.000
We need a lot more training on how to do that

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.000
and a lot more practice

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:15.000
on how that can take problem-solving forward.

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:17.000
We know from our personal experiences

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.000
that it's easy sometimes

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.000
just to walk,

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:24.000
and sometimes you may need to fight.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:27.000
And I wouldn't say that is the wrong thing in all circumstances.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.000
Sometimes you have to.

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:32.000
But that strategy seldom takes you very far.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.000
The alternative is a strategy

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.000
of engagement and principled dialogue.

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:39.000
And I believe we need to strengthen this approach

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.000
in modern diplomacy,

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.000
not only between states,

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.000
but also within states.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.000
We are seeing some new signs.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.000
We could never have done

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.000
the convention against anti-personnel landmines

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:55.000
and the convention that is banning cluster munitions

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:58.000
unless we had done diplomacy differently,

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.000
by engaging with civil society.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.000
All of a sudden,

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:05.000
NGOs were not only standing in the streets, crying their slogans,

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:08.000
but they were taking [them] into the negotiations,

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:12.000
partly because they represented the victims of these weapons.

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.000
And they brought their knowledge.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.000
And there was an interaction

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:19.000
between diplomacy and the power coming bottom-up.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.000
This is perhaps a first element

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.000
of a change.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.000
In the future, I believe,

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:28.000
we should draw examples from these different illustrations,

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.000
not to have diplomacy

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:33.000
which is disconnected from people and civil society.

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:36.000
And we have to go also

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.000
beyond traditional diplomacy

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.000
to the survival issue of our times,

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:42.000
climate change.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:45.000
How are we going to solve climate change through negotiations,

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:48.000
unless we are able to make civil society and people,

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:51.000
not part of the problem, but part of the solution?

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:54.000
It is going to demand an inclusive process of diplomacy

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:57.000
very different from the one we are practicing today

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:00.000
as we are heading to new rounds of difficult climate negotiations,

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.000
but when we move toward something

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.000
which has to be much more

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.000
along a broad mobilization.

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:09.000
It's crucial to understand, I believe,

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:11.000
because of technology and because of globalization,

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.000
societies from bottom-up.

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:15.000
We as diplomats

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:17.000
need to know the social capital

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:19.000
of communities.

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:22.000
What is it that makes people trust each other,

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:24.000
not only between states,

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:26.000
but also within states?

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:29.000
What is the legitimacy of diplomacy,

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:32.000
of the the solution we devise as diplomats

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:35.000
if they cannot be reflected and understood

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:38.000
by also these broader forces of societies

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:42.000
that we now very loosely call groups?

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:45.000
The good thing is that we are not powerless.

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:47.000
We have never had

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:49.000
as many means of communication,

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:52.000
means of being connected, means of reaching out,

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.000
means of including.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.000
The diplomatic toolbox

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:59.000
is actually full of different tools we can use

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.000
to strengthen our communication.

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:04.000
But the problem is that we are coming out of a decade

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:06.000
where we had a fear of touching it.

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:09.000
Now, I hope, in the coming years,

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:12.000
that we are able to demonstrate through some concrete examples

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:15.000
that fear is receding

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:17.000
and that we can take courage

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:19.000
from that alliance

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:21.000
with civil society

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.000
in different countries

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:25.000
to support their problem-solving,

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:27.000
among the Afghans,

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:30.000
inside the Palestinian population,

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.000
between the peoples of Palestine and Israel.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:35.000
And as we try to understand this broad movement

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:37.000
across the Arab world,

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:39.000
we are not powerless.

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:41.000
We need to improve the necessary skills,

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:43.000
and we need the courage to use them.

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:45.000
In my country,

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:50.000
I have seen how the council of Islamist groups

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.000
and Christian groups

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:55.000
came together, not as a government initiative,

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.000
but they came together on their own initiative

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:59.000
to establish contact and dialogue

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:03.000
in times where things were pretty low-key tension.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:05.000
And when tension increased,

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:08.000
they already had that dialogue,

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:11.000
and that was a strength to deal with different issues.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:13.000
Our modern Western societies

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:15.000
are more complex than before,

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:17.000
in this time of migration.

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:20.000
How are we going to settle and build a bigger "We"

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:22.000
to deal with our issues

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:24.000
if we don't improve our skills of communication?

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.000
So there are many reasons,

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.000
and for all of these reasons,

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:31.000
this is time and this is why we must talk.

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:33.000
Thank you for your attention.

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:37.000
(Applause)
