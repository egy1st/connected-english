00:00:00.325 --> 00:00:05.642
What I'm going to show you
are the astonishing molecular machines

00:00:05.666 --> 00:00:08.966
that create the living
fabric of your body.

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:12.773
Now molecules are really, really tiny.

00:00:12.797 --> 00:00:15.677
And by tiny, I mean really.

00:00:16.645 --> 00:00:18.647
They're smaller
than a wavelength of light,

00:00:18.671 --> 00:00:20.976
so we have no way
to directly observe them.

00:00:21.751 --> 00:00:24.094
But through science,
we do have a fairly good idea

00:00:24.118 --> 00:00:26.330
of what's going on
down at the molecular scale.

00:00:26.799 --> 00:00:29.576
So what we can do is actually
tell you about the molecules,

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:32.837
but we don't really have a direct way
of showing you the molecules.

00:00:32.861 --> 00:00:35.111
One way around this is to draw pictures.

00:00:35.135 --> 00:00:37.675
And this idea is actually nothing new.

00:00:37.699 --> 00:00:39.987
Scientists have always created pictures

00:00:40.011 --> 00:00:42.797
as part of their thinking
and discovery process.

00:00:42.821 --> 00:00:45.696
They draw pictures
of what they're observing with their eyes,

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:48.112
through technology
like telescopes and microscopes,

00:00:48.136 --> 00:00:50.575
and also what they're thinking
about in their minds.

00:00:50.599 --> 00:00:52.202
I picked two well-known examples,

00:00:52.226 --> 00:00:55.831
because they're very well-known
for expressing science through art.

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:59.883
And I start with Galileo,
who used the world's first telescope

00:00:59.907 --> 00:01:01.093
to look at the Moon.

00:01:01.117 --> 00:01:03.424
And he transformed
our understanding of the Moon.

00:01:03.448 --> 00:01:05.081
The perception in the 17th century

00:01:05.105 --> 00:01:07.162
was the Moon was a perfect
heavenly sphere.

00:01:07.575 --> 00:01:10.559
But what Galileo saw
was a rocky, barren world,

00:01:10.583 --> 00:01:12.976
which he expressed
through his watercolor painting.

00:01:13.411 --> 00:01:16.209
Another scientist with very big ideas,

00:01:16.334 --> 00:01:18.858
the superstar of biology
is Charles Darwin.

00:01:18.882 --> 00:01:20.926
And with this famous entry
in his notebook,

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:23.790
he begins in the top left-hand
corner with, "I think,"

00:01:23.814 --> 00:01:26.521
and then sketches out
the first tree of life,

00:01:26.545 --> 00:01:29.475
which is his perception
of how all the species,

00:01:29.499 --> 00:01:33.357
all living things on Earth are connected
through evolutionary history --

00:01:33.381 --> 00:01:35.628
the origin of species
through natural selection

00:01:35.652 --> 00:01:37.976
and divergence
from an ancestral population.

00:01:38.515 --> 00:01:39.976
Even as a scientist,

00:01:40.388 --> 00:01:42.901
I used to go to lectures
by molecular biologists

00:01:42.925 --> 00:01:45.650
and find them completely incomprehensible,

00:01:45.674 --> 00:01:47.942
with all the fancy technical
language and jargon

00:01:47.966 --> 00:01:50.090
that they would use
in describing their work,

00:01:50.114 --> 00:01:53.165
until I encountered
the artworks of David Goodsell,

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:55.930
who is a molecular biologist
at the Scripps Institute.

00:01:55.954 --> 00:01:59.523
And his pictures -- everything's accurate
and it's all to scale.

00:01:59.547 --> 00:02:01.976
And his work illuminated for me

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.315
what the molecular world
inside us is like.

00:02:04.815 --> 00:02:06.840
So this is a transection through blood.

00:02:06.864 --> 00:02:09.841
In the top left-hand corner,
you've got this yellow-green area.

00:02:09.865 --> 00:02:13.081
The yellow-green area is the fluid
of blood, which is mostly water,

00:02:13.105 --> 00:02:16.092
but it's also antibodies, sugars,
hormones, that kind of thing.

00:02:16.116 --> 00:02:18.604
And the red region is a slice
into a red blood cell.

00:02:18.628 --> 00:02:20.494
And those red molecules are hemoglobin.

00:02:20.518 --> 00:02:23.213
They are actually red;
that's what gives blood its color.

00:02:23.237 --> 00:02:25.204
And hemoglobin acts as a molecular sponge

00:02:25.228 --> 00:02:26.905
to soak up the oxygen in your lungs

00:02:26.929 --> 00:02:29.042
and then carry it
to other parts of the body.

00:02:29.066 --> 00:02:31.598
I was very much inspired
by this image many years ago,

00:02:31.622 --> 00:02:34.173
and I wondered whether
we could use computer graphics

00:02:34.197 --> 00:02:35.801
to represent the molecular world.

00:02:35.825 --> 00:02:36.976
What would it look like?

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.440
And that's how I really began.

00:02:38.863 --> 00:02:40.476
So let's begin.

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:42.885
This is DNA in its classic
double helix form.

00:02:42.909 --> 00:02:46.265
And it's from X-ray crystallography,
so it's an accurate model of DNA.

00:02:46.289 --> 00:02:49.260
If we unwind the double helix
and unzip the two strands,

00:02:49.284 --> 00:02:51.303
you see these things that look like teeth.

00:02:51.327 --> 00:02:53.144
Those are the letters of genetic code,

00:02:53.168 --> 00:02:55.437
the 25,000 genes
you've got written in your DNA.

00:02:55.461 --> 00:02:58.397
This is what they typically talk about --
the genetic code --

00:02:58.421 --> 00:03:00.112
this is what they're talking about.

00:03:00.136 --> 00:03:02.906
But I want to talk about
a different aspect of DNA science,

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:04.819
and that is the physical nature of DNA.

00:03:04.843 --> 00:03:07.428
It's these two strands
that run in opposite directions

00:03:07.452 --> 00:03:09.622
for reasons I can't go into right now.

00:03:09.646 --> 00:03:11.854
But they physically run
in opposite directions,

00:03:11.878 --> 00:03:15.509
which creates a number of complications
for your living cells,

00:03:15.533 --> 00:03:16.762
as you're about to see,

00:03:16.786 --> 00:03:19.148
most particularly
when DNA is being copied.

00:03:19.172 --> 00:03:21.090
And so what I'm about to show you

00:03:21.114 --> 00:03:25.130
is an accurate representation
of the actual DNA replication machine

00:03:25.154 --> 00:03:27.211
that's occurring right now
inside your body,

00:03:27.235 --> 00:03:29.047
at least 2002 biology.

00:03:29.357 --> 00:03:32.368
So DNA's entering the production line
from the left-hand side,

00:03:32.734 --> 00:03:35.901
and it hits this collection,
these miniature biochemical machines,

00:03:35.925 --> 00:03:39.069
that are pulling apart the DNA strand
and making an exact copy.

00:03:39.093 --> 00:03:42.602
So DNA comes in and hits this blue,
doughnut-shaped structure

00:03:42.626 --> 00:03:44.933
and it's ripped apart
into its two strands.

00:03:45.419 --> 00:03:47.043
One strand can be copied directly,

00:03:47.067 --> 00:03:49.990
and you can see these things
spooling off to the bottom there.

00:03:50.014 --> 00:03:52.274
But things aren't so simple
for the other strand

00:03:52.298 --> 00:03:54.063
because it must be copied backwards.

00:03:54.087 --> 00:03:56.197
So it's thrown out
repeatedly in these loops

00:03:56.221 --> 00:04:00.265
and copied one section at a time,
creating two new DNA molecules.

00:04:00.289 --> 00:04:05.572
Now you have billions of this machine
right now working away inside you,

00:04:05.596 --> 00:04:07.813
copying your DNA with exquisite fidelity.

00:04:08.676 --> 00:04:10.210
It's an accurate representation,

00:04:10.234 --> 00:04:13.763
and it's pretty much at the correct speed
for what is occurring inside you.

00:04:13.787 --> 00:04:16.604
I've left out error correction
and a bunch of other things.

00:04:16.628 --> 00:04:18.387
(Laughter)

00:04:18.411 --> 00:04:20.532
This was work from a number of years ago--

00:04:20.556 --> 00:04:21.725
Thank you.

00:04:21.749 --> 00:04:23.121
(Applause)

00:04:23.145 --> 00:04:25.074
This is work from a number of years ago,

00:04:25.098 --> 00:04:27.365
but what I'll show you next
is updated science,

00:04:27.389 --> 00:04:28.551
it's updated technology.

00:04:28.575 --> 00:04:29.935
So again, we begin with DNA.

00:04:29.959 --> 00:04:31.677
And it's jiggling and wiggling there

00:04:31.701 --> 00:04:33.882
because of the surrounding
soup of molecules,

00:04:33.906 --> 00:04:36.289
which I've stripped away
so you can see something.

00:04:36.313 --> 00:04:39.288
DNA is about two nanometers across,
which is really quite tiny.

00:04:39.312 --> 00:04:40.746
But in each one of your cells,

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:43.947
each strand of DNA is about
30 to 40 million nanometers long.

00:04:44.414 --> 00:04:48.230
So to keep the DNA organized
and regulate access to the genetic code,

00:04:48.254 --> 00:04:50.337
it's wrapped around these
purple proteins --

00:04:50.361 --> 00:04:51.943
or I've labeled them purple here.

00:04:51.967 --> 00:04:53.551
It's packaged up and bundled up.

00:04:53.575 --> 00:04:55.976
All this field of view
is a single strand of DNA.

00:04:56.511 --> 00:04:59.593
This huge package of DNA
is called a chromosome.

00:04:59.617 --> 00:05:01.976
And we'll come back
to chromosomes in a minute.

00:05:02.415 --> 00:05:04.481
We're pulling out, we're zooming out,

00:05:04.505 --> 00:05:05.976
out through a nuclear pore,

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.660
which is the gateway to this compartment
that holds all the DNA,

00:05:09.684 --> 00:05:11.103
called the nucleus.

00:05:11.657 --> 00:05:15.888
All of this field of view
is about a semester's worth of biology,

00:05:15.912 --> 00:05:17.277
and I've got seven minutes,

00:05:17.301 --> 00:05:19.989
So we're not going to be
able to do that today?

00:05:20.013 --> 00:05:21.975
No, I'm being told, "No."

00:05:22.416 --> 00:05:25.781
This is the way a living cell
looks down a light microscope.

00:05:25.805 --> 00:05:29.303
And it's been filmed under time-lapse,
which is why you can see it moving.

00:05:29.327 --> 00:05:30.908
The nuclear envelope breaks down.

00:05:30.932 --> 00:05:33.177
These sausage-shaped things
are the chromosomes,

00:05:33.201 --> 00:05:34.382
and we'll focus on them.

00:05:34.406 --> 00:05:38.444
They go through this very striking motion
that is focused on these little red spots.

00:05:39.068 --> 00:05:43.303
When the cell feels it's ready to go,
it rips apart the chromosome.

00:05:43.327 --> 00:05:45.368
One set of DNA goes to one side,

00:05:45.392 --> 00:05:47.415
the other side gets
the other set of DNA --

00:05:47.439 --> 00:05:49.276
identical copies of DNA.

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:51.260
And then the cell splits down the middle.

00:05:51.284 --> 00:05:54.143
And again, you have billions of cells
undergoing this process

00:05:54.167 --> 00:05:55.524
right now inside of you.

00:05:56.342 --> 00:05:59.198
Now we're going to rewind
and just focus on the chromosomes,

00:05:59.222 --> 00:06:01.464
and look at its structure and describe it.

00:06:01.988 --> 00:06:04.413
So again, here we are
at that equator moment.

00:06:05.394 --> 00:06:06.594
The chromosomes line up.

00:06:06.618 --> 00:06:08.445
And if we isolate just one chromosome,

00:06:08.469 --> 00:06:11.286
we're going to pull it out
and have a look at its structure.

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:14.372
So this is one of the biggest
molecular structures that you have,

00:06:14.396 --> 00:06:17.451
at least as far as we've discovered
so far inside of us.

00:06:18.026 --> 00:06:20.002
So this is a single chromosome.

00:06:20.026 --> 00:06:22.627
And you have two strands of DNA
in each chromosome.

00:06:22.651 --> 00:06:24.372
One is bundled up into one sausage.

00:06:24.396 --> 00:06:27.129
The other strand is bundled up
into the other sausage.

00:06:27.153 --> 00:06:30.715
These things that look like whiskers
that are sticking out from either side

00:06:30.739 --> 00:06:32.645
are the dynamic scaffolding of the cell.

00:06:32.669 --> 00:06:35.580
They're called microtubules,
that name's not important.

00:06:35.604 --> 00:06:38.335
But we're going to focus on
the region labeled red here --

00:06:38.359 --> 00:06:40.896
and it's the interface between
the dynamic scaffolding

00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:42.087
and the chromosomes.

00:06:42.111 --> 00:06:45.216
It is obviously central
to the movement of the chromosomes.

00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:48.812
We have no idea, really,
as to how it's achieving that movement.

00:06:48.836 --> 00:06:51.483
We've been studying this thing
they call the kinetochore

00:06:51.507 --> 00:06:53.579
for over a hundred years
with intense study,

00:06:53.603 --> 00:06:56.429
and we're still just beginning
to discover what it's about.

00:06:56.453 --> 00:06:59.207
It is made up of about
200 different types of proteins,

00:06:59.231 --> 00:07:00.942
thousands of proteins in total.

00:07:01.730 --> 00:07:04.550
It is a signal broadcasting system.

00:07:04.574 --> 00:07:06.738
It broadcasts through chemical signals,

00:07:06.762 --> 00:07:09.506
telling the rest of the cell
when it's ready,

00:07:09.530 --> 00:07:12.361
when it feels that everything
is aligned and ready to go

00:07:12.385 --> 00:07:14.363
for the separation of the chromosomes.

00:07:14.387 --> 00:07:17.719
It is able to couple onto the growing
and shrinking microtubules.

00:07:17.743 --> 00:07:20.942
It's involved with the growing
of the microtubules,

00:07:20.966 --> 00:07:23.369
and it's able to transiently
couple onto them.

00:07:24.099 --> 00:07:25.919
It's also an attention-sensing system.

00:07:25.943 --> 00:07:27.919
It's able to feel when the cell is ready,

00:07:27.943 --> 00:07:30.177
when the chromosome
is correctly positioned.

00:07:30.201 --> 00:07:34.014
It's turning green here because it feels
that everything is just right.

00:07:34.038 --> 00:07:36.296
And you'll see,
there's this one little last bit

00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:37.753
that's still remaining red.

00:07:37.777 --> 00:07:40.310
And it's walked away
down the microtubules.

00:07:41.889 --> 00:07:45.068
That is the signal broadcasting system
sending out the stop signal.

00:07:45.092 --> 00:07:47.788
And it's walked away --
I mean, it's that mechanical.

00:07:47.812 --> 00:07:49.380
It's molecular clockwork.

00:07:49.404 --> 00:07:51.976
This is how you work
at the molecular scale.

00:07:52.609 --> 00:07:54.873
So with a little bit
of molecular eye candy,

00:07:54.897 --> 00:07:56.095
(Laughter)

00:07:56.119 --> 00:07:58.069
we've got kinesins, the orange ones.

00:07:58.093 --> 00:08:00.866
They're little molecular courier
molecules walking one way.

00:08:00.890 --> 00:08:04.036
And here are the dynein,
they're carrying that broadcasting system.

00:08:04.060 --> 00:08:05.604
And they've got their long legs

00:08:05.628 --> 00:08:07.694
so they can step around
obstacles and so on.

00:08:07.718 --> 00:08:10.745
So again, this is all derived
accurately from the science.

00:08:10.769 --> 00:08:13.319
The problem is we can't show it
to you any other way.

00:08:13.343 --> 00:08:18.177
Exploring at the frontier of science,
at the frontier of human understanding,

00:08:18.201 --> 00:08:19.436
is mind-blowing.

00:08:20.714 --> 00:08:21.892
Discovering this stuff

00:08:21.916 --> 00:08:25.444
is certainly a pleasurable
incentive to work in science.

00:08:25.960 --> 00:08:27.688
But most medical researchers --

00:08:28.641 --> 00:08:32.854
discovering the stuff is simply steps
along the path to the big goals,

00:08:32.878 --> 00:08:37.299
which are to eradicate disease,
to eliminate the suffering

00:08:37.323 --> 00:08:39.398
and the misery that disease causes

00:08:39.422 --> 00:08:41.102
and to lift people out of poverty.

00:08:41.126 --> 00:08:42.398
Thank you.

00:08:42.422 --> 00:08:47.619
(Applause)
