00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
♫ They stood together ♫

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
♫ under a tree in tall grass ♫

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000

♫ We will be left to wander ♫

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
♫ and fade away ♫

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
♫ Soldiers came and took our husbands ♫

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
♫ at the break of day ♫

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
♫ We will live on ♫

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
♫ then fade away ♫

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
♫ Soldiers came and killed our children ♫

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
