00:00:00.396 --> 00:00:03.285
Nearly everyone in the world
is part of some community,

00:00:03.309 --> 00:00:04.952
whether large or small.

00:00:04.976 --> 00:00:07.998
And all of these communities
have similar needs.

00:00:08.022 --> 00:00:09.202
They need light,

00:00:09.226 --> 00:00:10.390
they need heat

00:00:10.414 --> 00:00:11.760
they need air-conditioning.

00:00:11.784 --> 00:00:14.979
People can't function very well
when it's too hot or too cold.

00:00:15.003 --> 00:00:19.449
They need food to be grown or provided,
distributed and stored safely.

00:00:19.473 --> 00:00:23.553
They need waste products to be collected,
removed and processed.

00:00:23.577 --> 00:00:27.004
People in the community need to be able
to get from one place to another

00:00:27.028 --> 00:00:28.202
as quickly as possible.

00:00:28.226 --> 00:00:31.548
And a supply of energy is the basis
for all of these activities.

00:00:31.572 --> 00:00:34.902
Energy in the form of electricity
provides light and air-conditioning.

00:00:34.926 --> 00:00:36.900
Energy in the form of heat keeps us warm.

00:00:36.924 --> 00:00:39.970
And energy in chemical
form provides fertilizer;

00:00:39.994 --> 00:00:42.799
it drives farm machinery
and transportation energy.

00:00:42.823 --> 00:00:44.793
Now, I spent 10 years working at NASA.

00:00:44.817 --> 00:00:47.528
In the beginning of my time there in 2000,

00:00:47.552 --> 00:00:49.552
I was very interested in communities.

00:00:49.576 --> 00:00:52.211
But this is the kind of community
I was thinking of --

00:00:52.235 --> 00:00:53.476
a lunar community

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:56.802
It had all of the same needs
as a community on Earth would have,

00:00:56.826 --> 00:00:59.378
but it had some very unique constraints.

00:00:59.402 --> 00:01:01.933
And we had to think about
how we would provide energy

00:01:01.957 --> 00:01:03.475
for this very unique community.

00:01:03.499 --> 00:01:04.971
There’s no coal on the Moon.

00:01:04.995 --> 00:01:06.333
There's no petroleum.

00:01:06.357 --> 00:01:08.034
There’s no natural gas.

00:01:08.058 --> 00:01:09.241
There's no atmosphere.

00:01:09.265 --> 00:01:10.526
There’s no wind, either.

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:12.604
And solar power had a real problem:

00:01:12.628 --> 00:01:15.115
the Moon orbits the Earth once a month.

00:01:15.139 --> 00:01:17.140
For two weeks, the sun goes down,

00:01:17.164 --> 00:01:19.378
and your solar panels
don't make any energy.

00:01:19.402 --> 00:01:22.670
If you want to try to store
enough energy in batteries for two weeks,

00:01:22.694 --> 00:01:24.187
it just simply isn't practical.

00:01:24.211 --> 00:01:26.335
So nuclear energy
was really the only choice.

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:29.742
Now, back in 2000, I didn't really know
too much about nuclear power,

00:01:29.766 --> 00:01:31.156
so I started trying to learn.

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:34.536
Almost all of the nuclear power
we use on Earth today uses water

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:35.846
as a basic coolant.

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:38.920
This has some advantages,
but it has a lot of disadvantages.

00:01:38.944 --> 00:01:42.542
If you want to generate electricity,
you have to get the water a lot hotter

00:01:42.566 --> 00:01:43.732
than you normally can.

00:01:43.756 --> 00:01:47.255
At normal pressures, water will boil
at 100 degrees Celsius.

00:01:47.279 --> 00:01:51.005
This isn't nearly hot enough
to generate electricity effectively.

00:01:51.029 --> 00:01:54.320
So water-cooled reactors have to run
at much higher pressures

00:01:54.344 --> 00:01:55.836
than atmospheric pressure.

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:59.955
Some water-cooled reactors run
at over 70 atmospheres of pressure,

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:03.614
and others have to run at as much as
150 atmospheres of pressure.

00:02:03.638 --> 00:02:05.131
There's no getting around this;

00:02:05.155 --> 00:02:08.363
it's simply what you have to do
if you want to generate electricity

00:02:08.387 --> 00:02:09.795
using a water-cooled reactor.

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:12.308
This means you have to build
a water-cooled reactor

00:02:12.332 --> 00:02:13.491
as a pressure vessel,

00:02:13.515 --> 00:02:15.889
with steel walls
over 20 centimeters thick.

00:02:15.913 --> 00:02:18.175
If that sounds heavy,
that's because it is.

00:02:18.199 --> 00:02:20.387
Things get a lot worse
if you have an accident

00:02:20.411 --> 00:02:22.484
where you lose pressure
inside the reactor.

00:02:22.508 --> 00:02:25.346
If you have liquid water
at 300 degrees Celsius

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:27.043
and suddenly you depressurize it,

00:02:27.067 --> 00:02:28.857
it doesn't stay liquid for very long;

00:02:28.881 --> 00:02:30.083
it flashes into steam.

00:02:30.107 --> 00:02:34.077
So water-cooled reactors are built
inside of big, thick concrete buildings

00:02:34.101 --> 00:02:35.529
called containment buildings,

00:02:35.553 --> 00:02:39.103
which are meant to hold all of the steam
that would come out of the reactor

00:02:39.127 --> 00:02:41.348
if you had an accident
where you lost pressure.

00:02:41.372 --> 00:02:45.097
Steam takes up about 1,000 times
more volume than liquid water,

00:02:45.121 --> 00:02:47.611
so the containment building
ends up being very large,

00:02:47.635 --> 00:02:49.361
relative to the size of the reactor.

00:02:49.385 --> 00:02:51.561
Another bad thing happens
if you lose pressure

00:02:51.585 --> 00:02:53.119
and your water flashes to steam.

00:02:53.143 --> 00:02:56.098
If you don't get emergency coolant
to the fuel in the reactor,

00:02:56.122 --> 00:02:57.560
it can overheat and melt.

00:02:57.584 --> 00:03:01.388
The reactors we have today
use uranium oxide as a fuel.

00:03:01.412 --> 00:03:03.776
It's a ceramic material
similar in performance

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:06.753
to the ceramics we use to make
coffee cups or cookware

00:03:06.777 --> 00:03:08.893
or the bricks we use to line fireplaces.

00:03:08.917 --> 00:03:10.178
They're chemically stable,

00:03:10.202 --> 00:03:12.408
but they're not very good
at transferring heat.

00:03:12.432 --> 00:03:14.459
If you lose pressure, you lose your water,

00:03:14.483 --> 00:03:16.082
and soon your fuel will melt down

00:03:16.106 --> 00:03:18.707
and release the radioactive
fission products within it.

00:03:18.731 --> 00:03:21.836
Making solid nuclear fuel
is a complicated and expensive process.

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:25.392
And we extract less than one percent
of the energy for the nuclear fuel

00:03:25.416 --> 00:03:27.572
before it can no longer
remain in the reactor.

00:03:27.596 --> 00:03:30.332
Water-cooled reactors have
another additional challenge:

00:03:30.356 --> 00:03:32.661
they need to be near
large bodies of water,

00:03:32.685 --> 00:03:35.474
where the steam they generate
can be cooled and condensed.

00:03:35.498 --> 00:03:37.760
Otherwise, they can't generate
electrical power.

00:03:37.784 --> 00:03:39.886
Now, there's no lakes
or rivers on the Moon,

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:42.719
so if all of this makes it sound
like water-cooled reactors

00:03:42.743 --> 00:03:44.846
aren't such a good fit
for a lunar community,

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:46.359
I would tend to agree with you.

00:03:46.383 --> 00:03:47.434
(Laughter)

00:03:47.458 --> 00:03:50.928
I had the good fortune to learn about
a different form of nuclear power

00:03:50.952 --> 00:03:52.727
that doesn't have all these problems,

00:03:52.751 --> 00:03:53.983
for a very simple reason:

00:03:54.007 --> 00:03:57.064
it's not based on water-cooling,
and it doesn't use solid fuel.

00:03:57.088 --> 00:03:59.306
Surprisingly, it's based on salt.

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:01.416
One day, I was at a friend's
office at work,

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:04.297
and I noticed this book on the shelf,
"Fluid Fuel Reactors."

00:04:04.321 --> 00:04:06.782
I was interested
and asked him if I could borrow it.

00:04:06.806 --> 00:04:09.784
Inside that book, I learned
about research in the United States

00:04:09.808 --> 00:04:10.975
back in the 1950s,

00:04:10.999 --> 00:04:13.556
into a kind of reactor
that wasn't based on solid fuel

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:14.751
or on water-cooling.

00:04:14.775 --> 00:04:17.440
It didn't have the problems
of the water-cooled reactor,

00:04:17.464 --> 00:04:19.213
and the reason why was pretty neat.

00:04:19.237 --> 00:04:22.448
It used a mixture of fluoride salts
as a nuclear fuel,

00:04:22.472 --> 00:04:25.891
specifically, the fluorides of lithium,
beryllium, uranium and thorium.

00:04:25.915 --> 00:04:28.306
Fluoride salts are remarkably
chemically stable.

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:30.519
They do not react with air and water.

00:04:30.543 --> 00:04:33.392
You have to heat them up
to about 400 degrees Celsius

00:04:33.416 --> 00:04:34.570
to get them to melt.

00:04:34.594 --> 00:04:37.237
But that's actually perfect
for trying to generate power

00:04:37.261 --> 00:04:38.415
in a nuclear reactor.

00:04:38.439 --> 00:04:39.600
Here's the real magic:

00:04:39.624 --> 00:04:41.903
they don't have to operate
at high pressure.

00:04:41.927 --> 00:04:44.058
And that makes the biggest
difference of all.

00:04:44.082 --> 00:04:47.550
This means they don't have to be
in heavy, thick steel pressure vessels,

00:04:47.574 --> 00:04:49.502
they don't have to use water for coolant

00:04:49.526 --> 00:04:51.155
and there's nothing in the reactor

00:04:51.179 --> 00:04:53.899
that's going to make
a big change in density, like water.

00:04:53.923 --> 00:04:56.084
So the containment building
around the reactor

00:04:56.108 --> 00:04:57.967
can be much smaller and close-fitting.

00:04:57.991 --> 00:05:01.162
Unlike the solid fuels that can melt down
if you stop cooling them,

00:05:01.186 --> 00:05:03.401
these liquid fluoride fuels
are already melted,

00:05:03.425 --> 00:05:05.066
at a much, much lower temperature.

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:07.381
In normal operation,
you have a little plug here

00:05:07.405 --> 00:05:09.121
at the bottom of the reactor vessel.

00:05:09.145 --> 00:05:11.745
This plug is made
out of a piece of frozen salt

00:05:11.769 --> 00:05:13.795
that you've kept frozen
by blowing cool gas

00:05:13.819 --> 00:05:15.209
over the outside of the pipe.

00:05:15.233 --> 00:05:17.874
If there's an emergency
and you lose all the power

00:05:17.898 --> 00:05:19.276
to your nuclear power plant,

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:20.980
the little blower stops blowing,

00:05:21.004 --> 00:05:22.792
the frozen plug of salt melts,

00:05:22.816 --> 00:05:25.180
and the liquid fluoride fuel
inside the reactor

00:05:25.204 --> 00:05:27.235
drains out of the vessel, through the line

00:05:27.259 --> 00:05:29.369
and into another vessel
called a drain tank.

00:05:29.393 --> 00:05:33.279
Inside the drain tank, it's all configured
to maximize the transfer of heat,

00:05:33.303 --> 00:05:35.600
so as to keep the salt passively cooled

00:05:35.624 --> 00:05:37.496
as its heat load drops over time.

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:39.177
In water-cooled reactors,

00:05:39.201 --> 00:05:41.466
you generally have to provide
power to the plant

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:44.178
to keep the water circulating
and to prevent a meltdown,

00:05:44.202 --> 00:05:45.621
as we saw in Japan.

00:05:45.645 --> 00:05:48.885
But in this reactor,
if you lose the power to the reactor,

00:05:48.909 --> 00:05:52.170
it shuts itself down all by itself,
without human intervention,

00:05:52.194 --> 00:05:54.814
and puts itself in a safe
and controlled configuration.

00:05:54.838 --> 00:05:56.822
Now, this was sounding pretty good to me,

00:05:56.846 --> 00:06:00.260
and I was excited about the potential
of using a liquid fluoride reactor

00:06:00.284 --> 00:06:01.609
to power a lunar community.

00:06:01.633 --> 00:06:04.662
But then I learned about thorium,
and the story got even better.

00:06:04.686 --> 00:06:06.809
Thorium is a naturally
occurring nuclear fuel

00:06:06.833 --> 00:06:09.898
that is four times more common
in the Earth's crust than uranium.

00:06:09.922 --> 00:06:12.351
It can be used in liquid fluoride
thorium reactors

00:06:12.375 --> 00:06:15.958
to produce electrical energy, heat
and other valuable products.

00:06:15.982 --> 00:06:19.730
It's so energy-dense that you could hold
a lifetime supply of thorium energy

00:06:19.754 --> 00:06:20.996
in the palm of your hand.

00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:23.568
Thorium is also common on the Moon
and easy to find.

00:06:23.592 --> 00:06:26.647
Here's an actual map of where
the lunar thorium is located.

00:06:26.671 --> 00:06:29.887
Thorium has an electromagnetic signature
that makes it easy to find,

00:06:29.911 --> 00:06:31.072
even from a spacecraft.

00:06:31.096 --> 00:06:34.189
With the energy generated
from a liquid fluoride thorium reactor,

00:06:34.213 --> 00:06:36.904
we could recycle all of the air,
water and waste products

00:06:36.928 --> 00:06:38.234
within the lunar community.

00:06:38.258 --> 00:06:41.229
In fact, doing so would be
an absolute requirement for success.

00:06:41.253 --> 00:06:44.467
We could grow the crops needed
to feed the members of the community

00:06:44.491 --> 00:06:46.313
even during the two-week lunar night,

00:06:46.337 --> 00:06:48.254
using light and power from the reactor.

00:06:48.278 --> 00:06:51.130
It seemed like the liquid fluoride
thorium reactor, or LFTR,

00:06:51.154 --> 00:06:54.623
could be the power source that could make
a self-sustainable lunar colony

00:06:54.647 --> 00:06:55.806
a reality.

00:06:55.830 --> 00:06:57.180
But I had a simple question:

00:06:57.204 --> 00:06:59.899
If it was such a great thing
for a community on the Moon,

00:06:59.923 --> 00:07:02.733
why not a community on the Earth,
a community of the future,

00:07:02.757 --> 00:07:04.779
self-sustaining and energy-independent?

00:07:04.803 --> 00:07:07.968
The same energy generation
and recycling techniques

00:07:07.992 --> 00:07:11.038
that could have a powerful impact
on surviving on the Moon

00:07:11.062 --> 00:07:14.112
could also have a powerful impact
on surviving on the Earth.

00:07:14.136 --> 00:07:15.934
Right now, we're burning fossil fuels

00:07:15.958 --> 00:07:18.258
because they're easy to find
and because we can.

00:07:18.282 --> 00:07:21.999
Unfortunately, they're making some parts
of our planet look like the Moon.

00:07:22.023 --> 00:07:24.409
Using fossil fuels
entangles us in conflict

00:07:24.433 --> 00:07:26.041
in unstable regions of the world

00:07:26.065 --> 00:07:27.978
and costs money and lives.

00:07:28.002 --> 00:07:30.636
Things could be very different
if we were using thorium.

00:07:30.660 --> 00:07:34.119
You see, in a LFTR, we could use thorium
about 200 times more efficiently

00:07:34.143 --> 00:07:35.584
than we're using uranium now.

00:07:35.608 --> 00:07:38.642
And because the LFTR is capable
of almost completely releasing

00:07:38.666 --> 00:07:39.828
the energy in thorium,

00:07:39.852 --> 00:07:43.946
this reduces the waste generated
over uranium by factors of hundreds,

00:07:43.970 --> 00:07:46.580
and by factors of millions
over fossil fuels.

00:07:46.604 --> 00:07:49.751
We're still going to need liquid fuels
for vehicles and machinery,

00:07:49.775 --> 00:07:53.659
but we could generate these liquid fuels
from the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere

00:07:53.683 --> 00:07:55.512
and from water, much like nature does.

00:07:55.536 --> 00:07:57.673
We could generate hydrogen
by splitting water

00:07:57.697 --> 00:08:01.156
and combining it with carbon
harvested from CO2 in the atmosphere,

00:08:01.180 --> 00:08:04.712
making fuels like methanol,
ammonia, and dimethyl ether,

00:08:04.736 --> 00:08:07.271
which could be a direct replacement
for diesel fuels.

00:08:07.295 --> 00:08:10.455
Imagine carbon-neutral
gasoline and diesel,

00:08:10.479 --> 00:08:12.922
sustainable and self-produced.

00:08:12.946 --> 00:08:14.301
Do we have enough thorium?

00:08:14.325 --> 00:08:15.480
Yes, we do.

00:08:15.504 --> 00:08:19.467
In fact, in the United States, we have
over 3,200 metric tons of thorium

00:08:19.491 --> 00:08:21.267
that was stockpiled 50 years ago

00:08:21.291 --> 00:08:23.838
and is currently buried
in a shallow trench in Nevada.

00:08:23.862 --> 00:08:26.103
This thorium, if used in LFTRs,

00:08:26.127 --> 00:08:29.766
could produce almost as much energy
as the United States uses in three years.

00:08:29.790 --> 00:08:31.993
And thorium is not
a rare substance, either.

00:08:32.017 --> 00:08:34.116
There are many sites
like this one in Idaho,

00:08:34.140 --> 00:08:38.023
where an area the size of a football field
would produce enough thorium each year

00:08:38.047 --> 00:08:39.323
to power the entire world.

00:08:39.347 --> 00:08:41.312
Using liquid fluoride thorium technology,

00:08:41.336 --> 00:08:44.234
we could move away from
expensive and difficult aspects

00:08:44.258 --> 00:08:47.097
of current water-cooled, solid-fueled
uranium nuclear power.

00:08:47.121 --> 00:08:50.015
We wouldn't need large,
high-pressure nuclear reactors

00:08:50.039 --> 00:08:52.197
and big containment buildings
that they go in.

00:08:52.221 --> 00:08:54.829
We wouldn't need large,
low-efficiency steam turbines.

00:08:54.853 --> 00:08:56.039
We wouldn't need to have

00:08:56.063 --> 00:08:58.751
as many long-distance power
transmission infrastructure,

00:08:58.775 --> 00:09:01.234
because thorium is
a very portable energy source

00:09:01.258 --> 00:09:03.564
that can be located
near to where it is needed.

00:09:03.588 --> 00:09:06.803
A liquid fluoride thorium reactor
would be a compact facility,

00:09:06.827 --> 00:09:08.769
very energy-efficient and safe,

00:09:08.793 --> 00:09:11.269
that would produce the energy
we need day and night,

00:09:11.293 --> 00:09:13.349
and without respect to weather conditions.

00:09:13.373 --> 00:09:16.347
In 2007, we used
five billion tons of coal,

00:09:16.371 --> 00:09:18.085
31 billion barrels of oil

00:09:18.109 --> 00:09:20.342
and five trillion cubic meters
of natural gas,

00:09:20.366 --> 00:09:23.444
along with 65,000 tons of uranium

00:09:23.468 --> 00:09:25.351
to produce the world's energy.

00:09:25.375 --> 00:09:27.314
With thorium, we could do the same thing

00:09:27.338 --> 00:09:30.574
with 7,000 tons of thorium
that could be mined at a single site.

00:09:30.598 --> 00:09:34.134
If all this sounds interesting to you,
I invite you to visit our website,

00:09:34.158 --> 00:09:37.444
where a growing and enthusiastic
online community of thorium advocates

00:09:37.468 --> 00:09:41.152
is working to tell the world
about how we can realize a clean, safe

00:09:41.176 --> 00:09:42.920
and sustainable energy future,

00:09:42.944 --> 00:09:44.539
based on the energies of thorium.

00:09:44.563 --> 00:09:46.277
Thank you very much.
