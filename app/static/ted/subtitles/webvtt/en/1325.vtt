00:00:01.720 --> 00:00:05.935
Music is the most universal
language that we have,

00:00:05.959 --> 00:00:09.165
way more so than any dialect or tongue.

00:00:09.802 --> 00:00:12.646
You can play a melody to a child in China

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:15.552
and the same melody
to a child in South Africa.

00:00:16.072 --> 00:00:19.704
And despite the huge differences
between those two children,

00:00:19.728 --> 00:00:23.946
they will still draw some of the same
truths from that melody.

00:00:24.739 --> 00:00:28.367
Now, I think the reason why
music has this universality,

00:00:28.391 --> 00:00:31.617
this way of speaking
to each and every one of us,

00:00:31.641 --> 00:00:35.635
is that somehow it's capable
of holding up a mirror to us

00:00:35.659 --> 00:00:38.966
that reveals, in some small or large way,

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:42.690
a little bit of who or what we are.

00:00:43.967 --> 00:00:45.736
By logical extension of this,

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:48.382
if music is this universal force,

00:00:48.406 --> 00:00:52.326
then surely groups of musicians --
let's call them orchestras --

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.214
should reflect every aspect
of the community.

00:00:56.893 --> 00:01:00.269
Logical, but not necessarily true.

00:01:00.293 --> 00:01:03.719
At TEDxBrussels today, we've been looking
forward to the future --

00:01:03.743 --> 00:01:04.894
50 years from now.

00:01:04.918 --> 00:01:08.237
Well, I'm going to ask you
to go in the other direction for a minute,

00:01:08.261 --> 00:01:10.404
to come back with me
50 years into the past,

00:01:10.428 --> 00:01:12.549
the early 1960s to be precise.

00:01:12.573 --> 00:01:15.047
And if you took a look
at all the great orchestras

00:01:15.071 --> 00:01:17.815
of the world at that time, a snapshot,

00:01:17.839 --> 00:01:20.253
how many women do you think you would find

00:01:20.277 --> 00:01:22.025
playing in those orchestras?

00:01:22.956 --> 00:01:25.642
The answer: virtually none.

00:01:26.356 --> 00:01:30.055
Well, here we are 50 years on, in 2011,

00:01:30.079 --> 00:01:32.232
and pretty much
every orchestra on the planet

00:01:32.256 --> 00:01:35.936
has a fantastic and healthy balance
between the sexes.

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:39.903
"Of course!" I hear you
say, "Totally logical."

00:01:40.652 --> 00:01:43.069
But how about another aspect
of the community?

00:01:43.093 --> 00:01:44.514
The disabled community.

00:01:45.189 --> 00:01:50.198
Do we find them well-represented
in the great orchestras of our world?

00:01:50.723 --> 00:01:52.715
Well, I can tell you as a conductor,

00:01:52.739 --> 00:01:55.719
I work with orchestras
around the world all the time,

00:01:55.743 --> 00:01:59.087
and I can count on the fingers of one hand

00:01:59.111 --> 00:02:01.435
the number of disabled
musicians I've encountered

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:03.025
in any orchestra,

00:02:03.049 --> 00:02:04.219
anywhere.

00:02:05.008 --> 00:02:06.242
Why is this?

00:02:06.837 --> 00:02:10.511
You can't tell me that there
aren't millions upon millions

00:02:10.535 --> 00:02:16.558
of prodigiously gifted musicians
of disability around the world.

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:18.615
Where is their platform?

00:02:18.639 --> 00:02:22.218
Where is the infrastructure
that creates a space for them

00:02:22.242 --> 00:02:26.019
so that they can collaborate
with other great musicians?

00:02:27.227 --> 00:02:29.625
So, ladies and gentlemen,
as you can probably tell,

00:02:29.649 --> 00:02:30.892
I'm on a bit of a mission.

00:02:30.916 --> 00:02:32.967
And this mission has
a personal root to it.

00:02:32.991 --> 00:02:36.460
I have four children, the youngest of whom
was born with cerebral palsy.

00:02:36.484 --> 00:02:39.883
She's now five, and through
her glorious existence,

00:02:39.907 --> 00:02:43.385
I suppose I have now become
a fully paid-up member

00:02:43.409 --> 00:02:48.374
of the amazing, dizzyingly wonderful
disabled community.

00:02:48.398 --> 00:02:50.515
And I find myself looking
at the Paralympics

00:02:50.539 --> 00:02:53.009
and thinking what
an incredible model that is.

00:02:53.568 --> 00:02:56.427
It's taken a good five decades, actually,

00:02:56.451 --> 00:02:58.066
but I can say with hand on heart

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:00.622
that when the Paralympics
comes to London next year,

00:03:00.646 --> 00:03:05.030
there will not be an intelligent
person anywhere on the planet

00:03:05.054 --> 00:03:11.042
who does not absolutely believe
in the validity of disabled sportspeople.

00:03:11.066 --> 00:03:13.397
What an amazing position to be in!

00:03:13.421 --> 00:03:16.803
So, ladies and gentlemen,
where the hell is music in all this?

00:03:17.297 --> 00:03:19.820
Apologies to any of you
who are sports fans,

00:03:19.844 --> 00:03:22.763
but music is far more
universal than sport.

00:03:23.336 --> 00:03:26.078
Where is the platform?
Where is their voice?

00:03:26.745 --> 00:03:31.777
So, we in the UK are at the very early
stages in forming what will be

00:03:31.801 --> 00:03:35.548
Britain's first-ever
national disabled orchestra.

00:03:35.572 --> 00:03:37.906
We are going to call it
the British Paraorchestra,

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:40.820
because with the world's eyes
on London next year

00:03:40.844 --> 00:03:42.831
and particularly on the Paralympics,

00:03:42.855 --> 00:03:44.532
we want to throw down the gauntlet

00:03:44.556 --> 00:03:47.957
to every single other country
that is represented there,

00:03:47.981 --> 00:03:50.882
to say to them, "Here's our paraorchestra.

00:03:50.906 --> 00:03:52.397
Where's yours?"

00:03:52.421 --> 00:03:56.054
Every country should have
a multiplicity of paraorchestras

00:03:56.078 --> 00:03:58.099
of all shapes and sizes,

00:03:58.123 --> 00:03:59.592
no question.

00:03:59.616 --> 00:04:02.100
Now, today is a very special day for me,

00:04:02.124 --> 00:04:05.717
because it is the first time
that the first four members

00:04:05.741 --> 00:04:08.526
of my little embryonic paraorchestra

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:10.199
are going to play in public;

00:04:10.711 --> 00:04:15.109
four extraordinary musicians
of which the number will grow and grow.

00:04:15.133 --> 00:04:19.681
I hope in the end the Paraorchestra
could even be as big as 50 musicians.

00:04:19.705 --> 00:04:22.740
We present to you today
a little sonic adventure,

00:04:22.764 --> 00:04:26.855
a little piece of improvisational
whimsy, if you like,

00:04:26.879 --> 00:04:29.549
a piece on which, of course,
the ink is still wet,

00:04:29.573 --> 00:04:30.900
the clay is still wet.

00:04:30.924 --> 00:04:33.286
After all, improvisation
is never a fixed thing.

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:35.487
We decided what we wanted
to share with you,

00:04:35.511 --> 00:04:37.245
at the heart of our improvisation,

00:04:37.269 --> 00:04:40.132
was a tune which is beloved
of British people.

00:04:40.156 --> 00:04:41.980
It's one of the only folk melodies

00:04:42.004 --> 00:04:44.341
that we still recognize in our culture.

00:04:44.865 --> 00:04:48.152
And here's an interesting thing:
folk music can tell you an awful lot

00:04:48.176 --> 00:04:51.751
about the cultural DNA of the country
from which it originates.

00:04:52.381 --> 00:04:55.689
You see, we in Britain
are quietly melancholic.

00:04:56.166 --> 00:04:58.446
You know, the rain ... it does rain.

00:04:58.470 --> 00:04:59.798
The food's not so good.

00:04:59.822 --> 00:05:00.801
(Laughter)

00:05:00.825 --> 00:05:02.917
Quietly melancholic.

00:05:02.941 --> 00:05:05.871
Not blackly so, just quietly so.

00:05:05.895 --> 00:05:09.452
And as Shakespeare put it so
brilliantly in "Twelfth Night,"

00:05:09.476 --> 00:05:12.508
he loves music that has "a dying fall."

00:05:13.167 --> 00:05:17.861
So this melody, "Greensleeves,"
is chock-full of "dying fall."

00:05:17.885 --> 00:05:19.047
You may know this tune.

00:05:19.071 --> 00:05:21.815
(Singing) Da, da, da da da da, dying fall.

00:05:21.839 --> 00:05:22.924
(Laughter)

00:05:22.948 --> 00:05:25.461
Da da da, da da da da, dying fall.

00:05:25.485 --> 00:05:28.921
Da dee, da da na na ... dying fall ...
na na nee, na ah ah ah ah.

00:05:28.945 --> 00:05:31.894
Brief burst of sunshine, ladies
and gentlemen, the chorus --

00:05:31.918 --> 00:05:34.301
(Singing) Ya da da da, dying fall ...

00:05:34.325 --> 00:05:35.360
(Laughter)

00:05:35.384 --> 00:05:37.699
(Singing) Da da dee,
da da da da, dying fall ...

00:05:37.723 --> 00:05:39.723
Ya da da da, dying fall ...

00:05:41.139 --> 00:05:42.303
OK?

00:05:42.327 --> 00:05:46.043
It's like we need some melodic Viagra
in our culture, ladies and gentlemen.

00:05:46.067 --> 00:05:48.352
(Laughter)

00:05:48.376 --> 00:05:53.478
(Applause)

00:05:54.375 --> 00:05:55.539
It goes without saying

00:05:55.563 --> 00:05:58.512
that we are very much
at the starting gates with this project.

00:05:58.536 --> 00:06:01.161
We need your help, we need
the global community

00:06:01.185 --> 00:06:03.361
to help us deliver this dream,

00:06:03.385 --> 00:06:06.913
so that this orchestra
can be full steam ahead

00:06:06.937 --> 00:06:08.909
by summer 2012.

00:06:08.933 --> 00:06:11.365
If you think there's any way 
that you can help us,

00:06:11.389 --> 00:06:13.770
please, please, get in touch.

00:06:13.794 --> 00:06:18.007
And so, ladies and gentlemen, it gives
me enormous pride, pleasure and joy

00:06:18.031 --> 00:06:20.252
to introduce to you,
with a short improvisation

00:06:20.276 --> 00:06:23.383
upon that most melancholic
tune, "Greensleeves,"

00:06:23.407 --> 00:06:26.790
the first four members
of the British Paraorchestra.

00:06:27.932 --> 00:06:34.517
(Applause) (Cheers)

00:06:39.006 --> 00:06:44.507
(Music)

00:12:52.209 --> 00:12:57.700
(Applause)

00:13:01.945 --> 00:13:08.092
(Cheers) (Applause)
