00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Cholera was reported in Haiti

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
for the first time in over 50 years

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
last October.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
There was no way to predict

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
how far it would spread through water supplies

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
and how bad the situation would get.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
And not knowing where help was needed

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
always ensured that help was in short supply

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
in the areas that needed it most.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
We've gotten good at predicting and preparing for storms

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
before they take innocent lives

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
and cause irreversible damage,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
but we still can't do that with water,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
and here's why.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
Right now, if you want to test water in the field,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
you need a trained technician,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
expensive equipment like this,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
and you have to wait about a day

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
for chemical reactions to take place and provide results.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
It's too slow

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
to get a picture of conditions on the ground

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
before they change,

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
too expensive to implement

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
in all the places that require testing.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
And it ignores the fact that, in the meanwhile,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
people still need to drink water.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
Most of the information that we collected on the cholera outbreak

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
didn't come from testing water;

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
it came from forms like this,

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
which documented all the people

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
we failed to help.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
Countless lives have been saved

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
by canaries in coalmines --

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
a simple and invaluable way

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
for miners to know whether they're safe.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
I've been inspired by that simplicity as I've been working on this problem

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
with some of the most hardworking and brilliant people I've ever known.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
We think there's a simpler solution to this problem --

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
one that can be used

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
by people who face conditions like this everyday.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
It's in its early stages,

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
but this is what it looks like right now.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
We call it the Water Canary.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
It's a fast, cheap device

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
that answers an important question:

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
Is this water contaminated?

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
It doesn't require any special training.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
And instead of waiting for chemical reactions to take place,

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
it uses light.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
That means there's no waiting

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
for chemical reactions to take place,

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
no need to use reagents that can run out

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
and no need to be an expert

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
to get actionable information.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
To test water, you simply insert a sample

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
and, within seconds,

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
it either displays a red light, indicating contaminated water,

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
or a green light, indicating the sample is safe.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
This will make it possible

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000
for anyone to collect life-saving information

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000
and to monitor water quality conditions as they unfold.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000
We're also, on top of that,

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000
integrating wireless networking

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
into an affordable device

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
with GPS and GSM.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
What that means is that each reading can be automatically transmitted to servers

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
to be mapped in real time.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
With enough users,

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
maps like this will make it possible

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000
to take preventive action,

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000
containing hazards before they turn into emergencies

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
that take years to recover from.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
And then, instead of taking days

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
to disseminate this information to the people who need it most,

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000
it can happen automatically.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
We've seen how distributed networks,

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
big data and information

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
can transform society.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000
I think it's time for us to apply them to water.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000
Our goal over the next year is to get Water Canary ready for the field

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000
and to open-source the hardware

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000
so that anyone can contribute to the development and the evaluation,

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
so we can tackle this problem together.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000
Thank you.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.000
(Applause)
