00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
One of the most common ways of dividing the world

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
is into those who believe

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
and those who don't --

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
into the religious and the atheists.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
And for the last decade or so,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
it's been quite clear

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
what being an atheist means.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
There have been some very vocal atheists

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
who've pointed out,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
not just that religion is wrong,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
but that it's ridiculous.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
These people, many of whom have lived in North Oxford,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
have argued --

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
they've argued that believing in God

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
is akin to believing in fairies

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
and essentially that the whole thing

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
is a childish game.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
Now I think it's too easy.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
I think it's too easy

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
to dismiss the whole of religion that way.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
And it's as easy as shooting fish in a barrel.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
And what I'd like to inaugurate today

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
is a new way of being an atheist --

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
if you like, a new version of atheism

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
we could call Atheism 2.0.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
Now what is Atheism 2.0?

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
Well it starts from a very basic premise:

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
of course, there's no God.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
Of course, there are no deities or supernatural spirits

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
or angels, etc.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
Now let's move on; that's not the end of the story,

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
that's the very, very beginning.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
I'm interested in the kind of constituency

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
that thinks something along these lines:

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
that thinks, "I can't believe in any of this stuff.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
I can't believe in the doctrines.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
I don't think these doctrines are right.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000
But," a very important but, "I love Christmas carols.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000
I really like the art of Mantegna.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
I really like looking at old churches.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
I really like turning the pages of the Old Testament."

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
Whatever it may be,

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
you know the kind of thing I'm talking about --

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
people who are attracted to the ritualistic side,

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
the moralistic, communal side of religion,

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
but can't bear the doctrine.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
Until now, these people have faced a rather unpleasant choice.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
It's almost as though either you accept the doctrine

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
and then you can have all the nice stuff,

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
or you reject the doctrine and

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
you're living in some kind of spiritual wasteland

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
under the guidance of CNN and Walmart.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
So that's a sort of tough choice.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
I don't think we have to make that choice.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
I think there is an alternative.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
I think there are ways --

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000
and I'm being both very respectful and completely impious --

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
of stealing from religions.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
If you don't believe in a religion,

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
there's nothing wrong with picking and mixing,

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000
with taking out the best sides of religion.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
And for me, atheism 2.0

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
is about both, as I say,

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
a respectful and an impious way

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000
of going through religions and saying, "What here could we use?"

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
The secular world is full of holes.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000
We have secularized badly, I would argue.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
And a thorough study of religion

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
could give us all sorts of insights

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000
into areas of life that are not going too well.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.000
And I'd like to run through a few of these today.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
I'd like to kick off by looking at education.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
Now education is a field

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
the secular world really believes in.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
When we think about how we're going to make the world a better place,

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
we think education; that's where we put a lot of money.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000
Education is going to give us, not only commercial skills, industrial skills,

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
it's also going to make us better people.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000
You know the kind of thing a commencement address is, and graduation ceremonies,

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000
those lyrical claims

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000
that education, the process of education -- particularly higher education --

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000
will make us into nobler and better human beings.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
That's a lovely idea.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000
Interesting where it came from.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000
In the early 19th century,

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
church attendance in Western Europe

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
started sliding down very, very sharply, and people panicked.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
They asked themselves the following question.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000
They said, where are people going to find the morality,

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000
where are they going to find guidance,

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000
and where are they going to find sources of consolation?

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000
And influential voices came up with one answer.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000
They said culture.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000
It's to culture that we should look

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000
for guidance, for consolation, for morality.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000
Let's look to the plays of Shakespeare,

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.000
the dialogues of Plato, the novels of Jane Austen.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000
In there, we'll find a lot of the truths

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.000
that we might previously have found in the Gospel of Saint John.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000
Now I think that's a very beautiful idea and a very true idea.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.000
They wanted to replace scripture with culture.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000
And that's a very plausible idea.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.000
It's also an idea that we have forgotten.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000
If you went to a top university --

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000
let's say you went to Harvard or Oxford or Cambridge --

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000
and you said, "I've come here

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000
because I'm in search of morality, guidance and consolation;

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000
I want to know how to live,"

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.000
they would show you the way to the insane asylum.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.000
This is simply not what our grandest and best institutes of higher learning

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
are in the business of.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
Why? They don't think we need it.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000
They don't think we are in an urgent need of assistance.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000
They see us as adults, rational adults.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000
What we need is information.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000
We need data, we don't need help.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.000
Now religions start from a very different place indeed.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000
All religions, all major religions,

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.000
at various points call us children.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000
And like children,

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000
they believe that we are in severe need of assistance.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000
We're only just holding it together.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000
Perhaps this is just me, maybe you.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.000
But anyway, we're only just holding it together.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000
And we need help. Of course, we need help.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000
And so we need guidance and we need didactic learning.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000
You know, in the 18th century in the U.K.,

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.000
the greatest preacher, greatest religious preacher, was a man called John Wesley,

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.000
who went up and down this country delivering sermons,

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000
advising people how they could live.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000
He delivered sermons on the duties of parents to their children

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000
and children to their parents,

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000
the duties of the rich to the poor and the poor to the rich.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000
He was trying to tell people how they should live

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000
through the medium of sermons,

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.000
the classic medium of delivery of religions.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000
Now we've given up with the idea of sermons.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000
If you said to a modern liberal individualist,

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000
"Hey, how about a sermon?"

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.000
they'd go, "No, no. I don't need one of those.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000
I'm an independent, individual person."

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.000
What's the difference between a sermon

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.000
and our modern, secular mode of delivery, the lecture?

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.000
Well a sermon wants to change your life

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.000
and a lecture wants to give you a bit of information.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.000
And I think we need to get back to that sermon tradition.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000
The tradition of sermonizing is hugely valuable,

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.000
because we are in need of guidance,

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000
morality and consolation --

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000
and religions know that.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000
Another point about education:

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000
we tend to believe in the modern secular world

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.000
that if you tell someone something once, they'll remember it.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000
Sit them in a classroom, tell them about Plato

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.000
at the age of 20, send them out for a career in management consultancy for 40 years,

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000
and that lesson will stick with them.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000
Religions go, "Nonsense.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.000
You need to keep repeating the lesson 10 times a day.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.000
So get on your knees and repeat it."

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.000
That's what all religions tell us:

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.000
"Get on you knees and repeat it 10 or 20 or 15 times a day."

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000
Otherwise our minds are like sieves.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000
So religions are cultures of repetition.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000
They circle the great truths again and again and again.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000
We associate repetition with boredom.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000
"Give us the new," we're always saying.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000
"The new is better than the old."

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.000
If I said to you, "Okay, we're not going to have new TED.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.000
We're just going to run through all the old ones

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000
and watch them five times because they're so true.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.000
We're going to watch Elizabeth Gilbert five times

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.000
because what she says is so clever," you'd feel cheated.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.000
Not so if you're adopting a religious mindset.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.000
The other things that religions do

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000
is to arrange time.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000
All the major religions give us calendars.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.000
What is a calendar?

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:01.000
A calendar is a way of making sure that across the year

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:04.000
you will bump into certain very important ideas.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:07.000
In the Catholic chronology, Catholic calendar,

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000
at the end of March you will think about St. Jerome

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000
and his qualities of humility and goodness

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.000
and his generosity to the poor.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:16.000
You won't do that by accident; you will do that because you are guided to do that.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.000
Now we don't think that way.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.000
In the secular world we think, "If an idea is important, I'll bump into it.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.000
I'll just come across it."

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.000
Nonsense, says the religious world view.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.000
Religious view says we need calendars, we need to structure time,

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000
we need to synchronize encounters.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000
This comes across also

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.000
in the way in which religions set up rituals

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.000
around important feelings.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.000
Take the Moon. It's really important to look at the Moon.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.000
You know, when you look at the Moon,

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.000
you think, "I'm really small. What are my problems?"

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.000
It sets things into perspective, etc., etc.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.000
We should all look at the Moon a bit more often. We don't.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:49.000
Why don't we? Well there's nothing to tell us, "Look at the Moon."

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:52.000
But if you're a Zen Buddhist in the middle of September,

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:55.000
you will be ordered out of your home, made to stand on a canonical platform

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.000
and made to celebrate the festival of Tsukimi,

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.000
where you will be given poems to read

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.000
in honor of the Moon and the passage of time

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.000
and the frailty of life that it should remind us of.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.000
You'll be handed rice cakes.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.000
And the Moon and the reflection on the Moon

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.000
will have a secure place in your heart.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.000
That's very good.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.000
The other thing that religions are really aware of

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.000
is: speak well --

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.000
I'm not doing a very good job of this here --

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:20.000
but oratory, oratory is absolutely key to religions.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:23.000
In the secular world, you can come through the university system and be a lousy speaker

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.000
and still have a great career.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.000
But the religious world doesn't think that way.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.000
What you're saying needs to be backed up

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000
by a really convincing way of saying it.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.000
So if you go to an African-American Pentecostalist church

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.000
in the American South

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.000
and you listen to how they talk,

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.000
my goodness, they talk well.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.000
After every convincing point, people will go, "Amen, amen, amen."

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.000
At the end of a really rousing paragraph, they'll all stand up,

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:47.000
and they'll go, "Thank you Jesus, thank you Christ, thank you Savior."

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.000
If we were doing it like they do it --

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:52.000
let's not do it, but if we were to do it --

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.000
I would tell you something like, "Culture should replace scripture."

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.000
And you would go, "Amen, amen, amen."

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.000
And at the end of my talk, you would all stand up

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.000
and you would go, "Thank you Plato, thank you Shakespeare, thank you Jane Austen."

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.000
And we'd know that we had a real rhythm going.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.000
All right, all right. We're getting there. We're getting there.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.000
(Applause)

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.000
The other thing that religions know is we're not just brains,

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.000
we are also bodies.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.000
And when they teach us a lesson,

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.000
they do it via the body.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.000
So for example,

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.000
take the Jewish idea of forgiveness.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.000
Jews are very interested in forgiveness

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.000
and how we should start anew and start afresh.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.000
They don't just deliver us sermons on this.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.000
They don't just give us books or words about this.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.000
They tell us to have a bath.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:32.000
So in Orthodox Jewish communities, every Friday you go to a Mikveh.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.000
You immerse yourself in the water,

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:37.000
and a physical action backs up a philosophical idea.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.000
We don't tend to do that.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:42.000
Our ideas are in one area and our behavior with our bodies is in another.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:44.000
Religions are fascinating in the way they try and combine the two.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.000
Let's look at art now.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:49.000
Now art is something that in the secular world,

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:52.000
we think very highly of. We think art is really, really important.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:55.000
A lot of our surplus wealth goes to museums, etc.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.000
We sometimes hear it said

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:00.000
that museums are our new cathedrals, or our new churches.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.000
You've heard that saying.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.000
Now I think that the potential is there,

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.000
but we've completely let ourselves down.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.000
And the reason we've let ourselves down

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.000
is that we're not properly studying

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:14.000
how religions handle art.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:17.000
The two really bad ideas that are hovering in the modern world

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:21.000
that inhibit our capacity to draw strength from art:

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.000
The first idea is that art should be for art's sake --

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.000
a ridiculous idea --

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.000
an idea that art should live in a hermetic bubble

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:30.000
and should not try to do anything with this troubled world.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.000
I couldn't disagree more.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:35.000
The other thing that we believe is that art shouldn't explain itself,

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.000
that artists shouldn't say what they're up to,

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.000
because if they said it, it might destroy the spell

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.000
and we might find it too easy.

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.000
That's why a very common feeling when you're in a museum --

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.000
let's admit it --

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.000
is, "I don't know what this is about."

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.000
But if we're serious people, we don't admit to that.

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:52.000
But that feeling of puzzlement is structural

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:55.000
to contemporary art.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.000
Now religions have a much saner attitude to art.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.000
They have no trouble telling us what art is about.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.000
Art is about two things in all the major faiths.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:03.000
Firstly, it's trying to remind you

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:05.000
of what there is to love.

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:07.000
And secondly, it's trying to remind you

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.000
of what there is to fear and to hate.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.000
And that's what art is.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:14.000
Art is a visceral encounter with the most important ideas of your faith.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.000
So as you walk around a church,

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.000
or a mosque or a cathedral,

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.000
what you're trying to imbibe, what you're imbibing is,

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.000
through your eyes, through your senses,

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.000
truths that have otherwise come to you through your mind.

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.000
Essentially it's propaganda.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.000
Rembrandt is a propagandist

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.000
in the Christian view.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.000
Now the word "propaganda" sets off alarm bells.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.000
We think of Hitler, we think of Stalin. Don't, necessarily.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:37.000
Propaganda is a manner of being didactic in honor of something.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:40.000
And if that thing is good, there's no problem with it at all.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:44.000
My view is that museums should take a leaf out of the book of religions.

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:46.000
And they should make sure that when you walk into a museum --

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.000
if I was a museum curator,

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:51.000
I would make a room for love, a room for generosity.

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.000
All works of art are talking to us about things.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.000
And if we were able to arrange spaces

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:57.000
where we could come across works

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.000
where we would be told, use these works of art

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.000
to cement these ideas in your mind,

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.000
we would get a lot more out of art.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:06.000
Art would pick up the duty that it used to have

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:09.000
and that we've neglected because of certain mis-founded ideas.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:11.000
Art should be one of the tools

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.000
by which we improve our society.

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:16.000
Art should be didactic.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.000
Let's think of something else.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.000
The people in the modern world, in the secular world,

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.000
who are interested in matters of the spirit,

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:24.000
in matters of the mind,

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:27.000
in higher soul-like concerns,

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:29.000
tend to be isolated individuals.

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:32.000
They're poets, they're philosophers, they're photographers, they're filmmakers.

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.000
And they tend to be on their own.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:37.000
They're our cottage industries. They are vulnerable, single people.

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.000
And they get depressed and they get sad on their own.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:41.000
And they don't really change much.

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.000
Now think about religions, think about organized religions.

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:45.000
What do organized religions do?

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:48.000
They group together, they form institutions.

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.000
And that has all sorts of advantages.

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:53.000
First of all, scale, might.

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:56.000
The Catholic Church pulled in 97 billion dollars last year

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.000
according to the Wall Street Journal.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.000
These are massive machines.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:03.000
They're collaborative, they're branded, they're multinational,

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:05.000
and they're highly disciplined.

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:07.000
These are all very good qualities.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:09.000
We recognize them in relation to corporations.

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:11.000
And corporations are very like religions in many ways,

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:13.000
except they're right down at the bottom of the pyramid of needs.

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:15.000
They're selling us shoes and cars.

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:17.000
Whereas the people who are selling us the higher stuff --

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:19.000
the therapists, the poets --

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:21.000
are on their own and they have no power,

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.000
they have no might.

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:26.000
So religions are the foremost example

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:29.000
of an institution that is fighting for the things of the mind.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:32.000
Now we may not agree with what religions are trying to teach us,

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.000
but we can admire the institutional way

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:36.000
in which they're doing it.

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:39.000
Books alone, books written by lone individuals,

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:41.000
are not going to change anything.

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:43.000
We need to group together.

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:46.000
If you want to change the world, you have to group together, you have to be collaborative.

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.000
And that's what religions do.

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.000
They are multinational, as I say,

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:53.000
they are branded, they have a clear identity,

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.000
so they don't get lost in a busy world.

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.000
That's something we can learn from.

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:59.000
I want to conclude.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:01.000
Really what I want to say

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:04.000
is for many of you who are operating in a range of different fields,

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:07.000
there is something to learn from the example of religion --

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:10.000
even if you don't believe any of it.

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:12.000
If you're involved in anything that's communal,

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:14.000
that involves lots of people getting together,

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.000
there are things for you in religion.

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:19.000
If you're involved, say, in a travel industry in any way,

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:21.000
look at pilgrimage.

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:23.000
Look very closely at pilgrimage.

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:25.000
We haven't begun to scratch the surface

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:27.000
of what travel could be

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:29.000
because we haven't looked at what religions do with travel.

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:31.000
If you're in the art world,

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:33.000
look at the example of what religions are doing with art.

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:36.000
And if you're an educator in any way,

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:39.000
again, look at how religions are spreading ideas.

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:41.000
You may not agree with the ideas,

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:44.000
but my goodness, they're highly effective mechanisms for doing so.

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.000
So really my concluding point

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.000
is you may not agree with religion,

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:50.000
but at the end of the day,

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:52.000
religions are so subtle, so complicated,

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:54.000
so intelligent in many ways

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:57.000
that they're not fit to be abandoned to the religious alone;

00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:59.000
they're for all of us.

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:01.000
Thank you very much.

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:18.000
(Applause)

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.000
Chris Anderson: Now this is actually a courageous talk,

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:22.000
because you're kind of setting up yourself in some ways

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:24.000
to be ridiculed in some quarters.

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:26.000
AB: You can get shot by both sides.

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:28.000
You can get shot by the hard-headed atheists,

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:31.000
and you can get shot by those who fully believe.

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:33.000
CA: Incoming missiles from North Oxford at any moment.

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:35.000
AB: Indeed.

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:38.000
CA: But you left out one aspect of religion

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:40.000
that a lot of people might say

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:42.000
your agenda could borrow from,

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:44.000
which is this sense --

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:46.000
that's actually probably the most important thing to anyone who's religious --

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:48.000
of spiritual experience,

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:50.000
of some kind of connection

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:52.000
with something that's bigger than you are.

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:55.000
Is there any room for that experience in Atheism 2.0?

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:58.000
AB: Absolutely. I, like many of you, meet people

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:01.000
who say things like, "But isn't there something bigger than us,

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:03.000
something else?"

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:06.000
And I say, "Of course." And they say, "So aren't you sort of religious?"

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:09.000
And I go, "No." Why does that sense of mystery,

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:12.000
that sense of the dizzying scale of the universe,

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:15.000
need to be accompanied by a mystical feeling?

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:17.000
Science and just observation

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:19.000
gives us that feeling without it,

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:21.000
so I don't feel the need.

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:23.000
The universe is large and we are tiny,

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:27.000
without the need for further religious superstructure.

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:29.000
So one can have so-called spiritual moments

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:31.000
without belief in the spirit.

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:33.000
CA: Actually, let me just ask a question.

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:35.000
How many people here would say

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:37.000
that religion is important to them?

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:42.000
Is there an equivalent process

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:44.000
by which there's a sort of bridge

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:47.000
between what you're talking about and what you would say to them?

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:49.000
AB: I would say that there are many, many gaps in secular life

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:51.000
and these can be plugged.

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:53.000
It's not as though, as I try to suggest,

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:55.000
it's not as though either you have religion

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:57.000
and then you have to accept all sorts of things,

00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:59.000
or you don't have religion

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:02.000
and then you're cut off from all these very good things.

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:05.000
It's so sad that we constantly say,

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:07.000
"I don't believe so I can't have community,

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:09.000
so I'm cut off from morality,

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:11.000
so I can't go on a pilgrimage."

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:13.000
One wants to say, "Nonsense. Why not?"

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:15.000
And that's really the spirit of my talk.

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:17.000
There's so much we can absorb.

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:20.000
Atheism shouldn't cut itself off from the rich sources of religion.

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:23.000
CA: It seems to me that there's plenty of people in the TED community

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:25.000
who are atheists.

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:27.000
But probably most people in the community

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:30.000
certainly don't think that religion is going away any time soon

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:32.000
and want to find the language

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:35.000
to have a constructive dialogue

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:37.000
and to feel like we can actually talk to each other

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:39.000
and at least share some things in common.

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:41.000
Are we foolish to be optimistic

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:43.000
about the possibility of a world

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:46.000
where, instead of religion being the great rallying cry

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:48.000
of divide and war,

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:50.000
that there could be bridging?

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:53.000
AB: No, we need to be polite about differences.

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:55.000
Politeness is a much-overlooked virtue.

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:57.000
It's seen as hypocrisy.

00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:59.000
But we need to get to a stage when you're an atheist

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:02.000
and someone says, "Well you know, I did pray the other day,"

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:04.000
you politely ignore it.

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:06.000
You move on.

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:09.000
Because you've agreed on 90 percent of things,

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:11.000
because you have a shared view on so many things,

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:13.000
and you politely differ.

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:17.000
And I think that's what the religious wars of late have ignored.

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:20.000
They've ignored the possibility of harmonious disagreement.

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:23.000
CA: And finally, does this new thing that you're proposing

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:25.000
that's not a religion but something else,

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:27.000
does it need a leader,

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:29.000
and are you volunteering to be the pope?

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:31.000
(Laughter)

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:33.000
AB: Well, one thing that we're all very suspicious of

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:35.000
is individual leaders.

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:37.000
It doesn't need it.

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:39.000
What I've tried to lay out is a framework

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:42.000
and I'm hoping that people can just fill it in.

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:44.000
I've sketched a sort of broad framework.

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:47.000
But wherever you are, as I say, if you're in the travel industry, do that travel bit.

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:50.000
If you're in the communal industry, look at religion and do the communal bit.

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:52.000
So it's a wiki project.

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:54.000
(Laughter)

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:57.000
CA: Alain, thank you for sparking many conversations later.

00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:00.000
(Applause)
