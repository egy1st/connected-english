00:00:05.364 --> 00:00:12.065
In the 1980s, in communist
Eastern Germany,

00:00:12.089 --> 00:00:15.263
if you owned a typewriter,

00:00:15.287 --> 00:00:18.088
you had to register it
with the government.

00:00:18.112 --> 00:00:23.576
You had to register a sample sheet of text
out of the typewriter.

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:27.151
And this was done
so the government could track

00:00:27.175 --> 00:00:28.920
where the text was coming from.

00:00:28.944 --> 00:00:34.639
If they found a paper
which had the wrong kind of thought,

00:00:34.663 --> 00:00:37.807
they could track down
who created that thought.

00:00:39.109 --> 00:00:40.703
And we in the West

00:00:41.894 --> 00:00:44.576
couldn't understand
how anybody would do this,

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:47.777
how much this would restrict
freedom of speech.

00:00:47.801 --> 00:00:51.077
We would never do that
in our own countries.

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:59.476
But today, in 2011, if you go
and buy a color laser printer

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:03.339
from any major laser printer manufacturer

00:01:03.363 --> 00:01:04.800
and print a page,

00:01:04.824 --> 00:01:06.576
that page will end up

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.820
having slight yellow dots
printed on every single page,

00:01:11.844 --> 00:01:17.287
in a pattern which makes the page unique
to you and to your printer.

00:01:19.121 --> 00:01:22.456
This is happening to us today.

00:01:24.098 --> 00:01:27.180
And nobody seems
to be making a fuss about it.

00:01:28.355 --> 00:01:31.019
And this is an example

00:01:31.043 --> 00:01:37.895
of the ways our own governments
are using technology

00:01:37.919 --> 00:01:39.973
against us, the citizens.

00:01:41.919 --> 00:01:46.253
And this is one of the main three sources
of online problems today.

00:01:46.277 --> 00:01:49.267
If we look at what's really
happening in the online world,

00:01:49.291 --> 00:01:52.196
we can group the attacks
based on the attackers.

00:01:52.768 --> 00:01:54.576
We have three main groups.

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.039
We have online criminals.

00:01:56.063 --> 00:01:58.266
Like here, we have Mr. Dmitry Golubov,

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.266
from the city of Kiev in Ukraine.

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:05.576
And the motives of online criminals
are very easy to understand.

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:07.194
These guys make money.

00:02:07.218 --> 00:02:11.472
They use online attacks
to make lots of money --

00:02:11.496 --> 00:02:13.473
and lots and lots of it.

00:02:13.497 --> 00:02:18.882
We actually have several cases
of millionaires online, multimillionaires,

00:02:18.906 --> 00:02:20.666
who made money with their attacks.

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:24.192
Here's Vladimir Tsastsin,
from Tartu in Estonia.

00:02:24.216 --> 00:02:26.011
This is [Albert] Gonzalez.

00:02:26.035 --> 00:02:27.810
This is Stephen Watt.

00:02:27.834 --> 00:02:29.632
This is Bjorn Sundin.

00:02:29.656 --> 00:02:31.597
This is Matthew Anderson, Tariq Al-Daour

00:02:31.621 --> 00:02:33.933
and so on and so on.

00:02:34.996 --> 00:02:39.215
These guys make their fortunes online,

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:41.576
but they make it through the illegal means

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:44.295
of using things like banking Trojans

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:47.772
to steal money from our bank accounts
while we do online banking,

00:02:47.796 --> 00:02:50.046
or with keyloggers

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:52.328
to collect our credit card information

00:02:52.352 --> 00:02:55.913
while we are doing online shopping
from an infected computer.

00:02:55.937 --> 00:02:58.291
The US Secret Service,

00:02:58.315 --> 00:03:01.337
two months ago,
froze the Swiss bank account

00:03:01.361 --> 00:03:03.942
of Mr. Sam Jain right here,

00:03:03.966 --> 00:03:07.678
and that bank account
had 14.9 million US dollars in it

00:03:07.702 --> 00:03:09.093
when it was frozen.

00:03:09.117 --> 00:03:12.354
Mr. Jain himself is on the loose;
nobody knows where he is.

00:03:13.377 --> 00:03:15.821
And I claim it's already today

00:03:17.075 --> 00:03:22.797
that it's more likely for any of us
to become the victim of a crime online

00:03:22.821 --> 00:03:25.191
than here in the real world.

00:03:26.431 --> 00:03:29.376
And it's very obvious
that this is only going to get worse.

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:33.776
In the future, the majority of crime
will be happening online.

00:03:36.228 --> 00:03:39.576
The second major group of attackers
that we are watching today

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:41.859
are not motivated by money.

00:03:41.883 --> 00:03:43.986
They're motivated by something else --

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:45.987
motivated by protests,

00:03:46.011 --> 00:03:48.223
motivated by an opinion,

00:03:48.247 --> 00:03:50.418
motivated by the laughs.

00:03:50.442 --> 00:03:55.967
Groups like Anonymous
have risen up over the last 12 months

00:03:55.991 --> 00:03:59.947
and have become a major player
in the field of online attacks.

00:04:01.027 --> 00:04:02.859
So those are the three main attackers:

00:04:02.883 --> 00:04:04.938
criminals who do it for the money,

00:04:04.962 --> 00:04:09.461
hacktivists like Anonymous
doing it for the protest,

00:04:09.485 --> 00:04:12.687
but then the last group
are nation states --

00:04:12.711 --> 00:04:14.750
governments doing the attacks.

00:04:17.291 --> 00:04:20.784
And then we look at cases
like what happened in DigiNotar.

00:04:20.808 --> 00:04:24.694
This is a prime example of what happens
when governments attack

00:04:24.718 --> 00:04:26.414
against their own citizens.

00:04:27.152 --> 00:04:32.139
DigiNotar is a certificate
authority from the Netherlands --

00:04:32.163 --> 00:04:33.739
or actually, it was.

00:04:33.763 --> 00:04:38.985
It was running into bankruptcy last fall,

00:04:39.009 --> 00:04:40.777
because they were hacked into.

00:04:40.801 --> 00:04:44.165
Somebody broke in
and they hacked it thoroughly.

00:04:45.331 --> 00:04:47.906
And I asked last week,

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:52.053
in a meeting with Dutch
government representatives,

00:04:52.077 --> 00:04:55.771
I asked one of the leaders of the team

00:04:56.890 --> 00:05:02.220
whether he found plausible
that people died

00:05:02.244 --> 00:05:04.028
because of the DigiNotar hack.

00:05:06.187 --> 00:05:08.627
And his answer was: yes.

00:05:10.813 --> 00:05:12.852
So how do people die

00:05:12.876 --> 00:05:14.582
as the result of a hack like this?

00:05:15.789 --> 00:05:17.576
Well, DigiNotar is a CA.

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:19.576
They sell certificates.

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:21.206
What do you do with certificates?

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:23.772
Well, you need a certificate
if you have a website

00:05:23.796 --> 00:05:27.399
that has https, SSL encrypted services,

00:05:28.465 --> 00:05:31.214
services like Gmail.

00:05:32.103 --> 00:05:35.764
Now we all, or a big part of us,
use Gmail or one of their competitors,

00:05:35.788 --> 00:05:41.576
but these services are especially popular
in totalitarian states like Iran,

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:46.576
where dissidents
use foreign services like Gmail

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:49.791
because they know they are more
trustworthy than the local services

00:05:49.815 --> 00:05:52.576
and they are encrypted
over SSL connections,

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:55.904
so the local government
can't snoop on their discussions.

00:05:56.936 --> 00:05:58.280
Except they can,

00:05:58.304 --> 00:06:02.155
if they hack into a foreign CA
and issue rogue certificates.

00:06:02.179 --> 00:06:06.040
And this is exactly what happened
with the case of DigiNotar.

00:06:09.849 --> 00:06:11.841
What about Arab Spring

00:06:11.865 --> 00:06:15.176
and things that have been happening,
for example, in Egypt?

00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:16.543
Well, in Egypt,

00:06:16.567 --> 00:06:20.274
the rioters looted the headquarters
of the Egyptian secret police

00:06:20.298 --> 00:06:22.888
in April 2011,

00:06:22.912 --> 00:06:26.056
and when they were looting the building,
they found lots of papers.

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:29.937
Among those papers
was this binder entitled, "FinFisher."

00:06:29.961 --> 00:06:34.797
And within that binder were notes
from a company based in Germany,

00:06:34.821 --> 00:06:38.343
which had sold to the Egyptian government

00:06:38.367 --> 00:06:43.070
a set of tools for intercepting,
at a very large scale,

00:06:43.094 --> 00:06:46.145
all the communication
of the citizens of the country.

00:06:46.169 --> 00:06:51.045
They had sold this tool for 280,000 euros
to the Egyptian government.

00:06:51.069 --> 00:06:53.989
The company headquarters are right here.

00:06:54.013 --> 00:06:58.430
So Western governments are providing
totalitarian governments with tools

00:06:58.454 --> 00:07:00.702
to do this against their own citizens.

00:07:02.033 --> 00:07:05.010
But Western governments
are doing it to themselves as well.

00:07:05.034 --> 00:07:07.205
For example, in Germany,

00:07:07.229 --> 00:07:11.792
just a couple of weeks ago,
the so-called "State Trojan" was found,

00:07:11.816 --> 00:07:15.568
which was a Trojan used
by German government officials

00:07:15.592 --> 00:07:17.795
to investigate their own citizens.

00:07:17.819 --> 00:07:21.523
If you are a suspect in a criminal case,

00:07:21.547 --> 00:07:24.072
well, it's pretty obvious,
your phone will be tapped.

00:07:24.096 --> 00:07:26.338
But today, it goes beyond that.

00:07:26.362 --> 00:07:28.281
They will tap your Internet connection.

00:07:28.305 --> 00:07:31.041
They will even use tools like State Trojan

00:07:31.065 --> 00:07:33.577
to infect your computer with a Trojan,

00:07:33.601 --> 00:07:37.967
which enables them
to watch all your communication,

00:07:37.991 --> 00:07:40.808
to listen to your online discussions,

00:07:40.832 --> 00:07:42.933
to collect your passwords.

00:07:46.556 --> 00:07:51.776
Now, when we think deeper
about things like these,

00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:57.114
the obvious response
from people should be,

00:07:57.138 --> 00:08:01.380
"OK, well, that sounds bad,
but that doesn't really affect me,

00:08:01.404 --> 00:08:03.580
because I'm a legal citizen.

00:08:03.604 --> 00:08:06.327
Why should I worry?
Because I have nothing to hide."

00:08:08.113 --> 00:08:10.560
And this is an argument
which doesn't make sense.

00:08:11.977 --> 00:08:14.786
Privacy is implied.

00:08:14.810 --> 00:08:18.475
Privacy is not up for discussion.

00:08:19.278 --> 00:08:21.150
This is not a question

00:08:21.174 --> 00:08:25.723
between privacy

00:08:25.747 --> 00:08:27.437
against security.

00:08:28.469 --> 00:08:32.024
It's a question of freedom

00:08:32.048 --> 00:08:33.489
against control.

00:08:34.786 --> 00:08:41.649
And while we might trust our governments
right now, right here in 2011,

00:08:41.673 --> 00:08:45.112
any rights we give away
will be given away for good.

00:08:45.136 --> 00:08:49.717
And do we trust, do we blindly trust,
any future government,

00:08:49.741 --> 00:08:53.025
a government we might have
50 years from now?

00:08:56.200 --> 00:08:58.986
And these are the questions

00:08:59.010 --> 00:09:02.223
that we have to worry about
for the next 50 years.
