WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
I'm going to start here.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
This is a hand-lettered sign

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
that appeared in a mom and pop bakery

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
in my old neighborhood in Brooklyn a few years ago.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
The store owned one of those machines

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
that can print on plates of sugar.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
And kids could bring in drawings

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
and have the store print a sugar plate

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
for the top of their birthday cake.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
But unfortunately, one of the things kids liked to draw

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
was cartoon characters.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
They liked to draw the Little Mermaid,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
they'd like to draw a smurf, they'd like to draw Micky Mouse.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
But it turns out to be illegal

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
to print a child's drawing of Micky Mouse

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
onto a plate of sugar.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
And it's a copyright violation.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
And policing copyright violations

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
for children's birthday cakes

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
was such a hassle

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
that the College Bakery said,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
"You know what, we're getting out of that business.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
If you're an amateur,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
you don't have access to our machine anymore.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
If you want a printed sugar birthday cake,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
you have to use one of our prefab images --

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
only for professionals."

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
So there's two bills in Congress right now.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
One is called SOPA, the other is called PIPA.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
SOPA stands for the Stop Online Piracy Act.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
It's from the Senate.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
PIPA is short for PROTECTIP,

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
which is itself short for

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
Preventing Real Online Threats

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
to Economic Creativity

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
and Theft of Intellectual Property --

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
because the congressional aides who name these things

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
have a lot of time on their hands.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
And what SOPA and PIPA want to do

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
is they want to do this.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
They want to raise the cost

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000
of copyright compliance

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
to the point where people simply get out of the business

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
of offering it as a capability to amateurs.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
Now the way they propose to do this

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
is to identify sites

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
that are substantially infringing on copyright --

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
although how those sites are identified

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
is never fully specified in the bills --

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
and then they want to remove them from the domain name system.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
They want to take them out of the domain name system.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
Now the domain name system

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
is the thing that turns human-readable names, like Google.com,

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
into the kinds of addresses

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
machines expect --

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.000
74.125.226.212.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000
Now the problem with this model of censorship,

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
of identifying a site

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
and then trying to remove it from the domain name system,

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
is that it won't work.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000
And you'd think that would be a pretty big problem for a law,

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
but Congress seems not to have let that bother them too much.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
Now the reason it won't work

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.000
is that you can still type 74.125.226.212 into the browser

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
or you can make it a clickable link

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
and you'll still go to Google.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
So the policing layer

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000
around the problem

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.000
becomes the real threat of the act.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000
Now to understand how Congress came to write a bill

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000
that won't accomplish its stated goals,

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000
but will produce a lot of pernicious side effects,

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
you have to understand a little bit about the back story.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
And the back story is this:

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
SOPA and PIPA, as legislation,

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000
were drafted largely by media companies

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000
that were founded in the 20th century.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000
The 20th century was a great time to be a media company,

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000
because the thing you really had on your side was scarcity.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
If you were making a TV show,

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.000
it didn't have to be better than all other TV shows ever made;

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
it only had to be better

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000
than the two other shows

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000
that were on at the same time --

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000
which is a very low threshold

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.000
of competitive difficulty.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
Which meant

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000
that if you fielded average content,

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.000
you got a third of the U.S. public for free --

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000
tens of millions of users

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000
for simply doing something

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000
that wasn't too terrible.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000
This is like having a license to print money

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000
and a barrel of free ink.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.000
But technology moved on, as technology is wont to do.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.000
And slowly, slowly, at the end of the 20th century,

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000
that scarcity started to get eroded --

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000
and I don't mean by digital technology;

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000
I mean by analog technology.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000
Cassette tapes, video cassette recorders,

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
even the humble Xerox machine

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
created new opportunities

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000
for us to behave in ways

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000
that astonished the media business.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000
Because it turned out

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000
we're not really couch potatoes.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000
We don't really like to only consume.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000
We do like to consume,

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.000
but every time one of these new tools came along,

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000
it turned out we also like to produce

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000
and we like to share.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000
And this freaked the media businesses out --

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.000
it freaked them out every time.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000
Jack Valenti, who was the head lobbyist

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000
for the Motion Picture Association of America,

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:33.000
once likened the ferocious video cassette recorder

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000
to Jack the Ripper

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000
and poor, helpless Hollywood

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.000
to a woman at home alone.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000
That was the level of rhetoric.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000
And so the media industries

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000
begged, insisted, demanded

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000
that Congress do something.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000
And Congress did something.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
By the early 90s, Congress passed the law

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.000
that changed everything.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000
And that law was called the Audio Home Recording Act

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000
of 1992.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.000
What the Audio Home Recording Act of 1992 said was,

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000
look, if people are taping stuff off the radio

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.000
and then making mixtapes for their friends,

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.000
that is not a crime. That's okay.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000
Taping and remixing

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.000
and sharing with your friends is okay.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000
If you make lots and lots of high quality copies and you sell them,

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000
that's not okay.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000
But this taping business,

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000
fine, let it go.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.000
And they thought that they clarified the issue,

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000
because they'd set out a clear distinction

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000
between legal and illegal copying.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000
But that wasn't what the media businesses wanted.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.000
They had wanted Congress

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.000
to outlaw copying full-stop.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.000
So when the Audio Home Recording Act of 1992 was passed,

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:45.000
the media businesses gave up on the idea

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000
of legal versus illegal distinctions for copying

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.000
because it was clear

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000
that if Congress was acting in their framework,

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:55.000
they might actually increase the rights of citizens

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000
to participate in our own media environment.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.000
So they went for plan B.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000
It took them a while to formulate plan B.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.000
Plan B appeared in its first full-blown form

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000
in 1998 --

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.000
something called the Digital Millennium Copyright Act.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000
It was a complicated piece of legislation, a lot of moving parts.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.000
But the main thrust of the DMCA

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000
was that it was legal to sell you

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000
uncopyable digital material --

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.000
except that there's no such things as uncopyable digital material.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000
It would be, as Ed Felton once famously said,

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000
"Like handing out water

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000
that wasn't wet."

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.000
Bits are copyable. That's what computers do.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.000
That is a side effect of their ordinary operation.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000
So in order to fake the ability

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000
to sell uncopyable bits,

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.000
the DMCA also made it legal

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.000
to force you to use systems

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.000
that broke the copying function of your devices.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.000
Every DVD player and game player

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:49.000
and television and computer you brought home --

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:52.000
no matter what you thought you were getting when you bought it --

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:55.000
could be broken by the content industries,

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.000
if they wanted to set that as a condition of selling you the content.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:01.000
And to make sure you didn't realize,

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:04.000
or didn't enact their capabilities

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.000
as general purpose computing devices,

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.000
they also made it illegal

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.000
for you to try to reset

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.000
the copyability of that content.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.000
The DMCA marks the moment

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.000
when the media industries

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.000
gave up on the legal system

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.000
of distinguishing between legal and illegal copying

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.000
and simply tried to prevent copying

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.000
through technical means.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.000
Now the DMCA had, and is continuing to have, a lot of complicated effects,

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:32.000
but in this one domain, limiting sharing,

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.000
it has mostly not worked.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000
And the main reason it hasn't worked

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.000
is the Internet has turned out to be far more popular and far more powerful

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.000
than anyone imagined.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.000
The mixtape, the fanzine,

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.000
that was nothing compared to what we're seeing now

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.000
with the Internet.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.000
We are in a world

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000
where most American citizens

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000
over the age of 12

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.000
share things with each other online.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.000
We share written things, we share images,

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000
we share audio, we share video.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000
Some of the stuff we share is stuff we've made.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000
Some of the stuff we share is stuff we've found.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.000
Some of the stuff we share

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.000
is stuff we've made out of what we've found,

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:11.000
and all of it horrifies those industries.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.000
So PIPA and SOPA

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.000
are round two.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.000
But where the DMCA was surgical --

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:20.000
we want to go down into your computer,

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:23.000
we want to go down into your television set, down into your game machine,

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.000
and prevent it from doing

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.000
what they said it would do at the store --

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.000
PIPA and SOPA are nuclear

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:33.000
and they're saying, we want to go anywhere in the world

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.000
and censor content.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:38.000
Now the mechanism, as I said, for doing this,

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:41.000
is you need to take out anybody

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.000
pointing to those IP addresses.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.000
You need to take them out of search engines,

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.000
you need to take them out of online directories,

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:50.000
you need to take them out of user lists.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:54.000
And because the biggest producers of content on the Internet

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:57.000
are not Google and Yahoo,

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.000
they're us,

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.000
we're the people getting policed.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.000
Because in the end,

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:06.000
the real threat

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:09.000
to the enactment of PIPA and SOPA

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.000
is our ability to share things with one another.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.000
So what PIPA and SOPA risk doing

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:18.000
is taking a centuries-old legal concept,

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.000
innocent until proven guilty,

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.000
and reversing it --

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.000
guilty until proven innocent.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.000
You can't share

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:29.000
until you show us

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.000
that you're not sharing something

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.000
we don't like.

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:36.000
Suddenly, the burden of proof for legal versus illegal

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.000
falls affirmatively on us

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.000
and on the services

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:43.000
that might be offering us any new capabilities.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:46.000
And if it costs even a dime

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.000
to police a user,

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.000
that will crush a service

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.000
with a hundred million users.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.000
So this is the Internet they have in mind.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:57.000
Imagine this sign everywhere --

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:00.000
except imagine it doesn't say College Bakery,

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.000
imagine it says YouTube

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.000
and Facebook and Twitter.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.000
Imagine it says TED,

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:09.000
because the comments can't be policed

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:12.000
at any acceptable cost.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:15.000
The real effects of SOPA and PIPA

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:18.000
are going to be different than the proposed effects.

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.000
The threat, in fact,

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:23.000
is this inversion of the burden of proof,

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.000
where we suddenly

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.000
are all treated like thieves

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:30.000
at every moment we're given the freedom to create,

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:33.000
to produce or to share.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:36.000
And the people who provide those capabilities to us --

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:39.000
the YouTubes, the Facebooks, the Twitters and TEDs --

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.000
are in the business

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.000
of having to police us,

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:46.000
or being on the hook for contributory infringement.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.000
There's two things you can do

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.000
to help stop this --

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:53.000
a simple thing and a complicated thing,

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.000
an easy thing and a hard thing.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.000
The simple thing, the easy thing, is this:

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.000
if you're an American citizen,

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:02.000
call your representative, call your senator.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:05.000
When you look at

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:08.000
the people who co-signed on the SOPA bill,

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.000
people who've co-signed on PIPA,

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:13.000
what you see is that they have cumulatively received

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:16.000
millions and millions of dollars

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.000
from the traditional media industries.

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.000
You don't have millions and millions of dollars,

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.000
but you can call your representatives,

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:25.000
and you can remind them that you vote,

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:28.000
and you can ask not to be treated like a thief,

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.000
and you can suggest that you would prefer

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:33.000
that the Internet not be broken.

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.000
And if you're not an American citizen,

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:37.000
you can contact American citizens that you know

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.000
and encourage them to do the same.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.000
Because this seems like a national issue,

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:43.000
but it is not.

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.000
These industries will not be content

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:47.000
with breaking our Internet.

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:50.000
If they break it, they will break it for everybody.

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.000
That's the easy thing.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.000
That's the simple thing.

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.000
The hard thing is this:

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:59.000
get ready, because more is coming.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:02.000
SOPA is simply a reversion of COICA,

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.000
which was purposed last year, which did not pass.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.000
And all of this goes back

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.000
to the failure of the DMCA

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.000
to disallow sharing as a technical means.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:13.000
And the DMCA goes back to the Audio Home Recording Act,

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:15.000
which horrified those industries.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:17.000
Because the whole business

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:20.000
of actually suggesting that someone is breaking the law

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.000
and then gathering evidence and proving that,

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:25.000
that turns out to be really inconvenient.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.000
"We'd prefer not to do that,"

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:29.000
says the content industries.

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:32.000
And what they want is not to have to do that.

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.000
They don't want legal distinctions

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.000
between legal and illegal sharing.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.000
They just want the sharing to go away.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:41.000
PIPA and SOPA are not oddities, they're not anomalies,

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.000
they're not events.

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:46.000
They're the next turn of this particular screw,

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.000
which has been going on 20 years now.

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.000
And if we defeat these, as I hope we do,

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:52.000
more is coming.

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:57.000
Because until we convince Congress

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:00.000
that the way to deal with copyright violation

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:04.000
is the way copyright violation was dealt with with Napster, with YouTube,

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:07.000
which is to have a trial with all the presentation of evidence

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:10.000
and the hashing out of facts and the assessment of remedies

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.000
that goes on in democratic societies.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.000
That's the way to handle this.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.000
In the meantime,

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.000
the hard thing to do is to be ready.

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:20.000
Because that's the real message of PIPA and SOPA.

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.000
Time Warner has called

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.000
and they want us all back on the couch,

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.000
just consuming --

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:28.000
not producing, not sharing --

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.000
and we should say, "No."

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.000
Thank you.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:38.000
(Applause)
