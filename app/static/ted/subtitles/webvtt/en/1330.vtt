00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Do you know how many choices you make

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
in a typical day?

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Do you know how many choices you make

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
in typical week?

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
I recently did a survey

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
with over 2,000 Americans,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
and the average number of choices

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
that the typical American reports making

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
is about 70 in a typical day.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
There was also recently a study done with CEOs

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
in which they followed CEOs around for a whole week.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
And these scientists simply documented all the various tasks

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
that these CEOs engaged in

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
and how much time they spent engaging

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
in making decisions related to these tasks.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
And they found that the average CEO

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
engaged in about 139 tasks in a week.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
Each task was made up of many, many, many sub-choices of course.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
50 percent of their decisions

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
were made in nine minutes or less.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Only about 12 percent of the decisions

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000
did they make an hour or more of their time.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
Think about your own choices.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
Do you know how many choices

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
make it into your nine minute category

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
versus your one hour category?

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
How well do you think you're doing

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
at managing those choices?

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
Today I want to talk

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
about one of the biggest modern day choosing problems that we have,

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
which is the choice overload problem.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
I want to talk about the problem

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
and some potential solutions.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
Now as I talk about this problem,

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
I'm going to have some questions for you

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
and I'm going to want to know your answers.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
So when I ask you a question,

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
since I'm blind,

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
only raise your hand if you want to burn off some calories.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
(Laughter)

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
Otherwise, when I ask you a question,

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
and if your answer is yes,

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
I'd like you to clap your hands.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
So for my first question for you today:

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
Are you guys ready to hear about the choice overload problem?

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
(Applause)

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
Thank you.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
So when I was a graduate student at Stanford University,

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
I used to go to this very, very upscale grocery store;

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
at least at that time it was truly upscale.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
It was a store called Draeger's.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
Now this store, it was almost like going to an amusement park.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
They had 250 different kinds of mustards and vinegars

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
and over 500 different kinds

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
of fruits and vegetables

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000
and more than two dozen different kinds of bottled water --

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.000
and this was during a time when we actually used to drink tap water.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
I used to love going to this store,

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
but on one occasion I asked myself,

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
well how come you never buy anything?

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
Here's their olive oil aisle.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
They had over 75 different kinds of olive oil,

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
including those that were in a locked case

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.000
that came from thousand-year-old olive trees.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
So I one day decided to pay a visit to the manager,

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
and I asked the manager,

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000
"Is this model of offering people all this choice really working?"

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
And he pointed to the busloads of tourists

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
that would show up everyday,

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
with cameras ready usually.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000
We decided to do a little experiment,

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
and we picked jam for our experiment.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
Here's their jam aisle.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
They had 348 different kinds of jam.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
We set up a little tasting booth

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
right near the entrance of the store.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
We there put out six different flavors of jam

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000
or 24 different flavors of jam,

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000
and we looked at two things:

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
First, in which case

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000
were people more likely to stop, sample some jam?

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000
More people stopped when there were 24, about 60 percent,

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000
than when there were six,

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000
about 40 percent.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
The next thing we looked at

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000
is in which case were people more likely

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
to buy a jar of jam.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000
Now we see the opposite effect.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000
Of the people who stopped when there were 24,

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000
only three percent of them actually bought a jar of jam.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.000
Of the people who stopped when there were six,

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000
well now we saw that 30 percent of them

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000
actually bought a jar of jam.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000
Now if you do the math,

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.000
people were at least six times more likely to buy a jar of jam

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000
if they encountered six

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000
than if they encountered 24.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000
Now choosing not to buy a jar of jam

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000
is probably good for us --

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000
at least it's good for our waistlines --

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000
but it turns out that this choice overload problem affects us

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000
even in very consequential decisions.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000
We choose not to choose,

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.000
even when it goes against our best self-interests.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.000
So now for the topic of today: financial savings.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:18.000
Now I'm going to describe to you a study I did

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.000
with Gur Huberman, Emir Kamenica, Wei Jang

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:25.000
where we looked at the retirement savings decisions

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.000
of nearly a million Americans

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000
from about 650 plans

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000
all in the U.S.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000
And what we looked at

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000
was whether the number of fund offerings

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000
available in a retirement savings plan,

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000
the 401(k) plan,

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000
does that affect people's likelihood

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000
to save more for tomorrow.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000
And what we found

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.000
was that indeed there was a correlation.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.000
So in these plans, we had about 657 plans

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000
that ranged from offering people

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.000
anywhere from two to 59 different fund offerings.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000
And what we found was that,

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000
the more funds offered,

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.000
indeed, there was less participation rate.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000
So if you look at the extremes,

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000
those plans that offered you two funds,

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.000
participation rates were around in the mid-70s --

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000
still not as high as we want it to be.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.000
In those plans that offered nearly 60 funds,

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.000
participation rates have now dropped

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.000
to about the 60th percentile.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000
Now it turns out

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.000
that even if you do choose to participate

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000
when there are more choices present,

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000
even then, it has negative consequences.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.000
So for those people who did choose to participate,

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.000
the more choices available,

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000
the more likely people were

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.000
to completely avoid stocks or equity funds.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000
The more choices available,

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000
the more likely they were

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.000
to put all their money in pure money market accounts.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000
Now neither of these extreme decisions

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000
are the kinds of decisions

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.000
that any of us would recommend for people

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.000
when you're considering their future financial well-being.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000
Well, over the past decade,

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000
we have observed three main negative consequences

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.000
to offering people more and more choices.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000
They're more likely to delay choosing --

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.000
procrastinate even when it goes against their best self-interest.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.000
They're more likely to make worse choices --

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.000
worse financial choices, medical choices.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.000
They're more likely to choose things that make them less satisfied,

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.000
even when they do objectively better.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000
The main reason for this

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:28.000
is because, we might enjoy gazing at those giant walls

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000
of mayonnaises, mustards, vinegars, jams,

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.000
but we can't actually do the math of comparing and contrasting

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:37.000
and actually picking from that stunning display.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000
So what I want to propose to you today

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.000
are four simple techniques --

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.000
techniques that we have tested in one way or another

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000
in different research venues --

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000
that you can easily apply

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000
in your businesses.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000
The first: Cut.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000
You've heard it said before,

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.000
but it's never been more true than today,

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.000
that less is more.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.000
People are always upset when I say, "Cut."

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000
They're always worried they're going to lose shelf space.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:07.000
But in fact, what we're seeing more and more

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000
is that if you are willing to cut,

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000
get rid of those extraneous redundant options,

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.000
well there's an increase in sales,

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000
there's a lowering of costs,

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:19.000
there is an improvement of the choosing experience.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.000
When Proctor &amp; Gamble

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.000
went from 26 different kinds of Head &amp; Shoulders to 15,

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:26.000
they saw an increase in sales by 10 percent.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.000
When the Golden Cat Corporation

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000
got rid of their 10 worst-selling cat litter products,

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000
they saw an increase in profits

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.000
by 87 percent --

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000
a function of both increase in sales

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.000
and lowering of costs.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.000
You know, the average grocery store today

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.000
offers you 45,000 products.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:45.000
The typical Walmart today offers you 100,000 products.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:50.000
But the ninth largest retailer,

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000
the ninth biggest retailer in the world today

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000
is Aldi,

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.000
and it offers you only 1,400 products --

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:00.000
one kind of canned tomato sauce.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000
Now in the financial savings world,

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:05.000
I think one of the best examples that has recently come out

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:08.000
on how to best manage the choice offerings

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:11.000
has actually been something that David Laibson was heavily involved in designing,

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.000
which was the program that they have at Harvard.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.000
Every single Harvard employee

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.000
is now automatically enrolled

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.000
in a lifecycle fund.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.000
For those people who actually want to choose,

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.000
they're given 20 funds,

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.000
not 300 or more funds.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.000
You know, often, people say,

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.000
"I don't know how to cut.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000
They're all important choices."

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:34.000
And the first thing I do is I ask the employees,

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.000
"Tell me how these choices are different from one another.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.000
And if your employees can't tell them apart,

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:41.000
neither can your consumers."

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:44.000
Now before we started our session this afternoon,

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000
I had a chat with Gary.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:49.000
And Gary said that he would be willing

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000
to offer people in this audience

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:54.000
an all-expenses-paid free vacation

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:58.000
to the most beautiful road in the world.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:01.000
Here's a description of the road.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.000
And I'd like you to read it.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.000
And now I'll give you a few seconds to read it

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.000
and then I want you to clap your hands

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.000
if you're ready to take Gary up on his offer.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.000
(Light clapping)

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:14.000
Okay. Anybody who's ready to take him up on his offer.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.000
Is that all?

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:19.000
All right, let me show you some more about this.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:22.000
(Laughter)

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:25.000
You guys knew there was a trick, didn't you.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.000
(Honk)

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:34.000
Now who's ready to go on this trip.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.000
(Applause)

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.000
(Laughter)

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:41.000
I think I might have actually heard more hands.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.000
All right.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.000
Now in fact,

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.000
you had objectively more information

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.000
the first time around than the second time around,

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.000
but I would venture to guess

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:55.000
that you felt that it was more real the second time around.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.000
Because the pictures made it feel

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.000
more real to you.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.000
Which brings me to the second technique

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.000
for handling the choice overload problem,

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.000
which is concretization.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.000
That in order for people to understand

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.000
the differences between the choices,

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.000
they have to be able to understand

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:14.000
the consequences associated with each choice,

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:17.000
and that the consequences need to be felt

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:21.000
in a vivid sort of way, in a very concrete way.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:24.000
Why do people spend an average of 15 to 30 percent more

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.000
when they use an ATM card or a credit card

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.000
as opposed to cash?

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.000
Because it doesn't feel like real money.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.000
And it turns out

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.000
that making it feel more concrete

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.000
can actually be a very positive tool

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.000
to use in getting people to save more.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.000
So a study that I did with Shlomo Benartzi

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.000
and Alessandro Previtero,

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:46.000
we did a study with people at ING --

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:49.000
employees that are all working at ING --

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.000
and now these people were all in a session

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:54.000
where they're doing enrollment for their 401(k) plan.

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.000
And during that session,

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.000
we kept the session exactly the way it used to be,

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:01.000
but we added one little thing.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:04.000
The one little thing we added

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:06.000
was we asked people

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:09.000
to just think about all the positive things that would happen in your life

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.000
if you saved more.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:14.000
By doing that simple thing,

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:17.000
there was an increase in enrollment by 20 percent

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:20.000
and there was an increase in the amount of people willing to save

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:23.000
or the amount that they were willing to put down into their savings account

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.000
by four percent.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:28.000
The third technique: Categorization.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:31.000
We can handle more categories

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:33.000
than we can handle choices.

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.000
So for example,

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:37.000
here's a study we did in a magazine aisle.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.000
It turns out that in Wegmans grocery stores

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.000
up and down the northeast corridor,

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:43.000
the magazine aisles range anywhere

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.000
from 331 different kinds of magazines

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:48.000
all the way up to 664.

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.000
But you know what?

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.000
If I show you 600 magazines

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:55.000
and I divide them up into 10 categories,

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:57.000
versus I show you 400 magazines

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:00.000
and divide them up into 20 categories,

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.000
you believe that I have given you

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.000
more choice and a better choosing experience

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.000
if I gave you the 400

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.000
than if I gave you the 600.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:11.000
Because the categories tell me how to tell them apart.

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:16.000
Here are two different jewelry displays.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:19.000
One is called "Jazz" and the other one is called "Swing."

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:22.000
If you think the display on the left is Swing

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:25.000
and the display on the right is Jazz,

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.000
clap your hands.

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:29.000
(Light Clapping)

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:31.000
Okay, there's some.

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:33.000
If you think the one on the left is Jazz and the one on the right is Swing,

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:35.000
clap your hands.

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:37.000
Okay, a bit more.

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.000
Now it turns out you're right.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:41.000
The one on the left is Jazz and the one on the right is Swing,

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.000
but you know what?

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:46.000
This is a highly useless categorization scheme.

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.000
(Laughter)

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:51.000
The categories need to say something

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:54.000
to the chooser, not the choice-maker.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.000
And you often see that problem

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:59.000
when it comes down to those long lists of all these funds.

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:03.000
Who are they actually supposed to be informing?

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:06.000
My fourth technique: Condition for complexity.

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.000
It turns out we can actually

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:10.000
handle a lot more information than we think we can,

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.000
we've just got to take it a little easier.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:15.000
We have to gradually increase the complexity.

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:18.000
I'm going to show you one example of what I'm talking about.

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:20.000
Let's take a very, very complicated decision:

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.000
buying a car.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.000
Here's a German car manufacturer

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:27.000
that gives you the opportunity to completely custom make your car.

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:29.000
You've got to make 60 different decisions,

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:31.000
completely make up your car.

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.000
Now these decisions vary

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:36.000
in the number of choices that they offer per decision.

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.000
Car colors, exterior car colors --

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.000
I've got 56 choices.

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:43.000
Engines, gearshift -- four choices.

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:45.000
So now what I'm going to do

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:48.000
is I'm going to vary the order in which these decisions appear.

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.000
So half of the customers

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.000
are going to go from high choice, 56 car colors,

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:55.000
to low choice, four gearshifts.

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.000
The other half of the customers

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:59.000
are going to go from low choice, four gearshifts,

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:02.000
to 56 car colors, high choice.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.000
What am I going to look at?

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:06.000
How engaged you are.

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:09.000
If you keep hitting the default button per decision,

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:11.000
that means you're getting overwhelmed,

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:13.000
that means I'm losing you.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:15.000
What you find

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:17.000
is the people who go from high choice to low choice,

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:20.000
they're hitting that default button over and over and over again.

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:22.000
We're losing them.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:24.000
They go from low choice to high choice,

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.000
they're hanging in there.

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:29.000
It's the same information. It's the same number of choices.

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:31.000
The only thing that I have done

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:33.000
is I have varied the order

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:35.000
in which that information is presented.

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:37.000
If I start you off easy,

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.000
I learn how to choose.

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:42.000
Even though choosing gearshift

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:45.000
doesn't tell me anything about my preferences for interior decor,

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:48.000
it still prepares me for how to choose.

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:51.000
It also gets me excited about this big product that I'm putting together,

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:53.000
so I'm more willing to be motivated

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:55.000
to be engaged.

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:57.000
So let me recap.

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:00.000
I have talked about four techniques

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:03.000
for mitigating the problem of choice overload --

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:06.000
cut -- get rid of the extraneous alternatives;

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:09.000
concretize -- make it real;

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:13.000
categorize -- we can handle more categories, less choices;

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:16.000
condition for complexity.

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:19.000
All of these techniques that I'm describing to you today

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:22.000
are designed to help you manage your choices --

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:25.000
better for you, you can use them on yourself,

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:27.000
better for the people that you are serving.

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:29.000
Because I believe that the key

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:31.000
to getting the most from choice

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:34.000
is to be choosy about choosing.

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:36.000
And the more we're able to be choosy about choosing

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:38.000
the better we will be able

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:40.000
to practice the art of choosing.

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:42.000
Thank you very much.

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:44.000
(Applause)
