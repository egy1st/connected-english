00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.801
So what makes a piece of music beautiful?

00:00:03.398 --> 00:00:05.719
Well, most musicologists would argue

00:00:05.743 --> 00:00:08.312
that repetition is a key aspect of beauty,

00:00:08.336 --> 00:00:11.345
the idea that we take a melody,
a motif, a musical idea,

00:00:11.369 --> 00:00:14.632
we repeat it, we set up
the expectation for repetition,

00:00:14.656 --> 00:00:17.503
and then we either realize it
or we break the repetition.

00:00:17.527 --> 00:00:19.614
And that's a key component of beauty.

00:00:19.638 --> 00:00:23.142
So if repetition and patterns
are key to beauty,

00:00:23.166 --> 00:00:25.578
then what would the absence
of patterns sound like,

00:00:25.602 --> 00:00:29.999
if we wrote a piece of music
that had no repetition whatsoever in it?

00:00:30.948 --> 00:00:33.448
That's actually an interesting
mathematical question.

00:00:33.472 --> 00:00:37.045
Is it possible to write a piece of music
that has no repetition whatsoever?

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:38.783
It's not random -- random is easy.

00:00:38.807 --> 00:00:41.454
Repetition-free, it turns
out, is extremely difficult,

00:00:41.478 --> 00:00:43.670
and the only reason
that we can actually do it

00:00:43.694 --> 00:00:47.138
is because of a man
who was hunting for submarines.

00:00:47.162 --> 00:00:51.372
It turns out, a guy who was trying
to develop the world's perfect sonar ping

00:00:51.396 --> 00:00:54.362
solved the problem of writing
pattern-free music.

00:00:54.386 --> 00:00:56.585
And that's what the topic
of the talk is today.

00:01:00.613 --> 00:01:02.865
So, recall that in sonar,

00:01:02.889 --> 00:01:05.766
you have a ship that sends
out some sound in the water,

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:07.613
and it listens for it -- an echo.

00:01:07.637 --> 00:01:10.646
The sound goes down, it echoes
back, it goes down, echoes back.

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:14.039
The time it takes the sound to come back
tells you how far away it is:

00:01:14.063 --> 00:01:15.505
if it comes at a higher pitch,

00:01:15.529 --> 00:01:17.607
it's because the thing
is moving toward you;

00:01:17.631 --> 00:01:20.569
if it comes back at a lower pitch,
it's moving away from you.

00:01:20.593 --> 00:01:22.714
So how would you design
a perfect sonar ping?

00:01:22.738 --> 00:01:26.219
Well, in the 1960s, a guy
by the name of John Costas

00:01:26.243 --> 00:01:30.079
was working on the Navy's extremely
expensive sonar system.

00:01:30.103 --> 00:01:33.765
It wasn't working, because the ping
they were using was inappropriate.

00:01:33.789 --> 00:01:36.095
It was a ping much
like the following here.

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:40.188
You can think of this as the notes
and this is time.

00:01:40.644 --> 00:01:42.374
(Piano notes play high to low)

00:01:42.398 --> 00:01:45.612
So that was the sonar ping
they were using, a down chirp.

00:01:45.636 --> 00:01:47.481
It turns out that's a really bad ping.

00:01:47.505 --> 00:01:50.447
Why? Because it looks
like shifts of itself.

00:01:50.471 --> 00:01:54.334
The relationship between the first
two notes is the same as the second two,

00:01:54.358 --> 00:01:55.523
and so forth.

00:01:55.547 --> 00:01:58.031
So he designed a different
kind of sonar ping,

00:01:58.055 --> 00:01:59.513
one that looks random.

00:01:59.537 --> 00:02:02.488
These look like a random pattern
of dots, but they're not.

00:02:02.512 --> 00:02:03.814
If you look very carefully,

00:02:03.838 --> 00:02:07.633
you may notice that, in fact,
the relationship between each pair of dots

00:02:07.657 --> 00:02:08.825
is distinct.

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:10.349
Nothing is ever repeated.

00:02:10.373 --> 00:02:13.070
The first two notes
and every other pair of notes

00:02:13.094 --> 00:02:14.721
have a different relationship.

00:02:16.025 --> 00:02:19.296
So the fact that we know
about these patterns is unusual.

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:21.511
John Costas is the inventor
of these patterns.

00:02:21.535 --> 00:02:24.107
This is a picture from 2006,
shortly before his death.

00:02:24.131 --> 00:02:27.040
He was the sonar engineer
working for the Navy.

00:02:27.064 --> 00:02:29.456
He was thinking about these patterns,

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:32.339
and he was, by hand, able to come
up with them to size 12 --

00:02:32.363 --> 00:02:33.655
12 by 12.

00:02:33.679 --> 00:02:36.600
He couldn't go any further
and thought maybe they don't exist

00:02:36.624 --> 00:02:37.938
in any size bigger than 12.

00:02:37.962 --> 00:02:40.585
So he wrote a letter
to the mathematician in the middle,

00:02:40.609 --> 00:02:43.680
a young mathematician in California
at the time, Solomon Golomb.

00:02:43.704 --> 00:02:45.259
It turns out that Solomon Golomb

00:02:45.283 --> 00:02:49.206
was one of the most gifted discrete
mathematicians of our time.

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:52.307
John asked Solomon if he could tell him
the right reference

00:02:52.331 --> 00:02:53.856
to where these patterns were.

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:55.041
There was no reference.

00:02:55.065 --> 00:02:57.441
Nobody had ever thought
about a repetition,

00:02:57.465 --> 00:02:59.286
a pattern-free structure before.

00:02:59.873 --> 00:03:02.993
So, Solomon Golomb spent the summer
thinking about the problem.

00:03:03.017 --> 00:03:06.147
And he relied on the mathematics
of this gentleman here,

00:03:06.171 --> 00:03:07.345
Évariste Galois.

00:03:07.369 --> 00:03:09.428
Now, Galois is a very
famous mathematician.

00:03:09.452 --> 00:03:12.585
He's famous because he invented
a whole branch of mathematics

00:03:12.609 --> 00:03:15.156
which bears his name,
called Galois field theory.

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:18.468
It's the mathematics of prime numbers.

00:03:18.901 --> 00:03:21.625
He's also famous
because of the way that he died.

00:03:22.256 --> 00:03:25.281
The story is that he stood up
for the honor of a young woman.

00:03:25.305 --> 00:03:28.093
He was challenged to a duel,
and he accepted.

00:03:28.983 --> 00:03:31.061
And shortly before the duel occurred,

00:03:31.085 --> 00:03:33.143
he wrote down all
of his mathematical ideas,

00:03:33.167 --> 00:03:36.098
sent letters to all of his friends,
saying "Please, please" --

00:03:36.122 --> 00:03:37.327
this was 200 years ago --

00:03:37.351 --> 00:03:40.549
"Please, please, see that these things
get published eventually."

00:03:40.573 --> 00:03:43.714
He then fought the duel,
was shot and died at age 20.

00:03:44.317 --> 00:03:46.999
The mathematics that runs
your cell phones, the internet,

00:03:47.023 --> 00:03:50.465
that allows us to communicate, DVDs,

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:53.317
all comes from the mind
of Évariste Galois,

00:03:53.341 --> 00:03:56.068
a mathematician who died 20 years young.

00:03:56.092 --> 00:03:58.455
When you talk about
the legacy that you leave ...

00:03:58.479 --> 00:04:00.551
Of course, he couldn't have
even anticipated

00:04:00.575 --> 00:04:02.656
the way that his mathematics
would be used.

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:05.205
Thankfully, his mathematics
was eventually published.

00:04:05.229 --> 00:04:08.830
Solomon Golomb realized that that was
exactly the mathematics needed

00:04:08.854 --> 00:04:12.242
to solve the problem of creating
a pattern-free structure.

00:04:12.266 --> 00:04:14.985
So he sent a letter back to John saying,

00:04:15.009 --> 00:04:18.513
"It turns out you can generate
these patterns using prime number theory."

00:04:18.537 --> 00:04:23.768
And John went about and solved
the sonar problem for the Navy.

00:04:24.735 --> 00:04:26.747
So what do these patterns look like again?

00:04:26.771 --> 00:04:27.953
Here's a pattern here.

00:04:27.977 --> 00:04:32.315
This is an 88-by-88-sized Costas array.

00:04:32.802 --> 00:04:34.981
It's generated in a very simple way.

00:04:35.005 --> 00:04:39.208
Elementary school mathematics
is sufficient to solve this problem.

00:04:39.232 --> 00:04:42.855
It's generated by repeatedly
multiplying by the number three:

00:04:42.879 --> 00:04:47.876
1, 3, 9, 27, 81, 243 ...

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:51.380
When I get to a number that's larger
than 89 which happens to be prime,

00:04:51.404 --> 00:04:54.257
I keep taking 89s away
until I get back below.

00:04:54.281 --> 00:04:58.123
And this will eventually fill
the entire grid, 88 by 88.

00:04:58.147 --> 00:05:01.280
There happen to be 88 notes on the piano.

00:05:01.304 --> 00:05:03.973
So today, we are going to have
the world premiere

00:05:03.997 --> 00:05:08.088
of the world's first
pattern-free piano sonata.

00:05:09.846 --> 00:05:11.988
So, back to the question of music:

00:05:12.012 --> 00:05:13.480
What makes music beautiful?

00:05:13.504 --> 00:05:16.536
Let's think about one of the most
beautiful pieces ever written,

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:21.183
Beethoven's Fifth Symphony
and the famous "da na na na!" motif.

00:05:21.207 --> 00:05:24.674
That motif occurs hundreds
of times in the symphony --

00:05:24.698 --> 00:05:26.846
hundreds of times
in the first movement alone

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:28.967
and also in all the other
movements as well.

00:05:28.991 --> 00:05:33.222
So the setting up of this repetition
is so important for beauty.

00:05:33.246 --> 00:05:37.039
If we think about random music
as being just random notes here,

00:05:37.063 --> 00:05:40.238
and over here, somehow, Beethoven's Fifth
in some kind of pattern,

00:05:40.262 --> 00:05:42.373
if we wrote completely pattern-free music,

00:05:42.397 --> 00:05:44.023
it would be way out on the tail.

00:05:44.047 --> 00:05:47.801
In fact, the end of the tail of music
would be these pattern-free structures.

00:05:47.825 --> 00:05:51.646
This music that we saw before,
those stars on the grid,

00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:55.018
is far, far, far from random.

00:05:55.042 --> 00:05:56.862
It's perfectly pattern-free.

00:05:57.310 --> 00:06:00.446
It turns out that musicologists --

00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:03.195
a famous composer by the name
of Arnold Schoenberg --

00:06:03.219 --> 00:06:06.543
thought of this in the 1930s,
'40s and '50s.

00:06:06.567 --> 00:06:09.699
His goal as a composer was to write music

00:06:09.723 --> 00:06:12.280
that would free music
from tonal structure.

00:06:12.304 --> 00:06:14.659
He called it the "emancipation
of the dissonance."

00:06:14.683 --> 00:06:16.882
He created these structures
called "tone rows."

00:06:16.906 --> 00:06:18.140
This is a tone row there.

00:06:18.164 --> 00:06:20.064
It sounds a lot like a Costas array.

00:06:20.088 --> 00:06:23.720
Unfortunately, he died 10 years
before Costas solved the problem

00:06:23.744 --> 00:06:26.304
of how you can mathematically
create these structures.

00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:32.102
Today, we're going to hear the world
premiere of the perfect ping.

00:06:32.126 --> 00:06:36.103
This is an 88-by-88-sized Costas array,

00:06:36.127 --> 00:06:37.722
mapped to notes on the piano,

00:06:37.746 --> 00:06:41.219
played using a structure called
a Golomb ruler for the rhythm,

00:06:41.243 --> 00:06:43.768
which means the starting
time of each pair of notes

00:06:43.792 --> 00:06:45.365
is distinct as well.

00:06:45.389 --> 00:06:48.098
This is mathematically almost impossible.

00:06:48.122 --> 00:06:50.933
Actually, computationally,
it would be impossible to create.

00:06:50.957 --> 00:06:54.388
Because of the mathematics
that was developed 200 years ago,

00:06:54.412 --> 00:06:57.074
through another mathematician
recently and an engineer,

00:06:57.098 --> 00:07:00.008
we were able to actually compose
this, or construct this,

00:07:00.032 --> 00:07:02.630
using multiplication by the number three.

00:07:02.654 --> 00:07:05.054
The point when you hear this music

00:07:05.078 --> 00:07:07.536
is not that it's supposed to be beautiful.

00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:11.492
This is supposed to be
the world's ugliest piece of music.

00:07:12.101 --> 00:07:15.306
In fact, it's music
that only a mathematician could write.

00:07:15.330 --> 00:07:16.353
(Laughter)

00:07:16.377 --> 00:07:19.200
When you're listening to this
piece of music, I implore you:

00:07:19.224 --> 00:07:20.907
try and find some repetition.

00:07:20.931 --> 00:07:23.397
Try and find something that you enjoy,

00:07:23.421 --> 00:07:26.407
and then revel in the fact
that you won't find it.

00:07:26.431 --> 00:07:27.773
(Laughter)

00:07:27.797 --> 00:07:30.408
So without further ado, Michael Linville,

00:07:30.432 --> 00:07:33.244
the [Dean] of Chamber Music
at the New World Symphony,

00:07:33.268 --> 00:07:36.625
will perform the world premiere
of the perfect ping.

00:07:37.686 --> 00:07:42.958
(Music)

00:09:19.312 --> 00:09:21.312
(Music ends)

00:09:24.687 --> 00:09:26.545
(Scott Rickard, off-screen) Thank you.

00:09:26.569 --> 00:09:31.469
(Applause)
