WEBVTT

00:00:00.051 --> 00:00:03.014
What I'm going to do is,
I'm going to explain to you

00:00:03.014 --> 00:00:05.066
an extreme green concept

00:00:05.066 --> 00:00:08.058
that was developed
at NASA's Glenn Research Center

00:00:08.058 --> 00:00:10.060
in Cleveland, Ohio.

00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:12.490
But before I do that, we have to go over

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:14.027
the definition of what green is,

00:00:14.027 --> 00:00:17.024
'cause a lot of us have a
different definition of it.

00:00:17.024 --> 00:00:19.017
Green. The product is created through

00:00:19.017 --> 00:00:21.480
environmentally and socially
conscious means.

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.668
There's plenty of things that
are being called green now.

00:00:24.668 --> 00:00:26.280
What does it actually mean?

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:29.923
We use three metrics to determine green.

00:00:29.923 --> 00:00:33.015
The first metric is: Is it sustainable?

00:00:33.015 --> 00:00:36.539
Which means, are you preserving
what you are doing for future use

00:00:36.539 --> 00:00:39.034
or for future generations?

00:00:39.034 --> 00:00:43.007
Is it alternative? Is it different
than what is being used today,

00:00:43.007 --> 00:00:45.812
or does it have a lower carbon footprint

00:00:45.812 --> 00:00:48.396
than what's used conventionally?

00:00:48.396 --> 00:00:51.231
And three: Is it renewable?

00:00:51.231 --> 00:00:54.987
Does it come from Earth's
natural replenishing resources,

00:00:54.987 --> 00:00:58.087
such as sun, wind and water?

00:00:58.087 --> 00:01:01.619
Now, my task at NASA is to develop

00:01:01.619 --> 00:01:04.815
the next generation of aviation fuels.

00:01:04.815 --> 00:01:07.644
Extreme green. Why aviation?

00:01:07.644 --> 00:01:11.001
The field of aviation uses
more fuel than just about

00:01:11.001 --> 00:01:16.017
every other combined. We
need to find an alternative.

00:01:16.017 --> 00:01:19.017
Also it's a national
aeronautics directive.

00:01:19.017 --> 00:01:21.685
One of the national aeronautics
goals is to develop

00:01:21.685 --> 00:01:24.381
the next generation of fuels, biofuels,

00:01:24.381 --> 00:01:28.091
using domestic and safe,
friendly resources.

00:01:28.091 --> 00:01:30.959
Now, combating that challenge

00:01:30.959 --> 00:01:33.849
we have to also meet
the big three metric —

00:01:33.849 --> 00:01:37.662
Actually, extreme green
for us is all three together;

00:01:37.662 --> 00:01:40.052
that's why you see the plus
there. I was told to say that.

00:01:40.052 --> 00:01:45.049
So it has to be the big three at
GRC. That's another metric.

00:01:45.049 --> 00:01:51.000
Ninety-seven percent of the
world's water is saltwater.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.010
How about we use that?
Combine that with number three.

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:58.042
Do not use arable land.

00:01:58.042 --> 00:02:00.222
Because crops are already
growing on that land

00:02:00.222 --> 00:02:03.019
that's very scarce around the world.

00:02:03.019 --> 00:02:06.026
Number two: Don't compete with food crops.

00:02:06.026 --> 00:02:10.443
That's already a well established
entity, they don't need another entry.

00:02:10.443 --> 00:02:14.391
And lastly the most precious
resource we have on this Earth

00:02:14.391 --> 00:02:19.051
is fresh water. Don't use fresh water.

00:02:19.051 --> 00:02:22.022
If 97.5 percent
of the world's water is saltwater,

00:02:22.022 --> 00:02:25.299
2.5 percent is fresh water.
Less than a half percent

00:02:25.299 --> 00:02:27.060
of that is accessible for human use.

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:31.021
But 60 percent of the population
lives within that one percent.

00:02:31.021 --> 00:02:36.013
So, combating my problem was,
now I have to be extreme green

00:02:36.013 --> 00:02:38.261
and meet the big three.
Ladies and gentlemen,

00:02:38.261 --> 00:02:42.007
welcome to the GreenLab Research Facility.

00:02:42.007 --> 00:02:44.942
This is a facility dedicated
to the next generation

00:02:44.942 --> 00:02:48.087
of aviation fuels using halophytes.

00:02:48.087 --> 00:02:51.065
A halophyte is a salt-tolerating plant.

00:02:51.065 --> 00:02:55.093
Most plants don't like salt,
but halophytes tolerate salt.

00:02:55.093 --> 00:02:58.088
We also are using weeds

00:02:58.088 --> 00:03:01.019
and we are also using algae.

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:03.010
The good thing about our lab is, we've had

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:06.020
3,600 visitors in the last two years.

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:08.022
Why do you think that's so?

00:03:08.022 --> 00:03:12.028
Because we are on to something special.

00:03:12.028 --> 00:03:14.597
So, in the lower you see
the GreenLab obviously,

00:03:14.597 --> 00:03:17.049
and on the right hand
side you'll see algae.

00:03:17.049 --> 00:03:20.002
If you are into the business
of the next generation

00:03:20.002 --> 00:03:22.322
of aviation fuels, algae
is a viable option,

00:03:22.322 --> 00:03:24.001
there's a lot of funding right now,

00:03:24.001 --> 00:03:26.022
and we have an algae to fuels program.

00:03:26.022 --> 00:03:28.022
There's two types of algae growing.

00:03:28.022 --> 00:03:31.015
One is a closed photobioreactor
that you see here,

00:03:31.015 --> 00:03:35.036
and what you see on the other
side is our species —

00:03:35.036 --> 00:03:39.006
we are currently using a species
called Scenedesmus dimorphus.

00:03:39.006 --> 00:03:43.312
Our job at NASA is to take the
experimental and computational

00:03:43.312 --> 00:03:48.007
and make a better mixing for
the closed photobioreactors.

00:03:48.007 --> 00:03:50.044
Now the problems with closed
photobioreactors are:

00:03:50.044 --> 00:03:52.775
They are quite expensive,
they are automated,

00:03:52.775 --> 00:03:55.803
and it's very difficult
to get them in large scale.

00:03:55.803 --> 00:03:57.428
So on large scale what do they use?

00:03:57.428 --> 00:04:00.921
We use open pond systems.
Now, around the world

00:04:00.921 --> 00:04:04.442
they are growing algae,
with this racetrack design

00:04:04.442 --> 00:04:06.891
that you see here. Looks like an oval with

00:04:06.891 --> 00:04:09.028
a paddle wheel and mixes really well,

00:04:09.028 --> 00:04:13.086
but when it gets around the last turn,
which I call turn four — it's stagnant.

00:04:13.086 --> 00:04:15.076
We actually have a solution for that.

00:04:15.076 --> 00:04:18.040
In the GreenLab in our open pond system

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:21.055
we use something that happens
in nature: waves.

00:04:21.055 --> 00:04:24.747
We actually use wave technology
on our open pond systems.

00:04:24.747 --> 00:04:29.431
We have 95 percent mixing
and our lipid content is higher

00:04:29.431 --> 00:04:32.049
than a closed photobioreactor system,

00:04:32.049 --> 00:04:34.030
which we think is significant.

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:38.062
There is a drawback to algae,
however: It's very expensive.

00:04:38.062 --> 00:04:43.165
Is there a way to produce
algae inexpensively?

00:04:43.165 --> 00:04:45.026
And the answer is: yes.

00:04:45.026 --> 00:04:48.049
We do the same thing
we do with halophytes,

00:04:48.049 --> 00:04:52.004
and that is: climatic adaptation.

00:04:52.004 --> 00:04:54.816
In our GreenLab we have
six primary ecosystems

00:04:54.816 --> 00:04:58.787
that range from freshwater
all the way to saltwater.

00:04:58.787 --> 00:05:02.546
What we do: We take a potential
species, we start at freshwater,

00:05:02.546 --> 00:05:05.274
we add a little bit more salt,
when the second tank here

00:05:05.274 --> 00:05:07.406
will be the same ecosystem as Brazil —

00:05:07.406 --> 00:05:10.502
right next to the sugar cane
fields you can have our plants —

00:05:10.502 --> 00:05:14.745
the next tank represents Africa,
the next tank represents Arizona,

00:05:14.745 --> 00:05:17.056
the next tank represents Florida,

00:05:17.056 --> 00:05:20.919
and the next tank represents
California or the open ocean.

00:05:20.919 --> 00:05:25.014
What we are trying to do is to
come up with a single species

00:05:25.014 --> 00:05:31.019
that can survive anywhere in the
world, where there's barren desert.

00:05:31.019 --> 00:05:33.057
We are being very successful so far.

00:05:33.057 --> 00:05:35.701
Now, here's one of the problems.

00:05:35.701 --> 00:05:41.428
If you are a farmer, you need five things
to be successful: You need seeds,

00:05:41.428 --> 00:05:45.043
you need soil, you need
water and you need sun,

00:05:45.043 --> 00:05:48.613
and the last thing that you
need is fertilizer.

00:05:48.613 --> 00:05:52.168
Most people use chemical fertilizers.
But guess what?

00:05:52.168 --> 00:05:54.868
We do not use chemical fertilizer.

00:05:54.868 --> 00:06:00.023
Wait a second! I just saw lots of greenery
in your GreenLab. You have to use fertilizer.

00:06:00.023 --> 00:06:04.228
Believe it or not, in our analysis
of our saltwater ecosystems

00:06:04.228 --> 00:06:08.028
80 percent of what we need
are in these tanks themselves.

00:06:08.028 --> 00:06:12.027
The 20 percent that's missing
is nitrogen and phosphorous.

00:06:12.027 --> 00:06:14.083
We have a natural solution: fish.

00:06:14.083 --> 00:06:17.971
No we don't cut up the fish
and put them in there.

00:06:17.971 --> 00:06:21.854
Fish waste is what we use.
As a matter of fact

00:06:21.854 --> 00:06:26.019
we use freshwater mollies, that we've
used our climatic adaptation technique

00:06:26.019 --> 00:06:29.041
from freshwater all the way to seawater.

00:06:29.041 --> 00:06:36.037
Freshwater mollies: cheap,
they love to make babies,

00:06:36.037 --> 00:06:37.846
and they love to go to the bathroom.

00:06:37.846 --> 00:06:40.001
And the more they go to the
bathroom, the more fertilizer we get,

00:06:40.001 --> 00:06:42.540
the better off we are, believe it or not.

00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:47.805
It should be noted that we use
sand as our soil,

00:06:47.805 --> 00:06:52.030
regular beach sand. Fossilized coral.

00:06:52.030 --> 00:06:56.001
So a lot of people ask me,
"How did you get started?"

00:06:56.001 --> 00:07:01.006
Well, we got started in what we
call the indoor biofuels lab.

00:07:01.006 --> 00:07:05.401
It's a seedling lab. We have 26
different species of halophytes,

00:07:05.412 --> 00:07:08.684
and five are winners. What we do here is —

00:07:08.684 --> 00:07:11.509
actually it should be called
a death lab, 'cause we try to

00:07:11.509 --> 00:07:14.098
kill the seedlings, make them rough —

00:07:14.098 --> 00:07:16.418
and then we come to the GreenLab.

00:07:16.418 --> 00:07:18.176
What you see in the lower corner

00:07:18.176 --> 00:07:20.364
is a wastewater treatment plant experiment

00:07:20.364 --> 00:07:24.057
that we are growing, a macro-algae
that I'll talk about in a minute.

00:07:24.057 --> 00:07:28.043
And lastly, it's me actually working
in the lab to prove to you I do work,

00:07:28.043 --> 00:07:31.775
I don't just talk about what I do.

00:07:31.775 --> 00:07:35.005
Here's the plant species.
Salicornia virginica.

00:07:35.005 --> 00:07:38.564
It's a wonderful plant. I love that plant.

00:07:38.564 --> 00:07:42.030
Everywhere we go we see it. It's
all over the place, from Maine

00:07:42.030 --> 00:07:45.041
all the way to California.
We love that plant.

00:07:45.041 --> 00:07:50.006
Second is Salicornia bigelovii. Very
difficult to get around the world.

00:07:50.006 --> 00:07:52.052
It is the highest lipid
content that we have,

00:07:52.052 --> 00:07:56.042
but it has a shortcoming: It's short.

00:07:56.042 --> 00:08:01.163
Now you take europaea, which is the
largest or the tallest plant that we have.

00:08:01.163 --> 00:08:03.081
And what we are trying to do

00:08:03.081 --> 00:08:07.462
with natural selection or adaptive
biology — combine all three

00:08:07.462 --> 00:08:11.578
to make a high-growth, high-lipid plant.

00:08:11.578 --> 00:08:18.842
Next, when a hurricane decimated the
Delaware Bay — soybean fields gone —

00:08:18.842 --> 00:08:21.706
we came up with an idea:
Can you have a plant

00:08:21.706 --> 00:08:27.017
that has a land reclamation positive
in Delaware? And the answer is yes.

00:08:27.017 --> 00:08:30.991
It's called seashore mallow.
Kosteletzkya virginica —

00:08:30.991 --> 00:08:34.009
say that five times fast if you can.

00:08:34.009 --> 00:08:41.597
This is a 100 percent usable plant. The
seeds: biofuels. The rest: cattle feed.

00:08:41.597 --> 00:08:45.036
It's there for 10 years;
it's working very well.

00:08:45.036 --> 00:08:48.363
Now we get to Chaetomorpha.

00:08:48.363 --> 00:08:51.585
This is a macro-algae that loves

00:08:51.585 --> 00:08:54.007
excess nutrients. If you
are in the aquarium industry

00:08:54.007 --> 00:08:56.818
you know we use it
to clean up dirty tanks.

00:08:56.818 --> 00:09:01.029
This species is so significant to us.

00:09:01.029 --> 00:09:05.000
The properties are very close to plastic.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:10.378
We are trying right now to convert
this macro-algae into a bioplastic.

00:09:10.378 --> 00:09:15.051
If we are successful, we will
revolutionize the plastics industry.

00:09:15.051 --> 00:09:18.573
So, we have a seed to fuel program.

00:09:18.573 --> 00:09:21.530
We have to do something with
this biomass that we have.

00:09:21.530 --> 00:09:26.039
And so we do G.C. extraction, lipid
optimization, so on and so forth,

00:09:26.039 --> 00:09:29.726
because our goal really is to come up with

00:09:29.726 --> 00:09:33.636
the next generation of aviation fuels,
aviation specifics, so on and so forth.

00:09:33.636 --> 00:09:38.056
So far we talked about water and fuel,

00:09:38.056 --> 00:09:45.000
but along the way we found out
something interesting about Salicornia:

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:48.686
It's a food product.

00:09:48.686 --> 00:09:51.499
So we talk about ideas
worth spreading, right?

00:09:51.499 --> 00:09:58.353
How about this: In sub-Saharan
Africa, next to the sea, saltwater,

00:09:58.353 --> 00:10:03.212
barren desert,
how about we take that plant,

00:10:03.212 --> 00:10:08.044
plant it, half use for food,
half use for fuel.

00:10:08.044 --> 00:10:11.845
We can make that happen, inexpensively.

00:10:11.845 --> 00:10:14.543
You can see
there's a greenhouse in Germany

00:10:14.543 --> 00:10:17.007
that sells it as a health food product.

00:10:17.007 --> 00:10:22.233
This is harvested, and in the middle here
is a shrimp dish, and it's being pickled.

00:10:22.233 --> 00:10:26.846
So I have to tell you a joke.
Salicornia is known as sea beans,

00:10:26.846 --> 00:10:30.319
saltwater asparagus and pickle weed.

00:10:30.319 --> 00:10:33.050
So we are pickling pickle
weed in the middle.

00:10:33.050 --> 00:10:35.852
Oh, I thought it was funny. (Laughter)

00:10:35.852 --> 00:10:39.225
And at the bottom is seaman's mustard.
It does make sense,

00:10:39.225 --> 00:10:41.612
this is a logical snack. You have mustard,

00:10:41.612 --> 00:10:44.760
you are a seaman, you see the
halophyte, you mix it together,

00:10:44.760 --> 00:10:47.022
it's a great snack with some crackers.

00:10:47.022 --> 00:10:54.022
And last, garlic with Salicornia,
which is what I like.

00:10:54.022 --> 00:10:58.997
So, water, fuel and food.

00:10:58.997 --> 00:11:02.548
None of this is possible
without the GreenLab team.

00:11:02.548 --> 00:11:07.529
Just like the Miami Heat has the big
three, we have the big three at NASA GRC.

00:11:07.529 --> 00:11:13.008
That's myself, professor Bob Hendricks,
our fearless leader, and Dr. Arnon Chait.

00:11:13.008 --> 00:11:17.537
The backbone of the GreenLab is students.

00:11:17.537 --> 00:11:21.452
Over the last two years
we've had 35 different students

00:11:21.452 --> 00:11:24.607
from around the world working at GreenLab.

00:11:24.607 --> 00:11:29.016
As a matter fact my division chief says
a lot, "You have a green university."

00:11:29.016 --> 00:11:31.551
I say, "I'm okay with that,
'cause we are nurturing

00:11:31.551 --> 00:11:36.575
the next generation of extreme
green thinkers, which is significant."

00:11:36.575 --> 00:11:41.896
So, in first summary I presented
to you what we think

00:11:41.896 --> 00:11:48.023
is a global solution
for food, fuel and water.

00:11:48.023 --> 00:11:51.017
There's something missing to be complete.

00:11:51.017 --> 00:11:55.808
Clearly we use electricity.
We have a solution for you —

00:11:55.808 --> 00:11:59.057
We're using clean energy sources here.

00:11:59.057 --> 00:12:03.478
So, we have two wind turbines
connected to the GreenLab,

00:12:03.478 --> 00:12:07.005
we have four or five more
hopefully coming soon.

00:12:07.005 --> 00:12:10.615
We are also using something
that is quite interesting —

00:12:10.615 --> 00:12:15.238
there is a solar array field at
NASA's Glenn Research Center,

00:12:15.238 --> 00:12:18.380
hasn't been used for 15 years.

00:12:18.380 --> 00:12:21.143
Along with some of my electrical
engineering colleagues,

00:12:21.143 --> 00:12:23.286
we realized that they are still viable,

00:12:23.286 --> 00:12:26.042
so we are refurbishing them right now.

00:12:26.042 --> 00:12:31.078
In about 30 days or so they'll be
connected to the GreenLab.

00:12:31.078 --> 00:12:34.004
And the reason why you see
red, red and yellow, is

00:12:34.004 --> 00:12:37.271
a lot of people think NASA employees
don't work on Saturday —

00:12:37.271 --> 00:12:40.189
This is a picture taken on Saturday.

00:12:40.189 --> 00:12:44.814
There are no cars around, but you see my truck
in yellow. I work on Saturday. (Laughter)

00:12:44.814 --> 00:12:46.647
This is a proof to you that I'm working.

00:12:46.647 --> 00:12:50.547
'Cause we do what it takes to get the
job done, most people know that.

00:12:50.547 --> 00:12:53.425
Here's a concept with this:

00:12:53.425 --> 00:12:58.981
We are using the GreenLab
for a micro-grid test bed

00:12:58.981 --> 00:13:03.044
for the smart grid concept in Ohio.

00:13:03.044 --> 00:13:08.951
We have the ability to do that,
and I think it's going to work.

00:13:08.951 --> 00:13:14.044
So, GreenLab Research Facility.

00:13:14.044 --> 00:13:19.067
A self-sustainable renewable energy
ecosystem was presented today.

00:13:19.067 --> 00:13:25.014
We really, really hope this
concept catches on worldwide.

00:13:25.014 --> 00:13:34.064
We think we have a solution for food,
water, fuel and now energy. Complete.

00:13:34.064 --> 00:13:40.189
It's extreme green, it's sustainable,
alternative and renewable

00:13:40.189 --> 00:13:44.027
and it meets the big three at GRC:

00:13:44.027 --> 00:13:49.018
Don't use arable land, don't
compete with food crops,

00:13:49.018 --> 00:13:52.080
and most of all, don't use fresh water.

00:13:52.080 --> 00:13:57.054
So I get a lot of questions about,
"What are you doing in that lab?"

00:13:57.054 --> 00:14:02.807
And I usually say, "None of your business,
that's what I'm doing in the lab." (Laughter)

00:14:02.807 --> 00:14:06.350
And believe it or not, my number one goal

00:14:06.350 --> 00:14:09.060
for working on this project is

00:14:09.060 --> 00:14:14.011
I want to help save the world.
