WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
It is actually a reality today

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
that you can download products from the Web --

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
product data, I should say, from the Web --

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
perhaps tweak it and personalize it

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
to your own preference or your own taste,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
and have that information sent

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
to a desktop machine

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
that will fabricate it for you on the spot.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
We can actually build for you,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
very rapidly,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
a physical object.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
And the reason we can do this

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
is through an emerging technology

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
called additive manufacturing,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
or 3D printing.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
This is a 3D printer.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
They have been around

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
for almost 30 years now,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
which is quite amazing to think of,

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
but they're only just starting

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
to filter into the public arena.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
And typically, you would take data,

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
like the data of a pen here,

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
which would be a geometric representation of that product in 3D,

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
and we would pass that data with material

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
into a machine.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
And a process that would happen in the machine

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
would mean layer by layer that product would be built.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
And we can take out the physical product,

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
and ready to use,

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
or to, perhaps, assemble into something else.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
But if these machines have been around for almost 30 years,

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
why don't we know about them?

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
Because typically they've been too inefficient,

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
inaccessible,

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
they've not been fast enough,

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
they've been quite expensive.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
But today,

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
it is becoming a reality

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
that they are now becoming successful.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
Many barriers are breaking down.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
That means that you guys

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
will soon be able to access one of these machines,

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
if not this minute.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
And it will change and disrupt

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
the landscape of manufacturing,

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
and most certainly our lives, our businesses

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
and the lives of our children.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
So how does it work?

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
It typically reads CAD data,

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
which is a product design data

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
created on professional product design programs.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
And here you can see an engineer --

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
it could be an architect or it could be a professional product designer --

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
create a product in 3D.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
And this data gets sent to a machine

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000
that slices the data

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
into two-dimensional representations of that product

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
all the way through --

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
almost like slicing it like salami.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
And that data, layer by layer, gets passed through the machine,

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
starting at the base of the product

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
and depositing material, layer upon layer,

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.000
infusing the new layer of materials to the old layer

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
in an additive process.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000
And this material that's deposited

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
either starts as a liquid form

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000
or a material powder form.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
And the bonding process can happen

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
by either melting and depositing or depositing then melting.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
In this case, we can see a laser sintering machine developed by EOS.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
It's actually using a laser

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000
to fuse the new layer of material to the old layer.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
And over time --

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000
quite rapidly actually, in a number of hours --

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000
we can build a physical product,

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000
ready to take out of the machine and use.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.000
And this is quite an extraordinary idea,

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000
but it is reality today.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000
So all these products that you can see on the screen

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
were made in the same way.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
They were all 3D printed.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000
And you can see,

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000
they're ranging from shoes,

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.000
rings that were made out of stainless steal,

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
phone covers out of plastic,

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000
all the way through to spinal implants, for example,

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000
that were created out of medical-grade titanium,

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000
and engine parts.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000
But what you'll notice about all of these products

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000
is they're very, very intricate.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.000
The design is quite extraordinary.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000
Because we're taking this data in 3D form,

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.000
slicing it up before it gets past the machine,

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000
we can actually create structures

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000
that are more intricate

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
than any other manufacturing technology --

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.000
or, in fact, are impossible to build in any other way.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.000
And you can create parts with moving components,

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000
hinges, parts within parts.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000
So in some cases, we can abolish totally

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000
the need for manual labor.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000
It sounds great.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000
It is great.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000
We can have 3D printers today

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000
that build structures like these.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.000
This is almost three meters high.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000
And this was built

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000
by depositing artificial sandstone layer upon layer

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:31.000
in layers of about five millimeters to 10 mm in thickness --

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000
slowly growing this structure.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000
This was created by an architectural firm called Shiro.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000
And you can actually walk into it.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000
And on the other end of the spectrum,

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000
this is a microstructure.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000
It's created depositing layers

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.000
of about four microns.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.000
So really the resolution is quite incredible.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
The detail that you can get today

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.000
is quite amazing.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000
So who's using it?

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000
Typically, because we can create products very rapidly,

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000
it's been used by product designers,

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000
or anyone who wanted to prototype a product

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000
and very quickly create or reiterate a design.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:13.000
And actually what's quite amazing about this technology as well

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.000
is that you can create bespoke products en masse.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.000
There's very little economies of scale.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.000
So you can now create one-offs very easily.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000
Architects, for example,

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000
they want to create prototypes of buildings.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000
Again you can see,

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.000
this is a building of the Free University in Berlin

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.000
and it was designed by Foster and Partners.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.000
Again, not buildable in any other way.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.000
And very hard to even create this by hand.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.000
Now this is an engine component.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.000
It was developed by a company called Within Technologies

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.000
and 3T RPD.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000
It's very, very, very detailed

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.000
inside with the design.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000
Now 3D printing

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000
can break away barriers in design

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000
which challenge the constraints

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000
of mass production.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.000
If we slice into this product which is actually sitting here,

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:09.000
you can see that it has a number of cooling channels pass through it,

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.000
which means it's a more efficient product.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.000
You can't create this with standard manufacturing techniques

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000
even if you tried to do it manually.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.000
It's more efficient

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.000
because we can now create all these cavities within the object

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000
that cool fluid.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000
And it's used by aerospace

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.000
and automotive.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.000
It's a lighter part

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000
and it uses less material waste.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.000
So it's overall performance and efficiency

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:40.000
just exceeds standard mass produced products.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000
And then taking this idea

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000
of creating a very detailed structure,

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.000
we can apply it to honeycomb structures

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:49.000
and use them within implants.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000
Typically an implant

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000
is more effective within the body

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000
if it's more porous,

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.000
because our body tissue will grow into it.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.000
There's a lower chance of rejection.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.000
But it's very hard to create that in standard ways.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.000
With 3D printing,

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.000
we're seeing today

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000
that we can create much better implants.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000
And in fact, because we can create

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.000
bespoke products en masse, one-offs,

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.000
we can create implants

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.000
that are specific to individuals.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.000
So as you can see,

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:24.000
this technology and the quality of what comes out of the machines is fantastic.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.000
And we're starting to see it being used

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.000
for final end products.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000
And in fact, as the detail is improving,

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000
the quality is improving,

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.000
the price of the machines are falling

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.000
and they're becoming quicker.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.000
They're also now small enough

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.000
to sit on a desktop.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.000
You can buy a machine today for about $300

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.000
that you can create yourself,

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.000
which is quite incredible.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.000
But then it begs the question,

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:52.000
why don't we all have one in our home?

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000
Because, simply, most of us here today

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.000
don't know how to create the data

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.000
that a 3D printer reads.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000
If I gave you a 3D printer,

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000
you wouldn't know how to direct it

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000
to make what you want it to.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.000
But there are more and more

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.000
technologies, software and processes today

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.000
that are breaking down those barriers.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000
I believe we're at a tipping point

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.000
where this is now something

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.000
that we can't avoid.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.000
This technology

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.000
is really going to disrupt

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.000
the landscape of manufacturing

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.000
and, I believe, cause a revolution

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.000
in manufacturing.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.000
So today,

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000
you can download products from the Web --

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.000
anything you would have on your desktop,

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.000
like pens, whistles, lemon squeezers.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.000
You can use software like Google SketchUp

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.000
to create products from scratch

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:44.000
very easily.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000
3D printing can be also used

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:49.000
to download spare parts from the Web.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000
So imagine you have, say,

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.000
a Hoover in your home

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:56.000
and it has broken down. You need a spare part,

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:59.000
but you realize that Hoover's been discontinued.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.000
Can you imagine going online --

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.000
this is a reality --

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.000
and finding that spare part

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.000
from a database of geometries

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.000
of that discontinued product

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.000
and downloading that information, that data,

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.000
and having the product made for you at home,

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:17.000
ready to use, on your demand?

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.000
And in fact, because we can create spare parts

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.000
with things the machines

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.000
are quite literally making themselves.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:26.000
You're having machines fabricate themselves.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.000
These are parts of a RepRap machine,

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:31.000
which is a kind of desktop printer.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:34.000
But what interests my company the most

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.000
is the fact that you can create

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.000
individual unique products en masse.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.000
There's no need to do a run

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.000
of thousands of millions

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:46.000
or send that product to be injection molded in China.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:50.000
You can just make it physically on the spot.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.000
Which means

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.000
that we can now present to the public

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:57.000
the next generation of customization.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.000
This is something that is now possible today,

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.000
that you can direct personally

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:04.000
how you want your products to look.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.000
We're all familiar with the idea

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.000
of customization or personalization.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.000
Brands like Nike are doing it.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.000
It's all over the Web.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.000
In fact, every major household name

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.000
is allowing you

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.000
to interact with their products

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.000
on a daily basis --

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.000
all the way from Smart Cars

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.000
to Prada

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.000
to Ray Ban, for example.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.000
But this is not really mass customization;

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.000
it's known as variant production,

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:33.000
variations of the same product.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:36.000
What you could do is really influence your product now

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:39.000
and shape-manipulate your product.

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.000
I'm not sure about you guys,

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.000
but I've had experiences

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.000
when I've walked into a store and I've know exactly what I've wanted

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:48.000
and I've searched everywhere for that perfect lamp

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.000
that I know where I want to sit in my house

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.000
and I just can't find the right thing,

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:55.000
or that perfect piece of jewelry

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.000
as a gift or for myself.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.000
Imagine that you can now

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:02.000
engage with a brand

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:04.000
and interact,

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:07.000
so that you can pass your personal attributes

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:11.000
to the products that you're about to buy.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.000
You can today

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.000
download a product with software like this,

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.000
view the product in 3D.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.000
This is the sort of 3D data

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.000
that a machine will read.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.000
This is a lamp.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.000
And you can start iterating the design.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.000
You can direct what color that product will be,

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.000
perhaps what material.

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:32.000
And also, you can engage in shape manipulation of that product,

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.000
but within boundaries that are safe.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:37.000
Because obviously the public are not professional product designers.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:40.000
The piece of software will keep an individual

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:44.000
within the bounds of the possible.

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:46.000
And when somebody is ready to purchase the product

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.000
in their personalized design,

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:51.000
they click "Enter" and this data gets converted

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:55.000
into the data that a 3D printer reads

00:11:55.000 --> 00:12:00.000
and gets passed to a 3D printer,

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:03.000
perhaps on someone's desktop.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:05.000
But I don't think that that's immediate.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:07.000
I don't think that will happen soon.

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:09.000
What's more likely, and we're seeing it today,

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:11.000
is that data gets sent

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.000
to a local manufacturing center.

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:16.000
This means lower carbon footprint.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:19.000
We're now, instead of shipping a product across the world,

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:21.000
we're sending data across the Internet.

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:24.000
Here's the product being built.

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:26.000
You can see, this came out of the machine in one piece

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.000
and the electronics were inserted later.

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.000
It's this lamp, as you can see here.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.000
So as long as you have the data,

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.000
you can create the part on demand.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.000
And you don't necessarily need to use this

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.000
for just aesthetic customization,

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.000
you can use it for functional customization,

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:42.000
scanning parts of the body

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:44.000
and creating things that are made to fit.

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:47.000
So we can run this through to something like prosthetics,

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:50.000
which is highly specialized to an individual's handicap.

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:54.000
Or we can create very specific prosthetics

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.000
for that individual.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.000
Scanning teeth today,

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.000
you can have your teeth scanned

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.000
and dental coatings made in this way to fit you.

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:04.000
While you wait at the dentist,

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:07.000
a machine will quietly be creating this for you

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:09.000
ready to insert in the teeth.

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:13.000
And the idea of now creating implants,

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:16.000
scanning data, an MRI scan of somebody

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.000
can now be converted into 3D data

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:22.000
and we can create very specific implants for them.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.000
And applying this

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.000
to the idea of building up what's in our bodies.

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:29.000
You know, this is pair of lungs and the bronchial tree.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:31.000
It's very intricate.

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.000
You couldn't really create this or simulate it in any other way.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:35.000
But with MRI data,

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:37.000
we can just build the product,

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:39.000
as you can see, very intricately.

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:43.000
Using this process,

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:46.000
pioneers in the industry are layering up cells today.

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:49.000
So one of the pioneers, for example, is Dr. Anthony Atala,

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:51.000
and he has been working

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:53.000
on layering cells to create body parts --

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:57.000
bladders, valves, kidneys.

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:59.000
Now this is not something that's ready for the public,

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:02.000
but it is in working progress.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.000
So just to finalize, we're all individual.

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:07.000
We all have different preferences, different needs.

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:09.000
We like different things.

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:11.000
We're all different sizes and our companies the same.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:13.000
Businesses want different things.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:15.000
Without a doubt in my mind,

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:17.000
I believe that this technology

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:19.000
is going to cause a manufacturing revolution

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:22.000
and will change the landscape of manufacturing as we know it.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:24.000
Thank you.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:28.000
(Applause)
