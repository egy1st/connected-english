WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.976
I think we have to do something

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.976
about a piece of the culture
of medicine that has to change.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.976
And I think it starts
with one physician, and that's me.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:09.976
And maybe I've been around long enough

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.667
that I can afford to give away
some of my false prestige

00:00:12.691 --> 00:00:13.976
to be able to do that.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.096
Before I actually begin
the meat of my talk,

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:17.976
let's begin with a bit of baseball.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.976
Hey, why not?

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.976
We're near the end, we're getting
close to the World Series.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.976
We all love baseball, don't we?

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:27.976
(Laughter)

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.976
Baseball is filled
with some amazing statistics.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.976
And there's hundreds of them.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
"Moneyball" is about to come out,
and it's all about statistics

00:00:37.024 --> 00:00:39.501
and using statistics to build
a great baseball team.

00:00:39.525 --> 00:00:41.976
I'm going to focus on one stat

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.976
that I hope a lot of you have heard of.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:45.976
It's called batting average.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.976
So we talk about a 300,
a batter who bats 300.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.976
That means that ballplayer
batted safely, hit safely

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.976
three times out of 10 at bats.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
That means hit the ball into the outfield,

00:00:58.024 --> 00:00:59.976
it dropped, it didn't get caught,

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.239
and whoever tried to throw it to first
base didn't get there in time

00:01:03.263 --> 00:01:04.976
and the runner was safe.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.976
Three times out of 10.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.976
Do you know what they call a 300 hitter

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.976
in Major League Baseball?

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.976
Good, really good,

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.976
maybe an all-star.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:20.976
Do you know what they call

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.976
a 400 baseball hitter?

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.976
That's somebody who hit, by the way,

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:26.976
four times safely out of every 10.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.976
Legendary --

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.976
as in Ted Williams legendary --

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.976
the last Major League Baseball player

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.976
to hit over 400 during a regular season.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.334
Now let's take this back
into my world of medicine

00:01:39.358 --> 00:01:40.976
where I'm a lot more comfortable,

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.976
or perhaps a bit less comfortable

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.976
after what I'm going to talk to you about.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.976
Suppose you have appendicitis

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.976
and you're referred to a surgeon

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.976
who's batting 400 on appendectomies.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.976
(Laughter)

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.976
Somehow this isn't working out, is it?

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.976
Now suppose you live

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.976
in a certain part
of a certain remote place

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.976
and you have a loved one

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.976
who has blockages in two coronary arteries

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.976
and your family doctor refers
that loved one to a cardiologist

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.976
who's batting 200 on angioplasties.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.976
But, but, you know what?

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.976
She's doing a lot better this year.
She's on the comeback trail.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.976
And she's hitting a 257.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.976
Somehow this isn't working.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.976
But I'm going to ask you a question.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.976
What do you think a batting average

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.143
for a cardiac surgeon
or a nurse practitioner

00:02:30.167 --> 00:02:31.976
or an orthopedic surgeon,

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.976
an OBGYN, a paramedic

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.976
is supposed to be?

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.976
1,000, very good.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.976
Now truth of the matter is,

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.976
nobody knows in all of medicine

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.976
what a good surgeon

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.976
or physician or paramedic

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.976
is supposed to bat.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.976
What we do though is we send
each one of them, including myself,

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.976
out into the world

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.976
with the admonition, be perfect.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.976
Never ever, ever make a mistake,

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.143
but you worry about the details,
about how that's going to happen.

00:03:01.167 --> 00:03:03.143
And that was the message that I absorbed

00:03:03.167 --> 00:03:04.976
when I was in med school.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.976
I was an obsessive compulsive student.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.976
In high school, a classmate once said

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.286
that Brian Goldman would study
for a blood test.

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:15.976
(Laughter)

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.976
And so I did.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.976
And I studied in my little garret

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.524
at the nurses' residence
at Toronto General Hospital,

00:03:22.548 --> 00:03:23.976
not far from here.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.976
And I memorized everything.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:27.976
I memorized in my anatomy class

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
the origins and exertions of every muscle,

00:03:30.024 --> 00:03:32.976
every branch of every artery
that came off the aorta,

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.976
differential diagnoses obscure and common.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.976
I even knew the differential diagnosis

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000
in how to classify renal tubular acidosis.

00:03:40.024 --> 00:03:41.976
And all the while,

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.976
I was amassing more and more knowledge.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:45.976
And I did well, I graduated with honors,

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:47.976
cum laude.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.976
And I came out of medical school

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.976
with the impression

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.429
that if I memorized everything
and knew everything,

00:03:55.453 --> 00:03:56.976
or as much as possible,

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.976
as close to everything as possible,

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.976
that it would immunize me
against making mistakes.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:03.976
And it worked

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.976
for a while,

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.976
until I met Mrs. Drucker.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:11.976
I was a resident at a teaching
hospital here in Toronto

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.976
when Mrs. Drucker was brought
to the emergency department

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:16.976
of the hospital where I was working.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.476
At the time I was assigned
to the cardiology service

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:20.976
on a cardiology rotation.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:22.976
And it was my job,

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.715
when the emergency staff called
for a cardiology consult,

00:04:25.739 --> 00:04:27.976
to see that patient in emerg.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:29.976
and to report back to my attending.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.976
And I saw Mrs. Drucker,
and she was breathless.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.976
And when I listened to her,
she was making a wheezy sound.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:37.976
And when I listened to her
chest with a stethoscope,

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:39.976
I could hear crackly sounds on both sides

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.976
that told me that she was in congestive
heart failure.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.976
This is a condition
in which the heart fails,

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:47.976
and instead of being able
to pump all the blood forward,

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.976
some of the blood backs up into the lung,
the lungs fill up with blood,

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.096
and that's why you have
shortness of breath.

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:55.976
And that wasn't a difficult
diagnosis to make.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.976
I made it and I set to work treating her.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.976
I gave her aspirin. I gave her medications
to relieve the strain on her heart.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.976
I gave her medications that we call
diuretics, water pills,

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.976
to get her to pee out the access fluid.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.620
And over the course
of the next hour and a half or two,

00:05:10.644 --> 00:05:11.976
she started to feel better.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.976
And I felt really good.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.976
And that's when I made my first mistake;

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:19.976
I sent her home.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.976
Actually, I made two more mistakes.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:24.976
I sent her home

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:26.976
without speaking to my attending.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.976
I didn't pick up the phone and do
what I was supposed to do,

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.477
which was call my attending
and run the story by him

00:05:32.501 --> 00:05:34.976
so he would have a chance
to see her for himself.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:36.976
And he knew her,

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.239
he would have been able to furnish
additional information about her.

00:05:40.263 --> 00:05:41.976
Maybe I did it for a good reason.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.976
Maybe I didn't want to be
a high-maintenance resident.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:46.976
Maybe I wanted to be so successful

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:48.976
and so able to take responsibility

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:50.976
that I would do so

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:52.976
and I would be able to take
care of my attending's patients

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:54.976
without even having to contact him.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.976
The second mistake that I made was worse.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:00.976
In sending her home,

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.143
I disregarded a little voice
deep down inside

00:06:03.167 --> 00:06:04.976
that was trying to tell me,

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.976
"Goldman, not a good idea. Don't do this."

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.976
In fact, so lacking in confidence was I

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:12.976
that I actually asked the nurse

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:14.976
who was looking after Mrs. Drucker,

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.976
"Do you think it's okay if she goes home?"

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:19.976
And the nurse thought about it

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:21.976
and said very matter-of-factly,
"Yeah, I think she'll do okay."

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.976
I can remember that like it was yesterday.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:26.976
So I signed the discharge papers,

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.976
and an ambulance came, paramedics
came to take her home.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.976
And I went back to my work on the wards.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:34.976
All the rest of that day,

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:36.976
that afternoon,

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.976
I had this kind of gnawing
feeling inside my stomach.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.976
But I carried on with my work.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:44.976
And at the end of the day,
I packed up to leave the hospital

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:46.976
and walked to the parking lot

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:48.976
to take my car and drive home

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:52.976
when I did something
that I don't usually do.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.976
I walked through the emergency
department on my way home.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:57.976
And it was there that another nurse,

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:01.572
not the nurse who was looking
after Mrs. Drucker before, but another nurse,

00:07:01.596 --> 00:07:03.976
said three words to me

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:05.976
that are the three words

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.976
that most emergency
physicians I know dread.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:10.976
Others in medicine dread them as well,

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.715
but there's something particular
about emergency medicine

00:07:13.739 --> 00:07:16.976
because we see patients so fleetingly.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:18.976
The three words are:

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:22.976
Do you remember?

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.976
"Do you remember
that patient you sent home?"

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:27.976
the other nurse asked matter-of-factly.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:29.976
"Well she's back,"

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:31.976
in just that tone of voice.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:33.976
Well she was back all right.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.976
She was back and near death.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:38.976
About an hour after she had arrived home,

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:40.976
after I'd sent her home,

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.976
she collapsed and her family called 911

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:45.976
and the paramedics brought her
back to the emergency department

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:47.976
where she had a blood pressure of 50,

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:49.976
which is in severe shock.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.976
And she was barely breathing
and she was blue.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.976
And the emerg. staff
pulled out all the stops.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.976
They gave her medications
to raise her blood pressure.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:00.976
They put her on a ventilator.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.976
And I was shocked

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:05.976
and shaken to the core.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:07.976
And I went through this roller coaster,

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:09.976
because after they stabilized her,

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:11.976
she went to the intensive care unit,

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:13.976
and I hoped against hope
that she would recover.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:15.976
And over the next two or three days,

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.334
it was clear that she was never
going to wake up.

00:08:18.358 --> 00:08:20.976
She had irreversible brain damage.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:22.976
And the family gathered.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.976
And over the course
of the next eight or nine days,

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.239
they resigned themselves
to what was happening.

00:08:28.263 --> 00:08:30.976
And at about the nine day
mark, they let her go --

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:32.976
Mrs. Drucker,

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:34.976
a wife, a mother

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.976
and a grandmother.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:39.976
They say you never forget the names

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:41.976
of those who die.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.976
And that was my first time
to be acquainted with that.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:46.976
Over the next few weeks,

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.976
I beat myself up

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:51.976
and I experienced for the first time

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:53.976
the unhealthy shame that exists

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:55.976
in our culture of medicine --

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.976
where I felt alone, isolated,

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:00.976
not feeling the healthy kind
of shame that you feel,

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.524
because you can't talk
about it with your colleagues.

00:09:03.548 --> 00:09:04.976
You know that healthy kind,

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:08.620
when you betray a secret that a best
friend made you promise never to reveal

00:09:08.644 --> 00:09:09.976
and then you get busted

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:11.976
and then your best friend confronts you

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:13.976
and you have terrible discussions,

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.976
but at the end of it
all that sick feeling guides you

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.286
and you say, I'll never
make that mistake again.

00:09:19.310 --> 00:09:22.286
And you make amends and you
never make that mistake again.

00:09:22.310 --> 00:09:24.976
That's the kind of shame
that is a teacher.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:26.976
The unhealthy shame I'm talking about

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.976
is the one that makes you so sick inside.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:31.976
It's the one that says,

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:33.976
not that what you did was bad,

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:35.976
but that you are bad.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.976
And it was what I was feeling.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.976
And it wasn't because of my attending;
he was a doll.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.429
He talked to the family, and I'm quite
sure that he smoothed things over

00:09:45.453 --> 00:09:47.976
and made sure that I didn't get sued.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.976
And I kept asking myself these questions.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.976
Why didn't I ask my attending?
Why did I send her home?

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:55.976
And then at my worst moments:

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.976
Why did I make such a stupid mistake?

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:00.976
Why did I go into medicine?

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:02.976
Slowly but surely,

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:04.976
it lifted.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:06.976
I began to feel a bit better.

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:08.976
And on a cloudy day,

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.953
there was a crack in the clouds
and the sun started to come out

00:10:11.977 --> 00:10:12.976
and I wondered,

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:14.976
maybe I could feel better again.

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:17.976
And I made myself a bargain

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:22.976
that if only I redouble
my efforts to be perfect

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:24.976
and never make another mistake again,

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:26.976
please make the voices stop.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:28.976
And they did.

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:30.976
And I went back to work.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:33.976
And then it happened again.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.976
Two years later I was an attending
in the emergency department

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.191
at a community hospital
just north of Toronto,

00:10:39.215 --> 00:10:41.976
and I saw a 25 year-old
man with a sore throat.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:43.976
It was busy, I was in a bit of a hurry.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:45.976
He kept pointing here.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.334
I looked at his throat,
it was a little bit pink.

00:10:48.358 --> 00:10:50.454
And I gave him a prescription
for penicillin

00:10:50.478 --> 00:10:51.976
and sent him on his way.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:53.976
And even as he was walking out the door,

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.976
he was still sort
of pointing to his throat.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.976
And two days later I came to do
my next emergency shift,

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:03.239
and that's when my chief asked
to speak to me quietly in her office.

00:11:03.263 --> 00:11:06.976
And she said the three words:

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.976
Do you remember?

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.976
"Do you remember that patient
you saw with the sore throat?"

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.334
Well it turns out, he didn't
have a strep throat.

00:11:15.358 --> 00:11:17.597
He had a potentially
life-threatening condition

00:11:17.621 --> 00:11:18.976
called epiglottitis.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:20.976
You can Google it,

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:24.143
but it's an infection, not
of the throat, but of the upper airway,

00:11:24.167 --> 00:11:26.976
and it can actually cause
the airway to close.

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.976
And fortunately he didn't die.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.976
He was placed on intravenous antibiotics

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:34.976
and he recovered after a few days.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:38.976
And I went through the same period
of shame and recriminations

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:42.976
and felt cleansed and went back to work,

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:47.976
until it happened again
and again and again.

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.976
Twice in one emergency shift,
I missed appendicitis.

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.976
Now that takes some doing,

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:55.976
especially when you work in a hospital

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.976
that at the time saw
but 14 people a night.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.976
Now in both cases, I didn't send them home

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.334
and I don't think there
was any gap in their care.

00:12:04.358 --> 00:12:05.976
One I thought had a kidney stone.

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:07.976
I ordered a kidney X-ray. When
it turned out to be normal,

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.976
my colleague who was doing
a reassessment of the patient

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.976
noticed some tenderness in the right
lower quadrant and called the surgeons.

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:15.976
The other one had a lot of diarrhea.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.976
I ordered some fluids to rehydrate him

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:21.976
and asked my colleague to reassess him.

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:23.976
And he did

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:25.976
and when he noticed some tenderness in the right
lower quadrant, called the surgeons.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:27.976
In both cases,

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.976
they had their operations
and they did okay.

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:32.976
But each time,

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:34.976
they were gnawing at me, eating at me.

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:36.976
And I'd like to be able to say to you

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:40.429
that my worst mistakes only happened
in the first five years of practice

00:12:40.453 --> 00:12:42.976
as many of my colleagues
say, which is total B.S.

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:44.976
(Laughter)

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:48.000
Some of my doozies have
been in the last five years.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:52.976
Alone, ashamed and unsupported.

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:54.976
Here's the problem:

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:56.976
If I can't come clean

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:00.976
and talk about my mistakes,

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:02.976
if I can't find the still-small voice

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:04.976
that tells me what really happened,

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:06.976
how can I share it with my colleagues?

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:09.976
How can I teach them about what I did

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:13.976
so that they don't do the same thing?

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:15.976
If I were to walk into a room --

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.976
like right now, I have no
idea what you think of me.

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:20.976
When was the last time
you heard somebody talk

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.000
about failure after failure after failure?

00:13:23.024 --> 00:13:24.976
Oh yeah, you go to a cocktail party

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:27.048
and you might hear
about some other doctor,

00:13:27.072 --> 00:13:28.976
but you're not going to hear somebody

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:30.976
talking about their own mistakes.

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.976
If I were to walk into a room
filled with my colleages

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:35.976
and ask for their support right now

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.429
and start to tell what I've just
told you right now,

00:13:38.453 --> 00:13:40.976
I probably wouldn't get
through two of those stories

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:43.477
before they would start
to get really uncomfortable,

00:13:43.501 --> 00:13:44.976
somebody would crack a joke,

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:48.000
they'd change the subject
and we would move on.

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.976
And in fact, if I knew
and my colleagues knew

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:56.976
that one of my orthopedic colleagues
took off the wrong leg in my hospital,

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:58.976
believe me, I'd have trouble

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:00.976
making eye contact with that person.

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:02.976
That's the system that we have.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:05.976
It's a complete denial of mistakes.

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:07.976
It's a system

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:11.976
in which there are two kinds
of physicians --

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:13.976
those who make mistakes

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:15.976
and those who don't,

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.976
those who can't handle sleep
deprivation and those who can,

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:20.976
those who have lousy outcomes

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:23.976
and those who have great outcomes.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.143
And it's almost
like an ideological reaction,

00:14:26.167 --> 00:14:29.976
like the antibodies begin
to attack that person.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:31.976
And we have this idea

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.143
that if we drive the people
who make mistakes

00:14:34.167 --> 00:14:35.976
out of medicine,

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:39.976
what will we be left
with, but a safe system.

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.976
But there are two problems with that.

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:44.976
In my 20 years or so

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:47.976
of medical broadcasting and journalism,

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:51.239
I've made a personal study of medical
malpractice and medical errors

00:14:51.263 --> 00:14:52.976
to learn everything I can,

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:55.810
from one of the first articles
I wrote for the Toronto Star

00:14:55.834 --> 00:14:57.976
to my show "White Coat, Black Art."

00:14:58.000 --> 00:14:59.976
And what I've learned

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.976
is that errors are absolutely ubiquitous.

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:04.976
We work in a system

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:06.976
where errors happen every day,

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:08.976
where one in 10 medications

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:11.334
are either the wrong
medication given in hospital

00:15:11.358 --> 00:15:12.976
or at the wrong dosage,

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:16.334
where hospital-acquired infections
are getting more and more numerous,

00:15:16.358 --> 00:15:18.976
causing havoc and death.

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:20.976
In this country,

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:22.976
as many as 24,000 Canadians die

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:24.976
of preventable medical errors.

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:28.976
In the United States, the Institute
of Medicine pegged it at 100,000.

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:31.976
In both cases, these
are gross underestimates,

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:34.381
because we really aren't
ferreting out the problem

00:15:34.405 --> 00:15:35.976
as we should.

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:38.976
And here's the thing.

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:41.976
In a hospital system

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:43.976
where medical knowledge is doubling

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:46.976
every two or three years,
we can't keep up with it.

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:49.976
Sleep deprivation is absolutely pervasive.

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:51.976
We can't get rid of it.

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:53.976
We have our cognitive biases,

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:57.143
so that I can take a perfect history
on a patient with chest pain.

00:15:57.167 --> 00:15:59.167
Now take the same patient with chest pain,

00:15:59.191 --> 00:16:00.976
make them moist and garrulous

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:02.976
and put a little bit
of alcohol on their breath,

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:05.239
and suddenly my history
is laced with contempt.

00:16:05.263 --> 00:16:06.976
I don't take the same history.

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:08.976
I'm not a robot;

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:10.976
I don't do things the same way each time.

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:12.976
And my patients aren't cars;

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:15.976
they don't tell me their symptoms
in the same way each time.

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:18.976
Given all of that,
mistakes are inevitable.

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:21.976
So if you take the system,
as I was taught,

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:25.976
and weed out all the error-prone
health professionals,

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:29.000
well there won't be anybody left.

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:32.976
And you know that business

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:34.976
about people not wanting

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:37.976
to talk about their worst cases?

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:39.976
On my show, on "White Coat, Black Art,"

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:42.620
I made it a habit of saying,
"Here's my worst mistake,"

00:16:42.644 --> 00:16:43.976
I would say to everybody

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:46.976
from paramedics to the chief
of cardiac surgery,

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:48.976
"Here's my worst mistake,"
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:52.143
"What about yours?" and I would point
the microphone towards them.

00:16:52.167 --> 00:16:53.976
And their pupils would dilate,

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:55.976
they would recoil,

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:58.976
then they would look down and swallow hard

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:01.976
and start to tell me their stories.

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:05.143
They want to tell their stories.
They want to share their stories.

00:17:05.166 --> 00:17:06.976
They want to be able to say,

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:09.000
"Look, don't make the same mistake I did."

00:17:09.023 --> 00:17:11.644
What they need is an environment
to be able to do that.

00:17:11.667 --> 00:17:14.976
What they need is a redefined
medical culture.

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:17.976
And it starts
with one physician at a time.

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:20.976
The redefined physician is human,

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:22.976
knows she's human,

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:25.048
accepts it, isn't proud
of making mistakes,

00:17:25.071 --> 00:17:26.976
but strives to learn one thing

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:28.976
from what happened

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:30.976
that she can teach to somebody else.

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:32.976
She shares her experience with others.

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:35.976
She's supportive when other
people talk about their mistakes.

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:38.048
And she points out other
people's mistakes,

00:17:38.072 --> 00:17:39.976
not in a gotcha way,

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:42.976
but in a loving, supportive way

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:44.976
so that everybody can benefit.

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:46.976
And she works in a culture of medicine

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:48.976
that acknowledges

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:50.976
that human beings run the system,

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:54.810
and when human beings run the system,
they will make mistakes from time to time.

00:17:54.834 --> 00:17:57.976
So the system is evolving

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:01.976
to create backups

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:04.976
that make it easier
to detect those mistakes

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:07.976
that humans inevitably make

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:10.976
and also fosters
in a loving, supportive way

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:13.976
places where everybody who is observing

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:15.976
in the health care system

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:18.976
can actually point out things
that could be potential mistakes

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:20.976
and is rewarded for doing so,

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:23.667
and especially people like me,
when we do make mistakes,

00:18:23.691 --> 00:18:26.976
we're rewarded for coming clean.

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:29.976
My name is Brian Goldman.

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:32.976
I am a redefined physician.

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:34.976
I'm human. I make mistakes.

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:36.976
I'm sorry about that,

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:38.976
but I strive to learn one thing

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:41.976
that I can pass on to other people.

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:44.976
I still don't know what you think of me,

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:46.976
but I can live with that.

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:49.976
And let me close
with three words of my own:

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:53.976
I do remember.

00:18:54.000 --> 00:19:07.000
(Applause)
