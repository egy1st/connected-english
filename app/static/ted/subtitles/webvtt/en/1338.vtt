00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.979
The maxim, "Know thyself"
has been around since the ancient Greeks.

00:00:05.003 --> 00:00:09.204
Some attribute this golden world
knowledge to Plato, others to Pythagoras.

00:00:09.228 --> 00:00:12.404
But the truth is it doesn't really matter
which sage said it first,

00:00:12.428 --> 00:00:15.215
because it's still
sage advice, even today.

00:00:16.771 --> 00:00:18.231
"Know thyself."

00:00:18.255 --> 00:00:22.185
It's pithy almost to the point
of being meaningless,

00:00:22.209 --> 00:00:24.744
but it rings familiar
and true, doesn't it?

00:00:25.895 --> 00:00:27.205
"Know thyself."

00:00:28.834 --> 00:00:32.149
I understand this timeless dictum
as a statement about the problems,

00:00:32.173 --> 00:00:34.975
or more exactly, the confusions,
of consciousness.

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:37.812
I've always been fascinated
with knowing the self.

00:00:37.836 --> 00:00:40.343
This fascination led me
to submerge myself in art,

00:00:40.367 --> 00:00:43.824
study neuroscience,
and later, to become a psychotherapist.

00:00:43.848 --> 00:00:47.524
Today I combine all my passions
as the CEO of InteraXon,

00:00:47.548 --> 00:00:49.593
a thought-controlled computing company.

00:00:49.964 --> 00:00:54.975
My goal, quite simply, is to help people
become more in tune with themselves.

00:00:55.306 --> 00:00:58.402
I take it from this
little dictum, "Know thyself."

00:00:59.124 --> 00:01:00.607
If you think about it,

00:01:00.631 --> 00:01:05.175
this imperative is kind of the defining
characteristic of our species, isn't it?

00:01:05.858 --> 00:01:07.500
I mean, it's self-awareness

00:01:07.524 --> 00:01:11.140
that separates Homo sapiens
from earlier instances of our mankind.

00:01:12.666 --> 00:01:14.728
Today we're often too busy

00:01:14.752 --> 00:01:19.533
tending to our iPhones and iPods
to really stop and get to know ourselves.

00:01:19.937 --> 00:01:22.564
Under the deluge of minute-to-minute
text conversations,

00:01:22.588 --> 00:01:25.648
e-mails, relentless exchange
of media channels

00:01:25.672 --> 00:01:28.473
and passwords and apps
and reminders and Tweets and tags,

00:01:28.497 --> 00:01:32.223
we lose sight of what all this fuss is
supposed to be about in the first place:

00:01:32.247 --> 00:01:33.862
Ourselves.

00:01:33.886 --> 00:01:35.938
Much of the time we're transfixed

00:01:35.962 --> 00:01:39.254
by all of the ways we can reflect
ourselves out into the world.

00:01:39.278 --> 00:01:44.459
And we can barely find the time to reflect
deeply back in on our own selves.

00:01:45.556 --> 00:01:48.115
We've cluttered ourselves up
with all this.

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:51.570
And we feel like we have to get
far, far away to a secluded retreat,

00:01:51.594 --> 00:01:53.044
leaving it all behind.

00:01:53.068 --> 00:01:56.176
So we go far away
to the top of a mountain,

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:58.230
assuming that perching
ourselves on a piece

00:01:58.254 --> 00:02:02.743
is bound to give us the respite we need
to sort the clutter, the chaotic everyday,

00:02:02.767 --> 00:02:04.441
and find ourselves again.

00:02:05.146 --> 00:02:09.623
But on that mountain where we gain
that beautiful peace of mind,

00:02:10.139 --> 00:02:11.704
what are we really achieving?

00:02:12.284 --> 00:02:15.412
It's really only a successful escape.

00:02:16.468 --> 00:02:18.288
Think of the term we use, "Retreat."

00:02:18.312 --> 00:02:21.133
This is the term that armies use
when they've lost a battle.

00:02:21.157 --> 00:02:22.986
It means we've got to get out of here.

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:25.505
Is this how we feel
about the pressures of our world,

00:02:25.529 --> 00:02:27.523
that in order to get inside ourselves,

00:02:27.547 --> 00:02:28.976
you have to run for the hills?

00:02:29.615 --> 00:02:32.831
And the problem with escaping
your day-to-day life

00:02:32.855 --> 00:02:35.270
is that you have to come home, eventually.

00:02:36.491 --> 00:02:37.904
So when you think about it,

00:02:37.928 --> 00:02:42.382
we're almost like a tourist
visiting ourselves over there.

00:02:42.406 --> 00:02:44.975
And eventually, that vacation's got
to come to an end.

00:02:45.575 --> 00:02:48.324
So my question to you is,

00:02:48.348 --> 00:02:52.427
can we find ways to know ourselves
without the escape?

00:02:53.181 --> 00:02:56.742
Can we redefine our relationship
with the technologized world

00:02:56.766 --> 00:03:00.414
in order to have the heightened
sense of self-awareness that we seek?

00:03:00.438 --> 00:03:03.914
Can we live here and now in our wired web

00:03:03.938 --> 00:03:08.460
and still follow those ancient
instructions, "Know thyself?"

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:11.666
I say the answer is yes.

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:13.736
And I'm here today to share a new way

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:16.170
that we're working
with technology to this end,

00:03:16.194 --> 00:03:19.649
to get familiar with our inner self
like never before --

00:03:19.673 --> 00:03:24.166
humanizing technology
and furthering that age-old quest of ours

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:25.728
to more fully know the self.

00:03:26.683 --> 00:03:30.000
It's called thought-controlled computing.

00:03:32.841 --> 00:03:34.348
You may or may not have noticed

00:03:34.372 --> 00:03:36.681
that I'm wearing a tiny
electrode on my forehead.

00:03:36.705 --> 00:03:38.376
This is actually a brainwave sensor

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:40.756
that's reading the electrical
activity of my brain

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:41.976
as I give this talk.

00:03:42.471 --> 00:03:45.981
These brainwaves are being analyzed
and we can see them as a graph.

00:03:46.005 --> 00:03:47.976
Let me show you what it looks like.

00:03:48.867 --> 00:03:51.478
That blue line there is my brainwave.

00:03:51.502 --> 00:03:55.637
It's the direct signal being recorded
from my head, rendered in real time.

00:03:55.661 --> 00:03:59.072
The green and red bars show
that same signal displayed by frequency,

00:03:59.096 --> 00:04:00.810
with lower frequencies here

00:04:00.834 --> 00:04:02.537
and higher frequencies up here.

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:06.149
You're actually looking
inside my head as I speak.

00:04:07.705 --> 00:04:10.705
These graphs are compelling,
they're undulating,

00:04:10.729 --> 00:04:13.975
but from a human's perspective,
they're actually not very useful.

00:04:14.809 --> 00:04:16.786
That's why we've spent a lot of time

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:20.587
thinking about how to make this data
meaningful to the people who use it.

00:04:20.611 --> 00:04:22.125
For instance,

00:04:22.149 --> 00:04:26.104
what if I could use this data to find out
how relaxed I am at any moment?

00:04:26.128 --> 00:04:27.949
Or what if I can take that information

00:04:27.973 --> 00:04:30.955
and put it into an organic
shape up on the screen?

00:04:31.661 --> 00:04:33.513
The shape on the right over here

00:04:33.537 --> 00:04:36.214
has become an indicator
of what's going on in my head.

00:04:36.238 --> 00:04:37.732
The more relaxed I am,

00:04:37.756 --> 00:04:40.218
the more the energy's going
to fall through it.

00:04:40.242 --> 00:04:43.096
I may also be interested in knowing
how focused I am,

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:46.878
so I can put my level of attention
into the circuit board on the other side.

00:04:46.902 --> 00:04:48.517
And the more focused my brain is,

00:04:48.541 --> 00:04:51.422
the more the circuit board
is going to surge with energy.

00:04:51.446 --> 00:04:54.870
Ordinarily, I would have no way
of knowing how focused or relaxed I was

00:04:54.894 --> 00:04:56.633
in any tangible way.

00:04:57.596 --> 00:04:59.855
As we know, our feelings
about how we're feeling

00:04:59.879 --> 00:05:01.708
are notoriously unreliable.

00:05:01.732 --> 00:05:04.565
We've all had stress creep up
on us without even noticing it

00:05:04.589 --> 00:05:07.005
until we lost it on someone
who didn't deserve it,

00:05:07.029 --> 00:05:10.603
and then we realize that we probably
should have checked in with ourselves

00:05:10.627 --> 00:05:11.780
a little earlier.

00:05:11.804 --> 00:05:14.922
This new awareness
opens up vast possibilities

00:05:14.946 --> 00:05:17.976
for applications that help
improve our lives and ourselves.

00:05:19.199 --> 00:05:21.884
We're trying to create technology
that uses the insights

00:05:21.908 --> 00:05:24.591
to make our work more efficient,
our breaks more relaxing

00:05:24.615 --> 00:05:27.615
and our connections deeper
and more fulfilling than ever.

00:05:28.591 --> 00:05:31.364
I'm going to share some of these
visions with you in a bit,

00:05:31.388 --> 00:05:33.976
but first I want to take
a look at how we got here.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.976
By the way, feel free to check
in on my head at any time.

00:05:37.468 --> 00:05:39.445
(Laughter)

00:05:39.469 --> 00:05:40.976
My team at InteraXon and I

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.789
have been developing thought-controlled
application for almost a decade now.

00:05:44.813 --> 00:05:46.433
In the first phase of development,

00:05:46.457 --> 00:05:49.893
we were really enthused by all the things
we could control with our mind.

00:05:49.917 --> 00:05:54.191
We were making things activate,
light up and work just by thinking.

00:05:54.739 --> 00:05:58.355
We were transcending the space
between the mind and the device.

00:05:58.998 --> 00:06:01.749
We brought to life a vast array
of prototypes and products

00:06:01.773 --> 00:06:03.794
that you could control with your mind,

00:06:03.818 --> 00:06:05.734
like thought-controlled home appliances

00:06:05.758 --> 00:06:09.474
or slot-car games or video games
or a levitating chair.

00:06:10.244 --> 00:06:13.873
We created technology and applications
that engaged people's imaginations,

00:06:13.897 --> 00:06:15.358
and it was really exciting.

00:06:15.382 --> 00:06:19.214
And then we were asked to do something
really big for the Olympics.

00:06:19.839 --> 00:06:22.102
We were invited to create
a massive installation

00:06:22.126 --> 00:06:23.964
at the Vancouver 2010 winter Olympics,

00:06:23.988 --> 00:06:25.519
were used in Vancouver,

00:06:25.543 --> 00:06:28.260
got to control the lighting
on the CN Tower,

00:06:28.284 --> 00:06:31.199
the Canadian Parliament
buildings and Niagara Falls

00:06:31.223 --> 00:06:34.975
from all the way across the country
using their minds.

00:06:35.304 --> 00:06:38.523
Over 17 days at the Olympics,
7,000 visitors from all over the world

00:06:38.547 --> 00:06:40.712
actually got to individually
control the light

00:06:40.736 --> 00:06:43.367
from the CN Tower, parliament
and Niagara in real time

00:06:43.391 --> 00:06:46.412
with their minds from across
the country, 3,000 km away.

00:06:46.436 --> 00:06:49.975
So controlling stuff
with your mind is pretty cool.

00:06:50.810 --> 00:06:54.272
But we're always interested in multitiered
levels of human interaction.

00:06:54.296 --> 00:06:57.697
And so we began looking into inventing
thought-controlled applications

00:06:57.721 --> 00:06:59.992
in a more complex frame than just control.

00:07:00.482 --> 00:07:02.976
And that was responsiveness.

00:07:03.741 --> 00:07:05.312
We realized that we had a system

00:07:05.336 --> 00:07:07.942
that allowed technology
to know something about you.

00:07:07.966 --> 00:07:10.601
And it could join
into the relationship with you.

00:07:11.325 --> 00:07:13.449
We created the responsive room

00:07:13.473 --> 00:07:16.465
where the lights, music and blinds
adjusted to your state.

00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:19.843
They followed these little shifts
in your mental activity.

00:07:19.867 --> 00:07:22.661
So as you settled into relaxation
at the end of a hard day,

00:07:22.685 --> 00:07:24.016
on the couch in our office,

00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:26.196
the music would mellow with you.

00:07:26.220 --> 00:07:28.826
When you read, the desk lamp
would get brighter.

00:07:28.850 --> 00:07:33.365
If you nod off, the system would know,
dimming to darkness as you do.

00:07:34.625 --> 00:07:38.300
We then realized that if technology
could know something about you

00:07:38.324 --> 00:07:39.530
and use it to help you,

00:07:39.554 --> 00:07:42.374
there's an even more valuable
application than that.

00:07:42.398 --> 00:07:45.469
That you could know
something about yourself.

00:07:46.224 --> 00:07:49.402
We could know sides of ourselves
that were all but invisible

00:07:49.426 --> 00:07:51.975
and come to see things
that were previously hidden.

00:07:52.833 --> 00:07:55.579
Let me show you an example
of what I'm talking about here.

00:07:55.603 --> 00:07:58.146
Here's an application
that I created for the iPad.

00:07:58.170 --> 00:08:03.409
So the goal of the original game Zen Bound
is to wrap a rope around a wooden form.

00:08:03.433 --> 00:08:04.977
So you use it with your headset.

00:08:05.001 --> 00:08:07.857
The headset connects wirelessly
to an iPad or a smartphone.

00:08:08.198 --> 00:08:12.528
In that headset, you have fabric sensors
on your forehead and above the ear.

00:08:12.552 --> 00:08:14.074
In the original Zen Bound game,

00:08:14.098 --> 00:08:16.976
you play it by scrolling
your fingers over the pad.

00:08:17.484 --> 00:08:19.426
In the game that we created, of course,

00:08:19.450 --> 00:08:23.602
you control the wooden form
that's on the screen there with your mind.

00:08:24.006 --> 00:08:26.225
As you focus on the wooden form,

00:08:26.249 --> 00:08:27.444
it rotates.

00:08:27.468 --> 00:08:30.501
The more you focus,
the faster the rotation.

00:08:30.858 --> 00:08:32.508
This is for real.

00:08:32.532 --> 00:08:33.976
This is not a fake.

00:08:34.598 --> 00:08:36.438
What's really interesting to me though

00:08:36.462 --> 00:08:40.332
is at the end of the game, you get stats
and feedback about how you did.

00:08:40.356 --> 00:08:44.445
You have graphs and charts
that tell you how your brain was doing --

00:08:44.469 --> 00:08:47.521
not just how much rope you used
or what your high score is,

00:08:47.545 --> 00:08:51.393
but what was going on inside of your mind.

00:08:51.798 --> 00:08:53.667
And this is valuable feedback

00:08:53.691 --> 00:08:58.210
that we can use to understand
what's going on inside of ourselves.

00:09:00.034 --> 00:09:03.228
I like to call this "intra-active."

00:09:04.090 --> 00:09:07.291
Normally, we think
about technology as interactive.

00:09:07.791 --> 00:09:10.502
This technology is intra-active.

00:09:11.562 --> 00:09:15.151
It understands what's inside of you

00:09:15.175 --> 00:09:17.540
and builds a sort
of responsive relationship

00:09:17.564 --> 00:09:19.561
between you and your technology

00:09:19.585 --> 00:09:23.540
so that you can use this information
to move you forward.

00:09:23.972 --> 00:09:28.434
So you can use this information
to understand you in a responsive loop.

00:09:28.894 --> 00:09:30.647
At InteraXon --

00:09:32.412 --> 00:09:37.986
intra-active technology
is one of our really defining mandates.

00:09:38.668 --> 00:09:43.568
It's how we understand the world inside
and reflect it outside

00:09:43.592 --> 00:09:45.635
into this tight loop.

00:09:46.665 --> 00:09:49.794
For example, thought-controlled computing

00:09:49.818 --> 00:09:52.975
can teach children with ADD
how to improve their focus.

00:09:53.426 --> 00:09:57.741
With ADD, children have a low proportion
of beta waves for focus states

00:09:57.765 --> 00:09:59.798
and a high proportion of theta states.

00:09:59.822 --> 00:10:03.008
So you can create applications
that reward focused brain states.

00:10:03.032 --> 00:10:06.237
So you can imagine kids playing
video games with their brain waves

00:10:06.261 --> 00:10:08.730
and improving their ADD
symptoms as they do it.

00:10:08.754 --> 00:10:10.648
This can be as effective as Ritalin.

00:10:11.585 --> 00:10:13.426
Perhaps even more importantly,

00:10:13.450 --> 00:10:16.027
thought-controlled computing
can give children with ADD

00:10:16.051 --> 00:10:18.954
insights into their own fluctuating
mental states,

00:10:18.978 --> 00:10:22.610
so they can better understand themselves
and their learning needs.

00:10:22.634 --> 00:10:26.610
The way these children will be able to use
their new awareness to improve themselves

00:10:26.634 --> 00:10:29.558
will upend many of the damaging
and widespread social stigmas

00:10:29.582 --> 00:10:33.422
that people who are diagnosed
as different are challenged with.

00:10:33.914 --> 00:10:35.270
We can peer inside our heads

00:10:35.294 --> 00:10:38.077
and interact with what was once
locked away from us,

00:10:38.101 --> 00:10:40.999
what once mystified and separated us.

00:10:42.342 --> 00:10:45.632
Brainwave technology can understand us,
anticipate our emotions

00:10:45.656 --> 00:10:47.669
and find the best solutions for our needs.

00:10:47.693 --> 00:10:50.439
Imagine this collected
awareness of the individual

00:10:50.463 --> 00:10:52.975
computed and reflected
across an entire lifespan.

00:10:53.458 --> 00:10:56.975
Imagine the insights that you can gain
from this kind of second sight.

00:10:57.481 --> 00:11:00.426
It would be like plugging
into your own personal Google.

00:11:00.796 --> 00:11:02.046
On the subject of Google,

00:11:02.070 --> 00:11:03.976
today you can search and tag images

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:07.372
based on the thoughts and feelings
you had while you watched them.

00:11:07.396 --> 00:11:10.140
You can tag pictures
of baby animals as happy,

00:11:10.164 --> 00:11:12.634
or whatever baby animals are to you,

00:11:12.658 --> 00:11:16.478
and then you can search that database,
navigating with your feelings,

00:11:16.502 --> 00:11:18.976
rather than the keywords
that just hint at them.

00:11:19.569 --> 00:11:21.828
Or you could tag Facebook photos

00:11:21.852 --> 00:11:26.444
with the emotions that you had
associated with those memories

00:11:26.468 --> 00:11:30.170
and then instantly prioritize
the streams that catch your attention,

00:11:30.894 --> 00:11:32.123
just like this.

00:11:33.447 --> 00:11:36.533
Humanizing technology
is about taking what's already natural

00:11:36.557 --> 00:11:38.157
about the human-tech experience

00:11:38.181 --> 00:11:41.567
and building technology
seamlessly in tandem with it.

00:11:41.591 --> 00:11:43.900
As it aligns with our human behaviors,

00:11:43.924 --> 00:11:47.100
it can allow us to make
better sense of what we do

00:11:47.124 --> 00:11:49.359
and, more importantly, why.

00:11:49.866 --> 00:11:52.976
Creating a big picture
out of all the important little details

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:54.250
that make up who we are.

00:11:55.914 --> 00:11:59.462
With humanized technology we can monitor
the quality of your sleep cycles.

00:12:00.003 --> 00:12:04.255
When our productivity starts to slacken,
we can go back to that data

00:12:04.279 --> 00:12:08.227
and see how we can make more effective
balance between work and play.

00:12:08.932 --> 00:12:12.865
Do you know what causes fatigue in you
or what brings out your energetic self,

00:12:12.889 --> 00:12:14.807
what triggers cause you to be depressed

00:12:14.831 --> 00:12:18.349
or what fun things are going
to bring you out of that funk?

00:12:19.757 --> 00:12:21.403
Imagine if you had access to data

00:12:21.427 --> 00:12:24.624
that allowed you to rank
on a scale of overall happiness

00:12:24.648 --> 00:12:27.504
which people in your life
made you the happiest,

00:12:28.227 --> 00:12:30.623
or what activities brought you joy.

00:12:30.647 --> 00:12:33.702
Would you make more time for those people?
Would you prioritize?

00:12:33.726 --> 00:12:35.001
Would you get a divorce?

00:12:35.025 --> 00:12:36.410
(Laughter)

00:12:36.434 --> 00:12:38.923
What thought-controlled computing
can allow you to do

00:12:38.947 --> 00:12:41.739
is build colorful layered
pictures of our lives.

00:12:41.763 --> 00:12:45.249
And with this, we can get the skinny
on our psychological happenings

00:12:45.273 --> 00:12:47.681
and build a story
of our behaviors over time.

00:12:48.119 --> 00:12:51.338
We can begin to see the underlying
narratives that propel us forward

00:12:51.362 --> 00:12:53.951
and tell us about what's going on.

00:12:54.773 --> 00:12:59.301
And from this, we can learn
how to change the plot, the outcome

00:12:59.325 --> 00:13:02.311
and the character of our personal stories.

00:13:03.566 --> 00:13:07.707
Two millennia ago, those Greeks
had some powerful insights.

00:13:08.422 --> 00:13:10.842
They knew that a fundamental
piece falls into place

00:13:10.866 --> 00:13:13.605
when you start to live
out their little phrase,

00:13:13.629 --> 00:13:15.976
when you come into contact with yourself.

00:13:16.421 --> 00:13:19.772
They understood the power
of human narrative

00:13:19.796 --> 00:13:23.792
and the value that we place on humans
as changing, evolving and growing.

00:13:24.348 --> 00:13:26.976
But they understood something
more fundamental --

00:13:27.825 --> 00:13:29.976
the sheer joy in discovery,

00:13:31.106 --> 00:13:33.635
the delight and fascination
that we get from the world

00:13:33.659 --> 00:13:35.235
and being ourselves in it;

00:13:35.858 --> 00:13:40.651
the richness that we get from seeing,
feeling and knowing the lives that we are.

00:13:41.527 --> 00:13:42.694
My mom's an artist,

00:13:42.718 --> 00:13:46.576
and as a child, I'd often see her bring
things to life with the stroke of a brush.

00:13:46.600 --> 00:13:49.208
One moment, it was
all white space, pure possibility.

00:13:49.232 --> 00:13:52.728
The next, it was alive
with her colorful ideas and expressions.

00:13:53.457 --> 00:13:58.302
As I sat easel-side, watching her
transform canvas after canvas,

00:13:59.153 --> 00:14:01.718
I learned that you could
create your own world.

00:14:02.833 --> 00:14:05.037
I learned that our own inner worlds --

00:14:05.061 --> 00:14:08.201
our ideas, emotions and imaginations --

00:14:08.225 --> 00:14:10.976
were, in fact, not bound
by our brains and bodies.

00:14:11.508 --> 00:14:14.851
If you could think it,
if you could discover it,

00:14:14.875 --> 00:14:16.588
you could bring it to life.

00:14:17.837 --> 00:14:19.976
To me, thought-controlled computing

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:22.403
is as simple and powerful
as a paintbrush --

00:14:22.427 --> 00:14:25.975
one more tool to unlock and enliven
the hidden worlds within us.

00:14:26.963 --> 00:14:31.232
I look forward to the day
that I can sit beside you, easel-side,

00:14:31.790 --> 00:14:35.905
watching the world that we can create
with our new toolboxes

00:14:35.929 --> 00:14:38.975
and the discoveries
that we can make about ourselves.

00:14:40.492 --> 00:14:41.699
Thank you.

00:14:41.723 --> 00:14:43.523
(Applause)
