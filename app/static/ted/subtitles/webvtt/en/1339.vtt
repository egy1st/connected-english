WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
We do not invest in victims,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
we invest in survivors.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
And in ways both big and small,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
the narrative of the victim

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
shapes the way we see women.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
You can't count what you don't see.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
And we don't invest in what's invisible to us.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
But this is the face

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
of resilience.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Six years ago,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
I started writing about women entrepreneurs

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
during and after conflict.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
I set out to write a compelling economic story,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
one that had great characters, that no one else was telling,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
and one that I thought mattered.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
And that turned out to be women.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
I had left ABC news and a career I loved at the age of 30

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
for business school,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
a path I knew almost nothing about.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
None of the women I had grown up with in Maryland

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
had graduated from college,

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
let alone considered business school.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
But they had hustled to feed their kids

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
and pay their rent.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
And I saw from a young age

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
that having a decent job and earning a good living

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
made the biggest difference

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
for families who were struggling.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
So if you're going to talk about jobs,

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
then you have to talk about entrepreneurs.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
And if you're talking about entrepreneurs

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
in conflict and post-conflict settings,

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
then you must talk about women,

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
because they are the population you have left.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.000
Rwanda in the immediate aftermath of the genocide

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
was 77 percent female.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
I want to introduce you

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
to some of those entrepreneurs I've met

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
and share with you some of what they've taught me over the years.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
I went to Afghanistan in 2005

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
to work on a Financial Times piece,

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
and there I met Kamila,

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
a young women who told me she had just turned down

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
a job with the international community

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
that would have paid her nearly $2,000 a month --

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
an astronomical sum in that context.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
And she had turned it down, she said,

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
because she was going to start her next business,

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
an entrepreneurship consultancy

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
that would teach business skills

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
to men and women all around Afghanistan.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
Business, she said,

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
was critical to her country's future.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000
Because long after this round of internationals left,

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
business would help keep her country

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
peaceful and secure.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000
And she said business was even more important for women

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000
because earning an income earned respect

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000
and money was power for women.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
So I was amazed.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
I mean here was a girl who had never lived in peace time

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
who somehow had come to sound like a candidate from "The Apprentice."

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
(Laughter)

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000
So I asked her, "How in the world do you know this much about business?

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
Why are you so passionate?"

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.000
She said, "Oh Gayle, this is actually my third business.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
My first business was a dressmaking business

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
I started under the Taliban.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
And that was actually an excellent business,

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000
because we provided jobs for women all around our neighborhood.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000
And that's really how I became an entrepreneur."

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
Think about this:

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
Here were girls who braved danger

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
to become breadwinners

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000
during years in which they couldn't even be on their streets.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000
And at a time of economic collapse

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
when people sold baby dolls and shoe laces

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000
and windows and doors

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000
just to survive,

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
these girls made the difference

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
between survival and starvation

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
for so many.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000
I couldn't leave the story, and I couldn't leave the topic either,

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000
because everywhere I went I met more of these women

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000
who no one seemed to know about,

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
or even wish to.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000
I went on to Bosnia,

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000
and early on in my interviews I met with an IMF official

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000
who said, "You know, Gayle,

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000
I don't think we actually have women in business in Bosnia,

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000
but there is a lady selling cheese nearby

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000
on the side of the road.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000
So maybe you could interview her."

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000
So I went out reporting

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.000
and within a day I met Narcisa Kavazovic

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000
who at that point was opening a new factory

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
on the war's former front lines in Sarajevo.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
She had started her business

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
squatting in an abandoned garage,

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000
sewing sheets and pillow cases

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000
she would take to markets all around the city

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000
so that she could support

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000
the 12 or 13 family members

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000
who were counting on her for survival.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000
By the time we met, she had 20 employees,

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000
most of them women,

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.000
who were sending their boys and their girls to school.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000
And she was just the start.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000
I met women running essential oils businesses,

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000
wineries

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.000
and even the country's largest advertising agency.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000
So these stories together

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000
became the Herald Tribune business cover.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000
And when this story posted,

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000
I ran to my computer to send it to the IMF official.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.000
And I said, "Just in case you're looking for entrepreneurs

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.000
to feature at your next investment conference,

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000
here are a couple of women."

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:50.000
(Applause)

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
But think about this.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.000
The IMF official is hardly the only person

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.000
to automatically file women under micro.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000
The biases, whether intentional or otherwise,

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000
are pervasive,

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.000
and so are the misleading mental images.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000
If you see the word "microfinance,"

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.000
what comes to mind?

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000
Most people say women.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.000
And if you see the word "entrepreneur,"

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000
most people think men.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000
Why is that?

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.000
Because we aim low and we think small

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000
when it comes to women.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000
Microfinance is an incredibly powerful tool

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.000
that leads to self-sufficiency and self-respect,

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000
but we must move beyond micro-hopes

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.000
and micro-ambitions for women,

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.000
because they have so much greater hopes for themselves.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.000
They want to move from micro to medium and beyond.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000
And in many places,

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000
they're there.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000
In the U.S., women-owned businesses

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.000
will create five and a half million new jobs by 2018.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.000
In South Korea and Indonesia,

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.000
women own nearly half a million firms.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000
China, women run 20 percent

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000
of all small businesses.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000
And in the developing world overall,

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000
That figure is 40 to 50 percent.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000
Nearly everywhere I go,

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000
I meet incredibly interesting entrepreneurs

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.000
who are seeking access to finance, access to markets

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000
and established business networks.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000
They are often ignored

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.000
because they're harder to help.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.000
It is much riskier to give a 50,000 dollar loan

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.000
than it is to give a 500 dollar loan.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000
And as the World Bank recently noted,

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.000
women are stuck in a productivity trap.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000
Those in small businesses

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000
can't get the capital they need to expand

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.000
and those in microbusiness

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.000
can't grow out of them.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.000
Recently I was at the State Department in Washington

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.000
and I met an incredibly passionate entrepreneur from Ghana.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.000
She sells chocolates.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.000
And she had come to Washington,

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.000
not seeking a handout and not seeking a microloan.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.000
She had come seeking serious investment dollars

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000
so that she could build the factory

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000
and buy the equipment she needs

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.000
to export her chocolates

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.000
to Africa, Europe, the Middle East

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000
and far beyond --

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.000
capital that would help her to employ

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.000
more than the 20 people

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:08.000
that she already has working for her,

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.000
and capital that would fuel her own country's

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.000
economic climb.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.000
The great news is

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.000
we already know what works.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.000
Theory and empirical evidence

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.000
Have already taught us.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:23.000
We don't need to invent solutions because we have them --

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.000
cash flow loans

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.000
based in income rather than assets,

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.000
loans that use secure contracts rather than collateral,

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.000
because women often don't own land.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.000
And Kiva.org, the microlender,

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.000
is actually now experimenting with crowdsourcing

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.000
small and medium sized loans.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.000
And that's just to start.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:46.000
Recently it has become very much in fashion

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:50.000
to call women "the emerging market of the emerging market."

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000
I think that is terrific.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000
You know why?

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:58.000
Because -- and I say this as somebody who worked in finance --

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:01.000
500 billion dollars at least

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:04.000
has gone into the emerging markets in the past decade.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:07.000
Because investors saw the potential for return

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.000
at a time of slowing economic growth,

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.000
and so they created financial products

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.000
and financial innovation

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:16.000
tailored to the emerging markets.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:19.000
How wonderful would it be

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.000
if we were prepared to replace all of our lofty words

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.000
with our wallets

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.000
and invest 500 billion dollars

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:28.000
unleashing women's economic potential?

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.000
Just think of the benefits

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000
when it comes to jobs, productivity,

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.000
employment, child nutrition,

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.000
maternal mortality, literacy

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:40.000
and much, much more.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:43.000
Because, as the World Economic Forum noted,

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:46.000
smaller gender gaps are directly correlated

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.000
with increased economic competitiveness.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.000
And not one country in all the world

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:54.000
has eliminated its economic participation gap --

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.000
not one.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.000
So the great news

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.000
is this is an incredible opportunity.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.000
We have so much room to grow.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.000
So you see,

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.000
this is not about doing good,

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.000
this is about global growth

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.000
and global employment.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.000
It is about how we invest

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.000
and it's about how we see women.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.000
And women can no longer be

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.000
both half the population

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.000
and a special interest group.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:28.000
(Applause)

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:31.000
Oftentimes I get into very interesting discussions with reporters

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.000
who say to me, "Gayle, these are great stories,

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:36.000
but you're really writing about the exceptions."

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.000
Now that makes me pause for just a couple reasons.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.000
First of all, for exceptions,

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.000
there are a lot of them

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:46.000
and they're important.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:49.000
Secondly, when we talk about men who are succeeding,

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.000
we rightly consider them

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.000
icons or pioneers or innovators

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.000
to be emulated.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.000
And when we talk about women,

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:00.000
they are either exceptions to be dismissed

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.000
or aberrations to be ignored.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.000
And finally,

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:08.000
there is no society anywhere in all the world

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.000
that is not changed

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.000
except by its most exceptional.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:16.000
So why wouldn't we celebrate and elevate

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.000
these change makers and job creators

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:21.000
rather than overlook them?

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:24.000
This topic of resilience is very personal to me

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:27.000
and in many ways has shaped my life.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.000
My mom was a single mom

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:32.000
who worked at the phone company during the day

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.000
and sold Tupperware at night

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:37.000
so that I could have every opportunity possible.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.000
We shopped double coupons

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.000
and layaway and consignment stores,

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:44.000
and when she got sick with stage four breast cancer

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.000
and could no longer work,

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:49.000
we even applied for food stamps.

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.000
And when I would feel sorry for myself

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:53.000
as nine or 10 year-old girls do,

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:56.000
she would say to me, "My dear, on a scale of major world tragedies,

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.000
yours is not a three."

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.000
(Laughter)

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.000
And when I was applying to business school

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:04.000
and felt certain I couldn't do it

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:06.000
and nobody I knew had done it,

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:09.000
I went to my aunt who survived years of beatings at the hand of her husband

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.000
and escaped a marriage of abuse

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.000
with only her dignity intact.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.000
And she told me,

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:18.000
"Never import other people's limitations."

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.000
And when I complained to my grandmother,

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.000
a World War II veteran

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.000
who worked in film for 50 years

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.000
and who supported me from the age of 13,

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.000
that I was terrified

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.000
that if I turned down a plum assignment at ABC

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:33.000
for a fellowship overseas,

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:36.000
I would never ever, ever find another job,

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.000
she said, "Kiddo, I'm going to tell you two things.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:41.000
First of all, no one turns down a Fulbright,

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:44.000
and secondly, McDonald's is always hiring."

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:46.000
(Laughter)

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:49.000
"You will find a job. Take the leap."

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.000
The women in my family

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.000
are not exceptions.

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.000
The women in this room and watching in L.A.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.000
and all around the world

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.000
are not exceptions.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:03.000
We are not a special interest group.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:05.000
We are the majority.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:07.000
And for far too long,

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:09.000
we have underestimated ourselves

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:12.000
and been undervalued by others.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.000
It is time for us to aim higher

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.000
when it comes to women,

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:19.000
to invest more and to deploy our dollars

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:22.000
to benefit women all around the world.

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:24.000
We can make a difference,

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:26.000
and make a difference, not just for women,

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.000
but for a global economy

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:32.000
that desperately needs their contributions.

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.000
Together we can make certain

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.000
that the so-called exceptions

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.000
begin to rule.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:41.000
When we change the way we see ourselves,

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.000
others will follow.

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:45.000
And it is time for all of us

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:47.000
to think bigger.

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:49.000
Thank you very much.

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:54.000
(Applause)
