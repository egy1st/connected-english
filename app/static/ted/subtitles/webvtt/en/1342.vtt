00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:05.376
As the highest military commander
of the Netherlands,

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:08.416
with troops stationed around the world,

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:11.160
I'm really honored to be here today.

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:16.776
When I look around
this TEDxAmsterdam venue,

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.960
I see a very special audience.

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:24.864
You are the reason why I said yes

00:00:24.888 --> 00:00:27.608
to the invitation to come here today.

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:34.480
When I look around, I see people
who want to make a contribution.

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:38.720
I see people who want
to make a better world,

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:43.976
by doing groundbreaking scientific work,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.440
by creating impressive works of art,

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:51.800
by writing critical articles
or inspiring books,

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:55.040
by starting up sustainable businesses.

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:00.736
And you all have chosen
your own instruments

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:04.080
to fulfill this mission
of creating a better world.

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:08.680
Some chose the microscope
as their instrument.

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.020
Others chose dancing or painting,

00:01:12.911 --> 00:01:14.984
or making music like we just heard.

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.160
Some chose the pen.

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:21.560
Others work through
the instrument of money.

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.480
Ladies and gentlemen,
I made a different choice.

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:42.040
Thanks.

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:46.880
Ladies and gentlemen ...

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:51.096
(Laughter)

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:55.640
(Applause)

00:01:57.031 --> 00:01:59.094
I share your goals.

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.640
I share the goals
of the speakers you heard before.

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:10.479
I did not choose to take up the pen,

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:12.760
the brush,

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:14.800
the camera.

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:18.600
I chose this instrument.

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:21.960
I chose the gun.

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:25.496
For you, and you heard already,

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:31.280
being so close to this gun
may make you feel uneasy.

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:34.080
It may even feel scary.

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:38.360
A real gun at a few feet's distance.

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:44.040
Let us stop for a moment
and feel this uneasiness.

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:45.920
You could even hear it.

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:49.536
Let us cherish the fact

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:54.320
that probably most of you
have never been close to a gun.

00:02:55.800 --> 00:03:00.040
It means the Netherlands
is a peaceful country.

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:03.200
The Netherlands is not at war.

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:08.360
It means soldiers are not needed
to patrol our streets.

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:12.960
Guns are not a part of our lives.

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:18.280
In many countries,
it is a different story.

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:23.936
In many countries,
people are confronted with guns.

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:25.816
They are oppressed.

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:27.120
They are intimidated --

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:29.440
by warlords,

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:31.800
by terrorists,

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:33.960
by criminals.

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:36.960
Weapons can do a lot of harm.

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:40.280
They are the cause of much distress.

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:45.120
Why then am I standing before you
with this weapon?

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:50.040
Why did I choose the gun as my instrument?

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:53.400
Today I want to tell you why.

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:55.736
Today I want to tell you

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:58.720
why I chose the gun
to create a better world.

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:03.840
And I want to tell you
how this gun can help.

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:10.040
My story starts in the city of Nijmegen

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:13.120
in the east of the Netherlands,

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:16.360
the city where I was born.

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:22.320
My father was a hardworking baker,

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:27.656
but when he had finished
work in the bakery,

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:30.400
he often told me and my brother stories.

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:33.256
And most of the time,

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:36.480
he told me this story
I'm going to share with you now.

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:39.976
The story of what happened

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.336
when he was a conscripted soldier
in the Dutch armed forces

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:46.760
at the beginning of the Second World War.

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:50.440
The Nazis invaded the Netherlands.

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:52.960
Their grim plans were evident.

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:57.120
They meant to rule by means of repression.

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:01.760
Diplomacy had failed to stop the Germans.

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:05.752
Only brute force remained.

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:08.320
It was our last resort.

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:12.720
My father was there to provide it.

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:17.856
As the son of a farmer
who knew how to hunt,

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:20.120
my father was an excellent marksman.

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:23.560
When he aimed, he never missed.

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:27.816
At this decisive moment in Dutch history

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:32.656
my father was positioned
on the bank of the river Waal

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:34.280
near the city of Nijmegen.

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:40.960
He had a clear shot at the German soldiers
who came to occupy a free country,

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:43.496
his country,

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:44.720
our country.

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:47.960
He fired. Nothing happened.

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:49.906
He fired again.

00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:53.040
No German soldier fell to the ground.

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:58.976
My father had been given an old gun

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.480
that could not even reach
the opposite riverbank.

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:06.976
Hitler's troops marched on,

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.920
and there was nothing
my father could do about it.

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:14.336
Until the day my father died,

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:17.720
he was frustrated
about missing these shots.

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:20.640
He could have done something.

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:23.416
But with an old gun,

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:26.336
not even the best marksman
in the armed forces

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:27.640
could have hit the mark.

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:31.680
So this story stayed with me.

00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:34.576
Then in high school,

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:38.160
I was gripped by the stories
of the Allied soldiers --

00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:44.696
soldiers who left the safety
of their own homes and risked their lives

00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:46.040
to liberate a country

00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:50.200
and a people that they didn't know.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.200
They liberated my birth town.

00:06:54.640 --> 00:06:59.320
It was then that I decided
I would take up the gun --

00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:05.176
out of respect and gratitude
for those men and women

00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:07.560
who came to liberate us.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.800
From the awareness
that sometimes only the gun

00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:17.960
can stand between good and evil.

00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:22.896
And that is why I took up the gun --

00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:24.120
not to shoot,

00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:26.296
not to kill,

00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:27.640
not to destroy,

00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:31.160
but to stop those who would do evil,

00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:34.120
to protect the vulnerable,

00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:37.600
to defend democratic values,

00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:44.240
to stand up for the freedom we have
to talk here today in Amsterdam

00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:47.480
about how we can
make the world a better place.

00:07:49.640 --> 00:07:50.856
Ladies and gentlemen,

00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:55.560
I do not stand here today
to tell you about the glory of weapons.

00:07:57.200 --> 00:07:59.200
I do not like guns.

00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:03.960
And once you have been
under fire yourself,

00:08:05.080 --> 00:08:07.616
it brings home even more clearly

00:08:07.640 --> 00:08:12.120
that a gun is not
some macho instrument to brag about.

00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:15.096
I stand here today

00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:20.480
to tell you about the use of the gun
as an instrument of peace and stability.

00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:27.456
The gun may be one of the most important
instruments of peace and stability

00:08:27.480 --> 00:08:28.960
that we have in this world.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.960
Now this may sound contradictory to you.

00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:38.135
But not only have I seen with my own eyes

00:08:38.159 --> 00:08:41.182
during my deployments in Lebanon, Sarajevo

00:08:41.206 --> 00:08:45.016
and as the Netherlands' Chief of Defence,

00:08:45.040 --> 00:08:50.960
this is also supported
by cold, hard statistics.

00:08:51.960 --> 00:08:56.960
Violence has declined dramatically
over the last 500 years.

00:08:58.040 --> 00:09:01.440
Despite the pictures
we are shown daily in the news,

00:09:02.440 --> 00:09:07.256
wars between developed countries
are no longer commonplace.

00:09:07.280 --> 00:09:08.536
The murder rate in Europe

00:09:08.560 --> 00:09:12.840
has dropped by a factor of 30
since the Middle Ages.

00:09:13.520 --> 00:09:16.296
And occurrences
of civil war and repression

00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:19.120
have declined since the end
of the Cold War.

00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:25.520
Statistics show that we are living
in a relatively peaceful era.

00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:27.630
Why?

00:09:28.040 --> 00:09:30.360
Why has violence decreased?

00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:33.256
Has the human mind changed?

00:09:33.280 --> 00:09:35.927
Well, we were talking
about the human mind this morning.

00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:41.256
Did we simply lose
our beastly impulses for revenge,

00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:43.536
for violent rituals,

00:09:43.560 --> 00:09:44.840
for pure rage?

00:09:46.360 --> 00:09:47.840
Or is there something else?

00:09:49.640 --> 00:09:53.256
In his latest book,
Harvard professor Steven Pinker --

00:09:53.280 --> 00:09:55.656
and many other thinkers before him --

00:09:55.680 --> 00:10:00.496
concludes that one of the main drivers

00:10:00.520 --> 00:10:03.056
behind less violent societies

00:10:03.080 --> 00:10:05.960
is the spread of the constitutional state

00:10:07.080 --> 00:10:10.264
and the introduction, on a large scale,

00:10:10.288 --> 00:10:13.960
of the state monopoly
on the legitimized use of violence --

00:10:15.440 --> 00:10:19.960
legitimized by a democratically
elected government,

00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:26.600
legitimized by checks and balances
and an independent judicial system.

00:10:27.640 --> 00:10:30.696
In other words, a state monopoly

00:10:30.720 --> 00:10:35.200
that has the use of violence
well under control.

00:10:36.400 --> 00:10:42.600
Such a state monopoly on violence,
first of all, serves as a reassurance.

00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:46.976
It removes the incentive for an arms race

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:50.440
between potentially hostile groups
in our societies.

00:10:51.520 --> 00:10:54.296
Secondly, the presence of penalties

00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:57.976
that outweigh the benefits
of using violence

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.120
tips the balance even further.

00:11:01.320 --> 00:11:03.136
Abstaining from violence

00:11:03.160 --> 00:11:06.280
becomes more profitable
than starting a war.

00:11:07.600 --> 00:11:12.200
Now nonviolence starts to work
like a flywheel.

00:11:13.160 --> 00:11:15.400
It enhances peace even further.

00:11:16.840 --> 00:11:19.840
Where there is no conflict,
trade flourishes.

00:11:21.480 --> 00:11:25.440
And trade is another important
incentive against violence.

00:11:26.520 --> 00:11:32.320
With trade, there's mutual interdependency
and mutual gain between parties.

00:11:33.400 --> 00:11:38.456
And when there is mutual gain,
both sides stand to lose more

00:11:38.480 --> 00:11:41.313
than they would gain
if they started a war.

00:11:42.880 --> 00:11:47.336
War is simply no longer the best option,

00:11:47.360 --> 00:11:50.934
and that is why violence has decreased.

00:11:53.080 --> 00:11:54.856
This, ladies and gentlemen,

00:11:54.880 --> 00:11:59.720
is the rationale behind the existence
of my armed forces.

00:12:00.560 --> 00:12:04.960
The armed forces implement
the state monopoly on violence.

00:12:05.640 --> 00:12:08.096
We do this in a legitimized way

00:12:08.120 --> 00:12:13.960
only after our democracy
has asked us to do so.

00:12:15.080 --> 00:12:20.256
It is this legitimate,
controlled use of the gun

00:12:20.280 --> 00:12:22.096
that has contributed greatly

00:12:22.120 --> 00:12:27.680
to reducing the statistics of war,
conflict and violence around the globe.

00:12:28.520 --> 00:12:32.056
It is this participation
in peacekeeping missions

00:12:32.080 --> 00:12:35.960
that has led to the resolution
of many civil wars.

00:12:36.760 --> 00:12:42.040
My soldiers use the gun
as an instrument of peace.

00:12:43.280 --> 00:12:47.400
And this is exactly
why failed states are so dangerous.

00:12:48.640 --> 00:12:53.440
Failed states have no legitimized,
democratically controlled use of force.

00:12:54.240 --> 00:12:59.851
Failed states do not know of the gun
as an instrument of peace and stability.

00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:07.960
That is why failed states can drag down
a whole region into chaos and conflict.

00:13:08.960 --> 00:13:12.856
That is why spreading the concept
of the constitutional state

00:13:12.880 --> 00:13:16.440
is such an important aspect
of our foreign missions.

00:13:17.520 --> 00:13:21.256
That is why we are trying
to build a judicial system

00:13:21.280 --> 00:13:23.320
right now in Afghanistan.

00:13:24.560 --> 00:13:28.816
That is why we train
police officers, we train judges,

00:13:28.840 --> 00:13:31.600
we train public prosecutors
around the world.

00:13:32.600 --> 00:13:33.936
And that is why --

00:13:33.960 --> 00:13:37.256
and in the Netherlands,
we are very unique in that --

00:13:37.280 --> 00:13:41.016
that is why the Dutch constitution states

00:13:41.040 --> 00:13:44.296
that one of the main tasks
of the armed forces

00:13:44.320 --> 00:13:48.520
is to uphold and promote
the international rule of law.

00:13:51.120 --> 00:13:52.696
Ladies and gentlemen,

00:13:52.720 --> 00:13:58.783
looking at this gun, we are confronted
with the ugly side of the human mind.

00:14:00.640 --> 00:14:06.656
Every day I hope that politicians,
diplomats, development workers

00:14:06.680 --> 00:14:10.136
can turn conflict into peace

00:14:10.160 --> 00:14:12.176
and threat

00:14:12.200 --> 00:14:13.422
into hope.

00:14:14.040 --> 00:14:18.816
And I hope that one day
armies can be disbanded

00:14:18.840 --> 00:14:21.736
and humans will find a way
of living together

00:14:21.760 --> 00:14:23.817
without violence and oppression.

00:14:25.200 --> 00:14:27.800
But until that day comes,

00:14:28.880 --> 00:14:34.256
we will have to make ideals
and human failure

00:14:34.280 --> 00:14:35.960
meet somewhere in the middle.

00:14:36.920 --> 00:14:41.936
Until that day comes,
I stand for my father

00:14:41.960 --> 00:14:45.400
who tried to shoot the Nazis
with an old gun.

00:14:46.200 --> 00:14:52.256
I stand for my men and women
who are prepared to risk their lives

00:14:52.280 --> 00:14:55.200
for a less violent world for all of us.

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:02.896
I stand for this soldier
who suffered partial hearing loss

00:15:02.920 --> 00:15:06.056
and sustained permanent
injuries to her leg,

00:15:06.080 --> 00:15:10.230
when she was hit by a rocket
on a mission in Afghanistan.

00:15:12.600 --> 00:15:14.376
Ladies and gentlemen,

00:15:14.400 --> 00:15:19.656
until the day comes
when we can do away with the gun,

00:15:19.680 --> 00:15:22.536
I hope we all agree

00:15:22.560 --> 00:15:26.520
that peace and stability
do not come free of charge.

00:15:27.840 --> 00:15:32.560
It takes hard work,
often behind the scenes.

00:15:33.640 --> 00:15:38.320
It takes good equipment
and well-trained, dedicated soldiers.

00:15:39.280 --> 00:15:44.216
I hope you will support
the efforts of our armed forces

00:15:44.240 --> 00:15:47.256
to train soldiers like this young captain

00:15:47.280 --> 00:15:50.176
and provide her with a good gun,

00:15:50.200 --> 00:15:52.960
instead of the bad gun
my father was given.

00:15:53.800 --> 00:15:58.480
I hope you will support our soldiers
when they are out there,

00:15:59.520 --> 00:16:00.760
when they come home

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:05.000
and when they are injured
and need our care.

00:16:05.840 --> 00:16:10.656
They put their lives on the line,
for us, for you,

00:16:10.680 --> 00:16:13.640
and we cannot let them down.

00:16:14.640 --> 00:16:18.976
I hope you will respect my soldiers,

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:20.960
this soldier with this gun.

00:16:21.920 --> 00:16:24.662
Because she wants a better world.

00:16:25.240 --> 00:16:29.360
Because she makes an active
contribution to a better world,

00:16:30.080 --> 00:16:32.960
just like all of us here today.

00:16:33.880 --> 00:16:35.336
Thank you very much.

00:16:35.360 --> 00:16:40.720
(Applause)
