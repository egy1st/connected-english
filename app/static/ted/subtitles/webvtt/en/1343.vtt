00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Everybody in our society's life is touched by cancer --

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
if not personally,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
then through a loved one, a family member,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
colleague, friend.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
And once our lives are touched by cancer,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
we quickly learn

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
that there are basically

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
three weapons, or three tools, that are available

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
to fight the disease:

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
surgery, radiation and chemotherapy.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
And once we get involved

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
in the therapeutic decisions,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
again either personally

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
or with our loved ones and family members,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
we also very quickly learn

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
the benefits, the trade-offs and the limitations

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
of these tools.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
I'm very thankful to Jay and to Mark

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
and the TEDMED team

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
for inviting me today

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
to describe a fourth tool, a new tool,

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
that we call Tumor Treating Fields.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
Tumor Treating Fields

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
were invented by Dr. Yoram Palti,

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
professor emeritus at the Technion in Israel.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
And they use low-intensity

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
electric fields

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
to fight cancer.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
To understand how Tumor Treating Fields work,

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
we first need to understand

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
what are electric fields.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
Let me first address

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
a few popular misconceptions.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
First of all, electric fields

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
are not an electric current

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
that is coursing through the tissue.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
Electric fields

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
are not ionizing radiation,

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
like X-rays or proton beams,

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
that bombard tissue

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
to disrupt DNA.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
And electric fields

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
are not magnetism.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
What electric fields are

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
are a field of forces.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
And these forces

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
act on, attract, bodies

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
that have an electrical charge.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
The best way to visualize an electric field

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
is to think of gravity.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
Gravity is also a field of forces

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
that act on masses.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
We can all picture astronauts in space.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
They float freely in three dimensions

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
without any forces acting on them.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000
But as that space shuttle

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
returns to Earth,

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000
and as the astronauts enter the Earth's gravitational field,

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000
they begin to see the effects of gravity.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
They begin to be attracted towards Earth.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
And as they land,

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
they're fully aligned in the gravitational field.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000
We're, of course, all stuck in the Earth's gravitational field right now.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000
That's why you're all in your chairs.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
And that's why we have to use our muscle energy

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
to stand up, to walk around

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000
and to lift things.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
In cancer,

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
cells rapidly divide

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
and lead to uncontrolled tumor growth.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
We can think of a cell

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
from an electrical perspective

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000
as if it's a mini space station.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
And in that space station

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000
we have the genetic material, the chromosomes,

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
within a nucleus.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
And out in the cytoplasmic soup

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
we have special proteins

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000
that are required for cell division

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
that float freely in this soup

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
in three dimensions.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000
Importantly, those special proteins

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000
are among the most highly charged objects

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
in our body.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
As cell division begins

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
the nucleus disintegrates,

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
the chromosomes line up

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
in the middle of the cell

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000
and those special proteins

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.000
undergo a three-dimensional sequence

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000
whereby they attach

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.000
and they literally click into place end-on-end

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000
to form chains.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000
These chains

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000
then progress and attach

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.000
to the genetic material

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000
and pull the genetic material

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000
from one cell into two cells.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000
And this is exactly how

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000
one cancer cell becomes two cancer cells,

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
two cancer cells become four cancer cells,

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000
and we have ultimately

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.000
uncontrolled tumor growth.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.000
Tumor Treating Fields

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.000
use externally placed transducers

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.000
attached to a field generator

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:21.000
to create an artificial electric field

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000
on that space station.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000
And when that cellular space station

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000
is within the electric field,

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:33.000
it acts on those highly charged proteins

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000
and aligns them.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.000
And it prevents them from forming those chains,

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000
those mitotic spindles,

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.000
that are necessary to pull the genetic material

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000
into the daughter cells.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000
What we see is that the cells will attempt to divide

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000
for several hours.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.000
And they will either enter into

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000
this so-called cellular suicide,

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000
programmed cell death,

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000
or they will form unhealthy daughter cells

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000
and enter into apoptosis

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000
once they have divided.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000
And we can observe this.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000
What I'm going to show you next

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000
are two in vitro experiments.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.000
This is cultures, identical cultures,

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000
of cervical cancer cells.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000
And we've stained these cultures

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000
with a green florescent dye

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.000
so that we can look at these proteins

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000
that form these chains.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000
The first clip shows

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000
a normal cell division

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000
without the Tumor Treating Fields.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.000
What we see

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000
are, first of all, a very active culture,

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000
a lot of divisions,

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000
and then very clear nuclei

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000
once the cells have separated.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000
And we can see them dividing throughout.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000
When we apply the fields --

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.000
again, in the identical time-scale

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000
to the identical culture --

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000
you're going to see something different.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.000
The cells round up for division,

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.000
but they're very static in that position.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000
We'll see two cells

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:05.000
in the upper part of the screen

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000
attempting to divide.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.000
The one within the circle manages.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.000
But see how much of the protein

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.000
is still throughout the nucleus,

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000
even in the dividing cell.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000
The one up there can't divide at all.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.000
And then this bubbling, this membrane bubbling,

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000
is the hallmark

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.000
of apoptosis in this cell.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:29.000
Formation of healthy mitotic spindles

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.000
is necessary for division

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000
in all cell types.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000
We've applied Tumor Treating Fields

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.000
to over 20 different cancers in the lab,

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.000
and we see this effect

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.000
in all of them.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.000
Now importantly,

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:49.000
these Tumor Treating Fields have no effect

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000
on normal undividing cells.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000
10 years ago,

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.000
Dr. Palti founded a company called Novocure

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.000
to develop his discovery

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.000
into a practical therapy for patients.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:06.000
In that time, Novocure's developed two systems --

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.000
one system for cancers in the head

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.000
and another system for cancers in the trunk of the body.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.000
The first cancer that we have focused on

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.000
is the deadly brain cancer, GBM.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.000
GBM affects about 10,000 people

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.000
in the U.S. each year.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.000
It's a death sentence.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.000
The expected five year survival

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000
is less than five percent.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000
And the typical patient

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.000
with optimal therapy

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:37.000
survives just a little over a year,

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.000
and only about seven months

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.000
from the time that the cancer is first treated

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:45.000
and then comes back and starts growing again.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.000
Novocure conducted

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.000
its first phase three randomized trial

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.000
in patients with recurrent GBM.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.000
So these are patients

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:59.000
who had received surgery,

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.000
high dose radiation to the head

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.000
and first-line chemotherapy,

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.000
and that had failed and their tumors had grown back.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:09.000
We divided the patients into two groups.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:12.000
The first group received second-line chemotherapy,

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.000
which is expected to double the life expectancy,

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.000
versus no treatment at all.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.000
And then the second group

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:22.000
received only Tumor Treating Field therapy.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.000
What we saw in that trial

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.000
is that that the life expectancies of both groups --

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.000
so the chemotherapy treated group

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000
and the Tumor Treating Field group --

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.000
was the same.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.000
But importantly,

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:38.000
the Tumor Treating Field group

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:41.000
suffered none of the side effects

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:44.000
typical of chemotherapy patients.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000
They had no pain,

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:49.000
suffered none of the infections.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:52.000
They had no nausea, diarrhea,

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:55.000
constipation, fatigue

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.000
that would be expected.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.000
Based on this trial,

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.000
in April of this year,

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:04.000
the FDA approved Tumor Treating Fields

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.000
for the treatment of patients

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:09.000
with recurrent GBM.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.000
Importantly, it was the first time ever

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.000
that the FDA included

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:17.000
in their approval of an oncology treatment

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.000
a quality of life claim.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:24.000
So I'm going to show you now

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.000
one of the patients

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:29.000
from this trial.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.000
Robert Dill-Bundi

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.000
is a famous Swiss cycling champion.

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.000
He won the gold medal in Moscow

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:38.000
in the 4,000 meter pursuit.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:41.000
And five years ago,

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:44.000
Robert was diagnosed with GBM.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.000
He received the standard treatments.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:49.000
He received surgery.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:52.000
He received high dose radiation to the head.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:55.000
And he received first-line chemotherapy.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.000
A year after this treatment --

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:00.000
in fact, this is his baseline MRI.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.000
You can see that the black regions

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.000
in the upper right quadrant

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.000
are the areas where he had surgery.

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.000
And a year after that treatment,

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:12.000
his tumor grew back with a vengeance.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:15.000
That cloudy white mass that you see

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:18.000
is the recurrence of the tumor.

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:21.000
At this point, he was told by his doctors

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:24.000
that he had about 3 months to live.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.000
He entered our trial.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:29.000
And here we can see him getting the therapy.

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:32.000
First of all, these electrodes are noninvasive.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.000
They're attached to the skin

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.000
in the area of the tumor.

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.000
Here you can see

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:41.000
that a technician is placing them on there much like bandages.

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:44.000
The patients learn to do this themselves

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:47.000
And then the patients

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:50.000
can undergo all the activities of their daily life.

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.000
There's none of the tiredness.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:55.000
There's none of what is called the "chemo head."

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.000
There's no sensation.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.000
It doesn't interfere

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:02.000
with computers or electrical equipment.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:04.000
And the therapy is delivered continuously

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:06.000
at home,

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.000
without having to go into the hospital

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:11.000
either periodically or continually.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:14.000
These are Robert's MRIs,

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:17.000
again, under only TTField treatment.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:20.000
This is a therapy that takes time to work.

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.000
It's a medical device;

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.000
it works when it's on.

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.000
But what we can see is, by month six,

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:29.000
the tumor has responded

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:32.000
and it's begun to melt away.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.000
It's still there.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.000
By month 12,

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.000
we could argue whether

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.000
there's a little bit of material around the edges,

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:43.000
but it's essentially completely gone.

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.000
It's now five years

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:47.000
since Robert's diagnosis,

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:50.000
and he's alive,

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.000
but importantly, he's healthy

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.000
and he's at work.

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.000
I'm going to let him, in this very short clip,

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.000
describe his impressions of the therapy

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.000
in his own words.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.000
(Video) Robert Dill-Bundi: My quality of life,

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.000
I rate what I have today

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:08.000
a bit different than what most people would assume.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:13.000
I am the happiest, the happiest person in the world.

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:17.000
And every single morning I appreciate life.

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:20.000
Every night I fall asleep very well,

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:23.000
and I am, I repeat,

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:25.000
the happiest man in the world,

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:28.000
and I'm thankful I am alive.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:33.000
BD: Novocure's also working on lung cancer

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:35.000
as the second target.

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:37.000
We've run a phase two trial

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.000
in Switzerland

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:41.000
on, again, recurrent patients --

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:44.000
patients who have received standard therapy

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:47.000
and whose cancer has come back.

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:49.000
I'm going to show you another clip

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:51.000
of a woman named Lydia.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.000
Lydia's a 66 year-old farmer

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.000
in Switzerland.

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.000
She was diagnosed with lung cancer

00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:59.000
five years ago.

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:02.000
She underwent four different regimes of chemotherapy

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:04.000
over two years,

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:06.000
none of which had an effect.

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.000
Her cancer continued to grow.

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:10.000
Three years ago,

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:14.000
she entered the Novocure lung cancer trial.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.000
You can see, in her case,

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.000
she's wearing her transducer arrays,

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:21.000
one of the front of her chest, one on the back,

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:24.000
and then the second pair side-to-side over the liver.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:27.000
You can see the Tumor Treating Field field generator,

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:30.000
but importantly you can also see that she is living her life.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.000
She is managing her farm.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:35.000
She's interacting with her kids and her grand kids.

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:38.000
And when we talked to her,

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.000
she said that when she was undergoing chemotherapy,

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:43.000
she had to go to the hospital every month for her infusions.

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:45.000
Her whole family suffered

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.000
as her side effect profile came and went.

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:49.000
Now she can run

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:52.000
all of the activities of her farm.

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:54.000
It's only the beginning.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:14:01.000
(Applause)

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:05.000
In the lab, we've observed tremendous synergies

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:08.000
between chemotherapy and Tumor Treating Fields.

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:11.000
There's research underway now at Harvard Medical School

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:13.000
to pick the optimum pairs

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:15.000
to maximize that benefit.

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:18.000
We also believe that Tumor Treating Fields will work with radiation

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:22.000
and interrupt the self-repair mechanisms that we have.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:24.000
There's now a new research project underway

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.000
at the Karolinska in Sweden

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.000
to prove that hypothesis.

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.000
We have more trials planned

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.000
for lung cancer,

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.000
pancreatic cancer, ovarian cancer

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:36.000
and breast cancer.

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:38.000
And I firmly believe

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:40.000
that in the next 10 years

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.000
Tumor Treating Fields

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:45.000
will be a weapon available to doctors and patients

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:50.000
for all of these most-difficult-to-treat solid tumors.

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:53.000
I'm also very hopeful

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:55.000
that in the next decades,

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:57.000
we will make big strides

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:00.000
on reducing that death rate

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:03.000
that has been so challenging in this disease.

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:05.000
Thank you.

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:14.000
(Applause)
