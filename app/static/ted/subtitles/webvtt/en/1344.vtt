00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.550
When I was seven years old
and my sister was just five years old,

00:00:03.574 --> 00:00:05.976
we were playing on top of a bunk bed.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.026
I was two years older
than my sister at the time --

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:11.282
I mean, I'm two years
older than her now --

00:00:11.306 --> 00:00:14.631
but at the time it meant she had to do
everything that I wanted to do,

00:00:14.655 --> 00:00:15.976
and I wanted to play war.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.056
So we were up on top of our bunk beds.

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:20.175
And on one side of the bunk bed,

00:00:20.199 --> 00:00:22.809
I had put out all of my G.I. Joe
soldiers and weaponry.

00:00:22.833 --> 00:00:25.721
And on the other side were
all my sister's My Little Ponies

00:00:25.745 --> 00:00:27.190
ready for a cavalry charge.

00:00:27.214 --> 00:00:30.507
There are differing accounts
of what actually happened that afternoon,

00:00:30.531 --> 00:00:32.819
but since my sister is not
here with us today,

00:00:32.843 --> 00:00:34.739
let me tell you the true story --

00:00:34.763 --> 00:00:35.976
(Laughter)

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.435
which is my sister's a little
on the clumsy side.

00:00:38.459 --> 00:00:41.481
Somehow, without any help or push
from her older brother at all,

00:00:41.505 --> 00:00:43.975
Amy disappeared
off of the top of the bunk bed

00:00:43.999 --> 00:00:45.929
and landed with this crash on the floor.

00:00:45.953 --> 00:00:47.967
I nervously peered
over the side of the bed

00:00:47.991 --> 00:00:49.976
to see what had befallen my fallen sister

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.854
and saw that she had landed
painfully on her hands and knees

00:00:52.878 --> 00:00:54.229
on all fours on the ground.

00:00:54.253 --> 00:00:56.729
I was nervous because
my parents had charged me

00:00:56.753 --> 00:00:58.615
with making sure that my sister and I

00:00:58.639 --> 00:01:00.976
played as safely
and as quietly as possible.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.652
And seeing as how I had
accidentally broken Amy's arm

00:01:04.676 --> 00:01:05.976
just one week before --

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.937
(Laughter)

00:01:10.099 --> 00:01:11.100
(Laughter ends)

00:01:11.124 --> 00:01:15.784
heroically pushing her out of the way
of an oncoming imaginary sniper bullet,

00:01:15.808 --> 00:01:17.842
(Laughter)

00:01:17.866 --> 00:01:21.949
for which I have yet to be thanked,
I was trying as hard as I could --

00:01:21.973 --> 00:01:23.569
she didn't even see it coming --

00:01:23.593 --> 00:01:25.934
I was trying hard
to be on my best behavior.

00:01:25.958 --> 00:01:27.308
And I saw my sister's face,

00:01:27.332 --> 00:01:29.568
this wail of pain
and suffering and surprise

00:01:29.592 --> 00:01:32.276
threatening to erupt from her mouth
and wake my parents

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:34.896
from the long winter's nap
for which they had settled.

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.076
So I did the only thing

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:39.538
my frantic seven year-old brain
could think to do to avert this tragedy.

00:01:39.562 --> 00:01:42.425
And if you have children,
you've seen this hundreds of times.

00:01:42.449 --> 00:01:45.176
I said, "Amy, wait. Don't cry.
Did you see how you landed?

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:47.320
No human lands on all fours like that.

00:01:48.591 --> 00:01:50.976
Amy, I think this means you're a unicorn."

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.369
(Laughter)

00:01:54.393 --> 00:01:55.502
Now, that was cheating,

00:01:55.526 --> 00:01:57.655
because there was nothing
she would want more

00:01:57.679 --> 00:02:00.320
than not to be Amy
the hurt five year-old little sister,

00:02:00.344 --> 00:02:01.776
but Amy the special unicorn.

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:03.924
Of course, this option
was open to her brain

00:02:03.948 --> 00:02:05.132
at no point in the past.

00:02:05.156 --> 00:02:08.253
And you could see how my poor,
manipulated sister faced conflict,

00:02:08.277 --> 00:02:10.654
as her little brain attempted
to devote resources

00:02:10.678 --> 00:02:13.977
to feeling the pain and suffering
and surprise she just experienced,

00:02:14.001 --> 00:02:16.546
or contemplating her new-found
identity as a unicorn.

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:17.676
And the latter won.

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:19.539
Instead of crying or ceasing our play,

00:02:19.563 --> 00:02:20.976
instead of waking my parents,

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.307
with all the negative consequences for me,

00:02:23.331 --> 00:02:24.976
a smile spread across her face

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.092
and she scrambled back up
onto the bunk bed

00:02:27.116 --> 00:02:29.002
with all the grace of a baby unicorn --

00:02:29.026 --> 00:02:31.555
(Laughter)

00:02:31.579 --> 00:02:32.969
with one broken leg.

00:02:32.993 --> 00:02:34.595
What we stumbled across

00:02:34.619 --> 00:02:36.699
at this tender age
of just five and seven --

00:02:36.723 --> 00:02:38.395
we had no idea at the time --

00:02:38.419 --> 00:02:41.520
was was going be at the vanguard
of a scientific revolution

00:02:41.544 --> 00:02:44.998
occurring two decades later in the way
that we look at the human brain.

00:02:45.022 --> 00:02:47.937
We had stumbled across
something called positive psychology,

00:02:47.961 --> 00:02:49.606
which is the reason I'm here today

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:51.718
and the reason that I wake up
every morning.

00:02:51.742 --> 00:02:53.776
When I started talking about this research

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:56.076
outside of academia,
with companies and schools,

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:59.176
the first thing they said to never do
is to start with a graph.

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:01.654
The first thing I want to do
is start with a graph.

00:03:01.678 --> 00:03:02.976
This graph looks boring,

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.951
but it is the reason I get excited
and wake up every morning.

00:03:05.975 --> 00:03:08.740
And this graph doesn't even mean
anything; it's fake data.

00:03:08.764 --> 00:03:10.035
What we found is --

00:03:10.059 --> 00:03:12.976
(Laughter)

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.976
If I got this data studying you,
I would be thrilled,

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.976
because there's a trend there,

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.976
and that means that I can get published,

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:21.976
which is all that really matters.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.076
There is one weird red dot
above the curve,

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:26.601
there's one weirdo in the room --

00:03:26.625 --> 00:03:29.650
I know who you are, I saw you earlier --

00:03:29.674 --> 00:03:30.976
that's no problem.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.976
That's no problem, as most of you know,
because I can just delete that dot.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.104
I can delete that dot because
that's clearly a measurement error.

00:03:38.128 --> 00:03:41.494
And we know that's a measurement error
because it's messing up my data.

00:03:41.518 --> 00:03:42.557
(Laughter)

00:03:42.581 --> 00:03:44.744
So one of the first things we teach people

00:03:44.768 --> 00:03:47.584
in economics, statistics,
business and psychology courses

00:03:47.608 --> 00:03:50.773
is how, in a statistically valid way,
do we eliminate the weirdos.

00:03:50.797 --> 00:03:54.176
How do we eliminate the outliers
so we can find the line of best fit?

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:56.296
Which is fantastic
if I'm trying to find out

00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:59.076
how many Advil the average
person should be taking -- two.

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:01.911
But if I'm interested in your potential,

00:04:01.935 --> 00:04:04.976
or for happiness or productivity
or energy or creativity,

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.571
we're creating the cult
of the average with science.

00:04:07.595 --> 00:04:08.976
If I asked a question like,

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.697
"How fast can a child learn
how to read in a classroom?"

00:04:11.721 --> 00:04:13.206
scientists change the answer to

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:16.569
"How fast does the average child
learn how to read in that classroom?"

00:04:16.593 --> 00:04:18.739
and we tailor the class
towards the average.

00:04:18.763 --> 00:04:20.286
If you fall below the average,

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:21.903
then psychologists get thrilled,

00:04:21.927 --> 00:04:24.743
because that means you're
depressed or have a disorder,

00:04:24.767 --> 00:04:25.976
or hopefully both.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.476
We're hoping for both
because our business model is,

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:30.976
if you come into a therapy
session with one problem,

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.476
we want to make sure you
leave knowing you have ten,

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:34.676
so you keep coming back.

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:36.915
We'll go back into your
childhood if necessary,

00:04:36.939 --> 00:04:39.215
but eventually we want
to make you normal again.

00:04:39.239 --> 00:04:40.676
But normal is merely average.

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:44.048
And positive psychology posits
that if we study what is merely average,

00:04:44.072 --> 00:04:46.404
we will remain merely average.

00:04:46.428 --> 00:04:48.722
Then instead of deleting
those positive outliers,

00:04:48.746 --> 00:04:51.788
what I intentionally do is come
into a population like this one

00:04:51.812 --> 00:04:52.828
and say, why?

00:04:52.852 --> 00:04:54.776
Why are some of you high above the curve

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:57.385
in terms of intellectual,
athletic, musical ability,

00:04:57.409 --> 00:04:58.676
creativity, energy levels,

00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:01.176
resiliency in the face
of challenge, sense of humor?

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:04.743
Whatever it is, instead of deleting
you, what I want to do is study you.

00:05:04.767 --> 00:05:06.676
Because maybe we can glean information,

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:08.854
not just how to move
people up to the average,

00:05:08.878 --> 00:05:12.276
but move the entire average up
in our companies and schools worldwide.

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:14.276
The reason this graph is important to me

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:17.376
is, on the news, the majority
of the information is not positive.

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:18.476
in fact it's negative.

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:21.676
Most of it's about murder, corruption,
diseases, natural disasters.

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:23.776
And very quickly, my brain starts to think

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:26.795
that's the accurate ratio
of negative to positive in the world.

00:05:26.819 --> 00:05:29.023
This creates
"the medical school syndrome."

00:05:29.047 --> 00:05:31.603
During the first year of medical training,

00:05:31.627 --> 00:05:35.015
as you read through a list of all
the symptoms and diseases,

00:05:35.039 --> 00:05:37.270
suddenly you realize you have all of them.

00:05:37.294 --> 00:05:38.295
(Laughter)

00:05:38.319 --> 00:05:41.391
I have a brother in-law named Bobo,
which is a whole other story.

00:05:41.415 --> 00:05:42.977
Bobo married Amy the unicorn.

00:05:43.001 --> 00:05:44.733
Bobo called me on the phone --

00:05:44.757 --> 00:05:46.902
(Laughter)

00:05:46.926 --> 00:05:48.976
from Yale Medical School,

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.281
and Bobo said, "Shawn, I have leprosy."

00:05:51.305 --> 00:05:52.976
(Laughter)

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.587
Which, even at Yale,
is extraordinarily rare.

00:05:55.611 --> 00:05:57.976
But I had no idea how to console poor Bobo

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.858
because he had just gotten
over an entire week of menopause.

00:06:00.882 --> 00:06:01.976
(Laughter)

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.976
We're finding it's not necessarily
the reality that shapes us,

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.776
but the lens through which your brain
views the world that shapes your reality.

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:12.077
And if we can change the lens,
not only can we change your happiness,

00:06:12.101 --> 00:06:15.749
we can change every single educational
and business outcome at the same time.

00:06:15.773 --> 00:06:17.276
I applied to Harvard on a dare.

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:20.476
I didn't expect to get in, and my family
had no money for college.

00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:23.676
When I got a military scholarship
two weeks later, they let me go.

00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:26.476
Something that wasn't
even a possibility became a reality.

00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:29.476
I assumed everyone there
would see it as a privilege as well,

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:31.176
that they'd be excited to be there.

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:33.676
Even in a classroom
full of people smarter than you,

00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:36.176
I felt you'd be happy just to be
in that classroom.

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:38.876
But what I found is,
while some people experience that,

00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:40.676
when I graduated after my four years

00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:44.277
and then spent the next eight years
living in the dorms with the students --

00:06:44.301 --> 00:06:46.180
Harvard asked me to; I wasn't that guy.

00:06:46.204 --> 00:06:47.976
(Laughter)

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.376
I was an officer to counsel students
through the difficult four years.

00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:53.167
And in my research and my teaching,

00:06:53.191 --> 00:06:55.967
I found that these students,
no matter how happy they were

00:06:55.991 --> 00:06:58.676
with their original success
of getting into the school,

00:06:58.700 --> 00:07:02.476
two weeks later their brains were focused,
not on the privilege of being there,

00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:04.176
nor on their philosophy or physics,

00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:05.976
but on the competition, the workload,

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:07.676
the hassles, stresses, complaints.

00:07:07.700 --> 00:07:10.876
When I first went in there, I walked
into the freshmen dining hall,

00:07:10.900 --> 00:07:14.276
which is where my friends from Waco,
Texas, which is where I grew up --

00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:15.776
I know some of you know this.

00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:17.676
When they'd visit, they'd look around,

00:07:17.700 --> 00:07:20.876
and say, "This dining hall looks like
something out of Hogwart's."

00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:23.476
It does, because that was Hogwart's
and that's Harvard.

00:07:23.500 --> 00:07:24.676
And when they see this,

00:07:24.700 --> 00:07:27.976
they say, "Why do you waste your time
studying happiness at Harvard?

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:31.076
What does a Harvard student
possibly have to be unhappy about?"

00:07:31.100 --> 00:07:32.576
Embedded within that question

00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:35.176
is the key to understanding
the science of happiness.

00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:36.876
Because what that question assumes

00:07:36.900 --> 00:07:39.972
is that our external world
is predictive of our happiness levels,

00:07:39.996 --> 00:07:43.072
when in reality, if I know everything
about your external world,

00:07:43.096 --> 00:07:45.576
I can only predict 10%
of your long-term happiness.

00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:49.376
90 percent of your long-term happiness
is predicted not by the external world,

00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:51.591
but by the way your brain
processes the world.

00:07:51.615 --> 00:07:52.676
And if we change it,

00:07:52.700 --> 00:07:55.129
if we change our formula
for happiness and success,

00:07:55.153 --> 00:07:57.975
we can change the way
that we can then affect reality.

00:07:57.999 --> 00:08:01.976
What we found is that only 25%
of job successes are predicted by IQ,

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:03.976
75 percent of job successes

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.976
are predicted by your optimism
levels, your social support

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:10.276
and your ability to see stress
as a challenge instead of as a threat.

00:08:10.300 --> 00:08:13.976
I talked to a New England boarding school,
probably the most prestigious one,

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:15.776
and they said, "We already know that.

00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:19.476
So every year, instead of just teaching
our students, we have a wellness week.

00:08:19.500 --> 00:08:22.776
And we're so excited. Monday night
we have the world's leading expert

00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:24.676
will speak about adolescent depression.

00:08:24.700 --> 00:08:26.939
Tuesday night
it's school violence and bullying.

00:08:26.963 --> 00:08:28.776
Wednesday night is eating disorders.

00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:30.476
Thursday night is illicit drug use.

00:08:30.500 --> 00:08:33.929
And Friday night we're trying to decide
between risky sex or happiness."

00:08:33.953 --> 00:08:34.976
(Laughter)

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.143
I said, "That's most people's
Friday nights."

00:08:37.167 --> 00:08:39.976
(Laughter)

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.976
(Applause)

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.858
Which I'm glad you liked,
but they did not like that at all.

00:08:45.882 --> 00:08:46.976
Silence on the phone.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:50.276
And into the silence, I said,
"I'd be happy to speak at your school,

00:08:50.300 --> 00:08:52.976
but that's not a wellness week,
that's a sickness week.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.676
You've outlined all the negative
things that can happen,

00:08:55.700 --> 00:08:57.376
but not talked about the positive."

00:08:57.400 --> 00:08:59.176
The absence of disease is not health.

00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:00.576
Here's how we get to health:

00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:03.376
We need to reverse the formula
for happiness and success.

00:09:03.400 --> 00:09:06.076
In the last three years,
I've traveled to 45 countries,

00:09:06.100 --> 00:09:09.576
working with schools and companies
in the midst of an economic downturn.

00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:11.676
And I found that
most companies and schools

00:09:11.700 --> 00:09:13.772
follow a formula
for success, which is this:

00:09:13.796 --> 00:09:15.872
If I work harder, I'll be more successful.

00:09:15.896 --> 00:09:18.276
And if I'm more successful,
then I'll be happier.

00:09:18.300 --> 00:09:21.076
That undergirds most
of our parenting and managing styles,

00:09:21.100 --> 00:09:22.976
the way that we motivate our behavior.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:26.620
And the problem is it's scientifically
broken and backwards for two reasons.

00:09:26.644 --> 00:09:28.376
Every time your brain has a success,

00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:31.176
you just changed the goalpost
of what success looked like.

00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:33.877
You got good grades,
now you have to get better grades,

00:09:33.901 --> 00:09:36.872
you got into a good school
and after you get into a better one,

00:09:36.896 --> 00:09:39.473
you got a good job,
now you have to get a better job,

00:09:39.497 --> 00:09:41.974
you hit your sales target,
we're going to change it.

00:09:41.998 --> 00:09:45.875
And if happiness is on the opposite side
of success, your brain never gets there.

00:09:45.899 --> 00:09:48.976
We've pushed happiness
over the cognitive horizon, as a society.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.524
And that's because we think
we have to be successful,

00:09:51.548 --> 00:09:52.672
then we'll be happier.

00:09:52.696 --> 00:09:54.771
But our brains work in the opposite order.

00:09:54.795 --> 00:09:57.772
If you can raise somebody's level
of positivity in the present,

00:09:57.796 --> 00:10:01.036
then their brain experiences what we now
call a happiness advantage,

00:10:01.060 --> 00:10:03.974
which is your brain at positive
performs significantly better

00:10:03.998 --> 00:10:05.866
than at negative, neutral or stressed.

00:10:05.890 --> 00:10:09.320
Your intelligence rises, your creativity
rises, your energy levels rise.

00:10:09.344 --> 00:10:12.515
In fact, we've found that every single
business outcome improves.

00:10:12.539 --> 00:10:14.668
Your brain at positive
is 31% more productive

00:10:14.692 --> 00:10:17.002
than your brain at negative,
neutral or stressed.

00:10:17.026 --> 00:10:18.402
You're 37% better at sales.

00:10:18.426 --> 00:10:20.522
Doctors are 19 percent
faster, more accurate

00:10:20.546 --> 00:10:22.476
at coming up with the correct diagnosis

00:10:22.500 --> 00:10:25.176
when positive instead
of negative, neutral or stressed.

00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:27.076
Which means we can reverse the formula.

00:10:27.100 --> 00:10:29.876
If we can find a way of becoming
positive in the present,

00:10:29.900 --> 00:10:31.948
then our brains work
even more successfully

00:10:31.972 --> 00:10:34.876
as we're able to work harder,
faster and more intelligently.

00:10:34.900 --> 00:10:36.976
We need to be able to reverse this formula

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.976
so we can start to see what our brains
are actually capable of.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:43.276
Because dopamine, which floods
into your system when you're positive,

00:10:43.300 --> 00:10:44.364
has two functions.

00:10:44.388 --> 00:10:46.365
Not only does it make you happier,

00:10:46.389 --> 00:10:48.966
it turns on all of the learning
centers in your brain

00:10:48.990 --> 00:10:51.567
allowing you to adapt
to the world in a different way.

00:10:51.591 --> 00:10:54.268
We've found there are ways
that you can train your brain

00:10:54.292 --> 00:10:55.969
to be able to become more positive.

00:10:55.993 --> 00:10:58.963
In just a two-minute span of time
done for 21 days in a row,

00:10:58.987 --> 00:11:00.664
we can actually rewire your brain,

00:11:00.688 --> 00:11:04.565
allowing your brain to actually work
more optimistically and more successfully.

00:11:04.589 --> 00:11:06.466
We've done these things in research now

00:11:06.490 --> 00:11:08.467
in every company that I've worked with,

00:11:08.491 --> 00:11:11.768
getting them to write down three new
things that they're grateful for

00:11:11.792 --> 00:11:14.079
for 21 days in a row,
three new things each day.

00:11:14.103 --> 00:11:15.270
And at the end of that,

00:11:15.294 --> 00:11:17.171
their brain starts to retain a pattern

00:11:17.195 --> 00:11:20.672
of scanning the world not for
the negative, but for the positive first.

00:11:20.696 --> 00:11:24.273
Journaling about one positive experience
you've had over the past 24 hours

00:11:24.297 --> 00:11:25.856
allows your brain to relive it.

00:11:25.880 --> 00:11:28.537
Exercise teaches your brain
that your behavior matters.

00:11:28.561 --> 00:11:30.538
We find that meditation allows your brain

00:11:30.562 --> 00:11:33.139
to get over the cultural ADHD
that we've been creating

00:11:33.163 --> 00:11:35.040
by trying to do multiple tasks at once

00:11:35.064 --> 00:11:37.541
and allows our brains
to focus on the task at hand.

00:11:37.565 --> 00:11:40.842
And finally, random acts of kindness
are conscious acts of kindness.

00:11:40.866 --> 00:11:43.010
We get people,
when they open up their inbox,

00:11:43.034 --> 00:11:44.344
to write one positive email

00:11:44.368 --> 00:11:47.045
praising or thanking somebody
in their support network.

00:11:47.069 --> 00:11:48.546
And by doing these activities

00:11:48.570 --> 00:11:51.247
and by training your brain
just like we train our bodies,

00:11:51.271 --> 00:11:54.748
what we've found is we can reverse
the formula for happiness and success,

00:11:54.772 --> 00:11:57.475
and in doing so, not only create
ripples of positivity,

00:11:57.499 --> 00:11:58.576
but a real revolution.

00:11:58.600 --> 00:11:59.676
Thank you very much.

00:11:59.700 --> 00:12:00.700
(Applause)
