00:00:00.809 --> 00:00:02.270
I'm going to talk to you today

00:00:02.294 --> 00:00:05.777
about the design of medical technology
for low-resource settings.

00:00:05.801 --> 00:00:08.154
I study health systems in these countries.

00:00:08.178 --> 00:00:10.093
And one of the major gaps in care,

00:00:10.117 --> 00:00:11.776
almost across the board,

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:13.967
is access to safe surgery.

00:00:13.991 --> 00:00:16.650
Now one of the major
bottlenecks that we've found

00:00:16.674 --> 00:00:19.909
that's sort of preventing
both the access in the first place,

00:00:19.933 --> 00:00:23.369
and the safety of those surgeries
that do happen, is anesthesia.

00:00:23.846 --> 00:00:26.238
And actually, it's the model
that we expect to work

00:00:26.262 --> 00:00:28.961
for delivering anesthesia
in these environments.

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:33.473
Here, we have a scene that you would find
in any operating room across the US,

00:00:33.497 --> 00:00:34.974
or any other developed country.

00:00:34.998 --> 00:00:36.185
In the background there

00:00:36.209 --> 00:00:38.780
is a very sophisticated
anesthesia machine.

00:00:38.804 --> 00:00:42.653
And this machine is able
to enable surgery and save lives

00:00:42.677 --> 00:00:45.976
because it was designed
with this environment in mind.

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:49.261
In order to operate,
this machine needs a number of things

00:00:49.285 --> 00:00:51.185
that this hospital has to offer.

00:00:51.209 --> 00:00:54.577
It needs an extremely
well-trained anesthesiologist

00:00:54.601 --> 00:00:57.052
with years of training
with complex machines

00:00:57.076 --> 00:00:59.497
to help her monitor the flows of the gas

00:00:59.521 --> 00:01:02.084
and keep her patients
safe and anesthetized

00:01:02.108 --> 00:01:03.559
throughout the surgery.

00:01:03.583 --> 00:01:06.350
It's a delicate machine
running on computer algorithms,

00:01:06.374 --> 00:01:09.592
and it needs special care, TLC,
to keep it up and running,

00:01:09.616 --> 00:01:11.474
and it's going to break pretty easily.

00:01:11.498 --> 00:01:14.410
And when it does, it needs
a team of biomedical engineers

00:01:14.434 --> 00:01:17.743
who understand its complexities,
can fix it, can source the parts

00:01:17.767 --> 00:01:19.999
and keep it saving lives.

00:01:20.688 --> 00:01:22.222
It's a pretty expensive machine.

00:01:22.246 --> 00:01:24.887
It needs a hospital
whose budget can allow it

00:01:24.911 --> 00:01:29.805
to support one machine
costing upwards of 50 or $100,000.

00:01:30.296 --> 00:01:32.195
And perhaps most obviously,

00:01:32.219 --> 00:01:33.733
but also most importantly --

00:01:33.757 --> 00:01:36.593
and the path to concepts
that we've heard about

00:01:36.617 --> 00:01:37.903
kind of illustrates this --

00:01:37.927 --> 00:01:43.073
it needs infrastructure that can supply
an uninterrupted source of electricity,

00:01:43.097 --> 00:01:46.109
of compressed oxygen,
and other medical supplies

00:01:46.133 --> 00:01:50.411
that are so critical
to the functioning of this machine.

00:01:50.435 --> 00:01:53.734
In other words, this machine
requires a lot of stuff

00:01:53.758 --> 00:01:55.731
that this hospital cannot offer.

00:01:56.332 --> 00:01:59.352
This is the electrical supply
for a hospital in rural Malawi.

00:02:00.153 --> 00:02:01.314
In this hospital,

00:02:01.338 --> 00:02:04.009
there is one person qualified
to deliver anesthesia,

00:02:04.033 --> 00:02:05.185
and she's qualified

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:09.785
because she has 12, maybe 18 months
of training in anesthesia.

00:02:09.809 --> 00:02:12.056
In the hospital and in the entire region

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:14.087
there's not a single biomedical engineer.

00:02:14.111 --> 00:02:15.680
So when this machine breaks,

00:02:15.704 --> 00:02:17.913
the machines that they have
to work with break,

00:02:17.937 --> 00:02:19.706
they've got to try and figure it out,

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:22.022
but most of the time,
that's the end of the road.

00:02:22.046 --> 00:02:24.263
Those machines go the proverbial junkyard.

00:02:24.287 --> 00:02:26.616
And the price tag
of the machine that I mentioned

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:28.701
could represent maybe a quarter or a third

00:02:28.725 --> 00:02:31.537
of the annual operating budget
for this hospital.

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:35.964
And finally, I think you can see
that infrastructure is not very strong.

00:02:35.988 --> 00:02:38.662
This hospital is connected
to a very weak power grid,

00:02:38.686 --> 00:02:40.468
one that goes down frequently.

00:02:40.492 --> 00:02:43.038
So it runs frequently,
the entire hospital,

00:02:43.062 --> 00:02:44.485
just on a generator.

00:02:44.509 --> 00:02:46.665
And you can imagine,
the generator breaks down

00:02:46.689 --> 00:02:48.001
or runs out of fuel.

00:02:48.361 --> 00:02:50.388
And the World Bank sees this

00:02:50.412 --> 00:02:53.943
and estimates that a hospital
in this setting in a low-income country

00:02:53.967 --> 00:02:57.043
can expect up to
18 power outages per month.

00:02:58.658 --> 00:03:01.851
Similarly, compressed oxygen
and other medical supplies

00:03:01.875 --> 00:03:03.057
are really a luxury,

00:03:03.081 --> 00:03:06.363
and can often be out of stock
for months or even a year.

00:03:06.387 --> 00:03:09.551
So it seems crazy, but the model
that we have right now

00:03:09.575 --> 00:03:11.780
is taking those machines
that were designed

00:03:11.804 --> 00:03:14.087
for that first environment
that I showed you

00:03:14.111 --> 00:03:17.975
and donating or selling them
to hospitals in this environment.

00:03:18.861 --> 00:03:20.437
It's not just inappropriate,

00:03:20.461 --> 00:03:22.999
it becomes really unsafe.

00:03:23.516 --> 00:03:25.438
One of our partners at Johns Hopkins

00:03:25.462 --> 00:03:29.641
was observing surgeries in Sierra Leone
about a year ago.

00:03:30.225 --> 00:03:33.558
And the first surgery of the day
happened to be an obstetrical case.

00:03:33.582 --> 00:03:36.565
A woman came in,
she needed an emergency C-section

00:03:36.589 --> 00:03:39.318
to save her life and the life of her baby.

00:03:39.805 --> 00:03:41.759
And everything began pretty auspiciously.

00:03:41.783 --> 00:03:44.036
The surgeon was on call and scrubbed in.

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:45.348
The nurse was there.

00:03:45.372 --> 00:03:48.233
She was able to anesthetize her quickly,
and it was important

00:03:48.257 --> 00:03:50.593
because of the emergency
nature of the situation.

00:03:50.617 --> 00:03:52.334
And everything began well

00:03:52.358 --> 00:03:54.430
until the power went out.

00:03:55.773 --> 00:03:57.597
And now in the middle of this surgery,

00:03:57.621 --> 00:04:00.690
the surgeon is racing
against the clock to finish his case,

00:04:00.714 --> 00:04:03.066
which he can do -- he's got a headlamp.

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:07.151
But the nurse is literally running
around a darkened operating theater

00:04:07.175 --> 00:04:10.130
trying to find anything
she can use to anesthetize her patient,

00:04:10.154 --> 00:04:11.843
to keep her patient asleep.

00:04:11.867 --> 00:04:14.750
Because her machine doesn't work
when there's no power.

00:04:15.437 --> 00:04:18.491
This routine surgery that many of you
have probably experienced,

00:04:18.515 --> 00:04:22.989
and others are probably the product of,
has now become a tragedy.

00:04:23.655 --> 00:04:26.391
And what's so frustrating
is this is not a singular event;

00:04:26.415 --> 00:04:28.914
this happens across the developing world.

00:04:28.938 --> 00:04:31.891
35 million surgeries
are attempted every year

00:04:31.915 --> 00:04:33.511
without safe anesthesia.

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:37.122
My colleague, Dr. Paul Fenton,
was living this reality.

00:04:37.146 --> 00:04:38.976
He was the chief of anesthesiology

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.500
in a hospital in Malawi,
a teaching hospital.

00:04:42.028 --> 00:04:43.522
He went to work every day

00:04:43.546 --> 00:04:45.514
in an operating theater like this one,

00:04:45.538 --> 00:04:48.677
trying to deliver anesthesia
and teach others how to do so

00:04:48.701 --> 00:04:49.976
using that same equipment

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:54.311
that became so unreliable,
and frankly unsafe, in his hospital.

00:04:55.039 --> 00:04:56.819
And after umpteen surgeries

00:04:56.843 --> 00:04:59.411
and, you can imagine,
really unspeakable tragedy,

00:04:59.435 --> 00:05:01.777
he just said, "That's it.
I'm done. That's enough.

00:05:01.801 --> 00:05:03.871
There has to be something better."

00:05:04.229 --> 00:05:05.776
He took a walk down the hall

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:09.231
to where they threw all those machines
that had just crapped out on them,

00:05:09.255 --> 00:05:10.932
I think that's the scientific term,

00:05:10.956 --> 00:05:12.298
and he started tinkering.

00:05:12.322 --> 00:05:14.675
He took one part from here
and another from there,

00:05:14.699 --> 00:05:17.281
and he tried to come up
with a machine that would work

00:05:17.305 --> 00:05:18.933
in the reality that he was facing.

00:05:18.957 --> 00:05:20.171
And what he came up with:

00:05:20.195 --> 00:05:21.518
was this guy.

00:05:21.542 --> 00:05:25.079
The prototype for the Universal
Anesthesia Machine --

00:05:25.103 --> 00:05:28.400
a machine that would work
and anesthetize his patients

00:05:28.424 --> 00:05:31.999
no matter the circumstances
that his hospital had to offer.

00:05:32.519 --> 00:05:34.000
Here it is, back at home

00:05:34.024 --> 00:05:37.453
at that same hospital, developed
a little further, 12 years later,

00:05:37.477 --> 00:05:40.657
working on patients
from pediatrics to geriatrics.

00:05:41.137 --> 00:05:43.907
Let me show you a little bit
about how this machine works.

00:05:43.931 --> 00:05:45.809
Voila!

00:05:46.452 --> 00:05:47.659
Here she is.

00:05:47.683 --> 00:05:48.927
When you have electricity,

00:05:48.951 --> 00:05:51.969
everything in this machine
begins in the base.

00:05:51.993 --> 00:05:54.590
There's a built-in
oxygen concentrator down there.

00:05:54.614 --> 00:05:57.743
Now you've heard me mention
oxygen a few times at this point.

00:05:57.767 --> 00:06:01.555
Essentially, to deliver anesthesia,
you want as pure oxygen as possible,

00:06:01.579 --> 00:06:05.002
because eventually you're going
to dilute it, essentially, with the gas.

00:06:05.026 --> 00:06:07.462
And the mixture that the patient inhales

00:06:07.486 --> 00:06:09.797
needs to be at least
a certain percentage oxygen

00:06:09.821 --> 00:06:11.507
or else it can become dangerous.

00:06:11.531 --> 00:06:13.449
But so in here when there's electricity,

00:06:13.473 --> 00:06:16.348
the oxygen concentrator takes in room air.

00:06:16.372 --> 00:06:19.651
Now we know room air is gloriously free,

00:06:19.675 --> 00:06:20.976
it is abundant,

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:22.999
and it's already 21 percent oxygen.

00:06:23.436 --> 00:06:27.113
So all this concentrator does
is take that room air in, filter it

00:06:27.137 --> 00:06:30.957
and send 95 percent pure oxygen
up and across here,

00:06:30.981 --> 00:06:33.187
where it mixes with the anesthetic agent.

00:06:33.743 --> 00:06:37.367
Now before that mixture
hits the patient's lungs,

00:06:37.391 --> 00:06:39.605
it's going to pass by here --
you can't see it,

00:06:39.629 --> 00:06:41.411
but there's an oxygen sensor here --

00:06:41.435 --> 00:06:45.640
that's going to read out on this screen
the percentage of oxygen being delivered.

00:06:46.284 --> 00:06:48.258
Now if you don't have power,

00:06:48.282 --> 00:06:51.888
or, God forbid, the power cuts out
in the middle of a surgery,

00:06:51.912 --> 00:06:54.256
this machine transitions automatically,

00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:56.029
without even having to touch it,

00:06:56.053 --> 00:06:58.384
to drawing in room air from this inlet.

00:06:58.805 --> 00:07:00.141
Everything else is the same.

00:07:00.165 --> 00:07:01.761
The only difference is that now

00:07:01.785 --> 00:07:04.999
you're only working
with 21 percent oxygen.

00:07:05.406 --> 00:07:08.227
Now that used to be
a dangerous guessing game,

00:07:08.251 --> 00:07:10.637
because you only knew
if you gave too little oxygen

00:07:10.661 --> 00:07:12.037
once something bad happened.

00:07:12.061 --> 00:07:14.774
But we've put a long-life
battery backup on here.

00:07:14.798 --> 00:07:16.992
This is the only part
that's battery backed up.

00:07:17.016 --> 00:07:20.421
But this gives control to the provider,
whether there's power or not,

00:07:20.445 --> 00:07:22.038
because they can adjust the flows

00:07:22.062 --> 00:07:26.030
based on the percentage of oxygen
they see that they're giving the patient.

00:07:26.054 --> 00:07:29.399
In both cases,
whether you have power or not,

00:07:29.423 --> 00:07:31.463
sometimes the patient
needs help breathing.

00:07:31.487 --> 00:07:34.688
It's just a reality of anesthesia,
the lungs can be paralyzed.

00:07:34.712 --> 00:07:36.796
And so we've just added
this manual bellows.

00:07:36.820 --> 00:07:39.811
We've seen surgeries
for three or four hours

00:07:39.835 --> 00:07:41.693
to ventilate the patient on this.

00:07:42.424 --> 00:07:45.412
So it's a straightforward machine.

00:07:45.436 --> 00:07:48.341
I shudder to say simple;
it's straightforward.

00:07:48.936 --> 00:07:50.837
And it's by design.

00:07:50.861 --> 00:07:56.061
You do not need to be a highly trained,
specialized anesthesiologist

00:07:56.085 --> 00:07:57.256
to use this machine,

00:07:57.280 --> 00:08:00.032
which is good because,
in these rural district hospitals,

00:08:00.056 --> 00:08:02.651
you're not going to get
that level of training.

00:08:02.675 --> 00:08:05.803
It's also designed for the environment
that it will be used in.

00:08:05.827 --> 00:08:07.604
This is an incredibly rugged machine.

00:08:07.628 --> 00:08:11.083
It has to stand up to the heat
and the wear and tear

00:08:11.107 --> 00:08:14.225
that happens in hospitals
in these rural districts.

00:08:14.249 --> 00:08:16.644
And so it's not going
to break very easily,

00:08:16.668 --> 00:08:19.942
but if it does, virtually
every piece in this machine

00:08:19.966 --> 00:08:21.976
can be swapped out and replaced

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:23.994
with a hex wrench and a screwdriver.

00:08:25.750 --> 00:08:28.010
And finally, it's affordable.

00:08:28.034 --> 00:08:31.687
This machine comes in
at an eighth of the cost

00:08:31.711 --> 00:08:34.789
of the conventional machine
that I showed you earlier.

00:08:34.813 --> 00:08:39.301
So in other words, what we have here
is a machine that can enable surgery

00:08:39.325 --> 00:08:40.497
and save lives,

00:08:40.521 --> 00:08:43.511
because it was designed
for its environment,

00:08:43.535 --> 00:08:45.953
just like the first machine I showed you.

00:08:45.977 --> 00:08:47.981
But we're not content to stop there.

00:08:48.005 --> 00:08:49.180
Is it working?

00:08:49.204 --> 00:08:51.786
Is this the design
that's going to work in place?

00:08:51.810 --> 00:08:53.577
Well, we've seen good results so far.

00:08:53.601 --> 00:08:56.986
This is in 13 hospitals in four countries,

00:08:57.010 --> 00:09:00.943
and since 2010, we've done
well over 2,000 surgeries

00:09:00.967 --> 00:09:03.200
with no clinically adverse events.

00:09:03.540 --> 00:09:04.707
So we're thrilled.

00:09:04.731 --> 00:09:09.153
This really seems like
a cost-effective, scalable solution

00:09:09.177 --> 00:09:11.210
to a problem that's really pervasive.

00:09:11.698 --> 00:09:13.298
But we still want to be sure

00:09:13.322 --> 00:09:15.739
that this is the most effective
and safe device

00:09:15.763 --> 00:09:17.820
that we can be putting into hospitals.

00:09:17.844 --> 00:09:20.368
So to do that, we've launched
a number of partnerships

00:09:20.392 --> 00:09:21.878
with NGOs and universities,

00:09:21.902 --> 00:09:24.551
to gather data on the user interface,

00:09:24.575 --> 00:09:26.767
on the types of surgeries
it's appropriate for,

00:09:26.791 --> 00:09:29.178
and ways we can enhance the device itself.

00:09:29.202 --> 00:09:31.856
One of those partnerships
is with Johns Hopkins

00:09:31.880 --> 00:09:33.253
just here in Baltimore.

00:09:33.277 --> 00:09:37.555
They have a really cool anesthesia
simulation lab out in Baltimore.

00:09:37.579 --> 00:09:39.460
So we're taking this machine

00:09:39.484 --> 00:09:43.058
and recreating some
of the operating theater crises

00:09:43.082 --> 00:09:44.589
that this machine might face

00:09:44.613 --> 00:09:46.976
in one of the hospitals
that it's intended for,

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.124
and in a contained, safe environment,

00:09:49.148 --> 00:09:50.865
evaluating its effectiveness.

00:09:51.347 --> 00:09:54.979
We're then able to compare
the results from that study

00:09:55.003 --> 00:09:56.423
with real-world experience,

00:09:56.447 --> 00:09:58.644
because we're putting
two of these in hospitals

00:09:58.668 --> 00:10:00.819
that Johns Hopkins
works with in Sierra Leone,

00:10:00.843 --> 00:10:03.957
including the hospital
where that emergency C-section happened.

00:10:05.385 --> 00:10:08.513
So I've talked a lot about anesthesia,
and I tend to do that.

00:10:08.537 --> 00:10:12.629
I think it is incredibly fascinating
and an important component of health.

00:10:12.653 --> 00:10:15.284
And it really seems peripheral,
we never think about it,

00:10:15.308 --> 00:10:17.512
until we don't have access to it,

00:10:17.536 --> 00:10:19.498
and then it becomes a gatekeeper.

00:10:19.522 --> 00:10:21.491
Who gets surgery and who doesn't?

00:10:21.824 --> 00:10:24.554
Who gets safe surgery and who doesn't?

00:10:25.216 --> 00:10:27.679
But you know,
it's just one of so many ways

00:10:27.703 --> 00:10:30.810
that design, appropriate design,

00:10:30.834 --> 00:10:32.810
can have an impact on health outcomes.

00:10:33.318 --> 00:10:35.437
If more people
in the health-delivery space

00:10:35.461 --> 00:10:39.030
really working on some of these
challenges in low-income countries

00:10:39.054 --> 00:10:42.707
could start their design process,
their solution search,

00:10:42.731 --> 00:10:44.669
from outside of that proverbial box

00:10:44.693 --> 00:10:46.631
and inside of the hospital --

00:10:46.655 --> 00:10:48.486
In other words, if we could design

00:10:48.510 --> 00:10:51.701
for the environment that exists
in so many parts of the world,

00:10:51.725 --> 00:10:54.134
rather than the one
that we wished existed --

00:10:54.158 --> 00:10:56.324
we might just save a lot of lives.

00:10:56.787 --> 00:10:58.255
Thank you very much.

00:10:58.279 --> 00:11:02.714
