WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Because I usually take the role

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
of trying to explain to people

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
how wonderful the new technologies

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
that are coming along are going to be,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
and I thought that, since I was among friends here,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
I would tell you what I really think

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
and try to look back and try to understand

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
what is really going on here

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.000
with these amazing jumps in technology

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
that seem so fast that we can barely keep on top of it.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
So I'm going to start out

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
by showing just one very boring technology slide.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
And then, so if you can just turn on the slide that's on.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
This is just a random slide

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
that I picked out of my file.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
What I want to show you is not so much the details of the slide,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
but the general form of it.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
This happens to be a slide of some analysis that we were doing

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
about the power of RISC microprocessors

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
versus the power of local area networks.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
And the interesting thing about it

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
is that this slide,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
like so many technology slides that we're used to,

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
is a sort of a straight line

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
on a semi-log curve.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
In other words, every step here

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
represents an order of magnitude

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
in performance scale.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
And this is a new thing

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
that we talk about technology

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
on semi-log curves.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
Something really weird is going on here.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
And that's basically what I'm going to be talking about.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
So, if you could bring up the lights.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
If you could bring up the lights higher,

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
because I'm just going to use a piece of paper here.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
Now why do we draw technology curves

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
in semi-log curves?

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
Well the answer is, if I drew it on a normal curve

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
where, let's say, this is years,

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
this is time of some sort,

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
and this is whatever measure of the technology

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
that I'm trying to graph,

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
the graphs look sort of silly.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
They sort of go like this.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
And they don't tell us much.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
Now if I graph, for instance,

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
some other technology, say transportation technology,

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
on a semi-log curve,

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
it would look very stupid, it would look like a flat line.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
But when something like this happens,

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
things are qualitatively changing.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
So if transportation technology

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000
was moving along as fast as microprocessor technology,

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
then the day after tomorrow,

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
I would be able to get in a taxi cab

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
and be in Tokyo in 30 seconds.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
It's not moving like that.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
And there's nothing precedented

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
in the history of technology development

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
of this kind of self-feeding growth

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
where you go by orders of magnitude every few years.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
Now the question that I'd like to ask is,

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
if you look at these exponential curves,

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000
they don't go on forever.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
Things just can't possibly keep changing

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
as fast as they are.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000
One of two things is going to happen.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.000
Either it's going to turn into a sort of classical S-curve like this,

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.000
until something totally different comes along,

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
or maybe it's going to do this.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
That's about all it can do.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
Now I'm an optimist,

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000
so I sort of think it's probably going to do something like that.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000
If so, that means that what we're in the middle of right now

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000
is a transition.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000
We're sort of on this line

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000
in a transition from the way the world used to be

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.000
to some new way that the world is.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.000
And so what I'm trying to ask, what I've been asking myself,

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.000
is what's this new way that the world is?

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.000
What's that new state that the world is heading toward?

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.000
Because the transition seems very, very confusing

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000
when we're right in the middle of it.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000
Now when I was a kid growing up,

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000
the future was kind of the year 2000,

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:49.000
and people used to talk about what would happen in the year 2000.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000
Now here's a conference

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000
in which people talk about the future,

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.000
and you notice that the future is still at about the year 2000.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000
It's about as far as we go out.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000
So in other words, the future has kind of been shrinking

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.000
one year per year

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.000
for my whole lifetime.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000
Now I think that the reason

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000
is because we all feel

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000
that something's happening there.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000
That transition is happening. We can all sense it.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000
And we know that it just doesn't make too much sense

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000
to think out 30, 50 years

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.000
because everything's going to be so different

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000
that a simple extrapolation of what we're doing

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000
just doesn't make any sense at all.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000
So what I would like to talk about

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000
is what that could be,

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.000
what that transition could be that we're going through.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.000
Now in order to do that

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000
I'm going to have to talk about a bunch of stuff

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000
that really has nothing to do

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000
with technology and computers.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000
Because I think the only way to understand this

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000
is to really step back

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000
and take a long time scale look at things.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.000
So the time scale that I would like to look at this on

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.000
is the time scale of life on Earth.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000
So I think this picture makes sense

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.000
if you look at it a few billion years at a time.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000
So if you go back

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000
about two and a half billion years,

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.000
the Earth was this big, sterile hunk of rock

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.000
with a lot of chemicals floating around on it.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000
And if you look at the way

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000
that the chemicals got organized,

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.000
we begin to get a pretty good idea of how they do it.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.000
And I think that there's theories that are beginning to understand

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000
about how it started with RNA,

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.000
but I'm going to tell a sort of simple story of it,

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000
which is that, at that time,

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.000
there were little drops of oil floating around

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.000
with all kinds of different recipes of chemicals in them.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000
And some of those drops of oil

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000
had a particular combination of chemicals in them

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.000
which caused them to incorporate chemicals from the outside

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.000
and grow the drops of oil.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.000
And those that were like that

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000
started to split and divide.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.000
And those were the most primitive forms of cells in a sense,

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000
those little drops of oil.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.000
But now those drops of oil weren't really alive, as we say it now,

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000
because every one of them

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.000
was a little random recipe of chemicals.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000
And every time it divided,

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.000
they got sort of unequal division

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000
of the chemicals within them.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.000
And so every drop was a little bit different.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000
In fact, the drops that were different in a way

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000
that caused them to be better

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.000
at incorporating chemicals around them,

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.000
grew more and incorporated more chemicals and divided more.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000
So those tended to live longer,

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.000
get expressed more.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.000
Now that's sort of just a very simple

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000
chemical form of life,

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.000
but when things got interesting

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.000
was when these drops

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:40.000
learned a trick about abstraction.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:43.000
Somehow by ways that we don't quite understand,

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:46.000
these little drops learned to write down information.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.000
They learned to record the information

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.000
that was the recipe of the cell

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.000
onto a particular kind of chemical

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000
called DNA.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000
So in other words, they worked out,

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.000
in this mindless sort of evolutionary way,

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.000
a form of writing that let them write down what they were,

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.000
so that that way of writing it down could get copied.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:08.000
The amazing thing is that that way of writing

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.000
seems to have stayed steady

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.000
since it evolved two and a half billion years ago.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.000
In fact the recipe for us, our genes,

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.000
is exactly that same code and that same way of writing.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.000
In fact, every living creature is written

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.000
in exactly the same set of letters and the same code.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.000
In fact, one of the things that I did

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.000
just for amusement purposes

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000
is we can now write things in this code.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:35.000
And I've got here a little 100 micrograms of white powder,

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:39.000
which I try not to let the security people see at airports.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.000
(Laughter)

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.000
But this has in it --

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.000
what I did is I took this code --

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.000
the code has standard letters that we use for symbolizing it --

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:51.000
and I wrote my business card onto a piece of DNA

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:54.000
and amplified it 10 to the 22 times.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.000
So if anyone would like a hundred million copies of my business card,

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.000
I have plenty for everyone in the room,

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.000
and, in fact, everyone in the world,

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:04.000
and it's right here.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:09.000
(Laughter)

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.000
If I had really been a egotist,

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:16.000
I would have put it into a virus and released it in the room.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:21.000
(Laughter)

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000
So what was the next step?

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000
Writing down the DNA was an interesting step.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.000
And that caused these cells --

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000
that kept them happy for another billion years.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.000
But then there was another really interesting step

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:37.000
where things became completely different,

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:40.000
which is these cells started exchanging and communicating information,

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000
so that they began to get communities of cells.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.000
I don't know if you know this,

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000
but bacteria can actually exchange DNA.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.000
Now that's why, for instance,

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000
antibiotic resistance has evolved.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:53.000
Some bacteria figured out how to stay away from penicillin,

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:56.000
and it went around sort of creating its little DNA information

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.000
with other bacteria,

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:01.000
and now we have a lot of bacteria that are resistant to penicillin,

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.000
because bacteria communicate.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.000
Now what this communication allowed

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.000
was communities to form

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.000
that, in some sense, were in the same boat together;

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.000
they were synergistic.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.000
So they survived

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.000
or they failed together,

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.000
which means that if a community was very successful,

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.000
all the individuals in that community

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.000
were repeated more

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:24.000
and they were favored by evolution.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.000
Now the transition point happened

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.000
when these communities got so close

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.000
that, in fact, they got together

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:33.000
and decided to write down the whole recipe for the community

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:36.000
together on one string of DNA.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.000
And so the next stage that's interesting in life

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.000
took about another billion years.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.000
And at that stage,

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:44.000
we have multi-cellular communities,

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.000
communities of lots of different types of cells,

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.000
working together as a single organism.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:51.000
And in fact, we're such a multi-cellular community.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.000
We have lots of cells

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.000
that are not out for themselves anymore.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:58.000
Your skin cell is really useless

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.000
without a heart cell, muscle cell,

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.000
a brain cell and so on.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.000
So these communities began to evolve

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:07.000
so that the interesting level on which evolution was taking place

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.000
was no longer a cell,

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:12.000
but a community which we call an organism.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.000
Now the next step that happened

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:17.000
is within these communities.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.000
These communities of cells,

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.000
again, began to abstract information.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:24.000
And they began building very special structures

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:27.000
that did nothing but process information within the community.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.000
And those are the neural structures.

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:32.000
So neurons are the information processing apparatus

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:35.000
that those communities of cells built up.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.000
And in fact, they began to get specialists in the community

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.000
and special structures

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.000
that were responsible for recording,

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:44.000
understanding, learning information.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.000
And that was the brains and the nervous system

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.000
of those communities.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.000
And that gave them an evolutionary advantage.

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:53.000
Because at that point,

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:56.000
an individual --

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.000
learning could happen

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.000
within the time span of a single organism,

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:03.000
instead of over this evolutionary time span.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:05.000
So an organism could, for instance,

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:07.000
learn not to eat a certain kind of fruit

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:11.000
because it tasted bad and it got sick last time it ate it.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:14.000
That could happen within the lifetime of a single organism,

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:18.000
whereas before they'd built these special information processing structures,

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.000
that would have had to be learned evolutionarily

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:23.000
over hundreds of thousands of years

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:26.000
by the individuals dying off that ate that kind of fruit.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.000
So that nervous system,

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:31.000
the fact that they built these special information structures,

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:34.000
tremendously sped up the whole process of evolution.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:37.000
Because evolution could now happen within an individual.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:40.000
It could happen in learning time scales.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:42.000
But then what happened

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:44.000
was the individuals worked out,

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:46.000
of course, tricks of communicating.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.000
And for example,

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:51.000
the most sophisticated version that we're aware of is human language.

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:54.000
It's really a pretty amazing invention if you think about it.

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.000
Here I have a very complicated, messy,

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:59.000
confused idea in my head.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:02.000
I'm sitting here making grunting sounds basically,

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:05.000
and hopefully constructing a similar messy, confused idea in your head

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:07.000
that bears some analogy to it.

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:09.000
But we're taking something very complicated,

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:12.000
turning it into sound, sequences of sounds,

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:16.000
and producing something very complicated in your brain.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.000
So this allows us now

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.000
to begin to start functioning

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:23.000
as a single organism.

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:26.000
And so, in fact, what we've done

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.000
is we, humanity,

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.000
have started abstracting out.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.000
We're going through the same levels

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.000
that multi-cellular organisms have gone through --

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:37.000
abstracting out our methods of recording,

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.000
presenting, processing information.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:41.000
So for example, the invention of language

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:44.000
was a tiny step in that direction.

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:46.000
Telephony, computers,

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:49.000
videotapes, CD-ROMs and so on

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:51.000
are all our specialized mechanisms

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.000
that we've now built within our society

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.000
for handling that information.

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:58.000
And it all connects us together

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.000
into something

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.000
that is much bigger

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:04.000
and much faster

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:06.000
and able to evolve

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.000
than what we were before.

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:10.000
So now, evolution can take place

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.000
on a scale of microseconds.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.000
And you saw Ty's little evolutionary example

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.000
where he sort of did a little bit of evolution

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:19.000
on the Convolution program right before your eyes.

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:22.000
So now we've speeded up the time scales once again.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.000
So the first steps of the story that I told you about

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.000
took a billion years a piece.

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:28.000
And the next steps,

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.000
like nervous systems and brains,

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.000
took a few hundred million years.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:35.000
Then the next steps, like language and so on,

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:37.000
took less than a million years.

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:39.000
And these next steps, like electronics,

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:41.000
seem to be taking only a few decades.

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:43.000
The process is feeding on itself

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:46.000
and becoming, I guess, autocatalytic is the word for it --

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:49.000
when something reinforces its rate of change.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:52.000
The more it changes, the faster it changes.

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:55.000
And I think that that's what we're seeing here in this explosion of curve.

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:58.000
We're seeing this process feeding back on itself.

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:01.000
Now I design computers for a living,

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:03.000
and I know that the mechanisms

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:06.000
that I use to design computers

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:08.000
would be impossible

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:10.000
without recent advances in computers.

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:12.000
So right now, what I do

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:15.000
is I design objects at such complexity

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:18.000
that it's really impossible for me to design them in the traditional sense.

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:22.000
I don't know what every transistor in the connection machine does.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:24.000
There are billions of them.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.000
Instead, what I do

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:29.000
and what the designers at Thinking Machines do

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:31.000
is we think at some level of abstraction

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:33.000
and then we hand it to the machine

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:36.000
and the machine takes it beyond what we could ever do,

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:39.000
much farther and faster than we could ever do.

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:41.000
And in fact, sometimes it takes it by methods

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:44.000
that we don't quite even understand.

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.000
One method that's particularly interesting

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:49.000
that I've been using a lot lately

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:51.000
is evolution itself.

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:53.000
So what we do

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:55.000
is we put inside the machine

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:57.000
a process of evolution

00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:59.000
that takes place on the microsecond time scale.

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:01.000
So for example,

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.000
in the most extreme cases,

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:05.000
we can actually evolve a program

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:09.000
by starting out with random sequences of instructions.

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:11.000
Say, "Computer, would you please make

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:14.000
a hundred million random sequences of instructions.

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:17.000
Now would you please run all of those random sequences of instructions,

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:19.000
run all of those programs,

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:22.000
and pick out the ones that came closest to doing what I wanted."

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:24.000
So in other words, I define what I wanted.

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:26.000
Let's say I want to sort numbers,

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:28.000
as a simple example I've done it with.

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:31.000
So find the programs that come closest to sorting numbers.

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:34.000
So of course, random sequences of instructions

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:36.000
are very unlikely to sort numbers,

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:38.000
so none of them will really do it.

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:40.000
But one of them, by luck,

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:42.000
may put two numbers in the right order.

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:44.000
And I say, "Computer,

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:47.000
would you please now take the 10 percent

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:49.000
of those random sequences that did the best job.

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:51.000
Save those. Kill off the rest.

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:53.000
And now let's reproduce

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:55.000
the ones that sorted numbers the best.

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:58.000
And let's reproduce them by a process of recombination

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:00.000
analogous to sex."

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:03.000
Take two programs and they produce children

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:05.000
by exchanging their subroutines,

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:08.000
and the children inherit the traits of the subroutines of the two programs.

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:11.000
So I've got now a new generation of programs

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:13.000
that are produced by combinations

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:15.000
of the programs that did a little bit better job.

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:17.000
Say, "Please repeat that process."

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:19.000
Score them again.

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:21.000
Introduce some mutations perhaps.

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:24.000
And try that again and do that for another generation.

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:27.000
Well every one of those generations just takes a few milliseconds.

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:29.000
So I can do the equivalent

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:31.000
of millions of years of evolution on that

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:34.000
within the computer in a few minutes,

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:36.000
or in the complicated cases, in a few hours.

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:39.000
At the end of that, I end up with programs

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:41.000
that are absolutely perfect at sorting numbers.

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:44.000
In fact, they are programs that are much more efficient

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:46.000
than programs I could have ever written by hand.

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:48.000
Now if I look at those programs,

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:50.000
I can't tell you how they work.

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:52.000
I've tried looking at them and telling you how they work.

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:54.000
They're obscure, weird programs.

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:56.000
But they do the job.

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:59.000
And in fact, I know, I'm very confident that they do the job

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:01.000
because they come from a line

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:03.000
of hundreds of thousands of programs that did the job.

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:06.000
In fact, their life depended on doing the job.

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:10.000
(Laughter)

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:13.000
I was riding in a 747

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:15.000
with Marvin Minsky once,

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:18.000
and he pulls out this card and says, "Oh look. Look at this.

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:22.000
It says, 'This plane has hundreds of thousands of tiny parts

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:26.000
working together to make you a safe flight.'

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:28.000
Doesn't that make you feel confident?"

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:30.000
(Laughter)

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:33.000
In fact, we know that the engineering process doesn't work very well

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:35.000
when it gets complicated.

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:37.000
So we're beginning to depend on computers

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:41.000
to do a process that's very different than engineering.

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:44.000
And it lets us produce things of much more complexity

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:46.000
than normal engineering lets us produce.

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:49.000
And yet, we don't quite understand the options of it.

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:51.000
So in a sense, it's getting ahead of us.

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:53.000
We're now using those programs

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:55.000
to make much faster computers

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:58.000
so that we'll be able to run this process much faster.

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:01.000
So it's feeding back on itself.

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:03.000
The thing is becoming faster

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:05.000
and that's why I think it seems so confusing.

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:08.000
Because all of these technologies are feeding back on themselves.

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:10.000
We're taking off.

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:13.000
And what we are is we're at a point in time

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:15.000
which is analogous to when single-celled organisms

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:18.000
were turning into multi-celled organisms.

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:20.000
So we're the amoebas

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:23.000
and we can't quite figure out what the hell this thing is we're creating.

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:25.000
We're right at that point of transition.

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:28.000
But I think that there really is something coming along after us.

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:30.000
I think it's very haughty of us

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:33.000
to think that we're the end product of evolution.

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:35.000
And I think all of us here

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:37.000
are a part of producing

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:39.000
whatever that next thing is.

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:41.000
So lunch is coming along,

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:43.000
and I think I will stop at that point,

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:45.000
before I get selected out.

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:48.000
(Applause)
