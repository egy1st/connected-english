00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.616
It's really, really great to be here.

00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:04.536
You have the power to change the world.

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:06.216
I’m not saying that to be cliché,

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:08.560
you really have the power
to change the world.

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:11.136
Deep inside of you,
every single one of you

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.400
has the most powerful device known to man.

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:16.280
And that's an idea.

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:20.296
So a single idea, from the human mind,

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:21.856
it could start a groundswell,

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:24.656
it could be a flash point for a movement

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:27.456
and it can actually rewrite our future.

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.176
But an idea is powerless

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:32.016
if it stays inside of you.

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.096
If you never pull that idea out
for others to contend with,

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:36.320
it will die with you.

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:40.416
Now, maybe some of you guys
have tried to convey your idea

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.336
and it wasn't adopted, it was rejected,

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.216
and some other mediocre
or average idea was adopted.

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:49.576
And the only difference between those two
is in the way it was communicated.

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:52.416
Because if you communicate an idea
in a way that resonates,

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.080
change will happen,
and you can change the world.

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:58.536
In my family, we collect
these vintage European posters.

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:01.016
Every time we go to Maui,
we go to the dealer there,

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:02.856
and he turns these great big posters.

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:04.696
I love them. They all have one idea

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:07.296
and one really clear visual
that conveys the idea.

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.096
They are about the size of a mattress.
They're really big.

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:12.616
They're not as thick as a mattress,
but they're big.

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:15.176
And the guy will tell the story
as he turns the pages.

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:17.376
And this one time
I was flanked by my two kids

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.176
and he turns the page
and this poster is underneath,

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:22.056
and right when I lean forward and say,

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.736
"Oh my God, I love this poster,"

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:26.936
both of my kids jumped back
and they are like,

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:28.296
"Oh my God, mom, it's you."

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:29.536
And this is the poster.

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:30.856
(Laughter)

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:33.136
See, I'm like "Fire it up!"

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:35.696
The thing I loved
about this poster was the irony.

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:38.216
Here's this chick all fired up,
headed into battle --

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:39.496
as the standard bearer --

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:42.536
and she's holding these
little Suavitos baking spices,

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:45.416
like something so seemingly insignificant,

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:49.360
though she's willing to risk, you know,
life and limb to promote this thing.

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:53.696
So if you are to swap out
those little Suavitos baking spices

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:54.976
with a presentation --

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.336
Yeah, it's me, pretty fired up.

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.016
I was fired up about presentations

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:02.256
back when it wasn't cool
to be fired up about presentations.

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.856
I really think they have the power
to change the world

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:07.296
when you communicate
effectively through them.

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.496
And changing the world is hard.

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:12.896
It won't happen with just one person
with one single idea.

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:16.296
That idea has got to spread,
or it won't be effective.

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:18.136
So it has to come out of you

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:20.280
and out into the open for people to see.

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:25.976
And the way that ideas are conveyed
the most effectively is through story.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.616
You know, for thousands of years,

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:31.056
illiterate generations would pass on
their values and their culture

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:32.776
from generation to generation,

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:34.456
and they would stay intact.

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:37.336
So there's something kind of magical
about a story structure

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:39.536
that makes it so that when it's assembled,

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:41.816
it can be ingested and then recalled

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:43.440
by the person who's receiving it.

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:48.256
So basically a story,
you get a physical reaction;

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:51.096
your heart can race, your eyes can dilate,

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:53.736
you could talk about,
"Oh, I got a chill down my spine"

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:55.976
or, "I could feel it
in the pit of my stomach."

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.056
We actually physically react
when someone is telling us a story.

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:01.816
So even though the stage is the same,
a story can be told,

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:04.536
but once a presentation is told,
it completely flatlines.

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:06.096
And I wanted to figure out why.

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:09.496
Why is it that we physically sit
with rapt attention during a story,

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:11.280
but it just dies for a presentation.

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:15.736
So I wanted to figure out, how do you
incorporate story into presentations.

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:18.576
So we've had thousands of presentations
back at the shop --

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:20.936
hundreds of thousands
of presentations, actually,

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:23.416
so I knew the context
of a really bad presentation.

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:26.096
I decided to study cinema and literature,

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:28.496
and really dig in
and figure out what was going on

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:29.920
and why it was broken.

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:33.376
So, I want to show you
some of the findings

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:36.920
that led up to what I've uncovered
as a presentation form.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.056
So it was obvious to start with Aristotle,

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:43.056
he had a three-act structure,
a beginning, a middle and an end.

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:44.656
We studied poetics and rhetoric,

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:48.136
and a lot of presentations don't even
have that in its most simple form.

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:50.656
And then when I moved on
to studying hero archetypes,

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:52.736
I thought, "OK, the presenter is the hero,

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:55.416
they're up on the stage,
they're the star of the show."

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:58.816
It's easy to feel, as the presenter,
that you're the star of the show.

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:01.176
I realized right away,
that that's really broken.

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:04.056
Because I have an idea,
I can put it out there,

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:06.776
but if you guys don't grab that idea
and hold it as dear,

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:09.296
the idea goes nowhere
and the world is never changed.

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:11.536
So in reality,
the presenter isn't the hero,

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:14.080
the audience is the hero of our idea.

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:17.096
So if you look at
Joseph Campbell's hero's journey,

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:20.596
just in the front part, there were
some really interesting insights there.

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:23.016
So there is this likable hero
in an ordinary world,

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:24.776
and they get this call to adventure.

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:27.016
So the world is
kind of brought out of balance.

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:28.576
And at first they're resistant.

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:31.267
They're like, "I don't know
if I want to jump into this,"

00:04:31.291 --> 00:04:32.696
and then a mentor comes along

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:34.856
and helps them move
from their ordinary world

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:36.096
into a special world.

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:37.936
And that's the role of the presenter.

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:40.936
It's to be the mentor.
You're not Luke Skywalker, you're Yoda.

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:43.176
You're the one
that actually helps the audience

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:46.776
move from one thing
and into your new special idea,

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:48.324
and that's the power of a story.

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:53.096
So in its most simple structure,
it's a three-part structure of a story.

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:55.856
You have a likable hero who has a desire,

00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:57.536
they encounter a roadblock

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:02.000
and ultimately they emerge, transform,
and that's the basic structure.

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:06.056
But it wasn't until I came across
a Gustav Freytag's pyramid --

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:09.016
he drew this shape in 1863.

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:12.336
Now, he was a German dramatist ...

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:13.616
he was a German dramatist

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:16.536
and he believed
there is a five-act structure,

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:19.576
which has an exposition, a rising action,

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:22.176
a climax, a falling action
and a denouement,

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:25.336
which is the unraveling
or the resolution of the story.

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:27.456
I love this shape.
So we talk about shapes.

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:29.856
A story has an arc --
well, an arc is a shape.

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:33.080
We talk about classical music
having a shapeliness to it.

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:35.856
So I thought, hey,
if presentations had a shape,

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:37.136
what would that shape be?

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:40.216
And how did the greatest
communicators use that shape,

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:41.776
or do they use a shape?

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:44.056
So I'll never forget,
it was a Saturday morning.

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:46.936
After all this study --
it was a couple of years of study --

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:48.176
I drew a shape.

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:50.616
And I was like,
"Oh my gosh, if this shape is real,

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:53.656
I should be able to take
two completely different presentations

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:55.536
and overlay it, and it should be true."

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:56.816
So I took the obvious,

00:05:56.840 --> 00:05:59.296
I took Martin Luther King's
"I Have a Dream" speech,

00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:01.696
and I took Steve Jobs'
2007 iPhone launch speech,

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:04.056
I overlaid it over it, and it worked.

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:05.936
I sat in my office, just astounded.

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:07.816
I actually cried a little,

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:10.216
because I was like,
"I've been given this gift,"

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:11.456
and here it is,

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:13.520
this is the shape of a great presentation.

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:16.096
Isn't it amazing?

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:17.336
(Laughter)

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:18.576
I was crying.

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:21.176
I want to walk you through it,
it's pretty astounding.

00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:24.816
There is a beginning, a middle and an end,
and I want to walk you through it.

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:28.456
Because the greatest communicators --
I went through speeches, everything --

00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:29.696
I can overlay the shape.

00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:31.896
Even the Gettysburg Address
follows the shape.

00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:35.136
At the beginning of any presentation,
you need to establish what is.

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:37.816
You know, here's the status quo,
here's what's going on.

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:40.256
And then you need
to compare that to what could be.

00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:43.136
You need to make that gap
as big as possible,

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:46.616
because there is this commonplace
of the status quo,

00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:49.576
and you need to contrast that
with the loftiness of your idea.

00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:52.456
So it's like, you know,
here's the past, here's the present,

00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:53.720
but look at our future.

00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:57.056
Here's a problem,
but look at that problem removed.

00:06:57.080 --> 00:07:00.056
Here's a roadblock,
let's annihilate the roadblock.

00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:02.136
You need to really amplify that gap.

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:04.976
This would be like
the inciting incident in a movie.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.256
That's when suddenly
the audience has to contend

00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:08.856
with what you just put out there:

00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:11.776
"Wow, do I want to agree
with this and align with it or not?"

00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:14.520
And in the rest of your presentation
should support that.

00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:17.496
So the middle goes back and forth,

00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:19.736
it traverses between
what is and what could be,

00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:21.056
what is and what could be.

00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:22.696
Because what you are trying to do

00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:25.816
is make the status quo
and the normal unappealing,

00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:27.336
and you're wanting to draw them

00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:30.160
towards what could be
in the future with your idea adopted.

00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:33.616
Now, on your way to change the world,
people are going to resist.

00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:37.056
They're not going to be excited,
they may love the world the way it is.

00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:38.616
So you'll encounter resistance.

00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:40.656
That's why you
have to move back and forth.

00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:41.976
It's similar to sailing.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:45.136
When you're sailing against the wind
and there is wind resistance,

00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:48.336
you have to move your boat back and forth,
and back and forth.

00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:50.056
That's so you can capture the wind.

00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:52.096
You have to actually
capture the resistance

00:07:52.120 --> 00:07:54.056
coming against you when you're sailing.

00:07:54.080 --> 00:07:56.496
Now interesting,
if you capture the wind just right

00:07:56.520 --> 00:07:58.136
and you set your sail just right,

00:07:58.160 --> 00:08:00.856
your ship will actually
sail faster than the wind itself.

00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:02.216
It is a physics phenomenon.

00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:03.496
So by planting in there

00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:06.536
the way they're going to resist
between what is and what can be,

00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:08.816
is actually going to draw
them towards your idea

00:08:08.840 --> 00:08:10.576
quicker than should you not do that.

00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:14.056
So after you've moved back and forth
between what is and what could be,

00:08:14.080 --> 00:08:16.096
the last turning point
is a call to action,

00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:18.936
which every presentation should have,
but at the very end.

00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:21.136
You need to describe the world
as a new bliss.

00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:23.456
"This is utopia with my idea adopted."

00:08:23.480 --> 00:08:25.576
"This is the way
the world is going to look,

00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:28.096
when we join together
and we solve this big problem."

00:08:28.120 --> 00:08:29.856
You need to use that as your ending,

00:08:29.880 --> 00:08:31.920
in a very poetic and dramatic way.

00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:35.496
So, interestingly, when I was done,

00:08:35.520 --> 00:08:39.015
I was like, "You know what?
I could use this as an analysis tool."

00:08:39.039 --> 00:08:41.056
I actually transcribe speeches,

00:08:41.080 --> 00:08:44.496
and I would actually map out,
how much they map to this tool.

00:08:44.520 --> 00:08:46.473
So I want to show you some of that today,

00:08:46.497 --> 00:08:48.576
and I want to start
with the very two people

00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:50.016
that I used when I first did.

00:08:50.040 --> 00:08:52.816
Here's Mr. Jobs,
has completely changed the world.

00:08:52.840 --> 00:08:56.016
Changed the world of personal computing,
changed the music industry

00:08:56.040 --> 00:08:58.976
and now he's on his way
to change the mobile device industry.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:00.896
So he's definitely changed the world.

00:09:00.920 --> 00:09:03.896
And this is the shape
of his iPhone launch 2007,

00:09:03.920 --> 00:09:05.296
when he launched his iPhone.

00:09:05.320 --> 00:09:08.216
It's a 90-minute talk
and you can see he starts with what is,

00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:10.800
traverses back and forth
and ends with what could be.

00:09:11.800 --> 00:09:13.616
So I want to zoom in on this:

00:09:13.640 --> 00:09:16.976
the white line
is him speaking, he's talking.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.216
The next color line
you'll see popped up there,

00:09:19.240 --> 00:09:20.656
that's when he cuts to video.

00:09:20.680 --> 00:09:22.936
So he's adding some variety
and he cuts to demo.

00:09:22.960 --> 00:09:25.056
So it's not just him
talking the whole time.

00:09:25.080 --> 00:09:27.520
And these lines are representative there.

00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:30.656
And then towards the end
you'll see a blue line,

00:09:30.680 --> 00:09:32.256
which will be the guest speaker.

00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:34.416
So this is where it gets
kind of interesting:

00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:36.736
every tick mark here
is when he made them laugh.

00:09:36.760 --> 00:09:39.256
And every tick mark here
is when he made them clap.

00:09:39.280 --> 00:09:41.136
They are so involved physically,

00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:43.536
they are physically reacting
to what he is saying,

00:09:43.560 --> 00:09:44.936
which is actually fantastic,

00:09:44.960 --> 00:09:48.016
because then you know
you have the audience in your hand.

00:09:48.040 --> 00:09:51.136
So he kicks off what could be with,

00:09:51.160 --> 00:09:54.496
"This is a day I've been looking
forward to for two and a half years."

00:09:54.520 --> 00:09:55.936
So he is launching a product

00:09:55.960 --> 00:09:58.416
that he's known about already
for a couple of years.

00:09:58.440 --> 00:10:00.176
So this is not a new product to him.

00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:01.416
But look at this,

00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:03.256
he does this other thing: he marvels.

00:10:03.280 --> 00:10:04.736
He marvels at his own product.

00:10:04.760 --> 00:10:07.496
He marvels himself
more than the audience laughs or claps.

00:10:07.520 --> 00:10:11.016
So he is like, "Isn't this awesome?
Isn't this beautiful?"

00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:14.616
He is modeling for the audience
what he wants them to feel.

00:10:14.640 --> 00:10:18.680
So he is actually doing a job
of compelling them to feel a certain way.

00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:22.936
So he kicks off with what could be with,
"Every once in a while,

00:10:22.960 --> 00:10:25.896
a revolutionary product comes along
that changes everything."

00:10:25.920 --> 00:10:28.536
So he starts to kick in
and talk about his new product.

00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:31.456
Now, at the beginning of it,
he actually keeps the phone off.

00:10:31.480 --> 00:10:34.536
You'll see that the line
is pretty white up until this point,

00:10:34.560 --> 00:10:35.976
so he goes off between,

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.936
"Here's this new phone,
and here's the sucky competitors.

00:10:38.960 --> 00:10:42.176
Here's this new phone,
and here's the sucky competitors."

00:10:42.200 --> 00:10:44.976
And then, right about here,
he has the star moment --

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.096
and that something we'll always remember.

00:10:47.120 --> 00:10:48.616
He turns the phone on.

00:10:48.640 --> 00:10:50.856
The audience sees scrolling
for the first time,

00:10:50.880 --> 00:10:53.096
you can hear the oxygen
sucked out of the room.

00:10:53.120 --> 00:10:54.976
They gasped. You can actually hear it.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.456
So he creates a moment
that they'll always remember.

00:10:57.480 --> 00:10:59.976
So if we move along this model,
you can see the blue,

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.016
where the external speakers are going,

00:11:02.040 --> 00:11:04.216
and towards the bottom right,
the line breaks.

00:11:04.240 --> 00:11:05.856
That's because his clicker broke.

00:11:05.880 --> 00:11:08.376
He wants to keep
this heightened sense of excitement.

00:11:08.400 --> 00:11:09.896
He tells a personal story,

00:11:09.920 --> 00:11:12.096
right there, where
the technology didn't work.

00:11:12.120 --> 00:11:13.696
So he's the master communicator,

00:11:13.720 --> 00:11:16.160
and he turns to story
to keep the audience involved.

00:11:16.600 --> 00:11:18.976
So the top right
he ends with the new bliss.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:20.576
He leaves them with the promise

00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:24.176
that Apple will continue
to build revolutionary new products.

00:11:24.200 --> 00:11:25.400
And he says,

00:11:26.320 --> 00:11:28.576
"There's an old Wayne Gretzky
quote that I love:

00:11:28.600 --> 00:11:31.856
'I skate to where the puck is going to be,
not to where it has been.'

00:11:31.880 --> 00:11:34.856
We've always tried to do that
at Apple since the very beginning

00:11:34.880 --> 00:11:36.136
and we always will."

00:11:36.160 --> 00:11:37.616
So he ends with the new bliss.

00:11:37.640 --> 00:11:38.896
So let's look at Mr. King.

00:11:38.920 --> 00:11:41.456
He was an amazing visionary, a clergyman

00:11:41.480 --> 00:11:44.136
who spent his life
working hard for equality.

00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:46.816
And this is the shape
of the "I Have a Dream" speech.

00:11:46.840 --> 00:11:48.536
You can see he starts with what is,

00:11:48.560 --> 00:11:51.136
moves back and forth
between what is and what could be,

00:11:51.160 --> 00:11:55.296
and ends with a very poetic new bliss,
which is the famous part we all know.

00:11:55.320 --> 00:11:57.576
So I'm going to spread it out
a little bit here,

00:11:57.600 --> 00:11:59.256
stretch it for you,

00:11:59.280 --> 00:12:02.136
and what I'm doing here is
I put the actual transcript there

00:12:02.160 --> 00:12:03.376
along with the text.

00:12:03.400 --> 00:12:04.616
I know you can't read it.

00:12:04.640 --> 00:12:07.136
But at the end of every line break,
I broke the line,

00:12:07.160 --> 00:12:09.056
because he took a breath and he paused.

00:12:09.080 --> 00:12:12.416
Now he was a Southern Baptist preacher,
most people hadn't heard that,

00:12:12.440 --> 00:12:15.976
so he had a real cadence and a rhythm
that was really new for people there.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.496
So I want to cover up
these lines of text with a bar

00:12:18.520 --> 00:12:21.378
because I want to use this bar
as an information device here.

00:12:21.920 --> 00:12:24.800
So let's walk through
how he actually spoke to the people.

00:12:26.040 --> 00:12:28.256
The blue bars here
are going to be when he used

00:12:28.280 --> 00:12:30.376
the actual rhetorical device
of repetition.

00:12:30.400 --> 00:12:31.776
So he was repeating himself,

00:12:31.800 --> 00:12:33.736
he was using the same words and phrases,

00:12:33.760 --> 00:12:35.880
so people could remember and recall them.

00:12:36.640 --> 00:12:39.376
But then he also used
a lot of metaphors and visual words.

00:12:39.400 --> 00:12:41.936
This was a way to take
really complicated ideas

00:12:41.960 --> 00:12:44.936
and make them memorable
and knowledgeable, so people got it.

00:12:44.960 --> 00:12:46.456
He actually created very --

00:12:46.480 --> 00:12:48.616
almost like scenes
with his words to make it

00:12:48.640 --> 00:12:50.640
so they could envision what he was saying.

00:12:51.560 --> 00:12:55.216
And then there were also a lot of familiar
songs and scriptures that he used.

00:12:55.240 --> 00:12:57.736
This is just the front end of it
that you're seeing.

00:12:57.760 --> 00:13:00.176
And then he also made
a lot of political references

00:13:00.200 --> 00:13:02.336
of the promises
that were made to the people.

00:13:02.360 --> 00:13:04.576
So if we look at
the very first end of what is,

00:13:04.600 --> 00:13:06.976
at the very end of what is
was the very first time

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:09.616
that people actually clapped
and roared really loud.

00:13:09.640 --> 00:13:11.776
So the end of what is
what he did is he said,

00:13:11.800 --> 00:13:14.056
"America has given
the Negro people a bad check,

00:13:14.080 --> 00:13:16.696
a check which has come back
marked insufficient funds."

00:13:16.720 --> 00:13:20.016
Well, everyone knows what it's like
to not have money in your account.

00:13:20.040 --> 00:13:22.656
So he used the metaphor
people were very familiar with.

00:13:22.680 --> 00:13:24.256
But when they really charged up,

00:13:24.280 --> 00:13:26.416
the very first time
they really screamed was:

00:13:26.440 --> 00:13:28.496
"So we have come to cash this check,

00:13:28.520 --> 00:13:30.616
a check that will give us upon demand

00:13:30.640 --> 00:13:33.416
the riches of freedom
and the security of justice."

00:13:33.440 --> 00:13:35.016
That's when they really clapped.

00:13:35.040 --> 00:13:38.176
It was when he compared
what currently is to what could be.

00:13:38.200 --> 00:13:40.736
So when we move along
a little farther in the model,

00:13:40.760 --> 00:13:43.656
you'll see it goes back and forth
at a more frenzied pace.

00:13:43.680 --> 00:13:46.536
And this is when he goes
back and forth, and back and forth.

00:13:46.560 --> 00:13:48.176
Now the audience was in a frenzy.

00:13:48.200 --> 00:13:50.776
They were all excited,
and so you can actually do this

00:13:50.800 --> 00:13:53.400
to keep them in a heightened
sense of excitement.

00:13:54.080 --> 00:13:55.560
So he says, "I have a dream

00:13:56.720 --> 00:14:01.096
that one day this nation will rise up
and live out the meaning of its creed.

00:14:01.120 --> 00:14:04.816
'We hold these truths to be self-evident,
that all men are created equal.'"

00:14:04.840 --> 00:14:08.096
So he uses the little orange text there
to remind them of the promise

00:14:08.120 --> 00:14:11.296
that the politicians had made to him
or that this country had made.

00:14:11.320 --> 00:14:13.056
Then he moves back and forth between

00:14:13.080 --> 00:14:15.795
"I have a dream that one day,
I have a dream that one day,

00:14:15.819 --> 00:14:17.216
I have a dream that one day,"

00:14:17.240 --> 00:14:19.336
and at the end,
it gets really interesting.

00:14:19.360 --> 00:14:22.216
Because he uses --
you can look at the four shades of green,

00:14:22.240 --> 00:14:25.136
there's a lot of blue there,
which was a lot of repetition --

00:14:25.160 --> 00:14:27.096
he had a heightened sense of repetition.

00:14:27.120 --> 00:14:30.256
And the green was a heightened sense
of songs and scriptures.

00:14:30.280 --> 00:14:32.056
So the first batch of green

00:14:32.080 --> 00:14:34.616
was the actual scripture
from the Book of Isaiah.

00:14:34.640 --> 00:14:37.896
The second batch of green
was "My Country, 'Tis of Thee."

00:14:37.920 --> 00:14:41.216
Now, that's a familiar song
that was specifically very significant

00:14:41.240 --> 00:14:42.856
for the black people at the time,

00:14:42.880 --> 00:14:47.096
because this song was the song they
chose to change the words to as an outcry,

00:14:47.120 --> 00:14:49.080
saying that promises had not been kept.

00:14:49.720 --> 00:14:53.736
So the third batch of green was actually
a stanza from "My Country, 'Tis of Thee."

00:14:53.760 --> 00:14:55.920
And then the fourth was a Negro spiritual.

00:14:56.800 --> 00:14:59.943
"Free at last! Free at last!
Thank God Almighty, I'm free at last!"

00:14:59.967 --> 00:15:04.336
So what he did is he actually reached
inside of the hearts of the audience.

00:15:04.360 --> 00:15:06.536
He pulled from scriptures,
which is important.

00:15:06.560 --> 00:15:08.776
He pulled from songs
that they'd sung together

00:15:08.800 --> 00:15:10.456
as an outcry against this outrage,

00:15:10.480 --> 00:15:13.896
and he used those as a device
to connect and resonate with the audience.

00:15:13.920 --> 00:15:16.216
Ending -- painting a picture
of this new bliss,

00:15:16.240 --> 00:15:19.680
using the very things inside of them
that they already held as sacred.

00:15:21.080 --> 00:15:23.936
So he was a great man.
He had a big, big dream.

00:15:23.960 --> 00:15:26.896
There's a lot of people here,
you guys have really big dreams.

00:15:26.920 --> 00:15:28.856
You have really big ideas inside of you

00:15:28.880 --> 00:15:30.096
that you need to get out.

00:15:30.120 --> 00:15:32.120
But you know what? We encounter hardships.

00:15:32.144 --> 00:15:33.776
It's not easy to change the world;

00:15:33.800 --> 00:15:35.336
it's a big job.

00:15:35.360 --> 00:15:36.616
You know he was --

00:15:36.640 --> 00:15:39.376
his house was bombed,
he was stabbed with a letter opener,

00:15:39.400 --> 00:15:40.816
ultimately, he lost his life,

00:15:40.840 --> 00:15:42.656
you know, for what he cared about.

00:15:42.680 --> 00:15:46.776
But a lot of us aren't going to
be required to pay that kind of sacrifice.

00:15:46.800 --> 00:15:48.056
But what happens is

00:15:48.080 --> 00:15:51.376
that it basically is a little bit
like that basic story structure.

00:15:51.400 --> 00:15:52.776
Life can be like that.

00:15:52.800 --> 00:15:55.056
You know, you guys are all likable people,

00:15:55.080 --> 00:15:58.136
you have a desire,
you encounter roadblocks,

00:15:58.160 --> 00:15:59.536
and we stop there.

00:15:59.560 --> 00:16:01.656
We're just like, you know,
"I had this idea,

00:16:01.680 --> 00:16:03.536
but I'm not going to put it out there.

00:16:03.560 --> 00:16:04.816
It's been rejected."

00:16:04.840 --> 00:16:08.736
You know, we self-sabotage our own ideas,

00:16:08.760 --> 00:16:12.216
we just butt up against the roadblocks
and butt up against the roadblocks

00:16:12.240 --> 00:16:14.696
instead of choosing
to let the struggle transform us

00:16:14.720 --> 00:16:17.960
and choosing to go ahead
and have a dream and make it real.

00:16:18.400 --> 00:16:22.656
And you know, if anyone --
if I can do this, anybody can do this.

00:16:22.680 --> 00:16:26.376
I was raised in an economically
and emotionally starved environment.

00:16:26.400 --> 00:16:30.056
First time I got to go to a camp
with my sister, I was abused.

00:16:30.080 --> 00:16:33.296
Wasn't the first time I was abused,
it was just the most aggressive.

00:16:33.320 --> 00:16:36.056
And my mom and dad --
they married each other three times,

00:16:36.080 --> 00:16:37.296
(Audience murmurs)

00:16:37.320 --> 00:16:40.336
Yeah, that was tumultuous,
and when they weren't fighting

00:16:40.360 --> 00:16:43.456
they were helping sober up
some alcoholic that was living with us

00:16:43.480 --> 00:16:45.416
because they were both sober alcoholics.

00:16:45.440 --> 00:16:47.896
So my mom abandoned us
when I was sixteen years old.

00:16:47.920 --> 00:16:51.256
And I took on a role of caretaker
of my home and of my siblings.

00:16:51.280 --> 00:16:54.416
And I married. I met a man.

00:16:54.440 --> 00:16:56.696
Fell in love. I went to a year of college.

00:16:56.720 --> 00:16:59.406
I did what every single,
bright, young girl should do --

00:16:59.440 --> 00:17:01.656
I got married when
I was eighteen years old.

00:17:01.680 --> 00:17:02.936
And you know what?

00:17:02.960 --> 00:17:05.455
I knew, I knew

00:17:05.480 --> 00:17:07.496
that I was born for more than this.

00:17:07.520 --> 00:17:10.576
And right at the point
in the story of my life I had a choice.

00:17:10.599 --> 00:17:13.415
I could let all these things push me down

00:17:13.440 --> 00:17:15.616
and I could let all my ideas
die inside of me.

00:17:15.640 --> 00:17:18.695
I could just say, you know,
life is too hard to change the world.

00:17:18.720 --> 00:17:19.935
It's just too tough.

00:17:19.960 --> 00:17:22.040
But I chose a different story for my life.

00:17:22.839 --> 00:17:24.175
(Laughter)

00:17:24.200 --> 00:17:25.599
Don't you know it?

00:17:26.760 --> 00:17:29.096
And so I feel like
there's people in this room --

00:17:29.120 --> 00:17:31.216
you got those little
Suavitos baking spices

00:17:31.240 --> 00:17:34.016
and you're just like,
"You know, It's not that big a deal."

00:17:34.040 --> 00:17:36.256
"It's really not
the whole world I can change."

00:17:36.280 --> 00:17:38.185
But you know, you can change your world.

00:17:38.209 --> 00:17:39.416
You can change your life.

00:17:39.440 --> 00:17:41.896
You can change the world
that you have control over,

00:17:41.920 --> 00:17:43.456
you can change your sphere.

00:17:43.480 --> 00:17:45.147
I want to encourage you to do that.

00:17:45.680 --> 00:17:46.936
Because you know what?

00:17:46.960 --> 00:17:49.800
The future isn't a place
that we're going to go.

00:17:50.360 --> 00:17:53.240
It's a place that you get to create.

00:17:53.953 --> 00:17:56.096
I want to thank you.
Bless you. God bless you.

00:17:56.120 --> 00:17:57.440
(Applause)
