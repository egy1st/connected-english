00:00:01.229 --> 00:00:05.665
The digital divide is a mother
that's 45 years old and can't get a job,

00:00:05.689 --> 00:00:07.895
because she doesn't know
how to use a computer.

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:11.627
It is an immigrant that doesn't know
that he can call his family for free.

00:00:11.651 --> 00:00:14.789
It is a child who can't
resolve his homework,

00:00:14.813 --> 00:00:17.017
because he doesn't have
access to information.

00:00:17.041 --> 00:00:19.828
The digital divide is a new illiteracy.

00:00:19.852 --> 00:00:21.714
"Digital divide" is also defined as:

00:00:21.738 --> 00:00:23.798
the gap between individuals
and communities

00:00:23.822 --> 00:00:25.940
that have access
to information technologies

00:00:25.964 --> 00:00:27.117
and those that don't.

00:00:27.141 --> 00:00:29.679
Why does this happen?
It happens because of 3 things.

00:00:29.703 --> 00:00:33.147
The first is that people can't get
access to these technologies

00:00:33.171 --> 00:00:34.694
because they can't afford them.

00:00:34.718 --> 00:00:37.302
The second is because
they don't know how to use them.

00:00:37.326 --> 00:00:40.913
The third is because they don't know
the benefits derived from technology.

00:00:40.937 --> 00:00:43.357
So let's consider
some very basic statistics.

00:00:44.677 --> 00:00:48.098
The population of the world
is nearly seven billion people.

00:00:48.122 --> 00:00:51.934
Out of these, approximately two billion
are digitally included.

00:00:51.958 --> 00:00:55.450
This is approximately 30%
of the entire world population,

00:00:55.474 --> 00:00:59.197
which means that the remaining
70% of the world --

00:01:00.346 --> 00:01:02.313
close to five billion people --

00:01:02.997 --> 00:01:05.453
do not have access
to a computer or the internet.

00:01:05.477 --> 00:01:07.545
Let's think about
that number for a second.

00:01:07.569 --> 00:01:12.056
Five billion people; that's four
times the population of India,

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:15.583
that have never touched a computer,
have never accessed the internet.

00:01:15.607 --> 00:01:18.116
So this is a digital abyss
that we're talking about,

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:19.739
this is not a digital divide.

00:01:19.763 --> 00:01:21.953
Here we can see a map by Chris Harrison

00:01:21.977 --> 00:01:24.501
that shows the internet connections
around the world.

00:01:24.525 --> 00:01:27.249
What we can see is that most
of the internet connections

00:01:27.273 --> 00:01:29.272
are centered on North America and Europe,

00:01:29.296 --> 00:01:33.349
while the rest of the world is engulfed
in the dark shadow of digital divide.

00:01:33.757 --> 00:01:37.353
Next, we can see connections,
city-to-city, around the world,

00:01:37.377 --> 00:01:39.918
and we can see that most
of the information generated

00:01:39.942 --> 00:01:43.187
is being generated
between North America and Europe,

00:01:43.211 --> 00:01:46.958
while the rest of the world is not
broadcasting their ideas or information.

00:01:46.982 --> 00:01:49.213
So what does this mean?

00:01:49.237 --> 00:01:53.183
We are living in a world that seems
to be having a digital revolution,

00:01:54.347 --> 00:01:58.383
a revolution that everyone here
thinks that we're part of,

00:01:58.407 --> 00:02:02.162
but the 70% of the world that is
digitally excluded is not part of this.

00:02:02.186 --> 00:02:03.353
What does this mean?

00:02:03.377 --> 00:02:07.501
Well, the people that will be digitally
excluded won't be able to compete

00:02:07.525 --> 00:02:09.399
in the labor markets of the future,

00:02:09.423 --> 00:02:11.847
they won't be connected,
they'll be less informed,

00:02:11.871 --> 00:02:13.110
they'll be less inspired

00:02:13.134 --> 00:02:14.768
and they'll be less responsible.

00:02:14.792 --> 00:02:17.663
Internet should not be a luxury,
it should be a right,

00:02:17.687 --> 00:02:20.857
because it is a basic social necessity
of the 21st century.

00:02:21.301 --> 00:02:22.714
We can't operate without it.

00:02:22.738 --> 00:02:24.996
(Applause)

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:26.273
Thank you.

00:02:26.297 --> 00:02:29.007
It allows us to connect to the world.

00:02:29.031 --> 00:02:30.196
It empowers us.

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:33.613
It gives us social participation.
It is a tool for change.

00:02:35.571 --> 00:02:39.262
And so, how are we going
to bridge this digital divide?

00:02:39.286 --> 00:02:43.309
Well, there are many models
that try and bridge the digital divide,

00:02:43.333 --> 00:02:45.878
that try and include
the population at large.

00:02:46.348 --> 00:02:49.008
But the question is:
Are they really working?

00:02:49.764 --> 00:02:52.379
I'm sure everybody here
knows One Laptop per Child,

00:02:52.403 --> 00:02:55.388
where one computer is given to one child.

00:02:55.951 --> 00:02:57.258
The problem with this is,

00:02:57.282 --> 00:03:00.360
do we really want children
to take computers to their homes,

00:03:00.384 --> 00:03:02.550
homes that have adverse conditions?

00:03:02.574 --> 00:03:05.522
And we also must understand
that by giving a child a computer,

00:03:05.546 --> 00:03:08.181
we're also transferring costs,
very high costs,

00:03:08.205 --> 00:03:14.013
such as internet connection, electricity,
maintenance, software, updates.

00:03:14.037 --> 00:03:15.826
So we must create different models,

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:19.427
models that help the families
rather than add a burden on them.

00:03:20.816 --> 00:03:23.936
Also, let's not forget
about the carbon footprint.

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:26.230
Imagine five billion laptops.

00:03:26.254 --> 00:03:28.062
What would the world look like then?

00:03:28.086 --> 00:03:31.174
Imagine the hazardous residue
that would be generated from that.

00:03:31.198 --> 00:03:32.426
Imagine the trash.

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:36.816
So if we give one computer to one person,

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:40.743
and we multiply that times five billion,

00:03:40.767 --> 00:03:42.847
even if that laptop is a hundred dollars,

00:03:42.871 --> 00:03:46.660
then we would have 483 trillion dollars.

00:03:46.684 --> 00:03:51.827
Now let's consider we're only counting
the youth, ages 10 to 24.

00:03:51.851 --> 00:03:55.156
That's approximately 30%
of the digitally excluded population.

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:57.513
Then that would be 145 trillion dollars.

00:03:57.537 --> 00:04:00.224
What nation has this amount of money?

00:04:00.248 --> 00:04:02.311
This is not a sustainable model.

00:04:02.335 --> 00:04:04.893
So with this in mind,
we created a different model.

00:04:04.917 --> 00:04:07.576
We created the RIA, in Spanish,

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:09.933
or in English, Learning
and Innovation Network,

00:04:09.957 --> 00:04:12.172
which is a network of community centers

00:04:12.196 --> 00:04:14.613
that bring education
through the use of technology.

00:04:14.637 --> 00:04:17.930
We wanted to increase the number
of users per computer in such a way

00:04:17.954 --> 00:04:21.370
that we could dilute the cost
of infrastructure, the cost per user,

00:04:21.394 --> 00:04:23.826
and that we could bring
education and technology

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:26.065
to everybody within these communities.

00:04:26.392 --> 00:04:28.987
Let's look at a basic comparison.

00:04:29.412 --> 00:04:32.526
The RIA has 1,650 computers.

00:04:32.918 --> 00:04:35.415
If we had used
the One Laptop per Child model

00:04:35.439 --> 00:04:36.672
of a 1 to 1 ratio,

00:04:36.696 --> 00:04:40.449
then we would have benefited 1,650 users.

00:04:40.861 --> 00:04:43.503
What we did instead is set up centers

00:04:43.527 --> 00:04:46.368
that have longer hours
of operation than schools,

00:04:46.965 --> 00:04:49.430
that also include all of the population --

00:04:49.454 --> 00:04:53.070
our youngest user is 3 years old,
the oldest is 86 --

00:04:53.094 --> 00:04:59.924
and with this, in less than two years,
we were able to reach 140,000 users,

00:04:59.948 --> 00:05:01.162
out of which --

00:05:01.186 --> 00:05:02.585
(Applause)

00:05:02.609 --> 00:05:03.767
Thank you.

00:05:04.333 --> 00:05:08.312
out of which, 34,000 have already
graduated from our courses.

00:05:08.336 --> 00:05:11.606
Another thing with One Laptop per Child
is that it doesn't guarantee

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:13.294
the educational use of a computer.

00:05:13.318 --> 00:05:15.920
Technology is nothing
without that content.

00:05:15.944 --> 00:05:18.400
We need to use it
as a means, not as an end.

00:05:19.274 --> 00:05:24.026
How did we accomplish such a high impact?

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:27.287
Well, you can't just go into a community
and pretend to change it,

00:05:27.311 --> 00:05:29.110
you need to look at a lot of factors.

00:05:29.134 --> 00:05:32.067
So what we do is a thing
we call "urban acupuncture."

00:05:32.091 --> 00:05:35.792
We first start by looking
at the basic geography of a site.

00:05:35.816 --> 00:05:37.370
So take, for example, Ecatepec.

00:05:37.394 --> 00:05:42.028
This is one of the most densely
populated municipalities in Mexico.

00:05:42.052 --> 00:05:45.151
It has a very low income level.

00:05:45.175 --> 00:05:48.675
So we look at the basic geography,
we look at roads, streets,

00:05:48.699 --> 00:05:51.293
the flux of pedestrians and vehicles.

00:05:51.317 --> 00:05:53.773
Then we look at income,
we look at education.

00:05:53.797 --> 00:05:57.017
Then we set up a center there

00:05:57.041 --> 00:05:59.466
in the place that's going
to heal the body,

00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:02.438
a little needle to change the city body.

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:05.332
And there we go.

00:06:05.356 --> 00:06:08.371
And so, there are four basic elements
that we need to consider

00:06:08.395 --> 00:06:12.389
when we're using education
through technology.

00:06:12.413 --> 00:06:15.317
The first one is we need to create spaces.

00:06:15.341 --> 00:06:18.829
We need to create a space
that is welcoming to the community,

00:06:18.853 --> 00:06:24.155
a space that is according to the needs
of the children and of the elders

00:06:24.179 --> 00:06:28.229
and of every possible person
that lives within that community.

00:06:28.801 --> 00:06:32.360
So we create these spaces
that are all made with recycled materials.

00:06:32.384 --> 00:06:37.387
We use modular architecture
to lower the ecological impact.

00:06:37.804 --> 00:06:41.508
And second, connection.

00:06:41.943 --> 00:06:44.896
By connection, I mean not only
a connection to the internet,

00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:46.096
that's too easy.

00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:49.693
We need to create a connection
that's an interconnection of humans.

00:06:49.717 --> 00:06:53.695
The internet is a very complex organism

00:06:54.258 --> 00:06:58.818
that is fueled of the ideas, the thoughts
and the emotions of human beings.

00:06:58.842 --> 00:07:01.856
We need to create networks
that aid in exchanging information.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.009
Third, content.

00:07:05.033 --> 00:07:07.320
Education is nothing without content.

00:07:07.344 --> 00:07:09.607
And you can't pretend
to have a relationship

00:07:09.631 --> 00:07:11.399
of only a computer with a child.

00:07:11.423 --> 00:07:16.885
So we create a route,
a very basic learning route,

00:07:16.909 --> 00:07:18.978
where we teach people
how to use a computer,

00:07:19.002 --> 00:07:21.663
how to use the internet,
how to use office software,

00:07:21.687 --> 00:07:25.082
and in 72 hours,
we create digital citizens.

00:07:25.106 --> 00:07:28.205
You can't pretend that people
are just going to touch a computer

00:07:28.229 --> 00:07:29.677
and become digitally included,

00:07:29.701 --> 00:07:31.030
you need to have a process.

00:07:31.054 --> 00:07:34.792
And after this, then they can take on
a longer educational route.

00:07:34.816 --> 00:07:36.356
And then fourth, training.

00:07:38.209 --> 00:07:41.170
We need to train not only the users,

00:07:41.194 --> 00:07:44.171
but we need to train the people
that will facilitate learning

00:07:44.195 --> 00:07:45.377
for these people.

00:07:45.401 --> 00:07:47.674
When you're talking about
the digital divide,

00:07:47.698 --> 00:07:49.579
people have stigmas, people have fears;

00:07:49.603 --> 00:07:52.534
people don't understand how
it can complement their lives.

00:07:52.558 --> 00:07:54.278
So what we do is train facilitators

00:07:54.302 --> 00:07:57.332
so that they can help
in breaking that digital barrier.

00:07:59.483 --> 00:08:01.401
So, we have four elements:

00:08:01.425 --> 00:08:03.963
we have a space that's created,

00:08:03.987 --> 00:08:05.300
we have a connection,

00:08:05.324 --> 00:08:07.317
we have content and we have training.

00:08:07.341 --> 00:08:09.708
We have created
a digital learning community.

00:08:09.732 --> 00:08:11.696
But there is one more element,

00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:16.594
which is the benefits
that technology can create,

00:08:16.618 --> 00:08:18.714
because it is not printed, static content.

00:08:18.738 --> 00:08:21.016
It is dynamic; it is modifiable.

00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:25.614
So we have we do is, we provide
content, then we do training,

00:08:25.638 --> 00:08:29.213
then we analyze the user patterns
so that we can improve content.

00:08:29.237 --> 00:08:30.837
So it creates a virtuous circle.

00:08:30.861 --> 00:08:32.466
It allows us to deliver education

00:08:32.490 --> 00:08:34.628
according to different
types of intelligence

00:08:34.652 --> 00:08:36.966
and according to different user needs.

00:08:36.990 --> 00:08:38.161
With this in mind,

00:08:39.169 --> 00:08:44.792
we have to think that technology
is something that can modify

00:08:44.816 --> 00:08:46.450
according to human processes.

00:08:46.888 --> 00:08:48.079
I want to share a story.

00:08:48.103 --> 00:08:50.168
In 2006, I went to live here.

00:08:50.192 --> 00:08:54.130
This is one of the poorest
communities in all of Mexico.

00:08:54.154 --> 00:08:57.264
I went to film a documentary
on the people that live off trash,

00:08:57.288 --> 00:08:59.921
entirely of trash -- their houses
are built with trash,

00:08:59.945 --> 00:09:01.752
they eat trash, they dress in trash.

00:09:01.776 --> 00:09:03.823
And after two months of living with them,

00:09:03.847 --> 00:09:06.029
of seeing the children
and the way they work,

00:09:06.053 --> 00:09:09.095
I understood that the only thing
that can change

00:09:09.119 --> 00:09:12.522
and that can break the poverty
cycle is education.

00:09:12.546 --> 00:09:15.698
And we can use technology
to bring education to these communities.

00:09:17.378 --> 00:09:19.192
Here is another shot.

00:09:19.216 --> 00:09:25.673
The main message is that technology
is not going to save the world;

00:09:25.697 --> 00:09:28.580
we are, and we can use
technology to help us.

00:09:29.692 --> 00:09:32.278
I'm sure everybody here
has experienced it;

00:09:32.302 --> 00:09:34.353
what moves technology is human energy.

00:09:34.377 --> 00:09:37.714
So let's use this energy
to make the world a better place.

00:09:37.738 --> 00:09:38.897
Thank you.

00:09:38.921 --> 00:09:41.111
