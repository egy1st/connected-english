00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
When we park in a big parking lot,

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
how do we remember where we parked our car?

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Here's the problem facing Homer.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
And we're going to try to understand

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
what's happening in his brain.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
So we'll start with the hippocampus, shown in yellow,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
which is the organ of memory.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
If you have damage there, like in Alzheimer's,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
you can't remember things including where you parked your car.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
It's named after Latin for "seahorse,"

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
which it resembles.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
And like the rest of the brain, it's made of neurons.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
So the human brain

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
has about a hundred billion neurons in it.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
And the neurons communicate with each other

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
by sending little pulses or spikes of electricity

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
via connections to each other.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
The hippocampus is formed of two sheets of cells,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
which are very densely interconnected.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
And scientists have begun to understand

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
how spatial memory works

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
by recording from individual neurons

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
in rats or mice

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
while they forage or explore an environment

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
looking for food.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
So we're going to imagine we're recording from a single neuron

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
in the hippocampus of this rat here.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
And when it fires a little spike of electricity,

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
there's going to be a red dot and a click.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
So what we see

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
is that this neuron knows

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
whenever the rat has gone into one particular place in its environment.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
And it signals to the rest of the brain

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
by sending a little electrical spike.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
So we could show the firing rate of that neuron

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
as a function of the animal's location.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
And if we record from lots of different neurons,

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
we'll see that different neurons fire

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
when the animal goes in different parts of its environment,

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
like in this square box shown here.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
So together they form a map

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
for the rest of the brain,

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
telling the brain continually,

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
"Where am I now within my environment?"

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
Place cells are also being recorded in humans.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
So epilepsy patients sometimes need

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
the electrical activity in their brain monitoring.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
And some of these patients played a video game

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
where they drive around a small town.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000
And place cells in their hippocampi would fire, become active,

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
start sending electrical impulses

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
whenever they drove through a particular location in that town.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
So how does a place cell know

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
where the rat or person is within its environment?

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
Well these two cells here

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
show us that the boundaries of the environment

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
are particularly important.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
So the one on the top

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
likes to fire sort of midway between the walls

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
of the box that their rat's in.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
And when you expand the box, the firing location expands.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
The one below likes to fire

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000
whenever there's a wall close by to the south.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
And if you put another wall inside the box,

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
then the cell fires in both place

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
wherever there's a wall to the south

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
as the animal explores around in its box.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
So this predicts

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
that sensing the distances and directions of boundaries around you --

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
extended buildings and so on --

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
is particularly important for the hippocampus.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
And indeed, on the inputs to the hippocampus,

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
cells are found which project into the hippocampus,

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
which do respond exactly

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
to detecting boundaries or edges

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
at particular distances and directions

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
from the rat or mouse

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
as it's exploring around.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
So the cell on the left, you can see,

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
it fires whenever the animal gets near

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000
to a wall or a boundary to the east,

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000
whether it's the edge or the wall of a square box

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
or the circular wall of the circular box

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000
or even the drop at the edge of a table, which the animals are running around.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
And the cell on the right there

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
fires whenever there's a boundary to the south,

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000
whether it's the drop at the edge of the table or a wall

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000
or even the gap between two tables that are pulled apart.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000
So that's one way in which we think

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.000
place cells determine where the animal is as it's exploring around.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.000
We can also test where we think objects are,

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.000
like this goal flag, in simple environments --

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000
or indeed, where your car would be.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.000
So we can have people explore an environment

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.000
and see the location they have to remember.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000
And then, if we put them back in the environment,

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000
generally they're quite good at putting a marker down

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000
where they thought that flag or their car was.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000
But on some trials,

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000
we could change the shape and size of the environment

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000
like we did with the place cell.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000
In that case, we can see

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.000
how where they think the flag had been changes

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000
as a function of how you change the shape and size of the environment.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000
And what you see, for example,

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000
if the flag was where that cross was in a small square environment,

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000
and then if you ask people where it was,

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000
but you've made the environment bigger,

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000
where they think the flag had been

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000
stretches out in exactly the same way

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000
that the place cell firing stretched out.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000
It's as if you remember where the flag was

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.000
by storing the pattern of firing across all of your place cells

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000
at that location,

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.000
and then you can get back to that location

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000
by moving around

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000
so that you best match the current pattern of firing of your place cells

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000
with that stored pattern.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.000
That guides you back to the location that you want to remember.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.000
But we also know where we are through movement.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000
So if we take some outbound path --

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000
perhaps we park and we wander off --

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000
we know because our own movements,

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000
which we can integrate over this path

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000
roughly what the heading direction is to go back.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:51.000
And place cells also get this kind of path integration input

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000
from a kind of cell called a grid cell.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000
Now grid cells are found, again,

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000
on the inputs to the hippocampus,

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000
and they're a bit like place cells.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000
But now as the rat explores around,

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000
each individual cell fires

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.000
in a whole array of different locations

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000
which are laid out across the environment

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.000
in an amazingly regular triangular grid.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.000
And if you record from several grid cells --

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000
shown here in different colors --

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.000
each one has a grid-like firing pattern across the environment,

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.000
and each cell's grid-like firing pattern is shifted slightly

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000
relative to the other cells.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000
So the red one fires on this grid

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.000
and the green one on this one and the blue on on this one.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.000
So together, it's as if the rat

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000
can put a virtual grid of firing locations

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000
across its environment --

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.000
a bit like the latitude and longitude lines that you'd find on a map,

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.000
but using triangles.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000
And as it moves around,

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.000
the electrical activity can pass

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000
from one of these cells to the next cell

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000
to keep track of where it is,

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.000
so that it can use its own movements

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000
to know where it is in its environment.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000
Do people have grid cells?

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000
Well because all of the grid-like firing patterns

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000
have the same axes of symmetry,

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.000
the same orientations of grid, shown in orange here,

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000
it means that the net activity

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.000
of all of the grid cells in a particular part of the brain

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000
should change

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000
according to whether we're running along these six directions

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.000
or running along one of the six directions in between.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.000
So we can put people in an MRI scanner

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.000
and have them do a little video game

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.000
like the one I showed you

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.000
and look for this signal.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:28.000
And indeed, you do see it in the human entorhinal cortex,

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.000
which is the same part of the brain that you see grid cells in rats.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.000
So back to Homer.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.000
He's probably remembering where his car was

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.000
in terms of the distances and directions

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000
to extended buildings and boundaries

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.000
around the location where he parked.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.000
And that would be represented

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.000
by the firing of boundary-detecting cells.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.000
He's also remembering the path he took out of the car park,

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.000
which would be represented in the firing of grid cells.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000
Now both of these kinds of cells

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000
can make the place cells fire.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.000
And he can return to the location where he parked

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.000
by moving so as to find where it is

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000
that best matches the firing pattern

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000
of the place cells in his brain currently

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:07.000
with the stored pattern where he parked his car.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000
And that guides him back to that location

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000
irrespective of visual cues

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.000
like whether his car's actually there.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000
Maybe it's been towed.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.000
But he knows where it was, so he knows to go and get it.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.000
So beyond spatial memory,

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.000
if we look for this grid-like firing pattern

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.000
throughout the whole brain,

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.000
we see it in a whole series of locations

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000
which are always active

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000
when we do all kinds of autobiographical memory tasks,

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:34.000
like remembering the last time you went to a wedding, for example.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000
So it may be that the neural mechanisms

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.000
for representing the space around us

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:43.000
are also used for generating visual imagery

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:46.000
so that we can recreate the spatial scene, at least,

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:49.000
of the events that have happened to us when we want to imagine them.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.000
So if this was happening,

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:54.000
your memories could start by place cells activating each other

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.000
via these dense interconnections

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.000
and then reactivating boundary cells

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000
to create the spatial structure

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000
of the scene around your viewpoint.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000
And grid cells could move this viewpoint through that space.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.000
Another kind of cell, head direction cells,

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.000
which I didn't mention yet,

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:11.000
they fire like a compass according to which way you're facing.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.000
They could define the viewing direction

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:16.000
from which you want to generate an image for your visual imagery,

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:19.000
so you can imagine what happened when you were at this wedding, for example.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.000
So this is just one example

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.000
of a new era really

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.000
in cognitive neuroscience

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.000
where we're beginning to understand

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.000
psychological processes

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:32.000
like how you remember or imagine or even think

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.000
in terms of the actions

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:37.000
of the billions of individual neurons that make up our brains.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.000
Thank you very much.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.000
(Applause)
