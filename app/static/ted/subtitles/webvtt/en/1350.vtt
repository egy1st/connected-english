00:00:00.365 --> 00:00:02.372
What I want to talk to you about today

00:00:02.396 --> 00:00:06.976
is some of the problems that the military
of the Western world --

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.737
Australia, United States,
the UK and so on --

00:00:09.761 --> 00:00:12.891
face in some of the deployments
that they're dealing with

00:00:12.915 --> 00:00:14.819
in the modern world at this time.

00:00:14.843 --> 00:00:16.667
If you think about the sorts of things

00:00:16.691 --> 00:00:19.788
we've sent Australian military
personnel to in recent years,

00:00:19.812 --> 00:00:22.205
we've got obvious things
like Iraq and Afghanistan,

00:00:22.229 --> 00:00:25.397
but you've also got things like
East Timor and the Solomon Islands,

00:00:25.421 --> 00:00:26.574
and so on.

00:00:26.598 --> 00:00:28.034
And a lot of these deployments

00:00:28.058 --> 00:00:31.192
that we're sending
military personnel to these days

00:00:31.216 --> 00:00:32.895
aren't traditional wars.

00:00:33.353 --> 00:00:37.440
In fact, a lot of the jobs
we're asking military personnel to do

00:00:37.464 --> 00:00:38.615
in those situations

00:00:38.639 --> 00:00:42.215
are ones that, in their own countries --
Australia, the US and so on --

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.608
would actually be done by police officers.

00:00:44.632 --> 00:00:46.660
So there's a bunch
of problems that come up

00:00:46.684 --> 00:00:48.692
for military personnel
in these situations,

00:00:48.716 --> 00:00:51.967
because they're doing things
they haven't really been trained for.

00:00:51.991 --> 00:00:56.803
And they're doing things that those
who do them in their own countries

00:00:56.827 --> 00:01:00.482
are trained very differently for
and equipped very differently for.

00:01:00.506 --> 00:01:04.169
Now, there's a bunch of reasons
why we send military personnel,

00:01:04.193 --> 00:01:06.026
rather than police, to do these jobs.

00:01:06.415 --> 00:01:08.976
If Australia had to send
1,000 people tomorrow

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.775
to West Papua, for example,

00:01:11.799 --> 00:01:15.626
we don't have 1,000 police officers
hanging around that could go tomorrow,

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:17.808
and we do have
1,000 soldiers that could go.

00:01:18.251 --> 00:01:20.911
So when we have to send someone,
we send the military --

00:01:20.935 --> 00:01:22.512
they're there, they're available,

00:01:22.536 --> 00:01:25.269
and heck, they're used to going off
and doing these things

00:01:25.293 --> 00:01:26.536
and living by themselves

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:28.398
and not having all this extra support.

00:01:28.422 --> 00:01:31.082
So they are able to do it in that sense.

00:01:31.106 --> 00:01:33.936
But they aren't trained
the same way police officers are,

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.956
and they're certainly not equipped
the way police officers are,

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:39.172
so this has raised
a bunch of problems for them

00:01:39.196 --> 00:01:40.682
when dealing with these issues.

00:01:40.706 --> 00:01:44.064
One particular thing that's come up
that I am especially interested in,

00:01:44.088 --> 00:01:45.715
is the question of whether,

00:01:45.739 --> 00:01:48.779
when we're sending military personnel
to do these sorts of jobs,

00:01:48.803 --> 00:01:50.833
we ought to be equipping them differently;

00:01:50.857 --> 00:01:53.722
and in particular, whether we ought
to be giving them access

00:01:53.746 --> 00:01:56.162
to some of the nonlethal weapons
that police have.

00:01:56.186 --> 00:01:58.265
Since they're doing some of the same jobs,

00:01:58.289 --> 00:02:00.347
maybe they should have
some of those things.

00:02:00.371 --> 00:02:04.070
And there's a range of places you'd think
those things would be really useful.

00:02:04.094 --> 00:02:06.677
For example, when you've got
military checkpoints.

00:02:06.701 --> 00:02:08.716
If people are approaching
these checkpoints

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:12.365
and the military personnel are unsure
if this person's hostile or not,

00:02:12.389 --> 00:02:14.743
say this person approaching
here, and they say,

00:02:14.767 --> 00:02:16.363
"Is this a suicide bomber or not?

00:02:16.387 --> 00:02:18.353
Is something hidden under their clothes?

00:02:18.377 --> 00:02:19.531
What's going to happen?"

00:02:19.555 --> 00:02:21.807
They don't know if the person
is hostile or not.

00:02:21.831 --> 00:02:25.218
If the person doesn't follow directions,
they may end up shooting them,

00:02:25.242 --> 00:02:28.457
and then find out afterwards
either, yes, we shot the right person,

00:02:28.481 --> 00:02:30.426
or, no, this was just an innocent person

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:32.582
who didn't understand what was going on.

00:02:32.606 --> 00:02:35.212
So if they had nonlethal weapons,
then they would say,

00:02:35.236 --> 00:02:37.263
"We can use them
in that sort of situation.

00:02:37.287 --> 00:02:39.175
If we shoot someone who wasn't hostile,

00:02:39.199 --> 00:02:41.048
at least we haven't killed them."

00:02:41.072 --> 00:02:44.327
Another situation: this photo
is from one of the missions

00:02:44.351 --> 00:02:46.144
in the Balkans in the late 1990s.

00:02:46.765 --> 00:02:48.742
This situation is a little bit different,

00:02:48.766 --> 00:02:50.727
where maybe they know someone is hostile;

00:02:50.751 --> 00:02:52.469
they've got someone shooting at them

00:02:52.493 --> 00:02:54.690
or doing something else
that's clearly hostile,

00:02:54.714 --> 00:02:55.946
throwing rocks, whatever.

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:57.121
But if they respond,

00:02:57.145 --> 00:03:00.138
there's a range of other people around
who are innocent people,

00:03:00.162 --> 00:03:01.317
who might also get hurt.

00:03:01.341 --> 00:03:02.568
It'd be collateral damage

00:03:02.592 --> 00:03:05.309
that the military
often doesn't want to talk about.

00:03:05.333 --> 00:03:08.092
So again, they'd say, "With access
to nonlethal weapons,

00:03:08.116 --> 00:03:10.049
if we've got someone we know is hostile,

00:03:10.073 --> 00:03:11.906
we can do something to deal with them,

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:13.692
and know that if we hit anyone else,

00:03:13.716 --> 00:03:15.667
at least we're not going to kill them."

00:03:16.091 --> 00:03:17.527
Another suggestion has been,

00:03:17.551 --> 00:03:19.838
since we're putting so many
robots in the field,

00:03:19.862 --> 00:03:21.132
we can see the time coming

00:03:21.156 --> 00:03:24.024
where they're actually going
to send robots out in the field

00:03:24.048 --> 00:03:25.202
that are autonomous.

00:03:25.226 --> 00:03:28.705
They'll make their own decisions
about who to shoot and who not to shoot,

00:03:28.729 --> 00:03:30.071
without a human in the loop.

00:03:30.095 --> 00:03:31.407
So the suggestion is,

00:03:31.431 --> 00:03:34.545
if we're going to send robots out
and allow them to do this,

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:38.827
maybe it would be a good idea
if they were armed with nonlethal weapons,

00:03:38.851 --> 00:03:41.964
so if the robot makes a bad decision
and shoots the wrong person,

00:03:41.988 --> 00:03:44.066
again, they haven't actually killed them.

00:03:44.632 --> 00:03:47.848
Now, there's a whole range
of different sorts of nonlethal weapons,

00:03:47.872 --> 00:03:49.473
some of which are available now,

00:03:49.497 --> 00:03:51.089
some of which they're developing.

00:03:51.113 --> 00:03:53.391
You've got traditional things
like pepper spray,

00:03:53.415 --> 00:03:54.896
OC spray up at the top there,

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:56.774
or Tasers over here.

00:03:56.798 --> 00:03:59.950
The one on the top right here
is actually a dazzling laser,

00:03:59.974 --> 00:04:02.589
intended to just blind
the person momentarily

00:04:02.613 --> 00:04:04.223
and disorient them.

00:04:04.247 --> 00:04:06.239
You've got nonlethal shotgun rounds

00:04:06.263 --> 00:04:09.682
that contain rubber pellets
instead of the traditional metal ones.

00:04:09.706 --> 00:04:12.289
And this one in the middle
here, the large truck,

00:04:12.313 --> 00:04:14.683
is called the Active Denial System,

00:04:14.707 --> 00:04:17.327
something the US military
is working on at the moment.

00:04:17.351 --> 00:04:20.327
It's essentially a big
microwave transmitter.

00:04:20.794 --> 00:04:23.145
It's sort of your classic
idea of a heat ray.

00:04:23.947 --> 00:04:26.576
It goes out to a really long distance,

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:28.839
compared to any of these
other sorts of things.

00:04:28.863 --> 00:04:32.689
Anybody who is hit with this
feels a sudden burst of heat,

00:04:32.713 --> 00:04:34.824
and just wants to get out of the way.

00:04:34.848 --> 00:04:37.472
It is a lot more sophisticated
than a microwave oven,

00:04:37.496 --> 00:04:40.378
but it basically is boiling
the water molecules

00:04:40.402 --> 00:04:42.354
in the very surface level of your skin.

00:04:42.378 --> 00:04:44.124
So you feel this massive heat,

00:04:44.148 --> 00:04:46.560
and you go, "I want
to get out of the way."

00:04:46.584 --> 00:04:48.564
And they think this will be really useful

00:04:48.588 --> 00:04:51.733
in places where we need to clear
a crowd out of a particular area,

00:04:51.757 --> 00:04:53.206
if the crowd is being hostile.

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:55.841
If we need to keep people
away from a particular place,

00:04:55.865 --> 00:04:57.911
we can do that with these sorts of things.

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:01.397
So there's a whole range
of different nonlethal weapons

00:05:01.421 --> 00:05:03.361
we could give military personnel,

00:05:03.385 --> 00:05:05.292
and there's a whole range of situations

00:05:05.316 --> 00:05:07.269
where they're looking at them and saying,

00:05:07.293 --> 00:05:09.128
"These things would be really useful."

00:05:09.152 --> 00:05:10.556
But as I said,

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:13.569
the military and the police
are very different.

00:05:13.593 --> 00:05:14.625
(Laughter)

00:05:14.649 --> 00:05:17.380
Yes, you don't have to look
very hard at this to recognize

00:05:17.404 --> 00:05:19.172
that they might be very different.

00:05:19.196 --> 00:05:20.466
In particular,

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:22.170
the attitude to the use of force

00:05:22.194 --> 00:05:24.262
and the way they're trained to use force

00:05:24.286 --> 00:05:25.866
is especially different.

00:05:26.976 --> 00:05:28.576
The police --

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:31.612
and knowing because I've actually
helped to train police --

00:05:31.636 --> 00:05:34.374
police, particularly
in Western jurisdictions at least,

00:05:34.398 --> 00:05:38.241
are trained to De-escalate force,

00:05:38.265 --> 00:05:41.210
to try and avoid using force
wherever possible,

00:05:41.234 --> 00:05:45.698
and to use lethal force
only as an absolute last resort.

00:05:46.441 --> 00:05:49.017
Military personnel
are being trained for war.

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:52.687
So they're trained that,
as soon as things go bad,

00:05:52.711 --> 00:05:55.231
their first response is lethal force.

00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:59.468
The moment the fecal matter
hits the rotating turbine --

00:05:59.492 --> 00:06:00.524
(Laughter)

00:06:00.548 --> 00:06:02.769
you can start shooting at people.

00:06:03.753 --> 00:06:05.576
So their attitudes

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:07.993
to the use of lethal force
are very different,

00:06:08.017 --> 00:06:09.636
and I think it's fairly obvious

00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:12.576
that their attitude to the use
of nonlethal weapons

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:15.695
would also be very different
from what it is with the police.

00:06:16.177 --> 00:06:18.278
And since we've already had
so many problems

00:06:18.302 --> 00:06:20.923
with police use of nonlethal
weapons in various ways,

00:06:20.947 --> 00:06:24.025
I thought it would be a good idea
to look at some of those things

00:06:24.049 --> 00:06:25.870
and relate it to the military context.

00:06:25.894 --> 00:06:29.576
I was very surprised when I started
to do this to see that, in fact,

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:33.231
even the people who advocated the use
of nonlethal weapons by the military

00:06:33.255 --> 00:06:34.576
hadn't actually done that.

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:36.129
They generally seemed to think,

00:06:36.153 --> 00:06:38.705
"Why would we care
what's happened with the police?

00:06:38.729 --> 00:06:40.551
We're looking at something different,"

00:06:40.575 --> 00:06:41.987
and didn't seem to recognize

00:06:42.011 --> 00:06:44.458
they were looking at pretty
much the same stuff.

00:06:44.482 --> 00:06:47.266
So I started to investigate
some of those issues,

00:06:47.290 --> 00:06:51.043
and have a look at the way
police use nonlethal weapons

00:06:51.067 --> 00:06:52.225
when they're introduced,

00:06:52.249 --> 00:06:55.576
and some of the problems that might
arise out of those sorts of things

00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:57.627
when they actually do introduce them.

00:06:57.651 --> 00:07:00.210
And of course, being Australian,

00:07:00.234 --> 00:07:04.002
I started looking at stuff in Australia,
knowing from my own experience

00:07:04.026 --> 00:07:07.842
of various times when nonlethal weapons
have been introduced in Australia.

00:07:07.866 --> 00:07:11.332
One of the things I particularly
looked at was the use of OC spray --

00:07:11.356 --> 00:07:13.869
oleoresin capsicum spray, pepper spray --

00:07:13.893 --> 00:07:15.825
by Australian police,

00:07:15.849 --> 00:07:18.660
and seeing what had happened
when that had been introduced,

00:07:18.684 --> 00:07:20.163
and those sorts of issues.

00:07:20.187 --> 00:07:23.293
And one study that I found,
a particularly interesting one,

00:07:23.317 --> 00:07:25.214
was in Queensland,

00:07:25.238 --> 00:07:28.663
because they had a trial period
for the use of pepper spray

00:07:28.687 --> 00:07:31.137
before they actually
introduced it more broadly.

00:07:31.732 --> 00:07:34.581
And I went and had a look
at some of the figures here.

00:07:34.605 --> 00:07:37.112
Now, when they introduced
OC spray in Queensland,

00:07:37.136 --> 00:07:38.708
they were really explicit.

00:07:38.732 --> 00:07:42.228
The police minister's and a heap
of public statements were made about it.

00:07:42.252 --> 00:07:45.645
They were saying, "This is explicitly
intended to give police an option

00:07:45.669 --> 00:07:47.788
between shouting and shooting.

00:07:48.858 --> 00:07:51.576
This is something they can use
instead of a firearm

00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:54.869
in situations where they would have
previously had to shoot someone."

00:07:54.893 --> 00:07:57.576
So I looked at all
of the police shooting figures.

00:07:57.600 --> 00:07:59.696
And you can't actually
find them very easily

00:07:59.720 --> 00:08:01.576
for individual Australian states;

00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:03.116
I could only find these.

00:08:03.140 --> 00:08:05.939
This is from an Australian Institute
of Criminology report.

00:08:05.963 --> 00:08:07.971
You can see, in the fine print at the top:

00:08:07.995 --> 00:08:11.220
"Police shooting deaths"
means not just people shot by police,

00:08:11.244 --> 00:08:14.274
but people who have shot themselves
in the presence of police.

00:08:14.298 --> 00:08:16.749
But these are the figures
across the entire country,

00:08:16.773 --> 00:08:19.877
and the red arrow represents
the point where Queensland said,

00:08:19.901 --> 00:08:21.795
"Yes, this is where we're going to give

00:08:21.819 --> 00:08:23.959
all police officers
across the entire state

00:08:23.983 --> 00:08:25.486
access to OC spray."

00:08:25.510 --> 00:08:28.576
So you can see there were six deaths
sort of leading up to it,

00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:30.671
every year for a number of years.

00:08:30.695 --> 00:08:32.576
There was a spike a few years before,

00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:34.442
but that wasn't actually Queensland.

00:08:34.466 --> 00:08:36.097
Anyone know where that was?

00:08:36.121 --> 00:08:37.742
Wasn't Port Arthur, no.

00:08:37.766 --> 00:08:39.844
Victoria? Yes, correct.

00:08:39.868 --> 00:08:41.845
That spike was all Victoria.

00:08:41.869 --> 00:08:43.020
(Laughter)

00:08:43.044 --> 00:08:45.608
So it wasn't that Queensland
had a particular problem

00:08:45.632 --> 00:08:48.327
with deaths from police
shootings and so on.

00:08:48.351 --> 00:08:50.764
So, six shootings
across the whole country,

00:08:50.788 --> 00:08:52.825
fairly consistently over the years before.

00:08:52.849 --> 00:08:55.801
The next two years were the years
they studied -- 2001, 2002.

00:08:55.825 --> 00:08:58.737
Anyone want to take a stab
at the number of times,

00:08:58.761 --> 00:09:00.417
given how they've introduced this,

00:09:00.441 --> 00:09:03.909
the number of times police in Queensland
used OC spray in that period?

00:09:03.933 --> 00:09:06.039
Hundreds? One? Three?

00:09:06.425 --> 00:09:07.944
A thousand is getting better.

00:09:10.471 --> 00:09:14.457
Explicitly introduced as an alternative
to the use of lethal force --

00:09:14.481 --> 00:09:17.195
an alternative between
shouting and shooting.

00:09:17.219 --> 00:09:19.196
I'm going to go out on a limb here

00:09:19.220 --> 00:09:22.508
and say that if Queensland police
didn't have OC spray,

00:09:22.532 --> 00:09:25.313
they wouldn't have shot 2,226 people

00:09:25.337 --> 00:09:26.708
in those two years.

00:09:26.732 --> 00:09:27.931
(Laughter)

00:09:29.222 --> 00:09:32.421
In fact, if you have a look
at the studies they were looking at,

00:09:32.445 --> 00:09:35.727
the material they were
collecting and examining,

00:09:35.751 --> 00:09:40.363
you can see the suspects were only armed
in about 15 percent of cases

00:09:40.387 --> 00:09:41.964
where OC spray was used.

00:09:42.819 --> 00:09:45.457
It was routinely being
used in this period,

00:09:45.481 --> 00:09:47.600
and, of course, still is routinely used --

00:09:47.624 --> 00:09:50.006
because there were no complaints about it,

00:09:50.030 --> 00:09:53.128
not within the context
of this study, anyway --

00:09:53.152 --> 00:09:56.964
it was routinely being used
to deal with people who were violent,

00:09:56.988 --> 00:09:58.691
who were potentially violent,

00:09:58.715 --> 00:10:01.032
and also quite frequently used

00:10:01.056 --> 00:10:04.207
to deal with people who were
simply passively noncompliant.

00:10:06.222 --> 00:10:08.307
This person is not doing anything violent,

00:10:08.331 --> 00:10:10.416
but they just won't do
what we want them to.

00:10:10.440 --> 00:10:12.953
They're not obeying
the directions we're giving them,

00:10:12.977 --> 00:10:16.129
so we'll give them a shot
of the OC spray -- that'll speed them up.

00:10:16.153 --> 00:10:18.222
Everything will work out better that way.

00:10:18.704 --> 00:10:21.108
This was something explicitly introduced

00:10:21.132 --> 00:10:22.964
to be an alternative to firearms,

00:10:22.988 --> 00:10:24.965
but it's being routinely used

00:10:24.989 --> 00:10:27.973
to deal with a whole range
of other sorts of problems.

00:10:28.466 --> 00:10:30.790
Now one of the particular
issues that comes up

00:10:30.814 --> 00:10:33.576
with military use of nonlethal weapons --

00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:36.519
and people actually say,
"There might be some problems" --

00:10:36.543 --> 00:10:39.576
there's a couple of particular
problems that get focused on.

00:10:39.961 --> 00:10:45.112
One of those problems is: nonlethal
weapons may be used indiscriminately.

00:10:45.136 --> 00:10:48.357
One of the fundamental principles
of military use of force

00:10:48.381 --> 00:10:50.149
is that you have to be discriminate;

00:10:50.173 --> 00:10:52.926
you have to be careful
about who you're shooting at.

00:10:52.950 --> 00:10:55.576
So one of the problems suggested
with nonlethal weapons

00:10:55.600 --> 00:10:57.791
is that they might be used
indiscriminately --

00:10:57.815 --> 00:11:00.451
that you would use them
against a whole range of people,

00:11:00.475 --> 00:11:02.780
because you don't have
to worry so much anymore.

00:11:02.804 --> 00:11:06.415
And in fact, one particular instance
where I think that actually happens

00:11:06.439 --> 00:11:09.297
was the Dubrovka Theater
siege in Moscow in 2002,

00:11:09.321 --> 00:11:12.336
which probably a lot of you,
unlike most of my students at ADFA,

00:11:12.360 --> 00:11:13.953
are old enough to remember.

00:11:13.977 --> 00:11:16.738
So, Chechens had come in
and taken control of the theater.

00:11:16.762 --> 00:11:20.070
They were holding something
like 700 people hostage.

00:11:20.094 --> 00:11:21.724
They'd released a bunch of people,

00:11:21.748 --> 00:11:24.114
but they still had
about 700 people hostage.

00:11:24.138 --> 00:11:29.576
And the Russian military police
special forces, "Spetsnaz,"

00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:31.576
came in and stormed the theater.

00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:35.043
The way they did it was to pump
the whole thing full of anesthetic gas.

00:11:35.067 --> 00:11:39.669
And it turned out
that lots of the hostages died

00:11:39.693 --> 00:11:41.608
as a result of inhaling the gas.

00:11:42.481 --> 00:11:44.576
It was used indiscriminately.

00:11:44.600 --> 00:11:46.997
They pumped the whole theater
full of the gas.

00:11:47.489 --> 00:11:50.179
And it's no surprise that people died,

00:11:50.203 --> 00:11:53.576
because you don't know how much gas
each person is going to inhale,

00:11:53.600 --> 00:11:57.495
what position they'll fall in when
they become unconscious, and so on.

00:11:57.519 --> 00:12:00.576
There were, in fact,
only a couple of people who got shot

00:12:00.600 --> 00:12:02.044
in this episode.

00:12:02.600 --> 00:12:04.576
So when they had a look at it afterward,

00:12:04.600 --> 00:12:07.542
there were only a couple of people
who'd apparently been shot,

00:12:07.566 --> 00:12:10.442
by the hostage takers
or by the police forces

00:12:10.466 --> 00:12:12.472
trying to deal with the situation.

00:12:12.496 --> 00:12:14.203
Virtually everybody that got killed

00:12:14.227 --> 00:12:16.648
got killed from inhaling the gas.

00:12:17.123 --> 00:12:20.451
The final toll of hostages
is a little unclear,

00:12:20.475 --> 00:12:22.403
but it's certainly a few more than that,

00:12:22.427 --> 00:12:24.716
because other people died
over the next few days.

00:12:24.740 --> 00:12:26.787
So this was one problem they talked about,

00:12:26.811 --> 00:12:28.675
that it might be used indiscriminately.

00:12:28.699 --> 00:12:30.944
A second problem
people sometimes talk about

00:12:30.968 --> 00:12:32.936
with military use of nonlethal weapons --

00:12:32.960 --> 00:12:35.839
and it's actually why,
in the chemical weapons convention,

00:12:35.863 --> 00:12:38.436
it's very clear that you can't use
riot-control agents

00:12:38.460 --> 00:12:39.749
as weapons of warfare --

00:12:39.773 --> 00:12:43.802
is that it's seen that sometimes
nonlethal weapons might be used

00:12:43.826 --> 00:12:45.747
not as an alternative to lethal force,

00:12:45.771 --> 00:12:48.047
but as a lethal force multiplier:

00:12:48.714 --> 00:12:50.655
that you use nonlethal weapons first,

00:12:50.679 --> 00:12:53.655
so your lethal weapons
will actually be more effective.

00:12:54.157 --> 00:12:57.513
The people you'll be shooting at
won't be able to get out of the way.

00:12:57.537 --> 00:13:00.930
They won't be aware of what's happening,
and you can kill them better.

00:13:00.954 --> 00:13:02.986
And that's exactly what happened here.

00:13:03.691 --> 00:13:06.747
The hostage takers who had
been rendered unconscious by the gas

00:13:06.771 --> 00:13:08.189
were not taken into custody;

00:13:08.213 --> 00:13:09.912
they were simply shot in the head.

00:13:11.531 --> 00:13:15.576
So this nonlethal weapon
was being used in this case

00:13:15.600 --> 00:13:18.576
as a lethal force multiplier,

00:13:18.600 --> 00:13:22.049
to make killing more effective
in this particular situation.

00:13:23.440 --> 00:13:25.821
Another problem I want to quickly mention

00:13:25.845 --> 00:13:28.075
is that there's a whole heap of problems

00:13:28.099 --> 00:13:31.576
with the way people are actually
taught to use nonlethal weapons,

00:13:31.600 --> 00:13:34.133
and get trained about them
and then tested and so on.

00:13:34.157 --> 00:13:37.032
Because they're tested
in nice, safe environments,

00:13:37.056 --> 00:13:39.693
and are taught to use them
in nice, safe environments --

00:13:39.717 --> 00:13:43.002
like this, where you can see
exactly what's going on.

00:13:43.026 --> 00:13:45.801
The person spraying the OC spray
is wearing a rubber glove

00:13:45.825 --> 00:13:48.267
to make sure they don't get
contaminated, and so on.

00:13:48.291 --> 00:13:49.902
But they're never used like that.

00:13:49.926 --> 00:13:52.094
They're used out in the real world,

00:13:52.118 --> 00:13:54.452
like in Texas, like this:

00:13:54.476 --> 00:13:57.066
["Police Taser Great-Grandmother
During Traffic Stop"]

00:13:57.090 --> 00:14:00.576
I confess, this particular case
was one that piqued my interest in this.

00:14:00.600 --> 00:14:03.048
It happened while I was working
as a research fellow

00:14:03.072 --> 00:14:04.260
at the US Naval Academy.

00:14:04.284 --> 00:14:07.261
News reports started
coming up about this situation,

00:14:07.285 --> 00:14:09.685
where this woman was arguing
with a police officer.

00:14:09.709 --> 00:14:11.092
She wasn't violent.

00:14:11.116 --> 00:14:14.029
In fact, he was probably
six inches taller than me,

00:14:14.053 --> 00:14:15.591
and she was about this tall.

00:14:16.372 --> 00:14:18.079
And eventually she said to him,

00:14:18.103 --> 00:14:20.204
"Well, I'm going to get back in my car."

00:14:20.228 --> 00:14:23.370
And he says, "If you get back
in your car, I'm going to tase you."

00:14:23.394 --> 00:14:26.514
And she says, "Oh, go ahead.
Tase me." And so he does.

00:14:26.538 --> 00:14:28.553
And it's all captured by the video camera

00:14:28.577 --> 00:14:31.234
running in the front of the police car.

00:14:32.176 --> 00:14:34.318
So, she's 72.

00:14:35.072 --> 00:14:38.526
And it's seen that this is the most
appropriate way of dealing with her.

00:14:38.550 --> 00:14:41.675
And there are other examples
of the same sorts of things,

00:14:41.699 --> 00:14:42.865
where you think,

00:14:42.889 --> 00:14:46.219
"Is this really an appropriate way
to use nonlethal weapons?"

00:14:46.243 --> 00:14:48.875
"Police Chief Fires Taser
into 14 year old Girl's Head."

00:14:48.899 --> 00:14:51.463
"She was running away.
What else was I suppose to do?"

00:14:51.487 --> 00:14:53.709
(Laughter)

00:14:53.733 --> 00:14:55.001
Or Florida:

00:14:55.693 --> 00:14:58.503
"Police Taser 6-year-old
Boy at Elementary School."

00:14:58.527 --> 00:15:02.264
And they clearly learned a lot from it,
because in the same district:

00:15:02.288 --> 00:15:04.929
"Police Review Policy
After Children Shocked:

00:15:04.953 --> 00:15:07.660
2nd Child Shocked by Taser
Stun Gun Within Weeks."

00:15:07.684 --> 00:15:09.644
Same police district.

00:15:09.668 --> 00:15:12.853
Another child within weeks
of Tasering the six-year-old boy.

00:15:12.877 --> 00:15:16.362
Just in case you think it's only going
to happen in the United States,

00:15:16.386 --> 00:15:18.204
it happened in Canada as well:

00:15:18.228 --> 00:15:19.774
["Mounties Zap 11-year-old Boy"]

00:15:19.798 --> 00:15:21.908
And a colleague sent me
this one from London:

00:15:21.932 --> 00:15:23.802
["Arrested Man, 82, Shot with Taser"]

00:15:23.826 --> 00:15:28.237
But my personal favorite,
I have to confess, does come from the US:

00:15:28.261 --> 00:15:31.553
"Officers Taser 86-year-old
Disabled Woman in her Bed."

00:15:31.577 --> 00:15:33.783
(Laughter)

00:15:33.807 --> 00:15:35.911
I checked the reports on this one.

00:15:35.935 --> 00:15:38.009
I looked at it. I was really surprised.

00:15:38.033 --> 00:15:42.201
Apparently, she took up a more
threatening position in her bed.

00:15:42.225 --> 00:15:43.915
(Laughter)

00:15:43.939 --> 00:15:45.988
I kid you not,
that's exactly what it said:

00:15:46.012 --> 00:15:48.999
"She took up a more threatening
position in her bed."

00:15:49.366 --> 00:15:50.682
OK.

00:15:50.706 --> 00:15:52.151
But I'd remind you --

00:15:52.175 --> 00:15:54.691
I'm talking about military
uses of nonlethal weapons,

00:15:54.715 --> 00:15:55.873
so why is this relevant?

00:15:55.897 --> 00:15:59.119
Because police are actually
more restrained in the use of force

00:15:59.143 --> 00:16:00.610
than the military are.

00:16:00.634 --> 00:16:03.320
They're trained to be more
restrained in the use of force

00:16:03.344 --> 00:16:04.514
than the military are.

00:16:04.538 --> 00:16:07.080
They're trained to think more,
to try and De-escalate.

00:16:07.104 --> 00:16:09.451
So if you have these problems
with police officers

00:16:09.475 --> 00:16:10.641
with nonlethal weapons,

00:16:10.665 --> 00:16:12.308
what on earth would make you think

00:16:12.332 --> 00:16:14.847
it's going to be better
with military personnel?

00:16:15.474 --> 00:16:17.907
The last thing that I would like to say:

00:16:18.772 --> 00:16:20.209
When I'm talking to the police

00:16:20.233 --> 00:16:22.773
about what a perfect nonlethal
weapon would look like,

00:16:22.797 --> 00:16:24.811
they almost inevitably say the same thing.

00:16:24.835 --> 00:16:27.517
They say, "It's got to be something
that's nasty enough

00:16:27.541 --> 00:16:29.981
that people don't want
to be hit with this weapon.

00:16:30.005 --> 00:16:31.408
So if you threaten to use it,

00:16:31.432 --> 00:16:33.193
people are going to comply with it.

00:16:34.496 --> 00:16:36.404
But it's also going to be something

00:16:36.428 --> 00:16:38.507
that doesn't leave any lasting effects."

00:16:41.034 --> 00:16:42.191
In other words,

00:16:42.215 --> 00:16:45.817
your perfect nonlethal weapon
is something that's perfect for abuse.

00:16:45.841 --> 00:16:49.390
What would these guys have done
if they'd had access to Tasers,

00:16:49.414 --> 00:16:52.905
or to a manned, portable version
of the Active Denial System --

00:16:53.699 --> 00:16:56.163
a small heat ray that you
can use on people

00:16:56.187 --> 00:16:57.638
and not worry about.

00:16:58.543 --> 00:17:00.200
So I think yes,

00:17:00.224 --> 00:17:03.774
there may be ways that nonlethal weapons
will be great in these situations,

00:17:03.798 --> 00:17:05.757
but there's also a whole heap of problems

00:17:05.781 --> 00:17:07.679
that need to be considered as well.

00:17:07.703 --> 00:17:08.863
Thanks very much.

00:17:08.887 --> 00:17:11.611
