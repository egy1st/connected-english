WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Both myself and my brother

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
belong to the under 30 demographic,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
which Pat said makes 70 percent,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
but according to our statistics

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
it makes 60 percent of the region's population.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Qatar is no exception to the region.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
It's a very young nation led by young people.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
We have been reminiscing about the latest technologies

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
and the iPods,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
and for me the abaya,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
my traditional dress that I'm wearing today.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Now this is not a religious garment,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
nor is it a religious statement.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Instead, it's a diverse cultural statement

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
that we choose to wear.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Now I remember a few years ago,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
a journalist asked Dr. Sheikha, who's sitting here,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
president of Qatar University --

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
who, by the way, is a woman --

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
he asked her whether she thought

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
the abaya hindered or infringed her freedom in any way.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
Her answer was quite the contrary.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
Instead, she felt more free,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
more free because she could wear whatever she wanted

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
under the abaya.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
She could come to work in her pajamas and nobody would care.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
(Laughter)

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
Not that you do; I'm just saying.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
(Laughter)

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
My point is here, people have a choice --

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
just like the Indian lady could wear her sari

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
or the Japanese woman could wear her kimono.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
We are changing our culture from within,

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
but at the same time

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
we are reconnecting with our traditions.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
We know that modernization is happening.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
And yes, Qatar wants to be a modern nation.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
But at the same time

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
we are reconnecting and reasserting our Arab heritage.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
It's important for us to grow organically.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
And we continuously make the conscious decision

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
to reach that balance.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
In fact, research has shown

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
that the more the world is flat,

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
if I use Tom Friedman's analogy,

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
or global,

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
the more and more people are wanting to be different.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
And for us young people,

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
they're looking to become individuals

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
and find their differences amongst themselves.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
Which is why I prefer the Richard Wilk analogy

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
of globalizing the local

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
and localizing the global.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
We don't want to be all the same,

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
but we want to respect each other and understand each other.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
And therefore tradition becomes more important,

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
not less important.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
Life necessitates a universal world,

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
however, we believe in the security

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
of having a local identity.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
And this is what the leaders of this region

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
are trying to do.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
We're trying to be part of this global village,

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000
but at the same time we're revising ourselves

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.000
through our cultural institutions and cultural development.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
I'm a representation of that phenomenon.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
And I think a lot of people in this room,

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
I can see a lot of you are in the same position as myself.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000
And I'm sure, although we can't see the people in Washington,

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
they are in the same position.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
We're continuously trying to straddle

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
different worlds, different cultures

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
and trying to meet the challenges

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
of a different expectation

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
from ourselves and from others.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
So I want to ask a question:

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
What should culture in the 21st century look like?

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
In a time where the world is becoming personalized,

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
when the mobile phone, the burger, the telephone,

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
everything has its own personal identity,

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
how should we perceive ourselves

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
and how should we perceive others?

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
How does that impact our desert culture?

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000
I'm not sure of how many of you in Washington

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000
are aware of the cultural developments happening in the region

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
and, the more recent, Museum of Islamic Art

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000
opened in Qatar in 2008.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.000
I myself am personalizing these cultural developments,

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000
but I also understand

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
that this has to be done organically.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
Yes, we do have all the resources that we need

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000
in order to develop new cultural institutions,

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000
but what I think is more important

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000
is that we are very fortunate

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000
to have visionary leaders

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000
who understand that this can't happen from outside,

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000
it has to come from within.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000
And guess what?

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000
You might be surprised to know that most people in the Gulf

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000
who are leading these cultural initiatives

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000
happen to be women.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.000
I want to ask you, why do you think this is?

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000
Is it because it's a soft option;

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
we have nothing else to do?

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
No, I don't think so.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.000
I think that women in this part of the world

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000
realize that culture is an important component

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000
to connect people

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000
both locally and regionally.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000
It's a natural component

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000
for bringing people together, discussing ideas --

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000
in the same way we're doing here at TED.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000
We're here, we're part of a community,

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.000
sharing out ideas and discussing them.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000
Art becomes a very important part

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000
of our national identity.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:30.000
The existential and social and political impact

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
an artist has

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000
on his nation's development of cultural identity

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000
is very important.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000
You know, art and culture is big business.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000
Ask me.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000
Ask the chairpersons and CEOs

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000
of Sotheby's and Christie's.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.000
Ask Charles Saatchi about great art.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000
They make a lot of money.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000
So I think women in our society

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000
are becoming leaders,

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000
because they realize

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000
that for their future generations,

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000
it's very important

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000
to maintain our cultural identities.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000
Why else do Greeks demand the return

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000
of the Elgin Marbles?

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000
And why is there an uproar

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000
when a private collector tries to sell his collection

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000
to a foreign museum?

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000
Why does it take me months on end

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.000
to get an export license from London or New York

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.000
in order to get pieces into my country?

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.000
In few hours, Shirin Neshat, my friend from Iran

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.000
who's a very important artist for us

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000
will be talking to you.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000
She lives in New York City, but she doesn't try to be a Western artist.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000
Instead, she tries to engage

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.000
in a very important dialogue

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000
about her culture, nation and heritage.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.000
She does that through important visual forms

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000
of photography and film.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:45.000
In the same way, Qatar is trying to grow its national museums

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.000
through an organic process from within.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.000
Our mission is of cultural integration and independence.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000
We don't want to have what there is in the West.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.000
We don't want their collections.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.000
We want to build our own identities, our own fabric,

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000
create an open dialogue

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000
so that we share our ideas

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.000
and share yours with us.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.000
In a few days,

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.000
we will be opening the Arab Museum of Modern Art.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.000
We have done extensive research

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.000
to ensure that Arab and Muslim artists,

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000
and Arabs who are not Muslims --

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000
not all Arabs are Muslims, by the way --

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.000
but we make sure that they are represented

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.000
in this new institution.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000
This institution is government-backed

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000
and it has been the case

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000
for the past three decades.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000
We will open the museum in a few days,

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.000
and I welcome all of you to get on Qatar Airways

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.000
and come and join us.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.000
(Laughter)

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:41.000
Now this museum is just as important to us as the West.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.000
Some of you might have heard

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:46.000
of the Algerian artist Baya Mahieddine,

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.000
but I doubt a lot of people know

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.000
that this artist worked in Picasso's studio

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000
in Paris in the 1930s.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000
For me it was a new discovery.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.000
And I think with time, in the years to come

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000
we'll be learning a lot about our Picassos,

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000
our Legers and our Cezannes.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000
We do have artists,

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:07.000
but unfortunately we have not discovered them yet.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:10.000
Now visual expression is just one form

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.000
of culture integration.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000
We have realized that recently

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.000
more and more people

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.000
are using the means of YouTube and social networking

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:23.000
to express their stories, share their photos

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.000
and tell their own stories through their own voices.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.000
In a similar way,

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000
we have created the Doha Film Institute.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:32.000
Now the Doha Film Institute is an organization

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.000
to teach people about film and filmmaking.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.000
Last year we didn't have one Qatari woman filmmaker.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.000
Today I am proud to say

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.000
we have trained and educated

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.000
over 66 Qatari women filmmakers

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.000
to edit, tell their own stories

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.000
in their own voices.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:54.000
(Applause)

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.000
Now if you'll allow me, I would love to share a one-minute film

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.000
that has proven to show

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:02.000
that a 60-sec film can be as powerful as a haiku

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000
in telling a big picture.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:07.000
And this is one of our filmmakers' products.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:10.000
(Video) Boy: Hey listen! Did you know that the stocks are up?

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000
Who are you playing?

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.000
Girl: Uncle Khaled. Here, put on the headscarf.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.000
Khaled: Why would I want to put it on?

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.000
Girl: Do as you're told, young girl.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:21.000
Boy: No, you play mom and I play dad. (Girl: But it's my game.)

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.000
Play by yourself then.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:26.000
Girl: Women! One word and they get upset.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000
Useless.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:35.000
Thank you. Thank you!

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:43.000
(Applause)

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:46.000
SM: Going back to straddling between East and West,

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:49.000
last month we had our second Doha Tribeca Film Festival

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000
here in Doha.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.000
The Doha Tribeca Film Festival

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:56.000
was held at our new cultural hub, Katara.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.000
It attracted 42,000 people,

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.000
and we showcased 51 films.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000
Now the Doha Tribeca Film Festival

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000
is not an imported festival,

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.000
but rather an important festival

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:09.000
between the cities of New York and Doha.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.000
It's important for two things.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.000
First, it allows us to showcase

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.000
our Arab filmmakers and voices

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.000
to one of the most cosmopolitan cities in the world,

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.000
New York City.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.000
At the same time, we are inviting them

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.000
to come and explore our part of the world.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:26.000
They're learning our culture, our language, our heritage

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:29.000
and realizing we're just as different

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:32.000
and just the same as each other.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.000
Now over and over again,

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.000
people have said, "Let's build bridges,"

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.000
and frankly, I want to do more than that.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.000
I would like break the walls of ignorance

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.000
between East and West --

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.000
no, not the soft option that we have discussed before,

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.000
but rather the soft power

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:50.000
that Joseph Nye has spoken about before.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:53.000
Culture's a very important tool to bring people together.

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:56.000
We should not underestimate it.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.000
"Know thyself,"

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.000
that is the journey of self-expression and self-realization

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.000
that we are traveling.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.000
Now I don't pretend to have all the answers,

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.000
but I know that me as an individual

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.000
and we as a nation

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.000
welcome this community

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.000
of ideas worth spreading.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.000
This is a very interesting journey.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.000
I welcome you on board

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:19.000
for us to engage and discuss new ideas

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.000
of how to bring people together

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.000
through cultural initiatives and discussions.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:27.000
Familiarity destroys and trumps fear. Try it.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:30.000
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much. Shokran.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.000
(Applause)
