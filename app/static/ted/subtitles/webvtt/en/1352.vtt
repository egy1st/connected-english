WEBVTT

00:00:00.984 --> 00:00:04.769
Shall I ask for a show
of hands or a clapping

00:00:06.144 --> 00:00:08.244
of people in different generations?

00:00:08.268 --> 00:00:11.976
I'm interested in how many
are three to 12 years old.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.250
(Laughter)

00:00:17.274 --> 00:00:18.560
None, huh?

00:00:18.584 --> 00:00:19.959
(Laughter)

00:00:19.983 --> 00:00:21.190
All right.

00:00:21.809 --> 00:00:23.567
I'm going to talk about dinosaurs.

00:00:23.591 --> 00:00:25.976
Do you remember dinosaurs
when you were that age?

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.467
(Applause)

00:00:33.595 --> 00:00:35.976
Dinosaurs are kind of funny, you know.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.497
(Laughter)

00:00:38.521 --> 00:00:41.430
We're going to kind of go
in a different direction right now.

00:00:41.454 --> 00:00:42.976
I hope you all realize that.

00:00:43.554 --> 00:00:45.785
So I'll just give you my message up front:

00:00:46.355 --> 00:00:47.970
Try not to go extinct.

00:00:47.994 --> 00:00:49.332
(Laughter)

00:00:49.356 --> 00:00:50.542
That's it.

00:00:50.566 --> 00:00:54.976
(Laughter)

00:00:55.919 --> 00:00:57.117
People ask me a lot --

00:00:58.014 --> 00:01:00.666
in fact, one of the most asked
questions I get

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.976
is, why do children
like dinosaurs so much?

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.976
What's the fascination?

00:01:06.481 --> 00:01:08.976
And I usually just say,

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.976
"Well, dinosaurs were big,

00:01:11.831 --> 00:01:13.976
different and gone."

00:01:15.196 --> 00:01:16.494
They're all gone.

00:01:16.518 --> 00:01:17.976
Well that's not true,

00:01:18.588 --> 00:01:20.723
but we'll get to the goose in a minute.

00:01:20.747 --> 00:01:23.244
So that's sort of the theme:

00:01:23.268 --> 00:01:25.898
big, different and gone.

00:01:27.144 --> 00:01:28.809
The title of my talk:

00:01:28.833 --> 00:01:30.875
Shape-shifting Dinosaurs:

00:01:30.899 --> 00:01:32.976
The cause of a premature extinction.

00:01:34.005 --> 00:01:36.794
Now I assume that we remember dinosaurs.

00:01:36.818 --> 00:01:39.721
And there's lots of different shapes.

00:01:39.745 --> 00:01:42.198
Lots of different kinds.

00:01:42.222 --> 00:01:43.976
A long time ago,

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:49.838
back in the early 1900s,
museums were out looking for dinosaurs.

00:01:49.862 --> 00:01:51.975
They went out and gathered them up.

00:01:52.601 --> 00:01:54.368
And this is an interesting story.

00:01:55.203 --> 00:01:59.234
Every museum wanted a little bigger
or better one than anybody else had.

00:01:59.258 --> 00:02:06.046
So if the museum in Toronto went out
and collected a Tyrannosaur, a big one,

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:10.014
then the museum in Ottawa
wanted a bigger one, and a better one.

00:02:10.792 --> 00:02:12.620
And that happened for all museums.

00:02:12.644 --> 00:02:16.705
So everyone was out looking
for all these bigger and better dinosaurs.

00:02:17.901 --> 00:02:20.118
And this was in the early 1900s.

00:02:21.146 --> 00:02:23.976
By about 1970,

00:02:24.861 --> 00:02:29.161
some scientists were sitting around
and they thought, "What in the world --

00:02:29.715 --> 00:02:32.114
Look at these dinosaurs, they're all big.

00:02:33.752 --> 00:02:35.594
Where are all the little ones?"

00:02:35.746 --> 00:02:37.428
(Laughter)

00:02:38.574 --> 00:02:42.090
And they thought about it
and they even wrote papers about it:

00:02:42.114 --> 00:02:43.976
"Where are the little dinosaurs?"

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:50.455
(Laughter)

00:02:52.899 --> 00:02:55.976
Well, go to a museum, you'll see,

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:58.976
see how many baby dinosaurs there are.

00:02:59.662 --> 00:03:02.449
People assumed --
and this was actually a problem --

00:03:02.473 --> 00:03:06.777
people assumed
that if they had little dinosaurs,

00:03:06.801 --> 00:03:10.503
if they had juvenile dinosaurs,
they'd be easy to identify.

00:03:10.527 --> 00:03:14.400
You'd have a big dinosaur
and a littler dinosaur.

00:03:14.424 --> 00:03:15.725
(Laughter)

00:03:15.866 --> 00:03:17.976
But all they had were big dinosaurs.

00:03:18.983 --> 00:03:20.976
And it comes down to a couple of things.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.143
First off, scientists have egos,

00:03:25.778 --> 00:03:28.976
and scientists like to name dinosaurs.

00:03:29.655 --> 00:03:30.976
They like to name anything.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.957
Everybody likes to have
their own animal that they named.

00:03:34.981 --> 00:03:37.958
(Laughter)

00:03:37.982 --> 00:03:41.289
And so every time they found something
that looked a little different,

00:03:41.313 --> 00:03:43.166
they named it something different.

00:03:43.668 --> 00:03:45.070
And what happened, of course,

00:03:45.094 --> 00:03:48.761
is we ended up with a whole
bunch of different dinosaurs.

00:03:50.642 --> 00:03:52.976
In 1975,

00:03:54.296 --> 00:03:56.504
a light went on in somebody's head.

00:03:56.829 --> 00:04:01.054
Dr. Peter Dodson
at the University of Pennsylvania

00:04:01.078 --> 00:04:07.835
actually realized that dinosaurs
grew kind of like birds do,

00:04:08.668 --> 00:04:12.222
which is different
than the way reptiles grow.

00:04:12.246 --> 00:04:13.826
And in fact,

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:17.366
he used the cassowary as an example.

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:20.441
And it's kind of cool --
if you look at the cassowary,

00:04:20.465 --> 00:04:23.692
or any of the birds
that have crests on their heads,

00:04:23.716 --> 00:04:30.351
they grow to about 80 percent adult size
before the crest starts to grow.

00:04:31.434 --> 00:04:32.976
Now think about that.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.976
They're basically retaining
their juvenile characteristics

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.520
very late in what we call ontogeny.

00:04:39.544 --> 00:04:45.474
So allometric cranial ontogeny
is relative skull growth.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:52.432
So you can see that if you actually found
one that was 80 percent grown

00:04:53.461 --> 00:04:56.886
and you didn't know that it was going
to grow up to a cassowary,

00:04:56.910 --> 00:04:59.428
you would think
they were two different animals.

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:02.976
So this was a problem,

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:08.556
and Peter Dodson pointed this out
using some duck-billed dinosaurs

00:05:09.062 --> 00:05:10.563
then called Hypacrosaurus.

00:05:10.587 --> 00:05:15.453
And he showed that if you were to take
a baby and an adult

00:05:15.477 --> 00:05:18.778
and make an average
of what it should look like,

00:05:18.802 --> 00:05:21.538
if it grew in sort of a linear fashion,

00:05:22.053 --> 00:05:25.994
it would have a crest
about half the size of the adult.

00:05:26.236 --> 00:05:32.057
But the actual subadult at 65 percent
had no crest at all.

00:05:32.321 --> 00:05:33.976
So this was interesting.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:39.452
So this is where people went astray again.

00:05:40.111 --> 00:05:42.718
I mean, if they'd have just taken that,

00:05:42.742 --> 00:05:45.760
taken Peter Dodson's work,
and gone on with that,

00:05:45.784 --> 00:05:48.975
then we would have a lot less
dinosaurs than we have.

00:05:49.658 --> 00:05:53.432
But scientists have egos;
they like to name things.

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:59.143
And so they went on naming dinosaurs
because they were different.

00:06:00.145 --> 00:06:02.798
Now we have a way of actually testing

00:06:02.822 --> 00:06:07.741
to see whether a dinosaur, or any animal,
is a young one or an older one.

00:06:08.141 --> 00:06:11.392
And that's by actually
cutting into their bones.

00:06:11.889 --> 00:06:18.663
But cutting into the bones of a dinosaur
is hard to do, as you can imagine,

00:06:18.687 --> 00:06:23.731
because in museums, bones are precious.

00:06:25.842 --> 00:06:28.700
You go into a museum,
and they take really good care of them.

00:06:28.724 --> 00:06:31.792
They put them in foam, little containers.

00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:34.084
They're very well taken care of.

00:06:36.172 --> 00:06:40.086
They don't like it if you come in
and want to saw them open and look inside.

00:06:40.110 --> 00:06:41.111
(Laughter)

00:06:41.135 --> 00:06:44.544
So they don't normally let you do that.

00:06:44.568 --> 00:06:45.569
(Laughter)

00:06:45.593 --> 00:06:49.039
But I have a museum
and I collect dinosaurs

00:06:50.127 --> 00:06:51.991
and I can saw mine open.

00:06:52.015 --> 00:06:53.992
So that's what I do.

00:06:54.016 --> 00:06:58.691
(Applause)

00:07:00.705 --> 00:07:03.362
So if you cut open a little dinosaur,

00:07:03.386 --> 00:07:06.076
it's very spongy inside, like A.

00:07:06.100 --> 00:07:08.976
And if you cut into an older dinosaur,
it's very massive.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.077
You can tell it's mature bone.

00:07:12.101 --> 00:07:14.137
So it's real easy to tell them apart.

00:07:14.604 --> 00:07:18.309
So what I want to do is show you these.

00:07:18.333 --> 00:07:22.234
In North America in the northern plains
of the United States

00:07:22.258 --> 00:07:25.976
and the southern plains
of Alberta and Saskatchewan,

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.726
there's this unit of rock
called the Hell Creek Formation

00:07:29.750 --> 00:07:33.201
that produces the last
dinosaurs that lived on Earth.

00:07:33.225 --> 00:07:36.149
And there are 12 of them
that everyone recognizes --

00:07:36.173 --> 00:07:39.975
I mean the 12 primary dinosaurs
that went extinct.

00:07:40.613 --> 00:07:43.322
And so we will evaluate them.

00:07:44.139 --> 00:07:46.095
And that's sort of what I've been doing.

00:07:46.119 --> 00:07:51.250
So my students, my staff,
we've been cutting them open.

00:07:51.814 --> 00:07:55.657
Now as you can imagine,
cutting open a leg bone is one thing,

00:07:55.681 --> 00:07:58.740
but when you go to a museum

00:07:58.764 --> 00:08:02.975
and say, "You don't mind if I cut open
your dinosaur's skull, do you?"

00:08:03.454 --> 00:08:05.976
they say, "Go away."

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:10.976
(Laughter)

00:08:13.548 --> 00:08:14.976
So here are 12 dinosaurs.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.223
And we want to look at these three first.

00:08:18.745 --> 00:08:22.119
So these are dinosaurs
that are called Pachycephalosaurus.

00:08:22.143 --> 00:08:25.773
And everybody knows
that these three animals are related.

00:08:25.797 --> 00:08:32.098
And the assumption is that they're related
like cousins or whatever.

00:08:32.122 --> 00:08:37.958
But no one ever considered
that they might be more closely related.

00:08:37.982 --> 00:08:39.206
In other words,

00:08:39.230 --> 00:08:41.976
people looked at them
and they saw the differences.

00:08:42.585 --> 00:08:45.976
And you all know
that if you are going to determine

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.906
whether you're related
to your brother or your sister,

00:08:48.930 --> 00:08:51.976
you can't do it by looking at differences.

00:08:52.690 --> 00:08:56.191
You can only determine relatedness
by looking for similarities.

00:08:56.215 --> 00:08:58.214
So people were looking at these

00:08:58.238 --> 00:09:00.671
and they were talking
about how different they are.

00:09:00.695 --> 00:09:04.119
Pachycephalosaurus has a big,
thick dome on its head,

00:09:04.143 --> 00:09:06.840
and it's got some little bumps
on the back of its head,

00:09:06.864 --> 00:09:09.976
and it's got a bunch of gnarly things
on the end of its nose.

00:09:10.790 --> 00:09:16.546
And then Stygimoloch, another dinosaur
from the same age, lived at the same time,

00:09:16.570 --> 00:09:18.736
has spikes sticking out
the back of its head.

00:09:18.760 --> 00:09:20.732
It's got a little, tiny dome,

00:09:20.756 --> 00:09:23.581
and it's got a bunch
of gnarly stuff on its nose.

00:09:24.289 --> 00:09:27.976
And then there's this thing
called Dracorex hogwartsia.

00:09:29.227 --> 00:09:30.657
Guess where that came from?

00:09:30.681 --> 00:09:31.845
Dragon.

00:09:31.869 --> 00:09:35.621
So here's a dinosaur that has spikes
sticking out of its head,

00:09:35.645 --> 00:09:38.975
no dome and gnarly stuff on its nose.

00:09:39.484 --> 00:09:42.230
Nobody noticed the gnarly stuff
sort of looked alike.

00:09:43.102 --> 00:09:44.701
But they did look at these three

00:09:44.725 --> 00:09:47.180
and they said, "These
are three different dinosaurs,

00:09:47.204 --> 00:09:50.118
and Dracorex is probably
the most primitive of them.

00:09:50.142 --> 00:09:54.052
And the other one
is more primitive than the other."

00:09:54.156 --> 00:09:58.257
It's unclear to me how they actually
sorted these three of them out.

00:09:58.281 --> 00:10:00.174
But if you line them up,

00:10:00.198 --> 00:10:03.253
if you just take those three skulls
and just line them up,

00:10:03.277 --> 00:10:05.264
they line up like this.

00:10:05.288 --> 00:10:07.344
Dracorex is the littlest one,

00:10:07.368 --> 00:10:09.977
Stygimoloch is the middle-size one,

00:10:10.001 --> 00:10:11.976
Pachycephalosaurus is the largest one.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:15.976
And one would think,
that should give me a clue.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.329
(Laughter)

00:10:18.353 --> 00:10:19.883
But it didn't give them a clue.

00:10:19.907 --> 00:10:21.081
(Laughter)

00:10:21.105 --> 00:10:24.180
Because, well we know why.

00:10:24.204 --> 00:10:27.343
Scientists like to name things.

00:10:28.668 --> 00:10:31.404
So if we cut open Dracorex --

00:10:31.428 --> 00:10:33.353
I cut open our Dracorex --

00:10:33.377 --> 00:10:37.601
and look, it was spongy inside,
really spongy inside.

00:10:37.625 --> 00:10:41.324
I mean, it is a juvenile
and it's growing really fast.

00:10:41.904 --> 00:10:43.891
So it is going to get bigger.

00:10:43.915 --> 00:10:47.553
If you cut open Stygimoloch,
it is doing the same thing.

00:10:47.577 --> 00:10:51.207
The dome, that little dome,
is growing really fast.

00:10:51.231 --> 00:10:52.923
It's inflating very fast.

00:10:53.564 --> 00:10:56.940
What's interesting is the spike
on the back of the Dracorex

00:10:56.964 --> 00:10:59.043
was growing very fast as well.

00:10:59.067 --> 00:11:02.316
The spikes on the back of the Stygimoloch
are actually resorbing,

00:11:02.340 --> 00:11:06.474
which means they're getting smaller
as that dome is getting bigger.

00:11:06.498 --> 00:11:08.976
And if we look at Pachycephalosaurus,

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:12.251
Pachycephalosaurus has a solid dome

00:11:12.275 --> 00:11:17.243
and its little bumps on the back
of its head were also resorbing.

00:11:17.267 --> 00:11:20.976
So just with these three dinosaurs,

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.696
as a scientist, we can easily hypothesize

00:11:23.720 --> 00:11:27.975
that it is just a growth series
of the same animal.

00:11:29.199 --> 00:11:31.690
Which of course means

00:11:32.962 --> 00:11:37.681
that Stygimoloch and Dracorex are extinct.

00:11:37.705 --> 00:11:42.669
(Laughter)

00:11:42.693 --> 00:11:44.030
OK.

00:11:44.054 --> 00:11:45.204
(Laughter)

00:11:46.947 --> 00:11:52.379
Which of course means
we have 10 primary dinosaurs to deal with.

00:11:53.234 --> 00:11:58.171
So a colleague of mine at Berkeley --
he and I were looking at Triceratops.

00:11:58.195 --> 00:12:00.510
And before the year 2000 --

00:12:00.534 --> 00:12:04.206
now remember, Triceratops was first
found in the 1800s --

00:12:04.230 --> 00:12:09.395
before 2000, no one had ever seen
a juvenile Triceratops.

00:12:10.362 --> 00:12:13.906
There's a Triceratops
in every museum in the world,

00:12:13.930 --> 00:12:16.976
but no one had ever collected a juvenile.

00:12:18.418 --> 00:12:19.820
And we know why, right?

00:12:19.844 --> 00:12:21.976
Because everybody wants to have a big one.

00:12:22.844 --> 00:12:24.878
So everyone had a big one.

00:12:24.902 --> 00:12:27.310
So we went out and collected
a whole bunch of stuff

00:12:27.334 --> 00:12:29.341
and we found a whole bunch of little ones.

00:12:29.365 --> 00:12:31.976
They're everywhere,
they're all over the place.

00:12:32.584 --> 00:12:34.849
So we have a whole bunch
of them at our museum.

00:12:34.873 --> 00:12:39.323
(Laughter)

00:12:39.347 --> 00:12:42.011
And everybody says
it's because I have a little museum.

00:12:42.035 --> 00:12:44.755
When you have a little museum,
you have little dinosaurs.

00:12:44.779 --> 00:12:47.781
(Laughter)

00:12:47.889 --> 00:12:49.631
If you look at the Triceratops,

00:12:49.655 --> 00:12:51.887
you can see it's changing,
it's shape-shifting.

00:12:52.324 --> 00:12:55.854
As the juveniles are growing up,
their horns actually curve backwards.

00:12:56.236 --> 00:12:59.901
And then as they get older,
the horns grow forward.

00:12:59.925 --> 00:13:01.304
And that's pretty cool.

00:13:01.328 --> 00:13:03.643
If you look along the edge of the frill,

00:13:03.667 --> 00:13:08.833
they have these little triangular bones
that actually grow big as triangles

00:13:08.857 --> 00:13:11.561
and then they flatten against the frill

00:13:11.585 --> 00:13:15.159
pretty much like the spikes do
on the Pachycephalosaurs.

00:13:15.818 --> 00:13:20.299
And then, because the juveniles
are in my collection,

00:13:20.323 --> 00:13:21.803
I cut them open ...

00:13:21.827 --> 00:13:22.978
(Laughter)

00:13:23.002 --> 00:13:24.176
and look inside.

00:13:24.200 --> 00:13:27.345
And the little one is really spongy.

00:13:27.369 --> 00:13:29.743
And the middle-size one is really spongy.

00:13:29.767 --> 00:13:34.642
But what was interesting
was the adult Triceratops was also spongy.

00:13:34.666 --> 00:13:37.684
And this is a skull
that is two meters long.

00:13:38.113 --> 00:13:39.976
It's a big skull.

00:13:40.828 --> 00:13:45.475
But there's another dinosaur
that is found in this formation

00:13:45.619 --> 00:13:49.102
that looks like a Triceratops,
except it's bigger,

00:13:49.126 --> 00:13:51.094
and it's called Torosaurus.

00:13:51.955 --> 00:13:55.975
And Torosaurus, when we cut
into it, has mature bone.

00:13:56.437 --> 00:13:58.479
But it's got these big
holes in its shield.

00:13:58.503 --> 00:13:59.656
And everybody says,

00:13:59.680 --> 00:14:03.340
"A Triceratops and a Torosaurus
can't possibly be the same animal

00:14:03.364 --> 00:14:05.856
because one of them's bigger
than the other one."

00:14:05.880 --> 00:14:10.515
(Laughter)

00:14:10.539 --> 00:14:13.012
"And it has holes in its frill."

00:14:13.036 --> 00:14:15.995
And I said, "Well do we have
any juvenile Torosauruses?"

00:14:16.019 --> 00:14:20.606
And they said, "Well, no,
but it has holes in its frill."

00:14:21.463 --> 00:14:24.915
So one of my graduate
students, John Scannella,

00:14:24.939 --> 00:14:26.658
looked through our whole collection

00:14:26.682 --> 00:14:32.798
and he actually discovered that the hole
starting to form in Triceratops

00:14:32.822 --> 00:14:35.957
and, of course it's open, in Torosaurus --

00:14:35.981 --> 00:14:41.119
so he found the transitional ones
between Triceratops and Torosaurus,

00:14:41.143 --> 00:14:42.375
which was pretty cool.

00:14:42.399 --> 00:14:48.530
So now we know that Torosaurus
is actually a grown-up Triceratops.

00:14:49.964 --> 00:14:51.744
Now when we name dinosaurs,

00:14:51.768 --> 00:14:55.304
when we name anything,
the original name gets to stick

00:14:55.328 --> 00:14:59.173
and the second name is thrown out.

00:14:59.936 --> 00:15:02.128
So Torosaurus is extinct.

00:15:03.441 --> 00:15:07.259
Triceratops, if you've heard the news,
a lot of the newscasters got it all wrong.

00:15:07.283 --> 00:15:10.833
They thought Torosaurus should be kept
and Triceratops thrown out,

00:15:10.857 --> 00:15:12.641
but that's not going to happen.

00:15:12.665 --> 00:15:18.155
(Laughter)

00:15:18.179 --> 00:15:21.462
All right, so we can do this
with a bunch of dinosaurs.

00:15:21.486 --> 00:15:23.532
I mean, here's Edmontosaurus

00:15:23.556 --> 00:15:24.976
and Anatotitan.

00:15:25.423 --> 00:15:27.975
Anatotitan: giant duck.

00:15:28.632 --> 00:15:30.783
It's a giant duck-bill dinosaur.

00:15:30.807 --> 00:15:32.535
Here's another one.

00:15:32.559 --> 00:15:35.032
So we look at the bone histology.

00:15:35.056 --> 00:15:39.939
The bone histology tells us
that Edmontosaurus is a juvenile,

00:15:39.963 --> 00:15:41.591
or at least a subadult,

00:15:41.615 --> 00:15:47.368
and the other one is an adult,
and we have an ontogeny.

00:15:48.273 --> 00:15:50.226
And we get rid of Anatotitan.

00:15:51.400 --> 00:15:53.221
So we can just keep doing this.

00:15:53.245 --> 00:15:56.581
And the last one is T. Rex.

00:15:57.332 --> 00:16:01.976
So there's these two dinosaurs,
T. Rex and Nanotyrannus.

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:04.890
(Laughter)

00:16:04.914 --> 00:16:07.630
Again, it makes you wonder.

00:16:07.654 --> 00:16:10.864
(Laughter)

00:16:10.888 --> 00:16:13.223
But they had a good question.

00:16:13.247 --> 00:16:16.132
They were looking at them and they said,
"One's got 17 teeth,

00:16:16.156 --> 00:16:18.020
and the biggest one's got 12 teeth.

00:16:18.044 --> 00:16:19.914
And that doesn't make any sense at all,

00:16:19.938 --> 00:16:23.606
because we don't know of any dinosaurs
that gain teeth as they get older.

00:16:23.630 --> 00:16:25.878
So it must be true --

00:16:25.902 --> 00:16:27.195
they must be different."

00:16:28.643 --> 00:16:29.976
So we cut into them.

00:16:31.373 --> 00:16:35.250
And sure enough,
Nanotyrannus has juvenile bone

00:16:35.274 --> 00:16:38.866
and the bigger one has more mature bone.

00:16:39.439 --> 00:16:41.842
It looks like it could still get bigger.

00:16:41.866 --> 00:16:44.087
And at the Museum
of the Rockies where we work,

00:16:44.111 --> 00:16:47.750
I have four T. rexes,
so I can cut a whole bunch of them.

00:16:47.774 --> 00:16:49.976
But I didn't have to cut
any of them really,

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:52.976
because I just lined up their jaws

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:56.310
and it turned out
the biggest one had 12 teeth

00:16:56.334 --> 00:16:58.509
and the next smallest one had 13

00:16:58.533 --> 00:17:00.763
and the next smallest had 14.

00:17:00.787 --> 00:17:02.810
And of course, Nano has 17.

00:17:02.834 --> 00:17:05.721
And we just went out and looked
at other people's collections

00:17:05.745 --> 00:17:09.480
and we found one that has
sort of 15 teeth.

00:17:09.504 --> 00:17:12.282
So again, real easy to say

00:17:12.306 --> 00:17:16.975
that Tyrannosaurus ontogeny
included Nanotyrannus,

00:17:17.686 --> 00:17:22.325
and therefore we can take out
another dinosaur.

00:17:22.349 --> 00:17:23.976
(Laughter)

00:17:27.377 --> 00:17:30.670
So when it comes down
to our end Cretaceous,

00:17:30.694 --> 00:17:32.241
we have seven left.

00:17:34.099 --> 00:17:35.384
And that's a good number.

00:17:35.756 --> 00:17:38.976
That's a good number
to go extinct, I think.

00:17:39.604 --> 00:17:40.838
Now as you can imagine,

00:17:40.862 --> 00:17:43.623
this is not very popular
with fourth-graders.

00:17:43.743 --> 00:17:44.744
(Laughter)

00:17:44.768 --> 00:17:49.744
Fourth-graders love their dinosaurs,
they memorize them.

00:17:53.113 --> 00:17:54.843
And they're not happy with this.

00:17:54.867 --> 00:17:57.483
(Laughter)

00:17:57.507 --> 00:17:58.698
Thank you very much.

00:17:58.722 --> 00:18:02.626
(Applause)
