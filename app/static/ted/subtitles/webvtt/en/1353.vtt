00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
I'm here to share my photography.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Or is it photography?

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Because, of course, this is a photograph

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
that you can't take with your camera.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Yet, my interest in photography started

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
as I got my first digital camera

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
at the age of 15.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
It mixed with my earlier passion for drawing,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
but it was a bit different,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
because using the camera,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
the process was in the planning instead.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
And when you take a photograph with a camera,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
the process ends when you press the trigger.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
So to me it felt like photography was more about

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
being at the right place and the right time.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
I felt like anyone could do that.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
So I wanted to create something different,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
something where the process starts

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
when you press the trigger.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
Photos like this:

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
construction going on along a busy road.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
But it has an unexpected twist.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
And despite that,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
it retains a level of realism.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
Or photos like these --

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
both dark and colorful,

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
but all with a common goal

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
of retaining the level of realism.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
When I say realism,

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
I mean photo-realism.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
Because, of course,

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
it's not something you can capture really,

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
but I always want it to look like it could have been captured somehow

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
as a photograph.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
Photos where you will need a brief moment to think

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
to figure out the trick.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
So it's more about capturing an idea

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
than about capturing a moment really.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
But what's the trick

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
that makes it look realistic?

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
Is it something about the details

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
or the colors?

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
Is it something about the light?

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
What creates the illusion?

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
Sometimes the perspective is the illusion.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
But in the end, it comes down to how we interpret the world

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
and how it can be realized on a two-dimensional surface.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
It's not really what is realistic,

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.000
it's what we think looks realistic really.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
So I think the basics

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
are quite simple.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
I just see it as a puzzle of reality

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000
where you can take different pieces of reality and put it together

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000
to create alternate reality.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000
And let me show you a simple example.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.000
Here we have three perfectly imaginable physical objects,

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
something we all can relate to living in a three-dimensional world.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
But combined in a certain way,

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.000
they can create something that still looks three-dimensional,

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
like it could exist.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000
But at the same time, we know it can't.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
So we trick our brains,

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
because our brain simply doesn't accept the fact

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
that it doesn't really make sense.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000
And I see the same process

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000
with combining photographs.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000
It's just really about combining different realities.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.000
So the things that make a photograph look realistic,

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000
I think it's the things that we don't even think about,

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.000
the things all around us in our daily lives.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
But when combining photographs,

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000
this is really important to consider,

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.000
because otherwise it just looks wrong somehow.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000
So I would like to say that there are three simple rules to follow

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000
to achieve a realistic result.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.000
As you can see, these images aren't really special.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.000
But combined, they can create something like this.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000
So the first rule is that photos combined

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000
should have the same perspective.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000
Secondly, photos combined

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.000
should have the same type of light.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.000
And these two images both fulfill these two requirements --

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.000
shot at the same height and in the same type of light.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.000
The third one is about making it impossible to distinguish

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000
where the different images begin and end

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
by making it seamless.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
Make it impossible to say

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
how the image actually was composed.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:05.000
So by matching color, contrast and brightness

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000
in the borders between the different images,

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000
adding photographic defects

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000
like depth of field,

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.000
desaturated colors and noise,

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000
we erase the borders between the different images

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.000
and make it look like one single image,

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000
despite the fact that one image

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000
can contain hundreds of layers basically.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.000
So here's another example.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
(Laughter)

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000
One might think that this is just an image of a landscape

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000
and the lower part is what's manipulated.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.000
But this image is actually entirely composed

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.000
of photographs from different locations.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.000
I personally think that it's easier to actually create a place

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000
than to find a place,

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000
because then you don't need to compromise

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000
with the ideas in your head.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000
But it does require a lot of planning.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000
And getting this idea during winter,

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000
I knew that I had several months to plan it,

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000
to find the different locations

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000
for the pieces of the puzzle basically.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000
So for example,

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.000
the fish was captured on a fishing trip.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000
The shores are from a different location.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.000
The underwater part was captured in a stone pit.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.000
And yeah, I even turned the house on top of the island red

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.000
to make it look more Swedish.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000
So to achieve a realistic result,

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.000
I think it comes down to planning.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.000
It always starts with a sketch, an idea.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.000
Then it's about combining the different photographs.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.000
And here every piece is very well planned.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.000
And if you do a good job capturing the photos,

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000
the result can be quite beautiful

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.000
and also quite realistic.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:47.000
So all the tools are out there,

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.000
and the only thing that limits us

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:54.000
is our imagination.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000
Thank you.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:00.000
(Applause)
