00:00:00.445 --> 00:00:03.952
(Interpreter voice-over) Hello, everyone.
My name is Keith Nolan.

00:00:04.484 --> 00:00:05.991
I’m a cadet private.

00:00:09.208 --> 00:00:12.403
My talk today is on the topic
of the military.

00:00:13.007 --> 00:00:16.576
How many of you out there thought
you’d ever like to join the military?

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:18.542
I see a number of you nodding.

00:00:18.566 --> 00:00:21.241
And I thought the same thing
ever since I was young.

00:00:21.265 --> 00:00:24.014
Growing up, I’d always wanted
to join the military.

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:26.526
I loved military history

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.009
and I’ve read a great deal on the subject.

00:00:29.033 --> 00:00:33.280
Also, I have various family members,
such as my grandfather and great uncle,

00:00:33.304 --> 00:00:34.618
who fought in World War II.

00:00:34.642 --> 00:00:38.023
And like them, I wanted the same thing:
to serve my country.

00:00:38.047 --> 00:00:39.634
So the question is: Can I?

00:00:39.658 --> 00:00:40.912
No, I can’t.

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:43.325
Why? Simply because I’m deaf.

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:48.963
Regardless of that fact, I still had
that longing to join the military.

00:00:49.869 --> 00:00:53.451
For example, after I graduated
from high school,

00:00:53.475 --> 00:00:55.818
three months before 9/11 occurred,

00:00:55.842 --> 00:00:59.959
I went to a naval recruiting center
with high hopes of joining the navy.

00:00:59.983 --> 00:01:03.903
I went in and a strapping naval man
stood up and addressed me.

00:01:03.927 --> 00:01:08.106
As he was speaking to me,
it was impossible for me to read his lips,

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.792
so I said, “I'm sorry, I’m deaf.”

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:15.153
He tore off a little piece of paper
and wrote down three words:

00:01:15.177 --> 00:01:17.257
“Bad ear. Disqual.”

00:01:17.938 --> 00:01:20.159
He didn't even fully
spell out "Disqualified,"

00:01:20.183 --> 00:01:21.906
just: “Bad ear. Disqual.”

00:01:23.381 --> 00:01:25.543
So I went on my way.

00:01:25.567 --> 00:01:29.288
I tried various locations a number
of different times, trying to join,

00:01:29.312 --> 00:01:31.835
but over and over again,
I got the same response:

00:01:31.859 --> 00:01:34.012
“Sorry, you’re deaf. We can’t accept you.”

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:36.935
So I shifted gears
and decided to become a teacher.

00:01:36.959 --> 00:01:40.986
I completed a master's in deaf education
and taught for almost two years,

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:43.470
until this past spring,
when three things occurred

00:01:43.494 --> 00:01:45.135
that changed that course,

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:48.964
the first of which, while I was teaching
a high school history class.

00:01:48.988 --> 00:01:51.362
I’d lectured on the Mexican-American War.

00:01:51.386 --> 00:01:53.833
The bell had rung,
and I was seated at my desk,

00:01:53.857 --> 00:01:56.637
when one of my students,
who is deaf, approached me

00:01:56.661 --> 00:01:58.820
and said that he’d like
to join the military.

00:01:58.844 --> 00:02:00.997
I said, “Ah, sorry.
You can’t. You're deaf.”

00:02:01.576 --> 00:02:03.028
Then I caught myself.

00:02:03.052 --> 00:02:06.391
It struck me that all along
I had been told no, I can’t,

00:02:06.415 --> 00:02:08.574
and now I was perpetuating
that same message

00:02:08.598 --> 00:02:11.263
to the next generation, to my own student.

00:02:11.287 --> 00:02:14.981
That realization had a large impact
that really resonated with me.

00:02:15.005 --> 00:02:18.484
Now, the second thing that happened,
my friend had just moved to Israel.

00:02:18.508 --> 00:02:21.875
Did you know that in Israel
they accept deaf people into the military?

00:02:21.899 --> 00:02:24.065
How can deaf people be
in the military, right?

00:02:24.089 --> 00:02:26.195
Could this really be true? Come on!

00:02:26.219 --> 00:02:29.339
Well, I went to Israel last summer
to see for myself.

00:02:29.363 --> 00:02:32.222
I interviewed 10 deaf Israeli soldiers,

00:02:32.246 --> 00:02:35.008
all of those video interviews
and questions I’ve compiled,

00:02:35.032 --> 00:02:37.216
and the findings,
I’ll share with you later.

00:02:37.891 --> 00:02:40.801
Thirdly, CSUN here, my alma mater,

00:02:40.825 --> 00:02:43.732
had recently started up
an Army ROTC program.

00:02:44.464 --> 00:02:49.317
ROTC, which stands for
Reserve Officer Training Corps,

00:02:49.341 --> 00:02:51.641
allows students working on
their college majors

00:02:51.665 --> 00:02:54.286
to concurrently participate
in the ROTC program.

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:57.775
Upon graduation, ROTC students
have a military career

00:02:57.799 --> 00:02:59.419
ready and waiting for them.

00:02:59.443 --> 00:03:02.883
So if one joined the army, one could
commission as a second lieutenant.

00:03:02.907 --> 00:03:05.291
That's generally the ROTC
program here at CSUN.

00:03:05.767 --> 00:03:07.724
Having learned that, I was intrigued.

00:03:08.178 --> 00:03:10.200
I already had a profession as a teacher,

00:03:10.224 --> 00:03:13.177
but I went ahead anyway
and sent an email off to the program,

00:03:13.201 --> 00:03:15.334
explaining that I was
a teacher of the deaf,

00:03:15.358 --> 00:03:17.691
wondering if I could take
a few classes with them

00:03:17.715 --> 00:03:20.363
and perhaps share their lessons
with my students.

00:03:20.387 --> 00:03:22.135
I got an email response back,

00:03:22.779 --> 00:03:25.739
and surprisingly, it was the first
time that I wasn't told,

00:03:25.763 --> 00:03:27.920
"Sorry, no, you can’t. You’re deaf."

00:03:27.944 --> 00:03:29.969
It said, "Well, that's interesting.

00:03:29.993 --> 00:03:31.913
I think maybe we can work something out

00:03:31.937 --> 00:03:34.038
and you can take a few classes with us."

00:03:34.661 --> 00:03:36.128
This was unprecedented.

00:03:36.663 --> 00:03:38.613
So naturally, I was shocked.

00:03:38.637 --> 00:03:42.276
Although I was teaching, I decided I had
to grab the opportunity right away

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:43.658
and get my foot in the door.

00:03:43.682 --> 00:03:45.532
Altogether, that's how it transpired.

00:03:46.302 --> 00:03:48.556
Now, with all my life experiences,

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:52.303
having talked with all the people I had,
and given everything I’ve read,

00:03:52.327 --> 00:03:56.113
I decided to write a research paper
called “Deaf in the Military.”

00:03:56.137 --> 00:03:58.756
I'll share with you
what those 98 pages entail.

00:04:01.039 --> 00:04:04.925
Here in America, we’ve actually had
deaf soldiers serving in the past.

00:04:04.949 --> 00:04:07.826
In fact, during
the Texas War of Independence,

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:09.873
there was a key character
named Deaf Smith,

00:04:09.897 --> 00:04:12.368
who made a large contribution
to that war effort.

00:04:13.034 --> 00:04:14.611
For the American Civil War,

00:04:14.635 --> 00:04:18.727
Gallaudet University actually has archived
a list of deaf soldiers in that war

00:04:18.751 --> 00:04:20.441
from the North and the South,

00:04:20.465 --> 00:04:23.592
showing that deaf soldiers
were even fighting against each other.

00:04:23.616 --> 00:04:26.442
During World War II,
there are a few rare examples

00:04:26.466 --> 00:04:29.316
of deaf people who made it
into the military at that time

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:31.589
and were able to serve
their country as well.

00:04:31.613 --> 00:04:34.692
History illustrates the fact
that America has had deaf soldiers,

00:04:34.716 --> 00:04:35.996
in contrast to today.

00:04:36.326 --> 00:04:39.694
In my paper, I also discuss
the deaf Israeli soldiers.

00:04:40.073 --> 00:04:42.955
I learned that they serve
in non-combat roles.

00:04:42.979 --> 00:04:46.017
The deaf soldiers are not
on the front lines engaged in fire,

00:04:46.041 --> 00:04:49.291
but rather, are behind the lines
serving in supportive roles.

00:04:49.315 --> 00:04:52.783
There are a plethora of various
non-combat jobs accessible to the deaf:

00:04:52.807 --> 00:04:56.213
intelligence, computer technology,
map drawing, supply,

00:04:56.237 --> 00:04:57.483
military dog training --

00:04:57.507 --> 00:04:58.681
the list goes on.

00:04:59.466 --> 00:05:01.700
The communication
between deaf Israeli soldiers

00:05:01.724 --> 00:05:03.383
and other soldiers who are hearing

00:05:03.407 --> 00:05:06.590
is carried out with the same approaches
deaf people in general use

00:05:06.614 --> 00:05:08.578
with the hearing public on a daily basis.

00:05:08.602 --> 00:05:10.693
You can use your voice,
lip-read, gestures,

00:05:10.717 --> 00:05:14.141
sometimes another soldier knows
sign language and that can be utilized,

00:05:14.165 --> 00:05:17.358
pen and paper, texts, computers, emails --

00:05:17.382 --> 00:05:19.684
seriously, there’s no
magic wand necessary.

00:05:19.708 --> 00:05:21.545
It's the same thing we do every day.

00:05:21.945 --> 00:05:25.119
Interpreters are used there primarily
for boot camp training.

00:05:25.143 --> 00:05:28.912
For the average work, it’s not necessary
to have an interpreter by your side.

00:05:28.936 --> 00:05:31.334
The Israeli Army is comprised
of small groups.

00:05:31.358 --> 00:05:33.893
Each of these units with deaf
soldiers have developed

00:05:33.917 --> 00:05:36.144
their own way of communicating
with each other,

00:05:36.168 --> 00:05:37.956
so there’s no need for interpreters.

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:41.578
The top picture is of one soldier I met.

00:05:41.602 --> 00:05:43.844
The bottom photo
is of Prime Minister Begin

00:05:43.868 --> 00:05:45.696
with a deaf soldier in Israel.

00:05:47.965 --> 00:05:52.339
Another part of my paper touches on 
disabled soldiers in the US Military.

00:05:52.363 --> 00:05:56.001
Obviously, military work can be dangerous
and involve injury.

00:05:56.025 --> 00:05:58.936
One example here is Captain Luckett.

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:01.535
Due to an explosion, he lost his leg.

00:06:01.559 --> 00:06:04.401
He’s recovered and currently has
a prosthetic leg.

00:06:05.085 --> 00:06:10.308
Now that he’s strong, he's back in combat,
still fighting in Afghanistan.

00:06:10.863 --> 00:06:12.307
It’s remarkable.

00:06:12.331 --> 00:06:15.015
And guess what? He’s not the only one.

00:06:15.039 --> 00:06:17.228
There are 40 other soldiers like him,

00:06:17.252 --> 00:06:20.633
amputees who are serving in combat zones.

00:06:20.657 --> 00:06:21.817
Incredible.

00:06:21.841 --> 00:06:23.955
Also, we have a blind soldier here.

00:06:23.979 --> 00:06:25.383
While he was in Iraq,

00:06:25.407 --> 00:06:29.651
an explosion from a suicide car bomber
destroyed his eyesight.

00:06:30.345 --> 00:06:33.065
He’s recovered and hasn’t left the army.

00:06:33.089 --> 00:06:35.615
The army has retained him on active duty,

00:06:35.639 --> 00:06:38.857
and he’s currently running a hospital
for wounded soldiers.

00:06:38.881 --> 00:06:41.289
I also found out online
about another soldier,

00:06:41.313 --> 00:06:42.671
who is deaf in one ear.

00:06:43.210 --> 00:06:45.464
He’s developed civil programs in Iraq,

00:06:45.488 --> 00:06:49.010
one of which actually started
a school for the deaf in Iraq.

00:06:51.429 --> 00:06:52.864
All of this is incredible.

00:06:53.412 --> 00:06:55.666
But I am going to ask all of you:

00:06:55.690 --> 00:06:59.098
If the US Military can retain
their disabled soldiers,

00:06:59.122 --> 00:07:01.922
why can’t they accept
disabled citizens as well?

00:07:04.583 --> 00:07:10.483
Moreover, out of all the US Military jobs,
80% are non-combat positions.

00:07:10.818 --> 00:07:14.491
There are many jobs that we
in the Deaf community can do.

00:07:14.515 --> 00:07:17.855
If I were to be in the military,
I’d like to do intelligence work.

00:07:17.879 --> 00:07:20.143
But there is an array
of other things we can do,

00:07:20.167 --> 00:07:22.862
such as mechanics, finance, medicine, etc.

00:07:23.454 --> 00:07:27.146
So to summarize, I’ve presented
three premises to support my argument,

00:07:27.170 --> 00:07:30.727
the first being, Israeli defense
openly accepts deaf soldiers.

00:07:30.751 --> 00:07:33.926
If you have the qualities
and skills required, they’ll take you.

00:07:33.950 --> 00:07:36.582
Secondly, the US Military
has accommodations

00:07:36.606 --> 00:07:38.554
for retaining their disabled soldiers.

00:07:38.578 --> 00:07:43.378
And lastly, 80% of occupations
in the military are non-combat.

00:07:43.955 --> 00:07:46.868
Now, can we Deaf Americans
serve our country?

00:07:46.892 --> 00:07:49.702
Yes! Of course!
Absolutely, without a doubt!

00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:55.913
Now I’ll explain a bit
about my experience in the Army ROTC,

00:07:55.937 --> 00:07:57.292
which began last fall.

00:07:57.656 --> 00:08:00.981
I have been involved with that thus far
and it’s still going on now.

00:08:01.005 --> 00:08:03.064
Really, I need to preface this

00:08:03.088 --> 00:08:07.823
by saying that this is the first time
my battalion had ever had a deaf cadet.

00:08:07.847 --> 00:08:09.778
They had never experienced that before.

00:08:09.802 --> 00:08:13.970
So of course, they were taken aback,
wondering, initially,

00:08:13.994 --> 00:08:17.217
how I would do this or that,
how would we communicate and such,

00:08:17.241 --> 00:08:18.586
which is a natural reaction,

00:08:18.610 --> 00:08:21.886
considering that many of them
had never interacted with a deaf person

00:08:21.910 --> 00:08:23.061
prior to me.

00:08:23.085 --> 00:08:27.514
Plus, I was taken aback by this --
it was the real thing, the army.

00:08:27.538 --> 00:08:30.740
I had to learn a whole new world,
full of military jargon,

00:08:30.764 --> 00:08:32.832
with its own culture and everything.

00:08:34.184 --> 00:08:37.025
So we started out slow,
getting to know each other

00:08:37.049 --> 00:08:40.125
and learning how
to work together, progressively.

00:08:40.748 --> 00:08:44.813
For example, on the first day
of class, I had no uniform.

00:08:44.837 --> 00:08:46.512
So I showed up in regular clothes,

00:08:46.536 --> 00:08:48.789
while the other cadets
were all in uniform.

00:08:48.813 --> 00:08:54.450
I found out that every morning at 5:30,
there was physical training, PT.

00:08:54.474 --> 00:08:58.160
On Fridays, there would be
field training -- labs -- off-campus,

00:08:58.184 --> 00:09:02.043
and occasionally, we would have
weekend training at a military base.

00:09:02.067 --> 00:09:04.264
So I showed up, ready,
each morning at 5:30,

00:09:04.288 --> 00:09:07.372
with all the cadets in uniform
and me in civilian clothes.

00:09:07.396 --> 00:09:10.113
They told me, “Hey, you know,
you don't need to work out.

00:09:10.137 --> 00:09:11.784
You can just simply take classes.”

00:09:11.808 --> 00:09:13.355
I told them I wanted to, anyway.

00:09:13.379 --> 00:09:16.880
They acknowledged that, and I continued
to show up every morning to train.

00:09:16.904 --> 00:09:19.684
When Friday came,
I asked if I could do the field training.

00:09:19.708 --> 00:09:21.954
I was told no, just stick with class.

00:09:21.978 --> 00:09:24.029
I insisted that I wanted to try.

00:09:24.053 --> 00:09:27.056
Somewhat reluctantly,
they let me attend the lab,

00:09:27.080 --> 00:09:28.467
but only as an observer;

00:09:28.491 --> 00:09:32.090
I would only be allowed
to sit and watch, not participate.

00:09:32.578 --> 00:09:34.478
Alright, so, I showed up on Friday,

00:09:34.502 --> 00:09:37.464
and watched as the cadets learned
marching drill commands,

00:09:37.488 --> 00:09:40.144
like how to stand at attention,
how to properly salute,

00:09:40.168 --> 00:09:41.329
and all the basics.

00:09:41.353 --> 00:09:43.684
I had to ask again if I could join.

00:09:43.708 --> 00:09:45.044
Finally, I got the go-ahead.

00:09:45.068 --> 00:09:46.812
I went to get in formation.

00:09:46.836 --> 00:09:48.919
I figured I better stand
in the second line,

00:09:48.943 --> 00:09:52.222
so I could watch what the cadets
were doing in the row ahead of me.

00:09:52.246 --> 00:09:56.076
But the officer who opened the door
for me to join the ROTC program

00:09:56.100 --> 00:10:00.471
spotted me in the back and said,
“Hey! Uh-uh. I want you in the front.

00:10:00.495 --> 00:10:01.722
You want to be a soldier?

00:10:01.746 --> 00:10:04.642
You've got to learn the commands
just like the rest of them.

00:10:04.666 --> 00:10:07.515
You’re not going to follow other people.
Learn it yourself!”

00:10:07.539 --> 00:10:08.698
I thought, "Wow.

00:10:08.722 --> 00:10:11.633
He’s viewing me like any person,
giving dignity to who I am."

00:10:11.657 --> 00:10:13.354
I was impressed by that.

00:10:13.378 --> 00:10:16.514
So as the weeks went by,
I still didn’t have a uniform.

00:10:16.538 --> 00:10:20.018
I asked if it would be possible
to get one, but I was told it wasn't.

00:10:20.042 --> 00:10:21.598
So I continued on that way,

00:10:21.622 --> 00:10:25.853
until one day, I was informed
that I’d be getting a uniform.

00:10:26.385 --> 00:10:29.460
"Please!" I said, “Really?
Why? What changed?”

00:10:29.484 --> 00:10:33.466
I was told, “We see your motivation,
you show up every morning, dedicated,

00:10:33.490 --> 00:10:35.470
and always gave a 110% effort.”

00:10:35.494 --> 00:10:37.200
They wanted to give me the uniform.

00:10:37.224 --> 00:10:38.482
It was remarkable.

00:10:38.879 --> 00:10:40.923
We went to the warehouse
to get my uniform.

00:10:40.947 --> 00:10:44.126
I assumed I’d just get a uniform
and a pair of boots, nothing more.

00:10:44.150 --> 00:10:47.337
But they filled two duffel bags
chock-full of gear:

00:10:47.361 --> 00:10:50.552
helmet, ammo vest, shovel,
sleeping bag -- the whole nine yards.

00:10:50.576 --> 00:10:51.925
I was astonished.

00:10:53.392 --> 00:10:54.758
And I have to tell you,

00:10:55.965 --> 00:10:59.183
each morning that I get up
and put on my uniform,

00:10:59.207 --> 00:11:00.779
I feel privileged.

00:11:01.786 --> 00:11:04.206
It’s truly an honor to wear the uniform.

00:11:05.809 --> 00:11:07.816
So, moving along,

00:11:07.840 --> 00:11:10.139
when it came time to train
at the garrison base,

00:11:10.163 --> 00:11:12.087
at first, I was told I couldn’t go.

00:11:12.111 --> 00:11:14.230
There was concern on the ROTC's part

00:11:14.254 --> 00:11:17.300
that if the interpreter
were to get injured during the training,

00:11:17.324 --> 00:11:18.755
it would be a liability issue.

00:11:18.779 --> 00:11:21.384
So we had to figure out
all those issues and confusion,

00:11:21.408 --> 00:11:23.896
but we worked it out,
and in the end, they let me go.

00:11:23.920 --> 00:11:27.298
That's how events were unfolding;
I was permitted to do more and more.

00:11:27.322 --> 00:11:30.861
Once, at the garrison base,
during one of the training days,

00:11:30.885 --> 00:11:35.444
a huge Chinook helicopter with its
tandem rotors landed right down to us,

00:11:35.468 --> 00:11:37.637
forcefully spinning
exhilaration in the air.

00:11:38.006 --> 00:11:40.563
All of us cadets were supposed
to be getting on board.

00:11:40.587 --> 00:11:42.657
Everyone was geared up and ready.

00:11:42.681 --> 00:11:44.421
However, the cadre had decided

00:11:44.445 --> 00:11:47.108
I wasn’t going to be able
to ride the Chinook.

00:11:47.132 --> 00:11:49.514
They were afraid
if the pilot shouted out orders,

00:11:49.538 --> 00:11:51.770
how would I be able
to follow the instructions?

00:11:51.794 --> 00:11:53.693
I’d potentially cause a disruption.

00:11:54.069 --> 00:11:55.711
So I had to stand aside,

00:11:55.735 --> 00:11:58.745
while the others were filing
toward the helicopter.

00:11:58.769 --> 00:12:01.724
I could see the cadre huddled up,
discussing, mulling it over.

00:12:01.748 --> 00:12:05.165
At the last minute, one of them said,
“Come on! Get on the helicopter!”

00:12:05.189 --> 00:12:07.632
I rushed over and got in.
It was such a thrill.

00:12:09.159 --> 00:12:12.613
And that was the spirit of learning about
and supporting one another

00:12:12.637 --> 00:12:13.788
that carried over.

00:12:13.812 --> 00:12:16.571
And since then, I’ve been involved
in everything they do,

00:12:16.595 --> 00:12:17.818
without any separation.

00:12:18.342 --> 00:12:20.510
This is where my passion lies.

00:12:20.534 --> 00:12:23.324
I love them. I’ll show you
some pictures here.

00:12:24.569 --> 00:12:28.289
Bruin Battalion, Bravo Company --
that’s the name of the group I belong to.

00:12:28.313 --> 00:12:32.779
The cadre are the officers and sergeants
who oversee the ROTC program.

00:12:33.277 --> 00:12:36.402
In the beginning, you can see,
it was a bit of an awkward phase.

00:12:36.426 --> 00:12:39.571
But once they learned more about me
and what I’m capable of doing,

00:12:39.595 --> 00:12:41.617
there's been tremendous support and unity.

00:12:41.641 --> 00:12:45.012
The cadets, my fellow peers --
well, when you train and sweat together,

00:12:45.036 --> 00:12:47.211
you feel the bond
of camaraderie right away.

00:12:47.235 --> 00:12:50.120
A brother- or sisterly cohesiveness
makes them like family.

00:12:50.585 --> 00:12:54.322
In training and military science classes,
we learn theories of warfare,

00:12:54.346 --> 00:12:57.471
how to lead soldiers,
how to do reconnaissance,

00:12:57.495 --> 00:12:59.565
strategies, how to knock out a bunker

00:12:59.589 --> 00:13:03.625
and land navigation, where you’re finding
your way out in the mountains.

00:13:05.466 --> 00:13:09.345
As far as accommodations,
I’ve been provided with interpreters

00:13:09.369 --> 00:13:13.318
through the National Center on Deafness,
NCOD, here at CSUN.

00:13:13.342 --> 00:13:14.890
And I really have to thank them,

00:13:14.914 --> 00:13:16.827
because it's hard to find interpreters

00:13:16.851 --> 00:13:19.235
who are willing to wake up
at 4:30 in the morning,

00:13:19.259 --> 00:13:21.144
or sometimes even 3:30 in the morning.

00:13:21.480 --> 00:13:23.624
That's the officer who emailed me back,

00:13:23.648 --> 00:13:26.161
saying I think you can have
a few classes with us.

00:13:26.185 --> 00:13:27.944
That's Lieutenant Mendoza.

00:13:28.660 --> 00:13:31.200
That’s my interpreter there,
before class starts.

00:13:31.524 --> 00:13:35.078
This is a picture from last fall,
when we were new to training.

00:13:35.985 --> 00:13:38.303
This is Lieutenant Colonel Phelps,

00:13:38.824 --> 00:13:40.586
this being his name sign.

00:13:40.610 --> 00:13:43.824
He's the commanding officer
of the entire Bruin Battalion.

00:13:44.617 --> 00:13:48.446
Every time I see him walk by,
it’s rather inspiring.

00:13:48.470 --> 00:13:53.974
I mean, the way he presents himself,
you can see he’s the epitome of a soldier.

00:13:54.399 --> 00:13:56.569
Plus, he doesn't view me as a deaf person.

00:13:56.593 --> 00:13:59.242
He looks at my skills
and capabilities instead.

00:13:59.266 --> 00:14:02.452
He’s really pushed for me,
and I respect him for all that.

00:14:02.476 --> 00:14:04.332
That’s me during one of the exercises.

00:14:04.356 --> 00:14:07.131
This is that Chinook helicopter
I almost didn’t get on.

00:14:07.530 --> 00:14:09.669
Every cadet has a mentor.

00:14:10.202 --> 00:14:12.868
My mentor is Cinatl.

00:14:13.359 --> 00:14:15.225
He’s a really sharp soldier.

00:14:15.249 --> 00:14:18.949
He teaches me all the finer points
and how to execute them ideally.

00:14:19.774 --> 00:14:23.429
This top picture is when
a group of us went to Las Vegas

00:14:23.453 --> 00:14:24.778
to compete in a test,

00:14:24.802 --> 00:14:28.701
to see if we could match the German
troops' physical training standards.

00:14:28.725 --> 00:14:32.700
It involved swimming, timed sprints,
marksmanship and numerous fitness events.

00:14:32.724 --> 00:14:34.860
I passed them
and satisfied the requirements

00:14:34.884 --> 00:14:39.100
to be awarded the gold German Armed Forces
Proficiency Badge right here.

00:14:40.637 --> 00:14:43.444
This is one of the sergeants,
Sergeant Richardson.

00:14:43.468 --> 00:14:47.156
I love this guy. He doesn't take baloney
from any of us cadets.

00:14:49.505 --> 00:14:51.122
Here I am one morning,

00:14:51.146 --> 00:14:54.464
when we trekked seven and a half miles
with a 40-pound rucksack

00:14:54.488 --> 00:14:56.027
in less than two hours.

00:14:56.611 --> 00:14:58.783
Here are a few of my fellow cadets.

00:15:00.021 --> 00:15:04.676
I've been with them long enough
that I’ve developed name signs for them.

00:15:05.246 --> 00:15:07.298
On the right, here, is Trinidad.

00:15:07.322 --> 00:15:10.760
I gave him this name sign
because he's always very sarcastic.

00:15:10.784 --> 00:15:14.099
He's a veteran, having served
in Iraq and Afghanistan.

00:15:14.123 --> 00:15:17.191
The female is Frigo,
whose nickname is "Refrigerator,"

00:15:17.215 --> 00:15:18.436
hence her name sign.

00:15:18.460 --> 00:15:20.887
We’re always competing
intellectually in class.

00:15:20.911 --> 00:15:25.031
The cadet on the end is Jarvy.
He's a top athlete.

00:15:25.055 --> 00:15:28.065
I've given him this sign
because of the scar he has here.

00:15:28.588 --> 00:15:30.017
Do you know who this is?

00:15:30.041 --> 00:15:33.435
This is the Chairman
of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.

00:15:33.459 --> 00:15:35.655
He is the highest-ranking military officer

00:15:35.679 --> 00:15:38.614
and principal military advisor
to President Obama

00:15:38.638 --> 00:15:40.537
and Secretary of Defense Gates.

00:15:40.968 --> 00:15:43.572
He gave a talk at UCLA to a full house.

00:15:43.596 --> 00:15:45.598
Afterwards, I lined up to shake his hand.

00:15:45.622 --> 00:15:48.809
Having done so, I greeted him,
“It’s a great pleasure to meet you.”

00:15:48.833 --> 00:15:50.879
I signed and my interpreter voiced for me.

00:15:50.903 --> 00:15:54.456
Admiral Mullen turned to the interpreter
and said, “It’s nice to meet you,”

00:15:54.480 --> 00:15:57.078
addressing the interpreter,
who refrained to clarify.

00:15:57.102 --> 00:15:59.597
He seemed a little confused
and just quickly moved on

00:15:59.621 --> 00:16:01.731
to shake hands
with the rest of the soldiers.

00:16:01.755 --> 00:16:04.626
So I’m not sure whether he really knew
that I'm deaf or not.

00:16:04.650 --> 00:16:08.741
So everything’s been moving along,
gung-ho, full speed ahead,

00:16:08.765 --> 00:16:12.370
until two weeks ago,

00:16:12.816 --> 00:16:14.251
when something occurred.

00:16:15.149 --> 00:16:17.968
Well, the ROTC has four levels.

00:16:17.992 --> 00:16:22.476
I’m currently doing the first two levels,
which finishes up this May.

00:16:22.500 --> 00:16:24.401
The third level will begin in the fall.

00:16:24.425 --> 00:16:27.490
But in order to move up,
you need to pass a medical exam.

00:16:28.139 --> 00:16:32.629
Obviously, I’m deaf,
so I’d fail a hearing test.

00:16:34.471 --> 00:16:36.510
So we sat down,

00:16:36.534 --> 00:16:40.647
and I was told that if I wanted
to continue to the third level,

00:16:40.671 --> 00:16:44.433
I couldn’t do any
of the PT workouts in the morning,

00:16:44.457 --> 00:16:49.471
nor the Friday lab field trainings,
nor the army base trainings.

00:16:49.495 --> 00:16:51.887
My uniform, I would have to
give back as well.

00:16:52.800 --> 00:16:55.547
I could take the classes,
audit them, and that’s all.

00:16:56.968 --> 00:16:59.872
It really hit me. It was a huge blow.

00:17:03.037 --> 00:17:06.213
Many of the officers
and cadets have empathized

00:17:06.237 --> 00:17:08.566
with this sudden shock of disappointment,

00:17:08.590 --> 00:17:11.103
and are wondering
why this has to be the case.

00:17:11.587 --> 00:17:14.579
Colonel Phelps has tried
to speak with the higher-ups

00:17:14.603 --> 00:17:15.928
in the chain of command

00:17:15.952 --> 00:17:18.544
and explain to them
that I’m one of the top cadets,

00:17:18.568 --> 00:17:21.928
having passed all the events
and receiving high marks on my exams.

00:17:21.952 --> 00:17:23.587
But their response is unwavering:

00:17:23.611 --> 00:17:26.577
policy is policy, and if you’re deaf,
you’re disqualified.

00:17:27.717 --> 00:17:31.937
I know that the cadre has tried
to find various ways.

00:17:31.961 --> 00:17:35.560
They found out that
there's a deaf cadet at The Citadel,

00:17:36.555 --> 00:17:38.785
a military college in South Carolina.

00:17:39.770 --> 00:17:42.996
That particular cadet will be completing
his fourth year there

00:17:43.020 --> 00:17:44.187
and graduating this May.

00:17:44.211 --> 00:17:46.481
Yet, he's in the same
predicament that I'm in --

00:17:46.505 --> 00:17:48.718
unable to join the army because he’s deaf.

00:17:50.505 --> 00:17:53.258
Yet, all of my fellow cadets
and the officers have told me

00:17:53.282 --> 00:17:55.422
not to give up; the policy must change.

00:17:56.040 --> 00:17:58.090
I was advised to talk with my congressman.

00:17:58.114 --> 00:18:01.347
And I've brought this issue
to Henry Waxman,

00:18:01.371 --> 00:18:03.422
the district congressman here in LA,

00:18:03.446 --> 00:18:06.090
to get the ball rolling
with his advocacy for my cause.

00:18:06.114 --> 00:18:08.494
However, I need your help
and support to lobby.

00:18:08.518 --> 00:18:09.731
All of us, you know?

00:18:10.302 --> 00:18:13.449
If you remember back in US history,
African-Americans were told

00:18:13.473 --> 00:18:15.017
they couldn’t join the military,

00:18:15.041 --> 00:18:16.192
and now they serve.

00:18:16.216 --> 00:18:18.839
Women as well were banned,
but now they've been allowed.

00:18:18.863 --> 00:18:20.504
The military has and is changing.

00:18:20.528 --> 00:18:22.903
Today is our time. Now it’s our turn.

00:18:22.927 --> 00:18:24.088
