00:00:00.302 --> 00:00:02.913
I wanted to just start
by asking everyone a question:

00:00:03.137 --> 00:00:05.183
How many of you are completely comfortable

00:00:05.207 --> 00:00:06.961
with calling yourselves a leader?

00:00:08.294 --> 00:00:10.558
I've asked that question
all across the country,

00:00:10.582 --> 00:00:12.559
and everywhere I ask it, no matter where,

00:00:12.583 --> 00:00:16.116
there's a huge portion of the audience
that won't put up their hand.

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:18.636
And I've come to realize
that we have made leadership

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:21.070
into something bigger than us;
something beyond us.

00:00:21.094 --> 00:00:22.967
We've made it about changing the world.

00:00:22.991 --> 00:00:24.626
We've taken this title of "leader"

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:27.578
and treat it as something
that one day we're going to deserve.

00:00:27.602 --> 00:00:29.389
But to give it to ourselves right now

00:00:29.413 --> 00:00:32.848
means a level of arrogance or cockiness
that we're not comfortable with.

00:00:32.872 --> 00:00:35.395
And I worry sometimes
that we spend so much time

00:00:35.419 --> 00:00:38.252
celebrating amazing things
that hardly anybody can do,

00:00:38.276 --> 00:00:41.826
that we've convinced ourselves those
are the only things worth celebrating.

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.257
We start to devalue the things
we can do every day,

00:00:44.281 --> 00:00:46.437
We take moments
where we truly are a leader

00:00:46.461 --> 00:00:49.968
and we don't let ourselves take credit
for it, or feel good about it.

00:00:49.992 --> 00:00:52.093
I've been lucky enough
over the last 10 years

00:00:52.117 --> 00:00:55.148
to work with amazing people
who've helped me redefine leadership

00:00:55.172 --> 00:00:57.196
in a way that I think has made me happier.

00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:58.434
With my short time today,

00:00:58.458 --> 00:01:02.129
I want to share with you the one story
that is probably most responsible

00:01:02.153 --> 00:01:03.316
for that redefinition.

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:05.309
I went to a little school

00:01:05.333 --> 00:01:08.147
called Mount Allison University
in Sackville, New Brunswick.

00:01:08.171 --> 00:01:10.830
And on my last day there,
a girl came up to me and said,

00:01:10.854 --> 00:01:12.996
"I remember the first time I met you."

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.146
And she told me a story
that had happened four years earlier.

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.505
She said, "On the day
before I started university,

00:01:18.529 --> 00:01:20.593
I was in the hotel room
with my mom and dad,

00:01:20.617 --> 00:01:23.487
and I was so scared
and so convinced that I couldn't do this,

00:01:23.511 --> 00:01:26.571
that I wasn't ready for university,
that I just burst into tears.

00:01:26.595 --> 00:01:27.936
My mom and dad were amazing.

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.122
They were like, "We know you're scared,
but let's just go tomorrow,

00:01:31.146 --> 00:01:34.631
go to the first day, and if at any point
you feel as if you can't do this,

00:01:34.655 --> 00:01:36.814
that's fine; tell us,
and we'll take you home.

00:01:36.838 --> 00:01:38.235
We love you no matter what.'"

00:01:38.259 --> 00:01:39.886
She says, "So I went the next day.

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:41.394
I was in line for registration,

00:01:41.418 --> 00:01:44.722
and I looked around and just knew
I couldn't do it; I wasn't ready.

00:01:44.746 --> 00:01:45.897
I knew I had to quit.

00:01:45.921 --> 00:01:48.072
I made that decision
and as soon as I made it,

00:01:48.096 --> 00:01:50.168
an incredible feeling
of peace came over me.

00:01:50.192 --> 00:01:53.270
I turned to my mom and dad
to tell them we needed to go home,

00:01:53.294 --> 00:01:56.207
and at that moment, you came
out of the student union building

00:01:56.231 --> 00:01:58.722
wearing the stupidest hat
I've ever seen in my life."

00:01:58.746 --> 00:01:59.747
(Laughter)

00:01:59.771 --> 00:02:01.022
"It was awesome.

00:02:01.046 --> 00:02:03.251
And you had a big sign
promoting Shinerama," --

00:02:03.275 --> 00:02:05.304
which is Students Fighting
Cystic Fibrosis,

00:02:05.328 --> 00:02:07.193
a charity I've worked with for years --

00:02:07.217 --> 00:02:09.037
"And you had a bucketful of lollipops.

00:02:09.061 --> 00:02:11.564
You were handing the lollipops out
to people in line,

00:02:11.588 --> 00:02:12.931
and talking about Shinerama.

00:02:12.955 --> 00:02:16.097
All of the sudden, you got to me,
and you just stopped.

00:02:16.121 --> 00:02:18.262
And you stared. It was creepy."

00:02:18.286 --> 00:02:19.737
(Laughter)

00:02:19.761 --> 00:02:21.692
This girl knows what I'm talking about.

00:02:21.716 --> 00:02:22.718
(Laughter)

00:02:22.742 --> 00:02:26.374
"Then you looked at the guy next to me,
smiled, reached into your bucket,

00:02:26.398 --> 00:02:28.854
pulled out a lollipop,
held it out to him and said,

00:02:28.878 --> 00:02:32.020
'You need to give a lollipop
to the beautiful woman next to you.'"

00:02:32.044 --> 00:02:35.984
She said, "I've never seen anyone
get more embarrassed faster in my life.

00:02:36.008 --> 00:02:38.258
He turned beet red,
he wouldn't even look at me.

00:02:38.282 --> 00:02:40.627
He just kind of held
the lollipop out like this."

00:02:40.651 --> 00:02:41.952
(Laughter)

00:02:41.976 --> 00:02:44.549
"I felt so bad for this dude
that I took the lollipop.

00:02:44.573 --> 00:02:47.764
As soon as I did, you got
this incredibly severe look on your face,

00:02:47.788 --> 00:02:51.072
looked at my mom and dad
and said, 'Look at that! Look at that!

00:02:51.096 --> 00:02:52.494
First day away from home,

00:02:52.518 --> 00:02:55.025
and already she's taking candy
from a stranger?'"

00:02:55.049 --> 00:02:57.192
(Laughter)

00:02:57.216 --> 00:02:58.617
She said, "Everybody lost it.

00:02:58.641 --> 00:03:01.324
Twenty feet in every direction,
everyone started to howl.

00:03:01.348 --> 00:03:04.463
I know this is cheesy, and I don't know
why I'm telling you this,

00:03:04.487 --> 00:03:07.909
but in that moment when everyone
was laughing, I knew I shouldn't quit.

00:03:07.933 --> 00:03:10.765
I knew I was where I was supposed
to be; I knew I was home.

00:03:10.789 --> 00:03:14.122
And I haven't spoken to you
once in the four years since that day.

00:03:14.146 --> 00:03:17.228
But I heard that you were leaving,
and I had to come and tell you

00:03:17.252 --> 00:03:19.829
you've been an incredibly
important person in my life.

00:03:19.853 --> 00:03:21.652
I'm going to miss you. Good luck."

00:03:21.676 --> 00:03:23.726
And she walks away, and I'm flattened.

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:26.331
She gets six feet away,
turns around, smiles and goes,

00:03:26.355 --> 00:03:28.098
"You should probably know this, too:

00:03:28.122 --> 00:03:30.305
I'm still dating that guy,
four years later."

00:03:30.329 --> 00:03:31.474
(Laughter)

00:03:31.498 --> 00:03:33.980
A year and a half
after I moved to Toronto,

00:03:34.004 --> 00:03:35.881
I got an invitation to their wedding.

00:03:35.905 --> 00:03:36.912
(Laughter)

00:03:36.936 --> 00:03:39.468
Here's the kicker: I don't remember that.

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:41.845
I have no recollection of that moment.

00:03:41.869 --> 00:03:43.315
I've searched my memory banks,

00:03:43.339 --> 00:03:46.510
because that is funny and I should
remember doing it and I don't.

00:03:46.534 --> 00:03:49.317
That was such an eye-opening,
transformative moment for me,

00:03:49.341 --> 00:03:52.634
to think that maybe the biggest impact
I'd ever had on anyone's life,

00:03:52.658 --> 00:03:56.147
a moment that had a woman walk up
to a stranger four years later and say,

00:03:56.171 --> 00:03:58.327
"You've been an important
person in my life,"

00:03:58.351 --> 00:04:00.377
was a moment that I didn't even remember.

00:04:00.401 --> 00:04:02.460
How many of you guys
have a lollipop moment,

00:04:02.484 --> 00:04:04.554
a moment where someone
said or did something

00:04:04.578 --> 00:04:07.066
that you feel fundamentally
made your life better?

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:10.027
All right. How many of you have told
that person they did it?

00:04:10.493 --> 00:04:11.644
See, why not?

00:04:11.668 --> 00:04:12.819
We celebrate birthdays,

00:04:12.843 --> 00:04:15.514
where all you have to do
is not die for 365 days --

00:04:15.538 --> 00:04:16.695
(Laughter)

00:04:16.719 --> 00:04:19.008
Yet we let people
who have made our lives better

00:04:19.032 --> 00:04:20.516
walk around without knowing it.

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:23.055
Every single one of you
has been the catalyst

00:04:23.079 --> 00:04:24.230
for a lollipop moment.

00:04:24.254 --> 00:04:27.271
You've made someone's life better
by something you said or did.

00:04:27.295 --> 00:04:28.490
If you think you haven't,

00:04:28.514 --> 00:04:31.046
think of all the hands
that didn't go up when I asked.

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:33.459
You're just one of the people
who hasn't been told.

00:04:33.483 --> 00:04:35.819
It's scary to think of ourselves
as that powerful,

00:04:35.843 --> 00:04:38.731
frightening to think we can matter
that much to other people.

00:04:38.755 --> 00:04:41.422
As long as we make leadership
something bigger than us,

00:04:41.446 --> 00:04:43.362
as long as we keep leadership beyond us

00:04:43.386 --> 00:04:45.158
and make it about changing the world,

00:04:45.182 --> 00:04:47.769
we give ourselves an excuse
not to expect it every day,

00:04:47.793 --> 00:04:49.702
from ourselves and from each other.

00:04:49.726 --> 00:04:53.309
Marianne Williamson said, "Our greatest
fear is not that we are inadequate.

00:04:53.333 --> 00:04:55.400
[It] is that we are powerful
beyond measure.

00:04:55.424 --> 00:04:58.077
It is our light and not our darkness
that frightens us."

00:04:58.101 --> 00:05:01.293
My call to action today
is that we need to get over our fear

00:05:01.317 --> 00:05:04.319
of how extraordinarily powerful
we can be in each other's lives.

00:05:04.343 --> 00:05:06.597
We need to get over it
so we can move beyond it,

00:05:06.621 --> 00:05:09.391
and our little brothers and sisters
and one day our kids --

00:05:09.415 --> 00:05:11.898
or our kids right now --
can watch and start to value

00:05:11.922 --> 00:05:14.072
the impact we can have
on each other's lives,

00:05:14.096 --> 00:05:16.682
more than money and power
and titles and influence.

00:05:16.706 --> 00:05:19.848
We need to redefine leadership
as being about lollipop moments --

00:05:19.872 --> 00:05:22.402
how many of them we create,
how many we acknowledge,

00:05:22.426 --> 00:05:25.613
how many of them we pay forward
and how many we say thank you for.

00:05:25.637 --> 00:05:28.257
Because we've made leadership
about changing the world,

00:05:28.281 --> 00:05:29.441
and there is no world.

00:05:29.465 --> 00:05:31.624
There's only six billion
understandings of it.

00:05:31.648 --> 00:05:34.063
And if you change
one person's understanding of it,

00:05:34.087 --> 00:05:36.116
understanding of what they're capable of,

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:38.449
understanding of how much
people care about them,

00:05:38.473 --> 00:05:41.075
understanding of how powerful
an agent for change

00:05:41.099 --> 00:05:42.473
they can be in this world,

00:05:42.497 --> 00:05:43.992
you've changed the whole thing.

00:05:44.016 --> 00:05:46.539
And if we can understand
leadership like that,

00:05:46.563 --> 00:05:49.074
I think if we can redefine
leadership like that,

00:05:49.098 --> 00:05:50.947
I think we can change everything.

00:05:50.971 --> 00:05:53.741
And it's a simple idea,
but I don't think it's a small one.

00:05:53.765 --> 00:05:56.937
I want to thank you so much
for letting me share it with you today.
