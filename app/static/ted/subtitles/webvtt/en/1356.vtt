00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Penelope Jagessar Chaffer: I was going to ask if there's a doctor in the house.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
No, I'm just joking.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
It's interesting, because it was six years ago

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
when I was pregnant with my first child

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
that I discovered

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
that the most commonly used preservative

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
in baby care products

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
mimics estrogen

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
when it gets into the human body.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Now it's very easy actually

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
to get a chemical compound from products

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
into the human body through the skin.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
And these preservatives had been found

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
in breast cancer tumors.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
That was the start of my journey

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
to make this film, "Toxic Baby."

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
And it doesn't take much time

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
to discover some really astonishing statistics

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
with this issue.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
One is that you and I all have

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
between 30 to 50,000 chemicals

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
in our bodies

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
that our grandparents didn't have.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
And many of these chemicals

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
are now linked to the skyrocketing incidents

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
of chronic childhood disease

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
that we're seeing across industrialized nations.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
I'll show you some statistics.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
So for example, in the United Kingdom,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
the incidence of childhood leukemia

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
has risen by 20 percent just in a generation.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
Very similar statistic for childhood cancer in the U.S.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.000
In Canada, we're now looking at one in 10 Canadian children with asthma.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
That's a four-fold increase.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
Again, similar story around the world.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
In the United States,

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
probably the most astonishing statistic

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
is a 600 percent increase

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
in autism and autistic spectrum disorders

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
and other learning disabilities.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
Again, we're seeing that trend

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
across Europe, across North America.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
And in Europe,

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
there's certain parts of Europe,

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
where we're seeing a four-fold increase

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
in certain genital birth defects.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
Interestingly, one of those birth defects

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
has seen a 200 percent increase in the U.S.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
So a real skyrocketing

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
of chronic childhood disease

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
that includes other things

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
like obesity and juvenile diabetes,

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
premature puberty.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
So it's interesting for me,

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
when I'm looking for someone who can really talk to me

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
and talk to an audience about these things,

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
that probably one of the most important people in the world

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
who can discuss toxicity in babies

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
is expert in frogs.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
(Laughter)

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000
Tyrone Hayes: It was a surprise to me as well

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000
that I would be talking about pesticides,

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.000
that I'd be talking about public health,

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
because, in fact, I never thought I would do anything useful.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
(Laughter)

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000
Frogs.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000
In fact, my involvement in the whole pesticide issue

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000
was sort of a surprise as well

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000
when I was approached by the largest chemical company in the world

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
and they asked me if I would evaluate

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000
how atrazine affected amphibians, or my frogs.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
It turns out, atrazine is the largest selling product

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
for the largest chemical company in the world.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
It's the number one contaminant

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000
of groundwater, drinking water, rain water.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000
In 2003, after my studies, it was banned in the European Union,

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000
but in that same year,

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000
the United States EPA re-registered the compound.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000
We were a bit surprised when we found out

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
that when we exposed frogs

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000
to very low levels of atrazine -- 0.1 parts per billion --

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000
that it produced animals that look like this.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000
These are the dissected gonads of an animal

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000
that has two testes, two ovaries,

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000
another large testis, more ovaries,

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
which is not normal ...

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
(Laughter)

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
even for amphibians.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.000
In some cases, another species like the North American Leopard Frog

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.000
showed that males exposed to atrazine grew eggs in their testes.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000
And you can see these large, yolked-up eggs

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000
bursting through the surface of this male's testes.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000
Now my wife tells me, and I'm sure Penelope can as well,

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000
that there's nothing more painful than childbirth --

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000
which that I'll never experience, I can't really argue that --

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000
but I would guess that a dozen chicken eggs in my testicle

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.000
would probably be somewhere in the top five.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000
(Laughter)

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000
In recent studies that we've published,

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
we've shown that some of these animals when they're exposed to atrazine,

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
some of the males grow up

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000
and completely become females.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000
So these are actually two brothers consummating a relationship.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000
And not only do these genetic males mate with other males,

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000
they actually have the capacity to lay eggs

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.000
even though they're genetic males.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000
What we proposed,

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000
and what we've now generated support for,

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000
is that what atrazine is doing

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000
is wreaking havoc causing a hormone imbalance.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000
Normally the testes should make testosterone,

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000
the male hormone.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.000
But what atrazine does is it turns on an enzyme,

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000
the machinery if you will, aromatase,

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000
that converts testosterone into estrogen.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000
And as a result, these exposed males

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.000
lose their testosterone, they're chemically castrated,

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000
and they're subsequently feminized

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000
because now they're making the female hormone.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.000
Now this is what brought me to the human-related issues.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000
Because it turns out

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.000
that the number one cancer in women, breast cancer,

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.000
is regulated by estrogen and by this enzyme aromatase.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000
So when you develop a cancerous cell in your breast,

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:59.000
aromatase converts androgens into estrogens,

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000
and that estrogen turns on or promotes

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000
the growth of that cancer

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000
so that it turns into a tumor and spreads.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000
In fact, this aromatase is so important in breast cancer

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.000
that the latest treatment for breast cancer

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000
is a chemical called letrozole,

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000
which blocks aromatase, blocks estrogen,

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.000
so that if you developed a mutated cell, it doesn't grow into a tumor.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000
Now what's interesting is, of course,

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.000
that we're still using 80 million pounds of atrazine,

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.000
the number one contaminant in drinking water, that does the opposite --

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000
turns on aromatase, increases estrogen

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000
and promotes tumors in rats

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:35.000
and is associated with tumors, breast cancer, in humans.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000
What's interesting is, in fact,

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000
the same company that sold us 80 million pounds of atrazine,

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000
the breast cancer promoter,

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.000
now sells us the blocker -- the exact same company.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000
And so I find it interesting

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.000
that instead of treating this disease

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.000
by preventing exposure to the chemicals that promote it,

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000
we simply respond

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.000
by putting more chemicals into the environment.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000
PJC: So speaking of estrogen,

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.000
one of the other compounds that Tyrone talks about in the film

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.000
is something called bisphenol A, BPA,

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.000
which has been in the news recently.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.000
It's a plasticizer.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.000
It's a compound that's found in polycarbonate plastic,

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000
which is what baby bottles are made out of.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.000
And what's interesting about BPA

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.000
is that it's such a potent estrogen

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.000
that it was actually once considered for use

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.000
as a synthetic estrogen in hormone placement therapy.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.000
And there have been many, many, many studies that have shown

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.000
that BPA leaches from babies' bottles

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000
into the formula, into the milk,

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000
and therefore into the babies.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000
So we're dosing our babies,

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.000
our newborns, our infants,

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.000
with a synthetic estrogen.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000
Now two weeks ago or so,

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000
the European Union passed a law

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.000
banning the use of BPA

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.000
in babies' bottles and sippy cups.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.000
And for those of you who are not parents,

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.000
sippy cups are those little plastic things

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:55.000
that your child graduates to after using bottles.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.000
But just two weeks before that,

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:01.000
the U.S. Senate refused to even debate

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.000
the banning of BPA

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.000
in babies' bottles and sippy cups.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.000
So it really makes you realize

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.000
the onus on parents

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.000
to have to look at this and regulate this and police this

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.000
in their own lives

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.000
and how astonishing that is.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:19.000
(Video) PJC: With many plastic baby bottles

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:22.000
now proven to leak the chemical bisphenol A,

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.000
it really shows how sometimes

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.000
it is only a parent's awareness

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:30.000
that stands between chemicals and our children.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000
The baby bottle scenario proves

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.000
that we can prevent unnecessary exposure.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.000
However, if we parents are unaware,

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.000
we are leaving our children

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.000
to fend for themselves.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.000
TH: And what Penelope says here

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000
is even more true.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:55.000
For those of you who don't know, we're in the middle of the sixth mass extinction.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.000
Scientists agree now.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.000
We are losing species from the Earth

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.000
faster than the dinosaurs disappeared,

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.000
and leading that loss are amphibians.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.000
80 percent of all amphibians

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.000
are threatened and in come decline.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.000
And I believe, many scientists believe

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:12.000
that pesticides are an important part of that decline.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.000
In part, amphibians are good indicators and more sensitive

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.000
because they don't have protection from contaminants in the water --

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.000
no eggshells, no membranes

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.000
and no placenta.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:24.000
In fact, our invention -- by "our" I mean we mammals --

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.000
one of our big inventions was the placenta.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.000
But we also start out as aquatic organisms.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000
But it turns out that this ancient structure

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:34.000
that separates us from other animals, the placenta,

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.000
cannot evolve or adapt fast enough

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.000
because of the rate that we're generating new chemicals

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.000
that it's never seen before.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:43.000
The evidence of that is that studies in rats, again with atrazine,

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:46.000
show that the hormone imbalance atrazine generates causes abortion.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:49.000
Because maintaining a pregnancy is dependent on hormones.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000
Of those rats that don't abort,

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.000
atrazine causes prostate disease

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.000
in the pups so the sons

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.000
are born with an old man's disease.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.000
Of those that don't abort,

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.000
atrazine causes impaired mammary, or breast, development

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.000
in the exposed daughters in utero,

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.000
so that their breast don't develop properly.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.000
And as a result, when those rats grow up,

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:10.000
their pups experience retarded growth and development

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:13.000
because they can't make enough milk to nourish their pups.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:16.000
So the pup you see on the bottom is affected by atrazine

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.000
that its grandmother was exposed to.

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:21.000
And given the life of many of these chemicals,

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:24.000
generations, years, dozens of years,

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.000
that means that we right now

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.000
are affecting the health

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.000
of our grandchildren's grandchildren

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:33.000
by things that we're putting into the environment today.

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.000
And this is not just philosophical, it's already known,

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.000
that chemicals like diethylstilbestrol and estrogen,

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.000
PCBs, DDT

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.000
cross the placenta

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.000
and effectively determine

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.000
the likelihood of developing breast cancer

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.000
and obesity and diabetes

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.000
already when the baby's in the womb.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.000
In addition to that, after the baby's born,

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.000
our other unique invention as mammals

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.000
is that we nourish our offspring after they're born.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.000
We already know that chemicals

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.000
like DDT and DES and atrazine

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.000
can also pass over into milk,

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.000
again, affecting our babies

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.000
even after their born.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.000
PJC: So when Tyrone tells me

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:11.000
that the placenta is an ancient organ,

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.000
I'm thinking, how do I demonstrate that?

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.000
How do you show that?

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:17.000
And it's interesting when you make a film like this,

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:20.000
because you're stuck trying to visualize science

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.000
that there's no visualization for.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:25.000
And I have to take a little bit of artistic license.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:35.000
(Video) (Ringing)

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.000
Old man: Placenta control.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.000
What is it?

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:42.000
Oh what?

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:45.000
(Snoring)

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:50.000
(Honk)

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:54.000
Puffuffuff, what?

00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:00.000
Perflourooctanoic acid.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:05.000
Blimey.

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:08.000
Never heard of it.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:12.000
PJC: And neither had I actually

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.000
before I started making this film.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:17.000
And so when you realize that chemicals can pass the placenta

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:20.000
and go into your unborn child,

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.000
it made me start to think,

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:25.000
what would my fetus say to me?

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:28.000
What would our unborn children say to us

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:31.000
when they have an exposure

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:34.000
that's happening everyday, day after day?

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:52.000
(Music)

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.000
(Video) Child: Today,

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:58.000
I had some octyphenols,

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:01.000
some artificial musks

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:06.000
and some bisphenol A.

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.000
Help me.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:14.000
PJC: It's a very profound notion

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.000
to know that we as women

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.000
are at the vanguard of this.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.000
This is our issue,

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:23.000
because we collect these compounds our entire life

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:26.000
and then we end up dumping it and dumping them

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:29.000
into our unborn children.

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:31.000
We are in effect

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:33.000
polluting our children.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:37.000
And this was something that was really brought home to me a year ago

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.000
when I found out I was pregnant

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:41.000
and the first scan revealed

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:44.000
that my baby had a birth defect

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:46.000
associated with exposure

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.000
to estrogenic chemicals in the womb

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.000
and the second scan

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:52.000
revealed no heartbeat.

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:55.000
So my child's death, my baby's death,

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:58.000
really brought home the resonance of what I was trying to make in this film.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.000
And it's sometimes a weird place

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:03.000
when the communicator becomes part of the story,

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:05.000
which is not what you originally intend.

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:08.000
And so when Tyrone talks about

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:11.000
the fetus being trapped in a contaminated environment,

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:15.000
this is my contaminated environment.

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:18.000
This is my toxic baby.

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:21.000
And that's something

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:24.000
that's just profound and sad,

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.000
but astonishing

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:29.000
because so many of us don't actually know this.

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.000
TH: One of this things that's exciting and appropriate

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:35.000
for me to be here at TEDWomen

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:39.000
is that, well, I think it was summed up best last night at dinner

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:41.000
when someone said, "Turn to the man at your table and tell them,

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:44.000
'When the revolution starts, we've got your back.'"

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:46.000
The truth is, women,

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:49.000
you've had our back on this issue for a very long time,

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:51.000
starting with Rachel Carson's "Silent Spring"

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:53.000
to Theo Colborn's "Our Stolen Future"

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.000
to Sandra Steingraber's books

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:58.000
"Living Downstream" and "Having Faith."

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:01.000
And perhaps it's the connection to our next generation --

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:04.000
like my wife and my beautiful daughter here about 13 years ago --

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:06.000
perhaps it's that connection

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:08.000
that makes women activists

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:10.000
in this particular area.

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:12.000
But for the men here, I want to say

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:14.000
it's not just women and children that are at risk.

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:17.000
And the frogs that are exposed to atrazine,

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:19.000
the testes are full of holes and spaces,

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:21.000
because the hormone imbalance,

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:23.000
instead of allowing sperm to be generated,

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:25.000
such as in the testis here,

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:27.000
the testicular tubules end up empty

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:29.000
and fertility goes down by as much as 50 percent.

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:32.000
It's not just my work in amphibians,

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:35.000
but similar work has been shown in fish in Europe,

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:38.000
holes in the testes and absence of sperm in reptiles in a group from South America

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:40.000
and in rats, an absence of sperm

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:43.000
in the testicular tubules as well.

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:45.000
And of course, we don't do these experiments in humans,

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:47.000
but just by coincidence,

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:49.000
my colleague has shown

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:51.000
that men who have low sperm count, low semen quality

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:54.000
have significantly more atrazine in their urine.

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:56.000
These are just men who live

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:58.000
in an agricultural community.

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:00.000
Men who actually work in agriculture

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:03.000
have much higher levels of atrazine.

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:05.000
And the men who actually apply atrazine

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:08.000
have even more atrazine in their urine,

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:11.000
up to levels that are 24,000 times what we know to be active

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:14.000
are present in the urine of these men.

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:17.000
Of course, most of them, 90 percent are Mexican, Mexican-American.

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:19.000
And it's not just atrazine they're exposed to.

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:22.000
They're exposed to chemicals like chloropicrin,

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:24.000
which was originally used as a nerve gas.

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:26.000
And many of these workers

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:28.000
have life expectancies of only 50.

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:31.000
It shouldn't come to any surprise that the things that happen in wildlife

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:33.000
are also a warning to us,

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:35.000
just like Rachel Carson and others have warned.

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:38.000
As evident in this slide from Lake Nabugabo in Uganda,

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:40.000
the agricultural runoff from this crop,

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:42.000
which goes into these buckets,

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:45.000
is the sole source of drinking, cooking and bathing water for this village.

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:47.000
Now if I told the men in this village

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:49.000
that the frogs have pour immune function

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:51.000
and eggs developing in their testes,

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:53.000
the connection between environmental health and public health

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:55.000
would be clear.

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:58.000
You would not drink water that you knew was having this kind of impact

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:00.000
on the wildlife that lived in it.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:02.000
The problem is, in my village, Oakland,

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:04.000
in most of our villages,

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:06.000
we don't see that connection.

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:08.000
We turn on the faucet, the water comes out, we assume it's safe,

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:11.000
and we assume that we are masters of our environment,

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:14.000
rather than being part of it.

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:16.000
PJC: So it doesn't take much to realize

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:19.000
that actually this is an environmental issue.

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:22.000
And I kept thinking over and over again

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:24.000
this question.

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:27.000
We know so much about global warming and climate change,

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:29.000
and yet, we have no concept

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:31.000
of what I've been calling internal environmentalism.

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:33.000
We know what we're putting out there,

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:35.000
we have a sense of those repercussions,

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:37.000
but we are so ignorant of this sense

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:40.000
of what happens when we put things, or things are put

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:42.000
into our bodies.

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:44.000
And it's my feeling

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:46.000
and it's my urging being here

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:48.000
to know that, as we women move forward

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:50.000
as the communicators of this,

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:53.000
but also as the ones who carry that burden

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:56.000
of carrying the children, bearing the children,

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:59.000
we hold most of the buying power in the household,

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:02.000
is that it's going to be us moving forward

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:05.000
to carry the work of Tyrone and other scientists around the world.

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:07.000
And my urging is

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:09.000
that when we think about environmental issues

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:13.000
that we remember that it's not just about melting glaciers and ice caps,

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:15.000
but it's also about our children as well.

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:17.000
Thank you.

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:27.000
(Applause)
