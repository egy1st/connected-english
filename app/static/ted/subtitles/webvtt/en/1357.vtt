00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.446
Every year in the United States alone,

00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:09.962
2,077,000 couples make
a legal and spiritual decision

00:00:09.986 --> 00:00:13.216
to spend the rest
of their lives together --

00:00:13.882 --> 00:00:15.032
(Laughter)

00:00:15.056 --> 00:00:18.484
And not to have sex with anyone else.

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:20.714
Ever.

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:23.815
He buys a ring, she buys a dress.

00:00:24.799 --> 00:00:28.216
They go shopping for all sorts of things.

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:32.755
She takes him to Arthur Murray
for ballroom-dancing lessons.

00:00:33.688 --> 00:00:35.220
And the big day comes.

00:00:35.244 --> 00:00:38.144
And they'll stand before God and family

00:00:38.168 --> 00:00:41.108
and some guy her dad
once did business with,

00:00:41.132 --> 00:00:43.717
and they'll vow that nothing --

00:00:43.741 --> 00:00:46.021
not abject poverty,

00:00:46.045 --> 00:00:48.169
not life-threatening illness,

00:00:48.193 --> 00:00:51.605
not complete and utter misery --

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:56.959
will ever put the tiniest damper
on their eternal love and devotion.

00:00:56.983 --> 00:00:58.731
(Laughter)

00:00:58.755 --> 00:01:03.041
These optimistic young bastards
promise to honor and cherish each other

00:01:03.065 --> 00:01:06.868
through hot flashes and midlife crises

00:01:06.892 --> 00:01:10.332
and a cumulative 50-pound weight gain,

00:01:10.356 --> 00:01:17.323
until that far-off day, when one of them
is finally able to rest in peace.

00:01:17.415 --> 00:01:18.565
(Laughter)

00:01:18.589 --> 00:01:21.184
You know, because they can't hear
the snoring anymore.

00:01:21.527 --> 00:01:23.331
And then they'll get stupid drunk

00:01:23.355 --> 00:01:26.459
and smash cake in each other's faces
and do the Macarena.

00:01:26.483 --> 00:01:28.086
And we'll be there,

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:32.520
showering them with towels and toasters
and drinking their free booze

00:01:32.544 --> 00:01:35.905
and throwing birdseed at them
every single time ...

00:01:36.718 --> 00:01:40.404
even though we know, statistically,

00:01:40.428 --> 00:01:43.523
half of them will be divorced
within a decade.

00:01:43.547 --> 00:01:45.198
(Laughter)

00:01:46.126 --> 00:01:48.809
Of course, the other half won't, right?

00:01:48.833 --> 00:01:51.808
They'll keep forgetting anniversaries

00:01:51.832 --> 00:01:54.320
and arguing about where to spend holidays

00:01:54.344 --> 00:01:55.507
and debating --

00:01:55.531 --> 00:01:56.599
(Laughter)

00:01:56.623 --> 00:02:00.053
Which way the toilet paper
should come off of the roll.

00:02:00.787 --> 00:02:06.277
And some of them will even still
be enjoying each other's company

00:02:06.301 --> 00:02:09.112
when neither of them can chew
solid food anymore.

00:02:09.749 --> 00:02:12.645
And researchers want to know why.

00:02:12.669 --> 00:02:16.177
I mean, look -- it doesn't take
a double-blind, placebo-controlled study

00:02:16.201 --> 00:02:19.136
to figure out what makes
a marriage not work:

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:21.617
disrespect, boredom,

00:02:22.403 --> 00:02:24.129
too much time on Facebook,

00:02:24.153 --> 00:02:26.169
having sex with other people.

00:02:26.193 --> 00:02:29.703
But you can have the exact
opposite of all of those things --

00:02:29.727 --> 00:02:32.471
respect, excitement,

00:02:32.495 --> 00:02:34.666
a broken Internet connection,

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:37.786
mind-numbing monogamy --

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:41.303
and the thing still can go
to hell in a handbasket.

00:02:41.723 --> 00:02:44.257
So, what's going on when it doesn't?

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:49.230
What do the folks who make it all the way
to side-by-side burial plots

00:02:49.254 --> 00:02:50.817
have in common?

00:02:50.841 --> 00:02:52.551
What are they doing right?

00:02:52.575 --> 00:02:54.801
What can we learn from them?

00:02:55.499 --> 00:02:59.258
And if you're still happily sleeping solo,

00:02:59.282 --> 00:03:03.694
why should you stop what you're doing
and make it your life's work

00:03:03.718 --> 00:03:06.411
to find that one special person

00:03:06.435 --> 00:03:08.976
that you can annoy
for the rest of your life?

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:12.789
Well, researchers spend
billions of your tax dollars

00:03:12.813 --> 00:03:14.649
trying to figure that out.

00:03:14.673 --> 00:03:16.640
They stalk blissful couples

00:03:16.664 --> 00:03:19.866
and study their every move and mannerism.

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:23.678
And they try to pinpoint
what it is that sets them apart

00:03:23.702 --> 00:03:25.945
from their miserable
neighbors and friends.

00:03:25.969 --> 00:03:31.675
And it turns out, the success stories
share a few similarities,

00:03:31.802 --> 00:03:34.381
beyond that they don't have sex
with other people.

00:03:34.928 --> 00:03:37.953
For instance, in the happiest marriages,

00:03:37.977 --> 00:03:39.815
the wife is thinner and better-looking

00:03:39.839 --> 00:03:41.005
than the husband.

00:03:41.029 --> 00:03:42.119
(Laughter)

00:03:42.143 --> 00:03:44.360
Obvious. Right?

00:03:44.384 --> 00:03:46.896
It's obvious that this leads
to marital bliss,

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:50.573
because women -- we care a great deal
about being thin and good-looking,

00:03:50.597 --> 00:03:52.976
whereas men mostly care about sex,

00:03:54.122 --> 00:03:57.634
ideally, with women who are thinner
and better looking than they are.

00:03:58.241 --> 00:03:59.988
The beauty of this research, though,

00:04:00.012 --> 00:04:03.488
is that no one is suggesting
that women have to be thin to be happy.

00:04:04.289 --> 00:04:06.699
We just have to be thinner
than our partners.

00:04:06.723 --> 00:04:11.223
So instead of all that laborious
dieting and exercising,

00:04:11.247 --> 00:04:13.454
we just need to wait
for them to get fat --

00:04:13.478 --> 00:04:14.750
(Laughter)

00:04:14.774 --> 00:04:16.648
Maybe bake a few pies.

00:04:16.672 --> 00:04:20.025
This is good information to have,
and it's not that complicated.

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:21.075
(Laughter)

00:04:21.099 --> 00:04:23.211
Research also suggests

00:04:23.235 --> 00:04:28.426
that the happiest couples are the ones
that focus on the positives.

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:30.014
For example: the happy wife.

00:04:30.038 --> 00:04:32.380
Instead of pointing out
her husband's growing gut

00:04:32.404 --> 00:04:34.965
or suggesting he go for a run,

00:04:34.989 --> 00:04:36.334
she might say,

00:04:36.358 --> 00:04:39.642
"Wow, honey, thank you
for going out of your way

00:04:39.666 --> 00:04:41.533
to make me relatively thinner."

00:04:41.557 --> 00:04:42.561
(Laughter)

00:04:42.585 --> 00:04:45.770
These are couples
who can find good in any situation.

00:04:45.794 --> 00:04:49.796
"Yeah, it was devastating
when we lost everything in that fire.

00:04:51.046 --> 00:04:53.845
But it's kind of nice sleeping
out here under the stars.

00:04:53.869 --> 00:04:57.071
And it's a good thing you've got
all that body fat to keep us warm."

00:04:57.095 --> 00:04:58.298
(Laughter)

00:04:58.322 --> 00:05:00.220
One of my favorite studies found

00:05:00.244 --> 00:05:03.371
that the more willing
a husband is to do housework,

00:05:03.395 --> 00:05:05.677
the more attractive
his wife will find him.

00:05:07.162 --> 00:05:09.399
Because we needed a study to tell us this.

00:05:09.423 --> 00:05:10.695
(Laughter)

00:05:10.719 --> 00:05:12.255
But here's what's going on here.

00:05:12.279 --> 00:05:15.419
The more attractive she finds him,
the more sex they have;

00:05:15.443 --> 00:05:17.865
the more sex they have,
the nicer he is to her;

00:05:17.889 --> 00:05:19.589
the nicer he is to her,

00:05:19.613 --> 00:05:22.423
the less she nags him
about leaving wet towels on the bed,

00:05:22.447 --> 00:05:25.124
and ultimately,
they live happily ever after.

00:05:25.549 --> 00:05:28.935
In other words, men,
you might want to pick it up a notch

00:05:28.959 --> 00:05:30.481
in the domestic department.

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:32.989
Here's an interesting one.

00:05:33.365 --> 00:05:38.422
One study found that people
who smile in childhood photographs

00:05:38.446 --> 00:05:40.338
are less likely to get a divorce.

00:05:41.584 --> 00:05:44.425
This is an actual study,
and let me clarify:

00:05:44.449 --> 00:05:47.730
the researchers were not looking
at documented self-reports

00:05:47.754 --> 00:05:49.034
of childhood happiness,

00:05:49.058 --> 00:05:51.086
or even studying old journals.

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:55.681
The data were based entirely
on whether people looked happy

00:05:55.705 --> 00:05:56.999
in these early pictures.

00:05:57.786 --> 00:06:02.287
Now, I don't know how old all of you are,
but when I was a kid,

00:06:02.311 --> 00:06:05.025
your parents took pictures
with a special kind of camera

00:06:05.049 --> 00:06:06.902
that held something called "film."

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:10.351
And, by God, film was expensive.

00:06:11.504 --> 00:06:16.284
They didn't take 300 shots of you
in that rapid-fire digital video mode

00:06:16.308 --> 00:06:20.040
and then pick out the nicest,
smiliest one for the Christmas card.

00:06:20.927 --> 00:06:22.121
Oh, no.

00:06:23.134 --> 00:06:25.009
They dressed you up, they lined you up,

00:06:25.033 --> 00:06:27.830
and you smiled for the fucking camera
like they told you to

00:06:27.854 --> 00:06:30.039
or you could kiss
your birthday party goodbye.

00:06:30.063 --> 00:06:33.607
But still, I have a huge pile
of fake happy childhood pictures

00:06:33.631 --> 00:06:37.585
and I'm glad they make me less likely
than some people to get a divorce.

00:06:38.355 --> 00:06:41.830
So, what else can you do
to safeguard your marriage?

00:06:42.523 --> 00:06:45.770
Do not win an Oscar for best actress.

00:06:45.794 --> 00:06:47.611
(Laughter)

00:06:47.635 --> 00:06:48.829
I'm serious.

00:06:48.853 --> 00:06:51.895
Bettie Davis, Joan Crawford,
Halle Berry, Hilary Swank,

00:06:51.919 --> 00:06:54.105
Sandra Bullock, Reese Witherspoon --

00:06:54.129 --> 00:06:57.661
all of them single,
soon after taking home that statue.

00:06:57.685 --> 00:07:00.051
They actually call it the Oscar curse.

00:07:00.075 --> 00:07:03.657
It is the marriage kiss of death
and something that should be avoided.

00:07:04.718 --> 00:07:08.740
And it's not just successfully
starring in films that's dangerous.

00:07:08.764 --> 00:07:12.671
It turns out, merely watching
a romantic comedy

00:07:12.695 --> 00:07:15.814
causes relationship
satisfaction to plummet.

00:07:15.838 --> 00:07:17.288
(Laughter)

00:07:17.312 --> 00:07:23.181
Apparently, the bitter realization
that maybe it could happen to us,

00:07:23.205 --> 00:07:25.817
but it obviously hasn't
and it probably never will,

00:07:25.841 --> 00:07:29.445
makes our lives seem
unbearably grim in comparison.

00:07:29.817 --> 00:07:31.238
And theoretically,

00:07:31.262 --> 00:07:34.527
I suppose if we opt for a film
where someone gets brutally murdered

00:07:34.551 --> 00:07:36.949
or dies in a fiery car crash,

00:07:36.973 --> 00:07:39.117
we are more likely to walk out
of that theater

00:07:39.141 --> 00:07:41.079
feeling like we've got it pretty good.

00:07:41.103 --> 00:07:42.663
(Laughter)

00:07:43.172 --> 00:07:47.367
Drinking alcohol, it seems,
is bad for your marriage.

00:07:48.442 --> 00:07:49.614
Yeah.

00:07:50.356 --> 00:07:52.224
I can't tell you anymore about that one

00:07:52.248 --> 00:07:54.363
because I stopped reading it
at the headline.

00:07:54.387 --> 00:07:57.725
But here's a scary one:
divorce is contagious.

00:07:58.671 --> 00:08:01.485
That's right, when you have
a close couple friend split up,

00:08:01.509 --> 00:08:06.011
it increases your chances
of getting a divorce by 75 percent.

00:08:07.023 --> 00:08:09.731
Now, I have to say,
I don't get this one at all.

00:08:10.213 --> 00:08:14.873
My husband and I have watched
quite a few friends divide their assets

00:08:14.897 --> 00:08:19.511
and then struggle
with being our age and single

00:08:19.535 --> 00:08:23.847
in an age of sexting
and Viagra and eHarmony.

00:08:24.362 --> 00:08:26.760
And I'm thinking they've done
more for my marriage

00:08:26.784 --> 00:08:28.934
than a lifetime of therapy ever could.

00:08:29.794 --> 00:08:34.487
So now you may be wondering:
Why does anyone get married ever?

00:08:35.478 --> 00:08:40.629
Well, the US federal government
counts more than a thousand legal benefits

00:08:40.653 --> 00:08:42.014
to being someone's spouse.

00:08:42.505 --> 00:08:45.183
A list that includes
visitation rights in jail,

00:08:45.207 --> 00:08:47.461
but hopefully, you'll never need that one.

00:08:47.612 --> 00:08:50.773
But beyond the profound federal perks,

00:08:51.860 --> 00:08:53.513
married people make more money.

00:08:54.267 --> 00:08:57.533
We're healthier,
physically and emotionally.

00:08:58.398 --> 00:09:02.779
We produce happier, more stable
and more successful kids.

00:09:03.906 --> 00:09:08.021
We have more sex than our supposedly
swinging single friends,

00:09:08.045 --> 00:09:09.237
believe it or not.

00:09:09.783 --> 00:09:10.976
We even live longer,

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:16.155
which is a pretty compelling argument
for marrying someone you like a lot

00:09:16.179 --> 00:09:17.403
in the first place.

00:09:17.427 --> 00:09:18.436
(Laughter)

00:09:18.460 --> 00:09:24.440
Now, if you're not currently experiencing
the joy of the joint tax return,

00:09:24.464 --> 00:09:27.958
I can't tell you how to find
a chore-loving person

00:09:27.982 --> 00:09:30.385
of the approximately ideal size
and attractiveness,

00:09:30.409 --> 00:09:31.687
who prefers horror movies

00:09:31.711 --> 00:09:34.876
and doesn't have a lot of friends
hovering on the brink of divorce,

00:09:34.900 --> 00:09:36.976
but I can only encourage you to try,

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.844
because the benefits, as I've pointed out,

00:09:39.868 --> 00:09:41.018
are significant.

00:09:41.928 --> 00:09:45.174
The bottom line is: whether you're in it
or you're searching for it,

00:09:45.198 --> 00:09:49.607
I believe marriage is an institution
worth pursuing and protecting.

00:09:50.448 --> 00:09:53.133
So I hope you'll use the information
I've given you today

00:09:53.157 --> 00:09:56.185
to weigh your personal strengths
against your own risk factors.

00:09:56.695 --> 00:10:00.384
For instance, in my marriage,
I'd say I'm doing OK.

00:10:01.329 --> 00:10:02.726
One the one hand,

00:10:02.750 --> 00:10:06.810
I have a husband who's annoyingly lean
and incredibly handsome.

00:10:07.217 --> 00:10:09.570
So I'm obviously going
to need fatten him up.

00:10:10.122 --> 00:10:12.849
And like I said, we have
those divorced friends

00:10:12.873 --> 00:10:16.234
who may secretly or subconsciously
be trying to break us up.

00:10:16.726 --> 00:10:18.851
So we have to keep an eye on that.

00:10:20.201 --> 00:10:22.094
And we do like a cocktail or two.

00:10:22.848 --> 00:10:24.237
On the other hand,

00:10:24.261 --> 00:10:26.504
I have the fake happy picture thing.

00:10:26.528 --> 00:10:30.143
And also, my husband does
a lot around the house,

00:10:30.167 --> 00:10:33.762
and would happily never see
another romantic comedy

00:10:33.786 --> 00:10:35.032
as long as he lives.

00:10:35.056 --> 00:10:37.281
So I've got all those things going for me.

00:10:37.658 --> 00:10:38.878
But just in case,

00:10:38.902 --> 00:10:44.275
I plan to work extra hard
to not win an Oscar anytime soon.

00:10:44.636 --> 00:10:46.704
And for the good of your relationships,

00:10:46.728 --> 00:10:48.654
I would encourage you to do the same.

00:10:49.611 --> 00:10:50.877
I'll see you at the bar.

00:10:50.901 --> 00:10:52.072
(Laughter)

00:10:52.096 --> 00:10:54.976
(Applause)
