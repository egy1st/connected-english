00:00:00.349 --> 00:00:04.873
I would like to talk to you
about why many ehealth projects fail.

00:00:04.897 --> 00:00:07.618
And I really think
that the most important thing of it

00:00:07.642 --> 00:00:09.976
is that we stopped listening to patients.

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:12.617
And one thing we did at Radboud University

00:00:12.641 --> 00:00:14.652
is we appointed a Chief Listening Officer.

00:00:14.676 --> 00:00:16.283
Not in a very scientific way --

00:00:16.307 --> 00:00:19.668
she puts up a little cup
of coffee or a cup of tea

00:00:19.692 --> 00:00:22.335
and asks patients, family, relatives,

00:00:22.359 --> 00:00:23.522
"What's up?

00:00:23.546 --> 00:00:25.053
How could we help you?"

00:00:25.463 --> 00:00:27.107
And we think, we like to think,

00:00:27.131 --> 00:00:28.960
that this is one of the major problems

00:00:28.984 --> 00:00:31.112
why all -- maybe not all --

00:00:31.136 --> 00:00:32.976
but most of the ehealth projects fail,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.555
since we stopped listening.

00:00:35.206 --> 00:00:36.509
This is my weight scale.

00:00:36.876 --> 00:00:39.749
It's a very simple thing.
It's got one knob, on/off.

00:00:40.057 --> 00:00:42.098
And every morning I hop on it.

00:00:42.848 --> 00:00:44.775
And yes, I've got a challenge,

00:00:44.799 --> 00:00:45.975
as you might see.

00:00:46.629 --> 00:00:49.242
And I put my challenge on 95 kg.

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:52.212
But the thing is that
it's made this simple

00:00:52.236 --> 00:00:53.827
that whenever I hop on,

00:00:53.851 --> 00:00:56.438
it sends my data to Google Health as well.

00:00:57.291 --> 00:01:00.553
And it's collected
by my general practitioner as well,

00:01:00.577 --> 00:01:03.976
so he can see what's my problem in weight,

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.677
not on the very moment
that I need cardiologic support

00:01:07.701 --> 00:01:08.892
or something like it,

00:01:08.916 --> 00:01:10.976
but also looking backward.

00:01:11.574 --> 00:01:12.934
But there's another thing.

00:01:12.958 --> 00:01:14.437
As some of you might know,

00:01:14.461 --> 00:01:16.787
I've got more than 4000
followers on Twitter.

00:01:16.811 --> 00:01:20.429
So every morning, I hop on my weight scale

00:01:20.453 --> 00:01:21.717
and before I'm in my car,

00:01:21.741 --> 00:01:23.050
people start talking to me,

00:01:23.074 --> 00:01:25.372
"I think you need
a light lunch today, Lucien."

00:01:25.396 --> 00:01:26.547
(Laughter)

00:01:26.571 --> 00:01:28.714
But that's the nicest thing
that could happen,

00:01:28.738 --> 00:01:30.293
since this is peer pressure.

00:01:30.317 --> 00:01:33.286
Peer pressure used to help patients --

00:01:34.001 --> 00:01:35.843
since this could be used for obesity,

00:01:35.867 --> 00:01:39.460
it could be used
to stop patients from smoking.

00:01:39.484 --> 00:01:40.723
But on the other hand,

00:01:40.747 --> 00:01:44.280
it also could be used
to get people out of their chairs

00:01:44.304 --> 00:01:47.930
and try to work together
in some kind of gaming activity

00:01:47.954 --> 00:01:50.202
to get more control of their health.

00:01:50.226 --> 00:01:52.976
As of next week,
it will soon be available,

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.314
there will be this little
blood-pressure meter

00:01:55.338 --> 00:01:57.976
connected to an iPhone
or something or other.

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:01.328
And people will be able, from their homes,

00:02:01.352 --> 00:02:02.908
to take their blood pressure,

00:02:02.932 --> 00:02:04.621
send it to their doctor

00:02:04.645 --> 00:02:07.331
and eventually share it
with others, for instance,

00:02:07.355 --> 00:02:09.262
for over a 100 dollars.

00:02:09.286 --> 00:02:12.255
And this is the point
where patients get into position

00:02:12.279 --> 00:02:15.239
and can collect,
not only their own control again,

00:02:15.263 --> 00:02:17.184
be captain of their own ship,

00:02:17.208 --> 00:02:19.525
but also can help us in health care

00:02:19.549 --> 00:02:21.527
due to the challenges that we face,

00:02:21.551 --> 00:02:24.389
like health-care cost explosion,

00:02:24.413 --> 00:02:26.260
doubled demand and things like that,

00:02:26.284 --> 00:02:28.466
make techniques that are easy to use

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:31.834
and start with this
to embrace patients in the team.

00:02:31.858 --> 00:02:34.119
And you can do this
with techniques like this,

00:02:34.143 --> 00:02:35.681
but also by crowdsourcing.

00:02:36.112 --> 00:02:37.715
And one of the things we did,

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:41.066
that I would like to share with you
introduced by a little video.

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:44.553
(Music)

00:03:48.835 --> 00:03:53.057
(Heart-beat)

00:03:53.081 --> 00:03:55.717
We've all got
navigation controls in our car.

00:03:55.741 --> 00:03:57.976
We maybe even have it in our cellphone.

00:03:58.403 --> 00:04:00.772
We perfectly know where all the ATMs are,

00:04:00.796 --> 00:04:02.705
just about the city of Maastricht.

00:04:02.729 --> 00:04:05.765
The other thing is we know
where all the gas stations are.

00:04:05.789 --> 00:04:08.221
And sure, we could find fast food chains.

00:04:08.869 --> 00:04:13.046
But where would be the nearest AED
to help this patient?

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:14.943
We asked around, and nobody knew.

00:04:15.671 --> 00:04:18.582
Nobody knew where
the nearest lifesaving AED

00:04:18.606 --> 00:04:20.205
was to be obtained right now.

00:04:20.686 --> 00:04:23.118
So what we did,
we crowdsourced the Netherlands.

00:04:23.142 --> 00:04:25.822
We set up a website, and asked the crowd,

00:04:25.846 --> 00:04:28.158
"If you see an AED, please submit it,

00:04:28.182 --> 00:04:30.976
tell us where it is,
tell us when it's open,"

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.962
since sometimes in office hours
it's closed, of course.

00:04:33.986 --> 00:04:36.162
And over 10,000 AEDs in the Netherlands

00:04:36.186 --> 00:04:37.624
already have been submitted.

00:04:37.648 --> 00:04:40.545
The next step we took
was to find the applications for it.

00:04:40.569 --> 00:04:42.205
And we built an iPad application.

00:04:42.645 --> 00:04:45.670
We made an application
for Layar: Augmented Reality,

00:04:45.694 --> 00:04:47.438
to find these AEDs.

00:04:47.462 --> 00:04:49.745
And whenever you are
in a city like Maastricht,

00:04:49.769 --> 00:04:52.369
and somebody collapses,
you can use your iPhone,

00:04:52.393 --> 00:04:55.939
and within the next weeks
also your Microsoft cellphone,

00:04:55.963 --> 00:04:57.378
to find the nearest AED,

00:04:57.402 --> 00:04:58.932
which can save lives.

00:04:59.432 --> 00:05:00.736
And as of today,

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:03.454
we would like to introduce this,
not only as AED4EU,

00:05:03.478 --> 00:05:05.193
which is what the product is called,

00:05:05.217 --> 00:05:06.976
but also AED4US.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.520
And we would like to start this
on a worldwide level.

00:05:09.544 --> 00:05:12.487
And ask all of our colleagues
in the rest of the world,

00:05:12.511 --> 00:05:14.558
colleague universities, to help us

00:05:14.582 --> 00:05:17.206
to find and work and act like a hub

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:20.560
to crowdsource all these AEDs
all around the world,

00:05:20.584 --> 00:05:23.549
that whenever you're on holiday
and somebody collapses,

00:05:23.573 --> 00:05:27.054
might it be your own relative
or someone just in front of you,

00:05:27.078 --> 00:05:28.651
you can find this.

00:05:28.675 --> 00:05:30.390
The other thing we would like to ask

00:05:30.414 --> 00:05:32.489
is of companies also all over the world

00:05:32.513 --> 00:05:35.546
that will be able to help us
validate these AEDs.

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:37.388
These might be courier services

00:05:37.412 --> 00:05:39.103
or cable guys, for instance,

00:05:39.127 --> 00:05:41.489
just to see whether
the AED that is submitted

00:05:41.513 --> 00:05:43.079
is still in place.

00:05:43.103 --> 00:05:44.976
So please help us on this one

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.952
and try to make not only
health a little bit better,

00:05:47.976 --> 00:05:49.144
but take control of it.

00:05:49.168 --> 00:05:50.334
Thank you.

00:05:50.358 --> 00:05:52.444
(Applause)
