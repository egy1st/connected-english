00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
The humanitarian model has barely changed

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
since the early 20th century.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Its origins are firmly rooted

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
in the analog age.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
And there is a major shift coming on the horizon.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
The catalyst for this change

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
was the major earthquake that struck Haiti

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
on the 12th of January in 2010.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Haiti was a game changer.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
The earthquake destroyed the capital of Port-au-Prince,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
claiming the lives of some 320,000 people,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
rendering homeless

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
about 1.2 million people.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Government institutions were completely decapitated,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
including the presidential palace.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
I remember standing

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
on the roof of the Ministry of Justice

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
in downtown Port-au-Prince.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
It was about two meters high,

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
completely squashed

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
by the violence of the earthquake.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
For those of us on the ground in those early days,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
it was clear for even the most disaster-hardened veterans

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
that Haiti was something different.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
Haiti was something we hadn't seen before.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
But Haiti provided us with something else unprecedented.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
Haiti allowed us to glimpse into a future

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
of what disaster response might look like

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
in a hyper-connected world

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
where people have access

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
to mobile smart devices.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
Because out of the urban devastation

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
in Port-au-Prince

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
came a torrent of SMS texts --

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
people crying for help,

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
beseeching us for assistance,

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
sharing data, offering support,

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
looking for their loved ones.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
This was a situation

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
that traditional aid agencies had never before encountered.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
We were in one of the poorest countries on the planet,

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
but 80 percent of the people

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
had mobile devices in their hands.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
And we were unprepared for this,

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
and they were shaping the aid effort.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000
Outside Haiti also, things were looking different.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
Tens of thousands of so-called digital volunteers

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
were scouring the Internet,

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
converting tweets

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
that had already been converted from texts

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
and putting these into open-source maps,

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
layering them with all sorts of important information --

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000
people like Crisis Mappers and Open Street Map --

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
and putting these on the Web for everybody --

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
the media, the aid organizations and the communities themselves --

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
to participate in and to use.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
Back in Haiti,

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
people were increasingly turning

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
to the medium of SMS.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
People that were hungry and hurting

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
were signaling their distress,

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000
were signaling their need for help.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000
On street sides all over Port-au-Prince,

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
entrepreneurs sprung up

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
offering mobile phone charging stations.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
They understood more than we did

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
people's innate need

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
to be connected.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
Never having been confronted

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
with this type of situation before,

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
we wanted to try and understand

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
how we could tap into this incredible resource,

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
how we could really leverage

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
this incredible use of mobile technology

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
and SMS technology.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.000
We started talking with a local telecom provider called VoilÃ ,

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.000
which is a subsidiary of Trilogy International.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
We had basically three requirements.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000
We wanted to communicate

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000
in a two-way form of communication.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.000
We didn't want to shout; we needed to listen as well.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000
We wanted to be able to target

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
specific geographic communities.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
We didn't need to talk to the whole country at the same time.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000
And we wanted it to be easy to use.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000
Out of this rubble of Haiti and from this devastation

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000
came something that we call TERA --

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.000
the Trilogy Emergency Response Application --

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000
which has been used to support the aid effort

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000
ever since.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000
It has been used to help communities prepare for disasters.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.000
It has been used to signal early warning

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000
in advance of weather-related disasters.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.000
It's used for public health awareness campaigns

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000
such as the prevention of cholera.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000
And it is even used for sensitive issues

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000
such as building awareness

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000
around gender-based violence.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.000
But does it work?

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000
We have just published

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.000
an evaluation of this program,

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.000
and the evidence that is there for all to see

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.000
is quite remarkable.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000
Some 74 percent of people

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000
received the data.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.000
Those who were intended to receive the data,

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000
74 percent of them received it.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000
96 percent of them

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000
found it useful.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.000
83 percent of them took action --

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000
evidence that it is indeed empowering.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.000
And 73 percent of them shared it.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000
The TERA system

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000
was developed from Haiti

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.000
with support of engineers in the region.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000
It is a user-appropriate technology

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.000
that has been used for humanitarian good to great effect.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.000
Technology is transformational.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000
Right across the developing world,

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000
citizens and communities

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000
are using technology

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000
to enable them to bring about change, positive change,

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000
in their own communities.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000
The grassroots has been strengthened

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000
through the social power of sharing

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000
and they are challenging the old models,

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000
the old analog models

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.000
of control and command.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.000
One illustration of the transformational power of technology

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000
is in Kibera.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000
Kibera is one of Africa's largest slums.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000
It's on the outskirts of Nairobi,

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000
the capital city of Kenya.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000
It's home to an unknown number of people --

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000
some say between 250,000

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.000
and 1.2 million.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.000
If you were to arrive in Nairobi today

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000
and pick up a tourist map,

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000
Kibera is represented

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000
as a lush, green national park

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000
devoid of human settlement.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000
Young people living in Kibera

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000
in their community,

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.000
with simple handheld devices,

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:53.000
GPS handheld devices and SMS-enabled mobile phones,

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.000
have literally put themselves on the map.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000
They have collated crowd-sourced data

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.000
and rendered the invisible visible.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000
People like Josh and Steve

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.000
are continuing to layer information upon information,

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.000
real-time information, Tweet it and text it onto these maps

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.000
for all to use.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.000
You can find out about the latest impromptu music session.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.000
You can find out about the latest security incident.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.000
You can find out about places of worship.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000
You can find out about the health centers.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000
You can feel the dynamism

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000
of this living, breathing community.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.000
They also have their own news network on YouTube

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.000
with 36,000 viewers at the moment.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.000
They're showing us what can be done

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.000
with mobile, digital technologies.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.000
They're showing that the magic of technology

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000
can bring the invisible visible.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.000
And they are giving a voice to themselves.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.000
They are telling their own story,

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.000
bypassing the official narrative.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:49.000
And we're seeing from all points on the globe similar stories.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000
In Mongolia for instance,

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000
where 30 percent of the people are nomadic,

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.000
SMS information systems are being used

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.000
to track migration and weather patterns.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000
SMS is even used

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000
to hold herder summits

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000
from remote participation.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.000
And if people are migrating

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.000
into urban, unfamiliar, concrete environments,

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.000
they can also be helped in anticipation

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.000
with social supporters ready and waiting for them

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000
based on SMS knowledge.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.000
In Nigeria,

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.000
open-source SMS tools

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:23.000
are being used by the Red Cross community workers

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:26.000
to gather information from the local community

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.000
in an attempt to better understand and mitigate

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000
the prevalence of malaria.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.000
My colleague, Jason Peat, who runs this program,

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:36.000
tells me it's 10 times faster and 10 times cheaper

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.000
than the traditional way of doing things.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.000
And not only is it empowering to the communities,

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.000
but really importantly,

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.000
this information stays in the community

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.000
where it is needed to formulate long-term health polices.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.000
We are on a planet

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:54.000
of seven billion people,

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.000
five billion mobile subscriptions.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.000
By 2015,

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:03.000
there will be three billion smartphones in the world.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.000
The U.N. broadband commission

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.000
has recently set targets

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.000
to help broadband access

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:13.000
in 50 percent of the Developing World,

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.000
compared to 20 percent today.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.000
We are hurtling towards a hyper-connected world

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:21.000
where citizens from all cultures and all social strata

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:25.000
will have access to smart, fast mobile devices.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.000
People are understanding,

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.000
from Cairo to Oakland,

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000
that there are new ways to come together,

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.000
there are new ways to mobilize,

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.000
there are new ways to influence.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:40.000
A transformation is coming which needs to be understood

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:43.000
by the humanitarian structures and humanitarian models.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.000
The collective voices of people

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:48.000
needs to be more integrated through new technologies

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000
into the organizational strategies and plans of actions

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.000
and not just recycled

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.000
for fundraising or marketing.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.000
We need to, for example, embrace

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.000
the big data,

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.000
the knowledge that is there from market leaders

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000
who understand what it means

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:05.000
to use and leverage big data.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:08.000
One idea that I'd like you to consider, for instance,

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:11.000
is to take a look at our IT departments.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:14.000
They're normally backroom or basement hardware service providers,

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:17.000
but they need to be elevated to software strategists.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.000
We need people in our organizations

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.000
who know what it's like to work with big data.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.000
We need technology

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.000
as a core organizational principle.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:28.000
We need technological strategists in the boardroom

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.000
who can ask and answer the question,

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.000
"What would Amazon or Google

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.000
do with all of this data?"

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.000
and convert it to humanitarian good.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.000
The possibilities

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.000
that new digital technologies are bringing

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:44.000
can help humanitarian organizations,

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.000
not only ensure

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.000
that people's right to information is met,

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:51.000
or that they have their right to communicate,

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.000
but I think in the future,

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:56.000
humanitarian organizations will also have to anticipate

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.000
the right for people to access

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.000
critical communication technologies

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.000
in order to ensure

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.000
that their voices are heard,

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.000
that they're truly participating,

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:09.000
that they're truly empowered in the humanitarian world.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:12.000
It has always been the elusive ideal

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:15.000
to ensure full participation of people affected by disasters

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:18.000
in the humanitarian effort.

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:21.000
We now have the tools. We now have the possibilities.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:25.000
There are no more reasons not to do it.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:28.000
I believe we need to bring the humanitarian world

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.000
from analog to digital.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.000
Thank you very much.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:36.000
