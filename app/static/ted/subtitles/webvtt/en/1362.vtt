WEBVTT

00:00:00.428 --> 00:00:05.709
The world's largest and most devastating
environmental and industrial project

00:00:05.733 --> 00:00:09.574
is situated in the heart of the largest
and most intact forest in the world,

00:00:09.598 --> 00:00:11.402
Canada's boreal forest.

00:00:11.426 --> 00:00:15.849
It stretches right across
Northern Canada, in Labrador,

00:00:15.873 --> 00:00:19.046
it's home to the largest remaining
wild caribou herd in the world:

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:20.541
the George River caribou herd,

00:00:20.565 --> 00:00:22.734
numbering approximately 400,000 animals.

00:00:22.758 --> 00:00:25.616
Unfortunately, when I was there,
I couldn't find one of them,

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:27.518
but you have the antlers as proof.

00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:29.327
All across the boreal,

00:00:29.351 --> 00:00:32.745
we're blessed with this incredible
abundance of wetlands.

00:00:32.769 --> 00:00:36.769
Wetlands, globally, are one
of the most endangered ecosystems.

00:00:37.126 --> 00:00:40.008
They're absolutely critical ecosystems,

00:00:40.032 --> 00:00:42.613
they clean air, they clean water,

00:00:42.637 --> 00:00:45.706
they sequester large amounts
of greenhouse gases,

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:49.131
and they're home
to a huge diversity of species.

00:00:49.155 --> 00:00:51.512
In the boreal, they are also the home

00:00:51.536 --> 00:00:55.887
where almost 50 percent of the 800 bird
species found in North America

00:00:55.911 --> 00:00:58.468
migrate north to breed
and raise their young.

00:01:00.571 --> 00:01:05.580
In Ontario, the boreal marches down south
to the north shore of Lake Superior.

00:01:06.032 --> 00:01:09.545
And these incredibly
beautiful boreal forests

00:01:09.569 --> 00:01:13.514
were the inspiration for some of the most
famous art in Canadian history,

00:01:13.538 --> 00:01:17.868
the Group of Seven
were very inspired by this landscape,

00:01:17.892 --> 00:01:23.250
and so the boreal is not just a really key
part of our natural heritage,

00:01:23.274 --> 00:01:26.033
but also an important part
of our cultural heritage.

00:01:26.566 --> 00:01:30.514
In Manitoba, this is an image
from the east side of Lake Winnipeg,

00:01:30.538 --> 00:01:35.293
and this is the home of the newly
designated UNESCO Cultural Heritage site.

00:01:36.531 --> 00:01:39.549
In Saskatchewan,
as across all of the boreal,

00:01:39.573 --> 00:01:41.986
home to some of our most famous rivers,

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:47.066
an incredible network of rivers and lakes
that every school-age child learns about,

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:50.883
the Peace, the Athabasca,
the Churchill here, the Mackenzie,

00:01:51.019 --> 00:01:54.850
and these networks
were the historical routes

00:01:54.874 --> 00:01:57.098
for the voyageur and the coureur de bois,

00:01:57.122 --> 00:02:00.429
the first non-aboriginal
explorers of Northern Canada

00:02:00.453 --> 00:02:03.212
that, taking from
the First Nations people,

00:02:03.236 --> 00:02:05.616
used canoes and paddled to explore

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:09.350
for a trade route,
a Northwest Passage for the fur trade.

00:02:09.954 --> 00:02:13.585
In the North, the boreal
is bordered by the tundra,

00:02:13.609 --> 00:02:16.632
and just below that, in Yukon,

00:02:16.656 --> 00:02:20.134
we have this incredible valley,
the Tombstone Valley.

00:02:20.158 --> 00:02:24.844
And the Tombstone Valley is home
to the Porcupine caribou herd.

00:02:24.868 --> 00:02:27.586
Now you've probably heard
about the Porcupine caribou herd

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:31.162
in the context of its breeding ground
in Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.

00:02:31.186 --> 00:02:33.408
Well, the wintering ground
is also critical

00:02:33.432 --> 00:02:36.033
and it also is not protected,

00:02:36.057 --> 00:02:41.188
and is potentially, could be potentially,
exploited for gas and mineral rights.

00:02:42.855 --> 00:02:45.309
The western border of the boreal
in British Columbia

00:02:45.333 --> 00:02:46.950
is marked by the Coast Mountains,

00:02:46.974 --> 00:02:48.945
and on the other side of those mountains

00:02:48.969 --> 00:02:51.797
is the greatest remaining
temperate rainforest in the world,

00:02:51.821 --> 00:02:53.163
the Great Bear Rainforest,

00:02:53.187 --> 00:02:56.047
and we'll discuss that in a few minutes
in a bit more detail.

00:02:56.071 --> 00:02:57.501
All across the boreal,

00:02:57.525 --> 00:03:02.519
it's home for a huge incredible range
of indigenous peoples,

00:03:02.543 --> 00:03:05.129
and a rich and varied culture.

00:03:05.616 --> 00:03:08.122
And I think that one of the reasons

00:03:08.146 --> 00:03:11.620
why so many of these groups have
retained a link to the past,

00:03:11.644 --> 00:03:13.656
know their native languages,

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:16.018
the songs, the dances, the traditions,

00:03:16.042 --> 00:03:19.553
I think part of that reason
is because of the remoteness,

00:03:19.577 --> 00:03:20.879
the span and the wilderness

00:03:20.903 --> 00:03:24.567
of this almost 95 percent
intact ecosystem.

00:03:25.033 --> 00:03:26.643
And I think particularly now,

00:03:26.667 --> 00:03:29.799
as we see ourselves in a time
of environmental crisis,

00:03:29.823 --> 00:03:31.736
we can learn so much from these people

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:33.985
who have lived so sustainably
in this ecosystem

00:03:34.009 --> 00:03:35.823
for over 10,000 years.

00:03:37.496 --> 00:03:40.533
In the heart of this ecosystem
is the very antithesis

00:03:40.557 --> 00:03:43.036
of all of these values
that we've been talking about,

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:45.198
and I think these
are some of the core values

00:03:45.222 --> 00:03:46.900
that make us proud to be Canadians.

00:03:46.924 --> 00:03:48.740
This is the Alberta tar sands,

00:03:48.764 --> 00:03:53.366
the largest oil reserves on the planet
outside of Saudi Arabia.

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:57.286
Trapped underneath the boreal forest
and wetlands of northern Alberta

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:01.100
are these vast reserves
of this sticky, tar-like bitumen.

00:04:01.631 --> 00:04:04.217
And the mining
and the exploitation of that

00:04:04.241 --> 00:04:08.522
is creating devastation on a scale
that the planet has never seen before.

00:04:10.715 --> 00:04:14.246
I want to try to convey
some sort of a sense of the size of this.

00:04:14.889 --> 00:04:16.836
If you look at that truck there,

00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:19.276
it is the largest truck
of its kind on the planet.

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:22.046
It is a 400-ton-capacity dump truck

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:29.070
and its dimensions are 45 feet long
by 35 feet wide and 25 feet high.

00:04:29.254 --> 00:04:30.690
If I stand beside that truck,

00:04:30.714 --> 00:04:34.125
my head comes to around the bottom
of the yellow part of that hubcap.

00:04:34.616 --> 00:04:36.685
Within the dimensions of that truck,

00:04:36.709 --> 00:04:40.974
you could build a 3,000-square-foot
two-story home quite easily.

00:04:40.998 --> 00:04:42.203
I did the math.

00:04:42.553 --> 00:04:47.407
So instead of thinking of that as a truck,
think of that as a 3,000-square-foot home.

00:04:47.802 --> 00:04:49.698
That's not a bad size home.

00:04:49.722 --> 00:04:53.079
And line those trucks / homes
back and forth

00:04:53.103 --> 00:04:57.348
across there from the bottom
all the way to the top.

00:04:57.993 --> 00:05:03.070
And then think of how large
that very small section of one mine is.

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:07.246
Now, you can apply that same kind
of thinking here as well.

00:05:07.492 --> 00:05:10.201
Now, here you see --
of course, as you go further on,

00:05:10.225 --> 00:05:11.872
these trucks become like a pixel.

00:05:12.505 --> 00:05:15.607
Again, imagine those
all back and forth there.

00:05:15.921 --> 00:05:18.041
How large is that one portion of a mine?

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:24.126
That would be a huge,
vast metropolitan area,

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:26.502
probably much larger
than the city of Victoria.

00:05:26.526 --> 00:05:30.352
And this is just one of a number of mines,

00:05:30.376 --> 00:05:32.560
10 mines so far right now.

00:05:32.584 --> 00:05:35.190
This is one section of one mining complex,

00:05:35.214 --> 00:05:39.053
and there are about another 40 or 50
in the approval process.

00:05:39.077 --> 00:05:41.837
No tar sands mine has actually
ever been denied approval,

00:05:41.861 --> 00:05:43.866
so it is essentially a rubber stamp.

00:05:45.498 --> 00:05:48.439
The other method of extraction
is what's called the in situ.

00:05:48.463 --> 00:05:50.435
And here, massive amounts of water

00:05:50.459 --> 00:05:53.466
are superheated and pumped
through the ground,

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:55.578
through these vasts networks of pipelines,

00:05:55.602 --> 00:05:59.292
seismic lines, drill paths,
compressor stations.

00:05:59.316 --> 00:06:03.459
And even though this looks
maybe not quite as repugnant as the mines,

00:06:03.483 --> 00:06:05.660
it's even more damaging in some ways.

00:06:05.684 --> 00:06:11.059
It impacts and fragments
a larger part of the wilderness,

00:06:11.083 --> 00:06:13.545
where there is 90 percent
reduction of key species,

00:06:13.569 --> 00:06:15.886
like woodland caribou and grizzly bears,

00:06:15.910 --> 00:06:19.418
and it consumes
even more energy, more water,

00:06:19.442 --> 00:06:21.995
and produces at least
as much greenhouse gas.

00:06:22.019 --> 00:06:28.011
So these in situ developments are at least
as ecologically damaging as the mines.

00:06:29.717 --> 00:06:32.358
The oil produced from either method

00:06:32.382 --> 00:06:36.934
produces more greenhouse gas
emissions than any other oil.

00:06:36.958 --> 00:06:40.222
This is one of the reasons
why it's called the world's dirtiest oil.

00:06:40.596 --> 00:06:41.949
It's also one of the reasons

00:06:41.973 --> 00:06:47.169
why it is the largest and fastest-growing
single source of carbon in Canada,

00:06:47.193 --> 00:06:52.115
and it is also a reason
why Canada is now number three

00:06:52.139 --> 00:06:55.095
in terms of producing carbon per person.

00:06:56.778 --> 00:07:00.975
The tailings ponds are the largest toxic
impoundments on the planet.

00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:04.872
Oil sands -- or rather,
I should say tar sands --

00:07:04.896 --> 00:07:07.181
oil sands is a PR-created term

00:07:07.205 --> 00:07:10.264
so that the oil companies
wouldn't be trying to promote something

00:07:10.288 --> 00:07:14.291
that sounds like a sticky tar-like
substance that's the world's dirtiest oil.

00:07:14.709 --> 00:07:16.582
So they decided to call it oil sands.

00:07:17.106 --> 00:07:20.928
The tar sands consume more water
than any other oil process,

00:07:20.952 --> 00:07:24.239
three to five barrels of water
are taken, polluted

00:07:24.263 --> 00:07:26.559
and then returned into tailings ponds,

00:07:26.583 --> 00:07:28.765
the largest toxic
impoundments on the planet.

00:07:29.084 --> 00:07:33.164
SemCrude, just one of the licensees,
in just one of their tailings ponds,

00:07:33.188 --> 00:07:37.941
dumps 250,000 tons
of this toxic gunk every single day.

00:07:38.739 --> 00:07:42.732
That's creating the largest toxic
impoundments in the history of the planet.

00:07:42.756 --> 00:07:47.720
So far, this is enough toxin to cover
the face of Lake Erie a foot deep.

00:07:49.685 --> 00:07:53.926
And the tailings ponds
range in size up to 9,000 acres.

00:07:54.592 --> 00:07:58.073
That's two-thirds the size
of the entire island of Manhattan.

00:07:58.565 --> 00:08:01.534
That's like from Wall Street
at the southern edge of Manhattan

00:08:01.558 --> 00:08:03.398
up to maybe 120th Street.

00:08:04.171 --> 00:08:08.174
So this is one of the larger
tailings ponds.

00:08:08.198 --> 00:08:11.241
This might be, what? I don't know,
half the size of Manhattan.

00:08:11.265 --> 00:08:12.758
And you can see in the context,

00:08:12.782 --> 00:08:17.128
it's just a relatively small section
of one of 10 mining complexes

00:08:17.152 --> 00:08:20.605
and another 40 to 50
on stream to be approved soon.

00:08:22.398 --> 00:08:24.954
And of course, these tailings ponds --

00:08:24.978 --> 00:08:27.533
well, you can't see
many ponds from outer space

00:08:27.557 --> 00:08:31.388
and you can see these, so maybe
we should stop calling them ponds --

00:08:31.412 --> 00:08:35.216
these massive toxic wastelands are built

00:08:35.240 --> 00:08:37.886
unlined and on the banks
of the Athabasca River.

00:08:38.562 --> 00:08:42.375
And the Athabasca River drains downstream
to a range of aboriginal communities.

00:08:42.971 --> 00:08:47.285
In Fort Chipewyan, the 800 people there,
are finding toxins in the food chain,

00:08:47.309 --> 00:08:49.172
this has been scientifically proven.

00:08:49.719 --> 00:08:51.738
The tar sands toxins
are in the food chain,

00:08:51.762 --> 00:08:54.673
and this is causing cancer
rates up to 10 times

00:08:54.697 --> 00:08:56.765
what they are in the rest of Canada.

00:08:57.767 --> 00:09:03.025
In spite of that, people have to live,
have to eat this food in order to survive.

00:09:03.264 --> 00:09:06.279
The incredibly high price of flying food

00:09:06.303 --> 00:09:08.892
into these remote
Northern aboriginal communities

00:09:08.916 --> 00:09:10.591
and the high rate of unemployment

00:09:10.615 --> 00:09:13.151
makes this an absolute
necessity for survival.

00:09:13.709 --> 00:09:17.326
And not that many years ago,
I was lent a boat by a First Nations man,

00:09:17.813 --> 00:09:20.040
and he said, "When you
go out on the river,

00:09:20.064 --> 00:09:23.170
do not under any
circumstances eat the fish.

00:09:23.733 --> 00:09:24.883
It's carcinogenic."

00:09:25.417 --> 00:09:29.938
And yet, on the front porch
of that man's cabin,

00:09:29.962 --> 00:09:31.369
I saw four fish.

00:09:31.393 --> 00:09:33.393
He had to feed his family to survive.

00:09:34.193 --> 00:09:39.678
And as a parent, I just can't imagine
what that does to your soul.

00:09:40.354 --> 00:09:41.924
And that's what we're doing.

00:09:43.893 --> 00:09:48.295
The boreal forest
is also perhaps our best defense

00:09:48.319 --> 00:09:50.498
against global warming and climate change.

00:09:51.443 --> 00:09:55.845
The boreal forest sequesters more carbon
than any other terrestrial ecosystem.

00:09:57.322 --> 00:09:59.369
And this is absolutely key.

00:09:59.934 --> 00:10:01.804
So what we're doing is,

00:10:01.828 --> 00:10:06.386
we're taking the most concentrated
greenhouse gas sink --

00:10:07.517 --> 00:10:10.050
twice as much greenhouse
gases are sequestered

00:10:10.074 --> 00:10:13.611
in the boreal per acre
than the tropical rainforests.

00:10:14.088 --> 00:10:16.565
And what we're doing is we're destroying

00:10:16.589 --> 00:10:19.287
this carbon sink,
turning it into a carbon bomb.

00:10:19.645 --> 00:10:22.757
And we're replacing that
with the largest industrial project

00:10:22.781 --> 00:10:24.152
in the history of the world,

00:10:24.176 --> 00:10:29.679
which is producing the most high-carbon
greenhouse-gas emitting oil in the world.

00:10:30.976 --> 00:10:35.096
And we're doing this on the second largest
oil reserves on the planet.

00:10:36.183 --> 00:10:39.960
This is one of the reasons why Canada,
originally a climate change hero --

00:10:39.984 --> 00:10:43.348
we were one of the first
signatories of the Kyoto Accord.

00:10:43.372 --> 00:10:45.792
Now we're the country
that has full-time lobbyists

00:10:45.816 --> 00:10:48.027
in the European Union and Washington DC,

00:10:48.875 --> 00:10:50.774
threatening trade wars

00:10:50.798 --> 00:10:55.524
when these countries talk about wanting
to bring in positive legislation

00:10:55.548 --> 00:10:58.559
to limit the import of high-carbon fuels,

00:10:58.583 --> 00:11:01.846
of greenhouse gas emissions,
anything like this,

00:11:01.870 --> 00:11:06.384
at international conferences,
whether they're in Copenhagen or Cancun,

00:11:06.408 --> 00:11:08.904
international conferences
on climate change,

00:11:08.928 --> 00:11:12.067
we're the country that gets
the dinosaur award every single day,

00:11:12.091 --> 00:11:15.379
as being the biggest
obstacle to progress on this issue.

00:11:17.317 --> 00:11:19.723
Just 70 miles downstream

00:11:19.747 --> 00:11:23.442
is the world's largest freshwater delta,
the Peace-Athabasca Delta,

00:11:23.466 --> 00:11:27.269
the only one at the juncture
of all four migratory flyways.

00:11:27.293 --> 00:11:31.210
This is a globally significant wetland,
perhaps the greatest on the planet.

00:11:31.234 --> 00:11:34.943
Incredible habitat
for half the bird species

00:11:34.967 --> 00:11:37.706
you find in North America, migrating here.

00:11:38.611 --> 00:11:42.845
And also the last refuge
for the largest herd of wild bison,

00:11:42.869 --> 00:11:46.812
and also, of course, critical habitat
for another whole range of other species.

00:11:47.820 --> 00:11:49.949
But it too is being threatened

00:11:49.973 --> 00:11:53.613
by the massive amount of water
being drawn from the Athabasca,

00:11:53.637 --> 00:11:55.619
which feeds these wetlands,

00:11:55.643 --> 00:11:57.736
and also the incredible toxic burden

00:11:57.760 --> 00:12:00.533
of the largest toxic unlined
impoundments on the planet,

00:12:00.557 --> 00:12:04.540
which are leaching in to the food chain
for all the species downstream.

00:12:05.683 --> 00:12:09.628
So as bad as all that is, things are going
to get much worse -- much, much worse.

00:12:09.652 --> 00:12:12.363
This is the infrastructure
as we see it about now.

00:12:13.141 --> 00:12:15.792
This is what's planned for 2015.

00:12:16.110 --> 00:12:19.470
And you can see here
the Keystone Pipeline,

00:12:20.168 --> 00:12:24.395
which would take tar sands raw
down to the Gulf Coast,

00:12:24.419 --> 00:12:28.702
punching a pipeline through
the agricultural heart of North America,

00:12:28.726 --> 00:12:31.082
of the United States,

00:12:31.106 --> 00:12:36.411
and securing the contract
with the dirtiest fuel in the world

00:12:36.435 --> 00:12:39.379
by consumption of the United States,

00:12:39.403 --> 00:12:42.264
and promoting a huge disincentive

00:12:42.288 --> 00:12:45.195
to a sustainable clean-energy
future for America.

00:12:46.140 --> 00:12:50.614
Here you see the route
down the Mackenzie valley.

00:12:51.677 --> 00:12:55.339
This would put a pipeline
to take natural gas from the Beaufort Sea

00:12:55.363 --> 00:13:00.027
through the heart of the third largest
watershed basin in the world,

00:13:00.051 --> 00:13:02.589
and the only one
which is 95 percent intact.

00:13:03.231 --> 00:13:06.615
And building a pipeline
with an industrial highway

00:13:06.639 --> 00:13:10.127
would change forever
this incredible wilderness,

00:13:10.151 --> 00:13:13.101
which is a true rarity
on the planet today.

00:13:15.306 --> 00:13:19.551
So the Great Bear Rainforest
is just over the hill there,

00:13:19.575 --> 00:13:22.702
within a few miles,
we go from these dry boreal forests

00:13:22.726 --> 00:13:26.115
of 100-year-old trees,
maybe 10 inches across,

00:13:26.139 --> 00:13:28.576
and soon, we're in the coastal
temperate rainforest,

00:13:28.600 --> 00:13:32.176
rain-drenched, 1,000-year-old trees,

00:13:32.200 --> 00:13:35.254
20 feet across, a completely
different ecosystem.

00:13:35.278 --> 00:13:38.047
And the Great Bear Rainforest
is generally considered to be

00:13:38.071 --> 00:13:41.425
the largest coastal temperate rainforest
ecosystem in the world.

00:13:42.014 --> 00:13:43.820
Some of the greatest densities

00:13:43.844 --> 00:13:47.028
of some of the most iconic
and threatened species on the planet.

00:13:47.881 --> 00:13:51.404
And yet there's a proposal,
of course, to build a pipeline

00:13:52.476 --> 00:13:56.335
to take huge tankers,
10 times the size of the Exxon Valdez,

00:13:56.359 --> 00:13:59.814
through some of the most
difficult-to-navigate waters in the world,

00:13:59.838 --> 00:14:03.154
where only just a few years ago,
a BC ferry ran aground.

00:14:04.202 --> 00:14:06.555
When one of these tar sands tankers,

00:14:06.579 --> 00:14:09.941
carrying the dirtiest oil,
10 times as much as the Exxon Valdez,

00:14:09.965 --> 00:14:12.274
eventually hits a rock and goes down,

00:14:12.298 --> 00:14:15.208
we're going to have
one of the worst ecological disasters

00:14:15.232 --> 00:14:16.554
this planet has ever seen.

00:14:17.799 --> 00:14:20.879
And here we have the plan out to 2030.

00:14:20.903 --> 00:14:25.456
What they're proposing is an almost
four-times increase in production,

00:14:25.480 --> 00:14:28.755
and that would industrialize
an area the size of Florida.

00:14:30.271 --> 00:14:35.103
In doing so, we'll be removing
a large part of our greatest carbon sink

00:14:35.127 --> 00:14:40.605
and replacing it with the most high
greenhouse-gas emission oil in the future.

00:14:41.581 --> 00:14:44.653
The world does not need
any more tar mines.

00:14:45.697 --> 00:14:48.637
The world does not need any more pipelines

00:14:48.661 --> 00:14:51.248
to wed our addiction to fossil fuels.

00:14:51.841 --> 00:14:53.833
And the world certainly does not need

00:14:53.857 --> 00:14:56.910
the largest toxic impoundments
to grow and multiply

00:14:56.934 --> 00:14:59.187
and further threaten
the downstream communities.

00:14:59.211 --> 00:15:01.207
And let's face it, we all live downstream

00:15:01.231 --> 00:15:03.834
in an era of global warming
and climate change.

00:15:05.043 --> 00:15:07.801
What we need, is we all need to act

00:15:07.825 --> 00:15:12.497
to ensure that Canada respects
the massive amounts of freshwater

00:15:12.521 --> 00:15:14.165
that we hold in this country.

00:15:14.956 --> 00:15:17.281
We need to ensure
that these wetlands and forests

00:15:17.305 --> 00:15:20.587
that are our best and greatest
and most critical defense

00:15:20.611 --> 00:15:23.073
against global warming are protected,

00:15:23.097 --> 00:15:26.630
and we are not releasing
that carbon bomb into the atmosphere.

00:15:27.557 --> 00:15:32.688
And we need to all gather together
and say no to the tar sands.

00:15:32.712 --> 00:15:33.863
And we can do that.

00:15:33.887 --> 00:15:36.770
there is a huge network
all over the world,

00:15:36.794 --> 00:15:38.517
fighting to stop this project.

00:15:39.040 --> 00:15:40.834
And I quite simply think

00:15:40.858 --> 00:15:44.724
that this is not something
that should be decided just in Canada.

00:15:44.748 --> 00:15:47.028
Everyone in this room,
everyone across Canada,

00:15:47.052 --> 00:15:49.013
everyone listening to this presentation

00:15:49.037 --> 00:15:51.839
has a role to play
and, I think, a responsibility.

00:15:51.863 --> 00:15:57.498
Because what we do here
is going to change our history,

00:15:57.522 --> 00:16:00.215
it's going to color
our possibility to survive,

00:16:00.239 --> 00:16:03.630
and for our children to survive
and have a rich future.

00:16:05.749 --> 00:16:07.711
We have an incredible gift in the boreal,

00:16:07.735 --> 00:16:12.843
an incredible opportunity to preserve
our best defense against global warming,

00:16:12.987 --> 00:16:14.724
but we could let that slip away.

00:16:15.715 --> 00:16:19.400
The tar sands could threaten
not just a large section of the boreal.

00:16:19.717 --> 00:16:22.690
It compromises the life and the health

00:16:22.714 --> 00:16:27.238
of some of our most underprivileged
and vulnerable people,

00:16:27.262 --> 00:16:30.375
the aboriginal communities
that have so much to teach us.

00:16:31.131 --> 00:16:33.709
It could destroy the Athabasca Delta,

00:16:33.733 --> 00:16:37.574
the largest and possibly greatest
freshwater delta in the planet.

00:16:38.389 --> 00:16:41.958
It could destroy
the Great Bear Rainforest,

00:16:41.982 --> 00:16:44.375
the largest temperate
rainforest in the world.

00:16:44.817 --> 00:16:46.825
And it could have huge impacts

00:16:46.849 --> 00:16:50.810
on the future of the agricultural
heartland of North America.

00:16:51.337 --> 00:16:54.531
I hope that you will all,
if you've been moved by this presentation,

00:16:54.555 --> 00:16:57.334
join with the growing
international community

00:16:57.358 --> 00:17:00.804
to get Canada to step up
to its responsibilities,

00:17:00.828 --> 00:17:05.214
to convince Canada to go back
to being a climate change champion

00:17:05.238 --> 00:17:06.971
instead of a climate change villain,

00:17:06.995 --> 00:17:08.652
and to say no to the tar sands,

00:17:08.676 --> 00:17:11.345
and yes to a clean energy future for all.

00:17:11.369 --> 00:17:12.693
Thank you so much.

00:17:12.717 --> 00:17:15.804
(Applause)
