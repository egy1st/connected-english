00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:02.555
The sky is inherently democratic.

00:00:03.079 --> 00:00:07.342
It's accessible, in principle, anyway,
by anyone, everywhere,

00:00:07.366 --> 00:00:09.922
just simply by the act of looking up.

00:00:10.485 --> 00:00:13.450
But like so many
beautiful things around us,

00:00:13.474 --> 00:00:16.438
it's slipping away from us,
and we haven't even noticed,

00:00:16.462 --> 00:00:18.988
because we're honestly not really looking.

00:00:19.647 --> 00:00:21.644
So what do we look at instead?

00:00:21.668 --> 00:00:25.756
Well, we look at our phones,
we look at our computers,

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:27.453
we look at screens of all kinds.

00:00:27.477 --> 00:00:30.306
And honestly, we rarely
even take the trouble

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.678
to look up enough to see each other,

00:00:32.702 --> 00:00:36.641
let alone taking that next step
to looking up at the actual sky.

00:00:37.625 --> 00:00:42.639
Now, there's a tendency to think
that the loss of our dark night skies

00:00:42.663 --> 00:00:46.208
is the inevitable outcome
of progress, change, technology.

00:00:46.637 --> 00:00:48.710
And you know, that's just simply not true.

00:00:48.734 --> 00:00:50.462
Later on, I'll tell you why.

00:00:50.985 --> 00:00:54.615
But first, I want to tell you
about my experience of the dark night sky.

00:00:55.091 --> 00:00:59.201
I never saw a truly dark night
sky until I was 15.

00:00:59.225 --> 00:01:00.943
I was here, in Arizona.

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:04.915
I was on a road trip;
I pulled over somewhere.

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:07.726
I have no idea where I was,
except I know what state.

00:01:08.339 --> 00:01:09.736
And I looked up,

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:14.023
and the sky was just filled
with an impossible number of stars.

00:01:14.833 --> 00:01:16.952
You see, I'm from New York City,

00:01:16.976 --> 00:01:22.043
and in New York, you can see the moon,
you can see a couple of stars.

00:01:22.067 --> 00:01:25.236
More often than not, they turn out
to be airplanes when they land.

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:26.269
(Laughter)

00:01:26.293 --> 00:01:27.899
But there's really not much else.

00:01:27.923 --> 00:01:31.478
As a result, most of my colleagues
who are astronomers

00:01:31.502 --> 00:01:35.571
spent at least part of their youth
looking up at the sky in their backyard.

00:01:35.595 --> 00:01:37.560
I never really had that experience,

00:01:37.584 --> 00:01:41.380
and, as a result, I'm really
disappointing on camping trips.

00:01:41.404 --> 00:01:44.287
I don't really know many constellations.

00:01:44.311 --> 00:01:47.166
The ones I do know,
you probably know them, too.

00:01:47.926 --> 00:01:50.257
But I'll never forget that experience

00:01:50.281 --> 00:01:52.910
of the first time I saw
the dark night sky.

00:01:52.934 --> 00:01:57.012
And I was just flabbergasted
at how many stars there were.

00:01:57.036 --> 00:01:58.829
And I felt tiny.

00:01:59.923 --> 00:02:05.255
Then I also felt like,
"Where's this been hiding this whole time?

00:02:05.279 --> 00:02:07.292
Who's been hiding this sky from me?"

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:10.783
Of course, the answer is obvious
if you think about it

00:02:11.336 --> 00:02:13.435
or if you look at the picture on the left,

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:18.181
where you're seeing the same neighborhood
taken during a blackout

00:02:18.205 --> 00:02:19.628
versus on an ordinary night.

00:02:20.253 --> 00:02:23.137
You can't see the stars
if you drown them out with light.

00:02:24.497 --> 00:02:26.170
Take a look at our planet.

00:02:26.194 --> 00:02:27.802
This is our planet from space.

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:33.335
Unlike stars, which are hot and glow
invisible light so we can see them,

00:02:33.359 --> 00:02:36.885
our planet is, astronomically
speaking, pretty cold.

00:02:37.703 --> 00:02:39.238
So it doesn't really glow.

00:02:39.798 --> 00:02:43.457
When you see the planet looking
like a blue-green marble

00:02:43.481 --> 00:02:45.035
the way it does in this picture,

00:02:45.059 --> 00:02:48.319
you're seeing it because the sunlight
is reflecting off of it,

00:02:48.343 --> 00:02:51.926
and that's why you can see
the oceans, the clouds, the land.

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:53.853
So if the sun wasn't shining on it,

00:02:53.877 --> 00:02:56.137
we wouldn't be able
to see the earth, right?

00:02:57.016 --> 00:02:58.455
Or would we?

00:02:59.293 --> 00:03:01.268
This is our earth at night,

00:03:01.292 --> 00:03:03.403
and it is one of the most
striking examples

00:03:03.427 --> 00:03:06.689
of how we have affected
our planet on a global scale.

00:03:06.713 --> 00:03:11.280
You can see light spidering out
across the globe everywhere.

00:03:11.304 --> 00:03:14.708
Now, of course, there are broad expanses
of ocean that are still dark,

00:03:14.732 --> 00:03:18.646
and in many underdeveloped areas
there's still darkness.

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:21.773
But you'll notice
that this is a pretty global effect.

00:03:24.163 --> 00:03:27.199
We tend to think, when we think
of places being lit up,

00:03:27.223 --> 00:03:31.051
of very extreme examples --
Times Square, the Vegas Strip.

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:33.745
But really what that picture shows you

00:03:33.769 --> 00:03:36.299
is that it's not just
these extreme examples,

00:03:36.323 --> 00:03:39.049
it's anywhere that uses outdoor lighting.

00:03:39.073 --> 00:03:42.025
This tends to be a really
dramatic effect on the ground.

00:03:42.663 --> 00:03:43.890
To understand why,

00:03:43.914 --> 00:03:47.136
all you really have to do
is think about the shape of a lightbulb.

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:49.463
The lightbulb, for all practical purposes,

00:03:49.487 --> 00:03:50.854
is more or less round.

00:03:51.589 --> 00:03:55.388
This is great for its original intended
purpose of lighting up the indoors.

00:03:55.412 --> 00:03:57.556
You turn it on, light goes everywhere.

00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:01.343
An individual light bulb can light up
your whole room, more or less.

00:04:01.367 --> 00:04:04.461
Now, that's great
if you're lighting the indoors,

00:04:04.485 --> 00:04:07.255
but in its application
in outdoor lighting,

00:04:07.279 --> 00:04:09.259
that traditional shape of the light bulb,

00:04:09.283 --> 00:04:12.285
the sort of globe that spreads
light everywhere,

00:04:12.309 --> 00:04:14.013
is actually very inefficient.

00:04:14.037 --> 00:04:16.419
When you're outdoors,
mostly what you care about

00:04:16.443 --> 00:04:20.520
is lighting the ground beneath you
and your immediate surroundings.

00:04:20.544 --> 00:04:24.542
All of that light that gets scattered
outwards and upwards

00:04:24.566 --> 00:04:26.996
doesn't actually help you
light the area around you.

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:29.633
What it does is scatters up into the sky

00:04:29.657 --> 00:04:31.708
and becomes what we call
"light pollution."

00:04:31.732 --> 00:04:36.389
Even if you don't care anything
about stargazing, this should worry you,

00:04:36.413 --> 00:04:41.272
because it means that 60-70% of the energy
we use to light the outdoors

00:04:41.296 --> 00:04:43.921
is wasted by blotting out the stars.

00:04:45.625 --> 00:04:48.449
Now, like I said,
I'm a big fan of technology.

00:04:48.473 --> 00:04:51.591
Obviously, I use technology
every day; I'm a scientist.

00:04:52.208 --> 00:04:55.417
And there's this tendency
to say that it's progress that --

00:04:55.441 --> 00:05:00.541
you know, I'm not suggesting
we're going to all go live by candlelight.

00:05:00.565 --> 00:05:04.374
Indeed, technology is allowing us
to access the sky

00:05:04.398 --> 00:05:06.850
in ways that are impossible otherwise.

00:05:06.874 --> 00:05:11.179
One of the greatest examples of this is,
of course, the Hubble Space Telescope.

00:05:11.203 --> 00:05:15.160
The Hubble went up into space,
it returns pictures daily,

00:05:15.184 --> 00:05:16.735
and it allows us to see things

00:05:16.759 --> 00:05:19.976
that we are incapable of seeing
with our naked eye,

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.985
in ways that we've never been able
to do before in all of human history.

00:05:24.971 --> 00:05:28.028
Other examples of this
would be planetarium shows.

00:05:28.052 --> 00:05:32.224
In the past couple of years, planetarium
shows have become more high-tech

00:05:32.248 --> 00:05:34.184
with these great visualizations,

00:05:34.208 --> 00:05:36.732
and even though this isn't access
directly to the sky,

00:05:36.756 --> 00:05:39.671
it's at least access
to our knowledge about the sky.

00:05:39.695 --> 00:05:42.447
And indeed, we can experience
the sky in a planetarium

00:05:42.471 --> 00:05:45.160
in a way that is impossible for us to do

00:05:45.184 --> 00:05:47.368
just sitting out and looking in the dark.

00:05:48.441 --> 00:05:52.261
All of you have heard of the Hubble
Space Telescope and of planetariums.

00:05:52.285 --> 00:05:56.254
But there are also ways
for technology to enable participation

00:05:56.278 --> 00:05:58.153
in people's experience of the sky

00:05:58.177 --> 00:05:59.871
that you may not be familiar with.

00:05:59.895 --> 00:06:02.532
These are called
"citizen science projects."

00:06:02.556 --> 00:06:07.096
Citizen science is when large
research projects put their data online,

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:11.716
teach ordinary people, like you,
to go and interact with that data

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:13.747
and actually contribute to the research

00:06:13.771 --> 00:06:17.431
by making interesting or necessary
characterizations about it.

00:06:17.942 --> 00:06:21.706
One such example of this is what
I'm showing here, called "Galaxy Zoo."

00:06:22.237 --> 00:06:24.397
Galaxy Zoo is a project

00:06:24.421 --> 00:06:29.724
where people get a 20-minute --
even less than that, actually -- tutorial

00:06:29.748 --> 00:06:32.126
on how to interact
with these images of galaxies.

00:06:32.864 --> 00:06:34.922
They learn to annotate the images,

00:06:34.946 --> 00:06:37.558
and within a couple of minutes,
they're up and running,

00:06:37.582 --> 00:06:39.864
and they're making really
useful categorizations

00:06:39.888 --> 00:06:41.888
and classifications of these galaxies.

00:06:41.912 --> 00:06:43.421
Now, it's easy to understand

00:06:43.445 --> 00:06:47.634
why Galaxy Zoo would be an easy sell
for people to be involved with:

00:06:47.658 --> 00:06:49.048
it involves pretty pictures;

00:06:49.072 --> 00:06:52.049
galaxies are, generally
speaking, pretty attractive.

00:06:52.073 --> 00:06:55.388
However, there are many other flavors
of citizen science projects

00:06:55.412 --> 00:06:57.064
that people have delved into

00:06:57.088 --> 00:07:00.456
that have varying levels of abstraction,

00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:03.226
that you wouldn't necessarily think
people would jump at.

00:07:03.250 --> 00:07:07.159
One such example of this
is the citizen science project

00:07:07.183 --> 00:07:10.379
associated with the mission
that I'm part of,

00:07:10.403 --> 00:07:11.779
called the Kepler Mission.

00:07:11.803 --> 00:07:16.463
Kepler is a space telescope and it looks
for planets around other stars

00:07:16.487 --> 00:07:19.581
by measuring the light
from those stars very precisely.

00:07:19.605 --> 00:07:21.844
And we're looking for the dimmings

00:07:21.868 --> 00:07:24.778
caused by stars blocking off
some of that light.

00:07:25.785 --> 00:07:29.409
We have an associated citizen science
project called "Planet Hunters."

00:07:30.023 --> 00:07:34.574
Planet Hunters gives you,
like Galaxy Zoo, a short tutorial,

00:07:34.598 --> 00:07:37.163
and within a couple of minutes,
you're up and running;

00:07:37.187 --> 00:07:39.492
you're looking at data
from the Kepler Mission

00:07:39.516 --> 00:07:41.570
and looking for planets.

00:07:42.030 --> 00:07:44.841
The idea behind this
is an easy sell, right?

00:07:44.865 --> 00:07:49.734
But the actual process of planet-hunting
involves a lot of looking at graphs,

00:07:49.758 --> 00:07:52.649
like the one I'm showing you here,
and annotating them.

00:07:52.673 --> 00:07:56.086
I do this all day and that doesn't even
sound that interesting to me.

00:07:56.915 --> 00:08:00.826
However, not only are people
interested in doing this,

00:08:00.850 --> 00:08:04.093
but the citizen scientists
that work with Planet Hunters

00:08:04.117 --> 00:08:07.009
have actually found planets in the data

00:08:07.033 --> 00:08:09.366
that would have gone
undiscovered otherwise.

00:08:09.390 --> 00:08:12.378
This is an author list
from the paper that they published

00:08:12.402 --> 00:08:13.974
of the planet they discovered.

00:08:13.998 --> 00:08:17.072
You'll see that all the people
who contributed are listed below,

00:08:17.096 --> 00:08:20.261
and it's sort of an odd amalgam
of people's real names

00:08:20.285 --> 00:08:22.029
and their log-in names.

00:08:22.053 --> 00:08:25.799
You'll notice if you look carefully,
this is the first academic acknowledgment

00:08:25.823 --> 00:08:29.052
of the importance of Irish coffee
in the discovery process.

00:08:29.076 --> 00:08:30.788
(Laughter)

00:08:30.812 --> 00:08:35.110
I don't want to give you the idea
that these are some out-of-work scientists

00:08:35.134 --> 00:08:37.870
or just a bunch of nerds
that are really into this.

00:08:37.894 --> 00:08:41.118
There are 60,000 people
who participate in these projects,

00:08:41.142 --> 00:08:43.731
and most of them don't have
technical backgrounds.

00:08:43.755 --> 00:08:47.484
So clearly, what this is feeding into
is people's curiosity

00:08:47.508 --> 00:08:51.284
and their willingness to be part
of the scientific discovery process.

00:08:51.308 --> 00:08:53.101
People want to do this.

00:08:53.929 --> 00:08:56.362
But all of this technology

00:08:56.386 --> 00:09:00.194
and all these digitally mediated ways
of experiencing the sky

00:09:00.218 --> 00:09:04.475
still have something of a feel to me
like looking at an animal in a zoo.

00:09:05.151 --> 00:09:07.772
It's a valid way
of experiencing that thing --

00:09:07.796 --> 00:09:10.577
indeed, the lion in the cage
is still real,

00:09:10.601 --> 00:09:12.737
the Hubble images are indeed real,

00:09:12.761 --> 00:09:17.217
and you can get closer to a lion in a zoo
than you can in the wild.

00:09:17.727 --> 00:09:19.835
However, it's missing something.

00:09:20.447 --> 00:09:22.589
It's missing that savage beauty

00:09:22.613 --> 00:09:26.150
of experiencing that very thing
in the wild for yourself,

00:09:26.174 --> 00:09:27.823
unmediated by a screen.

00:09:29.042 --> 00:09:30.866
The experience of looking up

00:09:31.301 --> 00:09:36.720
and knowing that the sky you're looking at
surrounds every known living thing

00:09:36.744 --> 00:09:38.034
in the universe

00:09:38.058 --> 00:09:39.349
is very profound.

00:09:39.798 --> 00:09:41.270
Think about that for a moment.

00:09:41.294 --> 00:09:45.348
We are the only planet we know of
that has life on it.

00:09:46.392 --> 00:09:49.630
The sky that you see is shared
by every other living thing

00:09:49.654 --> 00:09:51.227
that we know of in existence.

00:09:52.654 --> 00:09:55.631
One of the things
that I really like about my work

00:09:55.655 --> 00:09:59.060
is that it allows me to step back
from my every day

00:09:59.084 --> 00:10:02.292
and to experience the larger context,

00:10:02.824 --> 00:10:08.543
this feeling that just as we go out
and try to find planets in the universe

00:10:08.567 --> 00:10:10.400
that might be like ours,

00:10:10.424 --> 00:10:15.010
it always reminds me
of how precious what we have here is.

00:10:15.752 --> 00:10:18.772
Our night sky is like a natural resource,

00:10:18.796 --> 00:10:21.579
it's as though it's a park
that you can visit

00:10:21.603 --> 00:10:23.490
without ever having to travel there.

00:10:24.150 --> 00:10:26.131
But like any natural resource,

00:10:26.155 --> 00:10:29.438
if we don't protect it,
if we don't preserve it and treasure it,

00:10:29.462 --> 00:10:31.599
it will slip away from us and be gone.

00:10:32.407 --> 00:10:34.704
So if you're interested in this,

00:10:34.728 --> 00:10:37.414
and this is something
you want to learn more about,

00:10:37.438 --> 00:10:40.790
I encourage you in particular
to visit darksky.org

00:10:40.814 --> 00:10:43.171
and to learn more
about the choices you can make

00:10:43.195 --> 00:10:45.461
that can protect the dark night sky,

00:10:45.485 --> 00:10:48.718
because it belongs to everyone,
it belongs to all of us,

00:10:48.742 --> 00:10:51.657
and therefore, it's ours
to experience as we wish.

00:10:51.681 --> 00:10:53.321
And it's also ours to lose.

00:10:53.345 --> 00:10:54.596
Thank you.

00:10:54.620 --> 00:10:56.586
(Applause)
