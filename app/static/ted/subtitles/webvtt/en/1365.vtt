00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Gabriel García Márquez is one of my favorite writers,

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
for his storytelling,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
but even more, I think,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
for the beauty and precision of his prose.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
And whether it's the opening line from "One Hundred Years of Solitude"

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
or the fantastical stream of consciousness

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
in "Autumn of the Patriarch,"

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
where the words rush by,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
page after page of unpunctuated imagery

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
sweeping the reader along

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
like some wild river

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
twisting through a primal South American jungle,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
reading Márquez is a visceral experience.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Which struck me as particularly remarkable

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
during one session with the novel

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
when I realized that I was being swept along

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
on this remarkable, vivid journey

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
in translation.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Now I was a comparative literature major in college,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
which is like an English major,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
only instead of being stuck studying Chaucer for three months,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
we got to read great literature in translation

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
from around the world.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
And as great as these books were,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
you could always tell

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
that you were getting close to the full effect.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
But not so with Márquez

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
who once praised his translator's versions

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
as being better than his own,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
which is an astonishing compliment.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
So when I heard that the translator, Gregory Rabassa,

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
had written his own book on the subject,

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
I couldn't wait to read it.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
It's called apropos of the Italian adage

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
that I lifted from his forward,

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
"If This Be Treason."

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
And it's a charming read.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
It's highly recommended for anyone who's interested

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
in the translator's art.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
But the reason that I mention it

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
is that early on, Rabassa offers

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000
this elegantly simple insight:

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
"Every act of communication

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
is an act of translation."

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
Now maybe that's been obvious to all of you for a long time,

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
but for me,

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
as often as I'd encountered

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
that exact difficulty on a daily basis,

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
I had never seen the inherent challenge of communication

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
in so crystalline a light.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
Ever since I can remember

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
thinking consciously about such things,

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
communication has been my central passion.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
Even as a child,

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
I remember thinking that what I really wanted most in life

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
was to be able to understand everything

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000
and then to communicate it to everyone else.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000
So no ego problems.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
It's funny, my wife, Daisy,

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
whose family is littered with schizophrenics --

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
and I mean littered with them --

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.000
once said to me, "Chris, I already have a brother who thinks he's God.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
I don't need a husband who wants to be."

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
(Laughter)

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
Anyway, as I plunged through my 20s

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
ever more aware of how unobtainable

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
the first part of my childhood ambition was,

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
it was that second part,

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
being able to successfully communicate to others

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
whatever knowledge I was gaining,

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
where the futility of my quest really set in.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
Time after time,

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
whenever I set out to share some great truth

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
with a soon-to-be grateful recipient,

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
it had the opposite effect.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
Interestingly, when your opening line of communication is,

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
"Hey, listen up,

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.000
because I'm about to drop some serious knowledge on you,"

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
it's amazing how quickly you'll discover

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000
both ice and the firing squad.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000
Finally, after about 10 years

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000
of alienating friends and strangers alike,

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000
I finally got it,

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000
a new personal truth all my own,

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.000
that if I was going to ever communicate well with other people

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
the ideas that I was gaining,

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000
I'd better find a different way of going about it.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.000
And that's when I discovered comedy.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.000
Now comedy travels along a distinct wavelength

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
from other forms of language.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000
If I had to place it on an arbitrary spectrum,

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000
I'd say it falls somewhere

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000
between poetry and lies.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000
And I'm not talking about all comedy here,

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000
because, clearly, there's plenty of humor

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.000
that colors safely within the lines of what we already think and feel.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000
What I want to talk about

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.000
is the unique ability that the best comedy and satire has

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000
at circumventing our ingrained perspectives --

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
comedy as the philosopher's stone.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
It takes the base metal of our conventional wisdom

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
and transforms it through ridicule

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000
into a different way of seeing

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000
and ultimately being in the world.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000
Because that's what I take

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.000
from the theme of this conference: Gained in Translation.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000
That it's about communication

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000
that doesn't just produce greater understanding

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000
within the individual,

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000
but leads to real change.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000
Which in my experience means communication

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000
that manages to speak to and expand

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000
our concept of self-interest.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000
Now I'm big on speaking to people's self-interest

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000
because we're all wired for that.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000
It's part of our survival package,

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000
and that's why it's become so important for us,

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.000
and that's why we're always listening at that level.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.000
And also because that's where,

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000
in terms of our own self-interest,

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000
we finally begin to grasp

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.000
our ability to respond, our responsibility

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000
to the rest of the world.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000
Now as to what I mean by the best comedy and satire,

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000
I mean work that comes first and foremost

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.000
from a place of honesty and integrity.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000
Now if you think back

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.000
on Tina Fey's impersonations on Saturday Night Live

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000
of the newly nominated vice presidential candidate

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000
Sarah Palin,

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000
they were devastating.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.000
Fey demonstrated far more effectively than any political pundit

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.000
the candidate's fundamental lack of seriousness,

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000
cementing an impression

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.000
that the majority of the American public still holds today.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000
And the key detail of this

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000
is that Fey's scripts weren't written by her

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000
and they weren't written by the SNL writers.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000
They were lifted verbatim

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000
from Palin's own remarks.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:35.000
(Laughter)

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000
Here was a Palin impersonator

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000
quoting Palin word for word.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000
Now that's honesty and integrity,

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000
and it's also why Fey's performances

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000
left such a lasting impression.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.000
On the other side of the political spectrum,

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000
the first time that I heard Rush Limbaugh

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:54.000
refer to presidential hopeful John Edwards as the Breck girl

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.000
I knew that he'd made a direct hit.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.000
Now it's not often that I'm going to associate

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.000
the words honesty and integrity with Limbaugh,

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.000
but it's really hard to argue with that punchline.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000
The description perfectly captured

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.000
Edwards' personal vanity.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.000
And guess what?

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.000
That ended up being the exact personality trait

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.000
that was at the core of the scandal that ended his political career.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000
Now The Daily Show with John Stewart

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000
is by far the most --

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:27.000
(Applause)

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000
(Laughter)

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:34.000
it's by far the most well-documented example

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.000
of the effectiveness of this kind of comedy.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000
Survey after survey,

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.000
from Pew Research to the Annenberg Center for Public Policy,

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.000
has found that Daily Show viewers are better informed about current events

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:49.000
than the viewers of all major network and cable news shows.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:52.000
(Applause)

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000
Now whether this says more

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.000
about the conflict between integrity and profitability

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.000
of corporate journalism

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000
than it does about the attentiveness of Stewart's viewers,

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.000
the larger point remains

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.000
that Stewart's material

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:08.000
is always grounded in a commitment to the facts --

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.000
not because his intent is to inform. It's not.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.000
His intent is to be funny.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.000
It just so happens that Stewart's brand of funny

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.000
doesn't work unless the facts are true.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.000
And the result is great comedy

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:23.000
that's also an information delivery system

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:26.000
that scores markedly higher in both credibility and retention

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.000
than the professional news media.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000
Now this is doubly ironic

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:34.000
when you consider that what gives comedy its edge

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000
at reaching around people's walls

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.000
is the way that it uses deliberate misdirection.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.000
A great piece of comedy is a verbal magic trick,

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.000
where you think it's going over here

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:47.000
and then all of a sudden you're transported over here.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.000
And there's this mental delight

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.000
that's followed by the physical response of laughter,

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.000
which, not coincidentally,

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.000
releases endorphins in the brain.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.000
And just like that, you've been seduced

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.000
into a different way of looking at something

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:02.000
because the endorphins have brought down your defenses.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000
This is the exact opposite

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.000
of the way that anger and fear and panic,

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:09.000
all of the flight-or-fight responses, operate.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:12.000
Flight-or-fight releases adrenalin,

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.000
which throws our walls up sky-high.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.000
And the comedy comes along,

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.000
dealing with a lot of the same areas

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.000
where our defenses are the strongest --

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:23.000
race, religion, politics, sexuality --

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:26.000
only by approaching them through humor instead of adrenalin,

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000
we get endorphins

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.000
and the alchemy of laughter turns our walls into windows,

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:34.000
revealing a fresh and unexpected point of view.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:37.000
Now let me give you an example from my act.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.000
I have some material

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.000
about the so-called radical gay agenda,

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.000
which starts off by asking,

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.000
how radical is the gay agenda?

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:48.000
Because from what I can tell, the three things gay Americans seem to want most

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.000
are to join the military, get married and start a family.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:55.000
(Laughter)

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:59.000
Three things I've tried to avoid my entire life.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.000
(Laughter)

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:04.000
Have at it you radical bastards. The field is yours.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:07.000
(Laughter)

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.000
And that's followed by these lines

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.000
about gay adoption:

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.000
What is the problem with gay adoption?

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.000
Why is this remotely controversial?

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:18.000
If you have a baby and you think that baby's gay,

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.000
you should be allowed to put it up for adoption.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.000
(Laughter)

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.000
You have given birth to an abomination.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:27.000
Remove it from your household.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:31.000
Now by taking the biblical epithet "abomination"

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:35.000
and attaching it to the ultimate image of innocence, a baby,

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.000
this joke short circuits the emotional wiring

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.000
behind the debate

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:42.000
and it leaves the audience with the opportunity, through their laughter,

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:44.000
to question its validity.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.000
Misdirection isn't the only trick

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.000
that comedy has up its sleeve.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.000
Economy of language

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.000
is another real strong suit of great comedy.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.000
There are few phrases

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:57.000
that pack a more concentrated dose of subject and symbol

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.000
than the perfect punchline.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.000
Bill Hicks -- and if you don't know his work,

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.000
you should really Google him --

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.000
Hicks had a routine

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:08.000
about getting into one of those childhood bragging contests on the playground,

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.000
where finally the other kid says to him,

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:13.000
"Huh? Well my dad can beat up your dad,"

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.000
to which Hicks replies,

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:17.000
"Really? How soon?"

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:22.000
(Laughter)

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.000
That's an entire childhood

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.000
in three words.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:29.000
(Laughter)

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.000
Not to mention what it reveals

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:33.000
about the adult who's speaking them.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.000
And one last powerful attribute

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.000
that comedy has as communication

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.000
is that it's inherently viral.

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.000
People can't wait

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.000
to pass along that new great joke.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:46.000
And this isn't some new phenomenon of our wired world.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.000
Comedy has been crossing country

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.000
with remarkable speed

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.000
way before the Internet, social media,

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:54.000
even cable TV.

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.000
Back in 1980

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:59.000
when comedian Richard Pryor accidentally set himself on fire

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.000
during a freebasing accident,

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:03.000
I was in Los Angeles the day after it happened

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:07.000
and then I was in Washington D.C. two days after that.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:10.000
And I heard the exact same punchline on both coasts --

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:14.000
something about the Ignited Negro College Fund.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:18.000
Clearly, it didn't come out of a Tonight Show monologue.

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.000
And my guess here -- and I have no research on this --

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:23.000
is that if you really were to look back at it and if you could research it,

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.000
you'd find out that comedy

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.000
is the second oldest viral profession.

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.000
First there were drums

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.000
and then knock-knock jokes.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:33.000
(Laughter)

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:36.000
But it's when you put all of these elements together --

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:39.000
when you get the viral appeal of a great joke

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.000
with a powerful punchline

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:43.000
that's crafted from honesty and integrity,

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:46.000
it can have a real world impact

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.000
at changing a conversation.

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.000
Now I have a close friend, Joel Pett,

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.000
who's the editorial cartoonist

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.000
for the Lexington Herald-Leader.

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:57.000
And he used to be the USA Today Monday morning guy.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.000
I was visiting with Joel

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:02.000
the weekend before the Copenhagen conference on climate change opened

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.000
in December of 2009.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.000
And Joel was explaining to me

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.000
that, because USA Today

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.000
was one of America's four papers of record,

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:14.000
it would be scanned by virtually everyone in attendance at the conference,

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:17.000
which meant that, if he hit it out of the park with his cartoon

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:19.000
on Monday, the opening day of the conference,

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:21.000
it could get passed around

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:24.000
at the highest level among actual decision-makers.

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:27.000
So we started talking about climate change.

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:29.000
And it turned out that Joel and I

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:31.000
were both bothered by the same thing,

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:33.000
which was how so much of the debate

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:35.000
was still focused on the science

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:37.000
and how complete it was or wasn't,

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.000
which, to both of us,

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:42.000
seems somewhat intentionally off point.

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:45.000
Because first of all, there's this false premise

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:49.000
that such a thing as complete science exists.

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:52.000
Now Governor Perry of my newly-adopted state of Texas

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:55.000
was pushing this same line this past summer

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:59.000
at the beginning of his oops-fated campaign

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:02.000
for the Republican presidential nomination,

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:05.000
proclaiming over and over that the science wasn't complete

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:08.000
at the same time that 250

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:11.000
out of 254 counties in the state of Texas

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:14.000
were on fire.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.000
And Perry's policy solution

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.000
was to ask the people of Texas

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:21.000
to pray for rain.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.000
Personally, I was praying for four more fires

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:26.000
so we could finally complete the damn science.

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:31.000
(Laughter)

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.000
But back in 2009,

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:36.000
the question Joel and I kept turning over and over

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.000
was why this late in the game

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:41.000
so much energy was being spent talking about the science

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:44.000
when the policies necessary to address climate change

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:48.000
were unequivocally beneficial for humanity in the long run

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.000
regardless of the science.

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:53.000
So we tossed it back and forth until Joel came up with this.

00:13:53.000 --> 00:14:01.000
Cartoon: "What if it's a big hoax and we create a better world for nothing?"

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:04.000
(Laughter)

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:06.000
You've got to love that idea.

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:13.000
(Applause)

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:17.000
How about that? How about we create a better world for nothing?

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:20.000
Not for God, not for country, not for profit --

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:24.000
just as a basic metric for global decision-making.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:27.000
And this cartoon hit the bull's eye.

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:29.000
Shortly after the conference was over,

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:31.000
Joel got a request for a signed copy

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:33.000
from the head of the EPA in Washington

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:35.000
whose wall it now hangs on.

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:38.000
And not long after that, he got another request for a copy

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:40.000
from the head of the EPA in California

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:43.000
who used it as part of her presentation

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:46.000
at an international conference on climate change

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.000
in Sacramento last year.

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:50.000
And it didn't stop there.

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:53.000
To date, Joel's gotten requests from over 40 environmental groups,

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:56.000
in the United States, Canada and Europe.

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:58.000
And earlier this year,

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:00.000
he got a request from the Green Party in Australia

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.000
who used it in their campaign

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:04.000
where it became part of the debate

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:07.000
that resulted in the Australian parliament

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:09.000
adopting the most rigorous carbon tax regime

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:12.000
of any country in the world.

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:17.000
(Applause)

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:19.000
That is a lot of punch

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:22.000
for 14 words.

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:24.000
So my suggestion to those of you out here

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:27.000
who are seriously focused on creating a better world

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:29.000
is to take a little bit of time each day

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:32.000
and practice thinking funny,

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:35.000
because you might just find the question that you've been looking for.

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:37.000
Thank you.

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:39.000
(Applause)
