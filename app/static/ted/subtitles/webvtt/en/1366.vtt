00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
My story begins right here actually in Rajasthan

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
about two years ago.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
I was in the desert, under the starry skies

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
with the Sufi singer Mukhtiar Ali.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
And we were in conversation

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
about how nothing had changed

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
since the time of the ancient Indian epic "The Mahabharata."

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
So back in the day, when us Indians wanted to travel

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
we'd jump into a chariot and we'd zoom across the sky.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Now we do the same with airplanes.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Back then,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
when Arjuna, the great Indian warrior prince,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
when he was thirsty, he'd take out a bow,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
he'd shoot it into the ground and water would come out.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
Now we do the same

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
with drills and machines.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
The conclusion that we came to

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
was that magic had been replaced

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
by machinery.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
And this made me really sad.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
I found myself becoming a little bit of a technophobe.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
I was terrified by this idea

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
that I would lose the ability

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
to enjoy and appreciate the sunset

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
without having my camera on me, without tweeting it to my friends.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
And it felt like technology

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
should enable magic, not kill it.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
When I was a little girl,

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
my grandfather gave me his little silver pocket watch.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
And this piece of 50-year-old technology

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
became the most magical thing to me.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
It became a gilded gateway

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
into a world full of pirates and shipwrecks

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
and images in my imagination.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
So I felt like our cellphones

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
and our fancy watches and our cameras

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
had stopped us from dreaming.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
They stopped us from being inspired.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
And so I jumped in, I jumped into this world of technology,

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
to see how I could use it to enable magic

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
as opposed to kill it.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
I've been illustrating books since I was 16.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
And so when I saw the iPad,

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
I saw it as a storytelling device

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
that could connect readers all over the world.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
It can know how we're holding it.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
It can know where we are.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
It brings together image and text

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
and animation and sound and touch.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
Storytelling is becoming

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
more and more multi-sensorial.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
But what are we doing with it?

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
So I'm actually just going to go in and launch Khoya,

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000
an interactive app for the iPad.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
So it says, "Place your fingers

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
upon each light."

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
And so --

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:26.000
(Music)

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.000
It says, "This box belongs to ... "

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
And so I type in my name.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
And actually I become a character in the book.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
At various points, a little letter drops down to me --

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
and the iPad knows where you live because of GPS --

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
which is actually addressed to me.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
The child in me is really excited

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
by these kinds of possibilities.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
Now I've been talking a lot about magic.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000
And I don't mean wizards and dragons,

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
I mean the kind of childhood magic,

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000
those ideas that we all harbored as children.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000
This idea of fireflies in a jar, for some reason,

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
was always really exciting to me.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000
And so over here you need to tilt your iPad,

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000
take the fireflies out.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.000
And they actually illuminate your way through the rest of the book.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.000
Another idea that really fascinated me as a child

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
was that an entire galaxy could be contained

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000
within a single marble.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000
And so over here,

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000
each book and each world

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000
becomes a little marble

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000
that I drag in

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.000
to this magical device within the device.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:49.000
And it opens up a map.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.000
All along, all fantasy books have always had maps,

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000
but these maps have been static.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
This is a map that grows and glows

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
and becomes your navigation for the rest of the book.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.000
It reveals itself to you at certain points in the book as well.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000
So I'm just going to enter in.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000
Another thing that's actually really important to me

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000
is creating content that is Indian

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000
and yet very contemporary.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000
Over here, these are the Apsaras.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.000
So we've all heard about fairies and we've all heard about nymphs,

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.000
but how many people outside of India

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.000
know about their Indian counterparts, the Apsaras?

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:29.000
These poor Apsaras have been trapped inside Indra's chambers for thousands of years

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000
in an old and musty book.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000
And so we're bringing them back

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000
in a contemporary story for children.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.000
And a story that actually deals with new issues

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000
like the environmental crisis.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.000
(Music)

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:14.000
Speaking of the environmental crisis,

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.000
I think a big problem has been in the last 10 years

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000
is that children have been locked inside their rooms,

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000
glued to their PCs, they haven't been able to get out.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000
But now with mobile technology,

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.000
we can actually take our children outside into the natural world

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000
with their technology.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000
One of the interactions in the book

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000
is that you're sent off on this quest

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.000
where you need to go outside,

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000
take out your camera on the iPad

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.000
and collect pictures of different natural objects.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000
When I was a child, I had multiple collections

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.000
of sticks and stones and pebbles and shells.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000
And somehow kids don't do that anymore.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000
So in bringing back this childhood ritual,

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.000
you need to go out

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000
and, in one chapter, take a picture of a flower

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000
and then tag it.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.000
In another chapter, you need to take a picture of a piece of bark

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000
and then tag that.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.000
And what happens

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000
is that you actually create a digital collection of photographs

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.000
that you can then put up online.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000
A child in London puts up a picture of a fox

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000
and says, "Oh, I saw a fox today."

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.000
A child in India says, "I saw a monkey today."

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.000
And it creates this kind of social network

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.000
around a collection of digital photographs

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000
that you've actually taken.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.000
In the possibilities of linking together

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.000
magic, the earth and technology,

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.000
there are multiple possibilities.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.000
In the next book, we plan on having an interaction

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000
where you take your iPad out with the video on

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000
and through augmented reality,

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000
you see this layer of animated pixies

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:35.000
appear on a houseplant that's outside your house.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.000
At one point, your screen is filled up with leaves.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.000
And so you need to make the sound of wind and blow them away

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.000
and read the rest of the book.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:46.000
We're moving, we're all moving here,

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.000
to a world where the forces of nature

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.000
come closer together to technology,

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.000
and magic and technology can come closer together.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.000
We're harnessing energy from the sun.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.000
We're bringing our children and ourselves

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000
closer to the natural world

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.000
and that magic and joy

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.000
and childhood love that we had

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.000
through the simple medium of a story.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000
Thank you.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:15.000
(Applause)
