WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
I'm going to talk today about saving more,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
but not today, tomorrow.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
I'm going to talk about Save More Tomorrow.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
It's a program that Richard Thaler

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
from the University of Chicago and I

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
devised maybe 15 years ago.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
The program, in a sense,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
is an example of behavioral finance

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
on steroids --

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
how we could really use behavioral finance.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Now you might ask, what is behavioral finance?

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
So let's think about how we manage our money.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Let's start with mortgages.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
It's kind of a recent topic,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
at least in the U.S.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
A lot of people buy

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
the biggest house they can afford,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
and actually slightly bigger than that.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
And then they foreclose.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
And then they blame the banks

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
for being the bad guys who gave them the mortgages.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
Let's also think about

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
how we manage risks --

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
for example, investing in the stock market.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
Two years ago, three years ago, about four years ago,

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
markets did well.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
We were risk takers, of course.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
Then market stocks seize

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
and we're like, "Wow.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
These losses, they feel, emotionally,

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
they feel very different

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
from what we actually thought about it

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
when markets were going up."

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
So we're probably not doing a great job

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
when it comes to risk taking.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
How many of you have iPhones?

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
Anyone? Wonderful.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
I would bet many more of you

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
insure your iPhone --

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
you're implicitly buying insurance by having an extended warranty.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
What if you lose your iPhone?

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
What if you do this?

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
How many of you have kids?

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
Anyone?

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
Keep your hands up

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
if you have sufficient life insurance.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
I see a lot of hands coming down.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
I would predict,

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
if you're a representative sample,

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
that many more of you

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
insure your iPhones than your lives,

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
even when you have kids.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000
We're not doing that well when it comes to insurance.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.000
The average American household

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
spends 1,000 dollars a year

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
on lotteries.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000
And I know it sounds crazy.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
How many of you spend a thousand dollars a year on lotteries?

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
No one.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000
So that tells us that the people not in this room

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
are spending more than a thousand

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
to get the average to a thousand.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
Low-income people

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.000
spend a lot more than a thousand on lotteries.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
So where does it take us?

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000
We're not doing a great job managing money.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000
Behavioral finance is really a combination

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000
of psychology and economics,

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
trying to understand

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
the money mistakes people make.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
And I can keep standing here

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.000
for the 12 minutes and 53 seconds that I have left

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
and make fun of all sorts of ways

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
we manage money,

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
and at the end you're going to ask, "How can we help people?"

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000
And that's what I really want to focus on today.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
How do we take an understanding

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000
of the money mistakes people make,

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000
and then turning the behavioral challenges

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000
into behavioral solutions?

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
And what I'm going to talk about today

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
is Save More Tomorrow.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
I want to address the issue

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
of savings.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
We have on the screen

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000
a representative sample

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000
of 100 Americans.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000
And we're going to look at their saving behavior.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000
First thing to notice is,

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000
half of them

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000
do not even have access

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000
to a 401(k) plan.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.000
They cannot make savings easy.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.000
They cannot have money go away from their paycheck

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000
into a 401(k) plan

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000
before they see it,

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
before they can touch it.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.000
What about the remaining half of the people?

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.000
Some of them elect not to save.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000
They're just too lazy.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.000
They never get around to logging into a complicated website

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.000
and doing 17 clicks to join the 401(k) plan.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000
And then they have to decide how they're going to invest

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000
in their 52 choices,

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:21.000
and they never heard about what is a money market fund.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000
And they get overwhelmed and the just don't join.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:28.000
How many people end up saving to a 401(k) plan?

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000
One third of Americans.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000
Two thirds are not saving now.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000
Are they saving enough?

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000
Take out those

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000
who say they save too little.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000
One out of 10

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.000
are saving enough.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000
Nine out of 10

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.000
either cannot save through their 401(k) plan,

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.000
decide not to save -- or don't decide --

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.000
or save too little.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000
We think we have a problem

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000
of people saving too much.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000
Let's look at that.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000
We have one person --

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000
well, actually we're going to slice him in half

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000
because it's less than one percent.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.000
Roughly half a percent of Americans

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:17.000
feel that they save too much.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000
What are we going to do about it?

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000
That's what I really want to focus on.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000
We have to understand

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000
why people are not saving,

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000
and then we can hopefully flip

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000
the behavioral challenges

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000
into behavioral solutions,

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.000
and then see how powerful it might be.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000
So let me divert for a second

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.000
as we're going to identify the problems,

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.000
the challenges, the behavioral challenges,

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000
that prevent people from saving.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:47.000
I'm going to divert and talk about bananas and chocolate.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.000
Suppose we had another wonderful TED event next week.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000
And during the break

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.000
there would be a snack

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000
and you could choose bananas or chocolate.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.000
How many of you think you would like to have bananas

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000
during this hypothetical TED event next week?

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.000
Who would go for bananas?

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000
Wonderful.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000
I predict scientifically

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.000
74 percent of you will go for bananas.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:14.000
Well that's at least what one wonderful study predicted.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.000
And then count down the days

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:22.000
and see what people ended up eating.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.000
The same people that imagined themselves

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000
eating the bananas

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000
ended up eating chocolates

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000
a week later.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000
Self-control

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.000
is not a problem in the future.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000
It's only a problem now

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:43.000
when the chocolate is next to us.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:46.000
What does it have to do with time and savings,

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:49.000
this issue of immediate gratification?

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:53.000
Or as some economists call it, present bias.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000
We think about saving. We know we should be saving.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.000
We know we'll do it next year, but today let us go and spend.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000
Christmas is coming,

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.000
we might as well buy a lot of gifts for everyone we know.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:07.000
So this issue of present bias

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000
causes us to think about saving,

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000
but end up spending.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.000
Let me now talk

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000
about another behavioral obstacle to saving

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.000
having to do with inertia.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.000
But again, a little diversion

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:22.000
to the topic of organ donation.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:25.000
Wonderful study comparing different countries.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:28.000
We're going to look at two similar countries,

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:31.000
Germany and Austria.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.000
And in Germany,

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.000
if you would like to donate your organs --

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.000
God forbid something really bad

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.000
happens to you --

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.000
when you get your driving license or an I.D.,

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.000
you check the box saying,

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.000
"I would like to donate my organs."

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.000
Not many people like checking boxes.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.000
It takes effort. You need to think.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:53.000
Twelve percent do.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:56.000
Austria, a neighboring country,

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.000
slightly similar, slightly different.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000
What's the difference?

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000
Well, you still have choice.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000
You will decide

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:07.000
whether you want to donate your organs or not.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.000
But when you get your driving license,

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.000
you check the box

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:15.000
if you do not want to donate your organ.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.000
Nobody checks boxes.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.000
That's kind of too much effort.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:22.000
One percent check the box. The rest do nothing.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.000
Doing nothing is very common.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.000
Not many people check boxes.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.000
What are the implications

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000
to saving lives

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:34.000
and having organs available?

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.000
In Germany, 12 percent check the box.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.000
Twelve percent are organ donors.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.000
Huge shortage of organs,

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.000
God forbid, if you need one.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:46.000
In Austria, again, nobody checks the box.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:49.000
Therefore, 99 percent of people

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000
are organ donors.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.000
Inertia, lack of action.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.000
What is the default setting

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.000
if people do nothing,

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:00.000
if they keep procrastinating, if they don't check the boxes?

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000
Very powerful.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000
We're going to talk

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:08.000
about what happens if people are overwhelmed and scared

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:11.000
to make their 401(k) choices.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:14.000
Are we going to make them automatically join the plan,

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.000
or are they going to be left out?

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:19.000
In too many 401(k) plans,

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.000
if people do nothing,

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:24.000
it means they're not saving for retirement,

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.000
if they don't check the box.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:29.000
And checking the box takes effort.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:32.000
So we've chatted about a couple of behavioral challenges.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:35.000
One more before we flip the challenges into solutions,

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.000
having to do with monkeys and apples.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.000
No, no, no, this is a real study

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:43.000
and it's got a lot to do with behavioral economics.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:46.000
One group of monkeys gets an apple, they're pretty happy.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.000
The other group gets two apples, one is taken away.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.000
They still have an apple left.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:53.000
They're really mad.

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:56.000
Why have you taken our apple?

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:59.000
This is the notion of loss aversion.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.000
We hate losing stuff,

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:04.000
even if it doesn't mean a lot of risk.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:07.000
You would hate to go to the ATM,

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.000
take out 100 dollars

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.000
and notice that you lost one of those $20 bills.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.000
It's very painful,

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.000
even though it doesn't mean anything.

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:19.000
Those 20 dollars might have been a quick lunch.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:23.000
So this notion of loss aversion

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:26.000
kicks in when it comes to savings too,

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.000
because people, mentally

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:31.000
and emotionally and intuitively

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:33.000
frame savings as a loss

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:36.000
because I have to cut my spending.

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.000
So we talked about

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.000
all sorts of behavioral challenges

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:44.000
having to do with savings eventually.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:47.000
Whether you think about immediate gratification,

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:50.000
and the chocolates versus bananas,

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:53.000
it's just painful to save now.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.000
It's a lot more fun

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.000
to spend now.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:00.000
We talked about inertia and organ donations

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.000
and checking the box.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:04.000
If people have to check a lot of boxes

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:06.000
to join a 401(k) plan,

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.000
they're going to keep procrastinating

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.000
and not join.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.000
And last, we talked about loss aversion,

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.000
and the monkeys and the apples.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:17.000
If people frame mentally

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:20.000
saving for retirement as a loss,

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:23.000
they're not going to be saving for retirement.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.000
So we've got these challenges,

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.000
and what Richard Thaler and I

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.000
were always fascinated by --

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.000
take behavioral finance,

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:33.000
make it behavioral finance on steroids

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.000
or behavioral finance 2.0

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:37.000
or behavioral finance in action --

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:41.000
flip the challenges into solutions.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:44.000
And we came up with an embarrassingly simple solution

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:48.000
called Save More, not today, Tomorrow.

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.000
How is it going to solve the challenges

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.000
we chatted about?

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.000
If you think about the problem

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.000
of bananas versus chocolates,

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:59.000
we think we're going to eat bananas next week.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:02.000
We think we're going to save more next year.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:05.000
Save More Tomorrow

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:07.000
invites employees

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:09.000
to save more maybe next year --

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:11.000
sometime in the future

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.000
when we can imagine ourselves

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:15.000
eating bananas,

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:17.000
volunteering more in the community,

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:21.000
exercising more and doing all the right things on the planet.

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:24.000
Now we also talked about checking the box

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:27.000
and the difficulty of taking action.

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:29.000
Save More Tomorrow

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:31.000
makes it easy.

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:33.000
It's an autopilot.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:37.000
Once you tell me you would like to save more in the future,

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.000
let's say every January

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:42.000
you're going to be saving more automatically

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:45.000
and it's going to go away from your paycheck to the 401(k) plan

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:47.000
before you see it, before you touch it,

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:49.000
before you get the issue

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:52.000
of immediate gratification.

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:55.000
But what are we going to do about the monkeys

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.000
and loss aversion?

00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:59.000
Next January comes

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.000
and people might feel that if they save more,

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:04.000
they have to spend less, and that's painful.

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:07.000
Well, maybe it shouldn't be just January.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:10.000
Maybe we should make people save more

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:13.000
when they make more money.

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:16.000
That way, when they make more money, when they get a pay raise,

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:20.000
they don't have to cut their spending.

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.000
They take a little bit

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.000
of the increase in the paycheck home

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.000
and spend more --

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:28.000
take a little bit of the increase

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.000
and put it in a 401(k) plan.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.000
So that is the program,

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.000
embarrassingly simple,

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:36.000
but as we're going to see,

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.000
extremely powerful.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.000
We first implemented it,

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:42.000
Richard Thaler and I,

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:45.000
back in 1998.

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:48.000
Mid-sized company in the Midwest,

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.000
blue collar employees

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.000
struggling to pay their bills

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:54.000
repeatedly told us

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:57.000
they cannot save more right away.

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:00.000
Saving more today is not an option.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.000
We invited them to save

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:05.000
three percentage points more

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:08.000
every time they get a pay raise.

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:11.000
And here are the results.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:13.000
We're seeing here a three and a half-year period,

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:15.000
four pay raises,

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:17.000
people who were struggling to save,

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:19.000
were saving three percent of their paycheck,

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:21.000
three and a half years later

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:24.000
saving almost four times as much,

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:27.000
almost 14 percent.

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:29.000
And there's shoes and bicycles

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:31.000
and things on this chart

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:33.000
because I don't want to just throw numbers

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:35.000
in a vacuum.

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:38.000
I want, really, to think about the fact

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:40.000
that saving four times more

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.000
is a huge difference

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:44.000
in terms of the lifestyle

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.000
that people will be able to afford.

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.000
It's real.

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:51.000
It's not just numbers on a piece of paper.

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:53.000
Whereas with saving three percent,

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:55.000
people might have to add nice sneakers

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:57.000
so they can walk,

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:01.000
because they won't be able to afford anything else,

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.000
when they save 14 percent

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:06.000
they might be able to maybe have nice dress shoes

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:09.000
to walk to the car to drive.

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:11.000
This is a real difference.

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:16.000
By now, about 60 percent of the large companies

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:19.000
actually have programs like this in place.

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:22.000
It's been part of the Pension Protection Act.

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:24.000
And needless to say that Thaler and I

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:27.000
have been blessed to be part of this program

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:29.000
and make a difference.

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:31.000
Let me wrap

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:34.000
with two key messages.

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:37.000
One is behavioral finance

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:40.000
is extremely powerful.

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:43.000
This is just one example.

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:45.000
Message two

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:47.000
is there's still a lot to do.

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:50.000
This is really the tip of the iceberg.

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:53.000
If you think about people and mortgages

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:56.000
and buying houses and then not being able to pay for it,

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:58.000
we need to think about that.

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:01.000
If you're thinking about people taking too much risk

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:04.000
and not understanding how much risk they're taking

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:06.000
or taking too little risk,

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:08.000
we need to think about that.

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:11.000
If you think about people spending a thousand dollars a year

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:13.000
on lottery tickets,

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:15.000
we need to think about that.

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:17.000
The average actually,

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:19.000
the record is in Singapore.

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:21.000
The average household

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:24.000
spends $4,000 a year on lottery tickets.

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:26.000
We've got a lot to do,

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:28.000
a lot to solve,

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:31.000
also in the retirement area

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:33.000
when it comes to what people do with their money

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:35.000
after retirement.

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:37.000
One last question:

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:40.000
How many of you feel comfortable

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:42.000
that as you're planning for retirement

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:45.000
you have a really solid plan

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:47.000
when you're going to retire,

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:50.000
when you're going to claim Social Security benefits,

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:52.000
what lifestyle to expect,

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:54.000
how much to spend every month

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:56.000
so you're not going to run out of money?

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:59.000
How many of you feel you have a solid plan for the future

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:03.000
when it comes to post-retirement decisions.

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:07.000
One, two, three, four.

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:09.000
Less than three percent

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:11.000
of a very sophisticated audience.

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:14.000
Behavioral finance has a long way.

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:16.000
There's a lot of opportunities

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:20.000
to make it powerful again and again and again.

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:22.000
Thank you.

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:24.000
(Applause)
