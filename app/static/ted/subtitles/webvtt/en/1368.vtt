WEBVTT

00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:02.921
How can I speak in 10 minutes

00:00:02.945 --> 00:00:06.489
about the bonds of women
over three generations,

00:00:06.513 --> 00:00:09.564
about how the astonishing
strength of those bonds

00:00:09.588 --> 00:00:12.474
took hold in the life
of a four-year-old girl

00:00:13.225 --> 00:00:18.056
huddled with her young sister,
her mother and her grandmother

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:21.906
for five days and nights
in a small boat in the China Sea

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:23.247
more than 30 years ago.

00:00:24.473 --> 00:00:27.027
Bonds that took hold
in the life of that small girl

00:00:27.051 --> 00:00:28.215
and never let go --

00:00:29.507 --> 00:00:32.105
that small girl now
living in San Francisco

00:00:32.129 --> 00:00:33.689
and speaking to you today.

00:00:34.939 --> 00:00:36.721
This is not a finished story.

00:00:37.525 --> 00:00:40.194
It is a jigsaw puzzle
still being put together.

00:00:41.117 --> 00:00:43.106
Let me tell you about some of the pieces.

00:00:44.956 --> 00:00:48.812
Imagine the first piece:
a man burning his life's work.

00:00:49.674 --> 00:00:52.943
He is a poet, a playwright,

00:00:52.967 --> 00:00:54.249
a man whose whole life

00:00:54.273 --> 00:00:58.349
had been balanced on the single hope
of his country's unity and freedom.

00:00:59.253 --> 00:01:02.541
Imagine him as the communists
enter Saigon --

00:01:02.565 --> 00:01:05.975
confronting the fact
that his life had been a complete waste.

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.292
Words, for so long his friends,
now mocked him.

00:01:10.251 --> 00:01:11.976
He retreated into silence.

00:01:12.727 --> 00:01:14.878
He died broken by history.

00:01:16.442 --> 00:01:17.976
He is my grandfather.

00:01:19.087 --> 00:01:20.854
I never knew him in real life.

00:01:23.011 --> 00:01:25.544
But our lives are much more
than our memories.

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:28.976
My grandmother never
let me forget his life.

00:01:29.665 --> 00:01:32.782
My duty was not to allow
it to have been in vain,

00:01:32.806 --> 00:01:37.286
and my lesson was to learn
that, yes, history tried to crush us,

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:38.460
but we endured.

00:01:40.016 --> 00:01:43.531
The next piece of the jigsaw
is of a boat in the early dawn

00:01:43.555 --> 00:01:45.541
slipping silently out to sea.

00:01:46.831 --> 00:01:49.604
My mother, Mai, was 18
when her father died --

00:01:50.322 --> 00:01:52.504
already in an arranged marriage,

00:01:52.528 --> 00:01:54.493
already with two small girls.

00:01:55.521 --> 00:01:58.623
For her, life had distilled
itself into one task:

00:01:59.226 --> 00:02:02.355
the escape of her family
and a new life in Australia.

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:06.571
It was inconceivable to her
that she would not succeed.

00:02:07.674 --> 00:02:10.576
So after a four-year saga
that defies fiction,

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:13.825
a boat slipped out to sea
disguised as a fishing vessel.

00:02:15.413 --> 00:02:17.230
All the adults knew the risks.

00:02:18.358 --> 00:02:21.500
The greatest fear
was of pirates, rape and death.

00:02:22.996 --> 00:02:24.888
Like most adults on the boat,

00:02:24.912 --> 00:02:27.184
my mother carried
a small bottle of poison.

00:02:28.471 --> 00:02:31.742
If we were captured,
first my sister and I,

00:02:31.766 --> 00:02:33.892
then she and my grandmother would drink.

00:02:35.467 --> 00:02:37.535
My first memories are from the boat --

00:02:38.273 --> 00:02:40.058
the steady beat of the engine,

00:02:40.082 --> 00:02:42.345
the bow dipping into each wave,

00:02:42.917 --> 00:02:44.976
the vast and empty horizon.

00:02:46.045 --> 00:02:48.548
I don't remember the pirates
who came many times,

00:02:48.572 --> 00:02:51.633
but were bluffed by the bravado
of the men on our boat,

00:02:52.634 --> 00:02:56.042
or the engine dying
and failing to start for six hours.

00:02:57.249 --> 00:03:01.148
But I do remember the lights
on the oil rig off the Malaysian coast

00:03:01.783 --> 00:03:04.517
and the young man who collapsed and died,

00:03:04.541 --> 00:03:06.734
the journey's end too much for him,

00:03:08.079 --> 00:03:11.705
and the first apple I tasted,
given to me by the men on the rig.

00:03:12.586 --> 00:03:15.035
No apple has ever tasted the same.

00:03:18.185 --> 00:03:21.866
After three months in a refugee camp,
we landed in Melbourne.

00:03:22.247 --> 00:03:24.767
And the next piece of the jigsaw
is about four women

00:03:24.791 --> 00:03:28.289
across three generations
shaping a new life together.

00:03:30.115 --> 00:03:32.138
We settled in Footscray,

00:03:32.162 --> 00:03:35.975
a working-class suburb
whose demographic is layers of immigrants.

00:03:36.511 --> 00:03:40.812
Unlike the settled middle-class suburbs,
whose existence I was oblivious of,

00:03:40.836 --> 00:03:43.410
there was no sense
of entitlement in Footscray.

00:03:43.903 --> 00:03:47.085
The smells from shop doors
were from the rest of the world.

00:03:47.109 --> 00:03:48.793
And the snippets of halting English

00:03:48.817 --> 00:03:52.049
were exchanged between people
who had one thing in common:

00:03:52.484 --> 00:03:53.833
They were starting again.

00:03:55.453 --> 00:03:57.288
My mother worked on farms,

00:03:57.312 --> 00:03:58.950
then on a car assembly line,

00:03:58.974 --> 00:04:01.291
working six days, double shifts.

00:04:02.134 --> 00:04:04.242
Somehow, she found time to study English

00:04:04.266 --> 00:04:06.237
and gain IT qualifications.

00:04:07.254 --> 00:04:08.404
We were poor.

00:04:09.364 --> 00:04:11.116
All the dollars were allocated

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:14.538
and extra tuition in English
and mathematics was budgeted for

00:04:14.562 --> 00:04:16.314
regardless of what missed out,

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:19.538
which was usually new clothes;

00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:21.953
they were always secondhand.

00:04:22.341 --> 00:04:24.327
Two pairs of stockings for school,

00:04:24.351 --> 00:04:26.331
each to hide the holes in the other.

00:04:26.974 --> 00:04:30.986
A school uniform down to the ankles,
because it had to last for six years.

00:04:32.756 --> 00:04:36.717
And there were rare
but searing chants of "slit-eye"

00:04:36.741 --> 00:04:38.471
and the occasional graffiti:

00:04:38.495 --> 00:04:39.765
"Asian, go home."

00:04:40.686 --> 00:04:41.976
Go home to where?

00:04:42.969 --> 00:04:44.786
Something stiffened inside me.

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:48.391
There was a gathering of resolve
and a quiet voice saying,

00:04:48.801 --> 00:04:50.137
"I will bypass you."

00:04:51.984 --> 00:04:55.487
My mother, my sister and I
slept in the same bed.

00:04:56.651 --> 00:04:58.888
My mother was exhausted each night,

00:04:58.912 --> 00:05:00.969
but we told one another about our day

00:05:00.993 --> 00:05:04.583
and listened to the movements
of my grandmother around the house.

00:05:05.155 --> 00:05:07.942
My mother suffered from nightmares,
all about the boat.

00:05:09.488 --> 00:05:12.502
And my job was to stay awake
until her nightmares came

00:05:12.526 --> 00:05:13.697
so I could wake her.

00:05:16.041 --> 00:05:17.853
She opened a computer store,

00:05:17.877 --> 00:05:20.706
then studied to be a beautician
and opened another business.

00:05:21.479 --> 00:05:23.258
And the women came with their stories

00:05:23.282 --> 00:05:25.918
about men who could not
make the transition,

00:05:25.942 --> 00:05:27.696
angry and inflexible,

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:30.545
and troubled children
caught between two worlds.

00:05:31.164 --> 00:05:33.177
Grants and sponsors were sought.

00:05:33.201 --> 00:05:34.707
Centers were established.

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:37.691
I lived in parallel worlds.

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:41.118
In one, I was the classic Asian student,

00:05:41.142 --> 00:05:43.659
relentless in the demands
that I made on myself.

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:47.665
In the other, I was enmeshed
in lives that were precarious,

00:05:47.689 --> 00:05:51.418
tragically scarred by violence,
drug abuse and isolation.

00:05:52.719 --> 00:05:54.757
But so many over the years were helped.

00:05:54.781 --> 00:05:57.693
And for that work,
when I was a final-year law student,

00:05:57.717 --> 00:06:00.278
I was chosen as the Young
Australian of the Year.

00:06:00.302 --> 00:06:04.230
And I was catapulted from
one piece of the jigsaw to another,

00:06:04.254 --> 00:06:05.976
and their edges didn't fit.

00:06:06.813 --> 00:06:09.060
Tan Le, anonymous Footscray resident,

00:06:09.084 --> 00:06:12.413
was now Tan Le,
refugee and social activist,

00:06:12.437 --> 00:06:15.858
invited to speak in venues
she had never heard of

00:06:15.882 --> 00:06:19.376
and into homes whose existence
she could never have imagined.

00:06:20.313 --> 00:06:21.969
I didn't know the protocols.

00:06:22.405 --> 00:06:24.185
I didn't know how to use the cutlery.

00:06:25.114 --> 00:06:27.480
I didn't know how to talk about wine.

00:06:27.504 --> 00:06:30.214
I didn't know how to talk about anything.

00:06:31.436 --> 00:06:34.353
I wanted to retreat
to the routines and comfort

00:06:34.377 --> 00:06:36.975
of life in an unsung suburb --

00:06:37.485 --> 00:06:40.107
a grandmother, a mother and two daughters

00:06:40.131 --> 00:06:43.820
ending each day as they had
for almost 20 years,

00:06:43.844 --> 00:06:46.296
telling one another the story of their day

00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:49.860
and falling asleep,
the three of us still in the same bed.

00:06:52.138 --> 00:06:54.158
I told my mother I couldn't do it.

00:06:55.714 --> 00:06:59.162
She reminded me that I was now
the same age she had been

00:06:59.186 --> 00:07:00.630
when we boarded the boat.

00:07:01.548 --> 00:07:03.328
"No" had never been an option.

00:07:04.879 --> 00:07:06.206
"Just do it," she said,

00:07:06.230 --> 00:07:07.908
"and don't be what you're not."

00:07:09.137 --> 00:07:12.361
So I spoke out on youth
unemployment and education

00:07:12.385 --> 00:07:15.463
and the neglect of the marginalized
and disenfranchised.

00:07:15.876 --> 00:07:19.241
And the more candidly I spoke,
the more I was asked to speak.

00:07:21.257 --> 00:07:23.329
I met people from all walks of life,

00:07:23.353 --> 00:07:25.903
so many of them doing
the thing they loved,

00:07:25.927 --> 00:07:27.976
living on the frontiers of possibility.

00:07:28.574 --> 00:07:30.976
And even though I finished my degree,

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:34.297
I realized I could not settle
into a career in law.

00:07:34.677 --> 00:07:36.976
There had to be another piece
of the jigsaw.

00:07:37.946 --> 00:07:40.278
And I realized, at the same time,

00:07:40.302 --> 00:07:42.950
that it is OK to be an outsider,

00:07:42.974 --> 00:07:44.712
a recent arrival,

00:07:44.736 --> 00:07:45.976
new on the scene --

00:07:46.625 --> 00:07:48.353
and not just OK,

00:07:48.377 --> 00:07:50.647
but something to be thankful for,

00:07:50.671 --> 00:07:52.359
perhaps a gift from the boat.

00:07:53.292 --> 00:07:57.866
Because being an insider can so easily
mean collapsing the horizons,

00:07:57.890 --> 00:08:01.470
can so easily mean accepting
the presumptions of your province.

00:08:02.968 --> 00:08:05.375
I have stepped outside
my comfort zone enough now

00:08:05.399 --> 00:08:08.119
to know that, yes,
the world does fall apart,

00:08:08.143 --> 00:08:09.976
but not in the way that you fear.

00:08:10.553 --> 00:08:12.833
Possibilities that would not
have been allowed

00:08:12.857 --> 00:08:14.618
were outrageously encouraged.

00:08:15.036 --> 00:08:16.511
There was an energy there,

00:08:16.535 --> 00:08:17.976
an implacable optimism,

00:08:18.614 --> 00:08:21.286
a strange mixture of humility and daring.

00:08:22.306 --> 00:08:23.731
So I followed my hunches.

00:08:24.077 --> 00:08:26.563
I gathered around me
a small team of people

00:08:26.587 --> 00:08:30.232
for whom the label "It can't be done"
was an irresistible challenge.

00:08:31.375 --> 00:08:32.976
For a year, we were penniless.

00:08:33.412 --> 00:08:35.754
At the end of each day,
I made a huge pot of soup

00:08:35.778 --> 00:08:37.151
which we all shared.

00:08:37.947 --> 00:08:39.834
We worked well into each night.

00:08:40.328 --> 00:08:41.975
Most of our ideas were crazy,

00:08:42.613 --> 00:08:43.976
but a few were brilliant,

00:08:44.445 --> 00:08:45.778
and we broke through.

00:08:47.549 --> 00:08:50.854
I made the decision to move
to the US after only one trip.

00:08:51.720 --> 00:08:52.976
My hunches again.

00:08:53.666 --> 00:08:57.509
Three months later, I had relocated,
and the adventure has continued.

00:08:59.657 --> 00:09:02.716
Before I close, though,
let me tell you about my grandmother.

00:09:04.018 --> 00:09:07.641
She grew up at a time when Confucianism
was the social norm

00:09:07.665 --> 00:09:10.236
and the local mandarin
was the person who mattered.

00:09:10.947 --> 00:09:12.976
Life hadn't changed for centuries.

00:09:14.049 --> 00:09:16.740
Her father died soon after she was born.

00:09:17.676 --> 00:09:19.430
Her mother raised her alone.

00:09:20.692 --> 00:09:25.382
At 17, she became the second wife
of a mandarin whose mother beat her.

00:09:26.731 --> 00:09:28.725
With no support from her husband,

00:09:28.749 --> 00:09:31.455
she caused a sensation
by taking him to court

00:09:31.479 --> 00:09:33.711
and prosecuting her own case,

00:09:33.735 --> 00:09:36.462
and a far greater sensation when she won.

00:09:36.486 --> 00:09:37.976
(Laughter)

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:43.047
(Applause)

00:09:43.071 --> 00:09:45.460
"It can't be done" was shown to be wrong.

00:09:48.625 --> 00:09:51.653
I was taking a shower
in a hotel room in Sydney

00:09:51.677 --> 00:09:53.236
the moment she died,

00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:55.768
600 miles away, in Melbourne.

00:09:57.103 --> 00:10:01.234
I looked through the shower screen
and saw her standing on the other side.

00:10:01.258 --> 00:10:03.233
I knew she had come to say goodbye.

00:10:03.955 --> 00:10:05.803
My mother phoned minutes later.

00:10:07.316 --> 00:10:08.606
A few days later,

00:10:08.630 --> 00:10:11.975
we went to a Buddhist temple in Footscray
and sat around her casket.

00:10:12.976 --> 00:10:16.395
We told her stories and assured her
that we were still with her.

00:10:17.725 --> 00:10:22.421
At midnight, the monk came
and told us he had to close the casket.

00:10:23.398 --> 00:10:25.792
My mother asked us to feel her hand.

00:10:26.554 --> 00:10:27.976
She asked the monk,

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:32.441
"Why is it that her hand is so warm
and the rest of her is so cold?"

00:10:33.678 --> 00:10:36.976
"Because you have been holding it
since this morning," he said.

00:10:37.679 --> 00:10:39.218
"You have not let it go."

00:10:42.242 --> 00:10:46.051
If there is a sinew in our family,
it runs through the women.

00:10:47.100 --> 00:10:50.053
Given who we were
and how life had shaped us,

00:10:50.077 --> 00:10:53.419
we can now see that the men
that might have come into our lives

00:10:53.443 --> 00:10:54.759
would have thwarted us.

00:10:55.366 --> 00:10:57.346
Defeat would have come too easily.

00:10:58.590 --> 00:11:02.515
Now I would like to have my own children,
and I wonder about the boat.

00:11:03.792 --> 00:11:05.863
Who could ever wish it on their own?

00:11:06.937 --> 00:11:09.083
Yet I am afraid of privilege,

00:11:09.107 --> 00:11:10.313
of ease,

00:11:10.337 --> 00:11:11.573
of entitlement.

00:11:12.457 --> 00:11:16.470
Can I give them a bow in their lives,
dipping bravely into each wave,

00:11:17.518 --> 00:11:19.976
the unperturbed and steady
beat of the engine,

00:11:20.889 --> 00:11:23.636
the vast horizon that guarantees nothing?

00:11:25.439 --> 00:11:26.636
I don't know.

00:11:27.232 --> 00:11:28.629
But if I could give it

00:11:28.653 --> 00:11:30.967
and still see them safely through,

00:11:30.991 --> 00:11:32.141
I would.

00:11:33.325 --> 00:11:40.325
(Applause)

00:11:46.094 --> 00:11:49.358
Trevor Neilson: And also,
Tan's mother is here today,

00:11:49.382 --> 00:11:50.976
in the fourth or fifth row.

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:55.792
(Applause)
