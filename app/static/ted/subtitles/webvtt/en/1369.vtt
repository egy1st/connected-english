00:00:01.041 --> 00:00:05.371
TED has already persuaded me
to change my life in one small way,

00:00:05.395 --> 00:00:08.742
by persuading me to change
the opening of my speech.

00:00:08.766 --> 00:00:11.841
I love this idea of engagement.

00:00:11.865 --> 00:00:14.073
So, when you leave here today,

00:00:14.097 --> 00:00:18.023
I'm going to ask you
to engage or re-engage

00:00:18.047 --> 00:00:20.809
with some of the most important
people in your lives:

00:00:20.833 --> 00:00:22.292
your brothers and sisters.

00:00:22.879 --> 00:00:26.898
It can be a profoundly
life-affirming thing to do,

00:00:26.922 --> 00:00:28.739
even if it isn't always easy.

00:00:29.938 --> 00:00:32.411
This is a man named Elliot,

00:00:32.435 --> 00:00:35.387
for whom things were very difficult.

00:00:35.411 --> 00:00:37.151
Elliot was a drunk.

00:00:37.175 --> 00:00:41.149
He spent most of his life
battling alcoholism,

00:00:41.173 --> 00:00:43.768
depression, morphine addiction,

00:00:43.792 --> 00:00:47.195
and that life ended
when he was just 34 years old.

00:00:47.806 --> 00:00:52.229
What made things harder for Elliot
is that his last name was Roosevelt.

00:00:52.253 --> 00:00:55.112
And he could never quite
get past the comparisons

00:00:55.136 --> 00:00:56.851
with his big brother Teddy,

00:00:56.875 --> 00:00:59.972
for whom things always seemed
to come a little bit easier.

00:01:01.083 --> 00:01:03.683
It wasn't easy being Bobby, either.

00:01:03.707 --> 00:01:05.928
He was also the sibling of a president.

00:01:05.952 --> 00:01:08.303
But he adored his brother, Jack.

00:01:08.327 --> 00:01:09.787
He fought for him,

00:01:09.811 --> 00:01:11.371
he worked for him.

00:01:11.395 --> 00:01:14.375
And when Jack died, he bled for him, too.

00:01:15.244 --> 00:01:18.699
In the years that followed,
Bobby would smile,

00:01:18.723 --> 00:01:20.354
but it seemed labored.

00:01:20.378 --> 00:01:22.485
He'd lose himself in his work,

00:01:22.509 --> 00:01:24.469
but it seemed tortured.

00:01:24.493 --> 00:01:28.194
Bobby's own death, so similar to John's,

00:01:28.218 --> 00:01:29.736
seems somehow fitting.

00:01:30.337 --> 00:01:33.524
John Kennedy was robbed of his young life;

00:01:33.548 --> 00:01:37.215
Bobby seemed almost
to have been relieved of his.

00:01:38.324 --> 00:01:42.831
There may be no relationship
that effects us more profoundly,

00:01:42.855 --> 00:01:46.199
that's closer, finer, harder,

00:01:46.223 --> 00:01:49.347
sweeter, happier, sadder,

00:01:49.371 --> 00:01:52.349
more filled with joy or fraught with woe

00:01:52.373 --> 00:01:55.639
than the relationship we have
with our brothers and sisters.

00:01:56.114 --> 00:01:58.853
There's power in the sibling bond.

00:02:00.174 --> 00:02:01.692
There's pageantry.

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:04.914
There's petulance, too,

00:02:04.938 --> 00:02:07.381
as when Neil Bush,

00:02:07.405 --> 00:02:11.314
sibling of both a president
and a governor, famously griped,

00:02:11.338 --> 00:02:16.460
"I've lost patience for being compared
to my older brothers,"

00:02:16.484 --> 00:02:20.291
as if Jeb and George W
were somehow responsible

00:02:20.315 --> 00:02:23.179
for the savings and loan scandal
and the messy divorce

00:02:23.203 --> 00:02:25.894
that marked Neil in the public eye.

00:02:27.264 --> 00:02:29.950
But more important
than all of these things,

00:02:29.974 --> 00:02:33.195
the sibling bond can be
a thing of abiding love.

00:02:33.219 --> 00:02:35.022
Our parents leave us too early,

00:02:35.635 --> 00:02:39.012
our spouse and our children
come along too late.

00:02:39.036 --> 00:02:42.074
Our siblings are the only ones
who are with us

00:02:42.098 --> 00:02:43.574
for the entire ride.

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:46.927
Over the arc of decades,
there may be nothing

00:02:46.951 --> 00:02:50.476
that defines us and forms us
more powerfully

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:53.699
than our relationship
with our sisters and brothers.

00:02:53.723 --> 00:02:55.707
It was true for me,

00:02:55.731 --> 00:02:57.785
it's true for your children

00:02:57.809 --> 00:03:00.293
and if you have siblings,
it's true for you, too.

00:03:01.227 --> 00:03:05.169
This picture was taken when Steve,
on the left, was eight years old.

00:03:05.193 --> 00:03:10.152
I was six, our brother Gary was five
and my brother Bruce was four.

00:03:10.176 --> 00:03:12.326
I will not say what year it was taken.

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:13.943
It was not this year.

00:03:13.967 --> 00:03:15.284
(Laughter)

00:03:15.308 --> 00:03:18.067
I open my new book, "The Sibling Effect,"

00:03:18.091 --> 00:03:19.555
on a Saturday morning,

00:03:19.579 --> 00:03:21.967
not long before this picture was taken,

00:03:21.991 --> 00:03:25.711
when the three older brothers decided
that it might be a very good idea

00:03:25.735 --> 00:03:29.218
to lock the younger brother
in a fuse cabinet in our playroom.

00:03:29.242 --> 00:03:30.376
(Laughter)

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:34.083
We were, believe it or not,
trying to keep him safe.

00:03:35.195 --> 00:03:38.134
Our father was a hotheaded man,

00:03:38.158 --> 00:03:42.799
somebody who didn't take kindly
to being disturbed on Saturday mornings.

00:03:42.823 --> 00:03:46.338
I don't know what he thought his life
would be like on Saturday mornings

00:03:46.362 --> 00:03:47.517
when he had four sons,

00:03:47.541 --> 00:03:50.586
ages four years old or younger
when the youngest one was born,

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:52.248
but they weren't quiet.

00:03:52.272 --> 00:03:54.028
He did not take to that well.

00:03:54.488 --> 00:03:58.063
And he would react to being
disturbed on a Saturday morning

00:03:58.087 --> 00:03:59.973
by stalking into the playroom

00:03:59.997 --> 00:04:03.909
and administering a very freewheeling
form of a corporal punishment,

00:04:03.933 --> 00:04:06.908
lashing out at whoever
was within arms' reach.

00:04:07.938 --> 00:04:11.490
We were by no means battered children
but we did get hit,

00:04:11.514 --> 00:04:13.123
and we found it terrifying.

00:04:13.784 --> 00:04:16.754
So we devised a sort of
scatter-and-hide drill.

00:04:16.778 --> 00:04:17.813
(Laughter)

00:04:17.837 --> 00:04:21.739
As soon as we saw or heard
the footsteps coming,

00:04:21.763 --> 00:04:24.732
Steve, the oldest, would wriggle
under the couch,

00:04:24.756 --> 00:04:28.400
I would dive into the closet
in the playroom,

00:04:28.424 --> 00:04:31.339
Gary would dive into
a window-seat toy chest,

00:04:31.363 --> 00:04:34.888
but not before we closed
Bruce inside the fuse box.

00:04:34.912 --> 00:04:37.759
We told him it was
Alan Shepard's space capsule,

00:04:37.783 --> 00:04:39.546
and that somehow made it work better.

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:41.711
(Laughter)

00:04:41.735 --> 00:04:45.448
I dare say my father was never
fooled by this ruse.

00:04:45.472 --> 00:04:48.194
And it was only in later
years that I began to think

00:04:48.218 --> 00:04:51.183
perhaps it wasn't a good idea
to squeeze a four-year-old

00:04:51.207 --> 00:04:56.275
up against a panel of old-style,
un-screwable high-voltage fuses.

00:04:56.299 --> 00:04:57.738
(Laughter)

00:04:57.762 --> 00:05:02.237
But my brothers and I,
even through those unhappy times,

00:05:02.261 --> 00:05:07.560
came through them, with something
that was clear and hard and fine:

00:05:07.584 --> 00:05:11.208
a primal appreciation
for the bond we shared.

00:05:11.639 --> 00:05:15.356
We were a unit -- a loud, messy

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:18.195
brawling, loyal, loving,

00:05:18.219 --> 00:05:19.635
lasting unit.

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:24.800
We felt much stronger that way
than we ever could as individuals.

00:05:24.824 --> 00:05:27.301
And we knew that as our lives went on,

00:05:27.325 --> 00:05:29.850
we could always be able
to call on that strength.

00:05:31.299 --> 00:05:32.682
We're not alone.

00:05:32.706 --> 00:05:34.484
Until 15 years ago,

00:05:34.508 --> 00:05:37.862
scientists didn't really pay much
attention to the sibling bond.

00:05:37.886 --> 00:05:39.125
And with good reason:

00:05:39.149 --> 00:05:42.275
you have just one mother,
you have just one father

00:05:42.299 --> 00:05:45.599
if you do marriage right,
you have one spouse for life.

00:05:45.623 --> 00:05:48.201
Siblings can claim
none of that uniqueness.

00:05:48.225 --> 00:05:52.610
They're interchangeable, fungible,
a kind of household commodity.

00:05:52.634 --> 00:05:56.895
Parents set up shop and begin stocking
their shelves with inventory,

00:05:56.919 --> 00:05:59.956
the only limitation being sperm,
egg and economics.

00:05:59.980 --> 00:06:00.987
(Laughter)

00:06:01.011 --> 00:06:04.408
As long as you can keep breathing,
you may as well keep stocking.

00:06:04.432 --> 00:06:08.112
Now, nature is perfectly happy
with that arrangement,

00:06:08.136 --> 00:06:10.824
because our primal directive here

00:06:10.848 --> 00:06:14.556
is to get as many of our genes
as possible into the next generation.

00:06:15.581 --> 00:06:18.377
Animals wrestle with
these same issues, too,

00:06:18.401 --> 00:06:21.829
but they have a more straightforward way
of dealing with things.

00:06:21.853 --> 00:06:25.540
A crested penguin that has laid two eggs
will take a good look at them

00:06:25.564 --> 00:06:28.199
and boot the smaller one out of the nest,

00:06:28.223 --> 00:06:31.885
the better to focus her attentions
on the presumably heartier chick

00:06:31.909 --> 00:06:33.308
in the bigger shell.

00:06:34.366 --> 00:06:37.624
A black eagle will allow
all of her chicks to hatch

00:06:37.648 --> 00:06:41.575
and then stand back while the bigger ones
fight it out with the little ones,

00:06:41.599 --> 00:06:43.270
typically ripping them to ribbons

00:06:43.294 --> 00:06:45.467
and then settling back
to grow up in peace.

00:06:46.587 --> 00:06:48.691
Piglets, cute as they are,

00:06:48.715 --> 00:06:52.820
are born with a strange
little outward set of pointing teeth,

00:06:52.844 --> 00:06:54.731
that they use to jab at one another

00:06:54.755 --> 00:06:57.558
as they compete
for the choicest nursing spots.

00:06:59.685 --> 00:07:01.283
The problem for scientists

00:07:01.892 --> 00:07:06.773
was that this whole idea of siblings
as second-class citizens

00:07:06.797 --> 00:07:09.634
never really seemed to hold up.

00:07:10.046 --> 00:07:13.672
After the researchers
had learned all they could

00:07:13.696 --> 00:07:19.616
from the relationships in the family,
mothers and other relationships,

00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:22.851
they still came up with some
temperamental dark matter

00:07:22.875 --> 00:07:24.218
that was pulling at us,

00:07:24.242 --> 00:07:26.397
exerting a gravity all its own.

00:07:26.421 --> 00:07:28.753
And that could only be our siblings.

00:07:29.806 --> 00:07:33.818
Humans are no different from animals.

00:07:33.842 --> 00:07:38.118
After we are born, we do whatever we can

00:07:38.142 --> 00:07:40.216
to attract the attention of our parents,

00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:43.436
determining what our strongest
selling points are

00:07:43.460 --> 00:07:45.751
and marketing them ferociously.

00:07:45.775 --> 00:07:48.331
Someone's the funny one,
someone's the pretty one,

00:07:48.355 --> 00:07:52.537
someone's the athlete,
someone's the smart one.

00:07:53.625 --> 00:07:56.026
Scientists call this "deidentification."

00:07:56.588 --> 00:07:59.255
If my older brother
is a high-school football player --

00:07:59.279 --> 00:08:02.190
which, if you saw my older
brother, you'd know he was not --

00:08:02.214 --> 00:08:04.764
I could become a high-school
football player, too

00:08:04.788 --> 00:08:10.375
and get at most 50 percent of the applause
in my family for doing that.

00:08:10.399 --> 00:08:13.916
Or, I could become student
council president

00:08:13.940 --> 00:08:15.911
or specialize in the arts

00:08:15.935 --> 00:08:18.954
and get 100 percent
of the attention in that area.

00:08:19.917 --> 00:08:23.779
Sometimes parents contaminate
the deidentification process,

00:08:23.803 --> 00:08:26.450
communicating to their kids subtly or not,

00:08:26.474 --> 00:08:30.778
that only certain kinds of accomplishments
will be applauded in the home.

00:08:31.556 --> 00:08:34.080
Joe Kennedy was famous for this,

00:08:34.104 --> 00:08:36.258
making it clear to his nine children

00:08:36.282 --> 00:08:39.456
that they were expected to compete
with one another in athletics

00:08:39.480 --> 00:08:41.731
and were expected to win,

00:08:41.755 --> 00:08:44.965
lest they be made to eat
in the kitchen with the help,

00:08:44.989 --> 00:08:47.798
rather than in the dining room
with the family.

00:08:48.934 --> 00:08:50.111
It's no wonder

00:08:50.135 --> 00:08:54.793
that scrawny second-born Jack Kennedy
fought so hard to compete

00:08:54.817 --> 00:08:57.212
with his fitter firstborn brother, Joe,

00:08:57.236 --> 00:08:58.778
often at his peril,

00:08:58.802 --> 00:09:02.251
at one point, engaging
in a bicycle race around the house

00:09:02.275 --> 00:09:06.639
that resulted in a collision
costing John 28 stitches.

00:09:06.663 --> 00:09:09.096
Joe walked away essentially unharmed.

00:09:10.134 --> 00:09:13.049
Parents exacerbate this problem further

00:09:13.073 --> 00:09:15.645
when they exhibit favoritism,

00:09:15.669 --> 00:09:20.183
which they do overwhelmingly,
no matter how much they admit it.

00:09:20.207 --> 00:09:24.776
A study I cite in this TIME magazine
covering in the book "The Sibling Effect,"

00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:29.731
found 70 percent of fathers
and 65 percent of mothers

00:09:29.755 --> 00:09:32.934
exhibit a preference
for at least one child.

00:09:32.958 --> 00:09:36.830
And keep in mind here --
the keyword is "exhibit."

00:09:36.854 --> 00:09:41.317
The remaining parents may simply be doing
a better job of concealing things.

00:09:41.341 --> 00:09:43.207
(Laughter)

00:09:43.231 --> 00:09:48.771
I like to say that 95 percent
of all parents have a favorite,

00:09:48.795 --> 00:09:51.154
five percent are lying about it.

00:09:51.178 --> 00:09:53.069
The exception is my wife and me.

00:09:53.093 --> 00:09:55.764
Honestly, we do not have a favorite.

00:09:55.788 --> 00:09:57.869
(Laughter)

00:09:57.893 --> 00:10:01.473
It's not parents' fault that they harbor
feelings of favoritism.

00:10:01.497 --> 00:10:04.607
And here, too, our natural
wiring is at work.

00:10:05.116 --> 00:10:09.743
Firstborns are the first products
on the familial assembly line.

00:10:09.767 --> 00:10:14.716
Parents typically get two years
of investing dollars, calories

00:10:14.740 --> 00:10:17.070
and so many other resources in them,

00:10:17.094 --> 00:10:20.162
so that by the time
the second born comes along,

00:10:20.186 --> 00:10:24.459
the firstborn is already ...
it's what corporations call "sunk costs,"

00:10:24.483 --> 00:10:26.884
you don't want to disinvest in this one

00:10:26.908 --> 00:10:28.930
and launch the R&amp;D on the new product.

00:10:28.954 --> 00:10:30.017
(Laughter)

00:10:30.041 --> 00:10:35.117
So what we begin to do is say,
"I'm going to lean to the Mac OS X

00:10:35.141 --> 00:10:38.008
and let the Mac OS XI come out
in a couple of years."

00:10:38.032 --> 00:10:39.894
So we tend to lean in that direction.

00:10:39.918 --> 00:10:41.050
(Laughter)

00:10:41.074 --> 00:10:43.459
But there are other forces at work, too.

00:10:43.483 --> 00:10:48.722
One of the same studies I looked at
both here and in the book found that,

00:10:48.746 --> 00:10:55.622
improbably, the most common favorite
for a father is the last-born daughter.

00:10:55.646 --> 00:10:59.516
The most common favorite
for a mother is the firstborn son.

00:10:59.540 --> 00:11:03.142
Now, this isn't Oedipal; never mind
what the Freudians would have told us

00:11:03.166 --> 00:11:04.325
a hundred years ago.

00:11:04.349 --> 00:11:07.225
And it's not just that fathers
are habitually wrapped around

00:11:07.249 --> 00:11:08.898
the fingers of their little girls,

00:11:08.922 --> 00:11:11.581
though I can tell you that,
as the father of two girls,

00:11:11.605 --> 00:11:13.580
that part definitely plays a role.

00:11:14.735 --> 00:11:18.746
Rather, there is a certain
reproductive narcissism at work.

00:11:18.770 --> 00:11:23.582
Your opposite-gender kids

00:11:23.606 --> 00:11:27.319
can never resemble you exactly.

00:11:27.343 --> 00:11:30.727
But if somehow they can resemble
you temperamentally,

00:11:30.751 --> 00:11:32.463
you'll love them all the more.

00:11:32.487 --> 00:11:37.510
As the result, the father
who is a businessman will just melt

00:11:37.534 --> 00:11:43.167
at the idea of his MBA daughter
with a tough-as-nails worldview.

00:11:43.191 --> 00:11:47.308
The mother who is a sensitive type
will go gooey over her son the poet.

00:11:47.332 --> 00:11:49.226
(Laughter)

00:11:49.250 --> 00:11:52.611
Birth order, another topic
I covered for TIME,

00:11:52.635 --> 00:11:56.410
and another topic I cover in the book,

00:11:56.434 --> 00:11:58.437
plays out in other ways as well.

00:11:58.461 --> 00:12:01.640
Long before scientists
began looking at this,

00:12:01.664 --> 00:12:05.114
parents noticed that there are
certain temperamental templates

00:12:05.138 --> 00:12:07.337
associated with all birth rankings:

00:12:07.361 --> 00:12:10.278
the serious, striving firstborn;

00:12:10.302 --> 00:12:12.659
the caught-in-a-thicket's middle born;

00:12:12.683 --> 00:12:15.285
the wild child of a last born.

00:12:15.309 --> 00:12:17.930
And once again, when science
did crack this field,

00:12:17.954 --> 00:12:20.298
they found out mom and dad are right.

00:12:20.322 --> 00:12:24.721
Firstborns across history have tended
to be bigger and healthier

00:12:24.745 --> 00:12:26.015
than later borns,

00:12:26.039 --> 00:12:28.545
in part, because of the head start
they got on food

00:12:28.569 --> 00:12:30.994
in an area in which it could be scarce.

00:12:31.018 --> 00:12:34.573
Firstborns are also
vaccinated more reliably

00:12:34.597 --> 00:12:38.092
and tend to have more
follow-up visits to doctors

00:12:38.116 --> 00:12:39.388
when they get sick.

00:12:39.412 --> 00:12:41.539
And this pattern continues today.

00:12:41.563 --> 00:12:45.567
This IQ question is, sadly -- I can
say this as a second-born --

00:12:45.591 --> 00:12:47.280
a very real thing.

00:12:47.304 --> 00:12:51.053
Firstborns have a three-point
IQ advantage over second borns

00:12:51.077 --> 00:12:55.006
and second borns have a 1.5 IQ
advantage over later borns,

00:12:55.030 --> 00:12:59.489
partly because of the exclusive attention
firstborns get from mom and dad,

00:12:59.513 --> 00:13:03.522
and partly because they get a chance
to mentor the younger kids.

00:13:04.202 --> 00:13:08.142
All of this explains why firstborns
are likelier to be CEOs,

00:13:08.166 --> 00:13:09.798
they are likelier to be senators,

00:13:09.822 --> 00:13:11.615
they are likelier to be astronauts,

00:13:11.639 --> 00:13:14.676
and they are likelier to earn more
than other kids are.

00:13:15.936 --> 00:13:20.505
Last borns come into the world
with a whole different set of challenges.

00:13:20.529 --> 00:13:23.188
The smallest and weakest cubs in the den,

00:13:23.212 --> 00:13:26.272
they're at the greatest risk
of getting eaten alive,

00:13:26.296 --> 00:13:29.549
so they have to develop
what are called "low-power skills" --

00:13:29.573 --> 00:13:31.977
the ability to charm and disarm,

00:13:32.001 --> 00:13:34.906
to intuit what's going on
in someone else's head,

00:13:34.930 --> 00:13:37.525
the better to duck
the punch before it lands.

00:13:37.549 --> 00:13:38.922
(Laughter)

00:13:38.946 --> 00:13:41.603
They're also flat-out funnier,

00:13:41.627 --> 00:13:43.850
which is another thing
that comes in handy,

00:13:43.874 --> 00:13:47.802
because a person who's making you laugh
is a very hard person to slug.

00:13:47.826 --> 00:13:48.982
(Laughter)

00:13:49.006 --> 00:13:52.880
It's perhaps no coincidence
that over the course of history,

00:13:52.904 --> 00:13:54.945
some of our greatest satirists --

00:13:54.969 --> 00:13:56.145
Swift,

00:13:56.621 --> 00:13:57.787
Twain,

00:13:58.396 --> 00:13:59.681
Voltaire,

00:14:00.592 --> 00:14:01.795
Colbert --

00:14:01.819 --> 00:14:03.906
(Laughter)

00:14:03.930 --> 00:14:05.793
are either the last borns

00:14:05.817 --> 00:14:08.976
or among the last in very large families.

00:14:09.657 --> 00:14:12.441
Most middle borns don't get
quite as sweet a deal.

00:14:12.465 --> 00:14:14.683
I think of us as the flyover states.

00:14:14.707 --> 00:14:16.356
We are --

00:14:16.380 --> 00:14:19.160
(Laughter)

00:14:19.184 --> 00:14:23.009
we're the ones who fight harder
for recognition in the home.

00:14:23.033 --> 00:14:26.117
We're the ones who are always
raising our hands

00:14:26.141 --> 00:14:29.146
while someone else at the table
is getting called on.

00:14:29.170 --> 00:14:31.806
We're the ones who tend
to take a little longer

00:14:31.830 --> 00:14:34.028
to find their direction in life.

00:14:34.052 --> 00:14:37.460
And there can be self-esteem
issues associated with that,

00:14:37.484 --> 00:14:40.185
notwithstanding the fact
that I've been asked to do TED,

00:14:40.209 --> 00:14:42.702
so I feel much better
about these things right now.

00:14:42.726 --> 00:14:43.729
(Laughter)

00:14:43.753 --> 00:14:48.490
But the upside for middle borns
is that they also tend to develop

00:14:48.514 --> 00:14:52.118
denser and richer relationships
outside the home.

00:14:52.142 --> 00:14:55.383
But that advantage comes also
from something of a disadvantage,

00:14:55.407 --> 00:14:58.576
simply because their needs
weren't met as well in the home.

00:14:59.751 --> 00:15:03.160
The feuds in the playroom
that play out over favoritism,

00:15:03.184 --> 00:15:05.759
birth order and so many other issues

00:15:05.783 --> 00:15:07.624
are as unrelenting as they seem.

00:15:08.115 --> 00:15:10.576
In one study I cite in the book,

00:15:10.600 --> 00:15:13.402
children in the two-to-four age group

00:15:13.426 --> 00:15:19.002
engage in one fight every 6.3 minutes,

00:15:19.026 --> 00:15:21.622
or 9.5 fights an hour.

00:15:22.326 --> 00:15:25.050
That's not fighting --
that's performance art.

00:15:25.074 --> 00:15:26.102
(Laughter)

00:15:26.126 --> 00:15:27.904
That's extraordinary.

00:15:28.939 --> 00:15:32.849
One reason for this is that there are
a lot more people in your home

00:15:32.873 --> 00:15:34.234
than you think there are,

00:15:34.258 --> 00:15:36.751
or at least a lot more relationships.

00:15:36.775 --> 00:15:41.057
Every person in your house has
a discrete one-on-one relationship

00:15:41.081 --> 00:15:42.461
with every other person,

00:15:42.485 --> 00:15:45.851
and those pairings or dyads add up fast.

00:15:46.344 --> 00:15:51.508
In a family with two parents and two kids,
there are six dyads:

00:15:51.532 --> 00:15:54.191
Mom has a relationship with child A and B,

00:15:54.215 --> 00:15:57.017
Dad has a relationship with child A and B.

00:15:57.041 --> 00:15:58.812
There's the marital relationship,

00:15:58.836 --> 00:16:02.184
and there is the relationship
between the kids themselves.

00:16:02.208 --> 00:16:05.679
The formula for this
looks very chilly but it's real.

00:16:05.703 --> 00:16:10.572
K equals the number of people
in your household,

00:16:10.596 --> 00:16:13.455
and X equals the number of dyads.

00:16:14.567 --> 00:16:18.142
In a five-person family,
there are ten discrete dyads.

00:16:18.743 --> 00:16:21.979
The eight-person Brady Bunch --
never mind the sweetness here --

00:16:22.003 --> 00:16:24.754
there were 28 dyads in that family.

00:16:25.319 --> 00:16:30.897
The original Kennedy family with nine kids
had 55 different relationships.

00:16:30.921 --> 00:16:34.833
And Bobby Kennedy, who grew up
to have 11 children of his own,

00:16:34.857 --> 00:16:38.493
had a household with a whopping 91 dyads.

00:16:39.133 --> 00:16:42.752
This overpopulation of relationships

00:16:43.493 --> 00:16:46.055
makes fights unavoidable.

00:16:46.079 --> 00:16:51.136
And far and away the biggest trigger
for all sibling fights is property.

00:16:51.617 --> 00:16:56.780
Studies have found that over 95 percent
of the fights among small children

00:16:56.804 --> 00:16:59.822
concern somebody touching, playing with,

00:16:59.846 --> 00:17:02.674
looking at the other person's stuff.

00:17:02.698 --> 00:17:03.701
(Laughter)

00:17:03.725 --> 00:17:08.450
This in its own way is healthy
if it's very noisy,

00:17:08.474 --> 00:17:12.367
and the reason is that small children
come into the world

00:17:12.391 --> 00:17:14.311
with absolutely no control.

00:17:14.335 --> 00:17:16.021
They are utterly helpless.

00:17:16.045 --> 00:17:20.716
The only way they have
of projecting their very limited power

00:17:20.740 --> 00:17:23.348
is through the objects
they can call their own.

00:17:23.372 --> 00:17:26.968
When somebody crosses
that very erasable line,

00:17:26.992 --> 00:17:29.776
they're going to go nuts,
and that's what happens.

00:17:30.762 --> 00:17:36.377
Another very common casus belli
among children is the idea of fairness,

00:17:36.401 --> 00:17:41.007
as any parent who hears 14 times a day,
"But that's unfair!"

00:17:41.031 --> 00:17:42.545
can tell you.

00:17:42.569 --> 00:17:45.007
In a way this is good, too, though.

00:17:45.031 --> 00:17:48.835
Kids are born with a very innate sense
of right and wrong,

00:17:48.859 --> 00:17:51.543
of a fair deal versus an unfair one,

00:17:51.567 --> 00:17:53.822
and this teaches them powerful lessons.

00:17:53.846 --> 00:17:58.935
Do you want to know how powerfully encoded
fairness is in the human genome?

00:17:58.959 --> 00:18:01.557
We process that phenomenon

00:18:01.581 --> 00:18:05.757
through the same lobe in our brain
that processes disgust,

00:18:05.781 --> 00:18:10.543
meaning we react to the idea
of somebody being cheated

00:18:10.567 --> 00:18:13.490
the same way we react to putrefied meat.

00:18:13.514 --> 00:18:14.687
(Laughter)

00:18:14.711 --> 00:18:20.720
Any wonder that this fellow,
Bernie Madoff, is unpopular?

00:18:22.047 --> 00:18:25.282
All of these dramas played out day to day,

00:18:25.306 --> 00:18:26.811
moment to moment,

00:18:26.835 --> 00:18:31.502
serve as a real-time,
total-immersion exercise for life.

00:18:32.045 --> 00:18:36.885
Siblings teach each other conflict
avoidance and conflict resolution,

00:18:36.909 --> 00:18:39.305
when to stand up for themselves,

00:18:39.329 --> 00:18:40.945
when to stand down;

00:18:40.969 --> 00:18:42.601
they learn love,

00:18:42.625 --> 00:18:48.221
loyalty, honesty, sharing,
caring, compromise,

00:18:48.245 --> 00:18:51.620
the disclosure of secrets
and much more important,

00:18:51.644 --> 00:18:53.511
the keeping of confidences.

00:18:55.481 --> 00:18:58.330
I listen to my young daughters --
aren’t they adorable? --

00:18:58.354 --> 00:19:02.717
I listen to my young daughters
talking late into the night,

00:19:02.741 --> 00:19:06.812
the same way my parents, no doubt,
listened to my brothers and me talking,

00:19:06.836 --> 00:19:10.014
and sometimes I intervene,
but usually I don't.

00:19:10.747 --> 00:19:14.124
They're part of a conversation
I am not part of,

00:19:14.148 --> 00:19:16.217
nobody else in the world is part of,

00:19:16.241 --> 00:19:19.833
and it's a conversation
that can and should go on

00:19:19.857 --> 00:19:21.727
for the rest of their lives.

00:19:21.751 --> 00:19:24.529
From this will come a sense of constancy,

00:19:24.553 --> 00:19:27.655
a sense of having a permanent
traveling companion,

00:19:27.679 --> 00:19:30.352
somebody with whom they road-tested life

00:19:30.376 --> 00:19:33.461
before they ever had to get out
and travel it on their own.

00:19:34.550 --> 00:19:38.369
Brothers and sisters aren't
the sine qua non of a happy life;

00:19:38.393 --> 00:19:41.575
plenty of adult sibling
relationships are fatally broken

00:19:41.599 --> 00:19:45.494
and need to be abandoned
for the sanity of everybody involved.

00:19:45.518 --> 00:19:49.862
And only-children, throughout history,
have shown themselves

00:19:49.886 --> 00:19:52.681
to be creatively, brilliantly capable

00:19:52.705 --> 00:19:56.093
of getting their socialization
and comradeship skills

00:19:56.117 --> 00:20:00.056
through friends, through cousins,
through classmates.

00:20:00.080 --> 00:20:04.173
But having siblings and not
making the most of those bonds

00:20:04.197 --> 00:20:07.646
is, I believe, folly of the first order.

00:20:07.670 --> 00:20:12.252
If relationships are broken
and are fixable, fix them.

00:20:12.276 --> 00:20:14.972
If they work, make them even better.

00:20:14.996 --> 00:20:20.166
Failing to do so is a little like having
a thousand acres of fertile farmland

00:20:20.190 --> 00:20:21.873
and never planting it.

00:20:21.897 --> 00:20:25.993
Yes, you can always get your food
at the supermarket,

00:20:26.017 --> 00:20:29.260
but think what you're
allowing to lie fallow.

00:20:29.284 --> 00:20:34.462
Life is short, it's finite,
and it plays for keeps.

00:20:34.486 --> 00:20:39.496
Siblings may be among the richest harvests
of the time we have here.
