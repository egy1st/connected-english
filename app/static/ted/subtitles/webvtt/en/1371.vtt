00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Hi. I'm Kevin Allocca, I'm the trends manager at YouTube,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
and I professionally watch YouTube videos.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
It's true.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
So we're going to talk a little bit today about how videos go viral

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
and then why that even matters.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
We all want to be stars --

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
celebrities, singers, comedians --

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
and when I was younger, that seemed so very, very hard to do.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
But now Web video has made it

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
so that any of us or any of the creative things that we do

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
can become completely famous

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
in a part of our world's culture.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Any one of you could be famous on the Internet

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
by next Saturday.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
But there are over 48 hours of video uploaded to YouTube

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
every minute.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
And of that, only a tiny percentage

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
ever goes viral and gets tons of views and becomes a cultural moment.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
So how does it happen?

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
Three things:

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
tastemakers, communities of participation

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
and unexpectedness.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
All right, let's go.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000
(Video) Bear Vasquez: Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
Oh, my God!

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
Wooo!

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.000
Ohhhhh, wowwww!

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
KA: Last year, Bear Vasquez posted this video

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
that he had shot outside his home in Yosemite National Park.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
In 2010, it was viewed 23 million times.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
(Laughter)

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
This is a chart of what it looked like

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
when it first became popular last summer.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
But he didn't actually set out to make a viral video, Bear.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
He just wanted to share a rainbow.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
Because that's what you do when your name is Yosemite Mountain Bear.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
(Laughter)

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
And he had posted lots of nature videos in fact.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
And this video had actually been posted

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
all the way back in January.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
So what happened here?

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
Jimmy Kimmel actually.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
Jimmy Kimmel posted this tweet

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
that would eventually propel the video to be as popular as it would become.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
Because tastemakers like Jimmy Kimmel

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
introduce us to new and interesting things

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
and bring them to a larger audience.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.000
(Video) Rebecca Black: ♫ It's Friday, Friday. Gotta get down on Friday. ♫

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.000
♫ Everybody's looking forward to the weekend, weekend. ♫

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.000
♫ Friday, Friday. Gettin' down on Friday. ♫

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
KA: So you didn't think that we could actually have this conversation

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
without talking about this video I hope.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000
Rebecca Black's "Friday" is one of the most popular videos of the year.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000
It's been seen nearly 200 million times this year.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
This is a chart of what it looked like.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
And similar to "Double Rainbow,"

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.000
it seems to have just sprouted up out of nowhere.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
So what happened on this day?

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
Well it was a Friday, this is true.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
And if you're wondering about those other spikes, those are also Fridays.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:38.000
(Laughter)

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000
But what about this day,

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
this one particular Friday?

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
Well Tosh.0 picked it up, a lot of blogs starting writing about.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
Michael J. Nelson from Mystery Science Theater

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.000
was one of the first people to post a joke about the video on Twitter.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
But what's important is that an individual or a group of tastemakers

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
took a point of view

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000
and they shared that with a larger audience, accelerating the process.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
And so then this community formed

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
of people who shared this big inside joke

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000
and they started talking about it and doing things with it.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000
And now there are 10,000 parodies of "Friday" on YouTube.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
Even in the first seven days,

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000
there was one parody for every other day of the week.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.000
(Laughter)

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000
Unlike the one-way entertainment of the 20th century,

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000
this community participation

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
is how we become a part of the phenomenon --

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000
either by spreading it or by doing something new with it.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:36.000
(Music)

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000
So "Nyan Cat" is a looped animation

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000
with looped music.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000
It's this, just like this.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:47.000
It's been viewed nearly 50 million times this year.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000
And if you think that that is weird,

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000
you should know that there is a three-hour version of this

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000
that's been viewed four million times.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.000
(Laughter)

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000
Even cats were watching this video.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.000
(Laughter)

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.000
Cats were watching other cats watch this video.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:14.000
(Laughter)

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.000
But what's important here

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000
is the creativity that it inspired

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.000
amongst this techie, geeky Internet culture.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000
There were remixes.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000
(Laughter)

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.000
Someone made an old timey version.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000
(Laughter)

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.000
And then it went international.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:48.000
(Laughter)

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.000
An entire remix community sprouted up

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000
that brought it from being just a stupid joke

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000
to something that we can all actually be a part of.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000
Because we don't just enjoy now,

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000
we participate.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000
And who could have predicted any of this?

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000
Who could have predicted "Double Rainbow" or Rebecca Black

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000
or "Nyan Cat?"

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000
What scripts could you have written

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000
that would have contained this in it?

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000
In a world where over two days of video

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000
get uploaded every minute,

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000
only that which is truly unique and unexpected

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.000
can stand out in the way that these things have.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.000
When a friend of mine told me that I needed to see this great video

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.000
about a guy protesting bicycle fines in New York City,

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000
I admit I wasn't very interested.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.000
(Video) Casey Niestat: So I got a ticket for not riding in the bike lane,

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000
but often there are obstructions

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.000
that keep you from properly riding in the bike lane.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:53.000
(Laughter)

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.000
KA: By being totally surprising and humorous,

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:59.000
Casey Niestat got his funny idea and point

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000
seen five million times.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.000
And so this approach holds

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000
for anything new that we do creatively.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000
And so it all brings us

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.000
to one big question ...

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.000
(Video) Bear Vasquez: What does this mean?

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000
Ohhhh.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.000
(Laughter)

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.000
KA: What does it mean?

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.000
Tastemakers, creative participating communities,

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.000
complete unexpectedness,

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:28.000
these are characteristics of a new kind of media and a new kind of culture

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000
where anyone has access

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000
and the audience defines the popularity.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000
I mean, as mentioned earlier,

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000
one of the biggest stars in the world right now, Justin Bieber,

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.000
got his start on YouTube.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.000
No one has to green-light your idea.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.000
And we all now feel some ownership

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.000
in our own pop culture.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000
And these are not characteristics of old media,

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.000
and they're barely true of the media of today,

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.000
but they will define the entertainment of the future.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000
Thank you.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:58.000
(Applause)
