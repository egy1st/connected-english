00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Let me begin with four words

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
that will provide the context for this week,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
four words that will come to define

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
this century.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Here they are:

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
The Earth is full.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
It's full of us, it's full of our stuff,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
full of our waste, full of our demands.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Yes, we are a brilliant and creative species,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
but we've created a little too much stuff --

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
so much that our economy is now bigger

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
than its host, our planet.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
This is not a philosophical statement,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
this is just science

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
based in physics,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
chemistry and biology.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
There are many science-based analyses of this,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
but they all draw the same conclusion --

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
that we're living beyond our means.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
The eminent scientists of the Global Footprint Network, for example,

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
calculate that we need about 1.5 Earths

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
to sustain this economy.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
In other words,

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
to keep operating at our current level,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
we need 50 percent more Earth than we've got.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
In financial terms,

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.000
this would be like always spending 50 percent more than you earn,

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
going further into debt every year.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
But of course, you can't borrow natural resources,

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
so we're burning through our capital,

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
or stealing from the future.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
So when I say full, I mean really full --

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
well past any margin for error,

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
well past any dispute

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000
about methodology.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
What this means is our economy is unsustainable.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
I'm not saying it's not nice or pleasant

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
or that it's bad for polar bears or forests,

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
though it certainly is.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
What I'm saying

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
is our approach is simply unsustainable.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
In other words, thanks to those pesky laws of physics,

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
when things aren't sustainable, they stop.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
But that's not possible, you might think.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
We can't stop economic growth.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
Because that's what will stop: economic growth.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
It will stop because of the end of trade resources.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.000
It will stop because of the growing demand of us

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
on all the resources, all the capacity,

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
all the systems of the Earth,

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
which is now having economic damage.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
When we think about economic growth stopping,

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000
we go, "That's not possible,"

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000
because economic growth is so essential to our society

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000
that is is rarely questioned.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000
Although growth has certainly delivered many benefits,

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
it is an idea so essential

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
that we tend not to understand

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000
the possibility of it not being around.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
Even though it has delivered many benefits,

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
it is based on a crazy idea --

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
the crazy idea being

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
that we can have infinite growth

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
on a finite planet.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
And I'm here to tell you the emperor has no clothes.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
That the crazy idea is just that,

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
it is crazy,

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
and with the Earth full, it's game over.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
Come on, you're thinking.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
That's not possible.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000
Technology is amazing. People are innovative.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
There are so many ways we can improve the way we do things.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
We can surely sort this out.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000
That's all true.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
Well, it's mostly true.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
We are certainly amazing,

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
and we regularly solve complex problems

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
with amazing creativity.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000
So if our problem

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000
was to get the human economy down

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.000
from 150 percent to 100 percent of the Earth's capacity,

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
we could do that.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
The problem is we're just warming up

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000
this growth engine.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.000
We plan to take this highly-stressed economy

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.000
and make it twice as big

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000
and then make it four times as big --

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000
not in some distant future,

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000
but in less than 40 years,

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.000
in the life time of most of you.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.000
China plans to be there in just 20 years.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
The only problem with this plan

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.000
is that it's not possible.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000
In response, some people argue,

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000
but we need growth, we need it to solve poverty.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000
We need it to develop technology.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000
We need it to keep social stability.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000
I find this argument fascinating,

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.000
as though we can kind of bend the rules of physics

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000
to suit our needs.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.000
It's like the Earth doesn't care what we need.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000
Mother nature doesn't negotiate;

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000
she just sets rules and describes consequences.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000
And these are not esoteric limits.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000
This is about food and water, soil and climate,

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.000
the basic practical and economic foundations

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000
of our lives.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.000
So the idea that we can smoothly transition

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000
to a highly-efficient,

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000
solar-powered, knowledge-based economy

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000
transformed by science and technology

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000
so that nine billion people

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.000
can live in 2050

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000
a life of abundance and digital downloads

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000
is a delusion.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000
It's not that it's not possible to feed, clothe and house us all

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000
and have us live decent lives.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000
It certainly is.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000
But the idea that we can gently grow there

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000
with a few minor hiccups

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000
is just wrong,

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000
and it's dangerously wrong,

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000
because it means we're not getting ready

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000
for what's really going to happen.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.000
See what happens when you operate a system

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000
past its limits

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000
and then keep on going

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.000
at an ever-accelerating rate

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:31.000
is that the system stops working and breaks down.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.000
And that's what will happen to us.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000
Many of you will be thinking,

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000
but surely we can still stop this.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.000
If it's that bad, we'll react.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000
Let's just think through that idea.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.000
Now we've had

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000
50 years of warnings.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.000
We've had science proving

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000
the urgency of change.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000
We've had economic analysis pointing out

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000
that, not only can we afford it,

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000
it's cheaper to act early.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.000
And yet, the reality is

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.000
we've done pretty much nothing to change course.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.000
We're not even slowing down.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000
Last year on climate, for example,

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000
we had the highest global emissions ever.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.000
The story on food, on water, on soil, on climate

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.000
is all much the same.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000
I actually don't say this in despair.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000
I've done my grieving about the loss.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000
I accept where we are.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000
It is sad,

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000
but it is what it is.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000
But it is also time

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000
that we ended our denial

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000
and recognized

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.000
that we're not acting, we're not close to acting

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.000
and we're not going to act

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.000
until this crisis hits the economy.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.000
And that's why the end of growth

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000
is the central issue

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:51.000
and the event that we need to get ready for.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000
So when does this transition begin?

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000
When does this breakdown begin?

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.000
In my view, it is well underway.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000
I know most people don't see it that way.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000
We tend to look at the world,

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000
not as the integrated system that it is,

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.000
but as a series of individual issues.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.000
We see the Occupy protests,

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000
we see spiraling debt crises,

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.000
we see growing inequality,

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000
we see money's influence on politics,

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.000
we see resource constraint, food and oil prices.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.000
But we see, mistakenly, each of these issues

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:24.000
as individual problems to be solved.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.000
In fact, it's the system

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.000
in the painful process of breaking down --

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:32.000
our system, of debt-fueled economic growth,

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.000
of ineffective democracy,

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000
of overloading planet Earth,

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.000
is eating itself alive.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:42.000
I could give you countless studies

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:45.000
and evidence to prove this,

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.000
but I won't because, if you want to see it,

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:50.000
that evidence is all around you.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:53.000
I want to talk to you about fear.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:56.000
I want to do so because, in my view,

00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:01.000
the most important issue we face

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.000
is how we respond

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.000
to this question.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:08.000
The crisis is now inevitable.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:12.000
This issue is, how will we react?

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.000
Of course, we can't know what will happen.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.000
The future is inherently uncertain.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:20.000
But let's just think through what the science is telling us

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:23.000
is likely to happen.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:26.000
Imagine our economy

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000
when the carbon bubble bursts,

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.000
when the financial markets recognize

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000
that, to have any hope

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:35.000
of preventing the climate spiraling out of control,

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:39.000
the oil and coal industries are finished.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.000
Imagine China, India and Pakistan going to war

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.000
as climate impacts

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:48.000
generate conflict over food and water.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.000
Imagine the Middle East without oil income,

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.000
but with collapsing governments.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:57.000
Imagine our highly-tuned, just-in-time food industry

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:00.000
and our highly-stressed agricultural system failing

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:04.000
and supermarket shelves emptying.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:07.000
Imagine 30 percent unemployment in America

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.000
as the global economy is gripped

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.000
by fear and uncertainty.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.000
Now imagine what that means for you,

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:16.000
your family, your friends,

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.000
your personal financial security.

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.000
Imagine what it means

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.000
for your personal security

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.000
as a heavily armed civilian population

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.000
gets angrier and angrier

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:29.000
about why this was allowed to happen.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.000
Imagine what you'll tell your children

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.000
when they ask you,

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.000
"So, in 2012, Mom and Dad,

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.000
what was it like

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:41.000
when you'd had the hottest decade on record

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.000
for the third decade in a row,

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:46.000
when every scientific body in the world was saying

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:49.000
you've got a major problem,

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.000
when the oceans were acidifying,

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.000
when oil and food prices were spiking,

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:56.000
when they were rioting in the streets of London

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.000
and occupying Wall Street?

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:01.000
When the system was so clearly breaking down, Mom and Dad,

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:04.000
what did you do, what were you thinking?"

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:09.000
So how do you feel

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.000
when the lights go out

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:15.000
on the global economy in your mind,

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:18.000
when your assumptions about the future

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.000
fade away

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:23.000
and something very different emerges?

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.000
Just take a moment

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.000
and take a breath

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:30.000
and think, what do you feel

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.000
at this point?

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:39.000
Perhaps denial.

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:42.000
Perhaps anger.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:45.000
Maybe fear.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:50.000
Of course, we can't know what's going to happen

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:53.000
and we have to live with uncertainty.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:57.000
But when we think about the kind of possibilities I paint,

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:01.000
we should feel a bit of fear.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:04.000
We are in danger, all of us,

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:07.000
and we've evolved to respond to danger with fear

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:11.000
to motivate a powerful response,

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:14.000
to help us bravely face a threat.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:17.000
But this time it's not a tiger at the cave mouth.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:20.000
You can't see the danger at your door.

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.000
But if you look,

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:26.000
you can see it at the door of your civilization.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:29.000
That's why we need to feel our response now while the lights are still on,

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:32.000
because if we wait until the crisis takes hold,

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.000
we may panic and hide.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.000
If we feel it now and think it through,

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.000
we will realize we have nothing to fear

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:41.000
but fear itself.

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:46.000
Yes, things will get ugly, and it will happen soon --

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.000
certainly in our lifetime --

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.000
but we are more than capable

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:53.000
of getting through everything that's coming.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:56.000
You see, those people that have faith

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:59.000
that humans can solve any problem,

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:02.000
that technology is limitless, that markets can be a force for good,

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.000
are in fact right.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.000
The only thing they're missing

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:09.000
is that it takes a good crisis to get us going.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:12.000
When we feel fear and we fear loss

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:15.000
we are capable of quite extraordinary things.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:18.000
Think about war.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:21.000
After the bombing of Pearl Harbor, it just took four days

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:23.000
for the government to ban the production of civilian cars

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:25.000
and to redirect the auto industry,

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:29.000
and from there to rationing of food and energy.

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:32.000
Think about how a company responds to a bankruptcy threat

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:35.000
and how a change that seemed impossible just gets done.

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:37.000
Think about how an individual responds

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:40.000
to a diagnosis of a life-threatening illness

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:42.000
and how lifestyle changes

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:45.000
that previously were just too difficult

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:49.000
suddenly become relatively easy.

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:52.000
We are smart, in fact, we really are quite amazing,

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.000
but we do love a good crisis.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.000
And the good news, this one's a monster.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.000
(Laughter)

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.000
Sure, if we get it wrong,

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.000
we could face the end of this civilization,

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:04.000
but if we get it right,

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:07.000
it could be the beginning of civilization instead.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:09.000
And how cool would it be

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:12.000
to tell your grandchildren that you were part of that?

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:19.000
There's certainly no technical or economic barrier in the way.

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:21.000
Scientists like James Hansen tell us

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:24.000
we may need to eliminate net CO2 emissions from the economy

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.000
in just a few decades.

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:28.000
I wanted to know what that would take,

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:31.000
so I worked with professor Jorgen Randers from Norway

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.000
to find the answer.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:37.000
We developed a plan called "The One Degree War Plan" --

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:41.000
so named because of the level of mobilization and focus required.

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:43.000
To my surprise,

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:46.000
eliminating net CO2 emissions from the economy in just 20 years

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:49.000
is actually pretty easy and pretty cheap,

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:51.000
not very cheap,

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:54.000
but certainly less than the cost of a collapsing civilization.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.000
We didn't calculate that precisely,

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:59.000
but we understand that's very expensive.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:01.000
You can read the details,

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:03.000
but in summary, we can transform our economy.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:05.000
We can do it with proven technology.

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:07.000
We can do it at an affordable cost.

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:09.000
We can do it with existing political structures.

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:11.000
The only thing we need to change

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:14.000
is how we think and how we feel.

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:17.000
And this is where you come in.

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:19.000
When we think about the future I paint,

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:21.000
of course we should feel a bit of fear.

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:24.000
But fear can be paralyzing or motivating.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:27.000
We need to accept the fear and then we need to act.

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:29.000
We need to act

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:31.000
like the future depends on it.

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:34.000
We need to act like we only have one planet.

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:37.000
We can do this.

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:40.000
I know the free market fundamentalists will tell you

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:43.000
that more growth, more stuff and nine billion people going shopping

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:45.000
is the best we can do.

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:47.000
They're wrong.

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:49.000
We can be more,

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:51.000
we can be much more.

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:54.000
We have achieved remarkable things

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:56.000
since working out how to grow food some 10,000 years ago.

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:59.000
We've built a powerful foundation

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:01.000
of science, knowledge and technology --

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.000
more than enough to build a society

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:05.000
where nine billion people

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:07.000
can lead decent, meaningful and satisfying lives.

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:09.000
The Earth can support that

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:13.000
if we choose the right path.

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:15.000
We can choose this moment of crisis

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:18.000
to ask and answer the big questions of society's evolution --

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:21.000
like, what do we want to be when we grow up,

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:24.000
when we move past this bumbling adolescence

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:26.000
where we think there are no limits

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:29.000
and suffer delusions of immortality?

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:31.000
Well it's time to grow up,

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:33.000
to be wiser, to be calmer,

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:35.000
to be more considered.

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:37.000
Like generations before us,

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:39.000
we'll be growing up in war --

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:41.000
not a war between civilizations,

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:43.000
but a war for civilization,

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:45.000
for the extraordinary opportunity

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:47.000
to build a society

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:49.000
which is stronger and happier

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:51.000
and plans on staying around

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:54.000
into middle age.

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:56.000
We can choose life over fear.

00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:00.000
We can do what we need to do,

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:02.000
but it will take every entrepreneur,

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:04.000
every artist,

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:06.000
every scientist, every communicator,

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:09.000
every mother, every father, every child,

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:12.000
every one of us.

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:15.000
This could be our finest hour.

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:17.000
Thank you.

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:25.000
(Applause)
