00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
(Applause)

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
(Video) Announcer: Threats, in the wake of Bin Laden's death, have spiked.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Announcer Two: Famine in Somalia. Announcer Three: Police pepper spray.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Announcer Four: Vicious cartels. Announcer Five: Caustic cruise lines.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Announcer Six: Societal decay. Announcer Seven: 65 dead.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Announcer Eight: Tsunami warning. Announcer Nine: Cyberattacks.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Multiple Announcers: Drug war. Mass destruction. Tornado.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Recession. Default. Doomsday. Egypt. Syria.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Crisis. Death. Disaster.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Oh, my God.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Peter Diamandis: So those are just a few of the clips

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
I collected over the last six months --

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
could have easily been the last six days

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
or the last six years.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
The point is that the news media

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
preferentially feeds us negative stories

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
because that's what our minds pay attention to.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
And there's a very good reason for that.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
Every second of every day,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
our senses bring in way too much data

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
than we can possibly process in our brains.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
And because nothing is more important to us

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
than survival,

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
the first stop of all of that data

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
is an ancient sliver of the temporal lobe

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
called the amygdala.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
Now the amygdala is our early warning detector,

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
our danger detector.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
It sorts and scours through all of the information

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
looking for anything in the environment that might harm us.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
So given a dozen news stories,

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
we will preferentially look

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
at the negative news.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
And that old newspaper saying,

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
"If it bleeds it leads,"

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
is very true.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
So given all of our digital devices

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
that are bringing all the negative news to us

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
seven days a week, 24 hours a day,

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
it's no wonder that we're pessimistic.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
It's no wonder that people think

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.000
that the world is getting worse.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
But perhaps that's not the case.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
Perhaps instead,

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
it's the distortions brought to us

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
of what's really going on.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
Perhaps the tremendous progress we've made

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
over the last century

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
by a series of forces

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
are, in fact, accelerating to a point

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
that we have the potential in the next three decades

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
to create a world of abundance.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
Now I'm not saying

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
we don't have our set of problems --

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
climate crisis, species extinction,

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
water and energy shortage -- we surely do.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
And as humans, we are far better

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000
at seeing the problems way in advance,

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.000
but ultimately we knock them down.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
So let's look

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
at what this last century has been

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
to see where we're going.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
Over the last hundred years,

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
the average human lifespan has more than doubled,

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000
average per capita income adjusted for inflation

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
around the world has tripled.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
Childhood mortality

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
has come down a factor of 10.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
Add to that the cost of food, electricity,

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
transportation, communication

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.000
have dropped 10 to 1,000-fold.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
Steve Pinker has showed us

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
that, in fact, we're living during the most peaceful time ever

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
in human history.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
And Charles Kenny

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000
that global literacy has gone from 25 percent to over 80 percent

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000
in the last 130 years.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.000
We truly are living in an extraordinary time.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
And many people forget this.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000
And we keep setting our expectations higher and higher.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000
In fact, we redefine what poverty means.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000
Think of this, in America today,

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000
the majority of people under the poverty line

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000
still have electricity, water, toilets, refrigerators,

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
television, mobile phones,

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.000
air conditioning and cars.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.000
The wealthiest robber barons of the last century, the emperors on this planet,

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000
could have never dreamed of such luxuries.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.000
Underpinning much of this

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000
is technology,

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000
and of late,

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000
exponentially growing technologies.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000
My good friend Ray Kurzweil

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.000
showed that any tool that becomes an information technology

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.000
jumps on this curve, on Moore's Law,

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000
and experiences price performance doubling

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
every 12 to 24 months.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
That's why the cellphone in your pocket

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000
is literally a million times cheaper and a thousand times faster

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000
than a supercomputer of the '70s.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000
Now look at this curve.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000
This is Moore's Law over the last hundred years.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000
I want you to notice two things from this curve.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.000
Number one, how smooth it is --

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.000
through good time and bad time, war time and peace time,

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.000
recession, depression and boom time.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000
This is the result of faster computers

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000
being used to build faster computers.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:31.000
It doesn't slow for any of our grand challenges.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000
And also, even though it's plotted

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000
on a log curve on the left,

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000
it's curving upwards.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000
The rate at which the technology is getting faster

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.000
is itself getting faster.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.000
And on this curve, riding on Moore's Law,

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000
are a set of extraordinarily powerful technologies

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000
available to all of us.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
Cloud computing,

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000
what my friends at Autodesk call infinite computing;

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000
sensors and networks; robotics;

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000
3D printing, which is the ability to democratize and distribute

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000
personalized production around the planet;

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000
synthetic biology;

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.000
fuels, vaccines and foods;

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.000
digital medicine; nanomaterials; and A.I.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.000
I mean, how many of you saw the winning of Jeopardy

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000
by IBM's Watson?

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000
I mean, that was epic.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000
In fact, I scoured the headlines

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000
looking for the best headline in a newspaper I could.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:26.000
And I love this: "Watson Vanquishes Human Opponents."

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000
Jeopardy's not an easy game.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.000
It's about the nuance of human language.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.000
And imagine if you would

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000
A.I.'s like this on the cloud

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.000
available to every person with a cellphone.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000
Four years ago here at TED,

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000
Ray Kurzweil and I started a new university

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000
called Singularity University.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.000
And we teach our students all of these technologies,

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000
and particularly how they can be used

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.000
to solve humanity's grand challenges.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.000
And every year we ask them

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.000
to start a company or a product or a service

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.000
that can affect positively the lives of a billion people

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.000
within a decade.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.000
Think about that, the fact that, literally, a group of students

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.000
can touch the lives of a billion people today.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.000
30 years ago that would have sounded ludicrous.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.000
Today we can point at dozens of companies

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.000
that have done just that.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:22.000
When I think about creating abundance,

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.000
it's not about creating a life of luxury for everybody on this planet;

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:28.000
it's about creating a life of possibility.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.000
It is about taking that which was scarce

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.000
and making it abundant.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.000
You see, scarcity is contextual,

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:41.000
and technology is a resource-liberating force.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.000
Let me give you an example.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.000
So this is a story of Napoleon III

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.000
in the mid-1800s.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.000
He's the dude on the left.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000
He invited over to dinner

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000
the king of Siam.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.000
All of Napoleon's troops

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.000
were fed with silver utensils,

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000
Napoleon himself with gold utensils.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000
But the King of Siam,

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.000
he was fed with aluminum utensils.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.000
You see, aluminum

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:11.000
was the most valuable metal on the planet,

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.000
worth more than gold and platinum.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.000
It's the reason that the tip of the Washington Monument

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.000
is made of aluminum.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.000
You see, even though aluminum

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.000
is 8.3 percent of the Earth by mass,

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.000
it doesn't come as a pure metal.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.000
It's all bound by oxygen and silicates.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:32.000
But then the technology of electrolysis came along

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.000
and literally made aluminum so cheap

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.000
that we use it with throw-away mentality.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:42.000
So let's project this analogy going forward.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.000
We think about energy scarcity.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.000
Ladies and gentlemen,

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.000
we are on a planet

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:51.000
that is bathed with 5,000 times more energy

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:54.000
than we use in a year.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.000
16 terawatts of energy hits the Earth's surface

00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:00.000
every 88 minutes.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000
It's not about being scarce,

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000
it's about accessibility.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.000
And there's good news here.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.000
For the first time, this year

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:11.000
the cost of solar-generated electricity

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:15.000
is 50 percent that of diesel-generated electricity in India --

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.000
8.8 rupees versus 17 rupees.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.000
The cost of solar dropped 50 percent last year.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.000
Last month, MIT put out a study

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.000
showing that by the end of this decade,

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000
in the sunny parts of the United States,

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000
solar electricity will be six cents a kilowatt hour

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.000
compared to 15 cents

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000
as a national average.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:35.000
And if we have abundant energy,

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:38.000
we also have abundant water.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:43.000
Now we talk about water wars.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.000
Do you remember

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.000
when Carl Sagan turned the Voyager spacecraft

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.000
back towards the Earth,

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000
in 1990 after it just passed Saturn?

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:54.000
He took a famous photo. What was it called?

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.000
"A Pale Blue Dot."

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:59.000
Because we live on a water planet.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:02.000
We live on a planet 70 percent covered by water.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000
Yes, 97.5 percent is saltwater,

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.000
two percent is ice,

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:09.000
and we fight over a half a percent of the water on this planet,

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.000
but here too there is hope.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:14.000
And there is technology coming online,

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.000
not 10, 20 years from now,

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.000
right now.

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:21.000
There's nanotechnology coming on, nanomaterials.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:24.000
And the conversation I had with Dean Kamen this morning,

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.000
one of the great DIY innovators,

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:29.000
I'd like to share with you -- he gave me permission to do so --

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.000
his technology called Slingshot

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.000
that many of you may have heard of,

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.000
it is the size of a small dorm room refrigerator.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.000
It's able to generate

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.000
a thousand liters of clean drinking water a day

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:42.000
out of any source -- saltwater, polluted water, latrine --

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.000
at less than two cents a liter.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.000
The chairman of Coca-Cola has just agreed

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.000
to do a major test

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:54.000
of hundreds of units of this in the developing world.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.000
And if that pans out,

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.000
which I have every confidence it will,

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.000
Coca-Cola will deploy this globally

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.000
to 206 countries

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.000
around the planet.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:07.000
This is the kind of innovation, empowered by this technology,

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:11.000
that exists today.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.000
And we've seen this in cellphones.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.000
My goodness, we're going to hit 70 percent penetration

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:17.000
of cellphones in the developing world

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.000
by the end of 2013.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.000
Think about it,

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:24.000
that a Masai warrior on a cellphone in the middle of Kenya

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.000
has better mobile comm

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:29.000
than President Reagan did 25 years ago.

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.000
And if they're on a smartphone on Google,

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:33.000
they've got access to more knowledge and information

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.000
than President Clinton did 15 years ago.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:38.000
They're living in a world of information and communication abundance

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:41.000
that no one could have ever predicted.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.000
Better than that,

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.000
the things that you and I

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.000
spent tens and hundreds of thousands of dollars for --

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:51.000
GPS, HD video and still images,

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:54.000
libraries of books and music,

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.000
medical diagnostic technology --

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:59.000
are now literally dematerializing and demonetizing

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:02.000
into your cellphone.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:06.000
Probably the best part of it

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:09.000
is what's coming down the pike in health.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:13.000
Last month, I had the pleasure of announcing with Qualcomm Foundation

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:17.000
something called the $10 million Qualcomm Tricorder X Prize.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.000
We're challenging teams around the world

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.000
to basically combine these technologies

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.000
into a mobile device

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.000
that you can speak to, because it's got A.I.,

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:28.000
you can cough on it, you can do a finger blood prick.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.000
And to win, it needs to be able to diagnose you better

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:34.000
than a team of board-certified doctors.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:37.000
So literally, imagine this device

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:40.000
in the middle of the developing world where there are no doctors,

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:42.000
25 percent of the disease burden

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:45.000
and 1.3 percent of the health care workers.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:47.000
When this device sequences an RNA or DNA virus

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.000
that it doesn't recognize,

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.000
it calls the CDC

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:54.000
and prevents the pandemic from happening in the first place.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:59.000
But here, here is the biggest force

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.000
for bringing about a world of abundance.

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:04.000
I call it the rising billion.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:07.000
So the white lines here are population.

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:10.000
We just passed the seven billion mark on Earth.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.000
And by the way,

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.000
the biggest protection against a population explosion

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.000
is making the world educated

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:19.000
and healthy.

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:21.000
In 2010,

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:23.000
we had just short of two billion people

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:25.000
online, connected.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.000
By 2020,

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:29.000
that's going from two billion to five billion

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:31.000
Internet users.

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:33.000
Three billion new minds

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:35.000
who have never been heard from before

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:39.000
are connecting to the global conversation.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:41.000
What will these people want?

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.000
What will they consume? What will they desire?

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:45.000
And rather than having economic shutdown,

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:48.000
we're about to have the biggest economic injection ever.

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.000
These people represent

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:52.000
tens of trillions of dollars

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:55.000
injected into the global economy.

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.000
And they will get healthier

00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:59.000
by using the Tricorder,

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.000
and they'll become better educated by using the Khan Academy,

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:04.000
and by literally being able to use

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:07.000
3D printing and infinite computing

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:10.000
[become] more productive than ever before.

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:13.000
So what could three billion rising,

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:16.000
healthy, educated, productive members of humanity

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.000
bring to us?

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:21.000
How about a set of voices that have never been heard from before.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.000
What about giving the oppressed,

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:25.000
wherever they might be,

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:27.000
the voice to be heard and the voice to act

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:30.000
for the first time ever?

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:33.000
What will these three billion people bring?

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:36.000
What about contributions we can't even predict?

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.000
The one thing I've learned at the X Prize

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.000
is that small teams

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:43.000
driven by their passion with a clear focus

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:45.000
can do extraordinary things,

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.000
things that large corporations and governments

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:50.000
could only do in the past.

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.000
Let me share and close with a story

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:55.000
that really got me excited.

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.000
There is a program that some of you might have heard of.

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:59.000
It's a game called Foldit.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:03.000
It came out of the University of Washington in Seattle.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:05.000
And this is a game

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:09.000
where individuals can actually take a sequence of amino acids

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:13.000
and figure out how the protein is going to fold.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:15.000
And how it folds dictates its structure and its functionality.

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:18.000
And it's very important for research in medicine.

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:21.000
And up until now, it's been a supercomputer problem.

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:23.000
And this game has been played

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:25.000
by university professors and so forth.

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:28.000
And it's literally, hundreds of thousands of people

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.000
came online and started playing it.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.000
And it showed that, in fact, today,

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.000
the human pattern recognition machinery

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:37.000
is better at folding proteins than the best computers.

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.000
And when these individuals went and looked

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:42.000
at who was the best protein folder in the world,

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:44.000
it wasn't an MIT professor,

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.000
it wasn't a CalTech student,

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:49.000
it was a person from England, from Manchester,

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:53.000
a woman who, during the day,

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:56.000
was an executive assistant at a rehab clinic

00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:00.000
and, at night, was the world's best protein folder.

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.000
Ladies and gentlemen,

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:05.000
what gives me tremendous confidence

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:09.000
in the future

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:13.000
is the fact that we are now more empowered as individuals

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:16.000
to take on the grand challenges of this planet.

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:19.000
We have the tools with this exponential technology.

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:22.000
We have the passion of the DIY innovator.

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:25.000
We have the capital of the techno-philanthropist.

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:27.000
And we have three billion new minds

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:29.000
coming online to work with us

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:31.000
to solve the grand challenges,

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:35.000
to do that which we must do.

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:37.000
We are living into extraordinary decades ahead.

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:39.000
Thank you.

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:53.000
(Applause)
