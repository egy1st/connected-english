00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.976
When I was nine years old,

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.143
I went off to summer camp
for the first time.

00:00:04.167 --> 00:00:07.976
And my mother packed me a suitcase
full of books,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.667
which to me seemed like
a perfectly natural thing to do.

00:00:10.691 --> 00:00:14.976
Because in my family,
reading was the primary group activity.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.976
And this might sound antisocial to you,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.976
but for us it was really just
a different way of being social.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.976
You have the animal warmth of your family
sitting right next to you,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.858
but you are also free to go
roaming around the adventureland

00:00:26.882 --> 00:00:27.976
inside your own mind.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:29.976
And I had this idea

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.524
that camp was going to be
just like this, but better.

00:00:32.548 --> 00:00:34.976
(Laughter)

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.976
I had a vision of 10 girls
sitting in a cabin

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.381
cozily reading books
in their matching nightgowns.

00:00:40.405 --> 00:00:41.976
(Laughter)

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.976
Camp was more like a keg party
without any alcohol.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.976
And on the very first day,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.976
our counselor gathered us all together

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.676
and she taught us a cheer
that she said we would be doing

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:55.976
every day for the rest of the summer
to instill camp spirit.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:57.976
And it went like this:

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.976
"R-O-W-D-I-E,

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.976
that's the way we spell rowdie.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.393
Rowdie, rowdie, let's get rowdie."

00:01:05.417 --> 00:01:06.417
(Laughter)

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.976
Yeah.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.048
So I couldn't figure out
for the life of me

00:01:11.072 --> 00:01:12.976
why we were supposed to be so rowdy,

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.976
or why we had to spell
this word incorrectly.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.976
(Laughter)

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.191
But I recited a cheer. I recited
a cheer along with everybody else.

00:01:25.215 --> 00:01:26.976
I did my best.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.079
And I just waited for the time
that I could go off and read my books.

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:35.360
But the first time that I took
my book out of my suitcase,

00:01:35.384 --> 00:01:37.400
the coolest girl in the bunk came up to me

00:01:37.424 --> 00:01:39.876
and she asked me, "Why
are you being so mellow?" --

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.948
mellow, of course,
being the exact opposite

00:01:41.972 --> 00:01:43.176
of R-O-W-D-I-E.

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:45.776
And then the second time I tried it,

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:48.976
the counselor came up to me
with a concerned expression on her face

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.096
and she repeated the point
about camp spirit

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:54.330
and said we should all work very hard
to be outgoing.

00:01:54.354 --> 00:01:56.976
And so I put my books away,

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.976
back in their suitcase,

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.976
and I put them under my bed,

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.376
and there they stayed
for the rest of the summer.

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:08.176
And I felt kind of guilty about this.

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:10.176
I felt as if the books needed me somehow,

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.976
and they were calling out to me
and I was forsaking them.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.876
But I did forsake them
and I didn't open that suitcase again

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.976
until I was back home with my family
at the end of the summer.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.976
Now, I tell you this story
about summer camp.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.976
I could have told you
50 others just like it --

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.976
all the times that I got the message

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.976
that somehow my quiet
and introverted style of being

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.976
was not necessarily the right way to go,

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.976
that I should be trying to pass
as more of an extrovert.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.976
And I always sensed deep down
that this was wrong

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.858
and that introverts were
pretty excellent just as they were.

00:02:41.882 --> 00:02:43.976
But for years I denied this intuition,

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.976
and so I became a Wall Street
lawyer, of all things,

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.976
instead of the writer
that I had always longed to be --

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.976
partly because I needed to prove to myself
that I could be bold and assertive too.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.077
And I was always going off to crowded bars

00:02:56.101 --> 00:02:59.673
when I really would have preferred
to just have a nice dinner with friends.

00:02:59.697 --> 00:03:03.976
And I made these
self-negating choices so reflexively,

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.703
that I wasn't even aware
that I was making them.

00:03:07.497 --> 00:03:09.276
Now this is what many introverts do,

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:10.976
and it's our loss for sure,

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.976
but it is also our colleagues' loss

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.976
and our communities' loss.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.976
And at the risk of sounding grandiose,
it is the world's loss.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.976
Because when it comes
to creativity and to leadership,

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.976
we need introverts doing
what they do best.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.524
A third to a half of the population
are introverts --

00:03:26.548 --> 00:03:27.976
a third to a half.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.976
So that's one out of every two
or three people you know.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.976
So even if you're an extrovert yourself,

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:35.976
I'm talking about your coworkers

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.976
and your spouses and your children

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.976
and the person sitting
next to you right now --

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:42.976
all of them subject to this bias

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.096
that is pretty deep
and real in our society.

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:47.976
We all internalize it
from a very early age

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.976
without even having a language
for what we're doing.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.976
Now, to see the bias clearly,

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.976
you need to understand
what introversion is.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:57.976
It's different from being shy.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.976
Shyness is about fear of social judgment.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.976
Introversion is more about,

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:03.976
how do you respond to stimulation,

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:05.976
including social stimulation.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.976
So extroverts really crave
large amounts of stimulation,

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.077
whereas introverts feel
at their most alive

00:04:11.101 --> 00:04:13.477
and their most switched-on
and their most capable

00:04:13.501 --> 00:04:15.906
when they're in quieter,
more low-key environments.

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:18.359
Not all the time --
these things aren't absolute --

00:04:18.383 --> 00:04:19.576
but a lot of the time.

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:23.976
So the key then to maximizing our talents

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.976
is for us all to put ourselves

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.976
in the zone of stimulation
that is right for us.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:30.976
But now here's where the bias comes in.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:32.976
Our most important institutions,

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:34.976
our schools and our workplaces,

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:36.976
they are designed mostly for extroverts

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.976
and for extroverts' need
for lots of stimulation.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.976
And also we have
this belief system right now

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:45.976
that I call the new groupthink,

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.976
which holds that all creativity
and all productivity

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:53.000
comes from a very oddly gregarious place.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.334
So if you picture the typical
classroom nowadays:

00:04:56.358 --> 00:04:59.976
When I was going to school,
we sat in rows.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:01.976
We sat in rows of desks like this,

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.263
and we did most of our work
pretty autonomously.

00:05:04.287 --> 00:05:07.976
But nowadays, your typical classroom
has pods of desks --

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.976
four or five or six or seven kids
all facing each other.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.477
And kids are working
in countless group assignments.

00:05:13.501 --> 00:05:15.976
Even in subjects like math
and creative writing,

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.976
which you think would depend
on solo flights of thought,

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.976
kids are now expected to act
as committee members.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:27.191
And for the kids who prefer to go off
by themselves or just to work alone,

00:05:27.215 --> 00:05:29.076
those kids are seen as outliers often

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:31.000
or, worse, as problem cases.

00:05:33.746 --> 00:05:35.622
And the vast majority of teachers

00:05:35.646 --> 00:05:38.376
reports believing that
the ideal student is an extrovert

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:39.976
as opposed to an introvert,

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.334
even though introverts
actually get better grades

00:05:42.358 --> 00:05:43.976
and are more knowledgeable,

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:45.976
according to research.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:47.976
(Laughter)

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.976
Okay, same thing is true
in our workplaces.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.976
Now, most of us work in open plan offices,

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:55.976
without walls,

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:00.286
where we are subject to the constant
noise and gaze of our coworkers.

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:01.976
And when it comes to leadership,

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.976
introverts are routinely passed over
for leadership positions,

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.216
even though introverts
tend to be very careful,

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:09.216
much less likely to take outsize risks --

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:11.976
which is something
we might all favor nowadays.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.976
And interesting research
by Adam Grant at the Wharton School

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:16.976
has found that introverted leaders

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.334
often deliver better outcomes
than extroverts do,

00:06:19.358 --> 00:06:21.976
because when they are managing
proactive employees,

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.263
they're much more likely to let
those employees run with their ideas,

00:06:25.287 --> 00:06:27.383
whereas an extrovert
can, quite unwittingly,

00:06:27.407 --> 00:06:28.976
get so excited about things

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.216
that they're putting
their own stamp on things,

00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:35.976
and other people's ideas might not
as easily then bubble up to the surface.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.776
Now in fact, some of our transformative
leaders in history have been introverts.

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:41.176
I'll give you some examples.

00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:43.976
Eleanor Roosevelt, Rosa Parks, Gandhi --

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:48.976
all these people described themselves
as quiet and soft-spoken and even shy.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:50.976
And they all took the spotlight,

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:55.000
even though every bone in their bodies
was telling them not to.

00:06:56.269 --> 00:06:58.876
And this turns out to have
a special power all its own,

00:06:58.900 --> 00:07:01.876
because people could feel
that these leaders were at the helm

00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:03.876
not because they enjoyed directing others

00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:06.176
and not out of the pleasure
of being looked at;

00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:08.248
they were there
because they had no choice,

00:07:08.272 --> 00:07:11.444
because they were driven to do
what they thought was right.

00:07:11.468 --> 00:07:14.076
Now I think at this point
it's important for me to say

00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:16.976
that I actually love extroverts.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.976
I always like to say some of my best
friends are extroverts,

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.000
including my beloved husband.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.239
And we all fall
at different points, of course,

00:07:26.263 --> 00:07:28.976
along the introvert/extrovert spectrum.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:32.406
Even Carl Jung, the psychologist
who first popularized these terms,

00:07:32.430 --> 00:07:34.821
said that there's no such thing
as a pure introvert

00:07:34.845 --> 00:07:36.176
or a pure extrovert.

00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:38.724
He said that such a man
would be in a lunatic asylum,

00:07:38.748 --> 00:07:40.976
if he existed at all.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:44.976
And some people fall smack in the middle
of the introvert/extrovert spectrum,

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:46.976
and we call these people ambiverts.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:50.000
And I often think that they have
the best of all worlds.

00:07:50.999 --> 00:07:53.976
But many of us do recognize
ourselves as one type or the other.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.286
And what I'm saying is that culturally,
we need a much better balance.

00:07:57.310 --> 00:08:00.976
We need more of a yin and yang
between these two types.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:02.976
This is especially important

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.286
when it comes to creativity
and to productivity,

00:08:05.310 --> 00:08:08.976
because when psychologists look
at the lives of the most creative people,

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:10.976
what they find

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.286
are people who are very good
at exchanging ideas

00:08:13.310 --> 00:08:14.976
and advancing ideas,

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.976
but who also have a serious
streak of introversion in them.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.229
And this is because solitude

00:08:20.253 --> 00:08:22.376
is a crucial ingredient
often to creativity.

00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:23.976
So Darwin,

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:25.976
he took long walks alone in the woods

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.976
and emphatically turned down
dinner-party invitations.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.976
Theodor Geisel, better known as Dr. Seuss,

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.025
he dreamed up many
of his amazing creations

00:08:34.049 --> 00:08:36.025
in a lonely bell tower office that he had

00:08:36.049 --> 00:08:38.976
in the back of his house
in La Jolla, California.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.976
And he was actually afraid to meet
the young children who read his books

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:47.000
for fear that they were expecting him
this kind of jolly Santa Claus-like figure

00:08:47.024 --> 00:08:50.976
and would be disappointed
with his more reserved persona.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.239
Steve Wozniak invented
the first Apple computer

00:08:53.263 --> 00:08:56.260
sitting alone in his cubicle
in Hewlett-Packard

00:08:56.284 --> 00:08:57.921
where he was working at the time.

00:08:57.945 --> 00:09:01.620
And he says that he never would have
become such an expert in the first place

00:09:01.644 --> 00:09:04.076
had he not been too introverted
to leave the house

00:09:04.100 --> 00:09:05.376
when he was growing up.

00:09:05.808 --> 00:09:07.976
Now, of course,

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.976
this does not mean that we should
all stop collaborating --

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:14.620
and case in point, is Steve Wozniak
famously coming together with Steve Jobs

00:09:14.644 --> 00:09:16.976
to start Apple Computer --

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.976
but it does mean that solitude matters

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:23.976
and that for some people
it is the air that they breathe.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:29.976
And in fact, we have known for centuries
about the transcendent power of solitude.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.976
It's only recently that
we've strangely begun to forget it.

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.976
If you look at most
of the world's major religions,

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:37.976
you will find seekers --

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.976
Moses, Jesus, Buddha, Muhammad --

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:44.976
seekers who are going off by themselves
alone to the wilderness,

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.676
where they then have profound
epiphanies and revelations

00:09:47.700 --> 00:09:50.376
that they then bring back
to the rest of the community.

00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:53.976
So, no wilderness, no revelations.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:55.976
This is no surprise, though,

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.976
if you look at the insights
of contemporary psychology.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.976
It turns out that we can't
even be in a group of people

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.976
without instinctively mirroring,
mimicking their opinions.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.334
Even about seemingly
personal and visceral things

00:10:07.358 --> 00:10:08.976
like who you're attracted to,

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.976
you will start aping the beliefs
of the people around you

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.524
without even realizing
that that's what you're doing.

00:10:14.548 --> 00:10:16.976
And groups famously follow the opinions

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.676
of the most dominant
or charismatic person in the room,

00:10:19.700 --> 00:10:21.476
even though there's zero correlation

00:10:21.500 --> 00:10:24.276
between being the best talker
and having the best ideas --

00:10:24.300 --> 00:10:25.976
I mean zero.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:27.976
So --

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:29.976
(Laughter)

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.976
You might be following the person
with the best ideas,

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:34.976
but you might not.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.976
And do you really want
to leave it up to chance?

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.381
Much better for everybody
to go off by themselves,

00:10:40.405 --> 00:10:41.976
generate their own ideas

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.143
freed from the distortions
of group dynamics,

00:10:44.167 --> 00:10:45.976
and then come together as a team

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.976
to talk them through
in a well-managed environment

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:50.976
and take it from there.

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:52.976
Now if all this is true,

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.976
then why are we getting it so wrong?

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.976
Why are we setting up our schools
this way, and our workplaces?

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.524
And why are we making
these introverts feel so guilty

00:11:01.548 --> 00:11:04.476
about wanting to just go off
by themselves some of the time?

00:11:04.500 --> 00:11:06.976
One answer lies deep
in our cultural history.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:08.976
Western societies,

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:10.976
and in particular the U.S.,

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:17.105
have always favored the man of action
over the "man" of contemplation.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.976
But in America's early days,

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.976
we lived in what historians
call a culture of character,

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.096
where we still,
at that point, valued people

00:11:27.120 --> 00:11:29.976
for their inner selves
and their moral rectitude.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.576
And if you look at the self-help
books from this era,

00:11:32.600 --> 00:11:34.376
they all had titles with things like

00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:36.976
"Character, the Grandest
Thing in the World."

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.976
And they featured role models
like Abraham Lincoln,

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:42.286
who was praised for being
modest and unassuming.

00:11:42.310 --> 00:11:43.976
Ralph Waldo Emerson called him

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:46.976
"A man who does not
offend by superiority."

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.976
But then we hit the 20th century,

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:51.976
and we entered a new culture

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.263
that historians call
the culture of personality.

00:11:54.287 --> 00:11:56.963
What happened is we had evolved
an agricultural economy

00:11:56.987 --> 00:11:58.376
to a world of big business.

00:11:58.400 --> 00:12:01.976
And so suddenly people are moving
from small towns to the cities.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:05.311
And instead of working alongside people
they've known all their lives,

00:12:05.335 --> 00:12:08.976
now they are having to prove themselves
in a crowd of strangers.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:10.976
So, quite understandably,

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:14.976
qualities like magnetism and charisma
suddenly come to seem really important.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:18.191
And sure enough, the self-help books
change to meet these new needs

00:12:18.215 --> 00:12:19.976
and they start to have names

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.216
like "How to Win Friends
and Influence People."

00:12:22.240 --> 00:12:26.976
And they feature as their role models
really great salesmen.

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:29.000
So that's the world we're living in today.

00:12:29.024 --> 00:12:32.976
That's our cultural inheritance.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:37.976
Now none of this is to say
that social skills are unimportant,

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:42.976
and I'm also not calling
for the abolishing of teamwork at all.

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:46.191
The same religions who send their sages
off to lonely mountain tops

00:12:46.215 --> 00:12:48.976
also teach us love and trust.

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:50.976
And the problems that we are facing today

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:52.976
in fields like science and in economics

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:54.976
are so vast and so complex

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.776
that we are going to need armies
of people coming together

00:12:57.800 --> 00:12:59.376
to solve them working together.

00:12:59.400 --> 00:13:03.176
But I am saying that the more freedom
that we give introverts to be themselves,

00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:04.676
the more likely that they are

00:13:04.700 --> 00:13:07.700
to come up with their own unique
solutions to these problems.

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:14.000
So now I'd like to share with you
what's in my suitcase today.

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:19.976
Guess what?

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:21.976
Books.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:23.976
I have a suitcase full of books.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:25.976
Here's Margaret Atwood, "Cat's Eye."

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:28.976
Here's a novel by Milan Kundera.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:33.976
And here's "The Guide for the Perplexed"
by Maimonides.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:36.976
But these are not exactly my books.

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:38.976
I brought these books with me

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:42.976
because they were written
by my grandfather's favorite authors.

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:44.976
My grandfather was a rabbi

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:46.976
and he was a widower

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:49.976
who lived alone in a small
apartment in Brooklyn

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.976
that was my favorite place
in the world when I was growing up,

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:56.429
partly because it was filled with
his very gentle, very courtly presence

00:13:56.453 --> 00:13:58.976
and partly because
it was filled with books.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:01.976
I mean literally every table,
every chair in this apartment

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:03.976
had yielded its original function

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:06.976
to now serve as a surface
for swaying stacks of books.

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:08.976
Just like the rest of my family,

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:12.286
my grandfather's favorite thing to do
in the whole world was to read.

00:14:12.310 --> 00:14:14.976
But he also loved his congregation,

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:17.976
and you could feel this love
in the sermons that he gave

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:21.976
every week for the 62 years
that he was a rabbi.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:24.976
He would takes the fruits
of each week's reading

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:26.312
and he would weave

00:14:26.336 --> 00:14:29.177
these intricate tapestries
of ancient and humanist thought.

00:14:29.201 --> 00:14:31.839
And people would come from all over
to hear him speak.

00:14:32.703 --> 00:14:34.976
But here's the thing about my grandfather.

00:14:36.067 --> 00:14:37.676
Underneath this ceremonial role,

00:14:37.700 --> 00:14:39.976
he was really modest
and really introverted --

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.976
so much so that when
he delivered these sermons,

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:44.976
he had trouble making eye contact

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:49.000
with the very same congregation
that he had been speaking to for 62 years.

00:14:49.024 --> 00:14:50.976
And even away from the podium,

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:52.976
when you called him to say hello,

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:55.239
he would often end
the conversation prematurely

00:14:55.263 --> 00:14:58.976
for fear that he was taking up
too much of your time.

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:01.976
But when he died at the age of 94,

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:04.976
the police had to close down
the streets of his neighborhood

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:08.910
to accommodate the crowd of people
who came out to mourn him.

00:15:11.846 --> 00:15:14.876
And so these days I try to learn
from my grandfather's example

00:15:14.900 --> 00:15:16.276
in my own way.

00:15:16.300 --> 00:15:18.976
So I just published a book
about introversion,

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:21.000
and it took me about seven years to write.

00:15:21.024 --> 00:15:23.976
And for me, that seven years
was like total bliss,

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:26.976
because I was reading, I was writing,

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:28.976
I was thinking, I was researching.

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:30.976
It was my version

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:33.976
of my grandfather's hours
of the day alone in his library.

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:36.976
But now all of a sudden
my job is very different,

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:39.976
and my job is to be
out here talking about it,

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:42.976
talking about introversion.

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:46.976
(Laughter)

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:48.976
And that's a lot harder for me,

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:52.976
because as honored as I am
to be here with all of you right now,

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:55.976
this is not my natural milieu.

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:59.976
So I prepared for moments
like these as best I could.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:02.286
I spent the last year
practicing public speaking

00:16:02.310 --> 00:16:03.976
every chance I could get.

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:06.976
And I call this my "year
of speaking dangerously."

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:08.976
(Laughter)

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:10.976
And that actually helped a lot.

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:12.976
But I'll tell you, what helps even more

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:17.976
is my sense, my belief, my hope
that when it comes to our attitudes

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:20.120
to introversion and to quiet
and to solitude,

00:16:20.144 --> 00:16:22.621
we truly are poised on the brink
on dramatic change.

00:16:22.645 --> 00:16:23.976
I mean, we are.

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:25.976
And so I am going to leave you now

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:29.976
with three calls for action
for those who share this vision.

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:31.976
Number one:

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:33.976
Stop the madness for constant group work.

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:35.976
Just stop it.

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:38.976
(Laughter)

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:40.976
Thank you.

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:42.976
(Applause)

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:45.143
And I want to be clear
about what I'm saying,

00:16:45.167 --> 00:16:46.976
because I deeply believe our offices

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:50.976
should be encouraging casual, chatty
cafe-style types of interactions --

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:53.120
you know, the kind
where people come together

00:16:53.144 --> 00:16:55.335
and serendipitously have
an exchange of ideas.

00:16:55.359 --> 00:16:56.976
That is great.

00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:59.676
It's great for introverts
and it's great for extroverts.

00:16:59.700 --> 00:17:02.129
But we need much more privacy
and much more freedom

00:17:02.153 --> 00:17:03.676
and much more autonomy at work.

00:17:03.700 --> 00:17:04.976
School, same thing.

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:07.976
We need to be teaching kids
to work together, for sure,

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:10.976
but we also need to be teaching them
how to work on their own.

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:13.776
This is especially important
for extroverted children too.

00:17:13.800 --> 00:17:15.276
They need to work on their own

00:17:15.300 --> 00:17:17.872
because that is where deep thought
comes from in part.

00:17:17.896 --> 00:17:19.976
Okay, number two: Go to the wilderness.

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:22.976
Be like Buddha, have your own revelations.

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:24.976
I'm not saying

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:28.239
that we all have to now go off and build
our own cabins in the woods

00:17:28.263 --> 00:17:30.976
and never talk to each other again,

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:33.334
but I am saying that we could
all stand to unplug

00:17:33.358 --> 00:17:38.000
and get inside our own heads
a little more often.

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:41.976
Number three:

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:44.429
Take a good look
at what's inside your own suitcase

00:17:44.453 --> 00:17:45.976
and why you put it there.

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:47.976
So extroverts,

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:50.073
maybe your suitcases
are also full of books.

00:17:50.097 --> 00:17:54.976
Or maybe they're full of champagne glasses
or skydiving equipment.

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:58.976
Whatever it is, I hope you take
these things out every chance you get

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:01.976
and grace us with your energy
and your joy.

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:04.976
But introverts, you being you,

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:07.554
you probably have the impulse
to guard very carefully

00:18:07.578 --> 00:18:09.454
what's inside your own suitcase.

00:18:09.478 --> 00:18:10.976
And that's okay.

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:12.976
But occasionally, just occasionally,

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:16.000
I hope you will open up your suitcases
for other people to see,

00:18:16.024 --> 00:18:19.024
because the world needs you and it
needs the things you carry.

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:23.239
So I wish you the best
of all possible journeys

00:18:23.263 --> 00:18:25.976
and the courage to speak softly.

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:27.976
Thank you very much.

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:31.976
(Applause)

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:34.976
Thank you. Thank you.

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:42.000
(Applause)
