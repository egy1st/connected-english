WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Well this is a really extraordinary honor for me.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
I spend most of my time

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
in jails, in prisons, on death row.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
I spend most of my time in very low-income communities

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
in the projects and places where there's a great deal of hopelessness.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
And being here at TED

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
and seeing the stimulation, hearing it,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
has been very, very energizing to me.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
And one of the things that's emerged in my short time here

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
is that TED has an identity.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
And you can actually say things here

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
that have impacts around the world.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
And sometimes when it comes through TED,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
it has meaning and power

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
that it doesn't have when it doesn't.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
And I mention that because I think identity is really important.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
And we've had some fantastic presentations.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
And I think what we've learned

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
is that, if you're a teacher your words can be meaningful,

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
but if you're a compassionate teacher,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
they can be especially meaningful.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
If you're a doctor you can do some good things,

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
but if you're a caring doctor you can do some other things.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
And so I want to talk about the power of identity.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
And I didn't learn about this actually

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
practicing law and doing the work that I do.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
I actually learned about this from my grandmother.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
I grew up in a house

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
that was the traditional African-American home

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
that was dominated by a matriarch,

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
and that matriarch was my grandmother.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
She was tough, she was strong,

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
she was powerful.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.000
She was the end of every argument in our family.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
She was the beginning of a lot of arguments in our family.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
She was the daughter of people who were actually enslaved.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
Her parents were born in slavery in Virginia in the 1840's.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
She was born in the 1880's

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
and the experience of slavery

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
very much shaped the way she saw the world.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
And my grandmother was tough, but she was also loving.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
When I would see her as a little boy,

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
she'd come up to me and she'd give me these hugs.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
And she'd squeeze me so tight I could barely breathe

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
and then she'd let me go.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
And an hour or two later, if I saw her,

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
she'd come over to me and she'd say, "Bryan, do you still feel me hugging you?"

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
And if I said, "No," she'd assault me again,

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
and if I said, "Yes," she'd leave me alone.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
And she just had this quality

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
that you always wanted to be near her.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
And the only challenge was that she had 10 children.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
My mom was the youngest of her 10 kids.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
And sometimes when I would go and spend time with her,

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
it would be difficult to get her time and attention.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
My cousins would be running around everywhere.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
And I remember, when I was about eight or nine years old,

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
waking up one morning, going into the living room,

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
and all of my cousins were running around.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
And my grandmother was sitting across the room

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
staring at me.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
And at first I thought we were playing a game.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
And I would look at her and I'd smile,

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
but she was very serious.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
And after about 15 or 20 minutes of this,

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000
she got up and she came across the room

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
and she took me by the hand

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
and she said, "Come on, Bryan. You and I are going to have a talk."

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.000
And I remember this just like it happened yesterday.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
I never will forget it.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
She took me out back and she said, "Bryan, I'm going to tell you something,

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
but you don't tell anybody what I tell you."

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
I said, "Okay, Mama."

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000
She said, "Now you make sure you don't do that." I said, "Sure."

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000
Then she sat me down and she looked at me

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
and she said, "I want you to know

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000
I've been watching you."

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000
And she said, "I think you're special."

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.000
She said, "I think you can do anything you want to do."

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000
I will never forget it.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000
And then she said, "I just need you to promise me three things, Bryan."

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
I said, "Okay, Mama."

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
She said, "The first thing I want you to promise me

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
is that you'll always love your mom."

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
She said, "That's my baby girl,

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000
and you have to promise me now you'll always take care of her."

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.000
Well I adored my mom, so I said, "Yes, Mama. I'll do that."

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000
Then she said, "The second thing I want you to promise me

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
is that you'll always do the right thing

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.000
even when the right thing is the hard thing."

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.000
And I thought about it and I said, "Yes, Mama. I'll do that."

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000
Then finally she said, "The third thing I want you to promise me

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.000
is that you'll never drink alcohol."

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000
(Laughter)

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000
Well I was nine years old, so I said, "Yes, Mama. I'll do that."

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000
I grew up in the country in the rural South,

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.000
and I have a brother a year older than me and a sister a year younger.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000
When I was about 14 or 15,

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000
one day my brother came home and he had this six-pack of beer --

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
I don't know where he got it --

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
and he grabbed me and my sister and we went out in the woods.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.000
And we were kind of just out there doing the stuff we crazily did.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.000
And he had a sip of this beer and he gave some to my sister and she had some,

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000
and they offered it to me.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000
I said, "No, no, no. That's okay. You all go ahead. I'm not going to have any beer."

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000
My brother said, "Come on. We're doing this today; you always do what we do.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000
I had some, your sister had some. Have some beer."

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000
I said, "No, I don't feel right about that. Y'all go ahead. Y'all go ahead."

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000
And then my brother started staring at me.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000
He said, "What's wrong with you? Have some beer."

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000
Then he looked at me real hard and he said,

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
"Oh, I hope you're not still hung up

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
on that conversation Mama had with you."

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
(Laughter)

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000
I said, "Well, what are you talking about?"

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.000
He said, "Oh, Mama tells all the grandkids that they're special."

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.000
(Laughter)

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000
I was devastated.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000
(Laughter)

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000
And I'm going to admit something to you.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000
I'm going to tell you something I probably shouldn't.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000
I know this might be broadcast broadly.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
But I'm 52 years old,

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000
and I'm going to admit to you

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000
that I've never had a drop of alcohol.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000
(Applause)

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.000
I don't say that because I think that's virtuous;

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:06.000
I say that because there is power in identity.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000
When we create the right kind of identity,

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000
we can say things to the world around us

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000
that they don't actually believe makes sense.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000
We can get them to do things

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000
that they don't think they can do.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000
When I thought about my grandmother,

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000
of course she would think all her grandkids were special.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.000
My grandfather was in prison during prohibition.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000
My male uncles died of alcohol-related diseases.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.000
And these were the things she thought we needed to commit to.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000
Well I've been trying to say something

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000
about our criminal justice system.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.000
This country is very different today

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000
than it was 40 years ago.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.000
In 1972, there were 300,000 people in jails and prisons.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:44.000
Today, there are 2.3 million.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000
The United States now has the highest rate of incarceration

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.000
in the world.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.000
We have seven million people on probation and parole.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.000
And mass incarceration, in my judgment,

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.000
has fundamentally changed our world.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.000
In poor communities, in communities of color

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000
there is this despair,

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.000
there is this hopelessness,

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000
that is being shaped by these outcomes.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000
One out of three black men

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.000
between the ages of 18 and 30

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.000
is in jail, in prison, on probation or parole.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000
In urban communities across this country --

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.000
Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Baltimore, Washington --

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.000
50 to 60 percent of all young men of color are

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.000
in jail or prison or on probation or parole.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.000
Our system isn't just being shaped

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000
in these ways that seem to be distorting around race,

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000
they're also distorted by poverty.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.000
We have a system of justice in this country

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000
that treats you much better

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.000
if you're rich and guilty than if you're poor and innocent.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:40.000
Wealth, not culpability,

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000
shapes outcomes.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.000
And yet, we seem to be very comfortable.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000
The politics of fear and anger

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000
have made us believe

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:52.000
that these are problems that are not our problems.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000
We've been disconnected.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000
It's interesting to me.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.000
We're looking at some very interesting developments in our work.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000
My state of Alabama, like a number of states,

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000
actually permanently disenfranchises you

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000
if you have a criminal conviction.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.000
Right now in Alabama

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.000
34 percent of the black male population

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.000
has permanently lost the right to vote.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.000
We're actually projecting in another 10 years

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.000
the level of disenfranchisement

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.000
will be as high as it's been

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.000
since prior to the passage of the Voting Rights Act.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:22.000
And there is this stunning silence.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.000
I represent children.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.000
A lot of my clients are very young.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.000
The United States is the only country in the world

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000
where we sentence 13-year-old children

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000
to die in prison.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.000
We have life imprisonment without parole for kids in this country.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.000
And we're actually doing some litigation.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.000
The only country in the world.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.000
I represent people on death row.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.000
It's interesting, this question of the death penalty.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.000
In many ways, we've been taught to think

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.000
that the real question is,

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:50.000
do people deserve to die for the crimes they've committed?

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000
And that's a very sensible question.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000
But there's another way of thinking

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.000
about where we are in our identity.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.000
The other way of thinking about it

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000
is not, do people deserve to die for the crimes they commit,

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000
but do we deserve to kill?

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000
I mean, it's fascinating.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:07.000
Death penalty in America is defined by error.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.000
For every nine people who have been executed,

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.000
we've actually identified one innocent person

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:14.000
who's been exonerated and released from death row.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:17.000
A kind of astonishing error rate --

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:20.000
one out of nine people innocent.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.000
I mean, it's fascinating.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:25.000
In aviation, we would never let people fly on airplanes

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.000
if for every nine planes that took off

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.000
one would crash.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:32.000
But somehow we can insulate ourselves from this problem.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.000
It's not our problem.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.000
It's not our burden.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.000
It's not our struggle.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.000
I talk a lot about these issues.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000
I talk about race and this question

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.000
of whether we deserve to kill.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000
And it's interesting, when I teach my students about African-American history,

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.000
I tell them about slavery.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000
I tell them about terrorism,

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.000
the era that began at the end of reconstruction

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.000
that went on to World War II.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.000
We don't really know very much about it.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.000
But for African-Americans in this country,

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.000
that was an era defined by terror.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000
In many communities, people had to worry about being lynched.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000
They had to worry about being bombed.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.000
It was the threat of terror that shaped their lives.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.000
And these older people come up to me now

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:11.000
and they say, "Mr. Stevenson, you give talks, you make speeches,

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.000
you tell people to stop saying

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:16.000
we're dealing with terrorism for the first time in our nation's history

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.000
after 9/11."

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:21.000
They tell me to say, "No, tell them that we grew up with that."

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.000
And that era of terrorism, of course,

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.000
was followed by segregation

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.000
and decades of racial subordination

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.000
and apartheid.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:32.000
And yet, we have in this country this dynamic

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:35.000
where we really don't like to talk about our problems.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:38.000
We don't like to talk about our history.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:41.000
And because of that, we really haven't understood

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:44.000
what it's meant to do the things we've done historically.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.000
We're constantly running into each other.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.000
We're constantly creating tensions and conflicts.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:51.000
We have a hard time talking about race,

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:55.000
and I believe it's because we are unwilling to commit ourselves

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.000
to a process of truth and reconciliation.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.000
In South Africa, people understood

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.000
that we couldn't overcome apartheid

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.000
without a commitment to truth and reconciliation.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:06.000
In Rwanda, even after the genocide, there was this commitment,

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.000
but in this country we haven't done that.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:11.000
I was giving some lectures in Germany about the death penalty.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.000
It was fascinating

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:16.000
because one of the scholars stood up after the presentation

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.000
and said, "Well you know it's deeply troubling

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.000
to hear what you're talking about."

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:23.000
He said, "We don't have the death penalty in Germany.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:26.000
And of course, we can never have the death penalty in Germany."

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.000
And the room got very quiet,

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.000
and this woman said,

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:33.000
"There's no way, with our history,

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.000
we could ever engage

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.000
in the systematic killing of human beings.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:41.000
It would be unconscionable for us

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.000
to, in an intentional and deliberate way,

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:46.000
set about executing people."

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.000
And I thought about that.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.000
What would it feel like

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.000
to be living in a world

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:55.000
where the nation state of Germany was executing people,

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.000
especially if they were disproportionately Jewish?

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.000
I couldn't bear it.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.000
It would be unconscionable.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:03.000
And yet, in this country,

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:05.000
in the states of the Old South,

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:07.000
we execute people --

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.000
where you're 11 times more likely to get the death penalty

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.000
if the victim is white than if the victim is black,

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.000
22 times more likely to get it

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.000
if the defendant is black and the victim is white --

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.000
in the very states where there are buried in the ground

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.000
the bodies of people who were lynched.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:23.000
And yet, there is this disconnect.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:27.000
Well I believe that our identity is at risk.

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:30.000
That when we actually don't care

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:33.000
about these difficult things,

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.000
the positive and wonderful things

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:38.000
are nonetheless implicated.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.000
We love innovation.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:43.000
We love technology. We love creativity.

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.000
We love entertainment.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:47.000
But ultimately,

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.000
those realities

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:52.000
are shadowed by suffering,

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.000
abuse, degradation,

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.000
marginalization.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.000
And for me, it becomes necessary

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.000
to integrate the two.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.000
Because ultimately we are talking

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.000
about a need to be more hopeful,

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:07.000
more committed, more dedicated

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:10.000
to the basic challenges of living in a complex world.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:13.000
And for me that means

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:15.000
spending time thinking and talking

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:18.000
about the poor, the disadvantaged,

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.000
those who will never get to TED.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.000
But thinking about them in a way

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:24.000
that is integrated in our own lives.

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:28.000
You know ultimately, we all have to believe things we haven't seen.

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:32.000
We do. As rational as we are, as committed to intellect as we are.

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.000
Innovation, creativity,

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.000
development comes

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.000
not from the ideas in our mind alone.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:41.000
They come from the ideas in our mind

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.000
that are also fueled

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:45.000
by some conviction in our heart.

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:47.000
And it's that mind-heart connection

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:49.000
that I believe compels us

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:51.000
to not just be attentive

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:54.000
to all the bright and dazzly things,

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:57.000
but also the dark and difficult things.

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:00.000
Vaclav Havel, the great Czech leader, talked about this.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:03.000
He said, "When we were in Eastern Europe and dealing with oppression,

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:05.000
we wanted all kinds of things,

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:07.000
but mostly what we needed was hope,

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:09.000
an orientation of the spirit,

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:11.000
a willingness to sometimes be in hopeless places

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:13.000
and be a witness."

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:15.000
Well that orientation of the spirit

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:18.000
is very much at the core of what I believe

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:20.000
even TED communities

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.000
have to be engaged in.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.000
There is no disconnect

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:27.000
around technology and design

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:29.000
that will allow us to be fully human

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:32.000
until we pay attention to suffering,

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:35.000
to poverty, to exclusion, to unfairness, to injustice.

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:37.000
Now I will warn you

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:39.000
that this kind of identity

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:42.000
is a much more challenging identity

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.000
than ones that don't pay attention to this.

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:46.000
It will get to you.

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:49.000
I had the great privilege, when I was a young lawyer, of meeting Rosa Parks.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:52.000
And Ms. Parks used to come back to Montgomery every now and then,

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:54.000
and she would get together with two of her dearest friends,

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.000
these older women,

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:58.000
Johnnie Carr who was the organizer

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:00.000
of the Montgomery bus boycott --

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.000
amazing African-American woman --

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.000
and Virginia Durr, a white woman,

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:06.000
whose husband, Clifford Durr, represented Dr. King.

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:09.000
And these women would get together and just talk.

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:11.000
And every now and then Ms. Carr would call me,

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:14.000
and she'd say, "Bryan, Ms. Parks is coming to town. We're going to get together and talk.

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.000
Do you want to come over and listen?"

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.000
And I'd say, "Yes, Ma'am, I do."

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:20.000
And she'd say, "Well what are you going to do when you get here?"

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:22.000
I said, "I'm going to listen."

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:24.000
And I'd go over there and I would, I would just listen.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.000
It would be so energizing and so empowering.

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:29.000
And one time I was over there listening to these women talk,

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:31.000
and after a couple of hours Ms. Parks turned to me

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:34.000
and she said, "Now Bryan, tell me what the Equal Justice Initiative is.

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:36.000
Tell me what you're trying to do."

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:38.000
And I began giving her my rap.

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:40.000
I said, "Well we're trying to challenge injustice.

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.000
We're trying to help people who have been wrongly convicted.

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:44.000
We're trying to confront bias and discrimination

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.000
in the administration of criminal justice.

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:49.000
We're trying to end life without parole sentences for children.

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:51.000
We're trying to do something about the death penalty.

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:53.000
We're trying to reduce the prison population.

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:55.000
We're trying to end mass incarceration."

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:57.000
I gave her my whole rap, and when I finished she looked at me

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:00.000
and she said, "Mmm mmm mmm."

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:03.000
She said, "That's going to make you tired, tired, tired."

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:05.000
(Laughter)

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:07.000
And that's when Ms. Carr leaned forward, she put her finger in my face,

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:13.000
she said, "That's why you've got to be brave, brave, brave."

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:16.000
And I actually believe that the TED community

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:18.000
needs to be more courageous.

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.000
We need to find ways

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:22.000
to embrace these challenges,

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:24.000
these problems, the suffering.

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:27.000
Because ultimately, our humanity depends

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:29.000
on everyone's humanity.

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:31.000
I've learned very simple things doing the work that I do.

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:33.000
It's just taught me very simple things.

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:36.000
I've come to understand and to believe

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:38.000
that each of us

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:40.000
is more than the worst thing we've ever done.

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:43.000
I believe that for every person on the planet.

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:46.000
I think if somebody tells a lie, they're not just a liar.

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:48.000
I think if somebody takes something that doesn't belong to them,

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:50.000
they're not just a thief.

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:53.000
I think even if you kill someone, you're not just a killer.

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:56.000
And because of that there's this basic human dignity

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:58.000
that must be respected by law.

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:00.000
I also believe

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:02.000
that in many parts of this country,

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:06.000
and certainly in many parts of this globe,

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:08.000
that the opposite of poverty is not wealth.

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:10.000
I don't believe that.

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:13.000
I actually think, in too many places,

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:16.000
the opposite of poverty is justice.

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:19.000
And finally, I believe

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:22.000
that, despite the fact that it is so dramatic

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:24.000
and so beautiful and so inspiring

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:26.000
and so stimulating,

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:29.000
we will ultimately not be judged by our technology,

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:32.000
we won't be judged by our design,

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:35.000
we won't be judged by our intellect and reason.

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:38.000
Ultimately, you judge the character of a society,

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:41.000
not by how they treat their rich and the powerful and the privileged,

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:43.000
but by how they treat the poor,

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:45.000
the condemned, the incarcerated.

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:47.000
Because it's in that nexus

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:50.000
that we actually begin to understand truly profound things

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:54.000
about who we are.

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:56.000
I sometimes get out of balance. I'll end with this story.

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:58.000
I sometimes push too hard.

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:00.000
I do get tired, as we all do.

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:03.000
Sometimes those ideas get ahead of our thinking

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:05.000
in ways that are important.

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:07.000
And I've been representing these kids

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:09.000
who have been sentenced to do these very harsh sentences.

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:12.000
And I go to the jail and I see my client who's 13 and 14,

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:15.000
and he's been certified to stand trial as an adult.

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:17.000
I start thinking, well, how did that happen?

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:19.000
How can a judge turn you into something

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:21.000
that you're not?

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:24.000
And the judge has certified him as an adult, but I see this kid.

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:26.000
And I was up too late one night and I starting thinking,

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:28.000
well gosh, if the judge can turn you into something that you're not,

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:30.000
the judge must have magic power.

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:33.000
Yeah, Bryan, the judge has some magic power.

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:35.000
You should ask for some of that.

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:37.000
And because I was up too late, wasn't thinking real straight,

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:39.000
I started working on a motion.

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:42.000
And I had a client who was 14 years old, a young, poor black kid.

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:44.000
And I started working on this motion,

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:46.000
and the head of the motion was: "Motion to try my poor,

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:48.000
14-year-old black male client

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:50.000
like a privileged, white 75-year-old

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:52.000
corporate executive."

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:57.000
(Applause)

00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:59.000
And I put in my motion

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:02.000
that there was prosecutorial misconduct and police misconduct and judicial misconduct.

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:04.000
There was a crazy line in there about how there's no conduct in this county,

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:06.000
it's all misconduct.

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:09.000
And the next morning, I woke up and I thought, now did I dream that crazy motion,

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:11.000
or did I actually write it?

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:13.000
And to my horror, not only had I written it,

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:15.000
but I had sent it to court.

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:18.000
(Applause)

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:21.000
A couple months went by,

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:23.000
and I had just forgotten all about it.

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:25.000
And I finally decided,

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:27.000
oh gosh, I've got to go to the court and do this crazy case.

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:29.000
And I got into my car

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:31.000
and I was feeling really overwhelmed -- overwhelmed.

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:33.000
And I got in my car and I went to this courthouse.

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:36.000
And I was thinking, this is going to be so difficult, so painful.

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:39.000
And I finally got out of the car and I started walking up to the courthouse.

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:41.000
And as I was walking up the steps of this courthouse,

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:44.000
there was an older black man who was the janitor in this courthouse.

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:46.000
When this man saw me, he came over to me

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:48.000
and he said, "Who are you?"

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:51.000
I said, "I'm a lawyer." He said, "You're a lawyer?" I said, "Yes, sir."

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:53.000
And this man came over to me

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:55.000
and he hugged me.

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:57.000
And he whispered in my ear.

00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:59.000
He said, "I'm so proud of you."

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:01.000
And I have to tell you,

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:03.000
it was energizing.

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:05.000
It connected deeply with something in me

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:07.000
about identity,

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:10.000
about the capacity of every person to contribute

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:12.000
to a community, to a perspective that is hopeful.

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:14.000
Well I went into the courtroom.

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:16.000
And as soon as I walked inside, the judge saw me coming in.

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:19.000
He said, "Mr. Stevenson, did you write this crazy motion?"

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:21.000
I said, "Yes, sir. I did." And we started arguing.

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:23.000
And people started coming in because they were just outraged.

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:25.000
I had written these crazy things.

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:27.000
And police officers were coming in

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:29.000
and assistant prosecutors and clerk workers.

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:31.000
And before I knew it, the courtroom was filled with people

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:33.000
angry that we were talking about race,

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:35.000
that we were talking about poverty,

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:37.000
that we were talking about inequality.

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:40.000
And out of the corner of my eye, I could see this janitor pacing back and forth.

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:42.000
And he kept looking through the window, and he could hear all of this holler.

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:44.000
He kept pacing back and forth.

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:47.000
And finally, this older black man with this very worried look on his face

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:50.000
came into the courtroom and sat down behind me,

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:52.000
almost at counsel table.

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:54.000
About 10 minutes later the judge said we would take a break.

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:57.000
And during the break there was a deputy sheriff who was offended

00:19:57.000 --> 00:19:59.000
that the janitor had come into court.

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:01.000
And this deputy jumped up and he ran over to this older black man.

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:04.000
He said, "Jimmy, what are you doing in this courtroom?"

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:06.000
And this older black man stood up

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:08.000
and he looked at that deputy and he looked at me

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:11.000
and he said, "I came into this courtroom

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:13.000
to tell this young man,

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:16.000
keep your eyes on the prize, hold on."

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:18.000
I've come to TED

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:20.000
because I believe that many of you understand

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:22.000
that the moral arc of the universe is long,

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:24.000
but it bends toward justice.

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:27.000
That we cannot be full evolved human beings

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:30.000
until we care about human rights and basic dignity.

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:32.000
That all of our survival

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:34.000
is tied to the survival of everyone.

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:36.000
That our visions of technology and design

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:38.000
and entertainment and creativity

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:40.000
have to be married with visions

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:43.000
of humanity, compassion and justice.

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:45.000
And more than anything,

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:47.000
for those of you who share that,

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:49.000
I've simply come to tell you

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:51.000
to keep your eyes on the prize, hold on.

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:53.000
Thank you very much.

00:20:53.000 --> 00:21:14.000
(Applause)

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:16.000
Chris Anderson: So you heard and saw

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:19.000
an obvious desire by this audience, this community,

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:22.000
to help you on your way and to do something on this issue.

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:24.000
Other than writing a check,

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:27.000
what could we do?

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:29.000
BS: Well there are opportunities all around us.

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:31.000
If you live in the state of California, for example,

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:33.000
there's a referendum coming up this spring

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:35.000
where actually there's going to be an effort

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:38.000
to redirect some of the money we spend on the politics of punishment.

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:40.000
For example, here in California

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:42.000
we're going to spend one billion dollars

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:44.000
on the death penalty in the next five years --

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:47.000
one billion dollars.

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:49.000
And yet, 46 percent of all homicide cases

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:51.000
don't result in arrest.

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:53.000
56 percent of all rape cases don't result.

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:55.000
So there's an opportunity to change that.

00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:57.000
And this referendum would propose having those dollars

00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:00.000
go to law enforcement and safety.

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:02.000
And I think that opportunity exists all around us.

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:04.000
CA: There's been this huge decline

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:07.000
in crime in America over the last three decades.

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:10.000
And part of the narrative of that

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:13.000
is sometimes that it's about increased incarceration rates.

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:15.000
What would you say to someone who believed that?

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:17.000
BS: Well actually the violent crime rate

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:19.000
has remained relatively stable.

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:21.000
The great increase in mass incarceration in this country

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:24.000
wasn't really in violent crime categories.

00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:26.000
It was this misguided war on drugs.

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:28.000
That's where the dramatic increases have come

00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:31.000
in our prison population.

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:34.000
And we got carried away with the rhetoric of punishment.

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:36.000
And so we have three strikes laws

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:38.000
that put people in prison forever

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:41.000
for stealing a bicycle, for low-level property crimes,

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:43.000
rather than making them give those resources back

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:45.000
to the people who they victimized.

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:47.000
I believe we need to do more to help people who are victimized by crime,

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:49.000
not do less.

00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:51.000
And I think our current punishment philosophy

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:53.000
does nothing for no one.

00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:55.000
And I think that's the orientation that we have to change.

00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:57.000
(Applause)

00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:00.000
CA: Bryan, you've struck a massive chord here.

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:02.000
You're an inspiring person.

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:04.000
Thank you so much for coming to TED. Thank you.

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:19.000
(Applause)
