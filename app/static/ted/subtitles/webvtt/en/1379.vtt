00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
A tourist is backpacking

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
through the highlands of Scotland,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
and he stops at a pub to get a drink.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
And the only people in there is a bartender

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
and an old man nursing a beer.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
And he orders a pint, and they sit in silence for a while.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
And suddenly the old man turns to him and goes,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
"You see this bar?

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
I built this bar with my bare hands

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
from the finest wood in the county.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Gave it more love and care than my own child.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
But do they call me MacGregor the bar builder? No."

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Points out the window.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
"You see that stone wall out there?

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
I built that stone wall with my bare hands.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Found every stone, placed them just so through the rain and the cold.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
But do they call me MacGregor the stone wall builder? No."

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
Points out the window.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
"You see that pier on the lake out there?

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
I built that pier with my bare hands.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Drove the pilings against the tide of the sand, plank by plank.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
But do they call me MacGregor the pier builder? No.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
But you fuck one goat ... "

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:07.000
(Laughter)

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
Storytelling --

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
(Laughter)

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
is joke telling.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
It's knowing your punchline,

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
your ending,

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
knowing that everything you're saying, from the first sentence to the last,

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
is leading to a singular goal,

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
and ideally confirming some truth

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
that deepens our understandings

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
of who we are as human beings.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
We all love stories.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
We're born for them.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
Stories affirm who we are.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
We all want affirmations that our lives have meaning.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
And nothing does a greater affirmation

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
than when we connect through stories.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
It can cross the barriers of time,

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
past, present and future,

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
and allow us to experience

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
the similarities between ourselves

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
and through others, real and imagined.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
The children's television host Mr. Rogers

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
always carried in his wallet

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
a quote from a social worker

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
that said, "Frankly, there isn't anyone you couldn't learn to love

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
once you've heard their story."

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
And the way I like to interpret that

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.000
is probably the greatest story commandment,

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000
which is "Make me care" --

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
please, emotionally,

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
intellectually, aesthetically,

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
just make me care.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
We all know what it's like to not care.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000
You've gone through hundreds of TV channels,

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
just switching channel after channel,

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
and then suddenly you actually stop on one.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
It's already halfway over,

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000
but something's caught you and you're drawn in and you care.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
That's not by chance,

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
that's by design.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.000
So it got me thinking, what if I told you my history was story,

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
how I was born for it,

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000
how I learned along the way this subject matter?

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000
And to make it more interesting,

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
we'll start from the ending

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
and we'll go to the beginning.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000
And so if I were going to give you the ending of this story,

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
it would go something like this:

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000
And that's what ultimately led me

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000
to speaking to you here at TED

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000
about story.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000
And the most current story lesson that I've had

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000
was completing the film I've just done

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
this year in 2012.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000
The film is "John Carter." It's based on a book called "The Princess of Mars,"

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000
which was written by Edgar Rice Burroughs.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.000
And Edgar Rice Burroughs actually put himself

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.000
as a character inside this movie, and as the narrator.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.000
And he's summoned by his rich uncle, John Carter, to his mansion

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
with a telegram saying, "See me at once."

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000
But once he gets there,

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.000
he's found out that his uncle has mysteriously passed away

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.000
and been entombed in a mausoleum on the property.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000
(Video) Butler: You won't find a keyhole.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.000
Thing only opens from the inside.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000
He insisted,

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000
no embalming, no open coffin,

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000
no funeral.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000
You don't acquire the kind of wealth your uncle commanded

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
by being like the rest of us, huh?

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
Come, let's go inside.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000
AS: What this scene is doing, and it did in the book,

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000
is it's fundamentally making a promise.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000
It's making a promise to you

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000
that this story will lead somewhere that's worth your time.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.000
And that's what all good stories should do at the beginning, is they should give you a promise.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000
You could do it an infinite amount of ways.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:35.000
Sometimes it's as simple as "Once upon a time ... "

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.000
These Carter books always had Edgar Rice Burroughs as a narrator in it.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000
And I always thought it was such a fantastic device.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.000
It's like a guy inviting you around the campfire,

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.000
or somebody in a bar saying, "Here, let me tell you a story.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000
It didn't happen to me, it happened to somebody else,

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000
but it's going to be worth your time."

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
A well told promise

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.000
is like a pebble being pulled back in a slingshot

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000
and propels you forward through the story

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000
to the end.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000
In 2008,

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.000
I pushed all the theories that I had on story at the time

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.000
to the limits of my understanding on this project.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:13.000

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:09.000

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.000
(Laughter)

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.000
AS: Storytelling without dialogue.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000
It's the purest form of cinematic storytelling.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.000
It's the most inclusive approach you can take.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000
It confirmed something I really had a hunch on,

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000
is that the audience

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000
actually wants to work for their meal.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.000
They just don't want to know that they're doing that.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000
That's your job as a storyteller,

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000
is to hide the fact

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.000
that you're making them work for their meal.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.000
We're born problem solvers.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.000
We're compelled to deduce

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000
and to deduct,

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.000
because that's what we do in real life.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.000
It's this well-organized absence of information

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.000
that draws us in.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:49.000
There's a reason that we're all attracted to an infant or a puppy.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000
It's not just that they're damn cute;

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.000
it's because they can't completely express

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000
what they're thinking and what their intentions are.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.000
And it's like a magnet.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000
We can't stop ourselves

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000
from wanting to complete the sentence and fill it in.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000
I first started

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.000
really understanding this storytelling device

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.000
when I was writing with Bob Peterson on "Finding Nemo."

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:11.000
And we would call this the unifying theory of two plus two.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.000
Make the audience put things together.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000
Don't give them four,

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.000
give them two plus two.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.000
The elements you provide and the order you place them in

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:23.000
is crucial to whether you succeed or fail at engaging the audience.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:26.000
Editors and screenwriters have known this all along.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.000
It's the invisible application

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000
that holds our attention to story.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000
I don't mean to make it sound

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.000
like this is an actual exact science, it's not.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.000
That's what's so special about stories,

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:40.000
they're not a widget, they aren't exact.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.000
Stories are inevitable, if they're good,

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.000
but they're not predictable.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:47.000
I took a seminar in this year

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:50.000
with an acting teacher named Judith Weston.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000
And I learned a key insight to character.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:55.000
She believed that all well-drawn characters

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.000
have a spine.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.000
And the idea is that the character has an inner motor,

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:02.000
a dominant, unconscious goal that they're striving for,

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000
an itch that they can't scratch.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.000
She gave a wonderful example of Michael Corleone,

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.000
Al Pacino's character in "The Godfather,"

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.000
and that probably his spine

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000
was to please his father.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.000
And it's something that always drove all his choices.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.000
Even after his father died,

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:20.000
he was still trying to scratch that itch.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:23.000
I took to this like a duck to water.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:26.000
Wall-E's was to find the beauty.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:29.000
Marlin's, the father in "Finding Nemo,"

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:32.000
was to prevent harm.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:35.000
And Woody's was to do what was best for his child.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:38.000
And these spines don't always drive you to make the best choices.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:41.000
Sometimes you can make some horrible choices with them.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.000
I'm really blessed to be a parent,

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:46.000
and watching my children grow, I really firmly believe

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:49.000
that you're born with a temperament and you're wired a certain way,

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:52.000
and you don't have any say about it,

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.000
and there's no changing it.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:57.000
All you can do is learn to recognize it

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:00.000
and own it.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000
And some of us are born with temperaments that are positive,

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000
some are negative.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:07.000
But a major threshold is passed

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.000
when you mature enough

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.000
to acknowledge what drives you

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.000
and to take the wheel and steer it.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:16.000
As parents, you're always learning who your children are.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.000
They're learning who they are.

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.000
And you're still learning who you are.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:23.000
So we're all learning all the time.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:26.000
And that's why change is fundamental in story.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.000
If things go static, stories die,

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:31.000
because life is never static.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.000
In 1998,

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.000
I had finished writing "Toy Story" and "A Bug's Life"

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.000
and I was completely hooked on screenwriting.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:40.000
So I wanted to become much better at it and learn anything I could.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:43.000
So I researched everything I possibly could.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.000
And I finally came across this fantastic quote

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:48.000
by a British playwright, William Archer:

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.000
"Drama is anticipation

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.000
mingled with uncertainty."

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:55.000
It's an incredibly insightful definition.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.000
When you're telling a story,

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.000
have you constructed anticipation?

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.000
In the short-term, have you made me want to know

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.000
what will happen next?

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.000
But more importantly,

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.000
have you made me want to know

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.000
how it will all conclude in the long-term?

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.000
Have you constructed honest conflicts

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.000
with truth that creates doubt

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.000
in what the outcome might be?

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:17.000
An example would be in "Finding Nemo,"

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.000
in the short tension, you were always worried,

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.000
would Dory's short-term memory

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.000
make her forget whatever she was being told by Marlin.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.000
But under that was this global tension

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.000
of will we ever find Nemo

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.000
in this huge, vast ocean?

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.000
In our earliest days at Pixar,

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:34.000
before we truly understood the invisible workings of story,

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:37.000
we were simply a group of guys just going on our gut, going on our instincts.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.000
And it's interesting to see

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.000
how that led us places

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.000
that were actually pretty good.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:46.000
You've got to remember that in this time of year,

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.000
1993,

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:51.000
what was considered a successful animated picture

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:54.000
was "The Little Mermaid," "Beauty and the Beast,"

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.000
"Aladdin," "Lion King."

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:59.000
So when we pitched "Toy Story" to Tom Hanks for the first time,

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.000
he walked in and he said,

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:03.000
"You don't want me to sing, do you?"

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:05.000
And I thought that epitomized perfectly

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:08.000
what everybody thought animation had to be at the time.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.000
But we really wanted to prove

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:13.000
that you could tell stories completely different in animation.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.000
We didn't have any influence then,

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.000
so we had a little secret list of rules

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.000
that we kept to ourselves.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:22.000
And they were: No songs,

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.000
no "I want" moment,

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.000
no happy village,

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.000
no love story.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.000
And the irony is that, in the first year,

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.000
our story was not working at all

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.000
and Disney was panicking.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:37.000
So they privately got advice

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.000
from a famous lyricist, who I won't name,

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.000
and he faxed them some suggestions.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:43.000
And we got a hold of that fax.

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.000
And the fax said,

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:47.000
there should be songs,

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.000
there should be an "I want" song,

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.000
there should be a happy village song,

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.000
there should be a love story

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.000
and there should be a villain.

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:57.000
And thank goodness

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:00.000
we were just too young, rebellious and contrarian at the time.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:03.000
That just gave us more determination

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:05.000
to prove that you could build a better story.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:07.000
And a year after that, we did conquer it.

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:09.000
And it just went to prove

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:11.000
that storytelling has guidelines,

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.000
not hard, fast rules.

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:15.000
Another fundamental thing we learned

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:17.000
was about liking your main character.

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:19.000
And we had naively thought,

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:21.000
well Woody in "Toy Story" has to become selfless at the end,

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:23.000
so you've got to start from someplace.

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:26.000
So let's make him selfish. And this is what you get.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.000
(Voice Over) Woody: What do you think you're doing?

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.000
Off the bed.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.000
Hey, off the bed!

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.000
Mr. Potato Head: You going to make us, Woody?

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.000
Woody: No, he is.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:40.000
Slinky? Slink ... Slinky!

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:42.000
Get up here and do your job.

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:44.000
Are you deaf?

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:46.000
I said, take care of them.

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.000
Slinky: I'm sorry, Woody,

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.000
but I have to agree with them.

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:52.000
I don't think what you did was right.

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:55.000
Woody: What? Am I hearing correctly?

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.000
You don't think I was right?

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:01.000
Who said your job was to think, Spring Wiener?

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:04.000
AS: So how do you make a selfish character likable?

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:06.000
We realized, you can make him kind,

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.000
generous, funny, considerate,

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:10.000
as long as one condition is met for him,

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.000
is that he stays the top toy.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.000
And that's what it really is,

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.000
is that we all live life conditionally.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.000
We're all willing to play by the rules and follow things along,

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:21.000
as long as certain conditions are met.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.000
After that, all bets are off.

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:26.000
And before I'd even decided to make storytelling my career,

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:28.000
I can now see key things that happened in my youth

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.000
that really sort of opened my eyes

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.000
to certain things about story.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:35.000
In 1986, I truly understood the notion

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:38.000
of story having a theme.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:41.000
And that was the year that they restored and re-released

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:43.000
"Lawrence of Arabia."

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:46.000
And I saw that thing seven times in one month.

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.000
I couldn't get enough of it.

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:51.000
I could just tell there was a grand design under it --

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:53.000
in every shot, every scene, every line.

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.000
Yet, on the surface it just seemed

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:58.000
to be depicting his historical lineage

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:00.000
of what went on.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.000
Yet, there was something more being said. What exactly was it?

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.000
And it wasn't until, on one of my later viewings,

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:06.000
that the veil was lifted

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:09.000
and it was in a scene where he's walked across the Sinai Desert

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:11.000
and he's reached the Suez Canal,

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:13.000
and I suddenly got it.

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:24.000
(Video) Boy: Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:34.000
Cyclist: Who are you?

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:38.000
Who are you?

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:41.000
AS: That was the theme: Who are you?

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:43.000
Here were all these seemingly disparate

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:45.000
events and dialogues

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:48.000
that just were chronologically telling the history of him,

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:50.000
but underneath it was a constant,

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:52.000
a guideline, a road map.

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:54.000
Everything Lawrence did in that movie

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:57.000
was an attempt for him to figure out where his place was in the world.

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:00.000
A strong theme is always running through

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:03.000
a well-told story.

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:05.000
When I was five,

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:08.000
I was introduced to possibly the most major ingredient

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:11.000
that I feel a story should have,

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:13.000
but is rarely invoked.

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:16.000
And this is what my mother took me to when I was five.

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:22.000
(Video) Thumper: Come on. It's all right.

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:24.000
Look.

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:27.000
The water's stiff.

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:32.000
Bambi: Yippee!

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:44.000
Thumper: Some fun,

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:47.000
huh, Bambi?

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:49.000
Come on. Get up.

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:51.000
Like this.

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:12.000
Ha ha. No, no, no.

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:14.000
AS: I walked out of there

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:16.000
wide-eyed with wonder.

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:18.000
And that's what I think the magic ingredient is,

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:20.000
the secret sauce,

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:22.000
is can you invoke wonder.

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:24.000
Wonder is honest, it's completely innocent.

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:26.000
It can't be artificially evoked.

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:28.000
For me, there's no greater ability

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:31.000
than the gift of another human being giving you that feeling --

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:34.000
to hold them still just for a brief moment in their day

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:36.000
and have them surrender to wonder.

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:39.000
When it's tapped, the affirmation of being alive,

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:42.000
it reaches you almost to a cellular level.

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:44.000
And when an artist does that to another artist,

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:46.000
it's like you're compelled to pass it on.

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:48.000
It's like a dormant command

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:51.000
that suddenly is activated in you, like a call to Devil's Tower.

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:54.000
Do unto others what's been done to you.

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:57.000
The best stories infuse wonder.

00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:59.000
When I was four years old,

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:01.000
I have a vivid memory

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:04.000
of finding two pinpoint scars on my ankle

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:06.000
and asking my dad what they were.

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:08.000
And he said I had a matching pair like that on my head,

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:10.000
but I couldn't see them because of my hair.

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:12.000
And he explained that when I was born,

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:14.000
I was born premature,

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:17.000
that I came out much too early,

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:19.000
and I wasn't fully baked;

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:21.000
I was very, very sick.

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:24.000
And when the doctor took a look at this yellow kid with black teeth,

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:26.000
he looked straight at my mom and said,

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:29.000
"He's not going to live."

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:32.000
And I was in the hospital for months.

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:34.000
And many blood transfusions later,

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:36.000
I lived,

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:39.000
and that made me special.

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:42.000
I don't know if I really believe that.

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:45.000
I don't know if my parents really believe that,

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:48.000
but I didn't want to prove them wrong.

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:51.000
Whatever I ended up being good at,

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:55.000
I would strive to be worthy of the second chance I was given.

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:59.000
(Video) (Crying)

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:11.000
Marlin: There, there, there.

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:14.000
It's okay, daddy's here.

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:17.000
Daddy's got you.

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:21.000
I promise,

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:25.000
I will never let anything happen to you, Nemo.

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:29.000
AS: And that's the first story lesson I ever learned.

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:31.000
Use what you know. Draw from it.

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:33.000
It doesn't always mean plot or fact.

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:36.000
It means capturing a truth from your experiencing it,

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:39.000
expressing values you personally feel

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:41.000
deep down in your core.

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:43.000
And that's what ultimately led me to speaking to you

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:45.000
here at TEDTalk today.

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:47.000
Thank you.

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:55.000
(Applause)
