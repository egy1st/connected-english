WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
What do I know

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
that would cause me,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
a reticent, Midwestern scientist,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
to get myself arrested

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
in front of the White House protesting?

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
And what would you do

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
if you knew what I know?

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Let's start with how I got to this point.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
I was lucky to grow up

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
at a time when it was not difficult

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
for the child of a tenant farmer

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
to make his way to the state university.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
And I was really lucky

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
to go to the University of Iowa

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
where I could study under Professor James Van Allen

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
who built instruments

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
for the first U.S. satellites.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
Professor Van Allen told me

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
about observations of Venus,

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
that there was intense microwave radiation.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
Did it mean that Venus had an ionosphere?

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Or was Venus extremely hot?

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
The right answer,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.000
confirmed by the Soviet Venera spacecraft,

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
was that Venus was very hot --

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
900 degrees Fahrenheit.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
And it was kept hot

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
by a thick carbon dioxide atmosphere.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
I was fortunate to join NASA

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
and successfully propose

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
an experiment to fly to Venus.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
Our instrument took this image

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
of the veil of Venus,

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
which turned out to be

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
a smog of sulfuric acid.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
But while our instrument was being built,

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
I became involved in calculations

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
of the greenhouse effect

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
here on Earth,

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
because we realized

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
that our atmospheric composition was changing.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
Eventually, I resigned

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
as principal investigator

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
on our Venus experiment

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
because a planet changing before our eyes

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
is more interesting and important.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
Its changes will affect all of humanity.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
The greenhouse effect had been well understood

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
for more than a century.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
British physicist John Tyndall,

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
in the 1850's,

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
made laboratory measurements

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
of the infrared radiation,

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
which is heat.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
And he showed that gasses such as CO2 absorb heat,

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
thus acting like a blanket

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
warming Earth's surface.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
I worked with other scientists

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.000
to analyze Earth climate observations.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
In 1981,

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000
we published an article in Science magazine

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
concluding that observed warming

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
of 0.4 degrees Celsius

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
in the prior century

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
was consistent with the greenhouse effect

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
of increasing CO2.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000
That Earth would likely warm in the 1980's,

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
and warming would exceed

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
the noise level of random weather

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
by the end of the century.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000
We also said that the 21st century

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000
would see shifting climate zones,

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
creation of drought-prone regions

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
in North America and Asia,

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000
erosion of ice sheets, rising sea levels

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000
and opening of the fabled Northwest Passage.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
All of these impacts

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
have since either happened

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
or are now well under way.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.000
That paper was reported on the front page of the New York Times

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
and led to me testifying to Congress

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
in the 1980's,

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000
testimony in which I emphasized

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000
that global warming increases both extremes

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.000
of the Earth's water cycle.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
Heatwaves and droughts on one hand,

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000
directly from the warming,

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
but also, because a warmer atmosphere

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000
holds more water vapor

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000
with its latent energy,

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000
rainfall will become

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000
in more extreme events.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000
There will be stronger storms and greater flooding.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000
Global warming hoopla

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000
became time-consuming

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000
and distracted me from doing science --

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000
partly because I had complained

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000
that the White House altered my testimony.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000
So I decided to go back

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000
to strictly doing science

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.000
and leave the communication to others.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.000
By 15 years later,

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.000
evidence of global warming was much stronger.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.000
Most of the things mentioned in our 1981 paper

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000
were facts.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.000
I had the privilege to speak twice

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000
to the president's climate task force.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.000
But energy policies continued to focus

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000
on finding more fossil fuels.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000
By then we had two grandchildren,

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000
Sophie and Connor.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000
I decided

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000
that I did not want them in the future

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000
to say, "Opa understood what was happening,

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000
but he didn't make it clear."

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.000
So I decided to give a public talk

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.000
criticizing the lack of an appropriate energy policy.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.000
I gave the talk at the University of Iowa in 2004

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.000
and at the 2005 meeting

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.000
of the American Geophysical Union.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000
This led to calls

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000
from the White House to NASA headquarters

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.000
and I was told that I could not give any talks or speak with the media

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.000
without prior explicit approval

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.000
by NASA headquarters.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000
After I informed the New York Times

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000
about these restrictions,

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.000
NASA was forced to end the censorship.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000
But there were consequences.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000
I had been using the first line

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000
of the NASA mission statement,

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.000
"To understand and protect the home planet,"

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000
to justify my talks.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000
Soon the first line of the mission statement

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:29.000
was deleted, never to appear again.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000
Over the next few years

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.000
I was drawn more and more

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.000
into trying to communicate the urgency

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.000
of a change in energy policies,

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.000
while still researching the physics of climate change.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.000
Let me describe the most important conclusion from the physics --

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.000
first, from Earth's energy balance

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:52.000
and, second, from Earth's climate history.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.000
Adding CO2 to the air

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.000
is like throwing another blanket on the bed.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.000
It reduces Earth's heat radiation to space,

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000
so there's a temporary energy imbalance.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000
More energy is coming in

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000
than going out,

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.000
until Earth warms up enough

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.000
to again radiate to space

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.000
as much energy as it absorbs from the Sun.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000
So the key quantity

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.000
is Earth's energy imbalance.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000
Is there more energy coming in

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000
than going out?

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.000
If so, more warming is in the pipeline.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:29.000
It will occur without adding any more greenhouse gasses.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000
Now finally,

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:35.000
we can measure Earth's energy imbalance precisely

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.000
by measuring the heat content

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:40.000
in Earth's heat reservoirs.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:43.000
The biggest reservoir, the ocean, was the least well measured,

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:46.000
until more than 3,000 Argo floats

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:49.000
were distributed around the world's ocean.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000
These floats reveal

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000
that the upper half of the ocean

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.000
is gaining heat at a substantial rate.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.000
The deep ocean is also gaining heat at a smaller rate,

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000
and energy is going

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:04.000
into the net melting of ice all around the planet.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:07.000
And the land, to depths of tens of meters,

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000
is also warming.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.000
The total energy imbalance now

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:16.000
is about six-tenths of a watt per square meter.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.000
That may not sound like much,

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.000
but when added up over the whole world, it's enormous.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.000
It's about 20 times greater

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.000
than the rate of energy use by all of humanity.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000
It's equivalent to exploding

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:35.000
400,000 Hiroshima atomic bombs per day

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.000
365 days per year.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.000
That's how much extra energy

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.000
Earth is gaining each day.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.000
This imbalance,

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:47.000
if we want to stabilize climate,

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.000
means that we must reduce CO2

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:52.000
from 391 ppm, parts per million,

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:55.000
back to 350 ppm.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:58.000
That is the change needed to restore energy balance

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000
and prevent further warming.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.000
Climate change deniers argue

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.000
that the Sun is the main cause of climate change.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:09.000
But the measured energy imbalance occurred

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:13.000
during the deepest solar minimum in the record,

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:17.000
when the Sun's energy reaching Earth was least.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:20.000
Yet, there was more energy coming in than going out.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:23.000
This shows that the effect of the Sun's variations on climate

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:26.000
is overwhelmed by the increasing greenhouse gasses,

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:29.000
mainly from burning fossil fuels.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:32.000
Now consider Earth's climate history.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.000
These curves for global temperature,

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:37.000
atmospheric CO2 and sea level

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:40.000
were derived from ocean cores and Antarctic ice cores,

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000
from ocean sediments and snowflakes

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.000
that piled up year after year

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.000
over 800,000 years

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.000
forming a two-mile thick ice sheet.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:52.000
As you see, there's a high correlation

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:55.000
between temperature, CO2 and sea level.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.000
Careful examination shows

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.000
that the temperature changes

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.000
slightly lead the CO2 changes

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:04.000
by a few centuries.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:07.000
Climate change deniers like to use this fact

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:10.000
to confuse and trick the public

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:13.000
by saying, "Look, the temperature causes CO2 to change,

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.000
not vice versa."

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.000
But that lag

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:20.000
is exactly what is expected.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:23.000
Small changes in Earth's orbit

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:26.000
that occur over tens to hundreds of thousands of years

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.000
alter the distribution

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.000
of sunlight on Earth.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.000
When there is more sunlight

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:35.000
at high latitudes in summer, ice sheets melt.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.000
Shrinking ice sheets

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.000
make the planet darker,

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.000
so it absorbs more sunlight

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.000
and becomes warmer.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.000
A warmer ocean releases CO2,

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:48.000
just as a warm Coca-Cola does.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:51.000
And more CO2 causes more warming.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:54.000
So CO2, methane, and ice sheets

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.000
were feedbacks

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:59.000
that amplified global temperature change

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:02.000
causing these ancient climate oscillations to be huge,

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:05.000
even though the climate change was initiated

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.000
by a very weak forcing.

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.000
The important point

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.000
is that these same amplifying feedbacks

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.000
will occur today.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.000
The physics does not change.

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:17.000
As Earth warms,

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:20.000
now because of extra CO2 we put in the atmosphere,

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.000
ice will melt,

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.000
and CO2 and methane will be released

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:27.000
by warming ocean and melting permafrost.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:30.000
While we can't say exactly how fast

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:33.000
these amplifying feedbacks will occur,

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:36.000
it is certain they will occur,

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.000
unless we stop the warming.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.000
There is evidence

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:43.000
that feedbacks are already beginning.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.000
Precise measurements

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.000
by GRACE, the gravity satellite,

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:50.000
reveal that both Greenland and Antarctica

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.000
are now losing mass,

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:55.000
several hundred cubic kilometers per year.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.000
And the rate has accelerated

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.000
since the measurements began

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.000
nine years ago.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:03.000
Methane is also beginning

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:06.000
to escape from the permafrost.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.000
What sea level rise

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.000
can we look forward to?

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:13.000
The last time CO2 was 390 ppm,

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.000
today's value,

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.000
sea level was higher

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:20.000
by at least 15 meters, 50 feet.

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.000
Where you are sitting now

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.000
would be under water.

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:27.000
Most estimates are that, this century,

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.000
we will get at least one meter.

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.000
I think it will be more

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:33.000
if we keep burning fossil fuels,

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:36.000
perhaps even five meters, which is 18 feet,

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:39.000
this century or shortly thereafter.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.000
The important point

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:44.000
is that we will have started a process

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:47.000
that is out of humanity's control.

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:50.000
Ice sheets would continue to disintegrate for centuries.

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.000
There would be no stable shoreline.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:55.000
The economic consequences are almost unthinkable.

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:59.000
Hundreds of New Orleans-like devastations

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.000
around the world.

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.000
What may be more reprehensible,

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:05.000
if climate denial continues,

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:07.000
is extermination of species.

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:09.000
The monarch butterfly

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:14.000
could be one of the 20 to 50 percent of all species

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:17.000
that the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change estimates

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:19.000
will be ticketed for extinction

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:21.000
by the end of the century

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:25.000
if we stay on business-as-usual fossil fuel use.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:28.000
Global warming is already affecting people.

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.000
The Texas, Oklahoma, Mexico

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:33.000
heatwave and drought last year,

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:35.000
Moscow the year before

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:37.000
and Europe in 2003,

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:40.000
were all exceptional events,

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:44.000
more than three standard deviations outside the norm.

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:46.000
Fifty years ago,

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.000
such anomalies

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.000
covered only two- to three-tenths

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:52.000
of one percent of the land area.

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.000
In recent years,

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.000
because of global warming,

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.000
they now cover about 10 percent --

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:01.000
an increase by a factor of 25 to 50.

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:04.000
So we can say with a high degree of confidence

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:06.000
that the severe Texas and Moscow heatwaves

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.000
were not natural;

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:11.000
they were caused by global warming.

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:13.000
An important impact,

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:15.000
if global warming continues,

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:18.000
will be on the breadbasket of our nation and the world,

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:20.000
the Midwest and Great Plains,

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:23.000
which are expected to become prone to extreme droughts,

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:25.000
worse than the Dust Bowl,

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:27.000
within just a few decades,

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:31.000
if we let global warming continue.

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:34.000
How did I get dragged deeper and deeper

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:36.000
into an attempt to communicate,

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:39.000
giving talks in 10 countries, getting arrested,

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:41.000
burning up the vacation time

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:44.000
that I had accumulated over 30 years?

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:48.000
More grandchildren helped me along.

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.000
Jake is a super-positive,

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:53.000
enthusiastic boy.

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.000
Here at age two and a half years,

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.000
he thinks he can protect

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:00.000
his two and a half-day-old little sister.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.000
It would be immoral

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.000
to leave these young people

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:06.000
with a climate system

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:08.000
spiraling out of control.

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:11.000
Now the tragedy about climate change

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:13.000
is that we can solve it

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:15.000
with a simple, honest approach

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:18.000
of a gradually rising carbon fee

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:20.000
collected from fossil fuel companies

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:24.000
and distributed 100 percent electronically

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.000
every month to all legal residents

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.000
on a per capita basis,

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:32.000
with the government not keeping one dime.

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:35.000
Most people would get more in the monthly dividend

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:37.000
than they'd pay in increased prices.

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.000
This fee and dividend

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:41.000
would stimulate the economy

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:43.000
and innovations,

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:45.000
creating millions of jobs.

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:47.000
It is the principal requirement

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:50.000
for moving us rapidly

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:52.000
to a clean energy future.

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:54.000
Several top economists

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:57.000
are coauthors on this proposition.

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:00.000
Jim DiPeso of Republicans for Environmental Protection

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.000
describes it thusly:

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:04.000
"Transparent. Market-based.

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:06.000
Does not enlarge government.

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:09.000
Leaves energy decisions to individual choices.

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:13.000
Sounds like a conservative climate plan."

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:17.000
But instead of placing a rising fee on carbon emissions

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:20.000
to make fossil fuels pay

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:22.000
their true cost to society,

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:25.000
our governments are forcing the public

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:28.000
to subsidize fossil fuels

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:31.000
by 400 to 500 billion dollars

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:33.000
per year worldwide,

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:36.000
thus encouraging extraction of every fossil fuel --

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:38.000
mountaintop removal,

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:40.000
longwall mining, fracking,

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:42.000
tar sands, tar shale,

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:45.000
deep ocean Arctic drilling.

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:47.000
This path, if continued,

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:50.000
guarantees that we will pass tipping points

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:52.000
leading to ice sheet disintegration

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:56.000
that will accelerate out of control of future generations.

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:58.000
A large fraction of species

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:00.000
will be committed to extinction.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:02.000
And increasing intensity of droughts and floods

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:05.000
will severely impact breadbaskets of the world,

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:07.000
causing massive famines

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:10.000
and economic decline.

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:14.000
Imagine a giant asteroid

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:18.000
on a direct collision course with Earth.

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:20.000
That is the equivalent

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:22.000
of what we face now.

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:24.000
Yet, we dither,

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:26.000
taking no action

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:28.000
to divert the asteroid,

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:30.000
even though the longer we wait,

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:34.000
the more difficult and expensive it becomes.

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:36.000
If we had started in 2005,

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:39.000
it would have required emission reductions of three percent per year

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:42.000
to restore planetary energy balance

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:45.000
and stabilize climate this century.

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:47.000
If we start next year,

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:49.000
it is six percent per year.

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:52.000
If we wait 10 years, it is 15 percent per year --

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:54.000
extremely difficult and expensive,

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:57.000
perhaps impossible.

00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:59.000
But we aren't even starting.

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:02.000
So now you know what I know

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:05.000
that is moving me to sound this alarm.

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:08.000
Clearly, I haven't gotten this message across.

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:11.000
The science is clear.

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:13.000
I need your help

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:15.000
to communicate the gravity and the urgency

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:17.000
of this situation

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:19.000
and its solutions

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:21.000
more effectively.

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:23.000
We owe it to our children and grandchildren.

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:25.000
Thank you.

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:30.000
(Applause)
