WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
So a couple of years ago I started a program

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
to try to get the rockstar tech and design people

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
to take a year off

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
and work in the one environment

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
that represents pretty much everything they're supposed to hate;

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
we have them work in government.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
The program is called Code for America,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
and it's a little bit like a Peace Corps for geeks.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
We select a few fellows every year

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
and we have them work with city governments.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Instead of sending them off into the Third World,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
we send them into the wilds of City Hall.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
And there they make great apps, they work with city staffers.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
But really what they're doing is they're showing what's possible

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
with technology today.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
So meet Al.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
Al is a fire hydrant in the city of Boston.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
Here it kind of looks like he's looking for a date,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
but what he's really looking for is for someone to shovel him out when he gets snowed in,

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
because he knows he's not very good at fighting fires

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
when he's covered in four feet of snow.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
Now how did he come to be looking for help

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
in this very unique manner?

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
We had a team of fellows in Boston last year

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
through the Code for America program.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
They were there in February, and it snowed a lot in February last year.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
And they noticed that the city never gets

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
to digging out these fire hydrants.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
But one fellow in particular,

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
a guy named Erik Michaels-Ober,

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
noticed something else,

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
and that's that citizens are shoveling out sidewalks

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
right in front of these things.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
So he did what any good developer would do,

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
he wrote an app.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
It's a cute little app where you can adopt a fire hydrant.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
So you agree to dig it out when it snows.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
If you do, you get to name it,

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
and he called the first one Al.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
And if you don't, someone can steal it from you.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
So it's got cute little game dynamics on it.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
This is a modest little app.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
It's probably the smallest

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
of the 21 apps that the fellows wrote last year.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
But it's doing something

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
that no other government technology does.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
It's spreading virally.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
There's a guy in the I.T. department of the City of Honolulu

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
who saw this app and realized

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
that he could use it, not for snow,

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.000
but to get citizens to adopt tsunami sirens.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
It's very important that these tsunami sirens work,

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
but people steal the batteries out of them.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
So he's getting citizens to check on them.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000
And then Seattle decided to use it

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000
to get citizens to clear out clogged storm drains.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
And Chicago just rolled it out

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000
to get people to sign up to shovel sidewalks when it snows.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
So we now know of nine cities

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
that are planning to use this.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
And this has spread just frictionlessly,

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
organically, naturally.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
If you know anything about government technology,

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.000
you know that this isn't how it normally goes.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
Procuring software usually takes a couple of years.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
We had a team that worked on a project in Boston last year

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
that took three people about two and a half months.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
It was a way that parents could figure out

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
which were the right public schools for their kids.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000
We were told afterward that if that had gone through normal channels,

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000
it would have taken at least two years

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.000
and it would have cost about two million dollars.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
And that's nothing.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
There is one project in the California court system right now

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
that so far cost taxpayers

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000
two billion dollars,

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000
and it doesn't work.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000
And there are projects like this

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
at every level of government.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.000
So an app that takes a couple of days to write

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
and then spreads virally,

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
that's sort of a shot across the bow

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
to the institution of government.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
It suggests how government could work better --

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000
not more like a private company,

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000
as many people think it should.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
And not even like a tech company,

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
but more like the Internet itself.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
And that means permissionless,

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000
it means open, it means generative.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000
And that's important.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000
But what's more important about this app

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000
is that it represents how a new generation

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000
is tackling the problem of government --

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000
not as the problem of an ossified institution,

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000
but as a problem of collective action.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000
And that's great news,

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.000
because, it turns out, we're very good at collective action

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000
with digital technology.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
Now there's a very large community of people

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
that are building the tools that we need

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000
to do things together effectively.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000
It's not just Code for America fellows,

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000
there are hundreds of people all over the country

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000
that are standing and writing civic apps

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:13.000
every day in their own communities.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000
They haven't given up on government.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000
They are frustrated as hell with it,

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000
but they're not complaining about it,

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000
they're fixing it.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000
And these folks know something

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.000
that we've lost sight of.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000
And that's that when you strip away all your feelings

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000
about politics and the line at the DMV

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000
and all those other things

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000
that we're really mad about,

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000
government is, at its core,

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000
in the words of Tim O'Reilly,

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.000
"What we do together that we can't do alone."

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000
Now a lot of people have given up on government.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000
And if you're one of those people,

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.000
I would ask that you reconsider,

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
because things are changing.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.000
Politics is not changing;

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000
government is changing.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000
And because government

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000
ultimately derives its power from us --

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000
remember "We the people?" --

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000
how we think about it

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.000
is going to effect how that change happens.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.000
Now I didn't know very much about government when I started this program.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000
And like a lot of people,

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.000
I thought government was basically about getting people elected to office.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000
Well after two years, I've come to the conclusion

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000
that, especially local government,

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.000
is about opossums.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.000
This is the call center for the services and information line.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000
It's generally where you will get

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000
if you call 311 in your city.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000
If you should ever have the chance

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.000
to staff your city's call center,

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000
as our fellow Scott Silverman did as part of the program --

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.000
in fact, they all do that --

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.000
you will find that people call government

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000
with a very wide range of issues,

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.000
including having an opossum stuck in your house.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.000
So Scott gets this call.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000
He types "Opossum" into this official knowledge base.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.000
He doesn't really come up with anything. He starts with animal control.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.000
And finally, he says, "Look, can you just open all the doors to your house

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000
and play music really loud

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000
and see if the thing leaves?"

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000
So that worked. So booya for Scott.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000
But that wasn't the end of the opossums.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000
Boston doesn't just have a call center.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.000
It has an app, a Web and mobile app,

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.000
called Citizens Connect.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.000
Now we didn't write this app.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000
This is the work of the very smart people

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000
at the Office of New Urban Mechanics in Boston.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.000
So one day -- this is an actual report -- this came in:

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.000
"Opossum in my trashcan. Can't tell if it's dead.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.000
How do I get this removed?"

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000
But what happens with Citizens Connect is different.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.000
So Scott was speaking person-to-person.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.000
But on Citizens Connect everything is public,

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.000
so everybody can see this.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.000
And in this case, a neighbor saw it.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000
And the next report we got said,

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.000
"I walked over to this location,

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.000
found the trashcan behind the house.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:46.000
Opossum? Check. Living? Yep.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.000
Turned trashcan on its side. Walked home.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.000
Goodnight sweet opossum."

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.000
(Laughter)

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000
Pretty simple.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.000
So this is great. This is the digital meeting the physical.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.000
And it's also a great example

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.000
of government getting in on the crowd-sourcing game.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.000
But it's also a great example of government as a platform.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.000
And I don't mean necessarily

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000
a technological definition of platform here.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000
I'm just talking about a platform for people

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.000
to help themselves and to help others.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.000
So one citizen helped another citizen,

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.000
but government played a key role here.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:22.000
It connected those two people.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:25.000
And it could have connected them with government services if they'd been needed,

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:28.000
but a neighbor is a far better and cheaper alternative

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000
to government services.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000
When one neighbor helps another,

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.000
we strengthen our communities.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:37.000
We call animal control, it just costs a lot of money.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.000
Now one of the important things we need to think about government

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:44.000
is that it's not the same thing as politics.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.000
And most people get that,

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:49.000
but they think that one is the input to the other.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.000
That our input to the system of government

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.000
is voting.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.000
Now how many times have we elected a political leader --

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.000
and sometimes we spend a lot of energy

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:00.000
getting a new political leader elected --

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000
and then we sit back and we expect government

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:06.000
to reflect our values and meet our needs,

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:10.000
and then not that much changes?

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:13.000
That's because government is like a vast ocean

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:17.000
and politics is the six-inch layer on top.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.000
And what's under that

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.000
is what we call bureaucracy.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:24.000
And we say that word with such contempt.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000
But it's that contempt

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:29.000
that keeps this thing that we own

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000
and we pay for

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:34.000
as something that's working against us, this other thing,

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:37.000
and then we're disempowering ourselves.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:40.000
People seem to think politics is sexy.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:43.000
If we want this institution to work for us,

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:46.000
we're going to have to make bureaucracy sexy.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:50.000
Because that's where the real work of government happens.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:53.000
We have to engage with the machinery of government.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.000
So that's OccupytheSEC movement has done.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.000
Have you seen these guys?

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.000
It's a group of concerned citizens

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.000
that have written a very detailed

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.000
325-page report

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.000
that's a response to the SEC's request for comment

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.000
on the Financial Reform Bill.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.000
That's not being politically active,

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.000
that's being bureaucratically active.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:16.000
Now for those of us who've given up on government,

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.000
it's time that we asked ourselves

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:21.000
about the world that we want to leave for our children.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.000
You have to see the enormous challenges

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:26.000
that they're going to face.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:29.000
Do we really think we're going to get where we need to go

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.000
without fixing the one institution

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.000
that can act on behalf of all of us?

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.000
We can't do without government,

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.000
but we do need it

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.000
to be more effective.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.000
The good news is that technology is making it possible

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.000
to fundamentally reframe

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.000
the function of government

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:48.000
in a way that can actually scale

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.000
by strengthening civil society.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:53.000
And there's a generation out there that's grown up on the Internet,

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.000
and they know that it's not that hard

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.000
to do things together,

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:01.000
you just have to architect the systems the right way.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:04.000
Now the average age of our fellows is 28,

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.000
so I am, begrudgingly,

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:09.000
almost a generation older than most of them.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.000
This is a generation

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:14.000
that's grown up taking their voices pretty much for granted.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.000
They're not fighting that battle that we're all fighting

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.000
about who gets to speak;

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.000
they all get to speak.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.000
They can express their opinion

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.000
on any channel at any time,

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.000
and they do.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:29.000
So when they're faced with the problem of government,

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.000
they don't care as much

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:33.000
about using their voices.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.000
They're using their hands.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.000
They're using their hands

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:40.000
to write applications that make government work better.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:43.000
And those applications let us use our hands

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:46.000
to make our communities better.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:49.000
That could be shoveling out a hydrant, pulling a weed,

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:53.000
turning over a garbage can with an opossum in it.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:56.000
And certainly, we could have been shoveling out those fire hydrants all along,

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.000
and many people do.

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:01.000
But these apps are like little digital reminders

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:03.000
that we're not just consumers,

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:05.000
and we're not just consumers of government,

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:08.000
putting in our taxes and getting back services.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.000
We're more than that,

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.000
we're citizens.

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:15.000
And we're not going to fix government

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:18.000
until we fix citizenship.

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:22.000
So the question I have for all of you here:

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.000
When it comes to the big, important things

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.000
that we need to do together,

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.000
all of us together,

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:31.000
are we just going to be a crowd of voices,

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:33.000
or are we also going to be

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.000
a crowd of hands?

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:37.000
Thank you.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:49.000
(Applause)
