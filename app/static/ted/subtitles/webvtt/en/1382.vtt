00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Today I'm going to talk

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
about unexpected discoveries.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Now I work in the solar technology industry.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
And my small startup

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
is looking to force ourselves

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
into the environment

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
by paying attention to ...

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
... paying attention to crowd-sourcing.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
It's just a quick video

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
of what we do.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Huh. Hang on a moment.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
It might take a moment to load.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
(Laughter)

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000
We'll just -- we can just skip --

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
I'll just skip through the video instead ...

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:59.000
(Laughter)

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
No.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:12.000
(Laughter)

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
(Laughter)

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:30.000
(Music)

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
This is not ...

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000
(Laughter)

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000
Okay.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
(Laughter)

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000
Solar technology is ...

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
Oh, that's all my time?

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000
Okay. Thank you very much.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:28.000
(Applause)
