WEBVTT

00:00:00.051 --> 00:00:02.023
I'm Kelli Anderson.

00:00:02.573 --> 00:00:04.686
I work as an artist and designer.

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:08.896
And I like to try to find
the hidden talents of everyday things.

00:00:09.354 --> 00:00:10.834
So before I get started,

00:00:10.858 --> 00:00:14.830
I want to show you a fast smattering
of some examples of what I do.

00:00:15.877 --> 00:00:18.495
But this talk today
is really less about what I make

00:00:18.519 --> 00:00:20.927
and is more about why I make these things.

00:00:22.172 --> 00:00:25.674
So, I get to tinker
with everyday experiences.

00:00:26.809 --> 00:00:28.660
As we go through our everyday lives,

00:00:28.684 --> 00:00:32.745
visual and experiential things
exert this invisible authority

00:00:32.769 --> 00:00:35.170
over our brains at all times.

00:00:35.194 --> 00:00:37.766
And they yield this power
in subtle and sneaky ways.

00:00:38.195 --> 00:00:42.999
So visuals, for example, speak volumes
through these teeny, tiny details,

00:00:43.023 --> 00:00:45.495
codified in things like type,

00:00:47.188 --> 00:00:48.460
shape,

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:50.619
color

00:00:51.931 --> 00:00:53.116
and texture.

00:00:53.513 --> 00:00:57.890
So these small, picky things
form the vocabulary

00:00:57.914 --> 00:00:59.987
that come together and make the sentences,

00:01:01.091 --> 00:01:03.711
enabling us to make
tangible things like ...

00:01:05.227 --> 00:01:06.940
a solar-powered Popsicle truck.

00:01:06.964 --> 00:01:08.011
(Laughter)

00:01:08.035 --> 00:01:10.375
It educates the public
about renewable energy.

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:13.260
It's basically a physical
infographic on wheels.

00:01:13.934 --> 00:01:17.800
And this unexpected pairing
of sugar, bright colors

00:01:17.824 --> 00:01:21.282
and the threat of humanity's
self-inflicted demise

00:01:21.306 --> 00:01:24.325
actually makes for a pretty
convincing argument for solar.

00:01:26.562 --> 00:01:30.102
People arrive at experiences
like these with expectations.

00:01:30.553 --> 00:01:31.715
And when we make things,

00:01:31.739 --> 00:01:35.262
we're actively choosing
what to do with those expectations.

00:01:36.355 --> 00:01:39.835
In my work, I want to create
disruptive wonder.

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:42.502
I want to confound these expectations,

00:01:42.526 --> 00:01:44.734
because I think that every day,

00:01:44.758 --> 00:01:48.561
fundamental things
and experiences frame reality

00:01:48.585 --> 00:01:50.637
in a way that we often take for granted.

00:01:51.304 --> 00:01:53.330
The small things we make

00:01:53.354 --> 00:01:56.706
can work to reinforce
our assumptions about the world.

00:01:57.964 --> 00:02:01.162
Or small things can come out of left field

00:02:01.186 --> 00:02:05.179
and draw us into reassessing
our complacent expectations about reality.

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:09.419
This doesn't happen often,
but when it does, it's awesome.

00:02:09.939 --> 00:02:13.609
Because then, these small things act
as sort of a humble back door

00:02:13.633 --> 00:02:17.110
into understanding a reality
that's infinitely surprising.

00:02:19.383 --> 00:02:21.057
So, as a little demonstration,

00:02:21.081 --> 00:02:24.119
back to the most basic
and fundamental part of myself again:

00:02:24.143 --> 00:02:27.697
my name, kellianderson.com,
spelled out in block letters.

00:02:28.207 --> 00:02:30.150
This is how people find me in the world.

00:02:30.174 --> 00:02:31.346
It means me.

00:02:32.068 --> 00:02:33.793
But in a more objective sense,

00:02:33.817 --> 00:02:36.000
it's really just this random
jumble of letters

00:02:36.024 --> 00:02:39.320
that I've confined to
the single possibility of making my name.

00:02:39.918 --> 00:02:42.931
So naturally, I wondered:
What else can these letters spell?

00:02:42.955 --> 00:02:47.228
Turns out, all kinds
of interesting phrases, like ...

00:02:49.732 --> 00:02:52.465
"Ken doll is near dot com."

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:53.994
(Laughter)

00:02:54.853 --> 00:02:56.639
A little bit creepy.

00:02:58.474 --> 00:03:00.607
And "A colder melon skin."

00:03:01.503 --> 00:03:02.657
Period.

00:03:02.681 --> 00:03:03.795
(Laughter)

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:06.231
Far better use of those
kellianderson.com letters,

00:03:06.255 --> 00:03:07.878
I'm sure you'll agree.

00:03:09.545 --> 00:03:13.650
This is a dumb game,
but it underscores a belief I have,

00:03:13.674 --> 00:03:15.361
that the world is full of order

00:03:15.385 --> 00:03:18.180
that doesn't necessarily
deserve our respect.

00:03:18.204 --> 00:03:22.557
Sometimes, there's meaning, justice
and logic present in the way things are.

00:03:23.163 --> 00:03:24.905
But sometimes there just isn't.

00:03:25.579 --> 00:03:29.775
I think that the moment we realize this
is the moment we become creative people,

00:03:29.799 --> 00:03:32.563
because it prompts us to mess things up

00:03:32.587 --> 00:03:35.751
and do something better
with the basic pieces of experience.

00:03:37.823 --> 00:03:41.432
What I'm after in my work,
really, is this:

00:03:41.456 --> 00:03:43.746
the hidden talents of everyday things --

00:03:44.236 --> 00:03:47.742
all of those overlooked powers
bestowed on the things that surround us

00:03:47.766 --> 00:03:52.336
by the wonders of physics,
the complexities of cultural associations

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:55.740
and a gazillion other
only partially chartable things.

00:03:56.563 --> 00:03:58.781
So today, I want to show you
three projects

00:03:58.805 --> 00:04:03.267
that reconsider the vast properties
of commonplace experience

00:04:03.291 --> 00:04:07.462
and try to do something better
by doing something more absurd.

00:04:08.864 --> 00:04:12.402
This first project is a holiday card
I made for my friends.

00:04:12.426 --> 00:04:14.911
My goal in this was
to get people to notice

00:04:14.935 --> 00:04:19.181
this going-through-the-motions holiday
thing that I'm sure we've all felt before.

00:04:19.624 --> 00:04:22.088
And I did that through a holiday card,

00:04:22.112 --> 00:04:23.607
of course.

00:04:23.631 --> 00:04:25.808
From the outside, it looks pretty normal.

00:04:27.019 --> 00:04:29.479
But paper has this memory;

00:04:29.503 --> 00:04:31.657
paper never forgets how it was bent.

00:04:31.681 --> 00:04:33.649
I was able to use that material memory

00:04:33.673 --> 00:04:36.489
to guide the recipient
through the experience of the card.

00:04:36.513 --> 00:04:38.139
So when you first pick it up,

00:04:38.163 --> 00:04:41.827
while floppy, it's clear it wants
to bend in all of these certain ways.

00:04:41.851 --> 00:04:43.546
As people tinker with it,

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:47.500
they discover that bending the card
brings them through this simple story.

00:04:48.729 --> 00:04:51.864
And as you can see,
it's a story about itself.

00:04:51.888 --> 00:04:55.023
(Laughter)

00:04:55.047 --> 00:04:58.836
This card is literally
a four-frame documentary

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:00.691
about receiving the card.

00:05:00.715 --> 00:05:03.272
(Laughter)

00:05:04.499 --> 00:05:06.611
So it's a recursive experience.

00:05:06.635 --> 00:05:08.006
(Applause)

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:09.790
Oh, well, thank you.

00:05:12.252 --> 00:05:15.742
This excites me, because it's a recursive
experience of a holiday card

00:05:15.766 --> 00:05:18.178
that gets the viewer to feel
this repetitive ritual

00:05:18.202 --> 00:05:19.572
of all holiday cards.

00:05:20.503 --> 00:05:22.872
And it begins life
as a humble piece of paper

00:05:22.896 --> 00:05:24.680
that came out of my inkjet printer.

00:05:25.412 --> 00:05:27.069
I think that's pretty cool.

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:34.359
In a sense, that project was all about
ritual becoming empty gesture.

00:05:34.383 --> 00:05:38.575
And it speaks to the fact that the more
an experience repeats itself,

00:05:38.599 --> 00:05:39.784
the less it means --

00:05:39.808 --> 00:05:40.856
(Laughter)

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:43.508
because we begin to take it for granted.

00:05:43.532 --> 00:05:45.573
And that's why cliches aren't interesting,

00:05:45.597 --> 00:05:47.954
and why people get in
car wrecks near their homes.

00:05:47.978 --> 00:05:50.169
When we experience things
over and over again,

00:05:50.193 --> 00:05:51.827
they just lose their gravity.

00:05:53.207 --> 00:05:54.458
So while paper does have

00:05:54.482 --> 00:05:57.715
all of these astonishing,
overlooked capabilities,

00:05:58.534 --> 00:06:02.442
it takes a hell of a lot of intervention
into getting us to see it as new again.

00:06:03.313 --> 00:06:06.802
This next project I want to show you
is a wedding invitation,

00:06:06.826 --> 00:06:09.977
which is a format
practically begging for reinvention.

00:06:10.001 --> 00:06:11.703
(Laughter)

00:06:11.727 --> 00:06:14.246
This is a card I made
for my friends Mike and Karen,

00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:16.397
who happen to be really awesome people.

00:06:17.118 --> 00:06:20.281
Far more awesome, in fact,
than the format of wedding invitations.

00:06:20.305 --> 00:06:23.636
So it was a really good excuse
to push the boundaries of this format.

00:06:24.783 --> 00:06:26.268
And as far as how to push it,

00:06:26.292 --> 00:06:28.638
the facts of our shared
history made it clear

00:06:28.662 --> 00:06:30.653
that this card should be about music.

00:06:30.677 --> 00:06:32.684
We're all total music nerds,

00:06:32.708 --> 00:06:35.374
and Karen and Mike
have even recorded songs together.

00:06:36.128 --> 00:06:40.234
But you know, you also find inspiration
in the darnedest of places.

00:06:40.766 --> 00:06:44.472
And we found some
with this guy, Mr. Wizard --

00:06:44.496 --> 00:06:45.672
(Laughter)

00:06:45.696 --> 00:06:47.322
who had a much-beloved TV show,

00:06:47.346 --> 00:06:50.269
teaching kids about the science
behind everyday things.

00:06:50.293 --> 00:06:54.068
And I remembered this episode
that demonstrated sound is physical,

00:06:54.092 --> 00:06:55.681
with this simple experiment.

00:06:56.408 --> 00:06:58.848
He rolled up a cone of paper,
he taped it shut,

00:06:58.872 --> 00:07:03.968
he taped a needle to the end of it,
and -- voilà! -- it was a record player.

00:07:04.554 --> 00:07:08.683
I remember seeing this as a kid,
and it totally blew my mind.

00:07:09.368 --> 00:07:11.988
If you can make a record player
out of a piece of paper

00:07:12.012 --> 00:07:13.168
and a sewing needle,

00:07:13.192 --> 00:07:15.269
what isn't possible out of the world?

00:07:16.058 --> 00:07:18.410
So I explained this idea
to Mike and Karen,

00:07:18.434 --> 00:07:20.610
and we all decided
that it would be way better

00:07:20.634 --> 00:07:22.777
to make their guests paper record players,

00:07:22.801 --> 00:07:24.858
rather than traditional,
boring invitations.

00:07:24.882 --> 00:07:27.330
We started getting really, really excited.

00:07:27.354 --> 00:07:29.260
And I started getting really nervous,

00:07:29.284 --> 00:07:31.863
because I'm the one
who had to actually make it work.

00:07:31.887 --> 00:07:35.782
So I began spending an inordinate amount
of time thinking about needles:

00:07:35.806 --> 00:07:38.445
Like, would we find needles
with the right fidelity?

00:07:39.047 --> 00:07:40.698
I started calling paper suppliers,

00:07:40.722 --> 00:07:43.214
looking for the paper
with the best audio properties.

00:07:43.238 --> 00:07:44.427
(Laughter)

00:07:44.451 --> 00:07:46.107
And they thought I was crazy.

00:07:48.504 --> 00:07:50.869
Meanwhile, Mike and Karen
were recording a song,

00:07:50.893 --> 00:07:53.257
which they had mastered
to a clear flexi disc.

00:07:53.770 --> 00:07:56.398
I had this black-and-white
character printed on it,

00:07:56.422 --> 00:07:58.281
so that way, when the disc is turned,

00:07:58.305 --> 00:08:01.239
it completes the couple
in all of these different guises.

00:08:01.263 --> 00:08:03.043
(Laughter)

00:08:04.356 --> 00:08:05.902
So we did it, we really did it!

00:08:05.926 --> 00:08:07.736
We made a paper record player --

00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:11.052
200 recipient-operated
paper record players.

00:08:11.076 --> 00:08:14.011
This is an actual recording
of how it sounds.

00:08:14.035 --> 00:08:17.335
And then it segues into
the real song for comparison.

00:08:20.446 --> 00:08:22.125
(Music and singing)

00:08:43.873 --> 00:08:45.371
(Music ends)

00:08:46.785 --> 00:08:49.297
We were so excited
when we finally got that to work.

00:08:49.321 --> 00:08:50.866
(Laughter)

00:08:50.890 --> 00:08:54.338
And I was excited that we uncovered
this hidden talent of paper

00:08:54.362 --> 00:08:55.641
in the process.

00:08:57.405 --> 00:09:01.324
I also love that project
because it brings attention to the fact

00:09:01.348 --> 00:09:04.092
that we approach media
with all these expectations

00:09:04.116 --> 00:09:06.278
that we do not necessarily need.

00:09:07.313 --> 00:09:10.017
We have assumptions
about material experience,

00:09:10.041 --> 00:09:13.335
like that paper should be silent
or that websites should be flat.

00:09:14.191 --> 00:09:16.096
But we also have these assumptions --

00:09:16.120 --> 00:09:17.374
(Laughter)

00:09:17.398 --> 00:09:20.134
that should be a lot scarier
in a democracy,

00:09:20.158 --> 00:09:22.677
because they're like
these little thought loopholes.

00:09:22.701 --> 00:09:25.809
We sleepwalk through our assumptions
about the authority in media

00:09:25.833 --> 00:09:30.822
and assumptions put forth about political
realities by media, like newspapers.

00:09:31.427 --> 00:09:35.733
But I, for one, have faith
in these small, hacked experiences

00:09:35.757 --> 00:09:37.925
to inspire a sense of skepticism

00:09:37.949 --> 00:09:40.542
at this limited reality we've been handed.

00:09:41.026 --> 00:09:43.973
And this next project
demonstrates just that.

00:09:45.510 --> 00:09:48.999
Imagine your normal, everyday
commuter-newspaper-reading ritual.

00:09:49.852 --> 00:09:55.115
But what if you are handed a paper filled
with stories from an alternate reality?

00:09:55.139 --> 00:09:57.177
(Laughter)

00:09:57.201 --> 00:10:01.893
Specifically: What if some crazy person
had meticulously recreated a typical paper

00:10:01.917 --> 00:10:04.383
depicting an alternate reality?

00:10:06.121 --> 00:10:09.543
This is something we actually did do
in the fall of 2008,

00:10:09.567 --> 00:10:12.426
in a project that was conceptualized
by artist Steve Lambert,

00:10:12.450 --> 00:10:13.825
organized by The Yes Men

00:10:13.849 --> 00:10:17.904
and executed by many, many people,
some of whom are me.

00:10:18.511 --> 00:10:21.653
We made a perfectly counterfeited
"New York Times."

00:10:22.288 --> 00:10:24.846
We didn't ask anyone
for permission, we just did it.

00:10:24.870 --> 00:10:25.914
(Laughter)

00:10:25.938 --> 00:10:27.159
We had it mass-produced,

00:10:27.183 --> 00:10:30.285
and we put it in the hands of hundreds
of thousands of commuters

00:10:30.309 --> 00:10:32.481
on a Thursday morning in New York City.

00:10:32.505 --> 00:10:33.716
(Laughter)

00:10:33.740 --> 00:10:36.468
(Applause and cheers)

00:10:36.492 --> 00:10:37.643
Thanks!

00:10:37.667 --> 00:10:39.178
(Applause)

00:10:41.573 --> 00:10:43.017
"Why?," you might ask.

00:10:43.041 --> 00:10:45.557
"Why make a fake newspaper?"

00:10:48.079 --> 00:10:51.356
Well, quite frankly, because the real
newspaper is depressing.

00:10:51.380 --> 00:10:53.215
We ostensibly live in a democracy

00:10:53.239 --> 00:10:56.041
where we should have some say
in what happens in the world.

00:10:56.065 --> 00:10:59.640
But the truth is, we never see the stories
we want to see in the newspaper.

00:11:00.198 --> 00:11:02.701
So we made a paper with only good news.

00:11:02.725 --> 00:11:03.756
(Laughter)

00:11:03.780 --> 00:11:07.383
We put in all the policy ideas
we thought would actually help the world.

00:11:07.407 --> 00:11:10.534
Years before the withdrawal
was even discussed,

00:11:10.558 --> 00:11:12.566
we ended the war in Iraq.

00:11:13.226 --> 00:11:14.978
Years before Occupy Wall Street,

00:11:15.002 --> 00:11:17.009
we put in a maximum wage law --

00:11:17.033 --> 00:11:18.345
(Laughter)

00:11:19.682 --> 00:11:21.606
to end the ginormous wage inequities

00:11:21.630 --> 00:11:23.801
between the lowest and highest
income earners.

00:11:25.525 --> 00:11:28.465
We returned civics class
to high school curriculum.

00:11:28.489 --> 00:11:30.262
(Laughter)

00:11:30.286 --> 00:11:31.696
See? These are good ideas!

00:11:31.720 --> 00:11:34.714
So then students would know
how their government works again.

00:11:36.744 --> 00:11:40.065
There's a very important difference
between these two papers.

00:11:40.089 --> 00:11:41.891
(Laughter)

00:11:41.915 --> 00:11:45.153
While the real "New York Times"
has this slogan of,

00:11:45.177 --> 00:11:47.378
"All the News that's Fit to Print,"

00:11:47.402 --> 00:11:49.766
we offered a more
forward-thinking message of,

00:11:49.790 --> 00:11:51.924
"All the News We Hope to Print."

00:11:51.948 --> 00:11:53.162
(Laughter)

00:11:53.186 --> 00:11:56.521
And that's because our paper is postdated
six months into the future,

00:11:56.545 --> 00:11:58.715
so when people are handed
these on the street,

00:11:58.739 --> 00:12:02.518
they were literally getting an artifact
from the utopian future,

00:12:02.542 --> 00:12:05.083
sort of a blueprint
for an attainably utopian future

00:12:05.107 --> 00:12:08.505
brought about by this very important idea
of popular pressure.

00:12:09.931 --> 00:12:11.956
And our hoax worked perfectly.

00:12:11.980 --> 00:12:14.334
We suspended people
in this strange mental space,

00:12:14.358 --> 00:12:17.094
because while the stories
in the paper couldn't be real,

00:12:17.118 --> 00:12:20.141
it just felt so perfectly,
impeccably real.

00:12:20.165 --> 00:12:22.184
Here's a video showing --

00:12:22.208 --> 00:12:24.406
(Laughter)

00:12:24.430 --> 00:12:26.230
yes, we did that! --

00:12:26.254 --> 00:12:28.685
showing the first few seconds
of conflicted belief,

00:12:28.709 --> 00:12:30.856
where people could feel
for a moment what --

00:12:30.880 --> 00:12:33.329
(Laughter)

00:12:39.996 --> 00:12:41.215
Yes!

00:12:41.960 --> 00:12:43.960
(Laughter)

00:12:49.866 --> 00:12:51.233
This guy's good.

00:12:53.439 --> 00:12:55.439
(Laughter)

00:12:57.453 --> 00:13:00.566
But in order to get this type of reaction,

00:13:00.590 --> 00:13:04.428
our paper had to be radically believable.

00:13:04.452 --> 00:13:08.737
And Daniel Dunnam, my other half, and I
formed the believability team.

00:13:09.728 --> 00:13:11.597
He made sure that the typography,

00:13:11.621 --> 00:13:13.951
the layout, the smell
of the ink -- everything --

00:13:13.975 --> 00:13:15.815
was just like a real "New York Times."

00:13:15.839 --> 00:13:20.802
And I supplied fake advertisements
from the utopian future.

00:13:20.826 --> 00:13:22.397
(Laughter)

00:13:22.421 --> 00:13:25.221
We decided that the utopian future
would be a perfect venue

00:13:25.245 --> 00:13:27.799
to help these companies
who had done wrong in the past

00:13:27.823 --> 00:13:29.699
try making amends for that wrongdoing.

00:13:29.723 --> 00:13:31.208
(Laughter)

00:13:31.232 --> 00:13:34.746
And we do this through the vocabulary
of their own advertising.

00:13:35.280 --> 00:13:38.981
So for Ikea, what if
instead of cheap furniture,

00:13:39.005 --> 00:13:40.785
you could buy your own wind farm?

00:13:40.809 --> 00:13:44.748
It comes flat-packed,
clearly easy to assemble --

00:13:44.772 --> 00:13:47.781
(Laughter)

00:13:47.805 --> 00:13:50.124
with that little zigzag tool
and the wooden pegs.

00:13:50.148 --> 00:13:51.720
That would be awesome, right?

00:13:53.068 --> 00:13:55.106
More nefarious are companies
like De Beers,

00:13:55.130 --> 00:13:57.711
who are making amends
for their sale of blood diamonds

00:13:57.735 --> 00:14:00.378
by donating prosthetics
to war-torn African countries.

00:14:02.726 --> 00:14:05.031
And this is our take
on a used car dealership ad.

00:14:05.055 --> 00:14:07.545
They're now offering
a "cash for polluters" program.

00:14:07.569 --> 00:14:09.587
So now you can trade in your car

00:14:09.611 --> 00:14:13.153
for a non-polluting
type of transportation:

00:14:13.177 --> 00:14:14.502
a bicycle!

00:14:14.526 --> 00:14:16.374
(Laughter)

00:14:16.398 --> 00:14:18.707
And here's my favorite, Dr. Zizmor,

00:14:18.731 --> 00:14:21.896
who is giving you
a beautiful, clear conscience.

00:14:21.920 --> 00:14:24.619
If you haven't taken a ride
on the New York City subway,

00:14:24.643 --> 00:14:26.149
you may not know Dr. Z.

00:14:26.173 --> 00:14:28.020
But if you have, then you do,

00:14:28.044 --> 00:14:31.467
because his cheesy rainbow ads
are everywhere.

00:14:32.149 --> 00:14:34.550
But now he is foregoing
these superficial services.

00:14:34.574 --> 00:14:36.817
He's no longer cleaning up your face,

00:14:36.841 --> 00:14:38.906
now he's cleaning up our mess in Iraq.

00:14:38.930 --> 00:14:40.409
(Laughter)

00:14:41.567 --> 00:14:46.154
So the news of our fake paper
made it onto the real news

00:14:46.178 --> 00:14:47.530
all around the world.

00:14:47.554 --> 00:14:50.563
These unexpected messages of hope
were able to get out there

00:14:50.587 --> 00:14:54.623
through our sheer brazenness
in ripping off the "New York Times,"

00:14:54.647 --> 00:14:59.220
but also because we leveraged this pathway
that no one had expected.

00:14:59.244 --> 00:15:02.902
We pushed our paper beyond
its expected role in reporting the news,

00:15:02.926 --> 00:15:05.348
and we made a blueprint
for a better world.

00:15:07.746 --> 00:15:12.067
With those three projects, I demonstrate
that by rejecting normal order,

00:15:12.091 --> 00:15:14.946
by messing things up
and by rearranging the pieces,

00:15:14.970 --> 00:15:18.789
we can expand our notion
of what we demand from reality.

00:15:19.428 --> 00:15:23.277
So today, I want to put forth this idea
that an avenue to better

00:15:23.301 --> 00:15:25.572
is through a million teeny,
tiny disruptions

00:15:25.596 --> 00:15:27.873
to whatever is sitting in front of you.

00:15:27.897 --> 00:15:30.719
So go mess with the complacently rational.

00:15:30.743 --> 00:15:32.745
And you can see more of my work at:

00:15:34.153 --> 00:15:36.218
I'll snore naked dot com.

00:15:36.242 --> 00:15:37.580
(Laughter)

00:15:37.604 --> 00:15:38.879
Thank you.

00:15:38.903 --> 00:15:40.390
(Applause)
