00:00:02.468 --> 00:00:06.126
I want to discuss with you this afternoon

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:08.588
why you're going to fail
to have a great career.

00:00:08.612 --> 00:00:09.987
(Laughter)

00:00:10.011 --> 00:00:12.205
I'm an economist.

00:00:12.706 --> 00:00:14.089
I do dismal.

00:00:14.823 --> 00:00:18.394
End of the day, it's ready
for dismal remarks.

00:00:19.204 --> 00:00:22.844
I only want to talk to those of you
who want a great career.

00:00:23.185 --> 00:00:26.907
I know some of you have already decided
you want a good career.

00:00:26.931 --> 00:00:28.321
You're going to fail, too.

00:00:28.345 --> 00:00:29.416
(Laughter)

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:32.049
Because -- goodness,
you're all cheery about failing.

00:00:32.073 --> 00:00:33.082
(Laughter)

00:00:33.106 --> 00:00:34.908
Canadian group, undoubtedly.

00:00:34.932 --> 00:00:38.058
(Laughter)

00:00:38.082 --> 00:00:40.900
Those trying to have good careers
are going to fail,

00:00:40.924 --> 00:00:43.844
because, really, good jobs
are now disappearing.

00:00:44.297 --> 00:00:47.634
There are great jobs and great careers,

00:00:47.658 --> 00:00:50.290
and then there are the high-workload,

00:00:50.314 --> 00:00:54.790
high-stress, bloodsucking,
soul-destroying kinds of jobs,

00:00:54.814 --> 00:00:56.515
and practically nothing in-between.

00:00:56.539 --> 00:00:58.940
So people looking for good jobs
are going to fail.

00:00:58.964 --> 00:01:02.146
I want to talk about those
looking for great jobs, great careers,

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:05.026
and why you're going to fail.

00:01:05.937 --> 00:01:11.899
First reason is that no matter
how many times people tell you,

00:01:11.923 --> 00:01:15.153
"If you want a great career,
you have to pursue your passion,

00:01:15.177 --> 00:01:18.422
you have to pursue your dreams,
you have to pursue

00:01:18.446 --> 00:01:21.414
the greatest fascination in your life,"

00:01:21.438 --> 00:01:24.693
you hear it again and again,
and then you decide not to do it.

00:01:24.717 --> 00:01:28.041
It doesn't matter
how many times you download

00:01:28.065 --> 00:01:32.240
Steven J.'s Stanford commencement address,

00:01:32.264 --> 00:01:35.076
you still look at it
and decide not to do it.

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.790
I'm not quite sure
why you decide not to do it.

00:01:37.814 --> 00:01:39.891
You're too lazy to do it. It's too hard.

00:01:39.915 --> 00:01:42.782
You're afraid if you look
for your passion and don't find it,

00:01:42.806 --> 00:01:45.536
you'll feel like you're an idiot,
so then you make excuses

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:48.282
about why you're not going
to look for your passion.

00:01:48.306 --> 00:01:50.202
They are excuses, ladies and gentlemen.

00:01:50.226 --> 00:01:52.401
We're going to go through
a whole long list --

00:01:52.425 --> 00:01:56.691
your creativity in thinking of excuses
not to do what you really need to do

00:01:56.715 --> 00:01:58.937
if you want to have a great career.

00:01:58.961 --> 00:02:04.585
So, for example,
one of your great excuses is:

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:05.966
(Sigh)

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:09.745
"Well, great careers are
really and truly, for most people,

00:02:09.769 --> 00:02:11.896
just a matter of luck.

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:14.992
So I'm going to stand around,
I'm going to try to be lucky,

00:02:15.016 --> 00:02:17.262
and if I'm lucky,
I'll have a great career.

00:02:17.286 --> 00:02:18.896
If not, I'll have a good career."

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:22.523
But a good career is an impossibility,
so that's not going to work.

00:02:22.547 --> 00:02:24.198
Then, your other excuse is,

00:02:24.222 --> 00:02:28.784
"Yes, there are special people
who pursue their passions,

00:02:28.808 --> 00:02:30.142
but they are geniuses.

00:02:30.166 --> 00:02:31.720
They are Steven J.

00:02:31.744 --> 00:02:33.347
I'm not a genius.

00:02:33.371 --> 00:02:35.978
When I was five, I thought I was a genius,

00:02:36.002 --> 00:02:39.922
but my professors have beaten that idea
out of my head long since."

00:02:39.946 --> 00:02:41.301
(Laughter)

00:02:41.325 --> 00:02:45.817
"And now I know
I am completely competent."

00:02:45.841 --> 00:02:48.523
Now, you see, if this was 1950,

00:02:48.547 --> 00:02:51.563
being completely competent --

00:02:51.587 --> 00:02:53.629
that would have given you a great career.

00:02:53.653 --> 00:02:54.806
But guess what?

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:58.551
This is almost 2012,
and saying to the world,

00:02:58.575 --> 00:03:01.890
"I am totally, completely competent,"

00:03:01.914 --> 00:03:05.995
is damning yourself
with the faintest of praise.

00:03:06.424 --> 00:03:08.392
And then, of course, another excuse:

00:03:08.416 --> 00:03:11.972
"Well, I would do this,
I would do this, but, but --

00:03:11.996 --> 00:03:15.503
well, after all, I'm not weird.

00:03:15.963 --> 00:03:18.653
Everybody knows that people
who pursue their passions

00:03:18.677 --> 00:03:20.080
are somewhat obsessive.

00:03:20.104 --> 00:03:21.573
A little strange.

00:03:21.597 --> 00:03:23.232
Hmm? Hmm? Okay?

00:03:23.256 --> 00:03:26.478
You know, a fine line
between madness and genius.

00:03:26.502 --> 00:03:30.787
"I'm not weird. I've read
Steven J.'s biography.

00:03:30.811 --> 00:03:34.670
Oh my goodness --
I'm not that person. I am nice.

00:03:34.694 --> 00:03:36.028
I am normal.

00:03:36.052 --> 00:03:39.850
I'm a nice, normal person,
and nice, normal people --

00:03:41.003 --> 00:03:42.550
don't have passion."

00:03:42.574 --> 00:03:43.598
(Laughter)

00:03:43.622 --> 00:03:46.123
"Ah, but I still want a great career.

00:03:46.147 --> 00:03:48.076
I'm not prepared to pursue my passion,

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:49.631
so I know what I'm going to do,

00:03:49.655 --> 00:03:51.519
because I have a solution.

00:03:51.543 --> 00:03:52.995
I have a strategy.

00:03:53.019 --> 00:03:55.433
It's the one Mommy
and Daddy told me about.

00:03:55.457 --> 00:03:58.512
Mommy and Daddy told me
that if I worked hard,

00:03:58.536 --> 00:04:00.290
I'd have a good career.

00:04:00.877 --> 00:04:03.615
So, if you work hard
and have a good career,

00:04:03.639 --> 00:04:05.647
if you work really, really, really hard,

00:04:05.671 --> 00:04:06.992
you'll have a great career.

00:04:07.016 --> 00:04:09.432
Doesn't that, like,
mathematically make sense?"

00:04:09.456 --> 00:04:10.940
Hmm. Not.

00:04:10.964 --> 00:04:13.429
But you've managed
to talk yourself into that.

00:04:13.453 --> 00:04:15.529
You know what? Here's a little secret:

00:04:15.553 --> 00:04:18.623
You want to work? You want to work
really, really, really hard?

00:04:18.647 --> 00:04:20.100
You know what? You'll succeed.

00:04:20.124 --> 00:04:22.030
The world will give you the opportunity

00:04:22.054 --> 00:04:25.669
to work really, really,
really, really hard.

00:04:25.693 --> 00:04:28.633
But, are you so sure

00:04:28.657 --> 00:04:31.577
that that's going to give you
a great career,

00:04:31.601 --> 00:04:34.419
when all the evidence is to the contrary?

00:04:34.443 --> 00:04:39.946
So let's deal with those of you
who are trying to find your passion.

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:42.643
You actually understand
that you really had better do it,

00:04:42.667 --> 00:04:43.993
never mind the excuses.

00:04:44.017 --> 00:04:46.005
You're trying to find your passion --

00:04:46.658 --> 00:04:47.659
(Sigh)

00:04:47.683 --> 00:04:49.063
and you're so happy.

00:04:49.842 --> 00:04:52.101
You found something you're interested in.

00:04:52.125 --> 00:04:54.166
"I have an interest! I have an interest!"

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:55.348
You tell me.

00:04:55.372 --> 00:04:58.395
You say, "I have an interest!"
I say, "That's wonderful!

00:04:58.419 --> 00:05:00.666
And what are you trying to tell me?"

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:02.205
"Well, I have an interest."

00:05:02.229 --> 00:05:03.789
I say, "Do you have passion?"

00:05:03.813 --> 00:05:05.432
"I have an interest," you say.

00:05:06.022 --> 00:05:07.744
"Your interest is compared to what?"

00:05:07.768 --> 00:05:09.670
"Well, I'm interested in this."

00:05:10.879 --> 00:05:13.977
"And what about the rest
of humanity's activities?"

00:05:14.001 --> 00:05:15.796
"I'm not interested in them."

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:17.923
"You've looked at them all, have you?"

00:05:17.947 --> 00:05:20.050
"No. Not exactly."

00:05:20.693 --> 00:05:22.732
Passion is your greatest love.

00:05:23.327 --> 00:05:25.581
Passion is the thing

00:05:25.605 --> 00:05:30.625
that will help you create
the highest expression of your talent.

00:05:30.649 --> 00:05:33.220
Passion, interest --
it's not the same thing.

00:05:33.244 --> 00:05:35.775
Are you really going to go
to your sweetie and say,

00:05:35.799 --> 00:05:38.658
"Marry me! You're interesting."

00:05:38.682 --> 00:05:41.792
(Laughter)

00:05:41.816 --> 00:05:43.752
Won't happen.

00:05:43.776 --> 00:05:45.870
Won't happen, and you will die alone.

00:05:45.894 --> 00:05:47.236
(Laughter)

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:48.545
What you want,

00:05:48.569 --> 00:05:51.077
what you want, what you want,

00:05:51.101 --> 00:05:52.489
is passion.

00:05:52.513 --> 00:05:54.323
It is beyond interest.

00:05:54.347 --> 00:05:57.973
You need 20 interests,
and then one of them,

00:05:57.997 --> 00:05:59.743
one of them might grab you,

00:05:59.767 --> 00:06:02.347
one of them might engage you
more than anything else,

00:06:02.371 --> 00:06:04.965
and then you may have found
your greatest love,

00:06:04.989 --> 00:06:09.180
in comparison to all the other things
that interest you,

00:06:09.204 --> 00:06:10.921
and that's what passion is.

00:06:10.945 --> 00:06:13.976
I have a friend, proposed to his sweetie.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.839
He was an economically rational person.

00:06:17.315 --> 00:06:19.909
He said to his sweetie, "Let us marry.

00:06:21.355 --> 00:06:23.601
Let us merge our interests."

00:06:23.625 --> 00:06:25.497
(Laughter)

00:06:25.521 --> 00:06:26.672
Yes, he did.

00:06:27.259 --> 00:06:30.990
"I love you truly," he said.
"I love you deeply.

00:06:31.014 --> 00:06:35.290
I love you more than any other woman
I've ever encountered.

00:06:35.314 --> 00:06:39.867
I love you more than Mary,
Jane, Susie, Penelope,

00:06:39.891 --> 00:06:41.907
Ingrid, Gertrude, Gretel --

00:06:41.931 --> 00:06:44.383
I was on a German exchange program then.

00:06:44.407 --> 00:06:47.446
I love you more than --"

00:06:47.470 --> 00:06:49.019
All right.

00:06:49.043 --> 00:06:50.424
She left the room

00:06:50.448 --> 00:06:55.016
halfway through his enumeration
of his love for her.

00:06:55.820 --> 00:06:59.952
After he got over his surprise
at being, you know, turned down,

00:06:59.976 --> 00:07:03.721
he concluded he'd had a narrow escape

00:07:03.745 --> 00:07:07.036
from marrying an irrational person.

00:07:07.512 --> 00:07:10.901
Although, he did make a note to himself
that the next time he proposed,

00:07:10.925 --> 00:07:12.584
it was perhaps not necessary

00:07:12.608 --> 00:07:17.767
to enumerate all of the women
he had auditioned for the part.

00:07:17.791 --> 00:07:19.882
(Laughter)

00:07:19.906 --> 00:07:21.346
But the point stands.

00:07:21.370 --> 00:07:25.011
You must look for alternatives
so that you find your destiny,

00:07:25.035 --> 00:07:27.670
or are you afraid of the word "destiny"?

00:07:27.694 --> 00:07:30.530
Does the word "destiny" scare you?

00:07:30.554 --> 00:07:32.116
That's what we're talking about.

00:07:32.140 --> 00:07:35.085
And if you don't find
the highest expression of your talent,

00:07:35.109 --> 00:07:38.283
if you settle for "interesting,"
what the hell ever that means,

00:07:38.307 --> 00:07:41.466
do you know what will happen
at the end of your long life?

00:07:41.490 --> 00:07:44.704
Your friends and family will be
gathered in the cemetery,

00:07:44.728 --> 00:07:48.220
and there beside your gravesite
will be a tombstone,

00:07:48.244 --> 00:07:49.846
and inscribed on that tombstone

00:07:49.870 --> 00:07:53.721
it will say, "Here lies
a distinguished engineer,

00:07:53.745 --> 00:07:55.545
who invented Velcro."

00:07:58.505 --> 00:08:02.474
But what that tombstone should have said,

00:08:02.498 --> 00:08:05.172
in an alternative lifetime,

00:08:05.196 --> 00:08:09.648
what it should have said if it was
your highest expression of talent,

00:08:09.672 --> 00:08:14.224
was, "Here lies the last
Nobel Laureate in Physics,

00:08:14.248 --> 00:08:17.589
who formulated
the Grand Unified Field Theory

00:08:17.613 --> 00:08:21.016
and demonstrated
the practicality of warp drive."

00:08:21.602 --> 00:08:23.781
(Laughter)

00:08:23.805 --> 00:08:25.552
Velcro, indeed!

00:08:25.576 --> 00:08:27.061
(Laughter)

00:08:28.686 --> 00:08:30.519
One was a great career.

00:08:31.694 --> 00:08:35.046
One was a missed opportunity.

00:08:35.652 --> 00:08:38.042
But then, there are some of you who,

00:08:38.066 --> 00:08:41.422
in spite of all these
excuses, you will find,

00:08:41.446 --> 00:08:43.461
you will find your passion.

00:08:44.997 --> 00:08:47.009
And you'll still fail.

00:08:48.176 --> 00:08:51.043
You're going to fail, because --

00:08:52.041 --> 00:08:54.619
because you're not going to do it,

00:08:54.643 --> 00:08:58.627
because you will have
invented a new excuse,

00:08:58.651 --> 00:09:02.428
any excuse to fail to take action,

00:09:02.452 --> 00:09:06.546
and this excuse, I've heard so many times:

00:09:06.570 --> 00:09:13.472
"Yes, I would pursue a great career,

00:09:13.496 --> 00:09:20.233
but, I value human relationships --

00:09:20.257 --> 00:09:21.258
(Laughter)

00:09:21.282 --> 00:09:22.790
more than accomplishment.

00:09:23.394 --> 00:09:25.752
I want to be a great friend.

00:09:25.776 --> 00:09:28.020
I want to be a great spouse.

00:09:28.044 --> 00:09:29.893
I want to be a great parent,

00:09:29.917 --> 00:09:32.036
and I will not sacrifice them

00:09:32.060 --> 00:09:35.050
on the altar of great accomplishment."

00:09:36.586 --> 00:09:37.703
(Laughter)

00:09:37.727 --> 00:09:39.227
What do you want me to say?

00:09:39.251 --> 00:09:42.013
Now, do you really want
me to say now, tell you,

00:09:42.037 --> 00:09:44.536
"Really, I swear I don't kick children."

00:09:44.560 --> 00:09:46.513
(Laughter)

00:09:47.227 --> 00:09:49.989
Look at the worldview
you've given yourself.

00:09:50.013 --> 00:09:52.074
You're a hero no matter what.

00:09:53.420 --> 00:09:56.222
And I, by suggesting ever so delicately

00:09:56.246 --> 00:09:59.420
that you might want a great career,
must hate children.

00:09:59.444 --> 00:10:01.453
I don't hate children. I don't kick them.

00:10:01.477 --> 00:10:04.372
Yes, there was a little kid
wandering through this building

00:10:04.396 --> 00:10:06.820
when I came here, and no,
I didn't kick him.

00:10:06.844 --> 00:10:08.287
(Laughter)

00:10:08.311 --> 00:10:11.423
Course, I had to tell him
the building was for adults only,

00:10:11.447 --> 00:10:13.049
and to get out.

00:10:13.073 --> 00:10:14.969
He mumbled something about his mother,

00:10:14.993 --> 00:10:18.517
and I told him she'd probably
find him outside anyway.

00:10:18.541 --> 00:10:21.225
Last time I saw him,
he was on the stairs crying.

00:10:21.249 --> 00:10:22.337
(Laughter)

00:10:22.361 --> 00:10:23.518
What a wimp.

00:10:23.542 --> 00:10:24.549
(Laughter)

00:10:24.573 --> 00:10:27.165
But what do you mean?
That's what you expect me to say.

00:10:27.189 --> 00:10:29.166
Do you really think it's appropriate

00:10:29.190 --> 00:10:35.803
that you should actually take
children and use them as a shield?

00:10:35.827 --> 00:10:38.041
You know what will happen someday,

00:10:38.065 --> 00:10:41.064
you ideal parent, you?

00:10:42.071 --> 00:10:45.088
The kid will come to you someday and say,

00:10:45.112 --> 00:10:47.524
"I know what I want to be.

00:10:47.548 --> 00:10:49.563
I know what I'm going to do with my life."

00:10:49.587 --> 00:10:50.762
You are so happy.

00:10:50.786 --> 00:10:53.008
It's the conversation
a parent wants to hear,

00:10:53.032 --> 00:10:54.889
because your kid's good in math,

00:10:54.913 --> 00:10:57.706
and you know you're going to like
what comes next.

00:10:57.730 --> 00:10:59.188
Says your kid,

00:10:59.212 --> 00:11:02.615
"I have decided I want to be a magician.

00:11:02.639 --> 00:11:05.760
I want to perform
magic tricks on the stage."

00:11:07.322 --> 00:11:08.759
(Laughter)

00:11:08.783 --> 00:11:10.347
And what do you say?

00:11:11.156 --> 00:11:13.631
You say, you say,

00:11:13.655 --> 00:11:16.978
"That's risky, kid.

00:11:17.002 --> 00:11:19.801
Might fail, kid. Don't make
a lot of money at that, kid.

00:11:19.825 --> 00:11:22.793
I don't know, kid, you should
think about that again, kid.

00:11:22.817 --> 00:11:24.792
You're so good at math, why don't you --"

00:11:24.816 --> 00:11:26.350
The kid interrupts you and says,

00:11:26.374 --> 00:11:29.722
"But it is my dream.
It is my dream to do this."

00:11:30.286 --> 00:11:32.311
And what are you going to say?

00:11:32.335 --> 00:11:33.977
You know what you're going to say?

00:11:34.001 --> 00:11:36.507
"Look kid. I had a dream once, too, but --

00:11:38.595 --> 00:11:39.769
But --"

00:11:39.793 --> 00:11:42.693
So how are you going to finish
the sentence with your "but"?

00:11:42.717 --> 00:11:47.998
"But. I had a dream too, once,
kid, but I was afraid to pursue it."

00:11:48.781 --> 00:11:51.360
Or are you going to tell him this:

00:11:51.384 --> 00:11:53.036
"I had a dream once, kid.

00:11:55.161 --> 00:11:56.703
But then, you were born."

00:11:56.727 --> 00:11:59.037
(Laughter)

00:11:59.061 --> 00:12:01.703
(Applause)

00:12:01.727 --> 00:12:06.774
Do you really want to use your family,

00:12:06.798 --> 00:12:11.345
do you really ever want to look
at your spouse and your kid,

00:12:11.369 --> 00:12:12.918
and see your jailers?

00:12:14.601 --> 00:12:18.212
There was something
you could have said to your kid,

00:12:18.236 --> 00:12:20.926
when he or she said, "I have a dream."

00:12:22.012 --> 00:12:23.948
You could have said --

00:12:23.972 --> 00:12:27.993
looked the kid in the face and said,

00:12:28.017 --> 00:12:29.799
"Go for it, kid!

00:12:31.162 --> 00:12:32.866
Just like I did."

00:12:34.580 --> 00:12:37.151
But you won't be able to say that,

00:12:37.175 --> 00:12:38.833
because you didn't.

00:12:38.857 --> 00:12:40.432
So you can't.

00:12:40.456 --> 00:12:42.421
(Laughter)

00:12:45.086 --> 00:12:48.253
And so the sins of the parents

00:12:48.277 --> 00:12:50.404
are visited on the poor children.

00:12:52.277 --> 00:12:57.800
Why will you seek refuge
in human relationships

00:12:57.824 --> 00:13:03.753
as your excuse not to find
and pursue your passion?

00:13:04.530 --> 00:13:05.815
You know why.

00:13:06.363 --> 00:13:08.879
In your heart of hearts, you know why,

00:13:08.903 --> 00:13:11.125
and I'm being deadly serious.

00:13:11.149 --> 00:13:13.837
You know why you would get
all warm and fuzzy

00:13:13.861 --> 00:13:16.756
and wrap yourself
up in human relationships.

00:13:17.543 --> 00:13:19.527
It is because you are --

00:13:20.969 --> 00:13:22.302
you know what you are.

00:13:22.761 --> 00:13:25.702
You're afraid to pursue your passion.

00:13:26.180 --> 00:13:28.212
You're afraid to look ridiculous.

00:13:28.236 --> 00:13:29.744
You're afraid to try.

00:13:29.768 --> 00:13:31.575
You're afraid you may fail.

00:13:35.043 --> 00:13:41.218
Great friend, great spouse,
great parent, great career.

00:13:42.083 --> 00:13:45.232
Is that not a package?
Is that not who you are?

00:13:46.253 --> 00:13:48.122
How can you be one without the other?

00:13:49.412 --> 00:13:51.031
But you're afraid.

00:13:52.166 --> 00:13:57.020
And that's why you're not
going to have a great career.

00:13:59.401 --> 00:14:01.768
Unless --

00:14:01.792 --> 00:14:06.979
"unless," that most evocative
of all English words --

00:14:07.003 --> 00:14:08.466
"unless."

00:14:09.371 --> 00:14:13.804
But the "unless" word is also attached

00:14:13.828 --> 00:14:18.780
to that other, most terrifying phrase,

00:14:18.804 --> 00:14:20.693
"If only I had ..."

00:14:21.463 --> 00:14:24.167
"If only I had ..."

00:14:24.191 --> 00:14:29.437
If you ever have that thought
ricocheting in your brain,

00:14:29.461 --> 00:14:31.818
it will hurt a lot.

00:14:33.007 --> 00:14:35.635
So, those are the many reasons

00:14:35.659 --> 00:14:37.635
why you are going to fail

00:14:37.659 --> 00:14:39.301
to have a great career.

00:14:41.198 --> 00:14:42.590
Unless --

00:14:46.698 --> 00:14:47.857
Unless.

00:14:49.912 --> 00:14:51.064
Thank you.

00:14:51.088 --> 00:14:54.025
(Applause)
