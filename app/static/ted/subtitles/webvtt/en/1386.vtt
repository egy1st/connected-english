00:00:15.448 --> 00:00:18.123
On a typical day at school,

00:00:18.147 --> 00:00:22.731
endless hours are spent learning
the answers to questions,

00:00:22.755 --> 00:00:25.051
but right now, we'll do the opposite.

00:00:26.384 --> 00:00:29.527
We're going to focus on questions
where you can't learn the answers

00:00:29.551 --> 00:00:30.976
because they're unknown.

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:36.638
I used to puzzle about a lot of things
as a boy, for example:

00:00:36.662 --> 00:00:39.077
What would it feel like to be a dog?

00:00:39.101 --> 00:00:40.976
Do fish feel pain?

00:00:41.412 --> 00:00:42.862
How about insects?

00:00:43.784 --> 00:00:46.648
Was the Big Bang just an accident?

00:00:47.607 --> 00:00:48.976
And is there a God?

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.533
And if so, how are we so sure
that it's a He and not a She?

00:00:53.557 --> 00:00:56.742
Why do so many innocent people
and animals suffer terrible things?

00:00:57.544 --> 00:00:59.464
Is there really a plan for my life?

00:01:00.596 --> 00:01:02.347
Is the future yet to be written,

00:01:02.371 --> 00:01:05.764
or is it already written
and we just can't see it?

00:01:05.788 --> 00:01:08.732
But then, do I have free will?
I mean, who am I anyway?

00:01:08.756 --> 00:01:10.280
Am I just a biological machine?

00:01:11.371 --> 00:01:14.656
But then, why am I conscious?
What is consciousness?

00:01:15.768 --> 00:01:17.705
Will robots become conscious one day?

00:01:19.291 --> 00:01:21.697
I mean, I kind of assumed that some day

00:01:21.721 --> 00:01:24.377
I would be told the answers
to all these questions.

00:01:25.557 --> 00:01:27.401
Someone must know, right?

00:01:28.517 --> 00:01:30.826
Guess what? No one knows.

00:01:32.167 --> 00:01:35.760
Most of those questions
puzzle me more now than ever.

00:01:35.784 --> 00:01:38.287
But diving into them is exciting

00:01:38.311 --> 00:01:40.594
because it takes you
to the edge of knowledge,

00:01:40.618 --> 00:01:42.618
and you never know what you'll find there.

00:01:43.921 --> 00:01:49.497
So, two questions that no one
on Earth knows the answer to.

00:01:50.704 --> 00:01:52.389
(Music)

00:01:52.413 --> 00:01:56.112
[How many universes are there?]

00:01:57.812 --> 00:01:59.976
Sometimes when I'm on a long plane flight,

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.868
I gaze out at all those
mountains and deserts

00:02:02.892 --> 00:02:05.594
and try to get my head
around how vast our Earth is.

00:02:06.608 --> 00:02:09.370
And then I remember
that there's an object we see every day

00:02:09.394 --> 00:02:12.992
that would literally fit
one million Earths inside it:

00:02:13.016 --> 00:02:14.032
the Sun.

00:02:14.056 --> 00:02:15.666
It seems impossibly big.

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:19.150
But in the great scheme
of things, it's a pinprick,

00:02:19.174 --> 00:02:23.118
one of about 400 billion stars
in the Milky Way galaxy,

00:02:23.142 --> 00:02:25.194
which you can see on a clear night

00:02:25.218 --> 00:02:27.361
as a pale white mist
stretched across the sky.

00:02:28.511 --> 00:02:29.610
And it gets worse.

00:02:29.634 --> 00:02:32.919
There are maybe 100 billion galaxies
detectable by our telescopes.

00:02:33.758 --> 00:02:38.037
So if each star was the size
of a single grain of sand,

00:02:38.061 --> 00:02:40.061
just the Milky Way has enough stars

00:02:40.085 --> 00:02:42.743
to fill a 30-foot by 30-foot
stretch of beach

00:02:42.767 --> 00:02:44.608
three feet deep with sand.

00:02:45.903 --> 00:02:48.605
And the entire Earth
doesn't have enough beaches

00:02:48.629 --> 00:02:51.239
to represent the stars
in the overall universe.

00:02:51.263 --> 00:02:54.814
Such a beach would continue for literally
hundreds of millions of miles.

00:02:55.791 --> 00:02:58.976
Holy Stephen Hawking,
that is a lot of stars.

00:02:59.968 --> 00:03:02.892
But he and other physicists
now believe in a reality

00:03:02.916 --> 00:03:05.099
that is unimaginably bigger still.

00:03:06.002 --> 00:03:08.184
I mean, first of all,
the 100 billion galaxies

00:03:08.208 --> 00:03:09.716
within range of our telescopes

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:12.329
are probably a minuscule
fraction of the total.

00:03:12.353 --> 00:03:16.355
Space itself is expanding
at an accelerating pace.

00:03:16.379 --> 00:03:18.758
The vast majority of the galaxies

00:03:18.782 --> 00:03:22.389
are separating from us so fast
that light from them may never reach us.

00:03:23.257 --> 00:03:25.981
Still, our physical reality here on Earth

00:03:26.005 --> 00:03:29.937
is intimately connected
to those distant, invisible galaxies.

00:03:29.961 --> 00:03:32.156
We can think of them
as part of our universe.

00:03:32.744 --> 00:03:34.976
They make up a single, giant edifice

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.460
obeying the same physical laws
and all made from the same types of atoms,

00:03:38.484 --> 00:03:42.021
electrons, protons, quarks, neutrinos,
that make up you and me.

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:46.969
However, recent theories in physics,
including one called string theory,

00:03:46.993 --> 00:03:49.976
are now telling us there could be
countless other universes

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:51.976
built on different types of particles,

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.381
with different properties,
obeying different laws.

00:03:54.928 --> 00:03:57.436
Most of these universes
could never support life,

00:03:57.460 --> 00:04:00.436
and might flash in and out
of existence in a nanosecond.

00:04:01.085 --> 00:04:04.560
But nonetheless, combined,
they make up a vast multiverse

00:04:04.584 --> 00:04:07.622
of possible universes
in up to 11 dimensions,

00:04:07.646 --> 00:04:11.380
featuring wonders
beyond our wildest imagination.

00:04:12.206 --> 00:04:15.079
The leading version of string theory
predicts a multiverse

00:04:15.103 --> 00:04:16.976
made up of 10 to the 500 universes.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.869
That's a one followed by 500 zeros,

00:04:20.892 --> 00:04:23.294
a number so vast that if every atom

00:04:23.318 --> 00:04:27.424
in our observable universe
had its own universe,

00:04:27.448 --> 00:04:29.877
and all of the atoms
in all those universes each had

00:04:29.901 --> 00:04:31.884
their own universe,

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.322
and you repeated that for two more cycles,

00:04:34.346 --> 00:04:37.747
you'd still be at a tiny
fraction of the total,

00:04:37.771 --> 00:04:41.248
namely, one trillion trillion trillion
trillion trillion trillion trillion

00:04:41.272 --> 00:04:46.008
trillion trillion trillion trillion
trillion trillion trillion trillionth.

00:04:46.421 --> 00:04:47.734
(Laughter)

00:04:47.758 --> 00:04:52.223
But even that number
is minuscule compared to another number:

00:04:53.012 --> 00:04:54.020
infinity.

00:04:54.488 --> 00:04:57.679
Some physicists think the space-time
continuum is literally infinite

00:04:57.703 --> 00:05:01.080
and that it contains an infinite number
of so-called pocket universes

00:05:01.104 --> 00:05:02.247
with varying properties.

00:05:03.107 --> 00:05:04.236
How's your brain doing?

00:05:05.061 --> 00:05:06.976
Quantum theory adds a whole new wrinkle.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.652
I mean, the theory's been proven
true beyond all doubt,

00:05:09.676 --> 00:05:11.885
but interpreting it is baffling,

00:05:11.909 --> 00:05:15.006
and some physicists think
you can only un-baffle it

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:17.632
if you imagine that huge numbers
of parallel universes

00:05:17.656 --> 00:05:20.237
are being spawned every moment,

00:05:20.261 --> 00:05:23.785
and many of these universes would actually
be very like the world we're in,

00:05:23.809 --> 00:05:25.961
would include multiple copies of you.

00:05:25.985 --> 00:05:28.491
In one such universe,
you'd graduate with honors

00:05:28.515 --> 00:05:32.567
and marry the person of your dreams,
and in another, not so much.

00:05:33.293 --> 00:05:36.277
Well, there are still some scientists
who would say, hogwash.

00:05:36.301 --> 00:05:40.206
The only meaningful answer to the question
of how many universes there are is one.

00:05:40.822 --> 00:05:41.976
Only one universe.

00:05:42.678 --> 00:05:45.876
And a few philosophers
and mystics might argue

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:48.549
that even our own universe is an illusion.

00:05:49.672 --> 00:05:51.053
So, as you can see, right now

00:05:51.077 --> 00:05:54.748
there is no agreement
on this question, not even close.

00:05:54.772 --> 00:05:58.259
All we know is the answer is somewhere
between zero and infinity.

00:05:59.173 --> 00:06:01.147
Well, I guess we know one other thing.

00:06:01.782 --> 00:06:04.976
This is a pretty cool time
to be studying physics.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.653
We just might be undergoing
the biggest paradigm shift in knowledge

00:06:08.677 --> 00:06:10.488
that humanity has ever seen.

00:06:10.512 --> 00:06:13.211
(Music)

00:06:14.609 --> 00:06:17.409
[Why can't we see evidence of alien life?]

00:06:17.704 --> 00:06:20.853
Somewhere out there in that vast universe

00:06:20.877 --> 00:06:23.937
there must surely be countless
other planets teeming with life.

00:06:23.961 --> 00:06:25.976
But why don't we see any evidence of it?

00:06:27.265 --> 00:06:30.265
Well, this is the famous question
asked by Enrico Fermi in 1950:

00:06:30.289 --> 00:06:31.767
Where is everybody?

00:06:33.006 --> 00:06:36.820
Conspiracy theorists claim that UFOs
are visiting all the time

00:06:36.844 --> 00:06:38.990
and the reports are just being covered up,

00:06:39.014 --> 00:06:41.858
but honestly, they aren't very convincing.

00:06:41.882 --> 00:06:43.311
But that leaves a real riddle.

00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:47.020
In the past year,
the Kepler space observatory

00:06:47.044 --> 00:06:49.925
has found hundreds of planets
just around nearby stars.

00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:52.311
And if you extrapolate that data,

00:06:52.335 --> 00:06:55.697
it looks like there could
be half a trillion planets

00:06:55.721 --> 00:06:57.086
just in our own galaxy.

00:06:58.267 --> 00:07:00.354
If any one in 10,000 has conditions

00:07:00.378 --> 00:07:02.976
that might support a form of life,

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.976
that's still 50 million possible
life-harboring planets

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:07.515
right here in the Milky Way.

00:07:08.551 --> 00:07:10.239
So here's the riddle:

00:07:10.263 --> 00:07:11.899
our Earth didn't form

00:07:11.923 --> 00:07:14.516
until about nine billion years
after the Big Bang.

00:07:15.685 --> 00:07:19.093
Countless other planets in our galaxy
should have formed earlier,

00:07:19.117 --> 00:07:21.435
and given life a chance to get underway

00:07:21.459 --> 00:07:26.260
billions, or certainly many millions
of years earlier than happened on Earth.

00:07:27.268 --> 00:07:29.977
If just a few of them
had spawned intelligent life

00:07:30.001 --> 00:07:32.545
and started creating technologies,

00:07:32.569 --> 00:07:35.809
those technologies would have
had millions of years

00:07:35.833 --> 00:07:37.837
to grow in complexity and power.

00:07:39.166 --> 00:07:40.745
On Earth,

00:07:40.769 --> 00:07:43.640
we've seen how dramatically
technology can accelerate

00:07:43.664 --> 00:07:45.025
in just 100 years.

00:07:46.407 --> 00:07:49.976
In millions of years,
an intelligent alien civilization

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.707
could easily have spread out
across the galaxy,

00:07:52.731 --> 00:07:56.114
perhaps creating giant
energy-harvesting artifacts

00:07:56.138 --> 00:07:58.539
or fleets of colonizing spaceships

00:07:59.104 --> 00:08:01.739
or glorious works of art
that fill the night sky.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.129
At the very least, you'd think
they'd be revealing their presence,

00:08:06.153 --> 00:08:07.483
deliberately or otherwise,

00:08:07.507 --> 00:08:10.460
through electromagnetic signals
of one kind or another.

00:08:11.271 --> 00:08:13.780
And yet we see no convincing
evidence of any of it.

00:08:13.804 --> 00:08:14.816
Why?

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:20.639
Well, there are numerous possible answers,
some of them quite dark.

00:08:21.331 --> 00:08:23.976
Maybe a single,
superintelligent civilization

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.101
has indeed taken over the galaxy

00:08:27.125 --> 00:08:29.647
and has imposed strict radio silence

00:08:29.671 --> 00:08:32.241
because it's paranoid
of any potential competitors.

00:08:32.926 --> 00:08:35.827
It's just sitting there
ready to obliterate

00:08:35.851 --> 00:08:37.568
anything that becomes a threat.

00:08:39.010 --> 00:08:40.976
Or maybe they're not that intelligent,

00:08:42.299 --> 00:08:44.951
or perhaps the evolution
of an intelligence

00:08:44.975 --> 00:08:47.023
capable of creating
sophisticated technology

00:08:47.047 --> 00:08:49.017
is far rarer than we've assumed.

00:08:49.041 --> 00:08:53.824
After all, it's only happened once
on Earth in four billion years.

00:08:53.848 --> 00:08:55.976
Maybe even that was incredibly lucky.

00:08:56.452 --> 00:08:59.579
Maybe we are the first
such civilization in our galaxy.

00:09:01.042 --> 00:09:06.500
Or, perhaps civilization carries with it
the seeds of its own destruction

00:09:06.524 --> 00:09:09.382
through the inability to control
the technologies it creates.

00:09:11.478 --> 00:09:13.600
But there are numerous
more hopeful answers.

00:09:13.624 --> 00:09:15.621
For a start, we're not looking that hard,

00:09:15.645 --> 00:09:18.026
and we're spending
a pitiful amount of money on it.

00:09:18.547 --> 00:09:21.847
Only a tiny fraction
of the stars in our galaxy

00:09:21.871 --> 00:09:25.062
have really been looked at closely
for signs of interesting signals.

00:09:26.144 --> 00:09:28.262
And perhaps we're not looking
the right way.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:30.976
Maybe as civilizations develop,

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.286
they quickly discover
communication technologies

00:09:33.310 --> 00:09:36.976
far more sophisticated and useful
than electromagnetic waves.

00:09:38.183 --> 00:09:41.483
Maybe all the action takes place
inside the mysterious

00:09:41.507 --> 00:09:43.524
recently discovered dark matter,

00:09:43.548 --> 00:09:47.337
or dark energy, that appear to account
for most of the universe's mass.

00:09:49.348 --> 00:09:51.976
Or, maybe we're looking
at the wrong scale.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.976
Perhaps intelligent
civilizations come to realize

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.810
that life is ultimately
just complex patterns of information

00:09:57.834 --> 00:10:00.038
interacting with each other
in a beautiful way,

00:10:00.062 --> 00:10:02.839
and that that can happen more
efficiently at a small scale.

00:10:03.379 --> 00:10:05.976
So, just as on Earth,
clunky stereo systems have shrunk

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.976
to beautiful, tiny iPods,
maybe intelligent life itself,

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.724
in order to reduce its footprint
on the environment,

00:10:11.748 --> 00:10:13.691
has turned itself microscopic.

00:10:13.715 --> 00:10:16.024
So the Solar System
might be teeming with aliens,

00:10:16.048 --> 00:10:17.653
and we're just not noticing them.

00:10:17.677 --> 00:10:20.676
Maybe the very ideas in our heads
are a form of alien life.

00:10:21.580 --> 00:10:24.250
Well, okay, that's a crazy thought.

00:10:24.274 --> 00:10:25.599
The aliens made me say it.

00:10:26.445 --> 00:10:30.223
But it is cool that ideas do seem
to have a life all of their own

00:10:30.247 --> 00:10:32.718
and that they outlive their creators.

00:10:33.724 --> 00:10:37.047
Maybe biological life
is just a passing phase.

00:10:39.459 --> 00:10:40.976
Well, within the next 15 years,

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.976
we could start seeing
real spectroscopic information

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:45.810
from promising nearby planets

00:10:45.834 --> 00:10:48.370
that will reveal just
how life-friendly they might be.

00:10:48.394 --> 00:10:51.976
And meanwhile, SETI, the Search
for Extraterrestrial Intelligence,

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:53.976
is now releasing its data to the public

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.976
so that millions of citizen scientists,
maybe including you,

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.477
can bring the power of the crowd
to join the search.

00:11:00.582 --> 00:11:02.596
And here on Earth, amazing experiments

00:11:02.620 --> 00:11:04.976
are being done to try
to create life from scratch,

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:08.694
life that might be very different
from the DNA forms we know.

00:11:09.320 --> 00:11:13.976
All of this will help us understand
whether the universe is teeming with life

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:17.828
or whether, indeed, it's just us.

00:11:19.823 --> 00:11:22.308
Either answer, in its own way,

00:11:22.332 --> 00:11:24.178
is awe-inspiring,

00:11:25.407 --> 00:11:26.976
because even if we are alone,

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:31.531
the fact that we think and dream
and ask these questions

00:11:31.555 --> 00:11:33.147
might yet turn out to be

00:11:33.171 --> 00:11:35.552
one of the most important facts
about the universe.

00:11:36.347 --> 00:11:39.081
And I have one more piece
of good news for you.

00:11:39.105 --> 00:11:41.931
The quest for knowledge
and understanding never gets dull.

00:11:41.955 --> 00:11:43.976
It doesn't. It's actually the opposite.

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:46.976
The more you know,
the more amazing the world seems.

00:11:47.758 --> 00:11:51.191
And it's the crazy possibilities,
the unanswered questions,

00:11:51.215 --> 00:11:52.452
that pull us forward.

00:11:52.476 --> 00:11:55.329
So stay curious.
