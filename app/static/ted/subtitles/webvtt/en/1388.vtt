00:00:14.489 --> 00:00:16.553
One of the funny things
about owning a brain

00:00:16.577 --> 00:00:18.585
is that you have
no control over the things

00:00:18.609 --> 00:00:21.346
that it gathers and holds onto,
the facts and the stories.

00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:23.416
And as you get older, it only gets worse.

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:25.637
Things stick around for years sometimes

00:00:25.661 --> 00:00:28.188
before you understand
why you're interested in them,

00:00:28.212 --> 00:00:30.297
before you understand their import to you.

00:00:30.321 --> 00:00:31.590
Here's three of mine.

00:00:31.614 --> 00:00:34.957
When Richard Feynman
was a young boy in Queens,

00:00:34.981 --> 00:00:38.306
he went for a walk with his dad
and his wagon and a ball.

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:42.187
He noticed that when he pulled the wagon,
the ball went to the back of the wagon.

00:00:42.211 --> 00:00:45.336
He asked his dad, "Why does
the ball go to the back of the wagon?"

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.031
And his dad said, "That's inertia."

00:00:47.055 --> 00:00:49.356
He said, "What's inertia?"
And his dad said, "Ah.

00:00:50.048 --> 00:00:51.976
Inertia is the name that scientists give

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.576
to the phenomenon of the ball
going to the back of the wagon."

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:57.254
(Laughter)

00:00:57.278 --> 00:00:59.709
"But in truth, nobody really knows."

00:01:00.543 --> 00:01:02.153
Feynman went on to earn degrees

00:01:02.177 --> 00:01:05.177
at MIT, Princeton, he solved
the Challenger disaster,

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:08.035
he ended up winning
the Nobel Prize in Physics

00:01:08.059 --> 00:01:11.547
for his Feynman diagrams, describing
the movement of subatomic particles.

00:01:12.204 --> 00:01:16.514
And he credits that conversation
with his father as giving him a sense

00:01:16.538 --> 00:01:21.073
that the simplest questions could carry
you out to the edge of human knowledge,

00:01:21.097 --> 00:01:23.002
and that that's where he wanted to play.

00:01:23.026 --> 00:01:24.399
And play he did.

00:01:25.543 --> 00:01:29.673
Eratosthenes was the third librarian
at the great Library of Alexandria,

00:01:29.697 --> 00:01:32.215
and he made many contributions to science.

00:01:32.239 --> 00:01:34.001
But the one he is most remembered for

00:01:34.025 --> 00:01:37.528
began in a letter that he received
as the librarian,

00:01:37.552 --> 00:01:41.139
from the town of Swenet,
which was south of Alexandria.

00:01:41.163 --> 00:01:44.116
The letter included this fact
that stuck in Eratosthenes' mind,

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:46.748
and the fact was that the writer said,

00:01:46.772 --> 00:01:49.637
at noon on the solstice,
when he looked down this deep well,

00:01:49.661 --> 00:01:51.715
he could see his reflection at the bottom,

00:01:51.739 --> 00:01:54.479
and he could also see
that his head was blocking the sun.

00:01:54.503 --> 00:01:57.112
I should tell you -- the idea
that Christopher Columbus

00:01:57.136 --> 00:01:59.699
discovered that the world
is spherical is total bull.

00:01:59.723 --> 00:02:00.724
It's not true at all.

00:02:00.748 --> 00:02:04.269
In fact, everyone who was educated
understood that the world was spherical

00:02:04.293 --> 00:02:05.429
since Aristotle's time.

00:02:05.453 --> 00:02:07.888
Aristotle had proved it
with a simple observation.

00:02:07.912 --> 00:02:11.092
He noticed that every time you saw
the Earth's shadow on the Moon,

00:02:11.116 --> 00:02:12.147
it was circular,

00:02:12.171 --> 00:02:15.061
and the only shape that constantly
creates a circular shadow

00:02:15.085 --> 00:02:17.993
is a sphere, Q.E.D. the Earth is round.

00:02:18.017 --> 00:02:19.807
But nobody knew how big it was

00:02:19.831 --> 00:02:23.183
until Eratosthenes got
this letter with this fact.

00:02:23.207 --> 00:02:26.736
So he understood that the sun
was directly above the city of Swenet,

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:29.866
because looking down a well,
it was a straight line

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:33.212
all the way down the well,
right past the guy's head up to the sun.

00:02:33.236 --> 00:02:34.950
Eratosthenes knew another fact.

00:02:34.974 --> 00:02:37.668
He knew that a stick stuck
in the ground in Alexandria

00:02:37.692 --> 00:02:40.747
at the same time
and the same day, at noon,

00:02:40.771 --> 00:02:42.607
the sun's zenith, on the solstice,

00:02:42.631 --> 00:02:48.442
the sun cast a shadow that showed
that it was 7.2 degrees off-axis.

00:02:49.763 --> 00:02:53.571
If you know the circumference of a circle,
and you have two points on it,

00:02:53.595 --> 00:02:56.563
all you need to know is the distance
between those two points,

00:02:56.587 --> 00:02:58.642
and you can extrapolate the circumference.

00:02:58.666 --> 00:03:02.131
360 degrees divided by 7.2 equals 50.

00:03:02.155 --> 00:03:04.248
I know it's a little bit
of a round number,

00:03:04.272 --> 00:03:06.383
and it makes me suspicious
of this story too,

00:03:06.407 --> 00:03:08.795
but it's a good story,
so we'll continue with it.

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:11.813
He needed to know the distance
between Swenet and Alexandria,

00:03:11.837 --> 00:03:15.120
which is good because Eratosthenes
was good at geography.

00:03:15.144 --> 00:03:17.842
In fact, he invented the word geography.

00:03:17.866 --> 00:03:19.088
(Laughter)

00:03:19.112 --> 00:03:22.355
The road between Swenet and Alexandria
was a road of commerce,

00:03:22.379 --> 00:03:25.341
and commerce needed to know
how long it took to get there.

00:03:25.365 --> 00:03:28.608
It needed to know the exact distance,
so he knew very precisely

00:03:28.632 --> 00:03:31.587
that the distance between
the two cities was 500 miles.

00:03:31.611 --> 00:03:33.976
Multiply that times 50, you get 25,000,

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.433
which is within one percent
of the actual diameter of the Earth.

00:03:38.025 --> 00:03:40.976
He did this 2,200 years ago.

00:03:42.302 --> 00:03:43.976
Now, we live in an age where

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.703
multi-billion-dollar pieces of machinery
are looking for the Higgs boson.

00:03:48.727 --> 00:03:50.039
We're discovering particles

00:03:50.063 --> 00:03:52.341
that may travel faster
than the speed of light,

00:03:52.365 --> 00:03:55.111
and all of these discoveries
are made possible

00:03:55.135 --> 00:03:58.744
by technology that's been developed
in the last few decades.

00:03:58.768 --> 00:04:01.248
But for most of human history,

00:04:01.272 --> 00:04:05.608
we had to discover these things using
our eyes and our ears and our minds.

00:04:06.439 --> 00:04:09.976
Armand Fizeau was
an experimental physicist in Paris.

00:04:10.803 --> 00:04:15.007
His specialty was actually refining
and confirming other people's results,

00:04:15.031 --> 00:04:17.372
and this might sound
like a bit of an also-ran,

00:04:17.396 --> 00:04:19.497
but in fact, this is the soul of science,

00:04:19.521 --> 00:04:23.426
because there is no such thing as a fact
that cannot be independently corroborated.

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:26.286
And he was familiar
with Galileo's experiments

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:29.497
in trying to determine
whether or not light had a speed.

00:04:29.521 --> 00:04:32.727
Galileo had worked out this
really wonderful experiment

00:04:32.751 --> 00:04:36.289
where he and his assistant had a lamp,
each one of them was holding a lamp.

00:04:36.313 --> 00:04:39.250
Galileo would open his lamp,
and his assistant would open his.

00:04:39.274 --> 00:04:41.076
They got the timing down really good.

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:42.571
They just knew their timing.

00:04:42.595 --> 00:04:44.657
And then they stood at two hilltops,

00:04:44.681 --> 00:04:47.104
two miles distant,
and they did the same thing,

00:04:47.128 --> 00:04:50.477
on the assumption from Galileo
that if light had a discernible speed,

00:04:50.501 --> 00:04:53.835
he'd notice a delay in the light
coming back from his assistant's lamp.

00:04:53.859 --> 00:04:56.019
But light was too fast for Galileo.

00:04:56.043 --> 00:04:58.912
He was off by several orders
of magnitude when he assumed

00:04:58.936 --> 00:05:01.976
that light was roughly ten times
as fast as the speed of sound.

00:05:02.873 --> 00:05:04.753
Fizeau was aware of this experiment.

00:05:04.777 --> 00:05:09.080
He lived in Paris, and he set up
two experimental stations,

00:05:09.104 --> 00:05:12.162
roughly 5.5 miles distant, in Paris.

00:05:12.186 --> 00:05:14.621
And he solved this problem of Galileo's,

00:05:14.645 --> 00:05:17.741
and he did it with a really relatively
trivial piece of equipment.

00:05:19.915 --> 00:05:21.555
He did it with one of these.

00:05:21.579 --> 00:05:23.722
I'm going to put away
the clicker for a second

00:05:23.746 --> 00:05:25.874
because I want to engage
your brains in this.

00:05:25.898 --> 00:05:27.308
So this is a toothed wheel.

00:05:27.332 --> 00:05:30.262
It's got a bunch of notches
and it's got a bunch of teeth.

00:05:30.286 --> 00:05:33.345
This was Fizeau's solution
to sending discrete pulses of light.

00:05:33.369 --> 00:05:35.875
He put a beam behind one of these notches.

00:05:35.899 --> 00:05:39.078
If I point a beam
through this notch at a mirror,

00:05:39.102 --> 00:05:41.881
five miles away, that beam
is bouncing off the mirror

00:05:41.905 --> 00:05:44.025
and coming back to me through this notch.

00:05:44.049 --> 00:05:47.206
But something interesting happens
as he spins the wheel faster.

00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:50.565
He notices that it seems
like a door is starting to close

00:05:50.589 --> 00:05:52.976
on the light beam
that's coming back to his eye.

00:05:53.968 --> 00:05:54.968
Why is that?

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:57.933
It's because the pulse
of light is not coming back

00:05:57.957 --> 00:05:59.244
through the same notch.

00:05:59.268 --> 00:06:00.751
It's actually hitting a tooth.

00:06:00.775 --> 00:06:05.057
And he spins the wheel fast enough
and he fully occludes the light.

00:06:05.081 --> 00:06:07.976
And then, based on the distance
between the two stations

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.143
and the speed of his wheel
and the number of notches in the wheel,

00:06:11.167 --> 00:06:15.414
he calculates the speed of light
to within two percent of its actual value.

00:06:16.329 --> 00:06:19.363
And he does this in 1849.

00:06:21.375 --> 00:06:23.614
This is what really gets me
going about science.

00:06:23.638 --> 00:06:26.067
Whenever I'm having trouble
understanding a concept,

00:06:26.091 --> 00:06:29.187
I go back and I research
the people that discovered that concept.

00:06:29.211 --> 00:06:31.944
I look at the story of how
they came to understand it.

00:06:31.968 --> 00:06:33.241
What happens when you look

00:06:33.265 --> 00:06:35.718
at what the discoverers
were thinking about

00:06:35.742 --> 00:06:37.377
when they made their discoveries,

00:06:37.401 --> 00:06:40.976
is you understand that
they are not so different from us.

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:45.752
We are all bags of meat and water.
We all start with the same tools.

00:06:46.421 --> 00:06:50.402
I love the idea that different branches
of science are called fields of study.

00:06:50.426 --> 00:06:53.741
Most people think of science
as a closed, black box,

00:06:53.765 --> 00:06:56.339
when in fact it is an open field.

00:06:56.363 --> 00:06:58.184
And we are all explorers.

00:06:58.208 --> 00:07:01.746
The people that made these discoveries
just thought a little bit harder

00:07:01.770 --> 00:07:05.388
about what they were looking at,
and they were a little bit more curious.

00:07:05.412 --> 00:07:08.597
And their curiosity changed the way
people thought about the world,

00:07:08.621 --> 00:07:10.408
and thus it changed the world.

00:07:10.432 --> 00:07:12.976
They changed the world, and so can you.

00:07:14.057 --> 00:07:15.149
Thank you.

00:07:15.173 --> 00:07:18.173
(Applause)
