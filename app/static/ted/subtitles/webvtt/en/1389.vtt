00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
I have a question for you:

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Are you religious?

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Please raise your hand right now

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
if you think of yourself as a religious person.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Let's see, I'd say about three or four percent.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
I had no idea there were so many believers at a TED Conference.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
(Laughter)

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Okay, here's another question:

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Do you think of yourself as spiritual

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
in any way, shape or form? Raise your hand.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Okay, that's the majority.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
My Talk today

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
is about the main reason, or one of the main reasons,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
why most people consider themselves

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
to be spiritual in some way, shape or form.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
My Talk today is about self-transcendence.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
It's just a basic fact about being human

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
that sometimes the self seems to just melt away.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
And when that happens,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
the feeling is ecstatic

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
and we reach for metaphors of up and down

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
to explain these feelings.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
We talk about being uplifted

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
or elevated.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
Now it's really hard to think about anything abstract like this

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
without a good concrete metaphor.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
So here's the metaphor I'm offering today.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
Think about the mind as being like a house with many rooms,

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
most of which we're very familiar with.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
But sometimes it's as though a doorway appears

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
from out of nowhere

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
and it opens onto a staircase.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
We climb the staircase

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000
and experience a state of altered consciousness.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
In 1902,

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
the great American psychologist William James

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
wrote about the many varieties of religious experience.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
He collected all kinds of case studies.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
He quoted the words of all kinds of people

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
who'd had a variety of these experiences.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
One of the most exciting to me

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
is this young man, Stephen Bradley,

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
had an encounter, he thought, with Jesus in 1820.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
And here's what Bradley said about it.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
(Music)

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
(Video) Stephen Bradley: I thought I saw the savior in human shape

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
for about one second in the room,

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
with arms extended,

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
appearing to say to me, "Come."

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
The next day I rejoiced with trembling.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
My happiness was so great that I said I wanted to die.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
This world had no place in my affections.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
Previous to this time,

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
I was very selfish and self-righteous.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000
But now I desired the welfare of all mankind

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
and could, with a feeling heart,

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000
forgive my worst enemies.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
JH: So note

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
how Bradley's petty, moralistic self

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
just dies on the way up the staircase.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
And on this higher level

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000
he becomes loving and forgiving.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000
The world's many religions have found so many ways

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
to help people climb the staircase.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
Some shut down the self using meditation.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
Others use psychedelic drugs.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.000
This is from a 16th century Aztec scroll

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000
showing a man about to eat a psilocybin mushroom

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.000
and at the same moment get yanked up the staircase by a god.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
Others use dancing, spinning and circling

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
to promote self-transcendence.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000
But you don't need a religion to get you through the staircase.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000
Lots of people find self-transcendence in nature.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000
Others overcome their self at raves.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000
But here's the weirdest place of all:

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
war.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
So many books about war say the same thing,

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
that nothing brings people together

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
like war.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000
And that bringing them together opens up the possibility

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000
of extraordinary self-transcendent experiences.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000
I'm going to play for you an excerpt

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
from this book by Glenn Gray.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.000
Gray was a soldier in the American army in World War II.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.000
And after the war he interviewed a lot of other soldiers

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000
and wrote about the experience of men in battle.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000
Here's a key passage

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.000
where he basically describes the staircase.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000
(Video) Glenn Gray: Many veterans will admit

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.000
that the experience of communal effort in battle

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000
has been the high point of their lives.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
"I" passes insensibly into a "we,"

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
"my" becomes "our"

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
and individual faith

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.000
loses its central importance.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000
I believe that it is nothing less

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000
than the assurance of immortality

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000
that makes self-sacrifice at these moments

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000
so relatively easy.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000
I may fall, but I do not die,

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.000
for that which is real in me goes forward

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000
and lives on in the comrades

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.000
for whom I gave up my life.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000
JH: So what all of these cases have in common

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000
is that the self seems to thin out, or melt away,

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000
and it feels good, it feels really good,

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.000
in a way totally unlike anything we feel in our normal lives.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.000
It feels somehow uplifting.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.000
This idea that we move up was central in the writing

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.000
of the great French sociologist Emile Durkheim.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000
Durkheim even called us Homo duplex,

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000
or two-level man.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000
The lower level he called the level of the profane.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000
Now profane is the opposite of sacred.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000
It just means ordinary or common.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.000
And in our ordinary lives we exist as individuals.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.000
We want to satisfy our individual desires.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000
We pursue our individual goals.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000
But sometimes something happens

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000
that triggers a phase change.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000
Individuals unite

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.000
into a team, a movement or a nation,

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.000
which is far more than the sum of its parts.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.000
Durkheim called this level the level of the sacred

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000
because he believed that the function of religion

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000
was to unite people into a group,

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.000
into a moral community.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.000
Durkheim believed that anything that unites us

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.000
takes on an air of sacredness.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000
And once people circle around

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.000
some sacred object or value,

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.000
they'll then work as a team and fight to defend it.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000
Durkheim wrote

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000
about a set of intense collective emotions

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.000
that accomplish this miracle of E pluribus unum,

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000
of making a group out of individuals.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.000
Think of the collective joy in Britain

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.000
on the day World War II ended.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.000
Think of the collective anger in Tahrir Square,

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.000
which brought down a dictator.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.000
And think of the collective grief

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.000
in the United States

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.000
that we all felt, that brought us all together,

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.000
after 9/11.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.000
So let me summarize where we are.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000
I'm saying that the capacity for self-transcendence

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.000
is just a basic part of being human.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000
I'm offering the metaphor

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000
of a staircase in the mind.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000
I'm saying we are Homo duplex

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.000
and this staircase takes us up from the profane level

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000
to the level of the sacred.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.000
When we climb that staircase,

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.000
self-interest fades away,

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.000
we become just much less self-interested,

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000
and we feel as though we are better, nobler

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.000
and somehow uplifted.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.000
So here's the million-dollar question

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000
for social scientists like me:

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000
Is the staircase

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:52.000
a feature of our evolutionary design?

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:55.000
Is it a product of natural selection,

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.000
like our hands?

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.000
Or is it a bug, a mistake in the system --

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000
this religious stuff is just something

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.000
that happens when the wires cross in the brain --

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.000
Jill has a stroke and she has this religious experience,

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000
it's just a mistake?

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:13.000
Well many scientists who study religion take this view.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000
The New Atheists, for example,

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.000
argue that religion is a set of memes,

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.000
sort of parasitic memes,

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.000
that get inside our minds

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.000
and make us do all kinds of crazy religious stuff,

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.000
self-destructive stuff, like suicide bombing.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.000
And after all,

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000
how could it ever be good for us

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000
to lose ourselves?

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.000
How could it ever be adaptive

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000
for any organism

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.000
to overcome self-interest?

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.000
Well let me show you.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.000
In "The Descent of Man,"

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.000
Charles Darwin wrote a great deal

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.000
about the evolution of morality --

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:50.000
where did it come from, why do we have it.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000
Darwin noted that many of our virtues

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000
are of very little use to ourselves,

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.000
but they're of great use to our groups.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.000
He wrote about the scenario

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000
in which two tribes of early humans

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000
would have come in contact and competition.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:05.000
He said, "If the one tribe included

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.000
a great number of courageous, sympathetic

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.000
and faithful members

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.000
who are always ready to aid and defend each other,

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.000
this tribe would succeed better

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.000
and conquer the other."

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.000
He went on to say that "Selfish and contentious people

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.000
will not cohere,

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.000
and without coherence

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.000
nothing can be effected."

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.000
In other words,

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.000
Charles Darwin believed

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.000
in group selection.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:32.000
Now this idea has been very controversial for the last 40 years,

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:35.000
but it's about to make a major comeback this year,

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:38.000
especially after E.O. Wilson's book comes out in April,

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.000
making a very strong case

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000
that we, and several other species,

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.000
are products of group selection.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000
But really the way to think about this

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.000
is as multilevel selection.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000
So look at it this way:

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:53.000
You've got competition going on within groups and across groups.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:56.000
So here's a group of guys on a college crew team.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.000
Within this team

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.000
there's competition.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000
There are guys competing with each other.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:05.000
The slowest rowers, the weakest rowers, are going to get cut from the team.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.000
And only a few of these guys are going to go on in the sport.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:10.000
Maybe one of them will make it to the Olympics.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.000
So within the team,

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.000
their interests are actually pitted against each other.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.000
And sometimes it would be advantageous

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.000
for one of these guys

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.000
to try to sabotage the other guys.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.000
Maybe he'll badmouth his chief rival

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.000
to the coach.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.000
But while that competition is going on

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.000
within the boat,

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:32.000
this competition is going on across boats.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:35.000
And once you put these guys in a boat competing with another boat,

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.000
now they've got no choice but to cooperate

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:40.000
because they're all in the same boat.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.000
They can only win

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:44.000
if they all pull together as a team.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.000
I mean, these things sound trite,

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.000
but they are deep evolutionary truths.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.000
The main argument against group selection

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.000
has always been

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:55.000
that, well sure, it would be nice to have a group of cooperators,

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.000
but as soon as you have a group of cooperators,

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:00.000
they're just going to get taken over by free-riders,

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.000
individuals that are going to exploit the hard work of the others.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.000
Let me illustrate this for you.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:08.000
Suppose we've got a group of little organisms --

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:11.000
they can be bacteria, they can be hamsters; it doesn't matter what --

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:14.000
and let's suppose that this little group here, they evolved to be cooperative.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.000
Well that's great. They graze, they defend each other,

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:19.000
they work together, they generate wealth.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.000
And as you'll see in this simulation,

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:24.000
as they interact they gain points, as it were, they grow,

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.000
and when they've doubled in size, you'll see them split,

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.000
and that's how they reproduce and the population grows.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:31.000
But suppose then that one of them mutates.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:33.000
There's a mutation in the gene

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.000
and one of them mutates to follow a selfish strategy.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.000
It takes advantage of the others.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:40.000
And so when a green interacts with a blue,

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.000
you'll see the green gets larger and the blue gets smaller.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.000
So here's how things play out.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.000
We start with just one green,

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.000
and as it interacts

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:51.000
it gains wealth or points or food.

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:54.000
And in short order, the cooperators are done for.

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:57.000
The free-riders have taken over.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:00.000
If a group cannot solve the free-rider problem

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:03.000
then it cannot reap the benefits of cooperation

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:06.000
and group selection cannot get started.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.000
But there are solutions to the free-rider problem.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.000
It's not that hard a problem.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:13.000
In fact, nature has solved it many, many times.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.000
And nature's favorite solution

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:18.000
is to put everyone in the same boat.

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.000
For example,

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:23.000
why is it that the mitochondria in every cell

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.000
has its own DNA,

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:28.000
totally separate from the DNA in the nucleus?

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.000
It's because they used to be

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.000
separate free-living bacteria

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.000
and they came together

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.000
and became a superorganism.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:39.000
Somehow or other -- maybe one swallowed another; we'll never know exactly why --

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.000
but once they got a membrane around them,

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:43.000
they were all in the same membrane,

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:46.000
now all the wealth-created division of labor,

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.000
all the greatness created by cooperation,

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.000
stays locked inside the membrane

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:53.000
and we've got a superorganism.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.000
And now let's rerun the simulation

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:57.000
putting one of these superorganisms

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:00.000
into a population of free-riders, of defectors, of cheaters

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:03.000
and look what happens.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:05.000
A superorganism can basically take what it wants.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:08.000
It's so big and powerful and efficient

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.000
that it can take resources

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:14.000
from the greens, from the defectors, the cheaters.

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.000
And pretty soon the whole population

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:19.000
is actually composed of these new superorganisms.

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:21.000
What I've shown you here

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:23.000
is sometimes called a major transition

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:26.000
in evolutionary history.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.000
Darwin's laws don't change,

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:31.000
but now there's a new kind of player on the field

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:34.000
and things begin to look very different.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.000
Now this transition was not a one-time freak of nature

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.000
that just happened with some bacteria.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.000
It happened again

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:42.000
about 120 or a 140 million years ago

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:45.000
when some solitary wasps

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:47.000
began creating little simple, primitive

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:50.000
nests, or hives.

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:53.000
Once several wasps were all together in the same hive,

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.000
they had no choice but to cooperate,

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.000
because pretty soon they were locked into competition

00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:59.000
with other hives.

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.000
And the most cohesive hives won,

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:03.000
just as Darwin said.

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:05.000
These early wasps

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:07.000
gave rise to the bees and the ants

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:09.000
that have covered the world

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:11.000
and changed the biosphere.

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:13.000
And it happened again,

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:15.000
even more spectacularly,

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:17.000
in the last half-million years

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:19.000
when our own ancestors

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:21.000
became cultural creatures,

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:24.000
they came together around a hearth or a campfire,

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.000
they divided labor,

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:29.000
they began painting their bodies, they spoke their own dialects,

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:32.000
and eventually they worshiped their own gods.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.000
Once they were all in the same tribe,

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:37.000
they could keep the benefits of cooperation locked inside.

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:39.000
And they unlocked the most powerful force

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:41.000
ever known on this planet,

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:43.000
which is human cooperation --

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:45.000
a force for construction

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:48.000
and destruction.

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.000
Of course, human groups are nowhere near as cohesive

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.000
as beehives.

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:55.000
Human groups may look like hives for brief moments,

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.000
but they tend to then break apart.

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:00.000
We're not locked into cooperation the way bees and ants are.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.000
In fact, often,

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.000
as we've seen happen in a lot of the Arab Spring revolts,

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:08.000
often those divisions are along religious lines.

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:11.000
Nonetheless, when people do come together

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:13.000
and put themselves all into the same movement,

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:16.000
they can move mountains.

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:19.000
Look at the people in these photos I've been showing you.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:21.000
Do you think they're there

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:23.000
pursuing their self-interest?

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:26.000
Or are they pursuing communal interest,

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:29.000
which requires them to lose themselves

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:33.000
and become simply a part of a whole?

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:36.000
Okay, so that was my Talk

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:38.000
delivered in the standard TED way.

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:40.000
And now I'm going to give the whole Talk over again

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.000
in three minutes

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:45.000
in a more full-spectrum sort of way.

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:47.000
(Music)

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:49.000
(Video) Jonathan Haidt: We humans have many varieties

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:51.000
of religious experience,

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:53.000
as William James explained.

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:56.000
One of the most common is climbing the secret staircase

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:58.000
and losing ourselves.

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:00.000
The staircase takes us

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:03.000
from the experience of life as profane or ordinary

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:05.000
upwards to the experience of life as sacred,

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:07.000
or deeply interconnected.

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:09.000
We are Homo duplex,

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:11.000
as Durkheim explained.

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:13.000
And we are Homo duplex

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:15.000
because we evolved by multilevel selection,

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:18.000
as Darwin explained.

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.000
I can't be certain if the staircase is an adaptation

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:22.000
rather than a bug,

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:24.000
but if it is an adaptation,

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:26.000
then the implications are profound.

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:28.000
If it is an adaptation,

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:31.000
then we evolved to be religious.

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:33.000
I don't mean that we evolved

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:35.000
to join gigantic organized religions.

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:37.000
Those things came along too recently.

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:39.000
I mean that we evolved

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:41.000
to see sacredness all around us

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:43.000
and to join with others into teams

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:45.000
and circle around sacred objects,

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:47.000
people and ideas.

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:50.000
This is why politics is so tribal.

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:53.000
Politics is partly profane, it's partly about self-interest,

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:56.000
but politics is also about sacredness.

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:58.000
It's about joining with others

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:00.000
to pursue moral ideas.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:03.000
It's about the eternal struggle between good and evil,

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:06.000
and we all believe we're on the good team.

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:08.000
And most importantly,

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:10.000
if the staircase is real,

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:12.000
it explains the persistent undercurrent

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:14.000
of dissatisfaction in modern life.

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:17.000
Because human beings are, to some extent,

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:19.000
hivish creatures like bees.

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:22.000
We're bees. We busted out of the hive during the Enlightenment.

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:25.000
We broke down the old institutions

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:27.000
and brought liberty to the oppressed.

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:29.000
We unleashed Earth-changing creativity

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:32.000
and generated vast wealth and comfort.

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:34.000
Nowadays we fly around

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:36.000
like individual bees exulting in our freedom.

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:38.000
But sometimes we wonder:

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:40.000
Is this all there is?

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:42.000
What should I do with my life?

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:44.000
What's missing?

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:46.000
What's missing is that we are Homo duplex,

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:49.000
but modern, secular society was built

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:52.000
to satisfy our lower, profane selves.

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:55.000
It's really comfortable down here on the lower level.

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:58.000
Come, have a seat in my home entertainment center.

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:00.000
One great challenge of modern life

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:03.000
is to find the staircase amid all the clutter

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:06.000
and then to do something good and noble

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:09.000
once you climb to the top.

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:12.000
I see this desire in my students at the University of Virginia.

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:14.000
They all want to find a cause or calling

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:16.000
that they can throw themselves into.

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:19.000
They're all searching for their staircase.

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:21.000
And that gives me hope

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:23.000
because people are not purely selfish.

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:25.000
Most people long to overcome pettiness

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:27.000
and become part of something larger.

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:30.000
And this explains the extraordinary resonance

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:32.000
of this simple metaphor

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:35.000
conjured up nearly 400 years ago.

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:37.000
"No man is an island

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:39.000
entire of itself.

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:42.000
Every man is a piece of the continent,

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:45.000
a part of the main."

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:47.000
JH: Thank you.

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:55.000
(Applause)
