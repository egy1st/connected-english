00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
The recent debate over copyright laws

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
like SOPA in the United States

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
and the ACTA agreement in Europe

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
has been very emotional.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
And I think some dispassionate, quantitative reasoning

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
could really bring a great deal to the debate.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
I'd therefore like to propose

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
that we employ, we enlist,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
the cutting edge field of copyright math

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
whenever we approach this subject.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
For instance, just recently

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
the Motion Picture Association revealed

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
that our economy loses 58 billion dollars a year

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
to copyright theft.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Now rather than just argue about this number,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
a copyright mathematician will analyze it

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
and he'll soon discover that this money

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
could stretch from this auditorium

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
all the way across Ocean Boulevard

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
to the Westin, and then to Mars ...

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
(Laughter)

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
... if we use pennies.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
Now this is obviously a powerful,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
some might say dangerously powerful, insight.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
But it's also a morally important one.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
Because this isn't just the hypothetical retail value

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
of some pirated movies that we're talking about,

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
but this is actual economic losses.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
This is the equivalent

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
to the entire American corn crop failing

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
along with all of our fruit crops,

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
as well as wheat, tobacco,

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
rice, sorghum --

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.000
whatever sorghum is -- losing sorghum.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
But identifying the actual losses to the economy

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
is almost impossible to do

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
unless we use copyright math.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
Now music revenues are down by about eight billion dollars a year

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
since Napster first came on the scene.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
So that's a chunk of what we're looking for.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
But total movie revenues

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
across theaters, home video and pay-per-view are up.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
And TV, satellite and cable revenues are way up.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
Other content markets like book publishing and radio

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
are also up.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
So this small missing chunk here

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
is puzzling.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000
(Laughter)

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
(Applause)

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
Since the big content markets

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
have grown in line with historic norms,

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
it's not additional growth that piracy has prevented,

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
but copyright math tells us

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
it must therefore be foregone growth

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
in a market that has no historic norms --

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
one that didn't exist in the 90's.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
What we're looking at here

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
is the insidious cost of ringtone piracy.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.000
(Laughter)

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
50 billion dollars of it a year,

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
which is enough, at 30 seconds a ringtone,

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
that could stretch from here

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
to Neanderthal times.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.000
(Laughter)

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
It's true.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
(Applause)

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
I have Excel.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
(Laughter)

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
The movie folks also tell us

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
that our economy loses

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000
over 370,000 jobs to content theft,

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000
which is quite a lot when you consider that, back in '98,

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
the Bureau of Labor Statistics indicated

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
that the motion picture and video industries

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000
were employing 270,000 people.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000
Other data has the music industry at about 45,000 people.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
And so the job losses that came with the Internet

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000
and all that content theft,

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000
have therefore left us with negative employment in our content industries.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
And this is just one of the many mind-blowing statistics

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
that copyright mathematicians have to deal with every day.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000
And some people think that string theory is tough.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
(Laughter)

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000
Now this is a key number from the copyright mathematicians' toolkit.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
It's the precise amount of harm

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000
that comes to media companies

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000
whenever a single copyrighted song or movie

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
gets pirated.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
Hollywood and Congress derived this number mathematically

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000
back when they last sat down to improve copyright damages

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000
and made this law.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000
Some people think this number's a little bit large,

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.000
but copyright mathematicians who are media lobby experts

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000
are merely surprised

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000
that it doesn't get compounded for inflation every year.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000
Now when this law first passed,

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.000
the world's hottest MP3 player could hold just 10 songs.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000
And it was a big Christmas hit.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000
Because what little hoodlum wouldn't want

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000
a million and a half bucks-worth of stolen goods in his pocket.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.000
(Laughter)

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:04.000
(Applause)

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.000
These days an iPod Classic can hold 40,000 songs,

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.000
which is to say eight billion dollars-worth

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000
of stolen media.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000
(Applause)

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000
Or about 75,000 jobs.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000
(Laughter)

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:23.000
(Applause)

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.000
Now you might find copyright math strange,

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
but that's because it's a field

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
that's best left to experts.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
So that's it for now.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000
I hope you'll join me next time

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.000
when I will be making an equally scientific and fact-based inquiry

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.000
into the cost of alien music piracy to he American economy.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000
Thank you very much.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000
(Applause)

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000
Thank you.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.000
(Applause)
