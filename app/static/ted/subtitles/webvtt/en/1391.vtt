00:00:02.048 --> 00:00:05.277
I'm going to tell you a little bit
about my TEDxHouston Talk.

00:00:05.841 --> 00:00:08.214
I woke up the morning
after I gave that talk

00:00:09.404 --> 00:00:13.562
with the worst vulnerability
hangover of my life.

00:00:14.346 --> 00:00:18.441
And I actually didn't leave my house
for about three days.

00:00:20.092 --> 00:00:23.319
The first time I left
was to meet a friend for lunch.

00:00:23.787 --> 00:00:26.209
And when I walked in,
she was already at the table.

00:00:26.233 --> 00:00:28.726
I sat down, and she said,
"God, you look like hell."

00:00:29.541 --> 00:00:32.516
I said, "Thanks. I feel really --

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:34.128
I'm not functioning."

00:00:34.152 --> 00:00:36.326
And she said, "What's going on?"

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:41.943
And I said, "I just told 500 people

00:00:41.967 --> 00:00:44.976
that I became a researcher
to avoid vulnerability.

00:00:45.586 --> 00:00:50.042
And that when being vulnerable
emerged from my data,

00:00:50.066 --> 00:00:54.645
as absolutely essential
to whole-hearted living,

00:00:54.669 --> 00:00:57.976
I told these 500 people
that I had a breakdown.

00:00:58.716 --> 00:01:00.478
I had a slide that said 'Breakdown.'

00:01:00.502 --> 00:01:02.976
At what point did I think
that was a good idea?"

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.121
(Laughter)

00:01:06.145 --> 00:01:08.303
And she said, "I saw
your talk live-streamed.

00:01:08.327 --> 00:01:10.619
It was not really you.

00:01:10.643 --> 00:01:13.025
It was a little different
than what you usually do.

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:14.092
But it was great."

00:01:14.885 --> 00:01:16.377
And I said,

00:01:16.401 --> 00:01:17.976
"This can't happen.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.741
YouTube, they're putting
this thing on YouTube.

00:01:20.765 --> 00:01:24.373
And we're going to be talking
about 600, 700 people."

00:01:24.936 --> 00:01:28.722
(Laughter)

00:01:28.746 --> 00:01:31.873
And she said,
"Well, I think it's too late."

00:01:31.897 --> 00:01:34.177
And I said, "Let me ask you something."

00:01:34.201 --> 00:01:35.653
And she said, "Yeah."

00:01:35.677 --> 00:01:37.970
I said, "Do you remember
when we were in college,

00:01:37.994 --> 00:01:40.035
really wild and kind of dumb?"

00:01:40.059 --> 00:01:41.065
She said, "Yeah."

00:01:41.089 --> 00:01:43.715
I said, "Remember when
we'd leave a really bad message

00:01:43.739 --> 00:01:45.715
on our ex-boyfriend's answering machine?

00:01:46.137 --> 00:01:49.745
Then we'd have to break into his dorm room
and then erase the tape?"

00:01:49.769 --> 00:01:52.166
(Laughter)

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:54.896
And she goes, "Uh... no."

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:57.130
(Laughter)

00:01:57.154 --> 00:01:59.780
Of course, the only thing
I could say at that point was,

00:01:59.804 --> 00:02:01.188
"Yeah, me neither.

00:02:02.133 --> 00:02:04.825
Yeah -- me neither."

00:02:04.849 --> 00:02:07.166
And I'm thinking to myself,

00:02:08.158 --> 00:02:09.976
"BrenÃ©, what are you doing?

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.225
Why did you bring this up?

00:02:12.249 --> 00:02:13.850
Have you lost your mind?

00:02:13.874 --> 00:02:16.159
Your sisters would be perfect for this."

00:02:16.183 --> 00:02:17.588
(Laughter)

00:02:17.612 --> 00:02:20.742
So I looked back up and she said,

00:02:20.766 --> 00:02:25.520
"Are you really going to try
to break in and steal the video

00:02:25.544 --> 00:02:27.120
before they put it on YouTube?"

00:02:27.144 --> 00:02:28.632
(Laughter)

00:02:28.656 --> 00:02:31.616
And I said, "I'm just thinking
about it a little bit."

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:33.402
(Laughter)

00:02:33.426 --> 00:02:37.979
She said, "You're like the worst
vulnerability role model ever."

00:02:38.003 --> 00:02:39.976
(Laughter)

00:02:40.937 --> 00:02:42.905
Then I looked at her and I said something

00:02:42.929 --> 00:02:44.857
that at the time felt a little dramatic,

00:02:44.881 --> 00:02:47.293
but ended up being
more prophetic than dramatic.

00:02:48.793 --> 00:02:52.738
"If 500 turns into 1,000

00:02:52.762 --> 00:02:54.222
or 2,000,

00:02:54.246 --> 00:02:55.976
my life is over."

00:02:56.594 --> 00:02:58.832
(Laughter)

00:02:58.856 --> 00:03:01.317
I had no contingency plan
for four million.

00:03:01.341 --> 00:03:04.000
(Laughter)

00:03:05.883 --> 00:03:08.271
And my life did end when that happened.

00:03:08.875 --> 00:03:11.976
And maybe the hardest part
about my life ending

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.947
is that I learned something
hard about myself,

00:03:16.971 --> 00:03:19.415
and that was that,

00:03:19.439 --> 00:03:20.976
as much as I would be frustrated

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.524
about not being able to get
my work out to the world,

00:03:23.548 --> 00:03:25.976
there was a part of me
that was working very hard

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.536
to engineer staying small,

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:31.386
staying right under the radar.

00:03:33.761 --> 00:03:35.894
But I want to talk
about what I've learned.

00:03:35.918 --> 00:03:38.721
There's two things
that I've learned in the last year.

00:03:39.287 --> 00:03:40.465
The first is:

00:03:42.468 --> 00:03:45.747
vulnerability is not weakness.

00:03:47.295 --> 00:03:51.481
And that myth is profoundly dangerous.

00:03:52.283 --> 00:03:54.005
Let me ask you honestly --

00:03:54.029 --> 00:03:55.837
and I'll give you this warning,

00:03:55.861 --> 00:03:57.147
I'm trained as a therapist,

00:03:57.171 --> 00:03:59.976
so I can out-wait you uncomfortably --

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.445
so if you could just raise your hand
that would be awesome --

00:04:03.469 --> 00:04:04.976
how many of you honestly,

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.834
when you're thinking about doing
or saying something vulnerable

00:04:08.858 --> 00:04:11.287
think, "God, vulnerability is weakness."

00:04:11.311 --> 00:04:14.359
How many of you think of vulnerability
and weakness synonymously?

00:04:15.319 --> 00:04:16.581
The majority of people.

00:04:17.136 --> 00:04:18.751
Now let me ask you this question:

00:04:18.775 --> 00:04:21.350
This past week at TED,

00:04:21.374 --> 00:04:23.976
how many of you,
when you saw vulnerability up here,

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.708
thought it was pure courage?

00:04:28.708 --> 00:04:30.628
Vulnerability is not weakness.

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:36.210
I define vulnerability as emotional risk,

00:04:36.234 --> 00:04:38.512
exposure, uncertainty.

00:04:39.425 --> 00:04:41.242
It fuels our daily lives.

00:04:41.611 --> 00:04:43.159
And I've come to the belief --

00:04:43.183 --> 00:04:45.428
this is my 12th year
doing this research --

00:04:45.452 --> 00:04:51.954
that vulnerability is our most accurate
measurement of courage --

00:04:53.929 --> 00:04:56.437
to be vulnerable,
to let ourselves be seen,

00:04:56.461 --> 00:04:57.532
to be honest.

00:04:58.663 --> 00:05:02.318
One of the weird things that's happened
is, after the TED explosion,

00:05:02.342 --> 00:05:05.975
I got a lot of offers to speak
all over the country --

00:05:05.999 --> 00:05:08.361
everyone from schools and parent meetings

00:05:08.385 --> 00:05:10.337
to Fortune 500 companies.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.417
And so many of the calls went like this,

00:05:13.441 --> 00:05:15.191
"Dr. Brown, we loved your TED talk.

00:05:15.215 --> 00:05:17.076
We'd like you to come in and speak.

00:05:17.557 --> 00:05:18.976
We'd appreciate it

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.332
if you wouldn't mention
vulnerability or shame."

00:05:21.356 --> 00:05:25.970
(Laughter)

00:05:26.739 --> 00:05:28.843
What would you like for me to talk about?

00:05:30.089 --> 00:05:31.493
There's three big answers.

00:05:31.517 --> 00:05:34.643
This is mostly, to be honest with you,
from the business sector:

00:05:34.667 --> 00:05:38.045
innovation, creativity and change.

00:05:38.482 --> 00:05:40.490
(Laughter)

00:05:40.514 --> 00:05:44.434
So let me go on the record and say,

00:05:44.458 --> 00:05:49.628
vulnerability is the birthplace
of innovation, creativity and change.

00:05:49.652 --> 00:05:55.191
(Applause)

00:05:57.855 --> 00:06:02.045
To create is to make something
that has never existed before.

00:06:03.704 --> 00:06:05.976
There's nothing more vulnerable than that.

00:06:06.681 --> 00:06:09.976
Adaptability to change
is all about vulnerability.

00:06:11.466 --> 00:06:12.555
The second thing,

00:06:12.579 --> 00:06:16.385
in addition to really
finally understanding

00:06:16.409 --> 00:06:18.812
the relationship between
vulnerability and courage,

00:06:18.836 --> 00:06:20.701
the second thing I learned, is this:

00:06:21.972 --> 00:06:24.000
We have to talk about shame.

00:06:26.285 --> 00:06:28.793
And I'm going to be
really honest with you.

00:06:28.817 --> 00:06:32.341
When I became a "vulnerability researcher"

00:06:32.365 --> 00:06:35.100
and that became the focus
because of the TED talk --

00:06:35.124 --> 00:06:36.521
and I'm not kidding.

00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:39.108
I'll give you an example.

00:06:39.132 --> 00:06:42.045
About three months ago,
I was in a sporting goods store

00:06:42.069 --> 00:06:43.498
buying goggles and shin guards

00:06:43.522 --> 00:06:47.097
and all the things that parents buy
at the sporting goods store.

00:06:47.121 --> 00:06:49.970
About from a hundred feet away,
this is what I hear:

00:06:49.994 --> 00:06:52.625
"Vulnerability TED! Vulnerability TED!"

00:06:52.649 --> 00:06:54.505
(Laughter)

00:06:58.545 --> 00:06:59.546
(Laughter ends)

00:06:59.570 --> 00:07:02.645
I'm a fifth-generation Texan.

00:07:02.669 --> 00:07:05.224
Our family motto is "Lock and load."

00:07:05.248 --> 00:07:08.883
I am not a natural
vulnerability researcher.

00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:11.976
So I'm like,

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.954
just keep walking, she's on my six.

00:07:14.978 --> 00:07:16.398
(Laughter)

00:07:16.422 --> 00:07:19.557
And then I hear, "Vulnerability TED!"

00:07:20.684 --> 00:07:23.231
I turn around, I go, "Hi."

00:07:23.255 --> 00:07:25.885
She's right here and she said,

00:07:25.909 --> 00:07:28.695
"You're the shame researcher
who had the breakdown."

00:07:28.719 --> 00:07:32.533
(Laughter)

00:07:32.557 --> 00:07:37.279
At this point, parents are, like,
pulling their children close.

00:07:37.303 --> 00:07:38.403
(Laughter)

00:07:38.428 --> 00:07:39.771
"Look away."

00:07:42.612 --> 00:07:44.968
And I'm so worn out
at this point in my life,

00:07:44.992 --> 00:07:46.703
I look at her and I actually say,

00:07:46.727 --> 00:07:49.361
"It was a fricking spiritual awakening."

00:07:49.385 --> 00:07:50.976
(Laughter)

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.321
(Applause)

00:07:53.345 --> 00:07:56.202
And she looks back and does this,

00:07:56.226 --> 00:07:57.250
"I know."

00:07:57.274 --> 00:07:58.275
(Laughter)

00:07:58.299 --> 00:08:00.090
And she said,

00:08:00.114 --> 00:08:02.465
"We watched your TED talk in my book club.

00:08:03.116 --> 00:08:06.465
Then we read your book
and we renamed ourselves

00:08:06.489 --> 00:08:08.466
'The Breakdown Babes.'"

00:08:08.490 --> 00:08:09.729
(Laughter)

00:08:09.753 --> 00:08:11.765
And she said, "Our tagline is:

00:08:11.789 --> 00:08:14.976
'We're falling apart
and it feels fantastic.'"

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.829
(Laughter)

00:08:18.853 --> 00:08:22.266
You can only imagine what it's like
for me in a faculty meeting.

00:08:22.925 --> 00:08:23.925
(Sighs)

00:08:25.433 --> 00:08:28.335
So when I became Vulnerability TED,

00:08:28.359 --> 00:08:29.708
like an action figure --

00:08:30.922 --> 00:08:34.914
Like Ninja Barbie,
but I'm Vulnerability TED --

00:08:34.938 --> 00:08:37.617
I thought, I'm going to leave
that shame stuff behind,

00:08:37.641 --> 00:08:40.585
because I spent six years studying shame

00:08:40.609 --> 00:08:43.450
before I started writing
and talking about vulnerability.

00:08:43.474 --> 00:08:46.542
And I thought, thank God,
because shame is this horrible topic,

00:08:46.566 --> 00:08:48.132
no one wants to talk about it.

00:08:48.156 --> 00:08:50.634
It's the best way to shut
people down on an airplane.

00:08:50.658 --> 00:08:52.597
"What do you do?" "I study shame." "Oh."

00:08:52.621 --> 00:08:54.844
(Laughter)

00:08:54.868 --> 00:08:55.976
And I see you.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:00.976
(Laughter)

00:09:02.268 --> 00:09:06.254
But in surviving this last year,

00:09:06.278 --> 00:09:08.929
I was reminded of a cardinal rule --

00:09:08.953 --> 00:09:10.976
not a research rule,

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:15.225
but a moral imperative
from my upbringing --

00:09:15.249 --> 00:09:18.424
"you've got to dance
with the one who brung ya".

00:09:19.329 --> 00:09:21.803
And I did not learn about vulnerability

00:09:21.827 --> 00:09:24.894
and courage and creativity and innovation

00:09:24.918 --> 00:09:27.720
from studying vulnerability.

00:09:27.744 --> 00:09:30.506
I learned about these things
from studying shame.

00:09:31.532 --> 00:09:34.693
And so I want to walk you in to shame.

00:09:35.770 --> 00:09:39.975
Jungian analysts call shame
the swampland of the soul.

00:09:41.386 --> 00:09:43.076
And we're going to walk in.

00:09:43.100 --> 00:09:44.976
And the purpose is not to walk in

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.306
and construct a home and live there.

00:09:48.124 --> 00:09:51.824
It is to put on some galoshes --

00:09:51.848 --> 00:09:54.427
and walk through and find our way around.

00:09:57.023 --> 00:09:58.181
Here's why.

00:10:00.387 --> 00:10:05.593
We heard the most compelling call ever
to have a conversation in this country,

00:10:05.617 --> 00:10:08.229
and I think globally, around race, right?

00:10:10.184 --> 00:10:11.672
Yes? We heard that.

00:10:11.696 --> 00:10:12.696
Yes?

00:10:13.347 --> 00:10:16.767
Cannot have that conversation
without shame.

00:10:16.791 --> 00:10:20.257
Because you cannot talk about race
without talking about privilege.

00:10:20.281 --> 00:10:22.424
And when people start
talking about privilege,

00:10:22.448 --> 00:10:23.847
they get paralyzed by shame.

00:10:24.812 --> 00:10:28.962
We heard a brilliant simple solution
to not killing people in surgery,

00:10:28.986 --> 00:10:30.280
which is, have a checklist.

00:10:31.240 --> 00:10:33.982
You can't fix that problem
without addressing shame,

00:10:34.006 --> 00:10:36.976
because when they teach
those folks how to suture,

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:40.356
they also teach them
how to stitch their self-worth

00:10:40.380 --> 00:10:41.753
to being all-powerful.

00:10:42.507 --> 00:10:45.189
And all-powerful folks
don't need checklists.

00:10:47.577 --> 00:10:49.958
And I had to write down
the name of this TED Fellow

00:10:49.982 --> 00:10:51.505
so I didn't mess it up here.

00:10:52.212 --> 00:10:54.021
Myshkin Ingawale,

00:10:54.045 --> 00:10:55.783
I hope I did right by you.

00:10:55.807 --> 00:10:58.895
(Applause)

00:10:58.919 --> 00:11:00.851
I saw the TED Fellows my first day here.

00:11:00.875 --> 00:11:04.241
And he got up and he explained
how he was driven to create

00:11:04.265 --> 00:11:06.439
some technology to help test for anemia,

00:11:06.463 --> 00:11:08.686
because people were dying unnecessarily.

00:11:09.408 --> 00:11:10.905
And he said, "I saw this need.

00:11:10.929 --> 00:11:12.596
So you know what I did? I made it."

00:11:12.920 --> 00:11:16.175
And everybody just burst into applause,
and they were like "Yes!"

00:11:16.199 --> 00:11:17.894
And he said, "And it didn't work.

00:11:17.918 --> 00:11:19.047
(Laughter)

00:11:19.071 --> 00:11:22.802
And then I made it 32 more times,

00:11:22.826 --> 00:11:23.976
and then it worked."

00:11:24.715 --> 00:11:27.009
You know what the big secret about TED is?

00:11:27.033 --> 00:11:28.606
I can't wait to tell people this.

00:11:28.630 --> 00:11:30.324
I guess I'm doing it right now.

00:11:30.348 --> 00:11:32.452
(Laughter)

00:11:32.476 --> 00:11:34.499
This is like the failure conference.

00:11:34.523 --> 00:11:35.777
(Laughter)

00:11:35.801 --> 00:11:36.946
No, it is.

00:11:36.970 --> 00:11:39.729
(Applause)

00:11:39.753 --> 00:11:41.579
You know why this place is amazing?

00:11:42.978 --> 00:11:45.722
Because very few people here
are afraid to fail.

00:11:47.185 --> 00:11:50.903
And no one who gets on the stage,
so far that I've seen, has not failed.

00:11:50.927 --> 00:11:53.744
I've failed miserably, many times.

00:11:53.768 --> 00:11:56.355
I don't think the world understands that,

00:11:56.379 --> 00:11:57.821
because of shame.

00:11:58.718 --> 00:12:01.077
There's a great quote
that saved me this past year

00:12:01.101 --> 00:12:02.494
by Theodore Roosevelt.

00:12:02.518 --> 00:12:05.580
A lot of people refer to it
as the "Man in the Arena" quote.

00:12:06.604 --> 00:12:07.976
And it goes like this:

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.057
"It is not the critic who counts.

00:12:10.835 --> 00:12:13.406
It is not the man who sits and points out

00:12:13.430 --> 00:12:15.909
how the doer of deeds
could have done things better

00:12:15.933 --> 00:12:17.924
and how he falls and stumbles.

00:12:17.948 --> 00:12:21.015
The credit goes to the man in the arena

00:12:21.039 --> 00:12:25.230
whose face is marred
with dust and blood and sweat.

00:12:25.888 --> 00:12:29.276
But when he's in the arena,

00:12:29.300 --> 00:12:31.466
at best, he wins,

00:12:31.490 --> 00:12:33.350
and at worst, he loses,

00:12:33.374 --> 00:12:35.619
but when he fails, when he loses,

00:12:35.643 --> 00:12:37.373
he does so daring greatly."

00:12:39.228 --> 00:12:41.849
And that's what this conference,
to me, is about.

00:12:41.873 --> 00:12:45.436
Life is about daring greatly,
about being in the arena.

00:12:45.460 --> 00:12:48.509
When you walk up to that arena
and you put your hand on the door,

00:12:48.533 --> 00:12:51.184
and you think, "I'm going in
and I'm going to try this,"

00:12:51.208 --> 00:12:52.583
shame is the gremlin

00:12:52.607 --> 00:12:54.829
who says, "Uh, uh.

00:12:54.853 --> 00:12:56.101
You're not good enough.

00:12:56.583 --> 00:12:59.472
You never finished that MBA.
Your wife left you.

00:12:59.948 --> 00:13:01.996
I know your dad really
wasn't in Luxembourg,

00:13:02.020 --> 00:13:03.326
he was in Sing Sing.

00:13:05.461 --> 00:13:08.094
I know those things
that happened to you growing up.

00:13:08.986 --> 00:13:10.447
I know you don't think

00:13:10.471 --> 00:13:13.328
that you're pretty, smart,
talented or powerful enough.

00:13:13.352 --> 00:13:16.757
I know your dad never paid attention,
even when you made CFO."

00:13:17.884 --> 00:13:19.273
Shame is that thing.

00:13:20.417 --> 00:13:23.837
And if we can quiet it down and walk in

00:13:23.861 --> 00:13:25.671
and say, "I'm going to do this,"

00:13:27.449 --> 00:13:30.976
we look up and the critic
that we see pointing and laughing,

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.350
99 percent of the time is who?

00:13:34.635 --> 00:13:35.694
Us.

00:13:37.302 --> 00:13:38.976
Shame drives two big tapes --

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:40.243
"never good enough" --

00:13:41.846 --> 00:13:43.949
and, if you can talk it out of that one,

00:13:43.973 --> 00:13:45.675
"who do you think you are?"

00:13:47.339 --> 00:13:50.123
The thing to understand
about shame is, it's not guilt.

00:13:50.147 --> 00:13:52.958
Shame is a focus on self,
guilt is a focus on behavior.

00:13:52.982 --> 00:13:54.663
Shame is "I am bad."

00:13:54.687 --> 00:13:56.479
Guilt is "I did something bad."

00:13:57.767 --> 00:13:58.976
How many of you,

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:01.235
if you did something
that was hurtful to me,

00:14:01.259 --> 00:14:04.100
would be willing to say,
"I'm sorry. I made a mistake?"

00:14:04.124 --> 00:14:06.220
How many of you would be
willing to say that?

00:14:06.641 --> 00:14:08.976
Guilt: I'm sorry. I made a mistake.

00:14:09.387 --> 00:14:12.546
Shame: I'm sorry. I am a mistake.

00:14:13.387 --> 00:14:15.950
There's a huge difference
between shame and guilt.

00:14:15.974 --> 00:14:17.546
And here's what you need to know.

00:14:17.966 --> 00:14:20.410
Shame is highly, highly correlated

00:14:20.434 --> 00:14:23.661
with addiction, depression,
violence, aggression,

00:14:23.685 --> 00:14:26.335
bullying, suicide, eating disorders.

00:14:27.375 --> 00:14:29.580
And here's what you even
need to know more.

00:14:29.604 --> 00:14:32.846
Guilt, inversely correlated
with those things.

00:14:34.623 --> 00:14:38.059
The ability to hold something
we've done or failed to do

00:14:38.083 --> 00:14:41.471
up against who we want to be
is incredibly adaptive.

00:14:41.495 --> 00:14:43.861
It's uncomfortable, but it's adaptive.

00:14:47.499 --> 00:14:49.547
The other thing you need
to know about shame

00:14:49.571 --> 00:14:52.190
is it's absolutely organized by gender.

00:14:53.214 --> 00:14:56.036
If shame washes over me
and washes over Chris,

00:14:56.060 --> 00:14:57.648
it's going to feel the same.

00:14:58.338 --> 00:15:00.976
Everyone sitting in here knows
the warm wash of shame.

00:15:01.553 --> 00:15:04.601
We're pretty sure that the only people
who don't experience shame

00:15:04.625 --> 00:15:07.443
are people who have no capacity
for connection or empathy.

00:15:08.125 --> 00:15:10.030
Which means, yes, I have a little shame;

00:15:10.054 --> 00:15:11.546
no, I'm a sociopath.

00:15:11.570 --> 00:15:14.000
So I would opt for, yes,
you have a little shame.

00:15:17.574 --> 00:15:19.589
Shame feels the same for men and women,

00:15:19.613 --> 00:15:21.074
but it's organized by gender.

00:15:22.105 --> 00:15:24.176
For women,

00:15:24.200 --> 00:15:28.505
the best example I can give you
is Enjoli, the commercial.

00:15:29.910 --> 00:15:33.196
"I can put the wash on the line,
pack the lunches, hand out the kisses

00:15:33.220 --> 00:15:35.299
and be at work at five to nine.

00:15:36.037 --> 00:15:38.349
I can bring home the bacon,
fry it up in the pan

00:15:38.373 --> 00:15:40.298
and never let you forget you're a man."

00:15:41.483 --> 00:15:43.971
For women, shame is, do it all,

00:15:43.995 --> 00:15:45.087
do it perfectly

00:15:45.111 --> 00:15:47.042
and never let them see you sweat.

00:15:48.504 --> 00:15:50.976
I don't know how much perfume
that commercial sold,

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:52.656
but I guarantee you,

00:15:52.680 --> 00:15:55.667
it moved a lot of antidepressants
and anti-anxiety meds.

00:15:55.691 --> 00:15:58.855
(Laughter)

00:15:59.654 --> 00:16:02.352
Shame, for women, is this web

00:16:02.376 --> 00:16:06.244
of unobtainable, conflicting,
competing expectations

00:16:06.268 --> 00:16:07.912
about who we're supposed to be.

00:16:09.506 --> 00:16:11.071
And it's a straight-jacket.

00:16:11.784 --> 00:16:12.976
For men,

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:16.425
shame is not a bunch of competing,
conflicting expectations.

00:16:16.449 --> 00:16:18.134
Shame is one,

00:16:18.158 --> 00:16:19.771
do not be perceived as what?

00:16:21.213 --> 00:16:22.245
Weak.

00:16:23.168 --> 00:16:26.418
I did not interview men
for the first four years of my study.

00:16:26.442 --> 00:16:29.700
It wasn't until a man looked at me
after a book signing, and said,

00:16:29.724 --> 00:16:31.252
"I love what say about shame,

00:16:31.276 --> 00:16:33.229
I'm curious why you didn't mention men."

00:16:33.253 --> 00:16:35.234
And I said, "I don't study men."

00:16:35.258 --> 00:16:36.976
And he said, "That's convenient."

00:16:38.313 --> 00:16:41.280
(Laughter)

00:16:41.304 --> 00:16:42.447
And I said, "Why?"

00:16:42.471 --> 00:16:45.302
And he said, "Because
you say to reach out,

00:16:45.326 --> 00:16:47.693
tell our story,

00:16:47.717 --> 00:16:48.876
be vulnerable.

00:16:50.278 --> 00:16:53.976
But you see those books you just signed
for my wife and my three daughters?"

00:16:55.139 --> 00:16:56.146
I said, "Yeah."

00:16:57.084 --> 00:16:59.281
"They'd rather me die
on top of my white horse

00:16:59.305 --> 00:17:00.698
than watch me fall down.

00:17:03.235 --> 00:17:04.976
When we reach out and be vulnerable,

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:06.707
we get the shit beat out of us.

00:17:08.290 --> 00:17:09.608
And don't tell me

00:17:09.632 --> 00:17:12.249
it's from the guys
and the coaches and the dads.

00:17:14.033 --> 00:17:17.124
Because the women in my life
are harder on me than anyone else."

00:17:18.360 --> 00:17:21.002
So I started interviewing men
and asking questions.

00:17:21.864 --> 00:17:23.645
And what I learned is this:

00:17:24.566 --> 00:17:26.947
You show me a woman
who can actually sit with a man

00:17:26.971 --> 00:17:29.007
in real vulnerability and fear,

00:17:29.031 --> 00:17:31.634
I'll show you a woman
who's done incredible work.

00:17:32.388 --> 00:17:34.849
You show me a man who can sit with a woman

00:17:34.873 --> 00:17:36.656
who's just had it,

00:17:36.680 --> 00:17:40.132
she can't do it all anymore,

00:17:40.156 --> 00:17:42.005
and his first response is not,

00:17:42.029 --> 00:17:43.976
"I unloaded the dishwasher!"

00:17:44.497 --> 00:17:45.512
(Laughter)

00:17:45.536 --> 00:17:47.497
But he really listens --

00:17:47.521 --> 00:17:48.976
because that's all we need --

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:51.143
I'll show you a guy
who's done a lot of work.

00:17:52.006 --> 00:17:54.792
Shame is an epidemic in our culture.

00:17:56.696 --> 00:17:59.106
And to get out from underneath it --

00:18:01.440 --> 00:18:03.773
to find our way back to each other,

00:18:03.797 --> 00:18:05.678
we have to understand how it affects us

00:18:05.702 --> 00:18:08.405
and how it affects
the way we're parenting,

00:18:08.429 --> 00:18:11.286
the way we're working,
the way we're looking at each other.

00:18:12.851 --> 00:18:15.875
Very quickly, some research
by Mahalik at Boston College.

00:18:16.279 --> 00:18:19.600
He asked, what do women need to do
to conform to female norms?

00:18:19.624 --> 00:18:21.730
The top answers in this country:

00:18:23.532 --> 00:18:24.976
nice, thin, modest

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:27.242
and use all available
resources for appearance.

00:18:27.266 --> 00:18:29.059
(Laughter)

00:18:29.083 --> 00:18:30.396
When he asked about men,

00:18:30.420 --> 00:18:34.848
what do men in this country need to do
to conform with male norms,

00:18:34.872 --> 00:18:36.429
the answers were:

00:18:36.453 --> 00:18:38.469
always show emotional control,

00:18:38.493 --> 00:18:40.047
work is first,

00:18:40.071 --> 00:18:42.327
pursue status and violence.

00:18:43.420 --> 00:18:45.853
If we're going to find
our way back to each other,

00:18:45.877 --> 00:18:47.976
we have to understand and know empathy,

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:49.976
because empathy's the antidote to shame.

00:18:50.619 --> 00:18:52.912
If you put shame in a Petri dish,

00:18:52.936 --> 00:18:55.245
it needs three things
to grow exponentially:

00:18:55.269 --> 00:18:56.976
secrecy, silence and judgment.

00:18:57.661 --> 00:19:00.915
If you put the same amount in a Petri dish
and douse it with empathy,

00:19:00.939 --> 00:19:02.319
it can't survive.

00:19:02.343 --> 00:19:05.651
The two most powerful words
when we're in struggle:

00:19:05.675 --> 00:19:06.699
me too.

00:19:07.707 --> 00:19:09.842
And so I'll leave you with this thought.

00:19:11.008 --> 00:19:15.390
If we're going to find our way
back to each other,

00:19:15.414 --> 00:19:18.184
vulnerability is going to be that path.

00:19:19.401 --> 00:19:21.914
And I know it's seductive
to stand outside the arena,

00:19:21.938 --> 00:19:23.799
because I think I did it my whole life,

00:19:23.823 --> 00:19:25.076
and think to myself,

00:19:25.100 --> 00:19:27.563
I'm going to go in there and kick some ass

00:19:27.587 --> 00:19:30.023
when I'm bulletproof and when I'm perfect.

00:19:32.102 --> 00:19:33.412
And that is seductive.

00:19:33.436 --> 00:19:36.155
But the truth is, that never happens.

00:19:36.859 --> 00:19:39.017
And even if you got
as perfect as you could

00:19:39.041 --> 00:19:41.629
and as bulletproof as you
could possibly muster

00:19:41.653 --> 00:19:42.748
when you got in there,

00:19:42.772 --> 00:19:44.272
that's not what we want to see.

00:19:46.743 --> 00:19:48.307
We want you to go in.

00:19:49.743 --> 00:19:52.036
We want to be with you
and across from you.

00:19:53.116 --> 00:19:54.808
And we just want,

00:19:54.832 --> 00:19:57.208
for ourselves and the people we care about

00:19:57.232 --> 00:19:59.058
and the people we work with,

00:19:59.082 --> 00:20:00.439
to dare greatly.

00:20:00.463 --> 00:20:02.976
So thank you all very much.
I really appreciate it.

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:07.295
(Applause)
