WEBVTT

00:00:02.335 --> 00:00:03.667
I'm an industrial designer,

00:00:03.691 --> 00:00:05.728
which means I create all these cool things

00:00:05.752 --> 00:00:08.911
from ideas that we surround ourselves
with, or in this case,

00:00:08.935 --> 00:00:11.641
geeky people surround themselves
with, for the most part.

00:00:11.665 --> 00:00:16.043
I have absolutely no background
in biology, chemistry or engineering,

00:00:16.067 --> 00:00:20.254
so bear with me, because I'll be talking
about biomedical engineering today.

00:00:20.278 --> 00:00:21.287
(Laughter)

00:00:21.311 --> 00:00:25.483
And please do stay here in the meantime.

00:00:25.507 --> 00:00:29.478
Industrial design is about
making lots of things identical.

00:00:29.502 --> 00:00:32.200
The downside about that is,
there's something impersonal

00:00:32.224 --> 00:00:33.764
about lots of identical things,

00:00:33.788 --> 00:00:36.741
because when you're trying
to design one thing for one person

00:00:36.765 --> 00:00:38.134
to solve one issue,

00:00:38.158 --> 00:00:39.439
you can't really do that

00:00:39.463 --> 00:00:42.525
when you're making things
aimed more to a demographic model

00:00:42.549 --> 00:00:45.003
or to a marketing requirements document,

00:00:45.027 --> 00:00:46.431
which is what we live by.

00:00:46.455 --> 00:00:49.684
So I got disheartened
by the whole process in general,

00:00:49.708 --> 00:00:52.941
and went to rethink it
and redesign designing altogether,

00:00:52.965 --> 00:00:55.823
went way back to my early, early
design inspirations,

00:00:55.847 --> 00:01:00.113
and back to about eight years old,
and that got me to this guy.

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.205
Anyone here from MIT knows him

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:05.261
or has a tattoo or poster
of him somewhere.

00:01:05.285 --> 00:01:06.298
(Laughter)

00:01:06.322 --> 00:01:08.547
Anyone else in the room, just for a hint,

00:01:08.571 --> 00:01:12.042
he is the engineer of engineers
or the designer of designers.

00:01:12.066 --> 00:01:15.518
He is the guy who made bionics
a household word

00:01:15.542 --> 00:01:18.681
in the form of the polyester-clad
Six Million Dollar Man

00:01:18.705 --> 00:01:20.451
that I grew up with.

00:01:21.165 --> 00:01:23.716
The thing that came from
this pop culture show,

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:26.037
the real takeaway, was two main things:

00:01:26.061 --> 00:01:29.235
if you're designing for the person,
for a real person,

00:01:29.259 --> 00:01:32.470
you don't settle for the minimum
functional requirements;

00:01:32.494 --> 00:01:34.390
you see how far beyond that you can go,

00:01:34.414 --> 00:01:36.853
where the rewards really are
way out in the fringe

00:01:36.877 --> 00:01:39.261
of how far past that document you can go.

00:01:39.285 --> 00:01:40.893
And if you can nail that,

00:01:40.917 --> 00:01:43.425
you stand to improve
the quality of life for somebody

00:01:43.449 --> 00:01:45.646
for every moment
for the rest of their life.

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:49.399
I kind of distilled that down
into a design philosophy,

00:01:49.423 --> 00:01:52.738
and infuse that
into the studio that I have now;

00:01:52.762 --> 00:01:55.766
I'm trying to get everyone
to think along these lines.

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:59.871
It's not a profound philosophy,
but it works for us.

00:02:01.599 --> 00:02:03.377
We work with prosthetic limbs,

00:02:03.401 --> 00:02:06.141
and the first thing you see
about prosthetic limbs

00:02:06.165 --> 00:02:09.357
is that they are engineering brilliance.

00:02:09.381 --> 00:02:10.796
They can do amazing things;

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:14.601
they can return all kinds
of functionality and performance

00:02:14.625 --> 00:02:15.878
back to somebody's life.

00:02:15.902 --> 00:02:18.293
But from the vantage
of an industrial designer,

00:02:18.317 --> 00:02:19.537
they're not quite there.

00:02:19.561 --> 00:02:23.869
What we don't see is the sculpture
or the beauty or the individual qualities

00:02:23.893 --> 00:02:26.453
or the uniqueness or the elegance to them.

00:02:26.477 --> 00:02:31.321
They are brilliant, mechanical,
utilitarian devices.

00:02:31.345 --> 00:02:34.727
And that's great, except
for a lot of people, that doesn't work.

00:02:34.751 --> 00:02:36.746
People come to our studio all the time,

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:39.702
and they have bubble wrap and duct tape,

00:02:39.726 --> 00:02:42.100
trying to approximate their original form.

00:02:42.124 --> 00:02:44.738
Or they'll have a gym sock
stuffed with other gym socks

00:02:44.762 --> 00:02:47.269
to try to recreate
the shape that once was;

00:02:47.293 --> 00:02:50.130
and that, to us, is not thriving.

00:02:50.154 --> 00:02:53.491
The body, to us,
is not a mechanical entity,

00:02:53.515 --> 00:02:56.059
where mechanical-only solutions
can address them.

00:02:56.083 --> 00:02:59.286
It's our personal sculpture,
our kinematic sculpture.

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:00.476
It is our canvas;

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:02.456
it represents not just our physicality,

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:04.590
but also a lot of our personality as well.

00:03:04.614 --> 00:03:06.545
So when you're designing for the body,

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:09.048
maybe the thing isn't to design
for mass production,

00:03:09.072 --> 00:03:11.522
but to design with the body in mind,

00:03:11.546 --> 00:03:14.125
to really think about curves
instead of hard geometry,

00:03:14.149 --> 00:03:17.058
or uniqueness instead of identical.

00:03:17.082 --> 00:03:19.867
The problem is, we're constrained
by mass production,

00:03:19.891 --> 00:03:21.819
which makes a million identical things

00:03:21.843 --> 00:03:24.248
but can't make one unique,
individualized thing.

00:03:24.272 --> 00:03:26.901
So we scrapped that
in the new design process,

00:03:26.925 --> 00:03:28.619
and we start with the person.

00:03:28.643 --> 00:03:30.652
This is a three-dimensional scanner,

00:03:30.676 --> 00:03:32.896
and that's what happens
when you scan somebody:

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:35.435
you get three-dimensional data
into your computer.

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:40.041
You can take the sound-side limb there,
the surviving limb, mirror it over,

00:03:40.065 --> 00:03:41.232
and from now on,

00:03:41.256 --> 00:03:43.638
anything in the process
will recreate symmetry --

00:03:43.662 --> 00:03:45.735
something as personal
and as hard to achieve

00:03:45.759 --> 00:03:47.529
as symmetry in the body.

00:03:47.553 --> 00:03:50.036
And you create a product
that, no matter what,

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:52.355
it's going to be as unique
as their fingerprint.

00:03:52.379 --> 00:03:55.901
In fact, our process is incapable
of creating two identical things.

00:03:55.925 --> 00:03:59.466
So we run it through
computer modeling, 3D CAD.

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:04.439
Here, we actually infuse a lot
of the individual's taste and personality

00:04:04.463 --> 00:04:06.091
into it, everywhere we can,

00:04:06.115 --> 00:04:08.420
and we three-dimensionally
print the results.

00:04:08.444 --> 00:04:10.348
We call the resulting parts "fairings,"

00:04:10.372 --> 00:04:13.359
because they're named
after the panels on a motorcycle

00:04:13.383 --> 00:04:16.693
that turn it from a mechanical thing
into a sculptural thing.

00:04:16.717 --> 00:04:20.207
We tried this on Chad.

00:04:20.231 --> 00:04:22.557
Chad is a competitive soccer player,

00:04:22.581 --> 00:04:24.485
lost his leg eight years ago to cancer.

00:04:24.509 --> 00:04:26.961
You can imagine,
it's really tricky to play soccer

00:04:26.985 --> 00:04:29.931
when you have titanium pipe
where there used to be a leg.

00:04:29.955 --> 00:04:33.986
The resulting parts recreated his shape

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:37.081
and deliberately had an aesthetic
that look like sporting gear.

00:04:37.105 --> 00:04:40.517
We wanted it to make it look like
he just pulled it out of the gym bag,

00:04:40.541 --> 00:04:42.908
so it's fairly utilitarian in that regard.

00:04:42.932 --> 00:04:44.112
Two things happened.

00:04:44.136 --> 00:04:48.438
One, we expected: his sense
of his body came back to him.

00:04:48.462 --> 00:04:51.312
He was suddenly able to control
the ball, to feel the ball,

00:04:51.336 --> 00:04:54.363
because his body remembered
that original shape that he had had

00:04:54.387 --> 00:04:55.613
up until eight years ago.

00:04:55.637 --> 00:04:58.725
The other thing, though,
is that the other members of the team

00:04:58.749 --> 00:05:01.506
stopped thinking of him
as the amputee on the team.

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:05.066
Not that they didn't know, but it stopped
becoming a focal point for him.

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:08.295
And there is a certain
very quiet value in that,

00:05:08.319 --> 00:05:09.809
we like to believe.

00:05:10.537 --> 00:05:13.155
James lost his leg in a motorcycle crash.

00:05:13.179 --> 00:05:16.886
And the motorcycle is still a big part
of James's personality and style.

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:19.747
Check out the tattoo on his forearm.

00:05:19.771 --> 00:05:23.641
We three-dimensionally printed that
into what would be his calf.

00:05:23.665 --> 00:05:26.280
He has his tattoo, he has his morphology

00:05:26.304 --> 00:05:28.618
and he has the materials
of his motorcycle.

00:05:28.642 --> 00:05:33.337
And the result is interesting in that
you can't really tell at first glance

00:05:33.361 --> 00:05:35.788
where the motorcycle stops
and where James starts.

00:05:35.812 --> 00:05:39.275
It's kind of a chimera hybrid
between the two,

00:05:39.299 --> 00:05:41.265
and James likes that.

00:05:41.289 --> 00:05:42.683
(Laughter)

00:05:44.082 --> 00:05:48.560
So, we don't ever try to make something
look like it could be human.

00:05:48.584 --> 00:05:51.474
Our whole goal is to be
unapologetically man-made,

00:05:51.498 --> 00:05:54.191
to take what's already there, morphology,

00:05:54.215 --> 00:05:56.303
and just make it really
cool and beautiful,

00:05:56.327 --> 00:05:58.836
something that somebody
can't wait to show the world,

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:00.396
because that changes their look.

00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:03.685
You don't look at him and say,
"He's an amputee with a prosthetic."

00:06:03.709 --> 00:06:06.464
You say, "He's a guy
with something really cool going on.

00:06:06.488 --> 00:06:08.184
Deborah wanted her curves back,

00:06:08.208 --> 00:06:12.254
but she also just wanted
what came out of it to be really sexy,

00:06:12.278 --> 00:06:14.648
which is great for us to hear.

00:06:14.672 --> 00:06:18.809
We created this lace pattern
that lends itself well to 3D printing.

00:06:18.833 --> 00:06:20.768
We created the first leg, I think,

00:06:20.792 --> 00:06:24.485
where the lace defines
the contour of the leg,

00:06:24.509 --> 00:06:27.264
instead of the leg
giving form to the lace.

00:06:27.288 --> 00:06:29.053
We switched things over.

00:06:29.077 --> 00:06:32.108
What I like about this shot
is you can see daylight through it.

00:06:32.132 --> 00:06:33.943
So we're not trying to hide anything;

00:06:33.967 --> 00:06:36.486
the load-bearing carbon component
is totally visible.

00:06:36.510 --> 00:06:40.204
We're just giving it form
and shape and contours

00:06:40.228 --> 00:06:42.060
that were hers to begin with.

00:06:43.152 --> 00:06:45.909
We made her another leg
that matched her purse,

00:06:45.933 --> 00:06:47.209
just because we could.

00:06:47.233 --> 00:06:49.168
(Laughter)

00:06:51.108 --> 00:06:53.979
(Applause)

00:06:56.022 --> 00:06:59.360
We made another one
where we laser-tattooed the leather,

00:06:59.384 --> 00:07:00.781
because how cool would it be

00:07:00.805 --> 00:07:03.962
to be able to change your tattoos out
from one minute to the next?

00:07:03.986 --> 00:07:05.324
Love that.

00:07:05.348 --> 00:07:08.313
We try to capture as much
of somebody's personality as we can.

00:07:08.337 --> 00:07:11.653
This is George.
His will be finished next week.

00:07:12.137 --> 00:07:15.375
This is the raw computer data
that we deal with.

00:07:15.399 --> 00:07:18.978
He's kind of a classic,
timeless-type personality,

00:07:19.002 --> 00:07:21.908
so we did herringbone tweed,
but in polished nickel.

00:07:21.932 --> 00:07:23.220
(Laughter)

00:07:23.244 --> 00:07:25.664
And Uve was all too proud
to show his tattoos,

00:07:25.688 --> 00:07:29.165
so we are laser-tattooing those
into the leather.

00:07:29.189 --> 00:07:32.178
Part of it is, yes, we're showing off,
because we can do this,

00:07:32.202 --> 00:07:35.623
but the other part is this connects him
to what will be a part of him.

00:07:35.647 --> 00:07:38.279
That is something really valuable;
we believe in that.

00:07:38.303 --> 00:07:40.260
Tattoos are especially exciting for us.

00:07:40.284 --> 00:07:42.081
What happens if you take the tattoo,

00:07:42.105 --> 00:07:45.292
which is a combination
of somebody's personal taste and choice,

00:07:45.316 --> 00:07:46.902
and their morphology,

00:07:46.926 --> 00:07:49.329
but now, let's say, you remove the person.

00:07:49.353 --> 00:07:53.341
You get a free-floating tattoo
defining their body.

00:07:53.365 --> 00:07:57.708
So everything we do is about recreating
and expressing something

00:07:57.732 --> 00:07:59.469
that means something to that person,

00:07:59.493 --> 00:08:02.039
and expressing that through
what would be their body,

00:08:02.063 --> 00:08:05.944
whether it's speed or attitude or bling,

00:08:05.968 --> 00:08:09.859
whatever it is that captures
and suggests them in the best way we can.

00:08:11.251 --> 00:08:13.771
Back to the 3D-printing thing
and this whole process:

00:08:13.795 --> 00:08:17.122
we have a process that lends itself
to making one thing per person;

00:08:17.146 --> 00:08:20.958
it's very individual, and it actually
really lends itself well to complexity.

00:08:20.982 --> 00:08:22.931
So why not just print the entire leg?

00:08:22.955 --> 00:08:26.847
That's the concept that preceded
the work we're doing now.

00:08:26.871 --> 00:08:31.047
This is a three-dimensionally printed leg.
It's symmetric to the other leg.

00:08:31.071 --> 00:08:33.436
It is made in America,

00:08:33.460 --> 00:08:39.111
it is a trivially low-carbon footprint
to create, curbside recyclable,

00:08:39.135 --> 00:08:41.896
costs about 4,000 dollars to create,

00:08:41.920 --> 00:08:44.177
and it is dishwasher-safe.

00:08:44.201 --> 00:08:46.085
(Laughter)

00:08:46.109 --> 00:08:47.591
There's a value to that, too.

00:08:47.615 --> 00:08:49.670
People don't think
about that all the time,

00:08:49.694 --> 00:08:52.504
but yes, throw it in the dishwasher,
it works just great.

00:08:52.528 --> 00:08:56.040
This was based on the original idea
that I could go anywhere in the world

00:08:56.064 --> 00:08:58.677
with nothing more than a camera
and a laptop computer,

00:08:58.701 --> 00:09:02.480
use the camera as a 3D scanner and create
for somebody, in a matter of hours,

00:09:02.504 --> 00:09:06.162
a very high-quality, three-dimensionally
printed leg for a very low cost.

00:09:06.186 --> 00:09:09.864
The proof of concept works great,
we're finding it; we'll get there.

00:09:10.699 --> 00:09:14.532
Or, we upped the quality of the materials
and created this for John.

00:09:14.556 --> 00:09:19.050
The fun thing with John's leg
is that when his fiancee looked at this,

00:09:19.074 --> 00:09:22.973
she joked and said, "I like that leg
better than that leg."

00:09:22.997 --> 00:09:24.670
(Laughter)

00:09:24.694 --> 00:09:28.015
And it's a joke -- she knows full well
what he goes through --

00:09:28.039 --> 00:09:30.647
but at the same time,
there's something very valuable.

00:09:30.671 --> 00:09:32.878
He turned to us and said,
"Nobody says that."

00:09:32.902 --> 00:09:34.570
He's never heard that in his life.

00:09:34.594 --> 00:09:37.277
That connected with him very deeply.

00:09:37.301 --> 00:09:40.595
So we like to think
that this is a new type of design,

00:09:40.619 --> 00:09:44.805
where you're turning
the original process on its head,

00:09:44.829 --> 00:09:48.373
where there is a dialogue that forms
between the designer and the end user,

00:09:48.397 --> 00:09:50.988
where the designer relinquishes
some of the control --

00:09:51.012 --> 00:09:52.352
designers hate doing that --

00:09:52.376 --> 00:09:55.749
and instead, is the curator of a process.

00:09:55.773 --> 00:10:00.046
And the end user relinquishes their body
into the process, and their taste.

00:10:00.070 --> 00:10:03.354
I'd like to think that speaks
to a greater change that's happening

00:10:03.378 --> 00:10:04.938
in the design world altogether;

00:10:04.962 --> 00:10:08.589
in this case, it's one where
products will be evaluated

00:10:08.613 --> 00:10:11.373
on how well they address the individual.

00:10:12.264 --> 00:10:17.286
The individual will actually be
part of the DNA of the end product itself.

00:10:17.310 --> 00:10:21.682
We will be evaluating products
on how well they address a unique person,

00:10:21.706 --> 00:10:23.579
instead of a demographic model.

00:10:24.316 --> 00:10:28.117
This all really hit home for us
in one of the first legs we did;

00:10:28.141 --> 00:10:30.858
when Chad here put on the leg,

00:10:30.882 --> 00:10:32.542
reached down and felt it

00:10:32.566 --> 00:10:34.157
and thought about it for a while.

00:10:34.181 --> 00:10:35.762
Then he turned to us and said,

00:10:35.786 --> 00:10:39.239
"That's the first time I've felt
that shape in eight years."

00:10:39.783 --> 00:10:41.199
We thought about that.

00:10:41.223 --> 00:10:42.485
And for all the technology

00:10:42.509 --> 00:10:45.179
and all the nights
and energy we put into it,

00:10:45.203 --> 00:10:47.165
that's all we really wanted to hear.

00:10:47.769 --> 00:10:48.961
Thanks.

00:10:48.985 --> 00:10:50.468
(Applause)
