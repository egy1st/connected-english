WEBVTT

00:00:00.048 --> 00:00:05.076
We've been asked to address
the theme of changing conversations.

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:07.305
And I think certainly
in the field that I'm in,

00:00:07.329 --> 00:00:09.574
that's a really important point to be at.

00:00:09.598 --> 00:00:12.512
From the discourses that are going on
within architecture

00:00:12.536 --> 00:00:14.131
as well as throughout society,

00:00:14.155 --> 00:00:18.602
I think it is time to change
the way that we look at things.

00:00:18.626 --> 00:00:22.438
As an architect, I've been involved
with architectural projects,

00:00:22.462 --> 00:00:24.359
with urban planning projects,

00:00:24.383 --> 00:00:27.963
and more recently, projects that engage
much more with the landscape.

00:00:27.987 --> 00:00:29.957
Now I can see so many opportunities

00:00:29.981 --> 00:00:33.164
and so many ways
in which design can contribute

00:00:33.188 --> 00:00:36.548
and has the capacity
to effect social change.

00:00:37.115 --> 00:00:39.781
And that's what I'm going
to talk to you today about.

00:00:40.847 --> 00:00:44.717
Starting off, I think it might be useful
to talk a little bit about architecture,

00:00:44.741 --> 00:00:46.348
because I think for many people,

00:00:46.372 --> 00:00:51.812
architecture is a slightly
mystical activity.

00:00:51.836 --> 00:00:54.822
Not many people know what architects do.

00:00:54.846 --> 00:00:58.230
A lot of the time, I'm not sure
the architects know what they're doing.

00:00:58.254 --> 00:01:00.338
But we try,

00:01:00.362 --> 00:01:03.184
and it's important to try and embrace that

00:01:03.208 --> 00:01:05.084
and try and understand what that means.

00:01:05.108 --> 00:01:08.681
When I talk about architecture today,
I'm not talking about the profession.

00:01:08.705 --> 00:01:13.127
I'm not talking about an activity that's
pursued by a select group of people

00:01:13.151 --> 00:01:15.516
with some specialized knowledge.

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.929
I'm talking about architecture
in the bigger sense:

00:01:17.953 --> 00:01:20.210
architecture in terms
of the room that we're in,

00:01:20.234 --> 00:01:22.076
architecture as a pervasive activity,

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:25.414
architecture as the activity
that is the creation of shelter,

00:01:25.438 --> 00:01:26.903
the creation of space,

00:01:26.927 --> 00:01:30.373
the design and the creation
of spaces between buildings,

00:01:30.397 --> 00:01:31.561
the landscape.

00:01:31.585 --> 00:01:33.603
It's man's interaction with the landscape.

00:01:33.627 --> 00:01:36.001
Our construction
of the built environment --

00:01:36.025 --> 00:01:39.327
that's what I mean by architecture.

00:01:39.998 --> 00:01:42.023
It's not a specialized thing.

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:46.016
And over the last, I suppose,
20 or 30 years,

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:49.356
with the predominance of the internet

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.527
and the wonderful
and exciting advancements

00:01:52.551 --> 00:01:54.338
that are taking place in technology,

00:01:54.362 --> 00:01:57.963
one of the things that has happened
is that our perception of the world

00:01:57.987 --> 00:01:59.377
has become commodified.

00:01:59.401 --> 00:02:01.571
It's become reduced in many ways

00:02:01.595 --> 00:02:03.517
to a perception that is two-dimensional.

00:02:03.541 --> 00:02:06.878
We spend a lot of our time,
a lot of our lives,

00:02:06.902 --> 00:02:08.928
looking at the world through screens,

00:02:08.952 --> 00:02:12.765
whether it's our laptops
or television screens

00:02:12.789 --> 00:02:15.774
or monitors at airports
or in the workplace

00:02:15.798 --> 00:02:18.510
or even our telephones are now screens.

00:02:18.534 --> 00:02:22.489
And it has this effect of reducing
our perception of the world.

00:02:22.513 --> 00:02:24.903
It expands it in many ways,
but it can reduce it,

00:02:24.927 --> 00:02:29.115
it can turn into icons our idea
or our notion of certain concepts

00:02:29.139 --> 00:02:33.198
or ideas that are, in fact,
maybe a lot more pervasive

00:02:33.222 --> 00:02:35.465
than the two-dimensional image can convey.

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:37.503
And I think that's true
about architecture.

00:02:37.527 --> 00:02:40.585
I think we've grown accustomed
to thinking about architecture

00:02:40.609 --> 00:02:44.018
in a really primarily
two-dimensional way, in a flat way,

00:02:44.042 --> 00:02:46.992
that the building is about
what it looks like, how it appears,

00:02:47.016 --> 00:02:48.952
it's visual commodity.

00:02:49.967 --> 00:02:51.380
But it's much more than that.

00:02:51.404 --> 00:02:54.368
It's much more than an aesthetic
or just a sensory experience.

00:02:54.392 --> 00:02:55.636
That's very important,

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:57.111
but it's much more than that.

00:02:57.135 --> 00:02:58.716
It's a complex operation.

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:01.824
And a big part of architecture
and a big part of design

00:03:01.848 --> 00:03:04.796
involves understanding the context
in which that design exists

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:06.354
or in which it's going to exist.

00:03:06.378 --> 00:03:09.315
It's having the imagination
to try and predict or project

00:03:09.339 --> 00:03:12.136
where the building
or where the urban space

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:14.326
or where the landscape
is going to be located,

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:15.673
how it's going to be used,

00:03:15.697 --> 00:03:17.958
what are the operations,
what are the activities

00:03:17.982 --> 00:03:20.014
that are going to take place
in that space.

00:03:20.038 --> 00:03:23.180
And you might call those
the programmatic aspects of architecture,

00:03:23.204 --> 00:03:24.926
the programmatic aspects of design.

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:28.947
And I think that in recent times,
we've tended to privilege

00:03:28.971 --> 00:03:31.074
or put at a higher level

00:03:31.098 --> 00:03:35.063
that visual sensory perception
or desire about architecture

00:03:35.087 --> 00:03:38.718
ahead and in advance
of those programmatic needs.

00:03:38.742 --> 00:03:41.541
We've tended to kind of
create monuments, create icons

00:03:41.565 --> 00:03:43.529
that create a sensation or create effect,

00:03:43.553 --> 00:03:47.054
without really thinking through
the value of the operation

00:03:47.078 --> 00:03:50.468
that those places
or those spaces can affect.

00:03:50.492 --> 00:03:54.071
And it's in that zone or in that area
that I think we need to start looking

00:03:54.095 --> 00:03:55.253
or trying to understand

00:03:55.277 --> 00:03:58.516
how architecture or how design
can really impact on society,

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:00.987
and how it can address
some of the problems

00:04:01.011 --> 00:04:02.247
that we're facing.

00:04:02.271 --> 00:04:04.781
The big buzzword in design
and in what I do

00:04:04.805 --> 00:04:06.289
and I think what everybody does

00:04:06.313 --> 00:04:08.097
is the idea of sustainability.

00:04:09.464 --> 00:04:12.691
Sustainability is an idea,
a notion or a concept

00:04:12.715 --> 00:04:17.666
that's triangulated by three very
important concepts or ideas:

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:20.815
the environment, the economy and society.

00:04:21.665 --> 00:04:26.007
Well, the global economy seems to be
currently in a kind of meltdown situation.

00:04:26.031 --> 00:04:28.763
A lot of work needs to be done there.

00:04:28.787 --> 00:04:33.365
The environment
that we live in is challenged.

00:04:33.389 --> 00:04:36.341
We've got global warming,
we've got rising tides,

00:04:36.365 --> 00:04:38.717
we've got all sorts
of disasters taking place,

00:04:38.741 --> 00:04:40.411
all sorts of things happening

00:04:40.435 --> 00:04:45.516
that threaten the equilibrium of the world
and the environment that we live in.

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:48.105
And society itself
is also challenged and threatened

00:04:48.129 --> 00:04:50.259
by some of the issues
that we're faced with.

00:04:50.283 --> 00:04:53.249
I think we've heard about
some of those issues today

00:04:53.273 --> 00:04:57.012
and the need to change the paradigm
in which we perceive those things.

00:04:57.036 --> 00:04:59.018
It's really very crucial that we do that.

00:05:00.016 --> 00:05:01.981
So how does design impact that?

00:05:02.005 --> 00:05:05.272
How can how can I, as a designer,
or anybody as a designer

00:05:05.296 --> 00:05:06.941
or any architect

00:05:06.965 --> 00:05:08.369
or how can society --

00:05:08.393 --> 00:05:11.445
in what way can design impact on that,

00:05:11.469 --> 00:05:13.467
in what way can it affect that?

00:05:13.491 --> 00:05:14.658
I'm going to talk today

00:05:14.682 --> 00:05:17.406
about ways in which I think
design can impact on society,

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:19.343
very specifically on society,

00:05:19.367 --> 00:05:25.474
and how that idea of design
can infiltrate the idea of society

00:05:25.498 --> 00:05:28.516
and work with society
in the operations of society

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:30.269
in this programmatic way

00:05:31.248 --> 00:05:32.725
to effect social change.

00:05:32.749 --> 00:05:37.221
This is an image of Frederick Street
in the early part of the last century.

00:05:37.245 --> 00:05:40.662
And I think it's a good image
in lots of ways.

00:05:40.686 --> 00:05:44.554
It seems like that little triangulation
of the environment,

00:05:44.578 --> 00:05:46.898
the economy and society

00:05:46.922 --> 00:05:48.929
seems to be in a kind of balance.

00:05:48.953 --> 00:05:52.283
So it seems that in cities
we can see that balance

00:05:52.307 --> 00:05:54.122
that cities are symbols or ciphers

00:05:54.146 --> 00:05:58.739
or ways in which we can we can understand
the confluence of those forces.

00:05:58.763 --> 00:05:59.925
And through time,

00:05:59.949 --> 00:06:03.186
there have been times when cities
have done that very successfully.

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:05.371
There are lots of examples
of very good cities

00:06:05.395 --> 00:06:08.586
which have found themselves
at a specific moment in time

00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:10.473
at a point of balance or equilibrium.

00:06:11.819 --> 00:06:14.180
If we look at Port of Spain as a city,

00:06:14.204 --> 00:06:17.464
and we consider the idea
that, once upon a time,

00:06:17.488 --> 00:06:20.043
Port of Spain was just a little cluster,

00:06:20.067 --> 00:06:22.966
a little fishing village
at the mouth of the St. Ann's River.

00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:28.227
And yet it's grown to be
such a big, complex conglomeration,

00:06:28.251 --> 00:06:31.538
a big conurbation of lots and lots
of complex ideas.

00:06:32.078 --> 00:06:34.877
The Italian architect Aldo Rossi,

00:06:34.901 --> 00:06:37.958
a 20th-century architect who died
at the end of the last century,

00:06:37.982 --> 00:06:39.742
made a very profound statement.

00:06:39.766 --> 00:06:43.999
He said architecture is the making
of the city over time.

00:06:44.023 --> 00:06:45.857
I think that's a great statement,

00:06:45.881 --> 00:06:49.233
because it talks, on one level,
about the individual production

00:06:49.257 --> 00:06:51.459
and manufacture
of an object -- architecture --

00:06:51.483 --> 00:06:55.212
and it talks about architecture
as being a form of cultural production,

00:06:55.236 --> 00:06:57.939
as something that speaks to an issue

00:06:57.963 --> 00:07:01.633
or speaks to ideas that are bigger
than the sum of the parts of the building,

00:07:01.657 --> 00:07:03.130
and it relates it to the city.

00:07:03.154 --> 00:07:08.593
It also suggested that it's a constant,
dynamic, changing process.

00:07:08.617 --> 00:07:11.315
And I think that's a very
important thing to understand,

00:07:11.339 --> 00:07:13.036
that it's also part of the program.

00:07:13.060 --> 00:07:16.023
It's nothing to do with visual,
it's to do with the program.

00:07:16.047 --> 00:07:18.355
It's how does this evolve,
what are the dynamics,

00:07:18.379 --> 00:07:20.583
what are the components,
what are the elements

00:07:20.607 --> 00:07:24.144
that contribute to the unraveling
and the creation of the city?

00:07:24.168 --> 00:07:27.739
It also speaks to the fact that the city
is something that can be imagined.

00:07:27.763 --> 00:07:31.785
In the same way as we can conceive
and imagine of a space or a building,

00:07:31.809 --> 00:07:34.771
we can conceive and imagine of a city.

00:07:35.421 --> 00:07:38.632
And it speaks to the idea
of the individual and the collective.

00:07:38.656 --> 00:07:41.733
And it's that link --
the individual to the collective,

00:07:41.757 --> 00:07:44.666
the idea of the civitas, the idea
of the society --

00:07:44.690 --> 00:07:47.095
that I think is a really important axiom

00:07:47.119 --> 00:07:50.186
for understanding
how design can infiltrate

00:07:50.210 --> 00:07:51.960
and how design can effect change.

00:07:51.984 --> 00:07:54.739
These are some images
of how Port of Spain evolved

00:07:54.763 --> 00:07:57.615
over a relatively short
period of 200 years,

00:07:57.639 --> 00:08:02.091
from a colonial plan that was developed
following some ordinances

00:08:02.115 --> 00:08:03.740
sent out by the king of Spain,

00:08:03.764 --> 00:08:05.301
called the Laws of the Indies.

00:08:05.325 --> 00:08:07.778
Many cities in the Caribbean
and Latin America

00:08:07.802 --> 00:08:09.728
were predicated and formulated on this.

00:08:09.752 --> 00:08:12.203
It was a gesture, it was a single design

00:08:12.227 --> 00:08:15.072
that addressed the needs
and the requirements

00:08:15.096 --> 00:08:17.512
of those establishing
cities and new colonies.

00:08:17.536 --> 00:08:21.830
And it expanded, and over time,
as trade began to develop in Trinidad,

00:08:21.854 --> 00:08:23.630
the city expanded, and it grew,

00:08:23.654 --> 00:08:28.267
and it started appropriating,
more and more, the surrounding landscape,

00:08:28.291 --> 00:08:30.602
until it grew to pretty much
what we have today,

00:08:30.626 --> 00:08:33.610
or what we understand to be
the city of Port of Spain.

00:08:33.634 --> 00:08:35.188
But as we all know,

00:08:35.212 --> 00:08:40.808
that process grew also on a kind
of macro scale as well.

00:08:40.832 --> 00:08:44.855
We have the evolution and the development
of this big conurbation

00:08:44.879 --> 00:08:47.909
that stretches from Port
of Spain to the west

00:08:47.933 --> 00:08:49.933
and over to Arouca in the east

00:08:49.957 --> 00:08:51.535
and seems to be continuing.

00:08:51.559 --> 00:08:53.774
So we've developed
into this concept or idea

00:08:53.798 --> 00:08:56.957
that far exceeds the original
Laws of the Indies plan.

00:08:56.981 --> 00:09:01.457
And it's turned into a complex
arrangement and matrix

00:09:01.481 --> 00:09:04.129
of infrastructures and complex issues,

00:09:04.153 --> 00:09:07.874
issues that, in many ways,
have led to a lot of problems.

00:09:07.898 --> 00:09:10.306
They've led to a lot
of infrastructural problems.

00:09:10.330 --> 00:09:12.877
And we share this
with many, many cities in the world.

00:09:12.901 --> 00:09:16.221
Cities all over the world
are expanding, they're increasing,

00:09:16.245 --> 00:09:19.444
they're undergoing the same type
of development that we've undergone

00:09:19.468 --> 00:09:23.218
to the point where the original Port
of Spain and the downtown Port of Spain

00:09:23.242 --> 00:09:26.091
that used to comprise the city,
used to constitute the city,

00:09:26.115 --> 00:09:29.271
has now turned into this sort
of megalopolis, this sprawl,

00:09:29.295 --> 00:09:30.887
and it's difficult to comprehend.

00:09:30.911 --> 00:09:32.531
And when we think of the problems,

00:09:32.555 --> 00:09:36.001
we think of the infrastructural problems:
the water, the power,

00:09:36.025 --> 00:09:37.891
the traffic congestion,

00:09:37.915 --> 00:09:41.943
the crime, the segregation,
the polarization that exists,

00:09:41.967 --> 00:09:45.310
the situation that has led to what's
happened in this country recently

00:09:45.334 --> 00:09:46.827
with the state of emergency ...

00:09:46.851 --> 00:09:49.004
Sometimes it seems
completely insurmountable.

00:09:49.028 --> 00:09:53.362
It seems like we've got to a point
where we can't really control it

00:09:53.386 --> 00:09:55.742
in the way that we can control
that original plan.

00:09:55.766 --> 00:09:57.537
We can't really control this anymore.

00:09:57.561 --> 00:09:59.732
It's almost as if we're
victims of the city,

00:09:59.756 --> 00:10:03.037
rather than people that have willingly
or willfully designed the city

00:10:03.061 --> 00:10:04.447
or formulated the city.

00:10:05.351 --> 00:10:09.806
Another phenomenon that has happened
commensurate with these issues

00:10:09.830 --> 00:10:12.145
of size and scale of infrastructure

00:10:12.169 --> 00:10:15.363
is the predomination
of what I would call "typologies,"

00:10:15.387 --> 00:10:17.727
different types of development.

00:10:17.751 --> 00:10:20.125
We're all familiar
with the high-rise development.

00:10:20.149 --> 00:10:22.000
This is some buildings in Hong Kong,

00:10:22.024 --> 00:10:27.408
you know, the magnificent, tall structures
that cost a fortune to build.

00:10:27.432 --> 00:10:28.590
But they predominate;

00:10:28.614 --> 00:10:30.510
it's almost as if you can't have a city

00:10:30.534 --> 00:10:32.633
unless you've got
a high-rise building in it.

00:10:32.657 --> 00:10:36.369
They're symbolic, they seem emblematic
with modernity and development.

00:10:36.393 --> 00:10:39.426
And then shopping malls
is another predominant type,

00:10:39.450 --> 00:10:42.231
another prevalent type
that all cities want to have,

00:10:42.255 --> 00:10:45.428
the idea that you can
concentrate all these shops

00:10:45.452 --> 00:10:47.886
and all this retail activity in one place

00:10:47.910 --> 00:10:52.472
and create an environment for people
to come and do specific retail functions

00:10:52.496 --> 00:10:56.274
and purchase things and be
in a specific place at a specific time.

00:10:56.298 --> 00:10:59.408
And then the highway, the idea
of cutting through landscapes

00:10:59.432 --> 00:11:01.462
to create how it's to increase the speed

00:11:01.486 --> 00:11:04.011
with which we can get
from one point to another.

00:11:04.035 --> 00:11:06.049
And then we also have
suburban development.

00:11:06.073 --> 00:11:07.683
These are all typologies

00:11:07.707 --> 00:11:10.902
that are emblematic of the type
of development that has taken place

00:11:10.926 --> 00:11:14.225
in modern cities, in Port of Spain
and cities all over the world.

00:11:14.249 --> 00:11:16.457
Now, there's nothing wrong
with shopping malls,

00:11:16.481 --> 00:11:18.214
there's nothing wrong with highways,

00:11:18.238 --> 00:11:21.820
and there's nothing wrong with high-rise
buildings or suburban development.

00:11:21.844 --> 00:11:24.424
What is kind of wrong
is that what we seem to be doing

00:11:24.448 --> 00:11:27.005
is privileging types or ways of building

00:11:27.029 --> 00:11:28.822
or ideas about building

00:11:28.846 --> 00:11:30.843
above other really very important ways

00:11:30.867 --> 00:11:33.825
of how we can conceive
or how we imagine space.

00:11:33.849 --> 00:11:35.549
What about schools?

00:11:35.573 --> 00:11:37.330
What about parks?

00:11:37.913 --> 00:11:40.983
What about making streets
that are really comfortable to walk on

00:11:41.007 --> 00:11:44.974
and the people are not confronting
traffic noise and congestion all the time?

00:11:44.998 --> 00:11:47.532
Where is that in the equation?

00:11:47.556 --> 00:11:51.980
It seems that with our focus on these
types of structures and these typologies,

00:11:52.004 --> 00:11:57.008
which are motivated and driven
primarily because they generate profit,

00:11:57.032 --> 00:11:59.180
they're part of an economic
consumer system,

00:11:59.204 --> 00:12:01.520
they generate profit,
that's why they're favored,

00:12:01.544 --> 00:12:04.580
that's why they are privileged
above other types of development.

00:12:04.604 --> 00:12:06.117
But schools,

00:12:06.976 --> 00:12:08.363
parks,

00:12:08.387 --> 00:12:11.897
elements of cities that used to be really
significant and really important

00:12:11.921 --> 00:12:13.774
are being diminished and marginalized

00:12:13.798 --> 00:12:17.068
as a consequence of the focus
on this type of development.

00:12:17.092 --> 00:12:19.565
They're undermining
the integrity of the city,

00:12:19.589 --> 00:12:21.944
they're undermining
the capacity of the city

00:12:21.968 --> 00:12:25.402
to accommodate social interaction,

00:12:25.426 --> 00:12:27.009
to accommodate everybody,

00:12:27.033 --> 00:12:31.545
because the other thing
is they're also exclusive.

00:12:32.855 --> 00:12:35.707
To work in a high-end office,
you need to be qualified,

00:12:35.731 --> 00:12:36.901
you need to be educated,

00:12:36.925 --> 00:12:38.981
or you need to have
access or the resources

00:12:39.005 --> 00:12:42.852
to get the qualifications or the training
that allow you to get the job in there.

00:12:42.876 --> 00:12:45.314
If you don't have those,
you work outside somewhere.

00:12:45.338 --> 00:12:47.830
We're not concerned about
what those places are like,

00:12:47.854 --> 00:12:49.573
you just go and work somewhere else.

00:12:49.597 --> 00:12:52.185
Similarly, those people that used
to live in the cities

00:12:52.209 --> 00:12:54.664
or used to live and contribute
to the life of cities

00:12:54.688 --> 00:12:58.405
are being pushed out because buildings
like high-rise buildings push them out.

00:12:58.429 --> 00:13:04.128
There's a premium on land price
that pushes people out of cities.

00:13:04.152 --> 00:13:06.977
People can't go to shopping malls
unless they've got cars,

00:13:07.001 --> 00:13:10.516
because those malls are generally
located on the peripheries of cities.

00:13:10.540 --> 00:13:13.051
People can't go buy things
in shopping malls,

00:13:13.075 --> 00:13:15.382
because they don't have
enough disposable income;

00:13:15.406 --> 00:13:17.276
they're not going to spend money there.

00:13:17.300 --> 00:13:20.583
So those types of buildings,
whilst they work for sectors of society,

00:13:20.607 --> 00:13:21.837
don't work for everybody.

00:13:21.861 --> 00:13:23.063
They're not equitable.

00:13:23.087 --> 00:13:27.323
Yet, an undue amount of attention
is paid by government, by society

00:13:27.347 --> 00:13:30.492
on ensuring that those types
of buildings proliferate,

00:13:30.516 --> 00:13:33.958
because they're seen as positive
aspects of development --

00:13:33.982 --> 00:13:38.553
at the expense of types of building
and types of program

00:13:38.577 --> 00:13:40.502
that could be beneficial to everybody,

00:13:40.526 --> 00:13:43.012
types of program
that encourage interaction,

00:13:43.036 --> 00:13:44.282
that encourage education,

00:13:44.306 --> 00:13:46.409
that encourage people
to be with each other

00:13:46.433 --> 00:13:48.170
and encourage a sense of community.

00:13:48.194 --> 00:13:50.597
These types of development
dissipate society,

00:13:50.621 --> 00:13:54.363
they disaggregate society,
they polarize society.

00:13:54.387 --> 00:13:57.775
They create isolated groups of activity

00:13:57.799 --> 00:14:02.087
to which access depends upon how much
money you've got in your pocket.

00:14:02.111 --> 00:14:03.919
It's a polarizing and negative force.

00:14:03.943 --> 00:14:05.340
We see it in this city,

00:14:05.364 --> 00:14:07.582
and we're seeing it more
and more other cities.

00:14:07.979 --> 00:14:10.320
And what ends up happening

00:14:10.344 --> 00:14:13.872
is that we end up with this sort of stack,
that's like a time bomb.

00:14:13.896 --> 00:14:17.672
At some point the system must collapse,
it's really not sustainable.

00:14:17.696 --> 00:14:20.146
It's like the economic
system in the world today --

00:14:20.170 --> 00:14:21.957
it's really not a sustainable system,

00:14:21.981 --> 00:14:24.023
and we have to find ways of addressing it.

00:14:24.047 --> 00:14:26.729
Design can't provide the solution,

00:14:26.753 --> 00:14:31.030
but what it can address is some
of the conditions that people live with.

00:14:31.054 --> 00:14:34.570
It can address some of the circumstances
in which people find themselves,

00:14:34.594 --> 00:14:36.632
some of the areas of cities

00:14:36.656 --> 00:14:38.976
to which people have
been shunted or pushed aside

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:41.689
because they can no longer
afford to live in the center,

00:14:41.713 --> 00:14:43.863
and they can't participate
actively or fully

00:14:43.887 --> 00:14:47.102
in this consumerized, capitalized system.

00:14:47.126 --> 00:14:51.100
And we need to try and conceive
of how we can transform

00:14:51.124 --> 00:14:52.416
these types of spaces,

00:14:52.440 --> 00:14:55.883
how we can integrate the activities
that happen in these types of spaces

00:14:55.907 --> 00:14:57.186
within a bigger picture,

00:14:57.210 --> 00:15:00.765
how we can identify small moves
or small gestures,

00:15:00.789 --> 00:15:04.680
whether through design or economic
initiative or social initiative

00:15:04.704 --> 00:15:08.380
that effect change and that allow
transformation of spaces

00:15:08.404 --> 00:15:12.287
that encourage and facilitate
greater participation.

00:15:13.077 --> 00:15:15.030
And there are lots of ways of doing that.

00:15:15.054 --> 00:15:17.685
And whilst it might seem complex
when we look at cities,

00:15:17.709 --> 00:15:21.188
when we look at the aggregate parts
of cities, it may seem insurmountable.

00:15:21.212 --> 00:15:25.201
But if we try and isolate individual acts,
individual ways of looking at things

00:15:25.225 --> 00:15:30.075
and formulate a program, a manner or way
of understanding how we can do that,

00:15:30.099 --> 00:15:32.516
then we can get nearer
to achieving or effecting

00:15:32.540 --> 00:15:34.213
some kind of social change.

00:15:34.237 --> 00:15:37.111
And there are examples in the world
where that's been done.

00:15:37.135 --> 00:15:40.457
Barcelona is a really good example
of a city where people sat down

00:15:40.481 --> 00:15:43.058
and collectively and actively
tried to conceive of ways

00:15:43.082 --> 00:15:44.879
in which they could effect change,

00:15:44.903 --> 00:15:46.701
and they did it very successfully.

00:15:46.725 --> 00:15:48.492
And nearer to home, in Bogotá,

00:15:48.516 --> 00:15:51.246
Enrique Peñalosa, the mayor of Bogotá,

00:15:51.270 --> 00:15:54.320
when he took office, he decided,

00:15:54.344 --> 00:15:57.737
"I'm not going to spend billions
of dollars on creating more highways.

00:15:57.761 --> 00:15:59.803
I'm going to appropriate the funds I have,

00:15:59.827 --> 00:16:01.439
and I'm going to create places --

00:16:01.463 --> 00:16:06.361
parks that everybody can use,
public spaces that people can use."

00:16:06.385 --> 00:16:09.455
And as he created, more and more
people came into those spaces.

00:16:09.479 --> 00:16:13.388
And those spaces were very effective
in encouraging participation,

00:16:13.412 --> 00:16:15.877
encouraging senses
of community amongst people,

00:16:15.901 --> 00:16:17.436
getting people to come together

00:16:17.460 --> 00:16:21.811
to forget what little trifling contests
they had between each other,

00:16:21.835 --> 00:16:23.378
to start doing things together,

00:16:23.402 --> 00:16:25.330
to start moving around the city together

00:16:25.354 --> 00:16:27.032
and try to start acting together.

00:16:27.540 --> 00:16:30.406
So there are ways of doing it;
there are models.

00:16:30.430 --> 00:16:32.436
And it comes back to this idea of program.

00:16:32.460 --> 00:16:33.637
What's our program?

00:16:33.661 --> 00:16:36.003
Well, I think we want to create
equitable society.

00:16:36.027 --> 00:16:37.672
Then we want to create societies

00:16:37.696 --> 00:16:41.053
where there's active and equitable
participation for everybody

00:16:41.077 --> 00:16:45.299
and where we can break down
some of those inhibitions, those barriers.

00:16:45.323 --> 00:16:47.861
We can remove economic stigma,

00:16:47.885 --> 00:16:50.181
we can remove stigma around race,

00:16:50.205 --> 00:16:52.398
around where you live,
around all those factors

00:16:52.422 --> 00:16:56.108
and try and bring people together
in constructed and effective ways.

00:16:56.132 --> 00:16:58.195
In Trinidad, there are
a number of examples.

00:16:58.219 --> 00:17:00.836
There are opportunities to do this
all over the place.

00:17:00.860 --> 00:17:02.791
This is City Gate.

00:17:02.815 --> 00:17:05.727
It's the entrance to the city
for tens of thousands of people.

00:17:05.751 --> 00:17:07.654
People come in and out of it every day.

00:17:07.678 --> 00:17:11.539
And yet, what they're confronted
with is pretty bleak, horrid, grey,

00:17:11.563 --> 00:17:15.435
unwelcoming and sometimes unsafe

00:17:15.459 --> 00:17:17.690
because of all the traffic zooming around.

00:17:17.714 --> 00:17:21.933
And that space from City Gate
that moves up to Independence Square

00:17:21.957 --> 00:17:26.196
could be a really wonderful experience,
you know, with landscaping,

00:17:26.221 --> 00:17:29.921
with proper accommodation
of the sort of facilities and amenities

00:17:29.945 --> 00:17:32.118
that people would need and would enjoy.

00:17:32.142 --> 00:17:35.468
It could become a really
very important civic space.

00:17:35.492 --> 00:17:36.896
This is the Prado in Havana.

00:17:36.920 --> 00:17:40.161
It's just a notional idea
of how that space could be treated

00:17:40.185 --> 00:17:42.543
so that movement
in and out of the city every day

00:17:42.567 --> 00:17:45.682
becomes a really important
and uplifting transition

00:17:45.706 --> 00:17:48.738
from the maxi taxi
to the place where you work.

00:17:48.762 --> 00:17:51.681
In San Fernando we've got the waterfront,

00:17:51.705 --> 00:17:55.727
which is a really very beautiful part
of this landscape in this country,

00:17:55.751 --> 00:17:57.314
but is in complete neglect.

00:17:57.338 --> 00:18:01.040
There are some really beautiful,
fine examples of 19th-century architecture

00:18:01.064 --> 00:18:04.913
that form, in and of themselves,
some really fine spaces.

00:18:04.937 --> 00:18:08.399
We need to we need to look at
those spaces, we need to appropriate them,

00:18:08.423 --> 00:18:10.455
we need to determine uses for those spaces

00:18:10.479 --> 00:18:12.749
that would encourage
all types of activity:

00:18:12.773 --> 00:18:14.750
spaces for performance,

00:18:14.774 --> 00:18:16.353
spaces for children to play in

00:18:16.377 --> 00:18:20.204
and learn that it's cool and it's OK
and it's fun to be around other people,

00:18:20.228 --> 00:18:23.850
spaces for people to do all the kinds
of activities that people like to do,

00:18:23.874 --> 00:18:26.536
that they enjoy doing collectively

00:18:26.560 --> 00:18:27.868
and that benefit society

00:18:27.892 --> 00:18:29.482
and encourage people to interact,

00:18:29.506 --> 00:18:32.442
regardless of their social
or economic circumstance,

00:18:32.466 --> 00:18:34.421
or places for people to reflect,

00:18:34.445 --> 00:18:37.093
parks, places for people to sit and relax.

00:18:37.117 --> 00:18:39.151
And there are lots of ways we can do that,

00:18:39.175 --> 00:18:43.021
ways in which we can address and look at
how we break down those barriers.

00:18:43.045 --> 00:18:45.121
We can do it with architectural language.

00:18:45.145 --> 00:18:48.015
We can look at the ways
that spaces are formulated

00:18:48.039 --> 00:18:51.207
to break down divisions and barriers
between inside and outside,

00:18:51.231 --> 00:18:53.829
between green and hard surfaces

00:18:53.853 --> 00:18:57.000
and try and generate spaces
that really encourage interaction,

00:18:57.024 --> 00:18:59.190
encourage people to do things together

00:18:59.214 --> 00:19:01.393
and encourage a sense of community.

00:19:01.417 --> 00:19:03.465
We need to mandate government,

00:19:03.489 --> 00:19:06.764
we need to provide examples
to developers, to people

00:19:06.788 --> 00:19:09.483
to generate that the benefit
of these may not be measured

00:19:09.507 --> 00:19:11.322
in a financial return on investment,

00:19:11.346 --> 00:19:15.606
but the social benefit to us all is really
immeasurable in the long run.

00:19:15.630 --> 00:19:19.058
And if we do that,
I think we can demonstrate --

00:19:19.082 --> 00:19:22.872
and we've demonstrated in the past that
designers had the capacity to do that --

00:19:22.896 --> 00:19:25.746
I think if we can do that,
we can demonstrate to people

00:19:25.770 --> 00:19:28.371
that society is an inclusive community,

00:19:28.395 --> 00:19:30.766
and that if everybody is included,

00:19:30.790 --> 00:19:33.178
and if everybody feels part
of the society,

00:19:33.202 --> 00:19:36.381
then we have a much better chance
of ensuring a sustainable future.

00:19:36.405 --> 00:19:37.555
Thank you.
