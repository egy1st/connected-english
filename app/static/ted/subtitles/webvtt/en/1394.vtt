WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
I'm a believer.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
I'm a believer in global warming,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
and my record is good

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
on the subject.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
But my subject

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
is national security.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
We have to get off of oil purchased

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
from the enemy.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
I'm talking about OPEC oil.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
And let me take you back

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
100 years

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
to 1912.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
You're probably thinking that was my birth year.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
(Laughter)

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
It wasn't. It was 1928.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
But go back to 1912,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
100 years ago,

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
and look at that point

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
what we, our country, was faced with.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
It's the same energy question

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
that you're looking at today,

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
but it's different sources of fuel.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
A hundred years ago

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
we were looking at coal, of course,

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
and we were looking at whale oil

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
and we were looking at crude oil.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
At that point,

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
we were looking for a fuel

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
that was cleaner,

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
it was cheaper,

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
and it wasn't ours though,

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
it was theirs.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
So at that point, 1912,

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
we selected crude oil over whale oil

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
and some more coal.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
But as we moved on

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
to the period now, 100 years later,

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
we're back really

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
at another decision point.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
What is the decision point?

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
It's what we're going to use

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
in the future.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
So from here,

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
it's pretty clear to me,

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
we would prefer to have

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
cleaner, cheaper,

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
domestic, ours --

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
and we have that, we have that --

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
which is natural gas.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
So here you are,

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.000
that the cost of all this to the world

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
is 89 million barrels of oil,

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
give or take a few barrels, every day.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
And the cost annually

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000
is three trillion dollars.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
And one trillion of that

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
goes to OPEC.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
That has got to be stopped.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
Now if you look at the cost of OPEC,

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
it cost seven trillion dollars --

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
on the Milken Institute study last year --

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
seven trillion dollars

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
since 1976,

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
is what we paid for oil from OPEC.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
Now that includes the cost of military

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000
and the cost of the fuel both.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:40.000
But it's the greatest transfer of wealth,

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
from one group to another

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
in the history of mankind.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
And it continues.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
Now when you look

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
at where is the transfer of wealth,

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000
you can see here

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.000
that we have the arrows

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
going into the Mid-East

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
and away from us.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
And with that,

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000
we have found ourselves

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000
to be the world's policemen.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000
We are policing the world,

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000
and how are we doing that?

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.000
I know the response to this.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.000
I would bet there aren't 10 percent of you in the room

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.000
that know how many aircraft carriers there are in the world.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.000
Raise your hand if you think you know.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
There are 12.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
One is under construction by the Chinese

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000
and the other 11 belong to us.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.000
Why do we have 11 aircraft carriers?

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.000
Do we have a corner on the market?

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.000
Are we smarter than anybody else? I'm not sure.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000
If you look at where they're located --

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000
and on this slide it's the red blobs on there --

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.000
there are five that are operating in the Mid-East,

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.000
and the rest of them are in the United States.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.000
They just move back to the Mid-East and those come back.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000
So actually most of the 11 we have

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.000
are tied up in the Mid-East.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.000
Why? Why are they in the Mid-East?

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000
They're there to control,

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000
keep the shipping lanes open

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000
and make oil available.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:17.000
And the United States uses about 20 million barrels a day,

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:21.000
which is about 25 percent of all the oil used

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000
everyday in the world.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000
And we're doing it with four percent of the population.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000
Somehow that doesn't seem right.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
That's not sustainable.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000
So where do we go from here?

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000
Does that continue?

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000
Yes, it's going to continue.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000
The slide you're looking at here

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000
is 1990 to 2040.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000
Over that period

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.000
you are going to double your demand.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.000
And when you look at what we're using the oil for,

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
70 percent of it

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000
is used for transportation fuel.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000
So when somebody says,

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000
"Let's go more nuclear,

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.000
let's go wind, let's go solar,"

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.000
fine; I'm for anything American,

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000
anything American.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000
But if you're going to do anything

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.000
about the dependency on foreign oil,

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000
you have to address transportation.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000
So here we are

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000
using 20 million barrels a day --

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.000
producing eight, importing 12,

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000
and from the 12,

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:28.000
five comes from OPEC.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.000
When you look at the biggest user and the second largest user,

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.000
we use 20 million barrels

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.000
and the Chinese use 10.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:39.000
The Chinese have a little bit better plan --

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000
or they have a plan;

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000
we have no plan.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000
In the history of America,

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000
we've never had an energy plan.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.000
We don't even realize the resources

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000
that we have available to us.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000
If you take the last 10 years

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.000
and bring forward,

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:59.000
you've transferred to OPEC a trillion dollars.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.000
If you go forward the next 10 years

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.000
and cap the price of oil at 100 dollars a barrel,

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.000
you will pay 2.2 trillion.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000
That's not sustainable either.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.000
But the days of cheap oil are over.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000
They're over.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.000
They make it very clear to you,

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.000
the Saudis do,

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.000
they have to have 94 dollars a barrel

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000
to make their social commitments.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:30.000
Now I had people in Washington last week told me,

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.000
he said, "The Saudis can produce the oil

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.000
for five dollars a barrel.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.000
That has nothing to do with it.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000
It's what they have to pay for

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.000
is what we are going to pay for oil."

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.000
There is no free market for oil.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.000
The oil is priced off the margin.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.000
And the OPEC nations

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.000
are the ones that price the oil.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.000
So where are we headed from here?

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.000
We're headed to natural gas.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.000
Natural gas will do everything

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000
we want it to do.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.000
It's 130 octane fuel.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.000
It's 25 percent cleaner than oil.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.000
It's ours, we have an abundance of it.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.000
And it does not require a refinery.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.000
It comes out of the ground at 130 octane.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.000
Run it through the separator and you're ready to use it.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.000
It's going to be very simple for us to use.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.000
It's going to be simple to accomplish this.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.000
You're going to find, and I'll tell you in just a minute,

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.000
what you're looking for to make it happen.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.000
But here you can look at the list.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.000
Natural gas will fit all of those.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:37.000
It will replace or be able to be used for that.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.000
It's for power generation, transportation,

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.000
it's peaking fuel, it's all those.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:45.000
Do we have enough natural gas?

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.000
Look at the bar on the left. It's 24 trillion.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.000
It's what we use a year.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000
Go forward

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000
and the estimates that you have

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:58.000
from the EIA and onto the industry estimates --

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000
the industry knows what they're talking about --

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.000
we've got 4,000 trillion cubic feet

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.000
of natural gas that's available to us.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.000
How does that translate

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.000
to barrels of oil equivalent?

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.000
It would be three times

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.000
what the Saudis claim they have.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:16.000
And they claim they have 250 billion barrels of oil,

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.000
which I do not believe.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:23.000
I think it's probably 175 billion barrels.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:26.000
But anyway, whether they say they're right or whatever,

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000
we have plenty of natural gas.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.000
So I have tried to target

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000
on where we use the natural gas.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.000
And where I've targeted

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.000
is on the heavy-duty trucks.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.000
There are eight million of them.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.000
You take eight million trucks --

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000
these are 18-wheelers --

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.000
and take them to natural gas,

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:47.000
reduce carbon by 30 percent,

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.000
it is cheaper

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:52.000
and it will cut our imports

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.000
three million barrels.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:57.000
So you will cut 60 percent off of OPEC

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.000
with eight million trucks.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:02.000
There are 250 million vehicles in America.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000
So what you have

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:07.000
is natural gas is the bridge fuel,

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.000
is the way I see it.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.000
I don't have to worry

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:14.000
about the bridge to where at my age.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.000
(Laughter)

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:19.000
That's your concern.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.000
But when you look at the natural gas we have

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.000
it could very well be

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.000
the bridge to natural gas,

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:28.000
because you have plenty of natural gas.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:31.000
But as I said, I'm for anything American.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:34.000
Now let me take you -- I've been a realist --

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.000
I went from theorist early to realist.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.000
I'm back to theorist again.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:41.000
If you look at the world,

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:44.000
you have methane hydrates in the ocean

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.000
around every continent.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:49.000
And here you can see methane,

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.000
if that's the way you're going to go,

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.000
that there's plenty of methane --

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.000
natural gas is methane,

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.000
methane and natural gas are interchangeable --

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.000
but if you decide

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.000
that you're going to use some methane --

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.000
and I'm gone, so it's up to you --

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.000
but we do have

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:08.000
plenty of methane hydrates.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:11.000
So I think I've made my point

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:16.000
that we have to get on our own resources in America.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:19.000
If we do --

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:22.000
it's costing us a billion dollars a day for oil.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:25.000
And yet, we have no energy plan.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:28.000
So there's nothing going on

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:31.000
that impresses me

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:34.000
in Washington on that plan,

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.000
other than I'm trying to focus

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:39.000
on that eight million 18-wheelers.

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.000
If we could do that,

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.000
I think we would take our first step

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.000
to an energy plan.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.000
If we did, we could see

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:50.000
that our own resources are easier to use

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.000
than anybody can imagine.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:54.000
Thank you.

00:10:54.000 --> 00:11:02.000
(Applause)

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:04.000
Chris Anderson: Thanks for that.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:06.000
So from your point of view,

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.000
you had this great Pickens Plan

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:11.000
that was based on wind energy,

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.000
and you abandoned it basically

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.000
because the economics changed.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.000
What happened?

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.000
TBP: I lost 150 million dollars.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.000
(Laughter)

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:24.000
That'll make you abandon something.

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:27.000
No, what happened to us, Chris,

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:33.000
is that power, it's priced off the margin.

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:36.000
And so the margin is natural gas.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.000
And at the time I went into the wind business,

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.000
natural gas was nine dollars.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:43.000
Today it's two dollars and forty cents.

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.000
You cannot do a wind deal

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:47.000
under six dollars an MCF.

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.000
CA: So what happened was

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:53.000
that, through increased ability

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.000
to use fracking technology,

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:58.000
the calculated reserves of natural gas kind of exploded

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:01.000
and the price plummeted,

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.000
which made wind uncompetitive.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:05.000
In a nutshell that's what happened?

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:07.000
TBP: That's what happened.

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:09.000
We found out that we could go to the source rock,

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:12.000
which were the carboniferous shales in the basins.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:15.000
The first one was Barnett Shale in Texas

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:18.000
and then the Marcellus up in the Northeast

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:21.000
across New York, Pennsylvania, West Virginia;

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:23.000
and Haynesville in Louisiana.

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:25.000
This stuff is everywhere.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.000
We are overwhelmed with natural gas.

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:31.000
CA: And now you're a big investor in that and bringing that to market?

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:33.000
TBP: Well you say a big investor.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:35.000
It's my life.

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:37.000
I'm a geologist, got out of school in '51,

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.000
and I've been in the industry my entire life.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:42.000
Now I do own stocks.

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:45.000
I'm not a big natural gas producer.

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:47.000
Somebody the other day said

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:49.000
I was the second largest natural gas producer in the United States.

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:51.000
Don't I wish.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:54.000
But no, I'm not. I own stocks.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:57.000
But I also am in the fueling business.

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:00.000
CA: But natural gas is a fossil fuel.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.000
You burn it,

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:04.000
you release CO2.

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:08.000
So you believe in the threat of climate change.

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:10.000
Why doesn't that prospect

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.000
concern you?

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:15.000
TBP: Well you're going to have to use something.

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:18.000
What do you have to replace it?

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:24.000
(Laughter)

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:27.000
CA: No, no. The argument that it's a bridge fuel makes sense,

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:31.000
because the amount of CO2 per unit of energy

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:34.000
is lower than oil and coal, correct?

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:37.000
And so everyone can be at least happy

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:40.000
to see a shift from coal or oil to natural gas.

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:42.000
But if that's it

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.000
and that becomes the reason

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:47.000
that renewables don't get invested in,

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:50.000
then, long-term, we're screwed anyway, right?

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.000
TBP: Well I'm not ready to give up,

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:54.000
but Jim and I talked

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.000
there as he left,

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:58.000
and I said, "How do you feel about natural gas?"

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:01.000
And he said, "Well it's a bridge fuel, is what it is."

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:03.000
And I said, "Bridge to what?

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:05.000
Where are we headed?"

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:07.000
See but again, I told you, I don't have to worry with that.

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:09.000
You all do.

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:11.000
CA: But I don't think that's right, Boone.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:14.000
I think you're a person who believes in your legacy.

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.000
You've made the money you need.

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:19.000
You're one of the few people in a position

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:22.000
to really swing the debate.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:25.000
Do you support the idea of some kind of price on carbon?

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:27.000
Does that make sense?

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:29.000
TBP: I don't like that

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:32.000
because it ends up the government is going to run the program.

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.000
I can tell you it will be a failure.

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:37.000
The government is not successful

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.000
on these things.

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:42.000
They just aren't, it's a bad deal.

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:45.000
Look at Solyndra, or whatever it was.

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:47.000
I mean, that was told to be a bad idea 10 times,

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:49.000
they went ahead and did it anyway.

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:52.000
But that only blew out 500 million.

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:55.000
I think it's closer to a billion.

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:58.000
But Chris, I think where we're headed,

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:01.000
the long-term,

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.000
I don't mind going back to nuclear.

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:05.000
And I can tell you what the last page

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:07.000
of the report that will take them five years to write

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:09.000
will be.

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:12.000
One, don't build a reformer on a fault.

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:14.000
(Laughter)

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:16.000
And number two,

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:19.000
do not build a reformer on the ocean.

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:22.000
And now I think reformers are safe.

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:24.000
Move them inland

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:28.000
and on very stable ground

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:30.000
and build the reformers.

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:32.000
There isn't anything wrong with nuke.

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:34.000
You're going to have to have energy. There is no question.

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:36.000
You can't -- okay.

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:39.000
CA: One of the questions from the audience

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:42.000
is, with fracking and the natural gas process,

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:45.000
what about the problem of methane leaking from that,

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:47.000
methane being a worse global warming gas

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:49.000
than CO2?

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:51.000
Is that a concern?

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:53.000
TBP: Fracking? What is fracking?

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:56.000
CA: Fracking.

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:58.000
TBP: I'm teasing.

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:00.000
(Laughter)

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:04.000
CA: We've got a little bit of accent incompatibility here, you know.

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:06.000
TBP: No, let me tell you,

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:08.000
I've told you what my age was.

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:10.000
I got out of school in '51.

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:12.000
I witnessed my first frack job

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:14.000
at border Texas in 1953.

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:16.000
Fracking came out in '47,

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:18.000
and don't believe for a minute

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:20.000
when our president gets up there

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:23.000
and says the Department of Energy 30 years ago

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:25.000
developed fracking.

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:28.000
I don't know what in the hell he's talking about.

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:30.000
I mean seriously, the Department of Energy

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:33.000
did not have anything to do with fracking.

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:35.000
The first frack job was in '47.

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:38.000
I saw my first one in '53.

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:41.000
I've fracked over 3,000 wells in my life.

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:43.000
Never had a problem

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:45.000
with messing up an aquifer or anything else.

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:48.000
Now the largest aquifer in North America

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:51.000
is from Midland, Texas to the South Dakota border,

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:53.000
across eight states --

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:55.000
big aquifer:

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:58.000
Ogallala, Triassic age.

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:01.000
There had to have been 800,000 wells fracked

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:04.000
in Oklahoma, Texas, Kansas

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:06.000
in that aquifer.

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:08.000
There's no problems.

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:10.000
I don't understand why

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:14.000
the media is focused on Eastern Pennsylvania.

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:17.000
CA: All right, so you don't support a carbon tax of any kind

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:19.000
or a price on carbon.

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:22.000
Your picture then I guess

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:24.000
of how the world eventually gets off fossil fuels

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:27.000
is through innovation ultimately,

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:32.000
that we'll someday make solar and nuclear cost competitive?

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:36.000
TBP: Solar and wind, Jim and I agreed on that in 13 seconds.

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:38.000
That is, it's going to be a small part,

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:40.000
because you can't rely on it.

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:42.000
CA: So how does the world get off fossil fuels?

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:44.000
TBP: How do we get there?

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:46.000
We have so much natural gas,

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:48.000
a day will not come

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:50.000
where you say, "Well let's don't use that anymore."

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:53.000
You'll keep using it. It is the cleanest of all.

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:55.000
And if you look at California,

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:57.000
they use 2,500 buses.

00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:01.000
LAMTA have been on natural gas

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:03.000
for 25 years.

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:05.000
The Ft. Worth T

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:07.000
has been on it for 25 years.

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:10.000
Why? Air quality was the reason they used natural gas

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:12.000
and got away from diesel.

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:14.000
Why are all the trash trucks today in Southern California

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:16.000
on natural gas?

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:18.000
It's because of air quality.

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:21.000
I know what you're telling me, and I'm not disagreeing with you.

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:24.000
How in the hell can we get off the natural gas at some point?

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:27.000
And I say, that is your problem.

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:29.000
(Laughter)

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:31.000
CA: All right,

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:33.000
so it's the bridge fuel.

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:35.000
What is at the other end of that bridge

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:37.000
is for this audience to figure out.

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:39.000
If someone comes to you with a plan

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:41.000
that really looks like it might be part of this solution,

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:44.000
are you ready to invest in those technologies,

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:46.000
even if they aren't maximized for profits,

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:49.000
they might be maximized for the future health of the planet?

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:52.000
TBP: I lost 150 million on the wind, okay.

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:55.000
Yeah, sure, I'm game for it.

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:58.000
Because, again,

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:02.000
I'm trying to get energy solved for America.

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:05.000
And anything American

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:07.000
will work for me.

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:09.000
CA: Boone, I really, really appreciate you coming here,

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:11.000
engaging in this conversation.

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:14.000
I think there's a lot of people who will want to engage with you.

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:16.000
And that was a real gift you gave this audience.

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:19.000
Thank you so much. (TBP: You bet, Chris. Thank you.)

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:21.000
(Applause)
