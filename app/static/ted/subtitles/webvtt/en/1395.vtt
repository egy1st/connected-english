00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
I like to build stuff.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
I've always liked to build stuff.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
My team at Biosense,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
a startup I co-founded with my doctor and engineer friends,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
has built a technology called ToucHB,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
which can do blood testing of hemoglobin

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
without pricks, without needles.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
I believe

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
this is going to democratize health care.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
They're two big words, I don't know what they mean.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
(Laughter)

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
In fact, in 2009, I was even more clueless.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
I had absolutely no idea

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
what was going to happen next.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
I was, in fact, busy trying to finish off my Ph.D.,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
which was in a completely unrelated area

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
of how people interact, contributors interact,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
how articles are formed in Wikipedia --

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
trying to figure out how quality emerges from the system.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
I was also building something

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
called the Copenhagen Wheel,

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
which is just a really beautiful, beautiful electric bike

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
at a lab at MIT called SENSEable City Lab.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
I was lucky enough that I visited Mumbai, my house,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
back for a vacation.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
So at that time

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
I was planning a road trip.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
I visited a place called Parol

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
about two hours north of Mumbai.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.000
This is a place where my friend, Abhishek Sen was interning.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
He's a doctor there.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
And that's his actual photograph.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
(Laughter)

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
So Abhishek actually made me wait.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
He was out there in Parol delivering a baby.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
I was waiting, and when he did emerge,

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
he was ashen-faced.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000
He told me that there had been two deaths;

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
the mother and child both had died.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
The reason, he told me,

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
was something called post partum hemorrhage.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
He explained this meant severe internal bleeding.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
What was really shocking for me

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
was that he said that this is entirely due

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
to undiagnosed anemia.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.000
Now anemia -- I'm an engineer, but even I knew --

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
that anemia is something which is not supposed to be fatal.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
It is something which probably the cure is known.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
I mean, folic acid, iron tablets --

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
very cheap, affordable cures exist

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
to control anemia.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
So why was this woman dying?

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
It was completely preventable.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
Five minutes away from there,

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000
I had the center, the medical center,

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000
which was distributing subsidized iron tablets.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000
So the whole nature of this thing completely shocked me.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
And I knew that there had to be a way to prevent this.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
My mom is a pediatrician, and I asked her.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
She told me that this is how you would typically test for anemia.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
Take a blood sample

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000
and run it through a machine called a Coulter counter.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
This is a $10,000 machine which was available in Mumbai.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
It's also available here or in any part, I guess,

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
in Europe and most cities in the world.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000
But this is not available in Parol.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
Also, that woman who was operating the machine, the technician,

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
is not available in Parol.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.000
(Laughter)

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
Now this struck me as --

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000
I love to fix things. I wanted to fix this.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
I got a friend of mine, an engineer, and three other doctors --

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000
Abhishek joined the team --

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000
and we wanted to solve this problem.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
By the time I step down from here

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
there will be 10 people who have lost their lives

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000
through a completely, completely preventable problem.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
Now let me take you back to Parol.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000
You saw the woman there, the nurse.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000
In India this is called an ASHA worker.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000
It's essentially a village health worker, a matron.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
She is really the center of the health care system.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
Public health care runs on the ASHA worker,

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
not the doctor.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.000
Now we knew we had to design something

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000
which she could use.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000
We knew it had to be these three things that the machine had to have.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000
We knew it had to be something

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000
which had no needles, no pricking,

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.000
so it would have adoption, it would not have medical waste,

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000
all those problems.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000
It had to be simple enough for that woman ASHA worker to use.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.000
And thirdly, it had to be something which she could carry in her kit.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000
She goes village to village doing screenings.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000
We thought we could build it,

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.000
so we built it.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:05.000
(Applause)

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.000
But, but it didn't work.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000
(Laughter)

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000
So we built it again.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000
And we did this 32 times.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.000
(Laughter)

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000
But I'm very excited to tell you

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.000
that last year

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.000
we did build it -- it works.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.000
And I have it here in my purse.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
So this is a machine

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000
called the ToucHB Quik.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.000
What it does

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.000
is it measures my hemoglobin, oxygen and pulse rate.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.000
I put it on my finger, switch it on,

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000
and in about 20 seconds

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000
it'll give me, on the little screen here,

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000
a value of hemoglobin,

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.000
oxygen saturation and heart rate.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000
This will help ASHA workers

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000
diagnose anemia at the point of care.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:03.000
(Applause)

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000
I'll explain a little bit about how it works.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000
You might have seen a little light inside of it.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.000
In fact, there are three lights in there, three wavelengths of light.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.000
And we essentially pass light

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000
right through the tissue,

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.000
and from understanding how much of it is transmitted,

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000
how much of it is scattered and how much of it is absorbed,

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000
we can figure out

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000
how much hemoglobin is there in the blood.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000
And this is something which is based on a principle

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000
called photoplethysmography.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000
We are actually really very excited

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.000
about what else non-invasive techniques like this

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.000
will be able to crack in the future.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.000
One of the things which my intern here, Pratesh, built

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000
is a mobile application,

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000
which can now send all this data anywhere it wants to go.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.000
There's a bunch of very exciting stuff which we are doing.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.000
I would love to tell you a little bit more about it.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.000
But fundamentally,

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000
what I believe is that the map behind of me

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000
is called basically the map of anemia.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.000
It's the death rates caused by anemia globally.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000
You'll notice, of course,

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000
that there are hot spots --

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000
South Asia, Africa.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.000
My business plan is very simple.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.000
I'm just going to sell these to every clinic in the world.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.000
That's a simple bottom-line business plan.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.000
And by the time I'm done, in 2020,

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.000
when the WHO publishes the data again,

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.000
this is going to be the map of anemia.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.000
(Applause)

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000
Thank you.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000
(Applause)
