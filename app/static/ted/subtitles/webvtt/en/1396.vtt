00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
One out of two of you women

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
will be impacted by cardiovascular disease

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
in your lifetime.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
So this is the leading killer of women.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
It's a closely held secret

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
for reasons I don't know.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
In addition to making this personal --

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
so we're going to talk about your relationship with your heart

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
and all women's relationship with their heart --

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
we're going to wax into the politics.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Because the personal, as you know, is political.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
And not enough is being done about this.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
And as we have watched women

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
conquer breast cancer

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
through the breast cancer campaign,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
this is what we need to do now with heart.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
Since 1984,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
more women die in the U.S. than men.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
So where we used to think of heart disease

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
as being a man's problem primarily --

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
which that was never true,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
but that was kind of how everybody thought in the 1950s and '60s,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
and it was in all the textbooks.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
It's certainly what I learned when I was training.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
If we were to remain sexist, and that was not right,

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
but if we were going to go forward and be sexist,

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
it's actually a woman's disease.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
So it's a woman's disease now.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
And one of the things that you see

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
is that male line,

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
the mortality is going down, down, down, down, down.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
And you see the female line since 1984,

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
the gap is widening.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
More and more women, two, three, four times more women,

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
dying of heart disease than men.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
And that's too short of a time period

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
for all the different risk factors that we know

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
to change.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
So what this really suggested to us

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
at the national level

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.000
was that diagnostic and therapeutic strategies,

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
which had been developed in men, by men, for men

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
for the last 50 years --

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
and they work pretty well in men, don't they? --

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
weren't working so well for women.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
So that was a big wake-up call

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
in the 1980's.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
Heart disease kills more women

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
at all ages

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
than breast cancer.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
And the breast cancer campaign --

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
again, this is not a competition.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000
We're trying to be as good as the breast cancer campaign.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000
We need to be as good as the breast cancer campaign

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
to address this crisis.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
Now sometimes when people see this,

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
I hear this gasp.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
We can all think of someone,

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
often a young woman,

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
who has been impacted by breast cancer.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
We often can't think of a young woman

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
who has heart disease.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
I'm going to tell you why.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
Heart disease kills people,

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000
often very quickly.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000
So the first time heart disease strikes in women and men,

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000
half of the time it's sudden cardiac death --

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
no opportunity to say good-bye,

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
no opportunity to take her to the chemotherapy,

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000
no opportunity to help her pick out a wig.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
Breast cancer,

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000
mortality is down to four percent.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
And that is the 40 years

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.000
that women have advocated.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000
Betty Ford, Nancy Reagan stood up

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
and said, "I'm a breast cancer survivor,"

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
and it was okay to talk about it.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000
And then physicians have gone to bat.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
We've done the research.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
We have effective therapies now.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
Women are living longer than ever.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000
That has to happen in heart disease, and it's time.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.000
It's not happening, and it's time.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000
We owe an incredible debt of gratitude

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
to these two women.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000
As Barbara depicted

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.000
in one of her amazing movies, "Yentl,"

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000
she portrayed a young woman

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000
who wanted an education.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000
And she wanted to study the Talmud.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000
And so how did she get educated then?

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000
She had to impersonate a man.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000
She had to look like a man.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.000
She had to make other people believe that she looked like a man

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000
and she could have the same rights

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000
that the men had.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
Bernadine Healy, Dr. Healy,

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
was a cardiologist.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.000
And right around that time, in the 1980's,

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000
that we saw women and heart disease deaths

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000
going up, up, up, up, up,

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000
she wrote an editorial

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000
in the New England Journal of Medicine

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.000
and said, the Yentl syndrome.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000
Women are dying of heart disease,

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.000
two, three, four times more than men.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000
Mortality is not going down, it's going up.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000
And she questioned,

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
she hypothesized,

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
is this a Yentl syndrome?

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
And here's what the story is.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.000
Is it because women don't look like men,

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.000
they don't look like that male-pattern heart disease

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.000
that we've spent the last 50 years understanding

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000
and getting really good diagnostics

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000
and really good therapeutics,

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000
and therefore, they're not recognized for their heart disease.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000
And they're just passed.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.000
They don't get treated, they don't get detected,

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.000
they don't get the benefit of all the modern medicines.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000
Doctor Healy then subsequently became

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000
the first female director

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000
of our National Institutes of Health.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.000
And this is the biggest biomedical enterprise research

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000
in the world.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000
And it funds a lot of my research.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000
It funds research all over the place.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000
It was a very big deal

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000
for her to become director.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000
And she started,

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000
in the face of a lot of controversy,

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000
the Women's Health Initiative.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000
And every woman in the room here

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000
has benefited from that Women's Health Initiative.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.000
It told us about hormone replacement therapy.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000
It's informed us about osteoporosis.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.000
It informed us about breast cancer, colon cancer in women.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.000
So a tremendous fund of knowledge

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000
despite, again,

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000
that so many people told her not to do it,

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000
it was too expensive.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.000
And the under-reading was women aren't worth it.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.000
She was like, "Nope. Sorry. Women are worth it."

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.000
Well there was a little piece of that Women's Health Initiative

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000
that went to National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute,

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.000
which is the cardiology part of the NIH.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000
And we got to do the WISE study --

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:01.000
and the WISE stands for Women's Ischemia Syndrome Evaluation --

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.000
and I have chaired this study for the last 15 years.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.000
It was a study to specifically ask,

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000
what's going on with women?

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000
Why are more and more women dying

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000
of ischemic heart disease?

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.000
So in the WISE, 15 years ago,

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.000
we started out and said, "Well wow, there's a couple of key observations

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000
and we should probably follow up on that."

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.000
And our colleagues in Washington, D.C.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.000
had recently published

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.000
that when women have heart attacks and die,

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.000
compared to men who have heart attacks and die --

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000
and again, this is millions of people,

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.000
happening every day --

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000
women, in their fatty plaque --

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.000
and this is their coronary artery,

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.000
so the main blood supply going into the heart muscle --

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.000
women erode,

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.000
men explode.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.000
You're going to find some interesting analogies

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.000
in this physiology.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:55.000
(Laughter)

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.000
So I'll describe the male-pattern heart attack first.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000
Hollywood heart attack. Ughhhh.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000
Horrible chest pain.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000
EKG goes pbbrrhh,

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:07.000
so the doctors can see this hugely abnormal EKG.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000
There's a big clot in the middle of the artery.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000
And they go up to the cath lab

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.000
and boom, boom, boom get rid of the clot.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000
That's a man heart attack.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.000
Some women have those heart attacks,

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.000
but a whole bunch of women have this kind of heart attack,

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.000
where it erodes,

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.000
doesn't completely fill with clot, symptoms are subtle,

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.000
EKG findings are different --

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.000
female-pattern.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:31.000
So what do you think happens to these gals?

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.000
They're often not recognized, sent home.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:36.000
I'm not sure what it was. Might have been gas.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.000
So we picked up on that

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:41.000
and we said, "You know, we now have the ability

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:44.000
to look inside human beings

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.000
with these special catheters called IVUS:

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.000
intravascular ultrasound."

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:51.000
And we said, "We're going to hypothesize

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:54.000
that the fatty plaque in women

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.000
is actually probably different,

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.000
and deposited differently, than men."

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:02.000
And because of the common knowledge

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000
of how women and men get fat.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:08.000
When we watch people become obese,

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:11.000
where do men get fat?

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:15.000
Right here, it's just a focal -- right there.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.000
Where do women get fat?

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.000
All over.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:23.000
Cellulite here, cellulite here.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.000
So we said, "Look, women look like they're pretty good

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.000
about putting kind of the garbage away,

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.000
smoothly putting it away.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:32.000
Men just have to dump it in a single area."

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.000
So we said, "Let's look at these."

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:37.000
And so the yellow is the fatty plaque,

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.000
and panel A is a man.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.000
And you can see, it's lumpy bumpy.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:44.000
He's got a beer belly in his coronary arteries.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000
Panel B is the woman, very smooth.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.000
She's just laid it down nice and tidy.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000
(Laughter)

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.000
And if you did that angiogram,

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.000
which is the red,

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.000
you can see the man's disease.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.000
So 50 years

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.000
of honing and crafting these angiograms,

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000
we easily recognize

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000
male-pattern disease.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.000
Kind of hard to see that female-pattern disease.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.000
So that was a discovery.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:11.000
Now what are the implications of that?

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.000
Well once again, women get the angiogram

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:16.000
and nobody can tell that they have a problem.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:19.000
So we are working now on a non-invasive --

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.000
again, these are all invasive studies.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:24.000
Ideally you would love to do all this non-invasively.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.000
And again, 50 years

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.000
of good non-invasive stress testing,

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.000
we're pretty good at recognizing male-pattern disease

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.000
with stress tests.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.000
So this is cardiac magnetic resonance imaging.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:37.000
We're doing this at the Cedars-Sinai Heart Institute

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.000
in the Women's Heart Center.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:42.000
We selected this for the research.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:44.000
This is not in your community hospital,

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.000
but we would hope to translate this.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.000
And we're about two and a half years

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.000
into a five-year study.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.000
This was the only modality

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.000
that can see the inner lining of the heart.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.000
And if you look carefully, you can see

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.000
that there's a black blush right there.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:01.000
And that is microvascular obstruction.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:04.000
The syndrome, the female-pattern

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:08.000
now is called microvascular coronary dysfunction, or obstruction.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:11.000
The second reason we really liked MRI

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.000
is that there's no radiation.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:16.000
So unlike the CAT scans, X-rays, thalliums,

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.000
for women

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.000
whose breast is in the way

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.000
of looking at the heart,

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:25.000
every time we order something that has even a small amount of radiation,

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.000
we say, "Do we really need that test?"

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.000
So we're very excited about M.R.

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.000
You can't go and order it yet,

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:33.000
but this is an area of active inquiry

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.000
where actually studying women

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:38.000
is going to advance the field for women and men.

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:42.000
What are the downstream consequences

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:45.000
then, when female-pattern heart disease

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.000
is not recognized?

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.000
This is a figure

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.000
from an editorial that I published

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:54.000
in the European Heart Journal this last summer.

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.000
And it was just a pictogram

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.000
to sort of show

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.000
why more women are dying of heart disease,

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.000
despite these good treatments

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:05.000
that we know and we have work.

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:07.000
And when the woman

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.000
has male-pattern disease --

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:12.000
so she looks like Barbara in the movie --

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.000
they get treated.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:17.000
And when you have female-pattern and you look like a woman,

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:20.000
as Barbara does here with her husband,

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.000
they don't get the treatment.

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.000
These are our life-saving treatments.

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:27.000
And those little red boxes are deaths.

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.000
So those are the consequences.

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.000
And that is female-pattern

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:33.000
and why we think the Yentl syndrome

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.000
actually is explaining

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:38.000
a lot of these gaps.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:41.000
There's been wonderful news also

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:43.000
about studying women,

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.000
finally, in heart disease.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:47.000
And one of the the cutting-edge areas

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.000
that we're just incredibly excited about

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.000
is stem cell therapy.

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:54.000
If you ask, what is the big difference

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.000
between women and men physiologically?

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:59.000
Why are there women and men?

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:02.000
Because women bring new life into the world.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.000
That's all stem cells.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.000
So we hypothesized

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:09.000
that female stem cells might be better

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:12.000
at identifying the injury,

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.000
doing some cellular repair

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.000
or even producing new organs,

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.000
which is one of the things

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:21.000
that we're trying to do with stem cell therapy.

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:24.000
These are female and male stem cells.

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:26.000
And if you had an injured organ,

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.000
if you had a heart attack

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:31.000
and we wanted to repair that injured area,

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:33.000
do you want those robust,

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:36.000
plentiful stem cells on the top?

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.000
Or do you want these guys,

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.000
that look like they're out to lunch?

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:42.000
(Laughter)

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:45.000
And some of our investigative teams

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:47.000
have demonstrated

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:49.000
that female stem cells --

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:51.000
and this is in animals

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.000
and increasingly we're showing this in humans --

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.000
that female stem cells,

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.000
when put even into a male body,

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:00.000
do better than male stem cells

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.000
going into a male body.

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:04.000
One of the things that we say

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:06.000
about all of this female physiology --

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:09.000
because again, as much as we're talking about women and heart disease,

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:11.000
women do, on average,

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:13.000
have better longevity than men --

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:16.000
is that unfolding the secrets of female physiology

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.000
and understanding that

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:21.000
is going to help men and women.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:24.000
So this is not a zero-sum game in anyway.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.000
Okay, so here's where we started.

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:30.000
And remember, paths crossed in 1984,

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.000
and more and more women

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.000
were dying of cardiovascular disease.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:37.000
What has happened in the last 15 years with this work?

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:39.000
We are bending the curve.

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:41.000
We're bending the curve.

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:44.000
So just like the breast cancer story,

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:47.000
doing research, getting awareness going,

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:50.000
it works, you just have to get it going.

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.000
Now are we happy with this?

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:55.000
We still have two to three more women dying for every man.

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.000
And I would propose,

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:59.000
with the better longevity

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:01.000
that women have overall,

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:03.000
that women probably should theoretically do better,

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:05.000
if we could just get treated.

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:08.000
So this is where we are,

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:10.000
but we have a long row to hoe.

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:12.000
We've worked on this for 15 years.

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:15.000
And I've told you, we've been working on male-pattern heart disease

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:17.000
for 50 years.

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:19.000
So we're 35 years behind.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:22.000
And we'd like to think it's not going to take 35 years.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:24.000
And in fact, it probably won't.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.000
But we cannot stop now.

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:29.000
Too many lives are at stake.

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:32.000
So what do we need to do?

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.000
You now, hopefully, have a more personal relationship

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:36.000
with your heart.

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:38.000
Women have heard the call

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:40.000
for breast cancer

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.000
and they have come out

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:44.000
for awareness campaigns.

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:47.000
The women are very good about getting mammograms now.

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:49.000
And women do fundraising.

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:51.000
Women participate.

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:53.000
They have put their money where their mouth is

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:56.000
and they have done advocacy and they have joined campaigns.

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:59.000
This is what we need to do with heart disease now.

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:01.000
And it's political.

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:04.000
Women's health, from a federal funding standpoint,

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:06.000
sometimes it's popular,

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:09.000
sometimes it's not so popular.

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:11.000
So we have these feast and famine cycles.

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:13.000
So I implore you

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:15.000
to join the Red Dress Campaign

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:17.000
in this fundraising.

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:19.000
Breast cancer, as we said,

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:21.000
kills women,

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:24.000
but heart disease kills a whole bunch more.

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:26.000
So if we can be as good as breast cancer

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:28.000
and give women this new charge,

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:30.000
we have a lot of lives to save.

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:32.000
So thank you for your attention.

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:38.000
(Applause)
