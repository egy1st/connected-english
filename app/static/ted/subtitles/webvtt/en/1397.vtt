00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
So my name is Taylor Wilson.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
I am 17 years old

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
and I am a nuclear physicist,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
which may be a little hard to believe, but I am.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
And I would like to make the case

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
that nuclear fusion

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
will be that point,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
that the bridge that T. Boone Pickens talked about

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
will get us to.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
So nuclear fusion is our energy future.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
And the second point,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
making the case that kids can really change the world.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
So you may ask --

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
(Applause)

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
You may ask me,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
well how do you know what our energy future is?

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Well I built a fusion reactor

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
when I was 14 years old.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
That is the inside of my nuclear fusion reactor.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
I started building this project

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
when I was about 12 or 13 years old.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
I decided I wanted to make a star.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
Now most of you are probably saying,

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
well there's no such thing as nuclear fusion.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
I don't see any nuclear power plants with fusion energy.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
Well it doesn't break even.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
It doesn't produce more energy out than I put in,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
but it still does some pretty cool stuff.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
And I assembled this in my garage,

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
and it now lives in the physics department

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
of the University of Nevada, Reno.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
And it slams together deuterium,

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
which is just hydrogen with an extra neutron in it.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
So this is similar to the reaction

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
of the proton chain that's going on inside the Sun.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
And I'm slamming it together so hard

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
that that hydrogen fuses together,

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
and in the process it has some byproducts,

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
and I utilize those byproducts.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000
So this previous year,

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.000
I won the Intel International Science and Engineering Fair.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
I developed a detector that replaces the current detectors

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
that Homeland Security has.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
For hundreds of dollars,

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
I've developed a system that exceeds the sensitivity

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
of detectors that are hundreds of thousands of dollars.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
I built this in my garage.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
(Applause)

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
And I've developed a system

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
to produce medical isotopes.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
Instead of requiring multi-million-dollar facilities

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
I've developed a device that, on a very small scale,

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
can produce these isotopes.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
So that's my fusion reactor in the background there.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
That is me at the control panel

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
of my fusion reactor.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
Oh, by the way, I make yellowcake in my garage,

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
so my nuclear program is as advanced as the Iranians.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
So maybe I don't want to admit to that.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
This is me at CERN in Geneva, Switzerland,

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.000
which is the preeminent particle physics laboratory in the world.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
And this is me with President Obama,

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
showing him my Homeland Security research.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:41.000
(Applause)

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
So in about seven years

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
of doing nuclear research,

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
I started out with a dream

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
to make a "star in a jar," a star in my garage,

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
and I ended up meeting the president

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
and developing things that I think can change the world,

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
and I think other kids can too.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
So thank you very much.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:11.000
(Applause)
