WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
I'm here to give you

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
your recommended dietary allowance

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
of poetry.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
And the way I'm going to do that

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
is present to you

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
five animations

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
of five of my poems.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
And let me just tell you a little bit of how that came about.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Because the mixing of those two media

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
is a sort of unnatural or unnecessary act.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
But when I was United States Poet Laureate --

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
and I love saying that.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
(Laughter)

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
It's a great way to start sentences.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
When I was him back then,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
I was approached by J. Walter Thompson, the ad company,

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
and they were hired

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
sort of by the Sundance Channel.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
And the idea was to have me record some of my poems

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
and then they would find animators

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
to animate them.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
And I was initially resistant,

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
because I always think

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
poetry can stand alone by itself.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
Attempts to put my poems to music

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
have had disastrous results,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
in all cases.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
And the poem, if it's written with the ear,

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
already has been set to its own verbal music

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
as it was composed.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
And surely, if you're reading a poem

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
that mentions a cow,

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
you don't need on the facing page

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
a drawing of a cow.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
I mean, let's let the reader do a little work.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
But I relented because it seemed like an interesting possibility,

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
and also I'm like a total cartoon junkie

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
since childhood.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
I think more influential

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000
than Emily Dickinson or Coleridge or Wordsworth

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
on my imagination

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
were Warner Brothers, Merrie Melodies

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
and Loony Tunes cartoons.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
Bugs Bunny is my muse.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.000
And this way poetry could find its way onto television of all places.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
And I'm pretty much all for poetry in public places --

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
poetry on buses, poetry on subways,

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000
on billboards, on cereal boxes.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000
When I was Poet Laureate, there I go again --

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
I can't help it, it's true --

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
(Laughter)

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
I created a poetry channel on Delta Airlines

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
that lasted for a couple of years.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
So you could tune into poetry as you were flying.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
And my sense is,

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000
it's a good thing to get poetry off the shelves

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
and more into public life.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000
Start a meeting with a poem. That would be an idea you might take with you.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000
When you get a poem on a billboard or on the radio

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
or on a cereal box or whatever,

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
it happens to you so suddenly

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
that you don't have time

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.000
to deploy your anti-poetry deflector shields

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000
that were installed in high school.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000
So let us start with the first one.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000
It's a little poem called "Budapest,"

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
and in it I reveal,

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
or pretend to reveal,

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.000
the secrets of the creative process.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000
(Video) Narration: "Budapest."

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000
My pen moves along the page

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
like the snout of a strange animal

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
shaped like a human arm

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000
and dressed in the sleeve

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
of a loose green sweater.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000
I watch it sniffing the paper ceaselessly,

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000
intent as any forager

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000
that has nothing on its mind

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.000
but the grubs and insects

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.000
that will allow it to live another day.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.000
It wants only to be here tomorrow,

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000
dressed perhaps

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000
in the sleeve of a plaid shirt,

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000
nose pressed against the page,

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.000
writing a few more dutiful lines

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000
while I gaze out the window

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000
and imagine Budapest

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000
or some other city

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.000
where I have never been.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.000
BC: So that makes it seem a little easier.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000
(Applause)

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.000
Writing is not actually as easy as that for me.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:06.000
But I like to pretend that it comes with ease.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000
One of my students came up after class, an introductory class,

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:14.000
and she said, "You know, poetry is harder than writing,"

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.000
which I found both erroneous and profound.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.000
(Laughter)

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.000
So I like to at least pretend it just flows out.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.000
A friend of mine has a slogan; he's another poet.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.000
He says that, "If at first you don't succeed,

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.000
hide all evidence you ever tried."

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000
(Laughter)

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.000
The next poem is also rather short.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.000
Poetry just says a few things in different ways.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.000
And I think you could boil this poem down to saying,

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.000
"Some days you eat the bear, other days the bear eats you."

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000
And it uses the imagery

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000
of dollhouse furniture.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.000
(Video) Narration: "Some Days."

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000
Some days

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.000
I put the people in their places at the table,

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000
bend their legs at the knees,

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000
if they come with that feature,

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:07.000
and fix them into the tiny wooden chairs.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.000
All afternoon they face one another,

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000
the man in the brown suit,

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000
the woman in the blue dress --

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:18.000
perfectly motionless, perfectly behaved.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000
But other days I am the one

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000
who is lifted up by the ribs

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:26.000
then lowered into the dining room of a dollhouse

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.000
to sit with the others at the long table.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000
Very funny.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.000
But how would you like it

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.000
if you never knew from one day to the next

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.000
if you were going to spend it

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.000
striding around like a vivid god,

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.000
your shoulders in the clouds,

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000
or sitting down there

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.000
amidst the wallpaper

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000
staring straight ahead

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:54.000
with your little plastic face?

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:01.000
(Applause)

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.000
BC: There's a horror movie in there somewhere.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.000
The next poem is called forgetfulness,

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000
and it's really just a kind of poetic essay

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:12.000
on the subject of mental slippage.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000
And the poem begins

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.000
with a certain species of forgetfulness

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.000
that someone called

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.000
literary amnesia,

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:25.000
in other words, forgetting the things that you have read.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000
(Video) Narration: "Forgetfulness."

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.000
The name of the author is the first to go,

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.000
followed obediently

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.000
by the title, the plot,

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000
the heartbreaking conclusion,

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.000
the entire novel,

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.000
which suddenly becomes one you have never read,

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.000
never even heard of.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.000
It is as if, one by one,

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.000
the memories you used to harbor

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:55.000
decided to retire to the southern hemisphere of the brain

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.000
to a little fishing village

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.000
where there are no phones.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000
Long ago,

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:04.000
you kissed the names of the nine muses good-bye

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.000
and you watched the quadratic equation

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.000
pack its bag.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.000
And even now,

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.000
as you memorize the order of the planets,

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.000
something else is slipping away,

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.000
a state flower perhaps,

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.000
the address of an uncle,

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.000
the capital of Paraguay.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.000
Whatever it is

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.000
you are struggling to remember,

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.000
it is not poised on the tip of your tongue,

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000
not even lurking

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000
in some obscure corner

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.000
of your spleen.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.000
It has floated away

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.000
down a dark mythological river

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:41.000
whose name begins with an L

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.000
as far as you can recall,

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:46.000
well on your own way to oblivion

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.000
where you will join those

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.000
who have forgotten even how to swim

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:53.000
and how to ride a bicycle.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:56.000
No wonder you rise in the middle of the night

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:59.000
to look up the date of a famous battle

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.000
in a book on war.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.000
No wonder the Moon in the window

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.000
seems to have drifted out of a love poem

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:10.000
that you used to know by heart.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:20.000
(Applause)

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.000
BC: The next poem is called "The Country"

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.000
and it's based on,

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000
when I was in college

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:29.000
I met a classmate who remains to be a friend of mine.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000
He lived, and still does, in rural Vermont.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.000
I lived in New York City.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.000
And we would visit each other.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.000
And when I would go up to the country,

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:40.000
he would teach me things like deer hunting,

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:43.000
which meant getting lost with a gun basically --

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.000
(Laughter)

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.000
and trout fishing and stuff like that.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.000
And then he'd come down to New York City

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000
and I'd teach him what I knew,

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.000
which was largely smoking and drinking.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.000
(Laughter)

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:58.000
And in that way we traded lore with each other.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.000
The poem that's coming up

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.000
is based on him trying to tell me a little something

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.000
about a domestic point of etiquette

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.000
in country living

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.000
that I had a very hard time, at first, processing.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.000
It's called "The Country."

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:14.000
(Video) Narration: "The Country."

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.000
I wondered about you

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.000
when you told me never to leave

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:21.000
a box of wooden strike-anywhere matches

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:24.000
just lying around the house,

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.000
because the mice might get into them

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.000
and start a fire.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:31.000
But your face was absolutely straight

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.000
when you twisted the lid down

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.000
on the round tin

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:38.000
where the matches, you said, are always stowed.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.000
Who could sleep that night?

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.000
Who could whisk away the thought

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.000
of the one unlikely mouse

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:48.000
padding along a cold water pipe

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.000
behind the floral wallpaper,

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.000
gripping a single wooden match

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:55.000
between the needles of his teeth?

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:58.000
Who could not see him rounding a corner,

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:01.000
the blue tip scratching against rough-hewn beam,

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.000
the sudden flare

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:07.000
and the creature, for one bright, shining moment,

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.000
suddenly thrust ahead of his time --

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.000
now a fire-starter,

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.000
now a torch-bearer

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.000
in a forgotten ritual,

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:17.000
little brown druid

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.000
illuminating some ancient night?

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:22.000
And who could fail to notice,

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.000
lit up in the blazing insulation,

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.000
the tiny looks of wonderment

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:29.000
on the faces of his fellow mice --

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.000
one-time inhabitants

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:35.000
of what once was your house in the country?

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:38.000
(Applause)

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.000
BC: Thank you.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.000
(Applause)

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:45.000
Thank you. And the last poem is called "The Dead."

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.000
I wrote this after a friend's funeral,

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.000
but not so much about the friend as something the eulogist kept saying,

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.000
as all eulogists tend to do,

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:54.000
which is how happy the deceased would be

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.000
to look down and see all of us assembled.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:59.000
And that to me was a bad start to the afterlife,

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:02.000
having to witness your own funeral and feel gratified.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:06.000
So the little poem is called "The Dead."

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.000
(Video) Narration: "The Dead."

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:11.000
The dead are always looking down on us,

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.000
they say.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:16.000
While we are putting on our shoes or making a sandwich,

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.000
they are looking down

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:21.000
through the glass-bottom boats of heaven

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.000
as they row themselves slowly

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.000
through eternity.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.000
They watch the tops of our heads

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.000
moving below on Earth.

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.000
And when we lie down

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:33.000
in a field or on a couch,

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.000
drugged perhaps

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:38.000
by the hum of a warm afternoon,

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:41.000
they think we are looking back at them,

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:43.000
which makes them lift their oars

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.000
and fall silent

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:48.000
and wait like parents

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:51.000
for us to close our eyes.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:12:00.000
(Applause)

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.000
BC: I'm not sure if other poems will be animated.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.000
It took a long time --

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:07.000
I mean, it's rather uncommon to have this marriage --

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:09.000
a long time to put those two together.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:11.000
But then again, it took us a long time

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.000
to put the wheel and the suitcase together.

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:16.000
(Laughter)

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:19.000
I mean, we had the wheel for some time.

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:22.000
And schlepping is an ancient and honorable art.

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:25.000
(Laughter)

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.000
I just have time

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:30.000
to read a more recent poem to you.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:33.000
If it has a subject,

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:35.000
the subject is adolescence.

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:37.000
And it's addressed to a certain person.

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:43.000
It's called "To My Favorite 17-Year-Old High School Girl."

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:46.000
"Do you realize that if you had started building the Parthenon

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.000
on the day you were born,

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:51.000
you would be all done in only one more year?

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.000
Of course, you couldn't have done that all alone.

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.000
So never mind;

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.000
you're fine just being yourself.

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:00.000
You're loved for just being you.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.000
But did you know that at your age

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:07.000
Judy Garland was pulling down 150,000 dollars a picture,

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:11.000
Joan of Arc was leading the French army to victory

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:14.000
and Blaise Pascal had cleaned up his room --

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:18.000
no wait, I mean he had invented the calculator?

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:20.000
Of course, there will be time for all that

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.000
later in your life,

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.000
after you come out of your room

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.000
and begin to blossom,

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:30.000
or at least pick up all your socks.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.000
For some reason I keep remembering

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.000
that Lady Jane Grey was queen of England

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:37.000
when she was only 15.

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:40.000
But then she was beheaded, so never mind her as a role model.

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:43.000
(Laughter)

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:45.000
A few centuries later,

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.000
when he was your age,

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:51.000
Franz Schubert was doing the dishes for his family,

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:53.000
but that did not keep him

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:56.000
from composing two symphonies, four operas

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:59.000
and two complete masses as a youngster.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:01.000
(Laughter)

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:03.000
But of course, that was in Austria

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:06.000
at the height of Romantic lyricism,

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:08.000
not here in the suburbs of Cleveland.

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:10.000
(Laughter)

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:12.000
Frankly, who cares

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:15.000
if Annie Oakley was a crack shot at 15

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:19.000
or if Maria Callas debuted as Tosca at 17?

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:22.000
We think you're special just being you --

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:25.000
playing with your food and staring into space.

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:28.000
(Laughter)

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.000
By the way,

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:33.000
I lied about Schubert doing the dishes,

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:36.000
but that doesn't mean he never helped out around the house."

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:38.000
(Laughter)

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:40.000
(Applause)

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:43.000
Thank you. Thank you.

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:48.000
(Applause)

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:50.000
Thanks.

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:52.000
(Applause)
