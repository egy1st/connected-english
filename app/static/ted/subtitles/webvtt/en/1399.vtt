WEBVTT

00:00:00.578 --> 00:00:02.601
Look, I had second thoughts, really,

00:00:02.601 --> 00:00:04.636
about whether I could talk about this

00:00:04.636 --> 00:00:07.676
to such a vital and alive audience as you guys.

00:00:07.676 --> 00:00:10.266
Then I remembered the quote from Gloria Steinem,

00:00:10.266 --> 00:00:11.905
which goes,

00:00:11.905 --> 00:00:13.836
"The truth will set you free,

00:00:13.836 --> 00:00:17.795
but first it will piss you off." (Laughter)

00:00:17.795 --> 00:00:20.063
So -- (Laughter)

00:00:20.063 --> 00:00:22.187
So with that in mind, I'm going to set about

00:00:22.187 --> 00:00:23.778
trying to do those things here,

00:00:23.778 --> 00:00:25.640
and talk about dying in the 21st century.

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:28.040
Now the first thing that will piss you off, undoubtedly,

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:30.659
is that all of us are, in fact, going to die

00:00:30.659 --> 00:00:31.733
in the 21st century.

00:00:31.733 --> 00:00:34.123
There will be no exceptions to that.

00:00:34.123 --> 00:00:36.780
There are, apparently, about one in eight of you

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.304
who think you're immortal, on surveys, but --

00:00:39.304 --> 00:00:41.482
(Laughter)

00:00:41.482 --> 00:00:46.095
Unfortunately, that isn't going to happen.

00:00:46.095 --> 00:00:47.748
While I give this talk, in the next 10 minutes,

00:00:47.748 --> 00:00:51.244
a hundred million of my cells will die,

00:00:51.244 --> 00:00:53.838
and over the course of today, 2,000 of my brain cells

00:00:53.838 --> 00:00:55.979
will die and never come back,

00:00:55.979 --> 00:00:58.060
so you could argue that the dying process

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:00.138
starts pretty early in the piece.

00:01:00.138 --> 00:01:02.252
Anyway, the second thing I want to say about dying in the

00:01:02.252 --> 00:01:04.617
21st century, apart from it's going to happen to everybody,

00:01:04.617 --> 00:01:07.233
is it's shaping up to be a bit of a train wreck

00:01:07.233 --> 00:01:09.578
for most of us,

00:01:09.578 --> 00:01:12.547
unless we do something to try and reclaim this process

00:01:12.547 --> 00:01:16.264
from the rather inexorable trajectory that it's currently on.

00:01:16.264 --> 00:01:18.072
So there you go. That's the truth.

00:01:18.072 --> 00:01:19.503
No doubt that will piss you off, and now let's see

00:01:19.503 --> 00:01:22.479
whether we can set you free. I don't promise anything.

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:25.062
Now, as you heard in the intro, I work in intensive care,

00:01:25.062 --> 00:01:28.166
and I think I've kind of lived through the heyday

00:01:28.166 --> 00:01:30.173
of intensive care. It's been a ride, man.

00:01:30.173 --> 00:01:31.373
This has been fantastic.

00:01:31.373 --> 00:01:32.528
We have machines that go ping.

00:01:32.528 --> 00:01:34.838
There's many of them up there.

00:01:34.838 --> 00:01:37.582
And we have some wizard technology which I think

00:01:37.582 --> 00:01:40.094
has worked really well, and over the course of the time

00:01:40.094 --> 00:01:42.166
I've worked in intensive care, the death rate

00:01:42.166 --> 00:01:44.536
for males in Australia has halved,

00:01:44.536 --> 00:01:46.155
and intensive care has had something to do with that.

00:01:46.155 --> 00:01:48.163
Certainly, a lot of the technologies that we use

00:01:48.163 --> 00:01:50.383
have got something to do with that.

00:01:50.383 --> 00:01:52.887
So we have had tremendous success, and we kind of

00:01:52.887 --> 00:01:55.241
got caught up in our own success quite a bit,

00:01:55.241 --> 00:01:58.865
and we started using expressions like "lifesaving."

00:01:58.865 --> 00:02:00.999
I really apologize to everybody for doing that,

00:02:00.999 --> 00:02:02.229
because obviously, we don't.

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:04.757
What we do is prolong people's lives,

00:02:04.757 --> 00:02:06.858
and delay death,

00:02:06.858 --> 00:02:09.703
and redirect death, but we can't, strictly speaking,

00:02:09.703 --> 00:02:12.558
save lives on any sort of permanent basis.

00:02:12.558 --> 00:02:14.543
And what's really happened over the period of time

00:02:14.543 --> 00:02:17.182
that I've been working in intensive care is that

00:02:17.182 --> 00:02:20.752
the people whose lives we started saving back in the '70s,

00:02:20.752 --> 00:02:25.230
'80s, and '90s, are now coming to die in the 21st century

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:28.830
of diseases that we no longer have the answers to

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:31.340
in quite the way we did then.

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:33.215
So what's happening now is there's been a big shift

00:02:33.215 --> 00:02:35.022
in the way that people die,

00:02:35.022 --> 00:02:37.293
and most of what they're dying of now isn't as amenable

00:02:37.293 --> 00:02:40.119
to what we can do as what it used to be like

00:02:40.119 --> 00:02:44.030
when I was doing this in the '80s and '90s.

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:46.894
So we kind of got a bit caught up with this,

00:02:46.894 --> 00:02:49.927
and we haven't really squared with you guys about

00:02:49.927 --> 00:02:53.982
what's really happening now, and it's about time we did.

00:02:53.982 --> 00:02:57.373
I kind of woke up to this bit in the late '90s

00:02:57.373 --> 00:02:59.467
when I met this guy.

00:02:59.467 --> 00:03:03.824
This guy is called Jim, Jim Smith, and he looked like this.

00:03:03.824 --> 00:03:06.127
I was called down to the ward to see him.

00:03:06.127 --> 00:03:08.372
His is the little hand.

00:03:08.372 --> 00:03:09.758
I was called down to the ward to see him

00:03:09.758 --> 00:03:10.852
by a respiratory physician.

00:03:10.852 --> 00:03:13.028
He said, "Look, there's a guy down here.

00:03:13.028 --> 00:03:14.628
He's got pneumonia,

00:03:14.628 --> 00:03:17.133
and he looks like he needs intensive care.

00:03:17.133 --> 00:03:19.207
His daughter's here and she wants everything possible

00:03:19.207 --> 00:03:21.738
to be done."

00:03:21.738 --> 00:03:24.357
Which is a familiar phrase to us.

00:03:24.357 --> 00:03:26.188
So I go down to the ward and see Jim,

00:03:26.188 --> 00:03:27.873
and his skin his translucent like this.

00:03:27.873 --> 00:03:30.123
You can see his bones through the skin.

00:03:30.123 --> 00:03:31.661
He's very, very thin,

00:03:31.661 --> 00:03:35.043
and he is, indeed, very sick with pneumonia,

00:03:35.043 --> 00:03:36.524
and he's too sick to talk to me,

00:03:36.524 --> 00:03:41.674
so I talk to his daughter Kathleen, and I say to her,

00:03:41.674 --> 00:03:44.638
"Did you and Jim ever talk about

00:03:44.638 --> 00:03:46.321
what you would want done

00:03:46.321 --> 00:03:48.335
if he ended up in this kind of situation?"

00:03:48.335 --> 00:03:52.064
And she looked at me and said, "No, of course not!"

00:03:52.064 --> 00:03:57.124
I thought, "Okay. Take this steady."

00:03:57.124 --> 00:03:59.968
And I got talking to her, and after a while, she said to me,

00:03:59.968 --> 00:04:02.971
"You know, we always thought there'd be time."

00:04:02.971 --> 00:04:06.737
Jim was 94. (Laughter)

00:04:06.737 --> 00:04:09.271
And I realized that something wasn't happening here.

00:04:09.271 --> 00:04:10.595
There wasn't this dialogue going on

00:04:10.595 --> 00:04:13.248
that I imagined was happening.

00:04:13.248 --> 00:04:16.255
So a group of us started doing survey work,

00:04:16.255 --> 00:04:18.475
and we looked at four and a half thousand nursing home

00:04:18.475 --> 00:04:21.815
residents in Newcastle, in the Newcastle area,

00:04:21.815 --> 00:04:24.762
and discovered that only one in a hundred of them

00:04:24.762 --> 00:04:27.827
had a plan about what to do when their hearts stopped beating.

00:04:27.827 --> 00:04:28.966
One in a hundred.

00:04:28.966 --> 00:04:32.307
And only one in 500 of them had plan about what to do

00:04:32.307 --> 00:04:35.404
if they became seriously ill.

00:04:35.404 --> 00:04:38.164
And I realized, of course, this dialogue

00:04:38.164 --> 00:04:42.800
is definitely not occurring in the public at large.

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:44.278
Now, I work in acute care.

00:04:44.278 --> 00:04:46.383
This is John Hunter Hospital.

00:04:46.383 --> 00:04:50.384
And I thought, surely, we do better than that.

00:04:50.384 --> 00:04:53.380
So a colleague of mine from nursing called Lisa Shaw and I

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:55.896
went through hundreds and hundreds of sets of notes

00:04:55.896 --> 00:04:57.169
in the medical records department

00:04:57.169 --> 00:04:59.790
looking at whether there was any sign at all

00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:02.218
that anybody had had any conversation about

00:05:02.218 --> 00:05:04.071
what might happen to them if the treatment they were

00:05:04.071 --> 00:05:07.415
receiving was unsuccessful to the point that they would die.

00:05:07.415 --> 00:05:10.356
And we didn't find a single record of any preference

00:05:10.356 --> 00:05:14.200
about goals, treatments or outcomes from any

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:18.770
of the sets of notes initiated by a doctor or by a patient.

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:21.487
So we started to realize

00:05:21.487 --> 00:05:23.688
that we had a problem,

00:05:23.688 --> 00:05:28.711
and the problem is more serious because of this.

00:05:28.711 --> 00:05:32.013
What we know is that obviously we are all going to die,

00:05:32.013 --> 00:05:34.678
but how we die is actually really important,

00:05:34.678 --> 00:05:38.233
obviously not just to us, but also to how that

00:05:38.233 --> 00:05:41.367
features in the lives of all the people who live on afterwards.

00:05:41.367 --> 00:05:43.688
How we die lives on in the minds of everybody

00:05:43.688 --> 00:05:46.805
who survives us, and

00:05:46.805 --> 00:05:50.537
the stress created in families by dying is enormous,

00:05:50.537 --> 00:05:53.223
and in fact you get seven times as much stress by dying

00:05:53.223 --> 00:05:55.960
in intensive care as by dying just about anywhere else,

00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:59.038
so dying in intensive care is not your top option

00:05:59.038 --> 00:06:01.496
if you've got a choice.

00:06:01.496 --> 00:06:03.665
And, if that wasn't bad enough, of course,

00:06:03.665 --> 00:06:06.313
all of this is rapidly progressing towards the fact that

00:06:06.313 --> 00:06:08.665
many of you, in fact, about one in 10 of you at this point,

00:06:08.665 --> 00:06:10.115
will die in intensive care.

00:06:10.115 --> 00:06:11.449
In the U.S., it's one in five.

00:06:11.449 --> 00:06:15.199
In Miami, it's three out of five people die in intensive care.

00:06:15.199 --> 00:06:17.264
So this is the sort of momentum

00:06:17.264 --> 00:06:19.552
that we've got at the moment.

00:06:19.552 --> 00:06:22.097
The reason why this is all happening is due to this,

00:06:22.097 --> 00:06:23.399
and I do have to take you through what this is about.

00:06:23.399 --> 00:06:25.364
These are the four ways to go.

00:06:25.364 --> 00:06:28.229
So one of these will happen to all of us.

00:06:28.229 --> 00:06:30.759
The ones you may know most about are the ones

00:06:30.759 --> 00:06:33.605
that are becoming increasingly of historical interest:

00:06:33.605 --> 00:06:35.022
sudden death.

00:06:35.022 --> 00:06:36.467
It's quite likely in an audience this size

00:06:36.467 --> 00:06:39.018
this won't happen to anybody here.

00:06:39.018 --> 00:06:40.748
Sudden death has become very rare.

00:06:40.748 --> 00:06:43.203
The death of Little Nell and Cordelia and all that sort of stuff

00:06:43.203 --> 00:06:44.876
just doesn't happen anymore.

00:06:44.876 --> 00:06:47.293
The dying process of those with terminal illness

00:06:47.293 --> 00:06:48.325
that we've just seen

00:06:48.325 --> 00:06:49.940
occurs to younger people.

00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:52.790
By the time you've reached 80, this is unlikely to happen to you.

00:06:52.790 --> 00:06:56.205
Only one in 10 people who are over 80 will die of cancer.

00:06:56.205 --> 00:07:01.040
The big growth industry are these.

00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:04.291
What you die of is increasing organ failure,

00:07:04.291 --> 00:07:06.526
with your respiratory, cardiac, renal,

00:07:06.526 --> 00:07:08.306
whatever organs packing up. Each of these

00:07:08.306 --> 00:07:10.909
would be an admission to an acute care hospital,

00:07:10.909 --> 00:07:12.878
at the end of which, or at some point during which,

00:07:12.878 --> 00:07:15.054
somebody says, enough is enough, and we stop.

00:07:15.054 --> 00:07:17.622
And this one's the biggest growth industry of all,

00:07:17.622 --> 00:07:20.197
and at least six out of 10 of the people in this room

00:07:20.197 --> 00:07:22.759
will die in this form, which is

00:07:22.759 --> 00:07:26.653
the dwindling of capacity

00:07:26.653 --> 00:07:28.972
with increasing frailty,

00:07:28.972 --> 00:07:31.222
and frailty's an inevitable part of aging,

00:07:31.222 --> 00:07:33.775
and increasing frailty is in fact the main thing

00:07:33.775 --> 00:07:34.824
that people die of now,

00:07:34.824 --> 00:07:36.952
and the last few years, or the last year of your life

00:07:36.952 --> 00:07:40.967
is spent with a great deal of disability, unfortunately.

00:07:40.967 --> 00:07:44.351
Enjoying it so far? (Laughs)

00:07:44.351 --> 00:07:47.504
(Laughter)

00:07:47.504 --> 00:07:50.932
Sorry, I just feel such a, I feel such a Cassandra here.

00:07:50.932 --> 00:07:56.090
(Laughter)

00:07:56.090 --> 00:07:57.149
What can I say that's positive? What's positive is

00:07:57.149 --> 00:07:59.564
that this is happening at very great age, now.

00:07:59.564 --> 00:08:02.309
We are all, most of us, living to reach this point.

00:08:02.309 --> 00:08:04.197
You know, historically, we didn't do that.

00:08:04.197 --> 00:08:05.666
This is what happens to you

00:08:05.666 --> 00:08:08.189
when you live to be a great age,

00:08:08.189 --> 00:08:10.078
and unfortunately, increasing longevity does mean

00:08:10.078 --> 00:08:12.005
more old age, not more youth.

00:08:12.005 --> 00:08:18.098
I'm sorry to say that. (Laughter)

00:08:18.098 --> 00:08:19.895
What we did, anyway, look, what we did,

00:08:19.895 --> 00:08:21.422
we didn't just take this lying down

00:08:21.422 --> 00:08:22.924
at John Hunter Hospital and elsewhere.

00:08:22.924 --> 00:08:24.546
We've started a whole series of projects

00:08:24.546 --> 00:08:27.542
to try and look about whether we could, in fact, involve

00:08:27.542 --> 00:08:31.036
people much more in the way that things happen to them.

00:08:31.036 --> 00:08:32.268
But we realized, of course, that we are dealing

00:08:32.268 --> 00:08:34.612
with cultural issues,

00:08:34.612 --> 00:08:36.471
and this is, I love this Klimt painting,

00:08:36.471 --> 00:08:38.676
because the more you look at it, the more you kind of get

00:08:38.676 --> 00:08:40.695
the whole issue that's going on here,

00:08:40.695 --> 00:08:44.213
which is clearly the separation of death from the living,

00:08:44.213 --> 00:08:46.093
and the fear — Like, if you actually look,

00:08:46.093 --> 00:08:47.268
there's one woman there

00:08:47.268 --> 00:08:49.187
who has her eyes open.

00:08:49.187 --> 00:08:50.872
She's the one he's looking at,

00:08:50.872 --> 00:08:54.100
and [she's] the one he's coming for. Can you see that?

00:08:54.100 --> 00:08:55.626
She looks terrified.

00:08:55.626 --> 00:08:57.319
It's an amazing picture.

00:08:57.319 --> 00:08:59.540
Anyway, we had a major cultural issue.

00:08:59.540 --> 00:09:01.524
Clearly, people didn't want us to talk about death,

00:09:01.524 --> 00:09:03.019
or, we thought that.

00:09:03.019 --> 00:09:04.966
So with loads of funding from the Federal Government

00:09:04.966 --> 00:09:06.386
and the local Health Service, we introduced a thing

00:09:06.386 --> 00:09:09.284
at John Hunter called Respecting Patient Choices.

00:09:09.284 --> 00:09:12.133
We trained hundreds of people to go to the wards

00:09:12.133 --> 00:09:15.276
and talk to people about the fact that they would die,

00:09:15.276 --> 00:09:17.562
and what would they prefer under those circumstances.

00:09:17.562 --> 00:09:21.081
They loved it. The families and the patients, they loved it.

00:09:21.081 --> 00:09:23.541
Ninety-eight percent of people really thought

00:09:23.541 --> 00:09:24.995
this just should have been normal practice,

00:09:24.995 --> 00:09:27.378
and that this is how things should work.

00:09:27.378 --> 00:09:29.316
And when they expressed wishes,

00:09:29.316 --> 00:09:31.289
all of those wishes came true, as it were.

00:09:31.289 --> 00:09:33.269
We were able to make that happen for them.

00:09:33.269 --> 00:09:35.519
But then, when the funding ran out,

00:09:35.519 --> 00:09:37.604
we went back to look six months later,

00:09:37.604 --> 00:09:39.871
and everybody had stopped again,

00:09:39.871 --> 00:09:43.064
and nobody was having these conversations anymore.

00:09:43.064 --> 00:09:45.117
So that was really kind of heartbreaking for us,

00:09:45.117 --> 00:09:47.834
because we thought this was going to really take off.

00:09:47.834 --> 00:09:51.805
The cultural issue had reasserted itself.

00:09:51.805 --> 00:09:52.960
So here's the pitch:

00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:57.046
I think it's important that we don't just get on this freeway

00:09:57.046 --> 00:09:59.545
to ICU without thinking hard about whether or not

00:09:59.545 --> 00:10:01.338
that's where we all want to end up,

00:10:01.338 --> 00:10:03.474
particularly as we become older and increasingly frail

00:10:03.474 --> 00:10:07.128
and ICU has less and less and less to offer us.

00:10:07.128 --> 00:10:09.458
There has to be a little side road

00:10:09.458 --> 00:10:13.933
off there for people who don't want to go on that track.

00:10:13.933 --> 00:10:16.569
And I have one small idea,

00:10:16.569 --> 00:10:21.018
and one big idea about what could happen.

00:10:21.018 --> 00:10:22.079
And this is the small idea.

00:10:22.079 --> 00:10:24.860
The small idea is, let's all of us

00:10:24.860 --> 00:10:28.796
engage more with this in the way that Jason has illustrated.

00:10:28.796 --> 00:10:30.849
Why can't we have these kinds of conversations

00:10:30.849 --> 00:10:32.170
with our own elders

00:10:32.170 --> 00:10:34.960
and people who might be approaching this?

00:10:34.960 --> 00:10:36.794
There are a couple of things you can do.

00:10:36.794 --> 00:10:38.925
One of them is, you can,

00:10:38.925 --> 00:10:41.839
just ask this simple question. This question never fails.

00:10:41.839 --> 00:10:45.594
"In the event that you became too sick to speak for yourself,

00:10:45.594 --> 00:10:48.527
who would you like to speak for you?"

00:10:48.527 --> 00:10:50.441
That's a really important question to ask people,

00:10:50.441 --> 00:10:52.464
because giving people the control over who that is

00:10:52.464 --> 00:10:55.772
produces an amazing outcome.

00:10:55.772 --> 00:10:56.918
The second thing you can say is,

00:10:56.918 --> 00:10:58.416
"Have you spoken to that person

00:10:58.416 --> 00:11:00.336
about the things that are important to you

00:11:00.336 --> 00:11:04.490
so that we've got a better idea of what it is we can do?"

00:11:04.490 --> 00:11:07.012
So that's the little idea.

00:11:07.012 --> 00:11:08.506
The big idea, I think, is more political.

00:11:08.506 --> 00:11:10.457
I think we have to get onto this.

00:11:10.457 --> 00:11:13.519
I suggested we should have Occupy Death.

00:11:13.519 --> 00:11:16.304
(Laughter)

00:11:16.304 --> 00:11:18.874
My wife said, "Yeah, right, sit-ins in the mortuary.

00:11:18.874 --> 00:11:21.453
Yeah, yeah. Sure." (Laughter)

00:11:21.453 --> 00:11:23.318
So that one didn't really run,

00:11:23.318 --> 00:11:24.988
but I was very struck by this.

00:11:24.988 --> 00:11:26.701
Now, I'm an aging hippie.

00:11:26.701 --> 00:11:29.198
I don't know, I don't think I look like that anymore, but

00:11:29.198 --> 00:11:31.698
I had, two of my kids were born at home in the '80s

00:11:31.698 --> 00:11:35.166
when home birth was a big thing, and we baby boomers

00:11:35.166 --> 00:11:37.862
are used to taking charge of the situation,

00:11:37.862 --> 00:11:41.260
so if you just replace all these words of birth,

00:11:41.260 --> 00:11:44.341
I like "Peace, Love, Natural Death" as an option.

00:11:44.341 --> 00:11:45.857
I do think we have to get political

00:11:45.857 --> 00:11:48.455
and start to reclaim this process from

00:11:48.455 --> 00:11:50.422
the medicalized model in which it's going.

00:11:50.422 --> 00:11:52.462
Now, listen, that sounds like a pitch for euthanasia.

00:11:52.462 --> 00:11:54.654
I want to make it absolutely crystal clear to you all,

00:11:54.654 --> 00:11:57.318
I hate euthanasia. I think it's a sideshow.

00:11:57.318 --> 00:11:59.505
I don't think euthanasia matters.

00:11:59.505 --> 00:12:01.656
I actually think that,

00:12:01.656 --> 00:12:04.205
in places like Oregon,

00:12:04.205 --> 00:12:07.677
where you can have physician-assisted suicide,

00:12:07.677 --> 00:12:09.894
you take a poisonous dose of stuff,

00:12:09.894 --> 00:12:11.770
only half a percent of people ever do that.

00:12:11.770 --> 00:12:14.476
I'm more interested in what happens to the 99.5 percent

00:12:14.476 --> 00:12:16.232
of people who don't want to do that.

00:12:16.232 --> 00:12:18.566
I think most people don't want to be dead,

00:12:18.566 --> 00:12:20.663
but I do think most people want to have some control

00:12:20.663 --> 00:12:23.405
over how their dying process proceeds.

00:12:23.405 --> 00:12:24.545
So I'm an opponent of euthanasia,

00:12:24.545 --> 00:12:27.198
but I do think we have to give people back some control.

00:12:27.198 --> 00:12:30.671
It deprives euthanasia of its oxygen supply.

00:12:30.671 --> 00:12:32.023
I think we should be looking at stopping

00:12:32.023 --> 00:12:33.062
the want for euthanasia,

00:12:33.062 --> 00:12:37.757
not for making it illegal or legal or worrying about it at all.

00:12:37.757 --> 00:12:41.333
This is a quote from Dame Cicely Saunders,

00:12:41.333 --> 00:12:42.702
whom I met when I was a medical student.

00:12:42.702 --> 00:12:45.581
She founded the hospice movement.

00:12:45.581 --> 00:12:47.772
And she said, "You matter because you are,

00:12:47.772 --> 00:12:50.294
and you matter to the last moment of your life."

00:12:50.294 --> 00:12:52.551
And I firmly believe that

00:12:52.551 --> 00:12:55.637
that's the message that we have to carry forward.

00:12:55.637 --> 00:12:58.656
Thank you. (Applause)
