Imagine spending seven years at MIT and research laboratories,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
only to find out that you're a performance artist.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
(Laughter)

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
I'm also a software engineer,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
and I make lots of different kinds of art with the computer.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
And I think the main thing that I'm interested in

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
is trying to find a way of

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
making the computer into a personal mode of expression.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.000
And many of you out there are the heads of Macromedia and Microsoft,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
and in a way those are my bane:

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
I think there's a great homogenizing force

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:42.000
that software imposes on people and limits the way they think

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
about what's possible on the computer.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
Of course, it's also a great liberating force that makes possible,

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
you know, publishing and so forth, and standards, and so on.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000
But, in a way, the computer makes possible much more

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
than what most people think, and my art has just been about

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
trying to find a personal way of using the computer,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
and so I end up writing software to do that.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
Chris has asked me to do a short performance,

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
and so I'm going to take just this time -- maybe 10 minutes --

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
to do that, and hopefully at the end have just a moment

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
to show you a couple of my other projects in video form.

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.000
Thank you.

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:55.000
(Applause)

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.000
We've got about a minute left.

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:03.000
I'd just like to show a clip from a most recent project.

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:06.000
I did a performance with two singers

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:09.000
who specialize in making strange noises with their mouths.

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:12.000
And this just came off last September at ARS Electronica;

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.000
we repeated it in England.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:17.000
And the idea is to visualize their speech and song behind them

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:18.000
with a large screen.

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:20.000
We used a computer vision tracking system

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.000
in order to know where they were.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:23.000
And since we know where their heads are,

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:25.000
and we have a wireless mic on them

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:26.000
that we're processing the sound from,

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:28.000
we're able to create visualizations

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:31.000
which are linked very tightly to what they're doing with their speech.

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.000
This will take about 30 seconds or so.

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:39.000
He's making a, kind of, cheek-flapping sound.

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:20.000
Well, suffice it to say it's not all like that, but that's part of it.

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:23.000
Thanks very much. There's always lots more.

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:25.000
I'm overtime, so I just wanted to say you can, if you're in New York,

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:27.000
you can check out my work at the Whitney Biennial next week,

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:30.000
and also at Bitforms Gallery in Chelsea.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.000
And with that, I think I should give up the stage,

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.000
so, thank you so much.
