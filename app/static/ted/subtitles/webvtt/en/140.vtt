00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
I told you three things last year.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
I told you that the statistics of the world

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
have not been made properly available.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Because of that, we still have the old mindset

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
of developing in industrialized countries, which is wrong.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
And that animated graphics can make a difference.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Things are changing

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
and today, on the United Nations Statistic Division Home Page,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
it says, by first of May, full access to the databases.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
(Applause)

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
And if I could share the image with you on the screen.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:39.000
So three things have happened.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
U.N. opened their statistic databases,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
and we have a new version of the software

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
up working as a beta on the net,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
so you don't have to download it any longer.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
And let me repeat what you saw last year.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.000
The bubbles are the countries.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000
Here you have the fertility rate -- the number of children per woman --

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
and there you have the length of life in years.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
This is 1950 -- those were the industrialized countries,

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:06.000
those were developing countries.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
At that time there was a "we" and "them."

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
There was a huge difference in the world.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.000
But then it changed, and it went on quite well.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:15.000
And this is what happens.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
You can see how China is the red, big bubble.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:20.000
The blue there is India.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
And they go over all this -- I'm going to try to be

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
a little more serious this year in showing you

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
how things really changed.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
And it's Africa that stands out as the problem down here, doesn't it?

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
Large families still, and the HIV epidemic

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
brought down the countries like this.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
This is more or less what we saw last year,

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
and this is how it will go on into the future.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
And I will talk on, is this possible?

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
Because you see now, I presented statistics that don't exist.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
Because this is where we are.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
Will it be possible that this will happen?

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
I cover my lifetime here, you know?

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
I expect to live 100 years.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
And this is where we are today.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:07.000
Now could we look here instead at the economic situation in the world?

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:13.000
And I would like to show that against child survival.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.000
We'll swap the axis.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.000
Here you have child mortality -- that is, survival --

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
four kids dying there, 200 dying there.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
And this is GDP per capita on this axis.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000
And this was 2007.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000
And if I go back in time, I've added some historical statistics --

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:38.000
here we go, here we go, here we go -- not so much statistics 100 years ago.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000
Some countries still had statistics.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
We are looking down in the archive,

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.000
and when we are down into 1820,

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.000
there is only Austria and Sweden that can produce numbers.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000
(Laughter)

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.000
But they were down here. They had 1,000 dollars per person per year.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
And they lost one-fifth of their kids before their first birthday.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000
So this is what happens in the world, if we play the entire world.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000
How they got slowly richer and richer,

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.000
and they add statistics.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
Isn't it beautiful when they get statistics?

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000
You see the importance of that?

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
And here, children don't live longer.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.000
The last century, 1870, was bad for the kids in Europe,

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000
because most of this statistics is Europe.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.000
It was only by the turn of the century

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.000
that more than 90 percent of the children survived their first year.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.000
This is India coming up, with the first data from India.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:34.000
And this is the United States moving away here, earning more money.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:39.000
And we will soon see China coming up in the very far end corner here.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000
And it moves up with Mao Tse-Tung getting health,

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:42.000
not getting so rich.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000
There he died, then Deng Xiaoping brings money.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.000
It moves this way over here.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000
And the bubbles keep moving up there,

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000
and this is what the world looks like today.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:57.000
(Applause)

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
Let us have a look at the United States.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000
We have a function here -- I can tell the world, "Stay where you are."

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.000
And I take the United States -- we still want to see the background --

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.000
I put them up like this, and now we go backwards.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.000
And we can see that the United States

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.000
goes to the right of the mainstream.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000
They are on the money side all the time.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:24.000
And down in 1915, the United States was a neighbor of India --

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000
present, contemporary India.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000
And that means United States was richer,

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:33.000
but lost more kids than India is doing today, proportionally.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.000
And look here -- compare to the Philippines of today.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.000
The Philippines of today has almost the same economy

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000
as the United States during the First World War.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:47.000
But we have to bring United States forward quite a while

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.000
to find the same health of the United States

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:51.000
as we have in the Philippines.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.000
About 1957 here, the health of the United States

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000
is the same as the Philippines.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000
And this is the drama of this world which many call globalized,

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000
is that Asia, Arabic countries, Latin America,

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:08.000
are much more ahead in being healthy, educated,

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.000
having human resources than they are economically.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000
There's a discrepancy in what's happening today

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000
in the emerging economies.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:19.000
There now, social benefits, social progress,

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.000
are going ahead of economical progress.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:28.000
And 1957 -- the United States had the same economy as Chile has today.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.000
And how long do we have to bring United States

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.000
to get the same health as Chile has today?

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:40.000
I think we have to go, there -- we have 2001, or 2002 --

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000
the United States has the same health as Chile.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:43.000
Chile's catching up!

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000
Within some years Chile may have better child survival

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.000
than the United States.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.000
This is really a change, that you have this lag

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:56.000
of more or less 30, 40 years' difference on the health.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000
And behind the health is the educational level.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000
And there's a lot of infrastructure things,

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000
and general human resources are there.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.000
Now we can take away this --

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:10.000
and I would like to show you the rate of speed,

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.000
the rate of change, how fast they have gone.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:20.000
And we go back to 1920, and I want to look at Japan.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.000
And I want to look at Sweden and the United States.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000
And I'm going to stage a race here

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.000
between this sort of yellowish Ford here

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000
and the red Toyota down there,

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.000
and the brownish Volvo.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.000
(Laughter)

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.000
And here we go. Here we go.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:40.000
The Toyota has a very bad start down here, you can see,

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:43.000
and the United States Ford is going off-road there.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:44.000
And the Volvo is doing quite fine.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.000
This is the war. The Toyota got off track, and now

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:49.000
the Toyota is coming on the healthier side of Sweden --

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:50.000
can you see that?

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:51.000
And they are taking over Sweden,

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000
and they are now healthier than Sweden.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000
That's the part where I sold the Volvo and bought the Toyota.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.000
(Laughter)

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:02.000
And now we can see that the rate of change was enormous in Japan.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000
They really caught up.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.000
And this changes gradually.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.000
We have to look over generations to understand it.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:14.000
And let me show you my own sort of family history --

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.000
we made these graphs here.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:20.000
And this is the same thing, money down there, and health, you know?

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.000
And this is my family.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:27.000
This is Sweden, 1830, when my great-great-grandma was born.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000
Sweden was like Sierra Leone today.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:34.000
And this is when great-grandma was born, 1863.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.000
And Sweden was like Mozambique.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.000
And this is when my grandma was born, 1891.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.000
She took care of me as a child,

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.000
so I'm not talking about statistic now --

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.000
now it's oral history in my family.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:47.000
That's when I believe statistics,

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:50.000
when it's grandma-verified statistics.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:53.000
(Laughter)

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:56.000
I think it's the best way of verifying historical statistics.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:57.000
Sweden was like Ghana.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:00.000
It's interesting to see the enormous diversity

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000
within sub-Saharan Africa.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.000
I told you last year, I'll tell you again,

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:08.000
my mother was born in Egypt, and I -- who am I?

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:09.000
I'm the Mexican in the family.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000
And my daughter, she was born in Chile,

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.000
and the grand-daughter was born in Singapore,

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.000
now the healthiest country on this Earth.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.000
It bypassed Sweden about two to three years ago,

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.000
with better child survival.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:21.000
But they're very small, you know?

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.000
They're so close to the hospital we can never

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:24.000
beat them out in these forests.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.000
(Laughter)

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:28.000
But homage to Singapore.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.000
Singapore is the best one.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:34.000
Now this looks also like a very good story.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:38.000
But it's not really that easy, that it's all a good story.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:41.000
Because I have to show you one of the other facilities.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:46.000
We can also make the color here represent the variable --

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:47.000
and what am I choosing here?

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:51.000
Carbon-dioxide emission, metric ton per capita.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:57.000
This is 1962, and United States was emitting 16 tons per person.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.000
And China was emitting 0.6,

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:03.000
and India was emitting 0.32 tons per capita.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:06.000
And what happens when we moved on?

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.000
Well, you see the nice story of getting richer

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:09.000
and getting healthier --

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:14.000
everyone did it at the cost of emission of carbon dioxide.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:17.000
There is no one who has done it so far.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:20.000
And we don't have all the updated data

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:23.000
any longer, because this is really hot data today.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.000
And there we are, 2001.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:30.000
And in the discussion I attended with global leaders, you know,

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:34.000
many say now the problem is that the emerging economies,

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:37.000
they are getting out too much carbon dioxide.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.000
The Minister of the Environment of India said,

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:42.000
"Well, you were the one who caused the problem."

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.000
The OECD countries -- the high-income countries --

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.000
they were the ones who caused the climate change.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.000
"But we forgive you, because you didn't know it.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:53.000
But from now on, we count per capita.

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.000
From now on we count per capita.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:58.000
And everyone is responsible for the per capita emission."

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:01.000
This really shows you, we have not seen good economic

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.000
and health progress anywhere in the world

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:07.000
without destroying the climate.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.000
And this is really what has to be changed.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:14.000
I've been criticized for showing you a too positive image of the world,

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.000
but I don't think it's like this.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.000
The world is quite a messy place.

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.000
This we can call Dollar Street.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.000
Everyone lives on this street here.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:25.000
What they earn here -- what number they live on --

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:26.000
is how much they earn per day.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:29.000
This family earns about one dollar per day.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:31.000
We drive up the street here,

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:35.000
we find a family here which earns about two to three dollars a day.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:38.000
And we drive away here -- we find the first garden in the street,

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.000
and they earn 10 to 50 dollars a day.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.000
And how do they live?

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:45.000
If we look at the bed here, we can see

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:48.000
that they sleep on a rug on the floor.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.000
This is what poverty line is --

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:53.000
80 percent of the family income is just to cover the energy needs,

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.000
the food for the day.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:58.000
This is two to five dollars. You have a bed.

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.000
And here it's a much nicer bedroom, you can see.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:03.000
I lectured on this for Ikea, and they wanted to see

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:05.000
the sofa immediately here.

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:07.000
(Laughter)

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:11.000
And this is the sofa, how it will emerge from there.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:14.000
And the interesting thing, when you go around here in the photo panorama,

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.000
you see the family still sitting on the floor there.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.000
Although there is a sofa,

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.000
if you watch in the kitchen, you can see that

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:25.000
the great difference for women does not come between one to 10 dollars.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.000
It comes beyond here, when you really can get

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:30.000
good working conditions in the family.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.000
And if you really want to see the difference,

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.000
you look at the toilet over here.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.000
This can change. This can change.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:39.000
These are all pictures and images from Africa,

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.000
and it can become much better.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:44.000
We can get out of poverty.

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:47.000
My own research has not been in IT or anything like this.

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:50.000
I spent 20 years in interviews with African farmers

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:53.000
who were on the verge of famine.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.000
And this is the result of the farmers-needs research.

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:57.000
The nice thing here is that you can't see

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.000
who are the researchers in this picture.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:02.000
That's when research functions in poor societies --

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.000
you must really live with the people.

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:10.000
When you're in poverty, everything is about survival.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.000
It's about having food.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.000
And these two young farmers, they are girls now --

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:18.000
because the parents are dead from HIV and AIDS --

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.000
they discuss with a trained agronomist.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:24.000
This is one of the best agronomists in Malawi, Junatambe Kumbira,

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:26.000
and he's discussing what sort of cassava they will plant --

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:30.000
the best converter of sunshine to food that man has found.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:33.000
And they are very, very eagerly interested to get advice,

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:36.000
and that's to survive in poverty.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:37.000
That's one context.

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.000
Getting out of poverty.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:42.000
The women told us one thing. "Get us technology.

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:45.000
We hate this mortar, to stand hours and hours.

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:48.000
Get us a mill so that we can mill our flour,

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:51.000
then we will be able to pay for the rest ourselves."

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:54.000
Technology will bring you out of poverty,

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:58.000
but there's a need for a market to get away from poverty.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:01.000
And this woman is very happy now, bringing her products to the market.

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:03.000
But she's very thankful for the public investment in schooling

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:06.000
so she can count, and won't be cheated when she reaches the market.

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:09.000
She wants her kid to be healthy, so she can go to the market

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:11.000
and doesn't have to stay home.

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:14.000
And she wants the infrastructure -- it is nice with a paved road.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.000
It's also good with credit.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:19.000
Micro-credits gave her the bicycle, you know.

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:22.000
And information will tell her when to go to market with which product.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.000
You can do this.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:27.000
I find my experience from 20 years of Africa is that

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:30.000
the seemingly impossible is possible.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.000
Africa has not done bad.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:35.000
In 50 years they've gone from a pre-Medieval situation

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:38.000
to a very decent 100-year-ago Europe,

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:41.000
with a functioning nation and state.

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:44.000
I would say that sub-Saharan Africa has done best in the world

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:45.000
during the last 50 years.

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.000
Because we don't consider where they came from.

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:50.000
It's this stupid concept of developing countries

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:53.000
that puts us, Argentina and Mozambique together 50 years ago,

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.000
and says that Mozambique did worse.

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:58.000
We have to know a little more about the world.

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:01.000
I have a neighbor who knows 200 types of wine.

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:02.000
He knows everything.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.000
He knows the name of the grape, the temperature and everything.

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:07.000
I only know two types of wine -- red and white.

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:09.000
(Laughter)

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:11.000
But my neighbor only knows two types of countries --

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:13.000
industrialized and developing.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:16.000
And I know 200, I know about the small data.

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:17.000
But you can do that.

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:22.000
(Applause)

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:24.000
But I have to get serious. And how do you get serious?

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.000
You make a PowerPoint, you know?

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:31.000
(Laughter)

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:33.000
Homage to the Office package, no?

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:37.000
What is this, what is this, what am I telling?

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:40.000
I'm telling you that there are many dimensions of development.

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.000
Everyone wants your pet thing.

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:45.000
If you are in the corporate sector, you love micro-credit.

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:47.000
If you are fighting in a non-governmental organization,

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:50.000
you love equity between gender.

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:52.000
Or if you are a teacher, you'll love UNESCO, and so on.

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:54.000
On the global level, we have to have more than our own thing.

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:56.000
We need everything.

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:58.000
All these things are important for development,

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:00.000
especially when you just get out of poverty

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:03.000
and you should go towards welfare.

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:05.000
Now, what we need to think about

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:08.000
is, what is a goal for development,

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:09.000
and what are the means for development?

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:12.000
Let me first grade what are the most important means.

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:15.000
Economic growth to me, as a public-health professor,

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:19.000
is the most important thing for development

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:21.000
because it explains 80 percent of survival.

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:25.000
Governance. To have a government which functions --

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:29.000
that's what brought California out of the misery of 1850.

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:32.000
It was the government that made law function finally.

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:35.000
Education, human resources are important.

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:39.000
Health is also important, but not that much as a mean.

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:41.000
Environment is important.

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:43.000
Human rights is also important, but it just gets one cross.

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:46.000
Now what about goals? Where are we going toward?

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:48.000
We are not interested in money.

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:49.000
Money is not a goal.

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:52.000
It's the best mean, but I give it zero as a goal.

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:56.000
Governance, well it's fun to vote in a little thing,

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:58.000
but it's not a goal.

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:02.000
And going to school, that's not a goal, it's a mean.

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:04.000
Health I give two points. I mean it's nice to be healthy

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:06.000
-- at my age especially -- you can stand here, you're healthy.

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:08.000
And that's good, it gets two plusses.

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:10.000
Environment is very, very crucial.

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:12.000
There's nothing for the grandkid if you don't save up.

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:14.000
But where are the important goals?

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:16.000
Of course, it's human rights.

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:18.000
Human rights is the goal,

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:21.000
but it's not that strong of a mean for achieving development.

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:26.000
And culture. Culture is the most important thing, I would say,

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:28.000
because that's what brings joy to life.

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:30.000
That's the value of living.

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:33.000
So the seemingly impossible is possible.

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:35.000
Even African countries can achieve this.

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:42.000
And I've shown you the shot where the seemingly impossible is possible.

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:46.000
And remember, please remember my main message,

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:49.000
which is this: the seemingly impossible is possible.

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:51.000
We can have a good world.

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:54.000
I showed you the shots, I proved it in the PowerPoint,

00:16:54.000 --> 00:17:00.000
and I think I will convince you also by culture.

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:04.000
(Laughter)

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:05.000
(Applause)

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:07.000
Bring me my sword!

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:16.000
Sword swallowing is from ancient India.

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:21.000
It's a cultural expression that for thousands of years

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:27.000
has inspired human beings to think beyond the obvious.

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:29.000
(Laughter)

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:34.000
And I will now prove to you that the seemingly impossible is possible

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:37.000
by taking this piece of steel -- solid steel --

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:41.000
this is the army bayonet from the Swedish Army, 1850,

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:43.000
in the last year we had war.

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:47.000
And it's all solid steel -- you can hear here.

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:53.000
And I'm going to take this blade of steel,

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:58.000
and push it down through my body of blood and flesh,

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:02.000
and prove to you that the seemingly impossible is possible.

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:07.000
Can I request a moment of absolute silence?

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:40.000
(Applause)
