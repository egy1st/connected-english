00:00:01.674 --> 00:00:07.924
I want to talk to you about two
of the most exciting possible things.

00:00:07.948 --> 00:00:09.897
You've probably guessed what they are --

00:00:09.921 --> 00:00:12.240
data and history.

00:00:13.211 --> 00:00:14.382
Right?

00:00:15.871 --> 00:00:17.853
So, I'm not a historian.

00:00:17.877 --> 00:00:20.605
I'm not going to give you
a definition of history.

00:00:20.629 --> 00:00:23.742
But let's think instead
of history within a framework.

00:00:23.766 --> 00:00:25.377
So, when we're making history,

00:00:25.401 --> 00:00:28.293
or when we're creating
historical documents,

00:00:28.317 --> 00:00:30.745
we're taking things
that have happened in the past,

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:33.321
and we're stitching them
together into a story.

00:00:33.345 --> 00:00:35.875
So let me start with a little bit
of my own story.

00:00:35.899 --> 00:00:39.577
Like anybody my age
who works creatively with computers,

00:00:39.601 --> 00:00:44.057
I was a popular, socially
well-adjusted young man --

00:00:44.081 --> 00:00:45.203
(Laughter)

00:00:45.227 --> 00:00:47.768
And sporty!

00:00:47.792 --> 00:00:49.525
Sporty young man.

00:00:50.075 --> 00:00:55.428
And like a lot of people my age
in the type of business that I'm in,

00:00:55.452 --> 00:00:58.097
I was influenced tremendously by Apple.

00:00:58.635 --> 00:01:02.357
But notice my choice of logo here, right?

00:01:02.381 --> 00:01:05.966
The Apple on the left,
not the Apple on the right.

00:01:06.621 --> 00:01:08.914
I'm influenced as much
by the Apple on the right

00:01:08.938 --> 00:01:11.021
as the next person,

00:01:11.045 --> 00:01:13.678
but the Apple on the left --
I mean, look at that logo!

00:01:13.702 --> 00:01:16.099
It's a rainbow.
It's not even in the right order!

00:01:16.123 --> 00:01:17.257
(Laughter)

00:01:17.281 --> 00:01:19.554
That's how crazy Apple was.

00:01:19.578 --> 00:01:20.615
(Laughter)

00:01:20.639 --> 00:01:23.584
But I don't want to talk too much
about the company.

00:01:23.608 --> 00:01:25.785
I'll start talking about
a machine, though.

00:01:25.809 --> 00:01:29.936
How amazing it is to think about this.
I go back and I think about this.

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:33.274
Wednesday -- one Wednesday,
when I was about 12 years old,

00:01:33.298 --> 00:01:35.409
I didn't have a computer.

00:01:36.034 --> 00:01:38.813
On Thursday, I had a computer.

00:01:39.965 --> 00:01:41.964
Can you imagine that change?

00:01:42.417 --> 00:01:44.098
It's so drastic.

00:01:44.122 --> 00:01:47.573
I can't even think about anything
that could change our lives that way.

00:01:47.597 --> 00:01:50.364
But I'm actually not even going
to talk about the computer.

00:01:50.388 --> 00:01:53.618
I'm going to talk about a program
that came loaded on that computer.

00:01:53.642 --> 00:01:55.914
And it was build by,
not the guy on the left,

00:01:55.938 --> 00:01:57.373
but the guy on the right.

00:01:57.397 --> 00:01:59.541
Does anybody know
who the guy on the right is?

00:02:01.161 --> 00:02:03.571
Nobody ever knows the answer
to this question.

00:02:03.595 --> 00:02:05.281
This is Bill Atkinson.

00:02:05.305 --> 00:02:08.412
And Bill Atkinson was responsible
for tons of things

00:02:08.436 --> 00:02:10.918
that you see on your computer every day.

00:02:10.942 --> 00:02:14.049
But I want to talk about one program
that Bill Atkinson wrote,

00:02:14.073 --> 00:02:15.573
called HyperCard.

00:02:17.025 --> 00:02:19.185
Someone's cheering over there.

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:20.414
(Laughter)

00:02:20.438 --> 00:02:23.040
HyperCard was a program
that shipped with the Mac,

00:02:23.064 --> 00:02:25.633
and it was designed
for users of the computer

00:02:25.657 --> 00:02:28.854
to make programs on their computers.

00:02:29.505 --> 00:02:31.102
Crazy idea today.

00:02:31.126 --> 00:02:34.099
And these programs were not the apps
that we think about today,

00:02:34.123 --> 00:02:36.572
with their large budgets
and their big distribution.

00:02:36.596 --> 00:02:37.785
These were small things,

00:02:37.809 --> 00:02:41.691
people making applications to keep track
of their local basketball team scores

00:02:41.715 --> 00:02:44.540
or to organize their research

00:02:44.564 --> 00:02:47.580
or to teach people about classical music

00:02:47.604 --> 00:02:51.699
or to calculate weird astronomical dates.

00:02:51.723 --> 00:02:54.104
And then, of course,
there were some art projects.

00:02:54.128 --> 00:02:55.348
This is my favorite one.

00:02:55.372 --> 00:02:57.461
It's called "If Monks Had Macs,"

00:02:57.485 --> 00:03:02.019
and it's a nonlinear
kind of exploratory environment.

00:03:02.043 --> 00:03:07.616
I thank the stars for HyperCard
all of the time.

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:10.087
And I thank the stars
for putting me in this era

00:03:10.111 --> 00:03:12.411
where I got to use HyperCard.

00:03:12.435 --> 00:03:17.075
HyperCard was the last program to ship
on a public computer

00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:22.228
that was designed for the users
of the computer to make programs with it.

00:03:22.252 --> 00:03:24.957
If you talked to the people
who invented the computer

00:03:24.981 --> 00:03:27.730
and you told them there would be
a day, a magical day,

00:03:27.754 --> 00:03:32.816
when everybody had a computer
but none of them knew how to program,

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:34.651
they would think you were crazy.

00:03:35.486 --> 00:03:37.150
So let's skip forward a few years.

00:03:37.174 --> 00:03:39.762
I'm starting my career as an artist,

00:03:39.786 --> 00:03:43.748
and I'm building things
with my computer, small-scale things,

00:03:43.772 --> 00:03:47.375
investigating things like
the growth systems of plants.

00:03:47.399 --> 00:03:50.398
Or, in this example, I'm building
a simulated economy

00:03:50.422 --> 00:03:54.383
in which pixels are trading color
with one another,

00:03:54.407 --> 00:03:56.982
trying to investigate how
these types of systems work,

00:03:57.006 --> 00:03:58.408
and just kind of having fun.

00:03:58.432 --> 00:04:01.060
And then this project led me
to start working with data.

00:04:01.084 --> 00:04:04.073
So I'm building graphics like this,

00:04:04.097 --> 00:04:06.691
which compare "communism" --

00:04:06.715 --> 00:04:10.110
the frequency of usage of the word
"communism" in the New York Times --

00:04:10.134 --> 00:04:12.071
to "terrorism," at the top.

00:04:12.095 --> 00:04:16.720
You see "terrorism" kind of appears
as "communism" is going away.

00:04:16.744 --> 00:04:20.560
And with these graphics, I was really
interested in the aesthetic of the graphs.

00:04:20.584 --> 00:04:21.734
This is Iran and Iraq.

00:04:21.758 --> 00:04:25.668
It reads like a clock. It's called
a "timepiece graph."

00:04:25.692 --> 00:04:31.403
This is another timepiece graph,
overlaying "despair" over "hope."

00:04:31.427 --> 00:04:34.737
And there's only three times -- actually,
it's "crisis" over "hope" --

00:04:34.761 --> 00:04:37.370
there's only three times
when "crisis" eclipses "hope."

00:04:37.394 --> 00:04:39.549
We're in the middle
of one of them right now.

00:04:39.573 --> 00:04:41.345
But don't think about that too much.

00:04:41.369 --> 00:04:43.257
(Laughter)

00:04:43.281 --> 00:04:47.061
And finally, the culmination of this work
with the New York Times data

00:04:47.085 --> 00:04:48.287
a few years ago

00:04:48.311 --> 00:04:51.487
was the attempt to combine
an entire year's news cycle

00:04:51.511 --> 00:04:52.824
into a single graphic.

00:04:52.848 --> 00:04:57.075
So these graphics actually show us
a full year of news, all the people,

00:04:57.099 --> 00:04:59.729
and how they're connected
into a single graphic.

00:04:59.753 --> 00:05:03.691
And from there, I started to be
interested again in more active systems.

00:05:03.715 --> 00:05:05.979
Here's a project called "Just Landed,"

00:05:06.003 --> 00:05:09.154
where I'm looking at people
tweeting on Twitter.

00:05:09.178 --> 00:05:11.238
"Hey! I just landed
in Hawaii!" -- you know,

00:05:11.262 --> 00:05:14.964
how people just casually try to sneak
that into their Twitter conversation.

00:05:14.988 --> 00:05:18.105
"I'm not showing off. Really.
But I did just land in Hawaii."

00:05:18.129 --> 00:05:20.872
And then I'm plotting
those people's trips,

00:05:20.896 --> 00:05:24.108
in the hopes that maybe
we can use social network

00:05:24.132 --> 00:05:25.813
and the data that it leaves behind

00:05:25.837 --> 00:05:28.036
to provide a model of how people move,

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:31.035
which would be valuable
to epidemiologists, among other people.

00:05:31.059 --> 00:05:33.638
And, more fun -- this
is a similar project,

00:05:33.662 --> 00:05:36.153
looking at people
saying "Good morning" to each other

00:05:36.177 --> 00:05:37.360
all around the world.

00:05:37.384 --> 00:05:38.818
Which taught me, by the way,

00:05:38.842 --> 00:05:43.192
that it is true that people in Vancouver
on the West Coast wake up much later

00:05:43.216 --> 00:05:44.799
and say "Good morning" much later

00:05:44.823 --> 00:05:46.684
than the people on the East Coast,

00:05:46.708 --> 00:05:48.507
who are more adventurous.

00:05:48.531 --> 00:05:50.505
Here's a more useful -- maybe -- project,

00:05:50.529 --> 00:05:53.880
where I took all the information
from the Kepler Project

00:05:53.904 --> 00:05:56.947
and tried to put it into some visual form
that made sense to me.

00:05:56.971 --> 00:05:59.855
And I should say that everything
I've shown you up to now --

00:05:59.879 --> 00:06:02.031
these are all things
that I just did for fun.

00:06:02.055 --> 00:06:04.790
It may seem weird,
but this comes back from HyperCard.

00:06:04.814 --> 00:06:06.644
I'm building tools for myself.

00:06:06.668 --> 00:06:08.651
I may share them with a few other people,

00:06:08.675 --> 00:06:10.782
but they're for fun, they're for me.

00:06:13.341 --> 00:06:17.311
So, all these tools I show you
kind of occupy this weird space

00:06:17.335 --> 00:06:19.879
somewhere between science, art and design.

00:06:19.903 --> 00:06:21.708
That's where my practice lies.

00:06:21.732 --> 00:06:24.888
And still today,
from my experience with HyperCard,

00:06:24.912 --> 00:06:29.142
what I'm doing is building visual tools
to help me understand systems.

00:06:30.083 --> 00:06:32.304
So today, I work at the New York Times.

00:06:32.328 --> 00:06:35.201
I'm the data artist in residence
at the New York Times.

00:06:35.225 --> 00:06:37.158
And I've had an opportunity at the Times

00:06:37.182 --> 00:06:39.646
to work on a variety
of really interesting projects,

00:06:39.670 --> 00:06:41.892
two of which I'm going
to share with you today.

00:06:41.916 --> 00:06:45.118
The first one, I've been working on
in conjunction with Mark Hansen.

00:06:45.142 --> 00:06:50.284
Mark Hansen is a professor of statistics
at UCLA. He's also a media artist.

00:06:50.308 --> 00:06:53.094
And Mark came to the Times
with a very interesting question

00:06:53.118 --> 00:06:55.778
to what may seem like an obvious problem:

00:06:55.802 --> 00:06:58.953
When people share content on the internet,

00:06:58.977 --> 00:07:02.592
how does that content get
from person A to person B?

00:07:03.358 --> 00:07:08.082
Or maybe, person A to person B
to person C to person D?

00:07:08.106 --> 00:07:10.460
We know that people share content
in the internet,

00:07:10.484 --> 00:07:12.842
but what we don't know
is what happens in that gap

00:07:12.866 --> 00:07:14.657
between one person to the other.

00:07:14.681 --> 00:07:17.037
So we decided to build
the tool to explore that,

00:07:17.061 --> 00:07:18.884
and this tool is called Cascade.

00:07:19.471 --> 00:07:22.066
If we look at these systems

00:07:22.090 --> 00:07:26.520
that start with one event
that leads to other events,

00:07:26.544 --> 00:07:28.782
we call that structure a cascade.

00:07:28.806 --> 00:07:31.215
And these cascades
actually happen over time.

00:07:31.239 --> 00:07:33.259
So we can model these things over time.

00:07:33.283 --> 00:07:37.314
Now, the New York Times has
a lot of people who share our content,

00:07:37.338 --> 00:07:40.829
so the cascades do not look like that one,
they look more like this.

00:07:40.853 --> 00:07:42.393
Here's a typical cascade.

00:07:42.417 --> 00:07:45.131
At the bottom left, the very first event.

00:07:46.237 --> 00:07:50.509
And then as people are sharing
the content from one person to another,

00:07:50.533 --> 00:07:54.327
we go up in the Y axis,
degrees of separation,

00:07:54.351 --> 00:07:57.119
and over on the X axis, for time.

00:07:57.143 --> 00:08:00.644
So we're able to look at that conversation
in a couple of different views:

00:08:00.668 --> 00:08:03.283
this one, which shows us
the threads of conversation,

00:08:03.307 --> 00:08:06.501
and this one, which combines
that stacked view

00:08:06.525 --> 00:08:09.457
with a view that lets us see the threads.

00:08:09.924 --> 00:08:13.269
Now, the Times publishes
about 7,000 pieces of content

00:08:13.293 --> 00:08:14.503
every month.

00:08:14.527 --> 00:08:17.369
So it was important for us,
when we were building this tool,

00:08:17.393 --> 00:08:19.026
to make it an exploratory one,

00:08:19.050 --> 00:08:23.257
so that people could dig through
this vast terrain of data.

00:08:23.281 --> 00:08:25.717
I think of it as a vehicle
that we're giving people

00:08:25.741 --> 00:08:29.214
to traverse this really big
terrain of data.

00:08:29.238 --> 00:08:30.956
So here's what it really looks like,

00:08:30.980 --> 00:08:33.720
and here's the cascade
playing in real time.

00:08:33.744 --> 00:08:35.823
I have to say, this was
a tremendous moment.

00:08:35.847 --> 00:08:39.864
We had been working with canned
data, fake data, for so long,

00:08:39.888 --> 00:08:42.693
that when we saw this
for the first moment,

00:08:42.717 --> 00:08:47.595
it was like an archaeologist who had
just dusted off these dinosaur bones.

00:08:47.619 --> 00:08:51.497
We discovered this thing,
and we were seeing it for the first time,

00:08:51.521 --> 00:08:55.233
these sharing structures
that underlie the internet.

00:08:56.475 --> 00:08:58.580
And maybe the dinosaur
analogy is a good one,

00:08:58.604 --> 00:09:01.651
because we're actually making
some probabilistic guesses

00:09:01.675 --> 00:09:03.034
about how these things link.

00:09:03.058 --> 00:09:05.984
We're looking at some of these
pieces and making some guesses,

00:09:06.008 --> 00:09:09.945
but we try to make sure that those
are as statistically rigorous as possible.

00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:15.382
Now tweets, in this case,
they become parts of stories.

00:09:15.406 --> 00:09:17.331
They become parts of narratives.

00:09:17.355 --> 00:09:19.775
So we are building histories here,

00:09:19.799 --> 00:09:21.974
but they're very short-term histories.

00:09:21.998 --> 00:09:25.836
And sometimes these very large cascades
are the most interesting ones,

00:09:25.860 --> 00:09:28.995
but sometimes the small ones
are also interesting.

00:09:29.019 --> 00:09:32.544
This is one of my favorites.
We call this the "Rabbi Cascade."

00:09:32.568 --> 00:09:37.657
It's a conversation amongst rabbis
about this article in the New York Times,

00:09:37.681 --> 00:09:41.453
about the fact that religious workers
don't get a lot of time off.

00:09:41.477 --> 00:09:45.512
I guess Saturdays and Sundays are bad days
for them to take off.

00:09:45.536 --> 00:09:49.228
So, in this cascade, there's a group
of rabbis having a conversation

00:09:49.252 --> 00:09:50.654
about a New York Times story.

00:09:50.678 --> 00:09:52.802
One of them has the best
Twitter name ever --

00:09:52.826 --> 00:09:54.681
he's called "The Velveteen Rabbi."

00:09:54.705 --> 00:09:57.028
(Laughter)

00:09:57.052 --> 00:10:01.559
But we would have never found this
if it weren't for this exploratory tool.

00:10:01.583 --> 00:10:03.385
This would just be sitting somewhere,

00:10:03.409 --> 00:10:05.595
and we would have never
been able to see that.

00:10:05.619 --> 00:10:09.760
But this exercise of taking
single pieces of information

00:10:09.784 --> 00:10:14.005
and building narrative structures,
building histories out of them,

00:10:14.029 --> 00:10:15.954
I find tremendously interesting.

00:10:16.319 --> 00:10:18.663
You know, I moved to New York
about two years ago.

00:10:18.687 --> 00:10:21.407
And in New York, everybody has a story

00:10:21.431 --> 00:10:24.391
that surrounds this
tremendously impactful event

00:10:24.415 --> 00:10:26.714
that happened on September 11 of 2001.

00:10:27.373 --> 00:10:33.740
And my own story with September 11
has really become a more intricate one,

00:10:33.764 --> 00:10:35.828
because I spent a great deal of time

00:10:35.852 --> 00:10:40.001
working on a piece
of the 9/11 Memorial in Manhattan.

00:10:40.530 --> 00:10:43.094
The central idea about the 9/11 Memorial

00:10:43.118 --> 00:10:47.577
is that the names in the memorial
are not laid out in alphabetical order

00:10:47.601 --> 00:10:49.286
or chronological order,

00:10:49.310 --> 00:10:51.134
but instead, they're laid out in a way

00:10:51.158 --> 00:10:54.582
in which the relationships
between the people who were killed

00:10:54.606 --> 00:10:56.566
are embodied in the memorial.

00:10:57.153 --> 00:10:59.691
Brothers are placed next to brothers,

00:10:59.715 --> 00:11:01.900
coworkers are placed together.

00:11:01.924 --> 00:11:06.589
So this memorial actually considers
all of these myriad connections

00:11:06.613 --> 00:11:09.034
that were part of these people's lives.

00:11:10.310 --> 00:11:13.743
I worked with a company
called Local Projects

00:11:13.767 --> 00:11:16.441
to work on an algorithm
and a software tool

00:11:16.465 --> 00:11:19.469
to help the architects build
the layout for the memorial:

00:11:20.331 --> 00:11:22.053
almost 3,000 names

00:11:22.077 --> 00:11:25.704
and almost 1,500 of these
adjacency requests,

00:11:25.728 --> 00:11:27.338
these requests for connection --

00:11:27.362 --> 00:11:30.748
so a very dense story,
a very dense narrative,

00:11:30.772 --> 00:11:33.588
that becomes an embodied part
of this memorial.

00:11:34.195 --> 00:11:37.526
Working with Jake Barton,
we produce the software tool,

00:11:37.550 --> 00:11:41.669
which allows the architects to,
first of all, generate a layout

00:11:41.693 --> 00:11:44.822
that satisfied all of those
adjacency requests,

00:11:44.846 --> 00:11:47.879
but then second, make little adjustments
where they needed to

00:11:47.903 --> 00:11:50.251
to tell the stories
that they wanted to tell.

00:11:51.219 --> 00:11:55.354
So this memorial, I think,
has an incredibly timely concept

00:11:55.378 --> 00:11:58.368
in our era of social networks,

00:11:58.392 --> 00:12:02.367
because these networks -- these real-life
networks that make up people's lives --

00:12:02.391 --> 00:12:04.823
are actually embodied
inside of the memorial.

00:12:05.286 --> 00:12:08.757
And one of the most tremendously
moving experiences

00:12:08.781 --> 00:12:10.442
is to go to the memorial

00:12:10.466 --> 00:12:14.666
and see how these people
are placed next to each other,

00:12:14.690 --> 00:12:17.552
so that this memorial
is representing their own lives.

00:12:18.859 --> 00:12:20.546
How does this affect our lives?

00:12:21.133 --> 00:12:22.809
Well, I don't know if you remember,

00:12:22.833 --> 00:12:25.546
but in the spring,
there was a controversy,

00:12:25.570 --> 00:12:27.768
because it was discovered
that on the iPhone

00:12:27.792 --> 00:12:29.398
and, actually, on your computer,

00:12:29.422 --> 00:12:32.737
we were storing a tremendous amount
of the location data.

00:12:33.173 --> 00:12:37.034
So Apple responded, saying,
this was not location data about you,

00:12:37.058 --> 00:12:39.863
it was location data
about wireless networks

00:12:39.887 --> 00:12:42.174
that were in the area where you are.

00:12:42.198 --> 00:12:43.626
So it's not about you,

00:12:43.650 --> 00:12:45.234
but it's about where you are.

00:12:45.258 --> 00:12:46.906
(Laughter)

00:12:46.930 --> 00:12:49.738
This is very valuable data.

00:12:49.762 --> 00:12:54.387
It's like gold to researchers,
this human-mobility data.

00:12:54.411 --> 00:12:58.075
So we thought, "Man!
How many people have iPhones?"

00:12:58.099 --> 00:12:59.547
How many of you have iPhones?

00:13:00.608 --> 00:13:06.086
So in this room, we have this tremendous
database of location data

00:13:06.110 --> 00:13:09.885
that researchers
would really, really like.

00:13:09.909 --> 00:13:11.940
So we built this system called Open Paths,

00:13:11.964 --> 00:13:14.620
which lets people upload their iPhone data

00:13:14.644 --> 00:13:18.440
and broker relationships
with researchers to share that data,

00:13:18.464 --> 00:13:21.851
to donate that data to people
that can actually put it to use.

00:13:22.256 --> 00:13:24.606
Open Paths was a great
success as a prototype.

00:13:24.630 --> 00:13:28.063
We received thousands of data sets,

00:13:28.087 --> 00:13:29.436
and we built this interface

00:13:29.460 --> 00:13:32.778
which allows people to actually
see their lives unfolding

00:13:32.802 --> 00:13:35.958
from these traces
that are left behind on your devices.

00:13:36.593 --> 00:13:41.860
Now, what we didn't expect
was how moving this experience would be.

00:13:41.884 --> 00:13:44.111
When I uploaded my data,
I thought, "Big deal.

00:13:44.135 --> 00:13:47.551
I know where I live. I know where I work.
What am I going to see here?"

00:13:47.575 --> 00:13:51.076
Well, it turns out, what I saw
was that moment I got off the plane

00:13:51.100 --> 00:13:52.723
to start my new life in New York;

00:13:53.588 --> 00:13:56.194
the restaurant where I had Thai food
that first night,

00:13:56.218 --> 00:13:59.171
thinking about this new experience
of being in New York;

00:13:59.195 --> 00:14:00.818
the day that I met my girlfriend.

00:14:02.587 --> 00:14:04.862
This is LaGuardia airport.

00:14:04.886 --> 00:14:06.373
(Laughter)

00:14:06.397 --> 00:14:10.038
This is this Thai restaurant
on Amsterdam Avenue.

00:14:10.559 --> 00:14:12.609
This is the moment I met my girlfriend.

00:14:14.146 --> 00:14:17.597
See how that changes the first time
I told you about those stories

00:14:17.621 --> 00:14:20.089
and the second time I told
you about those stories?

00:14:20.113 --> 00:14:23.320
Because what we do
in the tool, inadvertently,

00:14:23.344 --> 00:14:26.459
is we put these pieces of data
into a human context.

00:14:26.935 --> 00:14:29.433
And by placing data into a human context,

00:14:29.457 --> 00:14:30.931
it gains meaning.

00:14:30.955 --> 00:14:34.283
And I think this is tremendously,
tremendously important,

00:14:34.307 --> 00:14:39.225
because these are our histories
that are being stored on these devices.

00:14:40.809 --> 00:14:42.803
And by thinking about them that way,

00:14:43.543 --> 00:14:45.445
putting them in a human context --

00:14:45.469 --> 00:14:49.131
first of all, what we do with our own data
is get a better understanding

00:14:49.155 --> 00:14:51.634
of the type of information
that we're sharing.

00:14:51.658 --> 00:14:55.711
But if we can do this with other data,
if we can put data into a human context,

00:14:55.735 --> 00:14:58.653
I think we can change a lot of things,

00:14:58.677 --> 00:15:05.062
because it builds, automatically, empathy
for the people involved in these systems.

00:15:05.602 --> 00:15:08.555
And that, in turn, results
in a fundamental respect,

00:15:08.579 --> 00:15:11.742
which, I believe, is missing
in a large part of technology,

00:15:12.329 --> 00:15:15.267
when we start to deal
with issues like privacy,

00:15:16.765 --> 00:15:19.482
by understanding that these numbers
are not just numbers,

00:15:19.506 --> 00:15:23.125
but instead they're attached, tethered to,
pieces of the real world.

00:15:23.149 --> 00:15:24.655
They carry weight.

00:15:24.679 --> 00:15:28.011
By understanding that,
the dialog becomes a lot different.

00:15:29.595 --> 00:15:31.926
How many of you have ever clicked a button

00:15:31.950 --> 00:15:36.937
that enables a third party to access
your location data on your phone?

00:15:37.595 --> 00:15:39.150
Lots of you.

00:15:39.174 --> 00:15:41.419
So the third party is the developer,

00:15:41.443 --> 00:15:43.244
the second party is Apple.

00:15:43.954 --> 00:15:48.777
The only party that never gets access
to this information is the first party!

00:15:50.198 --> 00:15:53.333
And I think that's because we think
about these pieces of data

00:15:53.357 --> 00:15:55.412
in this stranded, abstract way.

00:15:55.436 --> 00:15:57.333
We don't put them into a context

00:15:57.357 --> 00:15:59.666
which, I think, makes them
a lot more important.

00:15:59.690 --> 00:16:01.856
So what I'm asking you
to do is really simple:

00:16:01.880 --> 00:16:04.203
start to think about data
in a human context.

00:16:04.918 --> 00:16:06.575
It doesn't really take anything.

00:16:06.599 --> 00:16:09.958
When you read stock prices,
think about them in a human context.

00:16:09.982 --> 00:16:13.524
When you think about mortgage reports,
think about them in a human context.

00:16:13.548 --> 00:16:17.478
There's no doubt that big data
is big business.

00:16:17.502 --> 00:16:20.520
There's an industry being developed here.

00:16:21.520 --> 00:16:23.021
Think about how well we've done

00:16:23.045 --> 00:16:26.414
in previous industries
that we've developed involving resources.

00:16:26.438 --> 00:16:27.738
Not very well at all.

00:16:27.762 --> 00:16:32.284
I think part of that problem is, we've had
a lack of participation in these dialogues

00:16:32.308 --> 00:16:36.736
from multiple pieces of human society.

00:16:36.760 --> 00:16:38.752
So the other thing that I'm asking for

00:16:39.669 --> 00:16:44.047
is an inclusion in this dialogue
from artists, from poets, from writers --

00:16:44.071 --> 00:16:48.084
from people who can bring a human element
into this discussion.

00:16:48.725 --> 00:16:51.081
Because I believe that this world of data

00:16:51.105 --> 00:16:54.130
is going to be transformative for us.

00:16:54.687 --> 00:16:57.856
And unlike our attempts
with the resource industry

00:16:57.880 --> 00:17:00.033
and our attempts
with the financial industry,

00:17:00.057 --> 00:17:02.988
by bringing the human
element into this story,

00:17:03.012 --> 00:17:05.190
I think we can take it
to tremendous places.

00:17:06.203 --> 00:17:07.358
Thank you.

00:17:07.382 --> 00:17:11.434
(Applause)
