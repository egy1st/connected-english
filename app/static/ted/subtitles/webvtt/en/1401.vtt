00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
The electricity powering the lights in this theater

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
was generated just moments ago.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Because the way things stand today,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
electricity demand must be in constant balance

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
with electricity supply.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
If in the time that it took me to walk out here on this stage,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
some tens of megawatts of wind power

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
stopped pouring into the grid,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
the difference would have to be made up

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
from other generators immediately.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
But coal plants, nuclear plants

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
can't respond fast enough.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
A giant battery could.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
With a giant battery,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
we'd be able to address the problem of intermittency

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
that prevents wind and solar

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
from contributing to the grid

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
in the same way that coal, gas and nuclear do today.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
You see, the battery

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
is the key enabling device here.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
With it, we could draw electricity from the sun

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
even when the sun doesn't shine.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
And that changes everything.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
Because then renewables

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
such as wind and solar

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
come out from the wings,

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
here to center stage.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
Today I want to tell you about such a device.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
It's called the liquid metal battery.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
It's a new form of energy storage

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
that I invented at MIT

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
along with a team of my students

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
and post-docs.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
Now the theme of this year's TED Conference is Full Spectrum.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
The OED defines spectrum

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
as "The entire range of wavelengths

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
of electromagnetic radiation,

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
from the longest radio waves to the shortest gamma rays

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
of which the range of visible light

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
is only a small part."

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
So I'm not here today only to tell you

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
how my team at MIT has drawn out of nature

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000
a solution to one of the world's great problems.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
I want to go full spectrum and tell you how,

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
in the process of developing

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
this new technology,

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
we've uncovered some surprising heterodoxies

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
that can serve as lessons for innovation,

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000
ideas worth spreading.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
And you know,

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.000
if we're going to get this country out of its current energy situation,

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000
we can't just conserve our way out;

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000
we can't just drill our way out;

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
we can't bomb our way out.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
We're going to do it the old-fashioned American way,

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
we're going to invent our way out,

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
working together.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000
(Applause)

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
Now let's get started.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
The battery was invented about 200 years ago

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
by a professor, Alessandro Volta,

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000
at the University of Padua in Italy.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
His invention gave birth to a new field of science,

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
electrochemistry,

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
and new technologies

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
such as electroplating.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
Perhaps overlooked,

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
Volta's invention of the battery

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
for the first time also

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
demonstrated the utility of a professor.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
(Laughter)

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
Until Volta, nobody could imagine

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000
a professor could be of any use.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000
Here's the first battery --

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000
a stack of coins, zinc and silver,

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000
separated by cardboard soaked in brine.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
This is the starting point

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
for designing a battery --

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000
two electrodes,

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000
in this case metals of different composition,

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000
and an electrolyte,

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
in this case salt dissolved in water.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
The science is that simple.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.000
Admittedly, I've left out a few details.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
Now I've taught you

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000
that battery science is straightforward

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000
and the need for grid-level storage

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000
is compelling,

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000
but the fact is

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.000
that today there is simply no battery technology

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000
capable of meeting

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:49.000
the demanding performance requirements of the grid --

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000
namely uncommonly high power,

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000
long service lifetime

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000
and super-low cost.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.000
We need to think about the problem differently.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000
We need to think big,

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
we need to think cheap.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000
So let's abandon the paradigm

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.000
of let's search for the coolest chemistry

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000
and then hopefully we'll chase down the cost curve

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000
by just making lots and lots of product.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000
Instead, let's invent

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.000
to the price point of the electricity market.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000
So that means

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000
that certain parts of the periodic table

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000
are axiomatically off-limits.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.000
This battery needs to be made

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000
out of earth-abundant elements.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000
I say, if you want to make something dirt cheap,

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
make it out of dirt --

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000
(Laughter)

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000
preferably dirt

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.000
that's locally sourced.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.000
And we need to be able to build this thing

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.000
using simple manufacturing techniques and factories

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000
that don't cost us a fortune.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000
So about six years ago,

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000
I started thinking about this problem.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.000
And in order to adopt a fresh perspective,

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.000
I sought inspiration from beyond the field of electricity storage.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000
In fact, I looked to a technology

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000
that neither stores nor generates electricity,

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000
but instead consumes electricity,

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000
huge amounts of it.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:14.000
I'm talking about the production of aluminum.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000
The process was invented in 1886

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000
by a couple of 22-year-olds --

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.000
Hall in the United States and Heroult in France.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.000
And just a few short years following their discovery,

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000
aluminum changed

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.000
from a precious metal costing as much as silver

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.000
to a common structural material.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.000
You're looking at the cell house of a modern aluminum smelter.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000
It's about 50 feet wide

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000
and recedes about half a mile --

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.000
row after row of cells

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.000
that, inside, resemble Volta's battery,

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000
with three important differences.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.000
Volta's battery works at room temperature.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.000
It's fitted with solid electrodes

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.000
and an electrolyte that's a solution of salt and water.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000
The Hall-Heroult cell

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000
operates at high temperature,

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000
a temperature high enough

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.000
that the aluminum metal product is liquid.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.000
The electrolyte

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000
is not a solution of salt and water,

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000
but rather salt that's melted.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000
It's this combination of liquid metal,

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.000
molten salt and high temperature

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:19.000
that allows us to send high current through this thing.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.000
Today, we can produce virgin metal from ore

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.000
at a cost of less than 50 cents a pound.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000
That's the economic miracle

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000
of modern electrometallurgy.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.000
It is this that caught and held my attention

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:36.000
to the point that I became obsessed with inventing a battery

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:40.000
that could capture this gigantic economy of scale.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000
And I did.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.000
I made the battery all liquid --

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000
liquid metals for both electrodes

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000
and a molten salt for the electrolyte.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:52.000
I'll show you how.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.000
So I put low-density

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:16.000
liquid metal at the top,

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:22.000
put a high-density liquid metal at the bottom,

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:25.000
and molten salt in between.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000
So now,

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.000
how to choose the metals?

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.000
For me, the design exercise

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.000
always begins here

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.000
with the periodic table,

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.000
enunciated by another professor,

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.000
Dimitri Mendeleyev.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.000
Everything we know

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.000
is made of some combination

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:50.000
of what you see depicted here.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000
And that includes our own bodies.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:55.000
I recall the very moment one day

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:58.000
when I was searching for a pair of metals

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000
that would meet the constraints

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000
of earth abundance,

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:05.000
different, opposite density

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.000
and high mutual reactivity.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.000
I felt the thrill of realization

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:12.000
when I knew I'd come upon the answer.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:17.000
Magnesium for the top layer.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.000
And antimony

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:22.000
for the bottom layer.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.000
You know, I've got to tell you,

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.000
one of the greatest benefits of being a professor:

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.000
colored chalk.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:32.000
(Laughter)

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:35.000
So to produce current,

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.000
magnesium loses two electrons

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:40.000
to become magnesium ion,

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000
which then migrates across the electrolyte,

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.000
accepts two electrons from the antimony,

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:48.000
and then mixes with it to form an alloy.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000
The electrons go to work

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:53.000
in the real world out here,

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:56.000
powering our devices.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:02.000
Now to charge the battery,

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:05.000
we connect a source of electricity.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:08.000
It could be something like a wind farm.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:13.000
And then we reverse the current.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:18.000
And this forces magnesium to de-alloy

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:21.000
and return to the upper electrode,

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:26.000
restoring the initial constitution of the battery.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:29.000
And the current passing between the electrodes

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:32.000
generates enough heat to keep it at temperature.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:35.000
It's pretty cool,

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.000
at least in theory.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.000
But does it really work?

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.000
So what to do next?

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.000
We go to the laboratory.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:47.000
Now do I hire seasoned professionals?

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:50.000
No, I hire a student

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.000
and mentor him,

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:55.000
teach him how to think about the problem,

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.000
to see it from my perspective

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.000
and then turn him loose.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.000
This is that student, David Bradwell,

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.000
who, in this image,

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:06.000
appears to be wondering if this thing will ever work.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.000
What I didn't tell David at the time

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:11.000
was I myself wasn't convinced it would work.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.000
But David's young and he's smart

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.000
and he wants a Ph.D.,

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:17.000
and he proceeds to build --

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.000
(Laughter)

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.000
He proceeds to build

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.000
the first ever liquid metal battery

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.000
of this chemistry.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:28.000
And based on David's initial promising results,

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.000
which were paid

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:33.000
with seed funds at MIT,

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:36.000
I was able to attract major research funding

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.000
from the private sector

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.000
and the federal government.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:43.000
And that allowed me to expand my group to 20 people,

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.000
a mix of graduate students, post-docs

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.000
and even some undergraduates.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:50.000
And I was able to attract really, really good people,

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.000
people who share my passion

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:54.000
for science and service to society,

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:58.000
not science and service for career building.

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.000
And if you ask these people

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.000
why they work on liquid metal battery,

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:04.000
their answer would hearken back

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:06.000
to President Kennedy's remarks

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:09.000
at Rice University in 1962

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.000
when he said -- and I'm taking liberties here --

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.000
"We choose to work on grid-level storage,

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.000
not because it is easy,

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.000
but because it is hard."

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:23.000
(Applause)

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:27.000
So this is the evolution of the liquid metal battery.

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:30.000
We start here with our workhorse one watt-hour cell.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.000
I called it the shotglass.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:35.000
We've operated over 400 of these,

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:38.000
perfecting their performance with a plurality of chemistries --

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.000
not just magnesium and antimony.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:43.000
Along the way we scaled up to the 20 watt-hour cell.

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.000
I call it the hockey puck.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:47.000
And we got the same remarkable results.

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.000
And then it was onto the saucer.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.000
That's 200 watt-hours.

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.000
The technology was proving itself

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:56.000
to be robust and scalable.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.000
But the pace wasn't fast enough for us.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.000
So a year and a half ago,

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.000
David and I,

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.000
along with another research staff-member,

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.000
formed a company

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.000
to accelerate the rate of progress

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.000
and the race to manufacture product.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.000
So today at LMBC,

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.000
we're building cells 16 inches in diameter

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.000
with a capacity of one kilowatt-hour --

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:19.000
1,000 times the capacity

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:21.000
of that initial shotglass cell.

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:23.000
We call that the pizza.

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:26.000
And then we've got a four kilowatt-hour cell on the horizon.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.000
It's going to be 36 inches in diameter.

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.000
We call that the bistro table,

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.000
but it's not ready yet for prime-time viewing.

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.000
And one variant of the technology

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:38.000
has us stacking these bistro tabletops into modules,

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:41.000
aggregating the modules into a giant battery

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.000
that fits in a 40-foot shipping container

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:45.000
for placement in the field.

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:48.000
And this has a nameplate capacity of two megawatt-hours --

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.000
two million watt-hours.

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:52.000
That's enough energy

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.000
to meet the daily electrical needs

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.000
of 200 American households.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:59.000
So here you have it, grid-level storage:

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:02.000
silent, emissions-free,

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:04.000
no moving parts,

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:06.000
remotely controlled,

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:09.000
designed to the market price point

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:12.000
without subsidy.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.000
So what have we learned from all this?

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:20.000
(Applause)

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.000
So what have we learned from all this?

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.000
Let me share with you

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:27.000
some of the surprises, the heterodoxies.

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:29.000
They lie beyond the visible.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:31.000
Temperature:

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.000
Conventional wisdom says set it low,

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:35.000
at or near room temperature,

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:38.000
and then install a control system to keep it there.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.000
Avoid thermal runaway.

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:43.000
Liquid metal battery is designed to operate at elevated temperature

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:46.000
with minimum regulation.

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:49.000
Our battery can handle the very high temperature rises

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:53.000
that come from current surges.

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:56.000
Scaling: Conventional wisdom says

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:58.000
reduce cost by producing many.

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:01.000
Liquid metal battery is designed to reduce cost

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:04.000
by producing fewer, but they'll be larger.

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:06.000
And finally, human resources:

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:08.000
Conventional wisdom says

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:10.000
hire battery experts,

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:12.000
seasoned professionals,

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:15.000
who can draw upon their vast experience and knowledge.

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:17.000
To develop liquid metal battery,

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:20.000
I hired students and post-docs and mentored them.

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:22.000
In a battery,

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:25.000
I strive to maximize electrical potential;

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:27.000
when mentoring,

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:29.000
I strive to maximize human potential.

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:31.000
So you see,

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:33.000
the liquid metal battery story

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:35.000
is more than an account

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:37.000
of inventing technology,

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.000
it's a blueprint

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:42.000
for inventing inventors, full-spectrum.

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:53.000
(Applause)
